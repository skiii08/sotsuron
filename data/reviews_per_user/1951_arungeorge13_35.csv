Ford v Ferrari," Engaging all the way to the finish line! [+80%]
","Driven by a high-speed bromance between two of Hollywood's finest (Bale and Damon), Ford v Ferrari is a fantastic film both on counts of character development and racing set-pieces. The writers (the Butterworths and Jason Keller) set the film between 1963 and 1966, giving the characters of Caroll Shelby (Damon), Ken Miles (Bale), Mollie Miles (Balfe), Peter Miles (Jupe), Iacocca (Bernthal), and Henry Ford II (Letts) sufficient time, screen-space, and dialogues to be built from the ground up.Even for viewers who aren't into automobiles, Ford v Ferrari will be an enjoyable watch owing to Mangold's energetic direction and the screen chemistry between Damon and Bale. Their friendship has been written and portrayed with the kind of warmth that everyone is bound to find engaging. There are differences in tastes and opinions, but when the duo gets down to the racing business, it's all respect for each other. Shelby, a notable (former) race car driver and automotive designer, is the DRIVING FORCE and Miles, a World War II veteran is the DRIVER here. The dynamics between them are brilliant and truly a sight to see on the screen.Ford v Ferrari also succeeds in building up great supporting acts - a tongue-in-cheek Iacocca, a concerned wife in Mollie, a somewhat adorable Petey, a no-nonsense Henry Ford II, a cunning Leo Beebe, and a seething Enzo Ferrari. As much as the film is about the rivalry between the two automobile giants, it's about the drama (a.k.a the little things) too. Like, Miles having a moment with his wife and kid, Shelby contemplating his career, a funny-as-hell tussle between Shelby and Miles, and sleepless nights before the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Speaking of Le Mans, it does make sense for the viewer to have some context on this form of endurance racing to truly know what racers (in this case, Ken Miles) ought to have gone through.Ford v Ferrari has a thrilling final hour with one of the best-ever racing set-pieces to be captured on film. Mangold truly lets the cars burn the tarmac when they should, in a finale that looks every bit authentic with little to no CGI. This may also be why every crash-and-burn shot feels a lot more concerning than otherwise. There's also the scene set ten minutes before the commencement of Le Mans, with Miles walking into the arena with a teacup in hand to a packed house, Shelby next to him; the duo watch the cars being set-up, the Ferraris pass them by, Enzo's looking down at them from the stands; the tensive mood pervading the entire arena is conveyed beautifully. It's scenes like these that leave a lasting memory.This is a film that makes you want to look up more of the Le Mans if you haven't already. And that, by default, makes Ford v Ferrari a raging win in my books.",8,1,1,8 February 2020
10 Cloverfield Lane," Review - 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016)
","For much of the film, the title hardly comes off as significant. The perceiver in you has a lot of questions with regard to why a psychological thriller with claustrophobic traits has been named 10 Cloverfield Lane. What is the relevance? Well, the final act provides all the answers that the viewer (who was expecting a full- blown Cloverfield sequel) has been seeking.The movie starts on a rather tame note. We take on the perspective of Michelle (although not by way of POV like in Cloverfield) who is still undergoing post break-up trauma. Michelle is played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead whose versatility has been proved with the passage of time. Her Ellen Ripley-esque role in The Thing (2011) was nothing short of tremendous. She is a perfectly bankable actor for scenes that involve high levels of tension and unpredictability. This fact is reinstated firmly by her performance in 10 Cloverfield Lane. Winstead is literally pitch-perfect, but we also have John Goodman (Flintstones, Argo, Flight, Hangover 3, The Artist) and John Gallagher Jr. sharing screen-space with her.To describe the plot in a single line would sound something like this: After getting involved in a car accident, Michelle wakes up in a bunker inhabited by Howard (Goodman), who is also its creator, and Emmett (Gallagher Jr.) who pass the news to her that the outside world is unfit for living as the air is contaminated due to an attack by some unknown entity. The viewer, like Michelle, doesn't want to buy this story and we get behind Michelle when she makes frantic attempts to escape the bunker.Twists are carefully revealed one after another and soon we realize that things are not what they seem. Howard becomes increasingly dominant and peevish towards his bunker-mates and once certain facts are concluded, Michelle and Emmett hatch a plan to escape the bunker for good. The outcome is unexpected and thrilling. John Goodman steals the show with his enthralling performance that is almost perfectly in sync with Winstead's. Gallagher Jr. provides the much- needed comic relief during the tensive build-up.One question still remains. How does all this fit into a 'Cloverfield' movie? Answers await in the final act. After a brief scene involving a brilliantly choreographed tussle, the viewer does heave a sigh of relief, only to realize that there are bigger dangers lurking on stand-by. The last quarter hour sure has ample edge-of-the seat moments (although involving extensive use of CG) and leads to a nail-biter of a finale, somewhat reminiscent of the climax sequence in The Thing (2011); only better this time around, thanks to some diligent writing by Josh Campbell, Mathew Stuecken and more significantly Damien Chazelle (of Whiplash fame).Fans of the original Cloverfield have reasons aplenty to be both happy and sad about 10 Cloverfield Lane. This one is not POV, the storyline deals with claustrophobic elements and isolation for most part and it is not directly connected to Drew Goddard/Matt Reeves' Cloverfield. But where it succeeds is in creating implied tension with respect to fear of the unknown. Is the air out there really contaminated? Who was responsible for the attack? What really led them to take refuge in a bunker? Winstead and Goodman prove to be near-perfect casting choices for a film that is brilliantly written by the trio of Campbell, Stuecken and Chazelle, and masterfully directed by Dan Trachtenberg. Music by Bear McCreary, cinematography by Jeff Cutter and editing by Stefan Grube are worthy of mention. The music builds apprehension, camera-work is brisk (but not headache-inducing) especially towards the climax and the edits make sure the run-time does not exceed a decent 1 hour 40 minutes.",7,1,1,6 June 2017
It," Feeding on your fears! [+67%]
","'It' has a spectacular opening scene. Little Georgie goes out to play in the rain with his new boat (made by his brother Bill) but finds himself encountering an eerie-looking clown in a sewer. Here, director Andy Muschietti (of 'Mama' fame) and writers Cary Fukunaga (writer/director of 'Sin Nombre' & 'Beasts of No Nation' and director of 'Jane Eyre') and Chase Palmer get right to the point and offer in a nutshell, what the movie is going to be all about. In the town of Derry, a bunch of kids (that comprises of Bill, Richie, Eddie and Stan) who tag themselves the 'Losers Club' are persistently hazed by the school bullies and begin experiencing distinctive hallucinatory nightmares prominently featuring a shape- shifting clown by the name of Pennywise. They're joined unexpectedly by Beverly, their classmate who's labeled a 'slut', and by Mike, whom they happen to aid in fending off the bullies. Director Muschietti succeeds to an extent in overturning the demon- horror-movie template that Hollywood seems to have embraced in recent times. The usual 'fright followed by a short span of peace followed by fright' format is done away with. Muschietti chooses to never let the viewer breathe easy, effectively blinding harrowing scares with humorous dialogue sprinkled heavily with F-bombs. Well, then the question arises for the viewer on whether these kids are worth backing. The answer is both Yes and No. Bill's yearning to find closure for his brother's unnatural death is believable. Ben, a chubby loner who loves looking up history (and has a secret crush on Beverly) is also a neatly written character. Richie, the foul mouthed attention-seeker is half-written but his lines evoke the kind of reaction that they're supposed to. Stan and Eddie too don't really stand out but at least we know the quaint bits - Stan's Jewish and scared of contamination too much, while Eddie is a hypochondriac.Their individual encounters with the demon (that takes up the form of a headless boy, a living painting - an obvious nod to Muschietti's earlier flick 'Mama', and a leper) are dexterously shot, performed well by the respective actors and backed by blood- curdling imagery (mostly using CGI). Fukunaga's insightful writing backs Muschietti's knack for formidable scares in a great way. It is indeed a wonder how the kids of the town manage to keep their heads up and be excited about summer when horrible things like disappearances and delusions are happening around them. The romantic angles between Bill-Beverly and Ben-Beverly are silly, adorable and childish as they're supposed to be. Where they could've improved a bit was on the characterization of the parents. Most of them (whenever shown on screen) seemed to despise their kids' presence, be sexually turned on, or appalled at their antics.Even though the film runs for a 135 minutes, there aren't a lot of instances that make the viewer question the decisions taken by the protagonists or ostensibly feel bored by the proceedings. A lot of the action unfolds at rapid pace, not giving the audience a chance for second thoughts. For lovers of the novel and the mini-series, there should be plenty to cherish. Skaarsgard plays Pennywise to near-perfection and his efforts are reinforced by masterful application of CGI. The climax too, is engineered adequately well to incite viewer interest in a sequel. Verdict: Definitely one of the better horror films of the year!",7,4,9,11 September 2017
Rocketman," Egerton is simply magnificent in his portrayal of Elton John! [+68%]
","Six-line Review: The stand-out feature of this musical biopic is Egerton's stunning performance. He is ably supported by Jamie Bell, Richard Madden, and Bryce Dallas Howard. Dexter Fletcher's skills in visualizing the various tracks from EJ's discography warrants plaudits. Lee Hall's screenplay tries to point out how fame and wealth often come with their own share of emotional struggles, case in point being Elton John's life at his musical peak. While the film did come across as slightly self-indulgent at certain points, it redeems itself with a scene where EJ speaks his heart out to the folks who played key roles in his life. Again, none of it would have worked if not for Egerton's dedication.Verdict: Worth a watch!",7,1,1,10 August 2019
Wind River," Taylor Sheridan makes a cracking directorial debut! [+70%]
","The man who penned the screenplays for 'Hell or High Water' and 'Sicario' - Taylor Sheridan, follows it up with a little gem titled 'Wind River', where he is also making his directorial debut in sensational fashion.The film is essentially about a rape and murder of a young native- American woman in the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming, USA and how it brings together U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) and FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) along with the town Sheriff, for the investigation. What's appreciable about 'Wind River' is how the writer/director allows the film to run its course in building the lead characters while maintaining a certain level of suspense. The weather is harshly cold, with blizzards coming in at the oddest of times, and environmental clues showing signs of obscurity unless decisions are taken quickly. Cory has a tragic past of his own that connects well with the proceedings in the present, making him half bad-ass hunter and half brooding dad. Olsen plays her part of the rookie agent well too, her expressions bang on target when she sees the victim's mom hurting herself and when she hears the sorrowful cries of the victim's dad. I liked how Sheridan made Cory speak out loud about his tragedy, allowing Jeremy Renner to showcase his solid acting skills, rather than spoonfeed the audience through lazily done flashback sequences. A late cameo from Jon Bernthal is a welcome change from his recent eccentric outings. The writing is as solid as it can get, and the narrative flow seamless. The 'cowboy' vibe is quite apparent, especially in the early scenes featuring Cory and his son. Plus, Cory deals with the baddies just like he's handling his quarry. Sheridan tries to raise a valid point with respect to the uncertainty in the 'missing-case statistics' of native Americans through extremely introspective story-telling. He voices his judgement against offenders in the most cinematically-satiating approach. Gil Birmingham, who plays the victim's father, gets to act out a few well-written scenes (especially the one at the very end). A few loose ends could have been sealed off better: there's a mention of a friend who dropped off the victim at the location where the crime took place - never to be seen or mentioned anywhere else. Also, the state of relationship between Cory and his wife was largely painted in shades of ambiguity. Nonetheless, these minuscule drawbacks should not deter you from giving 'Wind River' a watch as Sheridan is arguably one of the best yarn-spinners of our times.Verdict: Superb character-driven thriller!",7,0,2,5 November 2017
Knives Out," Tailor-made for the lovers of whodunnit mysteries! [+77%]
","Well, well, well... we have an engaging murder mystery movie featuring a spectacular ensemble (led by Daniel Craig & Christopher Plummer) in our hands. The character played by Ana de Armas (who I remember from Knock! Knock!, War Dogs & BR 2049) is what drives the film forward to captivating twists and turns. A movie like Knives Out is best savoured by not having read the one-line-plot or seen the trailer.The first act, in my opinion, is what particularly stands out. Private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is investigating the supposed murder of wealthy crime novelist Harlan Thrombey. Writer-director Rian Johnson carefully toys around the audience with a few leads, a few red herrings, and even a few shots that reveal more than what they're supposed to (a second watch will prove this right). Yet, it's Rian's eye for detailing that mostly works in the case of Knives Out. Craig is fantastic (as always) and his appearances out of the blue in certain scenes were a treat to watch.While Knives Out is a modern whodunnit, it really evokes the feels of reading an Agatha Christie mystery novel. As each page turns, you know you're one step closer to finding out who was behind the ghastly crime (or you don't, until the very last page). The mansion and its surroundings provided the right amount of intrigue for a storyline such as this. The score by Nathan Johnson also added an extra layer of obscurity to the proceedings. Steve Yedlin, a frequent Rian Johnson collaborator, captures the wintry vibes of Massachusetts perfectly.Knives Out is probably one of my favorite films of 2019 owing to two reasons: a) I totally dig murder mysteries b) Knives Out is astonishingly well-written and made. You may not be completely blown away by the climax twist, but the way the film builds up to it is impressive. Ana de Armas is going to have a lot of good-to-great directors approaching her shortly.",8,1,4,1 March 2020
Thor: Ragnarok," Count on the MCU to keep its fans happy all year round! [+74%]
","It's the third Marvel movie of the year 2017 and the third entry in the 'Thor' series. With New Zealand director Taika Waititi at the helm, we hoped to see a further lightening of tone as opposed to the first two installments as well as treading fresh ground in terms of narrative structure. Thankfully, Thor: Ragnarok delivers on both counts.The screenplay by Eric Pearson (who wrote for the Marvel 'One-shot' vignettes), Craig Kyle (the writer/co- producer for an array of animated Marvel DTV & television entries) and Christopher Yost is one of the smoothest to come out of the MCU - the segments are connected well, supplemented by an easy- to- comprehend central plot and packed with sufficient elan. Much of the dialogue seems to have to been improvised on set as the chemistry between the ensemble shows - a witty jab here, a neat pun there and a sweet slur too, somewhere in between. The cameos and Easter eggs in fact, warrant reviews of their own. Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) shows up quite early on in a scene that ties his character in close proximity with the Avengers; The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) is present in almost two-thirds of the flick and this time around, he speaks (not just when he's Bruce Banner, although the Banner bits are 'vintage-Ruffalo'). The 'Tony Stark' references ('Point Break' was hilarious!) are sprucely inculcated. Unseen MCU characters such as Ares, Man-Thing, and Beta- Ray are also nimbly referenced (in the form of stone-busts). If you've got a good eye (for Hollywood), you could observe Sam Neill, Matt Damon and Luke Hemsworth in minuscule roles as well (wink). Oh, and not to forget, Stan Lee's cameo as the 'barber'.The chief villain(ess) in the movie is Hela, the God of Death and Thor's sister, played by Cate Blanchett, who manages to 'steal the thunder' from both Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) whenever she's on screen. While it is appreciable to see a female main-antagonist for the first time in the MCU, there is very little fleshing-out done for her character (which hopefully, will be rectified in later entries). What's great about 'Thor: Ragnarok' is how the film all of a sudden deviates from the core, about 30 minutes in, and yet manages to keep its viewers thoroughly entertained. Hiddleston and Hemsworth (with great comic timings themselves) are aided by Jeff Goldblum who plays a completely madcap Grandmaster and the host of the 'Contest of Champions', Tessa Thompson donning the role of a bad-ass 'Valkyrie' who relishes her alcohol intake (and comes across mildly as a Norse version of 'Sarah Connor') and a CGI-'Korg' (voiced by Waititi - he reserves some of the best lines in the movie for himself, and makes sly references to his earlier ventures). The set-pieces themselves are a treat for the eyes, hallmarked by Led Zeppellin's 'Immigrant Song' (the original version and not a cover) that has its roots firmly planted in Norse mythology. The absence of Jane Foster & Co. was hardly felt.Waititi's attempt falls more in line with James Gunn's 'Guardians of the Galaxy' films than the previous two 'Thor' entries. Even when comedic efforts fail to hit the intended mark on a couple of occasions, the film is clever enough to quickly hop on to the next running-gag. As with 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople', every single character has a bit of eccentricity attached to them which they showcase in their own distinct ways. My pick among the set-pieces would certainly have to be the impressive 'Valkyrie flashback' which was shot using a technique known as 'Dynamic Light'. The climactic showdown is well-executed too: the apparent 'reincarnation' of Surtur being the cherry on top of the cake.The director has also ensured that franchise-regulars Odin (Anthony Hopkins in a cameo), Heimdall (Idris Alba) and Skurge (Karl Urban, excellent as always) made their presence felt. Loki is at his zany best all throughout and often towers over his brother, in terms of frivolity. 'Thor: Ragnarok' is by all means, exactly what the doctor prescribed in order to impart much-needed rejuvenation to the Thor franchise. Make sure you stay for the mid- credits (the post-credits really didn't add much) at least.Verdict: Seventeen films in, the MCU still has got what it takes to raise the excitement-levels of fans and casual viewers. 'Thor: Ragnarok' in particular, makes the titular character again feel integral to The Avengers, and teases 'Infinity War' in an amusing way.",7,3,7,5 November 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," MCU Spidey finds steady footing! [+72%]
","Tom Holland as Peter Parker brings to the screen an innocent charm that renders him instantly likable. While the first two Spiderman films directed by Sam Raimi still remain one of a kind in revolutionizing the iconic comic-book character, Homecoming hits pretty close to home in terms of entertaining the viewer. Treat Homecoming as a puzzle piece in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and one shouldn't have too much of a problem spotting out the various characters and Easter eggs. The writers have attempted to tell Parker's story from a fresh perspective, incorporating some of the super- villains in a highly intriguing manner. The main antagonist in this film is Adrian Toomes / The Vulture (played by Michael Keaton) who is apparently not on the same page with Tony Stark for taking over their 'city clean- up' job and putting him and his crew in a tight spot. This leaves Adrian with no choice but to salvage some of his findings and sell them off secretly on the grey market. Peter has been playing witness to some of the rather-petty crimes that are taking place in the city via the application of certain deadly weapons. He therefore readies himself to take necessary action against the baddies in order to prove to his mentor Tony Stark that he is indeed a true-blue member of The Avengers and not some random cameo-player. What I liked most about the Jon Watts film is the way it strikes a decent balance between Peter Parker the high-school nerd and Spiderman the superhero. Emphasis is given to Parker's personal weaknesses and sincere efforts have been made in the writing department (that includes Jonathan Goldstein, John Francis Daley, Chris McKenna, the director Jon Watts himself and two others) to merge the figuring-out-teenage part with the larger-than-life element. Some characters seem to have gone through a modern re- imagining. Take a look at Flash Thompson for instance. This Flash ain't the hunk you have seen in the comics or the earlier film versions. What we get instead is a relatively complacent geek who picks at Parker whenever he gets a chance to. No time is spent detailing the origin story of how Peter Parker became Spiderman. This is a Spidey film that strictly coheres with the Civil War storyline and moves forward keeping in mind the universe already established since 2008. As such, we have advanced technology replacing the age-old Spider sense and slick features added to the Spider suit (customized by none other than Tony Stark!)The female characters 'Liz' played by Laura Harrier and 'Michelle (MJ)' played by Zendaya are neatly integrated into the screenplay and add the much-required dose of tenderness to the film. The sidekick character of Ned (played by Jacob Batalon) gets a little annoying with his excessive mouthing of 'that's awesome!' and 'this is crazy!' but even he gets to redeem himself in the latter half during one of the set-pieces. Keaton is fairly competent in the role of Toomes and his Vulture costume looks intimidating. Downey Jr. arrives at significant junctures in the film, both to emotionally inspire Parker and to physically help him out (erm, blame them trailers for spoiling some of the effervescence of the set-pieces!). Favreau as Happy Hogan is lively as always while Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts shows up quite late in the second half but succeeds in stealing the one scene she is in. Marisa Tomei (who still looks absolutely gorgeous in her 50s) plays Aunt May this time and nails it (wink!). A horde of super-villains (Vulture, Shocker, Prowler, Scorpion) are either seen occupying solid roles or teased brilliantly for the sequels. The Washington Monument set-piece stood out for its first- of-a-kind setting that portrays Parker as suffering from 'vertigo' and concludes in uproarious fashion. The latter hour picks up pace and packs in a couple of delightful twists (one that arrives right at the very end of the film). The post- credits achieve new heights in hilarity. Cinematography work by veteran Salvatore Totino is free-flowing and while music by Michael Giacchino takes a cue from Alan Silvestri's work in the MCU all the while adding his own take on the vintage Spiderman theme. Verdict: Another triumph for the MCU!",7,4,9,9 July 2017
The Lost City of Z," Slow-paced but well-directed biography! [+71%]
","If not anything else, James Gray's 'The Lost City of Z' based on David Grann's non-fiction book of the same name will make you look up the life-history of British explorer Percy Fawcett and what led to his disappearance while in pursuit of unraveling the secrets behind the existence of an early civilization in the Amazonian jungle.This is most likely Charlie Hunnam's career-best performance, ably supported by Sienna Miller, Robert Pattinson and Tom Holland. A sense of poignancy pervades all through the film, even when Percy returns from his first few Amazonian expeditions in one piece. One keeps getting the feeling that there is something even grander to follow. The film unfurls at snail-pace, which might seem off-putting for certain viewers. The intimacy between Percy and his wife Nina is a beautifully-painted portrait. However, there are scenes that don't fit into the investigative tone of the film (especially the WW I scene, that barely adds anything except how it leads to the reconciliation between Percy and his eldest son Jack). The movie does suffer from a few shortcomings other than the pace such as its wistful effort in trying to bind the elements of jungle adventure and character-driven drama, which does not always work in favor of the film. Certain scenes could have been processed better or avoided. Nonetheless, this is a film with its heart in the right place and is mostly able to hold Percy Fawcett's name up high, in the books of history. Some subtle cinematography work from Darius Khondji, employing the right kind of filters based on setting, is one of the film's strong- points. Viewers who are familiar with James Gray's dilatory mode of story-telling will be able to gloat over 'The Lost City of Z' a great deal.Verdict: Lengthy but whole-hearted!",7,2,4,17 July 2017
Baby Driver," B-A-B-Y, Baby! [+77%]
","The first and foremost reason why I loved 'Baby Driver' is because I could relate to the protagonist Baby's (yes, his name is Baby!) fixation on recording sounds (and conversations) that he hears around him and making mixes out of them - yes, that's something I used to do when I was fifteen. Baby (Ansel Elgort) is a seemingly quiet getaway driver (one of the best that there is, point made clear by a superbly crafted opening chase set-piece that unfurls to 'The BellBottoms' by The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion) working for Doc (Kevin Spacey), whose varying crews specialize in undertaking heists. He carries a series of iPods (suited to different moods/occasions) and suffers from tinnitus (a condition when you hear sound when no actual sound is made) which he tries downing out by way of listening to music all the time.Baby takes care of his mute foster-dad (CJ Jones) and falls in love with a diner waitress Debora (Lily James) while bonding over mutual interest in music. What I like about Edgar Wright's films most is the fact that he puts realistically grounded characters in a purely cinematic setting. The film is set in modern day Atlanta but there are plenty of vintage aspects attributed to the proceedings: the picture-tube TV, the phone booths, the age-old method of stacking stolen money under a floor-plank, and the best of all, a portable walk-man (why are movies featuring the inclusion of a walk-man so entertaining by default? hint - Guardians of the Galaxy).The chemistry between baby-faced Baby and adorable Lily is played out surprisingly well. They may have known each other for just a few days, yet when two souls connect over their common love for music, highways and long drives, it is by all means a well-nurtured filmic trope. Wright's narrative ingenuity is evinced throughout the film: the couple's (unlikely) first date takes place at a laundromat that culminates in a transitional shot (the rotation of the washing machine seamlessly fluxing into a gramophone record) with Beck's 'Debra' playing in the backdrop.Baby's equation with his wheelchair-bound foster dad is also wonderfully expounded when they speak to each other in sign- language. Also, we have subtle bits of situational humor sprinkled throughout the film: like how one of the heist-crew members unknowingly buys everyone Austin Powers (who was played by Mike Myers) masks instead of Michael Myers from Halloween (as was planned); like how Doc's 8- year old nephew is a better observer than Baby (he gets a mint, haha!); like how the old lady exclaims WTF! when she is robbed of her vehicle by Baby who comfortingly hands out her purse, pop- culture references..there are plenty of instances!Now, onto the supporting cast: Jon Bernthal's Griff is absent post the opening sequence, so I really wonder they billed him as top cast. In the limited screen-time that he is seen, he pulls off an intimidating yet funny gangster. Spacey sortof repeats his '21' act but still manages to stand-out with his sarcasm-filled quips. Jamie Foxx's character Bats is expected to appear unthinkingly menacing and he does exactly what's required of him. Eiza Gonzalez's Darling is imagined to be wildly seductive and she fits the role to the T. Jon Hamm plays the major antagonist Buddy - a gangster with a wild past, who tries to get back at Baby for reasons that cannot be *spoiled*.Wright (with his cinematography & edit department regulars - Bill Pope and Paul Machliss respectively) has tried to package 'Baby Driver' as one long, exciting music-video with most crowd-pleasing elements inculcated. Kudos to Wright and crew for coming up with something utterly authentic in an era that is punctuated by reboots and remakes. 'Baby Driver' is a fantastically handcrafted concoction of humor, thrills and romance, powered by a kick-ass soundtrack.Verdict: Must-see!",8,1,3,19 September 2017
Justice League," DCEU ensemble film feels rushed! [+53%]
","I'll admit this: 'Justice League' isn't the worst DCEU film out there (the worst one is 'Suicide Squad', in my books) but it definitely won't exude the kind of glee you'd get by watching a Marvel ensemble venture, even with 'The Avengers' helmer Joss Whedon doing some last-minute tweaking business. This is very much a Zack Snyder film in terms of tone, color palette, hazy character building, and CGI-filled action.Supes is dead, Batman feels guilty and before long, a bigger alien invasion looms. Snyder dedicates funky introduction scenes to each member of the League - we really didn't need intros for Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) as their characters were established quite capably in 2016's 'Batman v Superman' and 2017's 'Wonder Woman', respectively. Shouldn't the three newbies (Arthur Curry a.k.a Aquaman - Jason Momoa, Barry Allen a.k.a The Flash - Ezra Miller, and Victor Stone a.k.a Cyborg - Ray Fisher) be getting those extra minutes of screen-time for them to get acquainted with the viewers as well as to construct solid reasons for them to be joining the team.Also, the villain Steppenwolf (voiced by Ciaran Hinds) - sigh. What a mess they've made in shaping the chief antagonist character - his reasons (for even existing) don't come across as one bit worth the buy. Not once does he feel like a threat to humanity as such, or to the league. BvS addressed the issue of loss of human life as part of the superheroes' attempts to 'save the world' through plain human characters (the Director's cut is rather well-rounded). Here, we neither get to see the baddies from the eyes of the public, nor do the heroes seem interested to connect with their earthlings. It also doesn't help that, when it comes to the set-pieces, the spoils aren't apportioned slickly. In most cases, it's Barry Allen who gets the juiciest bit of the pie, comfortably stealing the thunder from the rest. And for those who haven't seen 'Batman v Superman' (or 'Wonder Woman'), 'Justice League' would pose a lot of questions, even though it possesses a narrative of its own.If you've had an eye for both Snyder's and Whedon's past works, it is quite easy to distinguish their individual contributions in 'Justice League'. Their styles are evidently poles apart, and when an effort is made to mesh Snyder's dark, brooding approach with Whedon's humanized character-crafting technique, the result turns out to be a mixed bag. Ezra Miller's The Flash seems to have gotten the maximum benefit out of Whedon's comedic intervention - he is quite like how Tom Holland's Spiderman is to Marvel. Aquaman and Cyborg, even with their separate 'I-save-everyone-else' scenes, don't get to leave a concrete mark. I mean come on, just look at the segment where Wayne asks Barry to 'save just one person' - where are such scenes for Curry and Stone? Simple answer - there aren't.Wonder Woman is criminally underused in this flick after her excellent individual outing in the Patty Jenkins film earlier this year, though I'd have to say I liked the idea of Supes (Henry Cavill) finally getting a well-defined sense of humor (even though he shows up quite late in the film - that isn't a spoiler, duh!). Batman/Wayne is less sombre in 'Justice League' than he was in BvS, and he kind of takes pleasure in reiterating his inability to lead the team (a not-so- subtle hint at Wonder Woman assuming charge in the near future).The mid-credits (fun!) and post-credits (story-forwarding tool!) do tease the DCEU's future in mildly intriguing fashion, but one is left to wonder whether viewer interest is still strong for further expansion of these story lines - the universe has been dealing with rough seas ever since its cinematic inception. Critics and audiences have both never held back from lambasting most of the ventures (barring 'Wonder Woman' which was an excellent standalone). 'Justice League' does have plenty of issues in its two hour run-time but there's one thing it somehow manages to do in between - engage. For an ensemble film with a $ 300 million budget featuring some of the most iconic comic-book characters ever, 'Justice League' falls well short of expectations.Verdict: 'Not-bad' just isn't enough for a movie like 'Justice League'. It needed to be ground-breaking!",5,2,4,19 November 2017
The Thing," 5 Reasons why John Carpenter's The Thing (1982) remains iconic even today!
","Forgive me for expressing my undying love for one of the best sci-fi horror flicks of all time. I (re)watched 'The Thing' for the umpteenth time today and my admiration towards the film and for all those behind it, has only augmented. Here are five reasons why the film will remain a cult-classic for the decades to come:1. The man himself. John Carpenter. Fresh off 'Halloween', 'The Fog' and 'Escape from New York' which were all commercial successes, Carpenter took over the reigns to direct his first studio picture – 'The Thing', which would be set in Antarctica and deal with a bunch of researchers who come in contact with an extra-terrestrial being. Unlike the one-massive-monstrous antagonist in Christian Nyby's 'The Thing from Another World', Carpenter wanted to present a more devout adaptation of the science fiction novella by John W Campbell Jr, and introduce a shape- shifting, human(or rather all living being)-assimilating alien. While this meant a lot of additional work, Carpenter seemed up for it. He shot the film in artificially frozen sets, and extensively applied practical FX to recreate the claustrophobic terror. However, the movie was a box-office failure, owing partly to the success of Spielberg's E.T and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner.2. Practical FX by Rob Bottin(A then 22 year old) Bottin worked on the sets of 'The Thing' for a year, a project he worked his butt off for, so much that he had to be treated for stress-relief afterwards. Bottin worked with concept artist Mike Ploog to design the various gruesome creatures, their transformations and assimilation phases that would take centrestage in the film. The creatures looked absolutely scary yet the suspension of disbelief while witnessing the set-pieces was kept minimal. The spider-creatures, the two-body assimilation, the defibrillator chest chomp, the dog-things, everything looked on- point and downright grotesque. What is indeed sad to notice is the fact that while the 2011 prequel starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead had also employed practical FX by Amalgamated Dynamics (ADI), they were almost completely replaced digitally with the application of subpar CGI. The irony here is, critics and audiences alike wrote off the 2011 film citing horrible CGI in place of practical FX. Even the 1982 film's FX were shunned by the critics at the time of its release. Some even went on to call it a moronic, B-grade slaughterhouse film that used stuff like rubber, foam latex, gelatin, creamed corn, mayonnaise, strawberry jam and KY jelly for its effects. However, when the movie eventually achieved its cult status, the effects work was slowly getting the appreciation it had always deserved (some uncredited work from Stan Winston too!).3. The minimal soundtrack by Ennio MorriconeThe minimal beat-and-eerie-tune compositions (especially the Main theme) make my hair stand up every time they start playing. 'The Thing' is also one of the rare instances where Carpenter himself hasn't composed the music. It was indeed satisfying to see Morricone win the Golden Globe and the Academy Award 33 years later for 'The Hateful Eight' which held so much similarity to his compositions in 'The Thing'. I'd rate the OST for 'The Thing' as one of my personal faves when it comes to music in film. An ironical fact is that Morricone was nominated for a Worst Musical Score Razzie. I wonder what those guys were even thinking (or smoking!).4. Kurt Russell (& to an extent, Keith David)Kurt Russell as helicopter pilot R J MacReady left the audiences with a character that was certainly going to be remembered for ages. He was a bold, quick decision-maker who did just about anything to survive. It is impossible to fathom another actor who could have pulled off MacReady so well. Fun-fact is that Kurt almost blew himself up while throwing a stick of dynamite in a scene towards the end of the movie. That climactic scene where MacReady and Childs (Keith David's character) finally sit down to share a scotch while they decide to wait out, is truly unforgettable. It is also notable that the cast comprised purely of men.5. Legacy – The prequel, the video-game, the comics, the theme-park attractions, the yearly screeningsIt took nearly 29 years to spawn another film set in the same universe (which ended up as a prequel detailing the events at the Norwegian camp mentioned in Carpenter's film), that was partially able to recreate the ambiance and narrative style but lacked memorable characterization and the replacement of CGI over practical effects made it look sluggish.The video game (that served as a sequel) received positive reviews and it was deemed an excellent showcase in survival horror. The 'trust' system was met with praise. Personally, I loved every bit of it.. the storyline, the voice-overs, the in-game mechanics, the seemingly impossible-to-defeat boss levels.Alan Dean Foster, Dark Horse Comics and Clarkesworld Magazine published comics based on 'The Thing' at different points in time, all contributing as off-screen prologues, additional material or simply as heritage for the film.Haunted attractions based on the film were featured at some of the theme parks in the U.S.A.It is indeed inspiring to hear that 'The Thing' is annually viewed by members of the winter crew at the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station during the first evening of winter. It is also viewed by scientific personnel at the Summit Camp on the apex of the Greenland Ice Sheet.",9,2,5,5 June 2017
Dunkirk," Ticks off most 'war-movie' boxes, without shedding a single drop of blood! [+81%]
","Two names apart from Christopher Nolan seem to have stuck with me after watching 'Dunkirk'.. Hans Zimmer (composer) and Hoyte Van Hoytema (cinematographer). Both these men rise to the occasion and furnish impeccable work for 'Dunkirk'. If the viewer gets a feeling of being right there on war-ground with the lead characters, due credit needs to go to Hoytema and Zimmer. 'Dunkirk boasts of a pulsating soundtrack coupled with mind-bending cinematography. While character development and dialogue are almost non-existent, Nolan takes the viewer on a journey that delineates the dire essence of war by putting higher emphasis on the aesthetics. When ships sink dime a dozen and fighter planes drop bombs like cows poop dung, one is left to imagine how war can turn out to be persistently brutal. The film is told from three different perspectives..land, sea and air. Episodes taking place at different timelines eventually mesh into each other owing to some smart writing by Nolan and editing by Lee Smith. A crop of well-known faces such as Fionn Whitehead, Harry Styles, Cillian Murphy, Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh and Tom Hardy play some of the more significant characters. Nolan's choices of wide-angled shots are something for every big- budget film-maker to conduct research on. The struggles of warfare and evacuation are depicted as jarringly as they can get..soldiers being welcomed into a ship with a warm blanket and jam toast only to find themselves gasping for breath a moment later when a torpedo hits, men who hide inside a boat waiting for the tides to get rougher only to find themselves under constant threat of being shot at, young soldiers covered in an oil-spill feeling aghast at the thought of being set on fire via air-strike..there are absolutely zero compromises made. The final act is pure masterstroke. The tension is upheld by Zimmer's 4/4 beat, speaking a language of its own. The action in the air is viciously exciting but gets sort of repetitive later on. It should also be noted that the film's biggest star Tom Hardy wears an oxygen mask almost 90% of his screen-time (Bane, Mad Max and now this! Surprising? NOT!). Nolan's adept writing also points fingers at the fact that the affairs of war are perennial in nature - heavy sighs are often followed by loud screams of joy, followed by even heavier sighs; humiliation followed by jubilation in a cycle of crests and troughs. 'Dunkirk' is a perfect example on how to make an audience- enthralling war film without rendering physical carnage and bloodshed. The horrors of war can be seen heavily in the eyes of the men at Dunkirk, and that suffices.Verdict: Excellent, but definitely not Nolan's best!",8,1,8,21 July 2017
Captain America: Civil War," Review â€“ Captain America: Civil War (2016)
","The Russo brothers, who had just mediocre films like 'You, Me and Dupree' and 'Welcome to Collinwood' to their credit, literally shot to the top with the excellent second instalment in Marvel's Captain America series. Also, Joss Whedon set the MCU ensemble bar really high with 'The Avengers' (2012) and 'Age of Ultron' (2015) (with the former being a slightly more entertaining film).Hence, the Russos had a behemoth of a task at hand while making the third instalment in the Cap series, which by the first look and initial story-reveal looked on route to becoming Avengers 2.5. And boy, did they deliver in style. Civil War is hands-down the best ensemble MCU film by far. It is a definite crowd-pleaser by all means, although we missed the likes of Bruce Banner, Thor and Nick Fury.Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the writers of Thor 2 and Cap 2, pen a screenplay that strikes a fulfilling balance of action, emotion, comedy, and filled with twists and surprises. Story goes as simple as this: Stark and Rogers are for and against political interference in the activities of the Avengers respectively, and this leads to the team splitting into two, and the events that follow form the core of 'Civil War'.While Marvel crazies already knew of the plot line and had watched several scenes of the film published via YouTube, it was undoubtedly a huge task to match the expectation levels set by the previous films. But the Russos have dethroned all previous entries by handing us Civil War. The way the screenplay tackles the character of Bucky Barnes is certainly one of the many highlights in the film. Sebastian Stan returns to play his meatiest role yet, and sheds more light on his Winter Soldier persona. As seen in Cap 2, the set- pieces in Civil War (both on the ground and in the sky) look remarkably well-shot and choreographed. So many swift cuts coupled with fast-paced action elevates the movie to a different platform altogether. Upper-cuts, blows, kicks and punches are landed neatly and put to good effect. The Leipzig airport set-piece positions itself right on top of the list of the best choreographed action sequences ever made on film. Trent Opaloch's cinematography is reminiscent of his work in District 9, Elysium, Cap 2 and Chappie.Well, it is unquestionably a treat for the senses to watch Team Cap (Rogers, Bucky, Wilson, Barton, Lang and Maximoff) go head-on-head with Team Iron-Man (Stark, Romanoff, Rhodes, Vision, T'Challa and Parker). The propaganda for each character is etched out with utmost subtlety. Captain America, Iron Man and Bucky Barnes take the bulk of the screen time and they pull off their acts quite convincingly. Daniel Bruhl's Zemo serves as a great antagonist pulling all the right strings and chooses to spread villainy by making the Avengers go against each other. Chris Evans is incredible as Cap, while Downey shines in a role that requires him to be comparatively subdued (and guilt-ridden).While it is unmistakably Cap's and Iron Man's film, Civil War fleshes out two major additions to the MCU in astounding fashion..T'Challa a.k.a Black Panther & Peter Parker a.k.a Spiderman. Chadwick Boseman does a great job with what he's been handed out and sets the stage for his solo film. Tom Holland appears to be the most promising Spiderman yet, and he gets to show off his skills in that wonderfully executed airport sequence. Also, that scene where Tony Stark goes to meet Parker is effing hilarious. Paul Rudd's Ant Man also made the proceedings a lot wittier and enjoyable. Every character shines in their individual roles, and credit should go to the writers and the directorial duo for giving each superhero an adequate amount of screen time. Except for Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye (who I felt appeared bland and underwritten in this film), all characters leave an impression that is sufficient for the viewer to care for their futures in the upcoming Infinity War films. Stan Lee's cameo towards the end was a nice touch.Marvel looks like they hit the jackpot here, especially with DC's Batman V Superman being a strictly mediocre film and performing way below expectations; they can allow to rest their heads for a bit because the groundwork for the Spiderman / Black Panther solo films as well as the Infinity War sequels have been laid out almost impeccably in Civil War.Oh, and hold on to your seats for the mid-credits as well as post- credits scenes.ðŸ˜‰",8,0,2,6 June 2017
The Conjuring 2," Review - The Conjuring 2 (2016)
","For someone who loved the old-school horror vibe of The Conjuring, the sequel is barely memorable. It's not about the performances. It's not about the grim atmosphere. It's not about the cinematography, editing or direction. It's just that, after a pretty decent start, it loses steam big time towards the middle, and the viewer is left with little to care, when things start to make more sense towards the end. The way in which this whole saga transpired is what disappointed me, as a viewer.The first instalment definitely towers over the sequel in almost every way. Much to the dismay of the viewer, the storyline itself seems like a toned-down rehash of their Rhode Island adventure from the first film. This time, the setting is Enfield, North London. Peggy Hodgson, a single mother of four seems to be experiencing the paranormal and the Warrens are called in to help. Lorraine seems to be undergoing some sort of psychological turmoil, after the couple had dealt with the Amityville Haunting (the scenes of which are shown in the initial part of the movie). She seems to have this recurring vision of a Demon Nun haunting her and trying to harm her husband.Much like the sequels in another series by James Wan, Insidious, this one too starts on a promising note. The first seance is well- executed and brings goosebumps for old-school horror junkies. The Demon Nun seemed good for a terrifyingly scary villain. Later, the scene shifts to England where we are introduced to the Hodgsons and a few scenes in the night involving the kids mostly waking to loud thuds, frightening noises, and toys moving by themselves. The jump- scares are decent, but they lack innovation. They are very straight- forward, in the sense, the viewer is able to predict exactly when they are going to happen.A few fright-nights later, one of the kids, Janet, shows signs that she is possessed by a spirit of an old man who used to own the house they live in, and finally the Warrens stop by. The scares are surprisingly low in the mid-portions and this is where the film falters in engrossing the viewer. The old man's spirit is somewhat akin to the Freddy Krueger character. His presence might pose as a viable threat for a scene or two, but definitely not for a stretch lasting more than 45 minutes. Plus, more than just ghastly makeup effects, James Wan chooses to take the mechanical route and wants the viewer to ingest the paranormal existence the same way the kids in the film do. Unfortunately, that R-rating will make sure only adults see the film and I'm pretty confident when I say that many of us will find this mid-segment (or let's say the connecting piece), downright dull.The scenes involving the Demon Nun are highly intriguing as well as disconcerting, and I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed these bits. Much like the Lipstick-Face Demon from Insidious (2010), the Demon Nun possesses that X-factor fit for a daunting antagonist persona, gelling with the mood of the film perfectly. I was hoping to catch more petrifying scenes that showcased the Demon Nun's presence but sadly, the entity disappears midway only to show up at the climax (as a supposed big twist, meh!). James Wan and his cinematographer Don Burgess try their best to juggle perspectives and angles inside the minimalist haunted-house setup. Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) continue to appear an endearing couple plagued by the paranormal and their on-screen chemistry is splendidly portrayed. However, they could have benefited from a more revised screenplay that consistently maintained an unsettling vibe. The twins Chad & Carey Hayes, and James Wan himself contributed to the screenplay, apart from a later rewrite from David Leslie Johnson.To put it bluntly, there is not a single scene in this film that sends chills down our spine such as the 'hide-and-seek-clap' sequence from the first film. A possessed Lili Taylor was much more intimidating than a possessed Madison Wolfe. The Perrons from Rhode Island warranted more attention than the Hodgsons from Enfield. Who knows, the Crooked Man toy may get even its own film, similar to Annabelle. For now, I am just gonna cling on to the first film and sincerely hope James Wan scores a winner the next time around.",5,7,9,6 June 2017
Yesterday," A feel-good drama that's less of a Beatles tribute and more of a regular rom-com! [+57%]
","Short Review: Yesterday isn't amongst Danny Boyle's best work but it's the simplicity of the screenplay and the warm performances from Himesh Patel and Lily James that keeps the proceedings breezy. That being said, the film explores little aside from what we already know about (the iconic songs by) The Beatles. The songs themselves are placed pretty neatly, yet I felt they could have been used to enhance the screenplay in a much better way. In the end, Yesterday doubles down to a typical 'long-term friendship that was always a romance from the get-go' amid which the greatness of The Beatles sort of gets lost.The dialogues are pretty corny at times too, with Kate McKinnon's character being in-your-face for no apparent reason (but to sound insultingly funny!). Ed Sheeran's presence in the film is also not utilized to the fullest and could have easily been a watered-down cameo. Yet, the lead pair and some all-time Beatles classics ensure that Yesterday remains compelling from start to finish.",6,0,0,21 September 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Cinematically, Endgame is everything an MCU fan could have hoped for! Plotwise, it chews slightly more than it can swallow. [+83%]
","Having followed the Marvel Cinematic Universe for the last eleven years, Endgame proves to be an extremely satisfying conclusion to the current phase. The damage had been done in Infinity War (which I thought was superior from a storyline perspective) and it's up to the remaining Avengers to undo the catastrophe. The route that they take is pretty far-fetched (yes, there's a time-travel subplot involved; and that's not a spoiler!), but entertaining nonetheless. An attempt is made to retrieve each of the six Infinity Stones from different timelines thereby negating the destruction done by Thanos.It takes a while before the Avengers assemble once again - Thor is chilling (and growing fat in the process) with his buddies in a make-believe Asgard; Stark is enjoying his family life; Banner is living a life as a Banner-Hulk mutation; Rogers, Natasha, Rocket, Danvers, Rhodey, and a few others are responsible for (low-key) taking care of unruly happenings around the world (and reporting them to base). But it's the return of two major characters (Barton and Lang) who were absent during the events of Infinity War that sets the story in motion once again. Once the team is reunited and their strategy is unfolded, Endgame gets super engaging.I like how the Russos retained the Ragnarok vibe for Thor. He regrets his decision of not having aimed for Thanos' head when the had the chance to. In Endgame, he's got a beer belly, loves video-games (and an indoor life), and has grown a scraggly beard. He's still got a great sense of humor though. And what could have been an abomination of a character instead, turns out to be more-than-exciting. Stark, on the other hand, has settled down into a quiet countryside life with his wife Pepper and daughter Morgan. Cap is the only one among the lead trio who hasn't 'retired' officially and is still dispensing his Avenger duties in a less showy manner. The screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, in fact, provides emotional closure for almost all the lead characters that drove the MCU to its massive success in the last decade. That way, Endgame is an astounding success.But, in the process, the film also reduces Thanos to a plain-vanilla bad guy as opposed to his reason-driven intentions in Infinity War. I believe there is no cinematic device that's more difficult to pull off than 'time-travel' and here too, it's got some issues. X-Men: Days of Future Past was one movie that managed to effectively work it out. In Endgame, everything is explained very briefly (while dissing Back To The Future and The Terminator movies) in a way that it needs to make sense only when the concept is in question and not throughout the entire film. Well, maybe it does. Every change made to the original timelines would, in fact, result in a divergent timeline and altered character choices and motivations.With the humongous cast at their disposal, the Russos had to get things going rather quickly even with a 188-minute run-time. Also, the MCU has always been a character-driven franchise, and it did make sense to offer significant scenes to some of its earliest heroes. It's an enthralling journey, however you look at it, and it leaves the ardent MCU fan teary-eyed at the end of it all. The time-travel plot could have benefited from better detailing, but the Russos keep the proceedings fast-paced in the latter half so that the viewer doesn't go bonkers over the elucidation of alternate realities and timelines.Thankfully, it focuses on closing the books of Thor, Captain America, and Iron Man more compared to the rest. As an MCU fan from 2008 (right from the first Iron Man flick), I feel that was what I'd expected, and I couldn't have asked for a better ending (at least, from an emotional standpoint).",8,2,4,3 May 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Another Tarantino winner! [+82%]
","As is the case with most Tarantino flicks, the first half of Once Upon A Time in Hollywood sets the tone and builds the characters up nicely while the second half puts them in seemingly messed-up situations (in this case, real-life) with spectacular grindhouse results.The film revolves primarily around Rick Dalton, a Hollywood actor who believes that his career is experiencing a downward spiral, and Cliff Booth, his friend and longtime stunt double. Tarantino has painted both characters, played by two of Hollywood's biggest stalwarts DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, with sufficient shades/strokes for viewers to want to get invested in their lives. He attributes a backstory to the two characters and carefully places them next to the Polanski residence in 1969 LA. What a masterstroke!I read somewhere that the climax was what Tarantino wrote first and that shows! What a brilliant stretch of events the last 20 minutes is! It's everything you'd want in a Tarantino film by default - screenplay pulpiness, grindhouse feels, adrenaline-pumping action in a limited setting, Robert Richardson's captivating cinematography, and a rock & roll soundtrack that kicks major butt! Like in The Inglorious Basterds, he twists events to suit his wicked fantasies and comes up with a very intriguing ending.What Tarantino is a master at, is developing characters through well-written scenes. For instance, if you look at Rick Dalton's interactions with his 8-year-old co-actor Trudi Fraser, it sheds significant light on his breakdown (and the eventual boost of self-confidence). Another unmissable scene is Cliff Booth's visit to the Spahn Ranch and the subsequent events that transpire. One also cannot forget Booth's brief altercation with Bruce Lee, in a stretch that takes the realism/fiction blend one step too far. Margot Robbie, as Sharon Tate, is commendable! She doesn't have many lines but the short scenes that she features in, speak for themselves.In any case, Once Upon A Time in Hollywood is a must-watch. It comprises all the 'isms' that viewers associate Tarantino with. The retro-yet-contemporary feels, the fantastic-looking late 60s sets, the pop-culture references (and in fact, plenty of connections with Tarantino's own flicks) - it'll all leave a mark in your head! Tarantino has matured incredibly well and his solid crafting skills continue to impress. When you have a cast and crew sharing Tarantino's vision, the results are (obviously) stupendous!Verdict: Must-see!",8,4,6,27 November 2019
Get Out," Review – Get Out (2017) .. An excellent fusion of racial satire and horror! (80%)
","Jordan Peele's (of 'Key & Peele' fame) debut directorial is a must- watch for plenty of reasons. The social commentary made on the dark themes of racism, slavery and their implied horrors, the clever undercurrent of satirical humor, the eerily odd performances from the ensemble, the smart unfurling of twists, the Afro-American inspired music..pretty much everything deserves applause!There is quite a bit of homage paid to certain films such as 'The Stepford Wives' and 'Rosemary's Baby'. The early scenes carry an unquestionable sense of mystery, the screenplay is laced with umpteen instances that raise ominous questions in the minds of viewers. This is not a film where the main character keeps taking one irrational decision after the other. The writing is spot-on, and the direction first-rate. Daniel Kaluuya aptly underplays his performance, which is exactly what the character Chris warrants.'Get Out' doesn't exactly boast of a completely original storyline. Karyn Kusama's 'The Invitation' is another film that comes to mind, when it comes to the setting. Where Peele scores as writer is in some of those scenes where Chris encounters the dark-skinned servants of the house and a guest whose demeanor is increasingly unsettling. Deliciously packed at 104 minutes, the film leaves absolutely no room for second thoughts. The satire is never forced; it just meshes with the proceedings in a paranoid sort-of way.Quite frankly, 'Get Out' is the kind of film that is bound to fetch divisive feedback. People may not like the film for being in-your- face blunt at times, but thankfully it does not follow the regular tropes associated with a horror flick (such as jumpscares or bizarre flashback sequences). Instead, Peele requests the viewer to assimilate the characters, the decisions they take and their consequential impact. Overall, 'Get Out' is indeed a remarkable debut which is well worth the late-night discussion as well as repeat-viewing.Spoiler alert – The climactic showdown is delightfully messy with some spectacularly thought-out kills. Had to mention this, as the movie scores additional points on this front.",8,10,18,5 June 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," Review – X-Men: Apocalypse (2016)
","First things first, X-Men DOFP was by far the best film in the series. The movie shed ample light on the character sketches & plot, had some brilliant set-pieces on show, and of course a great titular lead in Wolverine. First Class, directed by Matthew Vaughn, introduced us to the younger generation of mutants and brought a fresh set of actors on-board. Bryan Singer, director of X-Men(2000), X2(2003) and DOFP(2014), yet again took over directorial duties to proffer the greatest X-Men antagonist of the 80s ..APOCALYPSE!The movie begins in 3600 BCE, where supreme ruler of Egypt, En Sabah Nur a.k.a Apocalypse, is betrayed by his clan to be inhumed alive all the while being protected by his Four Horsemen, only to be reawakened in 1983 to realize that much of the world has changed in his absence. He wants to regain control of the world he once ruled and decides to eradicate mankind off the face of the earth, in order to recreate it in his own impression. For this, he needs to acquire the powers of the telepathic genius Prof. Charles Xavier. Much of the first hour is spent in showcasing the recruitment spree undertaken simultaneously by En Sabah Nur, Mystique and Xavier at various locations. En Sabah Nur discovers his Four Horsemen in the form of Storm, Angel, Psylocke and Magneto, while we see the young Scott Summers a.k.a Cyclops getting introduced to the Mutant school by his brother, and Nightcrawler being saved by Mystique in an underground fight-club sequence. The rest of the film is how the confrontation between Xavier and En Sabah Nur, with their respective team of mutants, play out.It is refreshing to see the younger versions of the mutants take centre stage yet again, although not much is delineated with regard to why En Sabah Nur, allegedly the most powerful mutant ever, requires the help of his 'Four Horsemen'. Not that a superhero or comic-book fanatic wouldn't love to see those characters, it certainly would've helped had these characters been etched out a little more comprehensively. Erik Lensherr's story looked like it needed more detailing for the average viewer to care. It looked extremely rushed. These are some of the areas which lacked a smooth flow of narration in Simon Kinberg's screenplay.The crop of actors in Apocalypse however, makes sure that the movie does not lose its momentum at any point. Mcavoy does a neat job of playing Xavier, while Fassbender is great in the Poland portions but does not have much to do in the latter half. Jennifer Lawrence continues her good run, but like Fassbender, has a relatively subdued role in the latter portions of the movie. The cherry on the cake arrives in the form of Evan Peters' Quicksilver, who gets one of the best scenes in the whole movie. He, and Kodi Smit-McPhee who plays Nightcrawler, keeps the affairs light-hearted even in the most panicky situations. GOT's Sophie Turner plays the younger Jean Grey with much oomph. The rest of the cast pitch in with exemplary performances. Oscar Isaac, who plays En Sabah Nur, is amassed under truckloads of make- up, but tries his best to exhibit a sort of dark verve that is relevant to his character.The climactic set-piece is fun but tacky. Viewer interest is high when the villain has the upper hand, but at other times the scenes play out rather casually without much creative flurry. In other words, while you expect a big storm, all you are subjected to, is a bit of breeze and not much else. It is probably because DOFP was too good a predecessor and set the expectations bar very high. Nonetheless, Apocalypse holds its ground firm enough for things to get a lot better in the sequels. Wolverine's cameo was executed well, and the post-credits scene points all fingers towards the upcoming villain.As a closing note, it is advisable to treat Apocalypse as a gap filler unlike DOFP, which worked fine even as a stand-alone. Although quite entertaining with enough Easter eggs for comic book junkies, Apocalypse turns out to be an above-average fare overstuffed with characters not necessarily justifying the plot. The set-pieces do have their charm but are ultimately forgettable. Therefore, the film may not bring in hordes of new fans for the X- men series but could probably satisfy existing ones. Nevertheless, I'd still look forward to watching the upcoming Wolverine, Deadpool and Gambit sequels.",6,0,2,6 June 2017
Hidden Figures," An inspiring tale of three iron-ladies at NASA! [+72%]
","The going was never easy for Afro-American mathematicians Katherine, Dorothy and Mary at NASA. Their inspirational story has been (partially) recreated by Theodore Melfi and makes for an engaging watch. Though some facts could have been tinkered with, much of the misogyny and discrimination faced by these women at various circumstances during their stint and NASA (and elsewhere) are picturized in a believable manner.The friendly banter between the three women (especially the scenes in the car) is a scream. Spencer, Henson and Monae are wonderfully radiant and light up most of their respective scenes. Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst and Mahershala Ali and the rest pitch in with above-par supporting performances.It must have surely been intimidating for an Afro-American woman to work/study in institutions filled with scathing white men who tend to look down upon the colored. Katherine having to run half a mile to get to a 'colored' ladies restroom relieve herself, use a coffee machine designated for the 'colored', being denied entry at male-dominated meetings are just few instances where the viewer starts rooting for her character by default. That she is a wonderful mother only adds to her already-likable character arc. Sames goes with the other two women. Dorothy eventually goes on to head the programming department while Mary graduates in engineering, only by way of upgrading themselves through substantial efforts. The scene towards the end where Dorothy's white colleague played by Dunst finally addresses her as 'Mrs. Vaughan' declaring her newly-discovered admiration, is one of the stand- out moments in a film that boasts of several.The climax, although one that looks slightly tweaked to champion the presence of the three leads, is a well-cooked 'feel-good' meal. 'Hidden Figures' rightfully deserves a viewing for its affable performances and zealous writing/direction.Verdict: Inspiring feel-good flick!",7,2,4,25 July 2017
1917," Immersive, haunting, and brilliantly made! [+80%]
","1917 is a cinematic triumph in terms of its technicalities, the single-take storytelling style (like in a third-person shooter video-game), and the compelling tale it tells about war, survival, brotherhood, and compassion. Corporals Blake (Chapman) and Schofield (MacKay) are assigned the task of delivering an important, timebound message to another garrison - this story is essentially a race against time for these two young army men, and the camera follows them in real-time.The film seems to have been written keeping this design in mind - it's more of an adventure thriller than a conventional war movie. Roger Deakins offers an immersive experience of the two corporals journeying through hell to save a troop from falling into a German trap. At times, it even becomes difficult to differentiate between real and dreamy - the sets have been marvellously put together, the flare-lit shots look brilliant, and the fluidic feel of the cinematography keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.While it's easy to complain that character development is slightly lacking, there are solidly written scenes that give us insights into the (mindsets of the) protagonist duo - Blake's fellow feeling explained in the plane crash scene where he tries to help a German solider, Schofield's helplessness when he has to leave a woman with a baby behind, and the way both characters deal with pain and loss.The little but significant cameos from Colin Firth, Mark Strong, and Benedict Cumberbatch add to the film's strengths. The musical score by Thomas Newman fully supplements Deakins' efforts. Mendes portrays the physicalities of war by holding nothing back - the dirt, the decaying bodies, the ramshackle cottages, and of course, bullets and shelling. I believe Mendes has used his stage directing skills to the fullest in 1917.

Hotel Mumbai," Flawed narrative but compelling from start to finish, with an array of well-written characters! [+66%]
","What makes 'Hotel Mumbai' an engaging watch is the way (debut) director Anthony Maras has treated the rather sensitive subject - a real-life act of terrorism that sent shockwaves across the city of Mumbai a little over a decade ago. 'Hotel Mumbai' borrows inspiration from the documentary 'Surviving Mumbai' in its retelling of the ghastly terrorist attack that took place at various points in the city, most importantly, the Taj Hotel.Director (& co-writer) Maras and screenwriter John Collee have chosen a docu-drama style of storytelling for 'Hotel Mumbai'. It presents a host of characters that are either working at the hotel (Anupam Kher as Headchef Oberoi and Dev Patel as Arjun, a bearer), guests who have arrived at the hotel (Nazanin Boniadi and Armie Hammer as Zahra and David, respectively, in addition to Jason Isaacs' unlikable-at-first Vasili!), and some who take refuge at the hotel after the city is taken under siege by terrorists. The screenplay spends just about enough time to shed light on key characters before placing focus on the horrific events. It also bothers that the killings shown in the film are quite in-your-face (the exploitative nature of the theme is questionable) and every bullet fired from a terrorist's gun pierces through your cores.The main characters are reasonably nuanced (and humanized) at all times which make the proceedings compelling. In an unlikely situation of a terror attack where everyone, regardless of whichever societal strata one belongs to, can become a victim, the film builds this palpable tension in an effective manner. Also, there's a baby on the scene whose silence plays a key role while in-hiding and the probability of the toddler reuniting with his family keeps viewers constantly on their toes.That said, there are certain things that the film (purposefully) retains as cliches. For instance, families getting separated during the most unruly circumstances, religious/racial profiling creating rifts between surviving characters, egos at play between individuals, and many other plot devices appear rehashed from other thrillers. Editing work by the director himself and Peter McNulty ensure a crisp 2-hour run-time while the cinematography by Nick Remy Matthews lends the film a claustrophobic feel as the frames shuttle between hotel rooms, corridors, lifts, and emergency staircases for a good part.The film, however, makes a subtle mistake of not disclosing more details on the terrorists (the characters do engage in banter between themselves in addition to being supervised by 'Brother Bull' over the phone) even as footnotes during the end credits. Therefore, aside from the solid performances put in by Patel and Kher, it would feel less factual for an Indian viewer and more thrilling for other viewers. The director's intention here is to put viewers in the shoes of a victim or a survivor and feel affected by the goings-on. The film, without a doubt, delivers on that aspect. Having shot (partially) in real locations also helps to a great extent.",7,5,17,15 June 2019
Don't Breathe," Review – Don't Breathe (2016) ..90 minutes of cleverly crafted tension and thrills! [3.5/5]
","Uruguayan director Fede Alvarez (who gained popularity through his underwhelming debut feature which happened to be the reboot of the Sam Raimi classic 'Evil Dead') returns strongly and leaves a lasting impression with the home-invasion thriller 'Don't Breathe'. It is about a group of three thieves who wanna fulfill their American dream of making big money and moving to a big city. In order for this to happen though, the trio must rob the house of a blind man (played to the hilt by Stephen Lang of 'Avatar').The proceedings that take place over the course of that one night actually take up a bulk of the film and this is precisely where the writer/director has shown immense potential in thrilling, terrifying and shocking the viewer. 'Don't Breathe' isn't a film that relies purely on jump scares but the few ones present are placed at apt junctures and bring in the required impact. The atmosphere is spine- chilling, set mostly within the confines of a house that is located quite far away from the bustling city in a crumbling uninhabited neighborhood, so we the audience are told in advance that noise is not going to gather any public attention. But hey, the 'blind man' in the house isn't a weakling either. He's aroused quickly by even the quaintest of creaks or the sound of exhaling breath. What happens when he springs into action to defend himself and the reveal of a certain personal mystery regarding the blind dude apart from the money that the trio want to get their hands on, is played out in sixty-plus minutes of totally ruthless, claustrophobia-inducing frenzy. Stephen Lang is nothing short of tremendous, and plays the 'blind man' in near- flawless fashion. The guy's got amazing screen- presence. The trio played by Jane Levy (of the 'Evil Dead' reboot), Dylan Minnette (of 'Goosebumps') and Daniel Zovatto (of 'It Follows') are quite impressive as well with the former two occupying more screen-time (due to the nature of the screenplay!).The cinematography is solid (close-up shots in the pitch-dark portion stood out!) and although this is a film that involves a lot of physicality, and perspective-juggling, Pedro Luque handles it brilliantly (no shaky cam!). The storyline is not something that is completely original; if you simply go through the synopsis, you are bound to feel as if this film could be a cliché-filled exercise in torture-porn ( a relentless rehash of the magnificent Jeremy Saulnier thriller 'Green Room', offering cheap thrills like in 'The Collector' and bucketfuls of gore like in 'Saw'.) but Fede Alvarez gives you a completely engaging cinematic piece that tries to bend the viewers' minds in the quirkiest ways possible. The Sound and Editorial department deserve special praise.Once the trio breaks into the house, the viewer is constantly kept on the edge of the seat largely owing to the excellent performances, a screenplay that is determined to shell out thrill after thrill after thrill (maybe a few loopholes here and there but doesn't matter), fantastic sound design and some clever direction. Honestly, I did not find Fede's 'Evil Dead' reboot impressive at all (felt that the shock value was less dependent on characters or atmosphere but on excessive gore-spill), so I did not have really high expectations about this flick. This time however, it's a completely different scenario. Along with Mike Flanagan and Dan Trachtenberg, Fede Alvarez is going to occupy a spot on my list of favorite thriller directors of 2016.The less you know about the movie, the better. Enjoy this R-rated thriller and get your adrenaline pumping to good effect!",7,2,5,5 June 2017
American Made," The gringo that always delivers! [+64%]
","'American Made' is a semi-biographical account of certain events in the life of Barry Seal, a TWA pilot turned CIA-informant who doubled as a drug-smuggler. Liman- Cruise combo had previously made the excellent 'The Edge of Tomorrow', and Cruise badly needed to bounce back from the fiasco that was 'The Mummy' earlier this year. Well, 'American Made' delivers, for most part!Liman knows hows to capitalize on Cruise's charm (even at the age of 55), and make an entertaining movie around him. Liman has already said openly that this movie won't follow the pattern of a docu-drama and would not adhere purely to what transpired in Seal's life - i.e. historical accuracy will remain questionable (for instance, Seal was a plump, half-bald dude unlike the flawless-looking Cruise; Seal had married thrice unlike what's shown in the movie; even the timelines differ from actuality). It's strictly a commercial vehicle (come on, the tagline says 'Based on a TRUE LIE' - what more do you need?), with neat production values (the 80s setting is wonderfully rendered), first-rate cinematography and an assemblage of taut, breezy performances. Cruise is definitely in his zone here, juggling largely between the emotions of elation and discomfort. A tough job indeed, to condense someone's life into a 115 minute movie, but 'American Made' trots along like a little pony that seems to relish taking us on a fun-ride.There are umpteen number of cackle-worthy occasions integrated adeptly into the screenplay (written by Gary Spinelli, with some obvious improvisation from Liman & Cruise) that at times, make the viewer exclaim 'What the hell! Seriously?' but in a pleasurable way. Seal tries to poke fun at the characters around him - As a TWA pilot, he deliberately quivers the plane he's flying just to disturb the co-pilot's and passengers' slumber, while letting out a sly smile directed at the audience; he offers a pack of cash to the person whose property he crash-lands his plane (carrying large amounts of cocaine) on, and borrows his bicycle to escape from the cops; he is shown happily partying with the Medellin Cartel, even when he works for the CIA; at one point he has so much currency with him that he's stacked some of it along with the garbage pile..plenty of such larger-than- life yet funny instances that make the viewer dissolve into laughter. I laughed out loud when the local PD, the DEA, the FBI and the ATF all arrive at Seal's hangar at the same time to arrest him - what could be the odds of such a thing happening (for real)? But does it work as a scene in a film? Hell yeah, it does!Bold move to subvert the obvious sobriety which is usually associated with movies/TV shows that deal with the National Agencies or the notorious drug mafia of South America (and loaded with heaps of life-and-death situations) - the crew is never seen trying to inject an aura of despair - even when Lucy Seal (played by Sarah Wright, who's at least 20 years younger to Cruise) laments on how she cannot trust what her husband says or does, they still hold onto each other. But..but..but the movie does feel a little stretched than required, especially towards the climax portions - we sense imminent danger when Seal chooses to rat out the cartel and when his brother-in-law does some pretty-indiscreet stuff (like carrying a money-bag in public with notes sticking out through the zipper, naturally garnering attention of the local PD, amongst others). We know there's a twist coming - one that offers closure. Domhnall Gleeson surely seems to having a ball playing Seal's CIA contact Monty Schafer. Cruise apparently did all(or most) of the flying himself - an amazing feat, as these scenes looked spectacular. We need Cruise in smaller-budget films (and less in franchise flicks, except maybe for the M.I series) where he can perform without worrying about the box-office outcome. After all, Cruise is still 'the gringo that always delivers'.Verdict: Refreshingly breezy action-comedy!",6,1,3,3 October 2017
Joker," Phoenix knocks it out of the park! [+78%]
","What happens when the guy who made The Hangover series decides to cast an Oscar-nominated actor to play one of the most iconic comic-book villains of all-time? You just might not have expected something as dark and zany as 'Joker' to be the outcome. Here's an R-rated (supposedly) supervillain origin movie that screams DCEU but holds its own when it comes to storytelling and character development.Joker is led by an explosive performance from its leading man Joaquin Phoenix. While no comparisons need be made to the versions of the character brought to life by Ledger or Nicholson, Phoenix, without a doubt, has clearly taken the character to even greater (and more notorious) heights. The first hour of Joker is an intense slow-burn. Arthur Fleck is a struggling clown-for-rent-turned-aspiring-standup-comedian who is often rag-dolled around by twerps (for being physically weak) and despised by (rich) commoners for his unusual demeanour characterized by unwarranted stretches of laughter.The screenplay by Phillips and Scott Silver takes its own sweet time to showcase Arthur's gradual breakdown and eventual embracement of anarchy. The only bits of comforting normalcy are (apparently) offered by his mother, his next-door neighbor, and a talk-show host on TV. However, there's more to each of these characters than what meets the eye. The disturbing themes and elements in Joker indeed require a separate study of their own. That being said, the reasons attributed to Arthur crumbling under societal pressures are well-fleshed out and coupled with a haunting score by Hildur GuÃ°nadÃ³ttir, ravishing cinematography by Lawrence Sher, and the vintage Scorcese-like sets, the psychotic transformation (into Joker) is cent per cent believable.Phoenix owns every scene that he's in, demanding your attention right from the opening scene where he pulls his mouth apart to form a fake smile. If the sole purpose of this character study, as the actor remarked in one of his interviews, was to shed light on (in addition to lending some credibility to) the uneasy life of Joker before he turned into the vicious version that Nolan gifted us a decade and a half ago, the film is a pertinent win. It is Gotham city (before Batman) indeed, and what's Gotham without the Wayne family? The Waynes' presence in the film will also surprise you in more ways than one.What stood out to me were two (brilliantly written & directed) scenes: the first taking place in a moving subway where Arthur encounters three 'rich pricks' that sets the ball rolling for his 'transformation' and the second, during the climax stretch when all hell breaks loose in Gotham and a broken-down Arthur goes about his unruly antics amid a riotous mob. I felt the film did not require the 'extended climax' either, because the scene right before subtly told the viewer that the transformation was complete.But when you look at the version of Gotham that Nolan built up versus the one Phillips does, one feels that the cynicism and hostility of its residents have been intentionally amped up for greater cinematic effect. Barely anyone in Phillips' Gotham (except for a handful) seemed cheery or comforting. Probably, that's what the makers were going for. Ignore the indistinct political commentary and you have a disturbingly dark piece of cinema in your hands! No heroes-in-capes are coming to your rescue here!",8,3,7,2 October 2019
It Chapter Two," A painfully long, sporadically okayish Chapter Two! [+52%]
","Short Review: With a brutal opening scene that sets the tone for ghastly events to follow, It: Chapter Two delivers more of Pennywise minus the conventional scares. To summarize, the Losers Club reunites to deal with the Pennywise problem 27 years later. What made the first part of It so frequently entertaining was the chemistry shared between the wily, high-energy kids that the Losers Club comprised.While their older counterparts boast more screen-famous names such as James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, Bill Hader, and more, their camaraderie lacks the spontaneous spunk of their younger versions. Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd makes a triumphant return as Pennywise the clown and leaves the most opaque mark in the two-part series. What stretches It Chapter Two is writer Gary Dauberman's and director Andy Muschietti's attempt to stay faithful to Stephen King's novel to a great extent. As such, it renders each (surviving) member of the Losers Club with an 'individual episode of horror', most of which work only in parts.
While the budget is a lot more lavish this time around (and that's reflected in the sets, costumes, and visual effects), director Muschietti replaces the more authentic, unexpected scares of the first with frequent, super-loud, in-your-face scares that you can see coming a mile away. This makes It Chapter Two more of a horror-actioner and less of an atmospheric horror-drama.
Also, the climax didn't do me any good. Compared to the elaborate episodes that each member of the Losers Club experiences, it fell extremely short of what one would imagine needs to be done to overthrow a morbid menace such as Pennywise.It would have also made more sense to cut down on these fast-paced jumpscares to give viewers some extra context on The Ritual of ChÃ¼d and its true effects. With a run-time of close to 3 hours, you're bound to feel some butt-numbing effects instead. After a first chapter that turned out to be a pleasant surprise, I thought It Chapter Two (with raised stakes) barely managed to deliver. Yet, it just might be the true-blue summer blockbuster of 2019.",5,3,6,14 September 2019
Kong: Skull Island," Too stylized to be taken seriously![+57%]
","Jordan Vogt-Robert's version of Kong is a film where style towers over screenplay and characters. Previously reported to be helmed by Neil Marshall, it took nearly 11-12 years to reboot the franchise, and this film will be regarded as the second entry in Legendary's Monster- verse and is expected to converge with the Godzilla series in the near future, following the pathway of the MCU & DCEU and Universal's Darkverse.While Kong: Skull Island is not a bad film by a long shot, one is left to wonder why reboots/remakes still seem to be the primary agenda of Hollywood when there are plenty of original stories to be told. Leaving that question aside, how does Kong fare as a standalone flick? It's an engrossing ride for sure, with a couple of interesting characters thrown in, such as John C Reilly's Lt. Hank Marlow who has been living in an unmapped island for close to three decades, and Samuel Jackson's Col. Packard who wants to get revenge on Kong for taking down his men, and doesn't flinch a facial muscle when he comes face-to-face with the behemoth ape. The lead pair of Hiddleston-Larson don't really come across as astounding. While the initial hour lays out plenty of casualties and takes on a rather formidable outlook, the comic relief is brought about through the introduction of Reilly's character. Performances are pretty even, but none of the characters really stood out (hardly a memorable moment for any of them!).The film is mind-blowingly dazzling to look at..by all means a visual treat. Cinematographer Larry Fong (of 300, BvS and Now You See Me) captures the locales quite remarkably. The color tones applied are appropriate and lend a distinctive facade to each frame. The VFX is close to flawless, and Kong's battles with the other monstrous entities of the island are choreographed phenomenally well(although the practicality of it remains questionable!). This film's fairly low emphasis on its human characters (and the effects of their invasive deeds) almost gives the viewer a notion that it needs to be treated as nothing beyond a popcorn summer blockbuster..the expectation it does fulfill, while there's not much to ponder over when you witness the quintessential 'happy-ending'. Hint: Kong saves the woman (who inadvertently saves Kong) yet again!Post-credits ensure the crossover with Godzilla and co. in the next few years. While that's not something I'm highly looking forward to seeing, it would indeed spark a fair bit of interest as time progresses, given the kind of writing/directing/acting talent on board for all the upcoming films.",6,1,2,27 June 2017
Parasite," No one does it quite like Joon-ho Bong! [+84%]
","It's safe to say the Joon-ho Bong is one of the greatest original storytellers of our generation. The man's filmography speaks for itself. Barking Dogs Never Bite, Memories of Murder, The Host, Mother, Snowpiercer, Okja, and now, Parasite - that's the kind of portfolio to be proud of. Now let's talk about the movie in question here.Parasite is a darkly funny social satire that paints a subtle (yet not-so-subtle) picture of different social strata. On one hand, we have Kim Ki-taek (the brilliant Song Kang-ho), an out-of-work driver who lives in a dingy apartment with his wife Choong Sook (a mighty effective Jang Hye-jin) and his two college-age kids Ki-woo and Ki-jyeong. On the other, we have the well-off family of Mr Park that comprises of himself, his wife Yeon-Kyo, and his two children Da-Hye and Da-song.A series of events leads to Kim ki-woo getting employed by the Park family as Da-Hye's tutor. Then, we come across the master-plan executed by Kim Ki-woo to get each one in his family employed by the Parks. This stretch of street-smarts versus rich-naivety while engaging and funny, still seemed like it was missing the 'element of twist' commonly associated with Bong's films. But what awaits you beyond the first hour is utterly inventive. It's indeed twists-and-thrills galore, with performances by every single cast member rising to the occasion.Parasite, as a film, should claim a rightful genre to itself. It's a masterful blend of so many genres: comedy, family, drama (plenty of it), survival thriller, satire, horror (rarely), and many more. The social inequality trope isn't used for stirring extra sentiment. Instead, Bong cleverly plays around the concept and shows how intelligent film-makers can tell a story revolving around every section of the society without pandering to either. Most of all, Bong's attention to detail is impeccable and this pays off in several scenes.The film boasts several scenes (not moments, scenes altogether) that are worthy of further discussion. The subtext is impressively underplayed, with the second hour leaving no stone unturned. The climax is the best thing about Parasite (as is the case with most of Bong's movies) and it makes a giant statement - both in terms of storytelling and as a cinematic finale. Parasite is the kind of film that needs multiple viewings; a second or a third viewing will reveal even greater context about each of the meticulously-created characters. Also, two thumbs up for the production design and cinematography departments for making everything in the film appear so very real.Verdict: This time around, the 'monsters' are human, and they're more than fierce! A MUST-WATCH!",8,4,24,15 August 2019
Wonder Woman," Review â€“ Wonder Woman (2017) .. Patty Jenkins / Gal Gadot film is a winner all the way! [+78%]
","If you are someone who'd been awaiting that one DCEU film which was going to undo all the shambles we'd seen from Warner Bros. post Nolan's Batman trilogy, look no further. This Gal Gadot standalone film delivers the goods, and in style. The central characters are well fleshed-out and their motives distinct (except, as usual, the anti-climactic villain!); there are a couple of amazingly executed set-pieces, the message on the (futile) essence of war delivered loud and clear; ultimately, the film is what one would call a game- changer for the DCEU.As a viewer who constantly keeps track of the MCU and DCEU, shades of 'Thor' and 'Captain America: The First Avenger' were felt throughout. The story starts off at Themyscira, the home of the Amazon warriors, the landscape of which is pure eye-candy. Laden with lush green pastures and serene beaches, the kingdom is indeed a thing of beauty. Diana's origin story is partially established, she learns of the battle of the Gods and acquires martial skills as she makes steady progress in becoming a young warrior-princess herself.The going gets dark once Pine's character (Capt. Steve Trevor) inevitably enters the scene. Determined to stop Ares (the God of War) who has presumably taken the form of German general Ludendorff, Diana agrees to assist Steve in his pursuit to end the war of all wars (WW I). The conversational exchanges between Diana and Steve are laced with enough humor and flamboyance for even the average viewer to let out a chuckle or two, lightening the tone to an extent all the while trying to remain consistent with the darker, more relevant theme of the film.Predominantly a writer for television, scenarist Allan Heinberg does a marvellous job tying in the two universes with ease. Diana's coming-of-age (from a warrior princess to a Goddess in its truest sense!) is presented in an engaging yet insightful manner (based on a story by Snyder and Fuchs). Patty Jenkins (who helmed Charlize Theron's 'Monster') interestingly had to be the redeemer of the DCEU after BvS and Suicide Squad hit rock-bottom in terms of feedback, and she achieves what even the likes of Zack Snyder and David Ayer could not. She treats the material in hand with all earnestness, imparting the right amount of panache and cheer, as and when required (Snyder's stylistic touches are felt throughout, but added in right measure!).And Gadot..the word is WOW. She's got ravishing looks, the physique of a warrior and brings to the forefront, the kind of innocent charm and confidence a superhero(ine) of her other-worldly universe is expected to exude. Her performance is indeed the film's strong- point. Pine does a neat job playing the role of her human-foil. The antagonist character though, is slightly underwritten (there's a twist that doesn't quite hit the mark!). The opening set-piece at the beach in Themyscira and the one that takes place at No-Man's- Land are exquisitely crafted. (P.S â€“ I got goosebumps every time Hans Zimmer/Junkie XL's WW theme started playing during set- pieces!). Rupert-Gregson Williams' (Hacksaw Ridge, The Legend of Tarzan) compositions hold well for the constantly evolving Diana. Cinematographer Mathew Jensen (F4, Chronicle) smartly captures the enticing vistas of Amalfi Coast, Italy for the initial portions and employs appropriate color tones to denote the change-in-universe (a good portion of the film is shot in limited light!). Costume and Art departments have done remarkable work. Last but not the least, the visual effects (save for the climax sequence!) are splendid.They say a film that doesn't spoon-feed is more likely one that is bound to stay with the viewer for longer stretches. Wonder Woman, for sure, has set a benchmark for films in the DCEU and I sincerely wish 'Justice League' turns out to be a worthy follow-up. Kudos to Jenkins, Gadot and crew for hitting a home-run!",8,8,18,5 June 2017
Marriage Story," Baumbach delivers a raw, realistic stunner! [+81%]
","It's wonderful to see a filmmaker like Noah Baumbach (The Squid and the Whale, Greenberg) tackle a simple, basic subject and elevate it to greater heights. He has displayed the ability to convert a raw, realistic marriage-divorce saga into something so deep, mature, hard-hitting, and engaging. The brilliant writing (by the director himself) is backed by exemplary performances from its entire ensemble. Marriage Story did remind me of Asghar Farhadi's A Separation at certain points, but it's a film that's wholly American in its texture, its perspectives.Adam Driver (as theater director Charlie) and Scarlett Johansson (as theater artist Nicole) are both stunning in their own right. They make their characters appear extremely grounded and believable and it gives us the feel of watching the divorce proceedings of a couple that we have seen and known very well. While the core theme of a couple going through a divorce may not seem like fresh material for feel-good cinema, Baumbach actually makes it look earnest. The film opens with the two of them reading out (in their minds) what they love about each other only for the viewer to realize that they're sitting in front of a mediator.It's a solid hook for an opening scene. You're immediately drawn to the lives of Charlie and Nicole. You want to know what drove them to the point of separation when they just spent ten minutes talking in length about each other's strengths and adorable qualities. Baumbach takes the rom-com route to tell his story but in a strictly sensible fashion. The exes want to keep things friendly for their son Henry, but they soon realize that they're drifting away from each other. The lawyers of the splitting couple, Nora (Nicole's lawyer; a splendid Laura Dern), Jay (Charlie's first lawyer; a pointy Ray Liotta), and Bert (Charlie's second lawyer; a calmer Alan Alda) keep adding further layers to this increasingly hostile wedge.The dialogues score brownie points. They're razor-sharp, filled with sarcasm and double entendre, and delivered with potency by each member of the ensemble cast. It also goes on to show the intensity of love, relatability, and understanding between husband and wife who slipped up in their personal lives while tending to their careers. Baumbach makes it clear that the institution of marriage lies in its basics: the prolonged eye-contact, the haircuts, the tying of the shoelaces, the making of breakfasts, the monopoly sessions, and more along those lines.And oh, not to forget, there's a fair bit of comedy too, the kind you wouldn't expect in a film such as this. I love the way Charlie reacts to multiple people telling him L.A's got 'more space'. I also love the way Nicole's mom and sister prepare themselves to present the divorce petition to Charlie, just the way scene rehearsals (for theater or cinema) would look like. Marriage Story is incredible in the way it offers clarity to the arguments of both husband and wife before the decision is made. Its straightforwardness is incomparable.",8,8,11,25 January 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Neat work from Waititi and his cast/crew! [+69%]
","Irreverent humor (and/or satire) is a difficult genre to crack, but Waititi once again shows he can completely own his script and get the best out of his performers. To be honest, I didn't particularly find the first 30-40 minutes to be that amusing, but as the second act commenced, it started growing on me. The film beautifully portrays the warm, funny, and morose relationships between Jojo (a fantastic Roman Griffin Davis, who brings adorable 10-year-old-isms to the table with a dash of harmless, satirical fanaticism for Hitler) and a bunch of people around him - his bestie Yorki (Archie Yates, who has got great timing in humor), his mother Rosie (a wonderful-as-always Scarlett Johansson), and his new Jewish acquaintance Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie, who's wildly effective), to name a few.There's also his imaginary best friend Adolf Hitler (played by Waititi himself, getting the funniest lines) and Captain Klenzendorf (a bubbly Sam Rockwell) playing important roles. As I said, once you've okayed yourself with the nature of the film's irreverence, you're in for a joy ride. The second half features a particularly hysterical scene with Stephen Merchant making a cameo. To add to that, I need to give kudos to Waititi for transitioning between hilarious and heartbreaking in a matter of seconds, in one specific scene (cannot spoil it!) so brilliantly. I cannot remember the last time a shot of a woman's feet was used to convey something so intense and powerful.Jojo's transformation from a 'Heil Hitler'-ing fanatic to a boy fluttering with dreams, hopes, and humanity, has been written and performed in a very believable manner. In terms of wackiness, I'd give Rebel Wilson's character an extra point. Every time she showed up, hilarity ensued. Jojo Rabbit may be set in trying times, but it is a feel-good watch indeed, ably supported by its classy production design, pleasing soundtrack, and a lot of benevolence (a.k.a tying each other's shoelaces).",7,0,0,6 April 2020
Green Book," Works largely because of the solid screenplay and the stellar performances of the leads! [+82%]
","'Green Book' definitely plays to the strengths of its two magnificent leads Viggo Mortensen, who plays Tony Lip (a chauffeur who loves his family), and Mahershala Ali, who plays iconic pianist Don Shirley. The film is told majorly from the perspective of Tony, who at the beginning of the film is going through a troubled time after the club he works for, is closed under unforeseen circumstances. This is when he ends up taking a chauffeur-cum-bodyguard job for Shirley who's taking a tour of the South. The pianist makes his entry a good 15-20 minutes in, and by then, we already have an idea what kind of a person Tony is, and what his stand against people from other backgrounds is.The film builds the relationship between Shirley and Tony one scene at a time, and it does so, at an unhurried pace. Tony realizes how big of a talent Shirley really is, yet he observes Shirley subjecting himself to a tonne of atrocities coming his way by his contractors simply because he is a Jamaican-American. That being said, the film does make us ha-ha a fair bit as well when it's not busy trying to create a 'moment'. The scene where Tony introduces Shirley to Kentucky Fried Chicken is a laugh-riot!Shirley is safe in the hands of Mahershala Ali whose realistic shades make the character truly magnetic. Mortensen seems to have had a blast playing Tony and it shows. For a movie that has a legendary pianist at its core, the music (by Kris Bowers, additionally a recording by Shirley himself was used; Robert Plant also played a key role in recommending the kind of upbeat music that keeps the film musically rich) is pretty convincing. Ali does his bit to make us feel the effort put in by Shirley during each of his contractual performances.Linda Cardellini (who plays Tony's wife Dolores) and the rest of the cast provide ample support. Even if one feels that it employs the 'white savior' trope to an extent, the film, on a larger scale, is about how the Tony and Shirley play off each other during their casual conversations and the wonderfully brewing friendship between the two. The title, a reference to the motoring guide for the colored in the Southern part of the States from those trying times, is a subtle shade in itself. The motel-halts made by Tony and Shirley during their journey act as the playground for pivotal incidents that lead to strengthening the bond and levels of compassion between the trash-talking driver and the want-no-trouble pianist.Green Book makes you guffaw, shed a tear, and feel good at the end of it all - certainly worth the viewing! It will surely win you over with its earnest storytelling, outstanding performances, and the unconventional chemistry between its leads. Knowing when to be funny and serious, the film touches upon a number of concepts that require open discussion in the modern era. Peter Farrelly, known so far as the co-creator of several slapstick comedies (with his brother Bobby), strikes gold in his first solo directorial.",8,2,3,4 March 2019
Annihilation," Alex Garland conjures up yet another strangely beautiful sci-fi epic. Though, I must say, I enjoyed 'Ex-Machina' more! [+71%]
","As is the case with most Alex Garland films (when I say films, I'm referring to the films he has written - 'Ex-machina' is the only other movie he has directed so far) such as '28 Days Later', 'Sunshine', ' and 'Dredd', his latest directorial venture 'Annihilation' also treads the 'sci-fi-with-a-message' path. He narrates stories in which visibly strong (but intrinsically weak) characters try to deal with the existence of alternate realities. While Garland follows the same skeletal structure in 'Annihilation' as well, the film still manages to maintain its singularity.The film is told from the point-of-view of Lena (played by a nuanced Natalie Portman), a biologist (with a militaristic past) who signs up for a covert expedition into an otherworldly zone (known as 'The Shimmer' where laws of nature are seemingly twisted. Lena has her own reasons to partake in this quest, which ultimately leads to bizarre findings that blur the lines between real and surreal.What the viewers are in store for, isn't a straightforward sci-fi flick where answers are served on a silver platter. A lot is left to the judgment of the viewers - they can comprehend the proceedings however they feel like. This brain-teaser of a movie barely resorts to compromises in storytelling and leaves viewers to determine the solutions using their own interpretive thinking skills. The visuals by Rob Hardy are complemented well by the terrifying visual effects by 'Double Negative' a.k.a DNeg. Dangers arrive in the form of mutated alligators and bears and trust me when I say they're not pleasing to look at. The musical score by Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow subtly signify the eerie tone of the film. Natalie Portman carries her 'bewildered biologist' character with ease, while J.J Leigh as Dr. Ventress (the leader of the expedition) puts up a convincing show. Oscar Isaac shines (as always!), in a sort-of extended cameo. Verdict: Give 'Annihilation' a watch if you relish ambiguity in films!",7,1,3,26 March 2018
Alien: Covenant," Review – Alien: Covenant (2017) .. the set-pieces are fun, the storyline predictable! (3/5)
","Ridley Scott treads familiar ground in Alien: Covenant, the sequel to 2012's Prometheus, attempting a mish-mash of old school set pieces (involving lots of chest-bursting, face-hugging and gore!) all the while putting forward an engaging framework of events that would eventually lead to the first Alien film.All the usual tropes that one associates with a Ridley Scott Alien flick are present .. a sensible leading lady (who by turn of events ends up being the protagonist), a few effectively executed jumpscares, human vs. alien set-pieces, excellent cinematography and CGI (for most part, except that first encounter with the neomorphs). The actual villain here is neither the neomorph/xenomorph nor the psychopathic android David (played by Fassbender) but the predictable screenplay. The audience knows well in advance that more than 80% of the crew is sure to mutate/die; the leading lady is bound to survive against all odds and the supposedly big-twist can be foreseen quite early on.Ten years after the failed Prometheus expedition, the crew aboard the ship (Covenant) carrying over 2000 colonists and equivalent number of embryos, heading towards a distant planet are diverted due to an apparent indication of human existence in an unknown planet that looks ecstatically beautiful (but terrifyingly silent!) containing a sinister extra terrestrial presence. A John Denver song inadvertently sets the ball rolling.The only returning character from Prometheus is the synthetic David. Elizabeth Shaw (the protagonist of the previous movie, played by Noomi Rapace) is posthumously mentioned on a few occasions. As with Prometheus, this movie too leaves the viewer with a lot of unanswered questions especially when it comes to certain decisions that some of the lead characters undertake.Another underwhelming aspect of the flick is that the vastly expansive ideologies laid out in Prometheus take a back seat in Alien: Covenant, and the director instead chooses to shoehorn the viewer by including those factors which made the first two Alien films hugely popular. If Scott's idea was just to get the viewer excited about an array of possibilities that must have resulted in the events leading to the Ellen Ripley saga only to write most of them off in the upcoming (prequel) sequels, then I say that's not looking too bright for the franchise altogether.That said, given the anticlimactic ending of this film, there's plenty of scope to break new ground in the sequels provided the writing gets mucho better. I kinda enjoyed the gory set-pieces and the ways deployed by Daniels (Waterston) and Tennessee (McBride) to counter the neomorphs/xenomorphs, although the climactic showdown doesn't offer that much of a thrill-fest. Hopefully, these characters make it back to the big-screen (instead of being killed off-screen like Shaw) again. I also wish Neill Blomkamp's Alien 5 gets made too (as his visionary ideas could lend a fresh twist to the existing universe!).",6,1,10,5 June 2017
