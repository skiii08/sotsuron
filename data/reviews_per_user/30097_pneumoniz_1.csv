Lucky Number Slevin," Lucky Number Slevin is Worth it
","I really don't get where the other critic is coming from. It's actually nothing like Tarantino. If you know anything about his films, you would know that he actually is more of a time line director. I saw Lucky Number Slevin at Sundance Film Festival. It was by far the best movie there. It was in the premiere category with Thank You for Smoking and Little Miss Sunshine, so it definitely has strength. I laughed at this comment about Tarantino, because everyone knows that Quentin's first film, Reservoir Dogs, a favorite of mine actually, debuted at Sundance. I don't know where he is coming from, but I do know that this movie deserves all 10 stars. I recommend it, hell I'd pay for the movie ticket for this guy to see it again. Please, check this movie out!!!",10,12,28,3 March 2006
