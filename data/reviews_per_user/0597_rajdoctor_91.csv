National Treasure: Book of Secrets," The National Treasure 2
","I did not see the first part of the movie, but being Nicholas Cage's fan, I went to see this one.The story is about treasure hunter Ben Gates (Nicholas Cage) who unravels the pages of missing dairy of the killer of Abrahim Lincoln to find out the secret leading to the hidden treasure of gold. The movie opens with the shooting of Lincoln and then re-opens in today's times when Ben with the help of - nerdy geek friend Riley Poole (Justin Bartha), his girl friend Abigali Chase (Daine Kruger), his father Patrick Gates (Jon Voight) and his mother Prof. Emily Appelton (Helen Mirren)  solve the mystery. There is also a villain Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris) who is also behind the treasure. There are lots of chase scenes, moments of comedy, suspense, thrill  that leads them to Luxembourg Garden in Paris, the statue of Liberty, Birmingham Palace in London, the White House, the Mount Rushmore and below that the hidden underground gold treasure. In the end villain dies and the treasure is given to the US government.The movie is a typical commercial venture in the lines of James Bond and Indiana Jones movies with enough comedy, stunts, chase, geeks and good acting. Nicholas Cage looks haggard with his age, Daine Krugner looks good and at times reminds of south Indian heroine Simran, Helen Mirren and Jon Voight try to do justice to their small roles, but the scene stealer is Ed Harris in his small villainy role.The movie has its fun moments. The last action scenes is shot underground (mostly in a studio set) on a hinge platform, and I think that could have been made much more enthralling with greater variety of stunt (how we miss Steven Spielberg to do all that for us). This movie falls short to deliver the same rush of blood as Indiana Jones series, but is though enough to entertain oneself.(Stars 6.25 out of 10)",6,1,3,20 January 2008
Scarface," Scarface
","This is called a cult movie by cinegoers.The story is about an immigrant Tony Montana (Al Pacino) from Cuba who has come to live the American dream. He is a hard core criminal and starts by being in detention, where he plots a murder. Next, he moves in the Florida where he starts working as a dish washer on a road side joint. The attraction of money and power drives him into taking chance with one drug deal that goes miserably wrong where his friend is killed, and he in turn kills other gang members. With his daring, he starts climbing the ladder of drug dealers, and reaches the pinnacle of power and wealth and gets more and crazier (due to drug addiction). Finally he is shot by his own beloved sister before being brutally killed by invading gang in his own palatial home.The movie wholly belongs to Al Pacino, who breathes terrific life and energy to such a difficult and negative role. This is one the best anti-hero film I have watched coming out from Hollywood. The story very much resembles like a 1980s B-grade Hindi movie.I hear that this person was real and the story is inspired from real life incidents. But without Al Pacino this movie would had been totally rubbish. It is Al Pacino's antic and historics, weirdness and style, confidence and arrogance that floats this movie through out.The character though real is so unbelievable, but being a larger than life portrayal of an anti-hero needs such exaggeration.The film sets are gaudy and over the top. The characters are one-sided and sketchy. There is too much of violence. There are a few good musical scores that give good 80s flavor.I can imagine how this movie would have been a craze when first released. It still engages  but the time context is different now.The only problem with such movies  I think  is that it promotes unrestrictive violence and mayhem. It gives a message  being bad is good! Nothing wrong with that if common people on the street understand the difference between reel and real life and not try to imitate crime  especially in the volatile world of today where getting and using weapons is child's play! Even though this is Cuban crime / mafia movie it requires an Italian Director Brian De Palma to direct this movie.(Stars 7 out of 10)",7,0,1,7 August 2007
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat
","I had heard about this stupid character film Borat  whose real name is Sacha Baron Cohen who came up with this stupid TV talk show a few years ago and made real jokers of his invited guests.Now the same person has come with an even stupid and crude movie called 'Borat'. It has broken lots of box-office records all over America and the director of this movie Larry Charles should have the last laugh.Needless to say this is a stupid movie that makes you laugh and jump in parts. Most part of the movie is shot in hand held live camera as Reality TV. Borat is a character coming from Kazakhstan to learn the culture of America. It is crudely made film. Most of the times  it shocks the audiences and people. How on earth someone can think of such a movie  or such things to be included in a movie.Some takes on America are very intelligent. Good part of the movie is that it is not preachy or does not pass judgments. Borat just asks stupid questions  basic questions  and questions everything with his bare tone. Some incidents are unimaginably nauseating. Some dialogues are un-listenable to sober words. The movie is made to shock you and it successfully does that.Not a great movie, but something to see  if you want to see a really DIFFERENT movie - just to check the technique of one can make such movies too  this is a movie to go and pay a visit.",5,2,5,7 January 2007
The Incredible Hulk," Incredible Hunk
","I knew that this movie would be on the same lines of Iron Man, Spider man etc. with the latest hi-tech visual effects; just for the change of having one more hero on the big screen doing incredible things, I went to see Incredible Hunk.Dr.Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is experimented on plasma cells by US defence to develop super - HERO soldier out of humans; things go wrong  and Bruce becomes an incredible huge monster and escapes the lab. The experiment leaves a pattern to Bruce's behavior  that whenever he gets angry he turns to an incredible hulk. The US defence is out to get him back. Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) is so fascinated while seeing, facing and fighting the Incredible Hulk  that he wants to be one. The result is - he becomes a Monster Hulk, and in the end, Incredible Hulk fights the monster Hulk to save New York City. Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) plays the love angel of Bruce.There is not much to the movie except the incredible action sequences and fights. They are a treat to enjoy on big screen. Edward Norton is okay, Tim Roth is better as a villain and Liv Tyler  whenever she comes on the screen  distracts the attention by her big upper lip. I had mentioned in my earlier review that she might have done plastic surgery or botox; there are many who think that way  but we do not know for sure; and would not be interested to know. The fact is that whatever her acting  her lips are a hindrance to her acting skills  if she has any. Coming back to movie This is Director Louis Leterrier third movie after Transporter 2. He has done good job to raise the bar from a B-grade movie to at least an A-grade look. The cinematography of Brazil Rio de Janeiro is breath-taking and wonderful.Overall it is a good and better adaptation of the comic novel and previous film. With possibility of Iron Man joining hands with Incredible Hulk  we would wait for that movie next time.Go and see it if you are an action movie or Super-human type of the movie addict. You will enjoy it.(Stars 6.0 out of 10)",6,2,5,21 June 2008
3:10 to Yuma," 3:10 to Yuma
","I knew that this movie was a remake of 1957 classic western movie. I normally do not like re-makes because they are never well made or come anywhere near the patch of the original. But this being a western  I love western movies  and that too released after so long, I was much more than excited to venture out to see this one.Ben Wade (Russel Crowe) is an outlaw - robs money and kills people. He is brutal, but this complex character has also some humane side to him. He has his gang with his deputy as Charlie Prince (Ben Foster). They rob cattle from a ranch of Dan Evans (Christian Bale). Dan goes after Ben to get his cattle back and in process becomes ends up in getting Ben arrested. Their tasks is to put Ben on the train at 3:10 pm to Yuma  where he would be hanged. How they take Ben there becomes the remainder of the story.I liked the moral twist the story brings at the end where Ben helps Dan to take him till the train, so that he can set an example to his son  that his Dad did not take bribe nor he was afraid of the outlaws.All characterization of the movie was absorbing - especially of Ben Wade, and his relationship with Dan Evans; they share a complex form of understanding. Both of the two main protagonist Russel Crowe and Christian Bale have done equal justice to the role  beautifully portrayed. Ben Foster as the deputy was intense and a pleasure to watch.The cinematography of any western movie landscape is mindblowing and so was for this movie. The ruggedness, the dirt, the soil, the horses  I just loved all of it. A treat to watch such movies on a big screen.Director James Mangold did a fantastic job in making this remake. As I have not seen the original I don't have any words to compare with. But this movie is technically excellent and has a larger time space of 122 minutes (compared to 92 minutes of the original)  so that is nice.One observation  why should anyone try to protect an outlaw and take so much pain to take him to a train station; in the process  let soooo many people die and killed anyways the outlaw is going to be hanged. Very stupid and silly  I say of those people and director.But, I overlook this stupidity, otherwise there is no story, no adventure, no action and no pleasure given to audiences to watch two excellent actors in the backdrop of a western setting  on a BIG screen.I thought of writing this review after I saw the original too, but later changed my mind. I will see the original later and write my comparative review covering both the movies  sometime later.(Stars 7.25 out of 10)",7,0,1,23 September 2008
Marie Antoinette," Marie Antoinette
","Marie Antoinette Marie Antoinette is a true story of an Austrian princess married to a French prince, and Marie's growth from a young innocent girl to one who observes the new royal family cultural with curiosity and fun. How internal politics surrounding her evolves and changes her personality and brings her to grief, happiness and love comprise the rest of the story.The venture is different and unusual.The story line of Marie Antoinette  played very well by Kirsten Dunst - had the scope to be presented more dramatically, but the director Sofia Coppola is more interested to show the aesthetic side of royal life  by a series of photographic gourmet of dishes, dresses, and design etc. that she looses the purpose of telling an engrossing tale in movie's format. What it results in the audience is only intermittent level of interests with loads of boredom through catalogue photographic images of designs. People with a great aesthetical sense would love this movie and bear the breaks in story line. The musical score is contemporary and for me did not suit the mood and senses of 15th century Europe. But that is Director's prerogative to be courageous and at times outrageous in deciding to choose what they want to show their audiences.I liked the casting of the movie that matched the characterization. Most of the actors have performed well.(Stars 3.5 out of 10)",4,0,0,9 March 2007
Deja Vu," Deja Vu
","I went to see this movie being pretty aware of the fact that the movie would be a typical Hollywood action movie and was not expecting much more from it. I had seen the trailers and it looked very much of what I had intended the movie to be.The story is about a cop trying to stop a (patriotic) terrorist who wants to blow a US navy ferry with a stolen vehicle full of bombs. The movie starts with the ferry being blown off by the terrorist  so where is the story line gone? But wait  the frames unfold to a new dimension where our hero can travel back by 4 days into time and stop the terrorist to blow up the ferry, and in turn save our heroine and lots of dead people. Is this all possible in real life? NO would be the answer  but scientific movies like ET, Star Wars etc. are big hits on the fantasy of 'What if'? The movie is sleek. Denzel Washington is stylish sometimes overly with his facial expressions; and Val Kilmer  has evidently put on lots of weight from his usual self, but is good in his small role.The movie is able to maintain your interest till the last frame. There are good action scenes  especially the car chase of terrorist through time difference  where with one eye Denzel is able to see the present day and the other eye he is able to see the same road 4 days back  this chase is thrilling.Especially at the end of the movie, the way Denzel is shown traveling from one place to another within the city  seems that the city is very small  which is not the case of New Orleans as a city. It is big!! Director should have taken more care of this fact.",5,3,5,7 January 2007
Hereditary," Conceived / pitched as a family drama - but shot as HORROR
","I had heard good critics reviews of this film. Later it was recommended by my friend, thus I had to watch it.I am an ardent fan of Toni Collette since the Sixth Sense and Little Miss Sunshine days (both movies I have seen more than 6 times).Miniature specialist Anne Graham (Toni Collette) lives with her husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne), son Peter (Alex Wolff), and daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro). When Anne's mother dies, Anne confesses her frightful relationship with her mother at the funeral eulogy and mental illness running in her family at the counseling support group.. In a freak car accident when Charlie's head is decapitated while Peter is driving, strange events unfolds. Anne is helped by Joan (Ann Dowd) a member of counseling group to communicate with Charlie through sÃ©ance. More ghostly events occur resulting in the finale where the whole family dies to join as coven members headed by Paimon spirit.The screenplay writer director Ari Aster after giving a short film The Strange thing about the Johnsons in 2011; directs his first feature length film debut terming the movie as tragedy turning to a nightmare rather than a horror movie; shot the movie on a set stage (and outdoors set of the house) in just 32 days.Most of the script is well connected and aptly executed. But Aster falters in the final run. A movie that had all the potential to become a master-piece like Omen or Shining, fails in the end.But taking that aside, and few other nit-picks (why one did / did not do this?) here and there, the movie is good. It grips the audiences throughout with punctuated props as each relating events unfolds. Nothing seems to be out of place. Toni Collette (who liked the script so much that accepted the film even though she did not want to do dark, heavy movies) and Alex Wolff (HairBrained and Coming through the Rye fame) act brilliantly and both may deserve award nominations. The setting, cinematography (Pawel Pogorzelski) and music play their role to enhance the eerie atmosphere. With the budget of USD 10 million , it has already earned more than USD 80 million as a box-office success with critical appreciation. A good addition to the horror genre.

Casablanca," Casablanca
","Here is looking at you kid, these words are written by my current boss Bernhard Drumel in his skype. I never knew that they are from Casablanca, until I saw the movie.This is a love story during the world war second based in Casablanca, Morocco, North West Africa  a port where refugee Europeans came to depart for USA. Old time lovers - Rick (Humphrey Bogart) and Lisa (Ingrid Bergman), meet after many years in Casablanca and remember their love in France. Lisa was and is wife of Victor (Paul Henreid) and the couple is planning to run away to America through Casablanca. Rick - now the owner of the most popular club in Casablanca is well connected among corrupt military and government machinery - sacrifices his love and helps the couple duo to go to America.It is the not the story in itself, but the way it is told that makes it a very interesting viewing. The pace is fast and engrossing. The story slowly unfolds and never lets the viewers guess the next till the very end. There is a sense of mystery and suspense. The backbone of the movie is a love story that has gone wrong. It connects with every audience. The misery and cynicism of Rick is so real that every man may feel a close resemblance to the feeling Rick is having. Though many, there are well itched characters that define the intent and purpose of their words and actions. The characters  mostly representing different European countries  and give an universal appeal to western audiences, and so I understand its relevance in people's mind and popularity.The character of Rick is brilliantly played by the chain smoking king Bogart. This was my first movie of Bogart and he impressed me the most. Like all olden days actors who  each one of them  had their unique style and so delight to watch; Bogart has his own. Ingrid looks and acts beautifully to say and hide her secrets with her eyes and body language. Paul Henreid was good, but not brilliant. Special mention of the local French Captain Renault, played by Claude Rains  who plays the most engrossing characters with black and white, shrewd and sober shades  a delight to watch him.Each and every dialogue of the movie is perfect and catchy. The lines are worth repeating even today and written with so conviction that they are ever-green. The one that I personally liked the most was when the German commander asks Rick which nationality he belongs to; and Rick with his usual cynicism replies  I am a drunkard. There are so many such quotable lines almost unforgettable in the movie.This was Director Martin Curtiz's 132 movie production as director. It took him almost 20 years of making movie to come out with this gem. Martin kept on making movies till the last year 1961; he died in 1962. Great music, fantastic choreography of people, and definite acting by most crew! The only thing I disliked about the movie was that most of it was shot indoors on the sets, and that in itself did not give the movie the epic proportions that normally one would expect from such classics.There are many hate reviews about this movie, and I read a few of them. I found this movie to be very good  made in 1942, it was much ahead of its time in terms of scripting, dialogue, pace and screenplay. Now a days we see so many movies  but to think of the rave Casablanca would have created during world war second times, would have been enormous.My salute to Martin Curtiz and Humphrey Bogart! Now I know and understand what does my boss mean when he writes and says  Here is looking at you kid! (Stars 8 out of 10)",8,5,8,28 July 2007
In Bruges," In Bruges
","It was six months back when I went to Bruge and it fascinated me by its beauty  lovely place. On BBC, when I saw the discussion of this new movie  In Bruges, I found it interesting. I saw the trailers, and that too appealed me  as is based on an interesting premise. Two hit men  elderly Ken (Brendan Gleeson) and young Ray (Collin Farrell)  are ordered to hide in Bruges by their Boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes), because Ray along with a priest, by mistake killed a young boy  and other gangs are behind them to seek revenge. The only way the thing can be resolved is to kill Ray. Harry asks Ken to kill Ray, who is suicidally depressed. Ken wants to give Ray another chance. Harry gets angry and comes to Bruges. The final show-down results in lots of gun-shots, blood and death of most of the protagonist.This is a dark comedy thriller movie. Writer-Director Martin McDonagh, who had won an Oscar for a short film  Six Shooter in 2004, comes back with this wonderful movie. He has this uncanny style of narrative- where he infuses dark comedy and racism slurs  with penache. And the style is felt in every frame of this movie. Even in the darkest and grimmest scene  Martin manages to keep audience gay  with the dialogue and style. The writing / story / screenplay are the kings, and Martin takes out brilliant performances from his perfecting casting.Brendan as Key, masterly enacts this role of loyal hit-man and a compassionate friend. Collin Farrel is just outstanding in his role of this innocent, eccentric, dry humored & silly guy  who is also a cold blooded murderer, with a conscious. Ralph Fiennes  since Shakespeare in Love, has grown in stature and maturity in his characterization of roles.The musical score is Carter Burwell and cinematography of Bruges by Eigil Bryld are excellent.There are also other characters in the film, who are real to the groove and have given top class performances.Though comparable with Tarantino dark humor and style, I think Martin has his own genre of telling the story. I hope he continues giving us such lovely and enjoyable gems.Those audience, who do not like talkative movies or movies that show blood in cold shots  stay away from it. Others, go and enjoy this wonderful flick.Just a trivia, I went to see this movie with my work colleague Claudia Misch, and met other two colleagues - Lena and Guido. All four sat together and enjoyed seeing this movie.(Stars 7.25 out of 10)",7,1,3,19 July 2008
Chinatown," Chinatown
","Roman Polanski  I know he is a great director, but I have only seen a couple of his films, and thus wanted to see this, which is rated highly by many critics.Chinatown is a story of a private detective Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) who is dupely involved in a case of wife Evelyn Cross (Faye Dunaway) cheating, that leads to his investigating a murder and exposing the bitter truth of today's politics, land grabbing and greed of money  by people who are rich like Noah Cross (John Huston)  father or Evelyn Cross. There is a mysterious turn of events with a parallel story and sub-plot around the murder involving affairs and relationship.Roman Polanski has done a marvelous job. He controls the director's medium. There are not many notes in the movie that I would consider as off-note, except a few  the most striking the love scene between the detective Jake and the lead lady Evelyn. But apart from that the movie is fabulous. It has an excellent story and screenplay written by Robert Towne.Jack Nicholson is great in his skills and does give a confidence, style, insightful, and daring image of Jake Gittes. So has Fane Dunaway as daughter, wife and mother and John Huston as rich, wealthy, mean and corrupt father have done marvelous jobs.The musical score of the movie is punctuated at finer parts of the film bringing more mystery and drama in the narrative. I loved the camera angles  and it reminded so much of Akira Kurosawa's canvass  that covers all background with aesthetic placement of characters forming a pleasing painting on the screen. Roman has a very keen eye on every department of the movie and that fact comes out loud and clear.The sad ending is a typical Roman's touch to his trademark films.I loved it and would highly recommend to others to see it at least once.(Stars 8 out of 10)",8,0,1,25 August 2007
Fight Club," Fight Club
","Fight Club I was recommended about this 1999 movie by my office colleague Bill Piccolo. It sounded like a typical boxing ring movie to me  but due to the eagerness of suggestion, I thought of viewing it right away on the borrowed DVD.This is a shocker of a movie! You could hate it or love it. My thoughts were shifting on the scales from one extreme to the other  what is going on? What is the purpose of the movie? What is the message of the movie? What does it want to convey? I had to sleep over the movie before I sat down to write this review.The movie is about the main protagonist guy  Edward Norton playing an insomniac, who comes in touch with first with Marla Singer  played by Helena Carter  and later on with the dynamo of a guy - Tyler Durden  played brilliantly by Brad Pitt in his bigger than screen performance. From that time  the movie takes a roller coaster ride to unbelievable incidences, situations and thought processes that churn the mind out of the viewers. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton set up a 'fight club' that grows into many cities around US and becomes an underground mayhem causing outfit. There is a final twist  like all the classic movies have; that builds up the scope for me to view it again and again! I think that this is a fantastic movie. Not by the sense of acceptance of what is going on in the movie  but the narration of a concept that is so weird. I like movies because it takes one to those areas of human beings that are not dwelled in before. Many attempts are made to showcase a dark side of human nature  not many are successful in doing that. But the director David Fincher  (Alien 3, Se7en, Game and Panic Room) has created a dynamo of this movie. Hats off to this brilliant young director! A lot of effort must have gone in preparing for this cult movie. Small details that are obviously missed during the first viewing would be revealed after 2-3 viewing  once you know the ending.Edward Norton has played his role to perfection (I had seen him recently in The Illusionist and found him stone faced), Brad Pitt takes the guts out of you and his larger than life persona would be remembered for many years and accomplished actress Helena Carter plays her role with mysterious oomph and style  great trio on work.The best part of the movie  if you miss it during the first viewing is its background sound track. Please pay special attention to it  it carries several messages of the final twists embedded into the sound track.It is a male dominated movie but the other sex who love different and new cinema would also love it. I would surely highly recommend to all movie-buffs friends.Jut a trivia  this movie is rated number 31 in all time classic lists of 250. Does not that say a lot about the movie?

Memento," Memento
","In India, one of the top Bollywood super stars Khan  Amir Khan is making a movie. We hear that he is very choosy, selective and does lots of discussion with the Director of the movie before saying YES. So when he said yes to act in a movie everyone got interested and we knew that he is re-making a Tamil version of a movie called Ghajini in Hindi for national release. While reading the story of Ghajini, I remembered that this story is something I have seen. I thought for a while and realized that during one of my International flights I saw a movie (and felt asleep half way) with same story line. So researching on the web  I found that the story on which Ghajini is made is Memento. That is when I decided to give Memento another shot, determined not to sleep this time during the viewing.The story is about a man Leonard (Guy Pearce) whose wife (Jorja Fox) is killed and due to the fight with the killer Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), Leonard looses his short term memory. Leonard remembers every event till his wife was alive, but after that his memory captures only events for 12 seconds maximum. To remember that he has to take revenge for his wife's murder  he has tattooed all over his body the events and facts, and he keeps taking photographs and writes lots of paper notes to remember what he has to do, where he has go etc. That is the way Leonard takes the revenge and kills his wife's killer.It is a typical revenge story. What makes people interested are two things  the concept of 12 seconds memory thrown in and the story is told backwards by the Director Christopher Nolao; meaning the movie starts with the killing of the murderer, and it goes backwards to the scene when wife was killed. This I think is the unique selling point of the movie.The Director must have really spent a huge amount of time and energy in scripting this unique concept. Why one should say the story backwards is a question I still am not able to figure out. For what purpose and sake  just for experimentation, just to show that yes a story can be told in this fashion too? I suppose YES. Earlier we have seen many movies of the same genre where the episodes are juggled and presented to the audience, and only through the last episode the real mystery is uncovered. But does Director Christopher succeed in this experiment? Yes  in getting audience interested in the concept, and yes in getting nominated for Oscars for best scripts and editing.As I told earlier  during the first viewing I fell asleep, because I could not make head or tail of this movie. My second viewing, I forced myself to see it through the 113 minutes. I saw it. As the movie is presented in reverse, I viewed the movie twice in reverse to get hold of the story better. I must have spent about 250 minutes viewing this movie again and again from all possible ways. My verdict is the movie is badly made because: The director even though experiments with a new concept, but fails to hold interest of the audience. All the actors have acted with stoned faced expressions. The love scenes between Guy Pearce and Carrie Anne Moss (another woman Natalie  who helps him) are too irritating, distracting, clichéd and unnecessary for the flow of the movie. The direction  apart from the reverse presentation is very poor.The biggest flaw is that it thinks that the audience is stupid and fool. I could not understand when this hero is not able to remember anything more than 12 seconds how come he figures out that he has kept the notes and photographs in his pockets? Every time he pulls them out  how his memory works then? The story seems to be said lasting two days in total, during which time  he solves the mystery and kills the murderer. What happened between the accident and that two days? How many days have gone by? I saw the movie backwards too. The precision with which he solves the mystery and leads up to the killer is so simple and like child's play  one thing leading to another. The director says that the police don't believe in the hero analysis and thus have not helped him. The efficiency and confidence with which the hero analyzes and corrects his notes is laughable. How he knows what he wrote earlier was false, just because someone has just said the opposite? Could be the person who just gave him the facts  must be telling lies. No questions asked  just a big gimmick by the Director Christopher  who wants to prove a point that he too can make an intelligent movie.But according to me he has failed miserably. I would like to give this movie a zero rating out of 10 just to bring it out of the number 28 slot on IMDb database, but because of this unique concept and attempt I have to give him (Stars 3 out of 10)",3,3,6,24 June 2007
12 Angry Men," 12 Angry Men
","One of the all time classics! The story is about 12 jury members in a room for about 90 minutes (real time) to decide the open and shut case of a young boy of 18 years killing his father. There are 11 votes confirming guilty and 1 for not-guilty. The whole movie is about how the 12 votes finally reach 11 confirming non-guilty and 1 for guilty, until the last one too gives in to an anonymous verdict that the boy is not guilty of his father's murder.The movie was delicately presented. As audience we find that the case that was to be fought in the court-room was fought among the jurors. Each and every juror was aware of all the facts of the case and everyone was on the same page, except one  Juror no. 8 (Henry Ford). The movie explores the value of one life on looking minutely at the known events and unfolding them in better light for audience to understand and know that what seems truth often is not  if you look closely at it.The movie is shot in a single room that is hot, humid and sweaty  and halfway through it starts raining outside. The enigma of the 12 jurors, the ding-dong dallying between guilty and not-guilty, the peeling of the case layer by layer with new discussions crossing personal experiences and relation to the case was fascinating to watch.Henry Ford acts with such anxiousness that you are bitten by his conviction of not-guilty the moment he speaks his doubts by saying  I do not know, I am not sure. That starts the mastery roller-coaster to a finale that is hard to take the eyes off.The Director Sidney Lumet does a fantastic job in I think (most probably) converting this stage drama into big screen canvass with eminent 12 actors. All of them have acted poignantly well in their well written characters and mannerisms. One can see their upbringings while they talk and that is marvelous.Wonderful movie, normally I hesitate to give movies more than 8 stars, but for this I will give (Stars 8.25 out of 10)",8,1,1,28 July 2007
Black Book," The Black Book
","This movie is running in Amsterdam from last 16 weeks and it had to be on my list of movies. It is a multi-lingual movie with Dutch, German and English dialogues used  the common link is the Dutch sub-title. The movie is made by Dutch director with mostly Dutch cast.The story is said to be based on true events. The movie is about a Jewish girl staying in Netherlands during the Second World War  when the Germans attack and occupy Netherlands. The girl's home is bombarded and most of her friends and relatives killed by Germans. The story is about her survival and the help she provides to the anti-Nazi militia force to fight the Germans  by secretly working in a German's army base.The movie is well made. The main protagonist  the girl  Carice van Houten has done an excellent job. This movie seems a big break for Carice, and she would surely be a forerunner in winning best actress awards  at least in European region. Like all the WWII movies some events shown are quite disturbing and nauseating. There are explicit sex scenes shown to depict how a girl can survive by using her beauty and body and being smart. The movie also shows the type of corruption that went on within the Dutch society during WWII, were some people assembled treasures from deceased Jews family.It is a long movie that satisfies you totally with the width of events that it provides like an epic. It also presents the movie in a commercial format  with all spices added at appropriate points to keep the interest alive and kicking throughout the movie. At the end of the movie you as audience feel happy. For me it was difficult to understand the dialogues, but I felt happy seeing the movie. I can imagine how happy and proud Dutch people would feel by seeing such a well made Dutch movie.",7,11,16,7 January 2007
Hot Fuzz," Hot Fuzz - Sorry I didn't get the black humor!
","Hot Fuzz Sometimes it happens that you don't get it; and this was the movie for me. I didn't get it. There are bad Hollywood movies, there are bad Bollywood movies and this was a bad British movie! The story is about a brilliant London cop Nicholos Angel (Simon Pegg)  who is so good that the whole police force wants him to be transferred to a small town called Sandford, where the action, crime, comedy, emotions, and all the senseless stuff begins. There are series of murders in the town and Simon Pegg with the help of fellow cop played by Martin Freeman exposes Timothy Dalton (James Bond fame) and others.The movie is so stupid and idiotic that it blew over my sense of humor too. I didn't get it.A few credible things about the movie was that in the name of comedy it was taking a joke on the movie and its star, the background score was jelling well with the tone of the movie and the editing was slick.But the team of young Director Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg has not succeeded for the second time; their first attempt was also another horrid movie - Shaun of the Dead.The whole theatre was outrageously laughing and I felt that I was on a different planet. Such things have happened too often to me viewing crude Indian comedies. Sorry I do not get this humor! (Stars 1.5 out of 10)",2,9,30,20 April 2007
Juno," Juno
","Juno I read many good reviews on IMDb about this movie, and it while I write this review it is currently rated at no. 148  best movie list.The story is about a 16 year old girl Juno (played by 20 year old Ellen Page) who finds that she is pregnant by a simpler and ordinary guy, Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera). She decides for abortion  but finding that the baby in the womb might have grown nails  decides to mother the baby. She concludes that she will find a suitable rich, good and lovely couple to rear her child  she finds one in Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) and Mark (Jason Bateman). Juno delivers the baby  but in doing so, gets in touch with some basic truths of life and love.This movie is a big hit among young girls. The theatre I sat in to see this movie, 80 percent of the audience was below 18 years girls. (I was surely surprised and shy) The movie has also won the Oscars for best original screenplay writing  the award goes to Diablo Cody. A lot of the credit for what the movie has turned out to be should go to three persons  one Diablo Cody, second the director Jason Reitman (Thank you for smoking) and third the actress Ellen Page (who is acting since she is 10 years old).Diablo Cody  a media graduate, turned secretary, stripper, blog / storywriter turned screenwriter is an inspirational life to read. She creates this character Juno  smart and over confidence beyond her age, and delivers dialogues that are not heard routinely. There are so many sequences in the movie that are so unreal but is not the fictional movie industry a fantasy? Jason Reitman  sticks to the simplier task of pure screenplay adaptation. Ellen Page  portrays a difficult character, that is difficult to perceive  let alone play it. A 16 year old girl talking the language of a lady who is older than 26-27 years of age.I think, the trigger of connect with this movie could be a whipped up psyche of gender equality hungry audiences who gets a straw to hang on with this bold persona.Apart from that, the best part of the movie is the musical score by Matt Messina  it so touchy.The relationship between the couple Vanessa and Mark (looking to adopt a baby) is so deceptively written  always ahead of what the audiences think  that it is really entertaining and intelligent.The last 20 minutes of the movie are the most engrossing and best. The vivid superficiality until that point converts to a deeply touching wind-up.I have never come across such careless, dis-respectful and arrogant character and it surely is difficult to accept.The sad part of gender equality - especially relating to women - is that the trend of futuristic women are shown having all the bad behavior, bad characteristic, bad thoughts and bad actions of men - ie abusive, aggressive, over-confident etc. Now a days people think that this is good and intelligent thing, but I am not sure!?

Spider-Man 3," Spider Man 3
","This Spider Man is a bit too long, bigger than before and from my point of view a bit better.There are four plots carried forward from Spider Man II  mainly his girl friend Mary Jane Watson; his friend turned enemy Osborn Junior, his grand mother and lastly his job / boss. There are a few more sub-plots  an alien black organism transforming Spider Man and later his competitive reporter to evil ones, and lastly the Sand Man. So in this movie as you must have noticed there are three enemies that Spider Man has to fight  Sand Man, Osborn Junior and the alien. With love story, action, drama and emotions - in the end Spider Man triumphs and I liked the movie just for its total entertainment value.The Director Sam Raimi has himself taken a shot at co-writing the screenplay with his elder brother Ivan Raimi. I think Sam has handled the complicated story line in a very sophisticated way on screen. He has given ample time and scope for each character to develop. The under-lying emotion in the script is obviously the love-story of Spider Man. The friendly neighborhood Spider Man is vulnerable, funny, humane, emotional and lovable when he is Peter Parker. There are good sequences of actions spread across the whole movie from time to time. With the number of enemies growing  we become eager to watch the ending on how Spider Man will fight all of them. This Spider Man also dances and grooves like John Travolta on the street showing his mean side.Toby Maguire excels in his role and it would be difficult to image any other face than him as Spider Man. Kristen Dust, James Franco, Thomas Hayden (as Sand Man) have played their part with director's cut.If you ask me what is not there in the movie  I have to think a hundred times to answer that question. Everything is there. The movie has all the entertainment cliché  but I never expected more than that from a Spider Man movie.I was happy to see for the first time - young, old, boys, girls, man and woman people  a whole range of mixed crowd enjoying the movie. Being a spectator I too enjoyed it. Take a huge bag of pop-corn, bottle of cola and chill out with die hard Spider Man fans  I think you will enjoy it more than me.(Stars 7 out of 10)",7,3,4,5 May 2007
Zodiac," Zodiac
","I knew this movie was directed by David Fincher (Fight Club, Panic Room, Seven, Game, Alien), and that makes it irresistible for movie lovers like me. But I always read HATE reviews on IMDb before I go to see the movie, so that I would be more critical in my outlook and look at the movie in a more balanced way. This time too I read the utterly bad reviews of Zodiac, and with cross fingers entered the hall.The story is simple, based on true events, spans from 1963 - 1970 multiple murders by a person named Zodiac in Northern California. The case remains open, unsolved till date; with the closest suspect Arthur Leigh Allen dead in 1992, it only remains (and will always remain) a speculation of sorts  who the real Zodiac Killer was.Zodiac is one of the very popular American subject since 1960s - 9 movies, 5 TV serials, 4 graphic novels, 6 novels and numerous magazine articles  showcases this. Everyone knows the story. It has been told in so many types, ways and fashion  that the only interesting point as a spectator is to see how David Fincher tells the story differently. As all of you can imagine, the task was uphill from the very beginning, include the personal baggage of his good movies that he needs to prove his worth. I say, too much of a burden on David's shoulder.David Fincher could have taken a narrative style very functional to the commercial format, which has already been used time and again  serial killers  till we are bored to death seeing those movies. But David Fincher uses a totally classical style of directing this thriller. He takes his time (148 minutes in total), he keeps the storyline simple and straight forward (no flashbacks), he uses the novelistic style of narrative  that slowly unfolds and engages you; he uses not a big star-cast to blow the script and screenplay off its ground.I not only enjoyed the movie but loved it too. Fantastic is my verdict. One more feather on David's cap. There are several characters and actors (Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, Anthony Edwards, Robert Downey, John Carroll etc.), but I won't spend time writing about any of them, because the movie solely belongs to David  the director's medium! Those who have written poor and hated reviews were expecting a Dirty Harry (one of the foremost Zodiac adaptation) style; or a Fight Club  and surely they are disappointed. I only say that their minds are one dimensional and David Fincher has risen above fan club's earthly expectations to do something daringly different and he succeeds in it.Hats off to David Fincher! Looking forward to seeing his next venture - The Curious case of Benjamin Button; where he comes with a huge star cast  Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett.(Stars 8 out of 10)",8,2,3,11 June 2007
The Prestige," The Prestige
","The Prestige Prestige is about rivalry between two young magicians, who turn from friend to foe due to a mistake in which the lover of one magician is killed. This results in both the magician trying to out-play each other in each and every magic trick they perform, leading in the end to one magician being killed by the other. The story is about the twist and turns, flash-backs and magic-tricks. The plot is set up in early 20th century London. The direction is good. By the time the movie is little bit more than half  way over, you will realize the possibility of the mystery that the director is trying to evade your eyes. Than the remaining movie you will watch just to see whether the director brings a new turn to the story, and does it not match your sense of analysis. To mine it matched  but the movie is a bit beyond our knowing director's mystery. There are many twists and turns to confuse the viewers, may be the director expected the viewer to have a second go at the movie to properly understand and put the zig-saw puzzle in order. Would I venture for another viewing to better understand what happened in the movie? No, I would not.Both the lead actors  Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale  play their role with conviction. Michael Caine as an adviser to Hugh Jackman also fits well in that character's role. There are two heroines  Piper Perabo - playing wife of Christian, and Scarlett Johansson  playing assistant and mistress for both magician from time to time.Is there a thrill in the movie? A Bit. Is there a mystery in the movie? A forced mystery  the director after taking so many twists and turn in the script could had the freedom to end the movie any which way he was happy with. Every or any ending in this movie would be a mystery.(5 Stars out of 10)",5,3,6,18 February 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," Pan's Labyrinth
","This is a Spanish movie, and I saw it in Dutch subtitles. I do not know both the languages. I had seen the trailer of the movie and found it too childish and weird in associating war scenes with fantasy. I was not much interested in seeing the movie, but just because of the excellent review of the film on various web-sites, I went and saw the movie.The story is told from the viewpoint of a 12 year old girl Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), who is brought by her mother (Manolo Solo) to the step father and Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez) of Spanish battalion during the fascist 1944 era. There are two plots running in the movie. One of the brutal guerilla wars of cruel Captain Vidal and the other of the fantasy and dream world of Ofelia, who finds and sees a fairy tale beyond human imaginations. The story unfolds side by side and ends up in how the young girl succeeds in her mission, with the help of a fantasy Jinn (Doug Jones), through the defeat and killing of the sadistic Captain Vidal.The Director Guillermo del Toro has told this tale with sheer brilliance in weaving the two story line with such a ease and simplicity that neither of them disturb the flow and narrative of the movie. The brutality of the war and the terrifying images of the fantasy world  both live up to the expectations and audience's satisfaction.The musical score is excellent and the production, casting, set, make up designers have played a pivotal role in the movie's high quality output. All credit to Guillermo, who has achieved international fame and reputation through this movie  that has won many awards (among them 3 Oscars).Sergi Lopez has played the hated role of Captain Vidal and leaves us in resounding hatred towards him. But the movie is all and all dependent on the girl Ivana Baquero who has grabbed the impossible opportunity of the life time to play this innocent yet vulnerable role of the young girl who loves to dream and live a fantasy life.A unique and totally satisfying movie experience; Go see and cherish the joys of good cinema. A mild warming  the movie has many gory and violent scenes that might disturb you too.(Stars 8 out of 10)",8,2,5,10 June 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Sweeney Todd
","Sweeney Todd I knew this was a musical. I saw in the trailers  that it was dark, and bloody; a different genre of film production! Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) convicts the barber Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) on false charges, rapes Benjamin's wives and destroys a wonderful happy family. Benjamin barker returns from exile after many years, adapts a new name and looks - Sweeney Todd; sets up a new barber shop along with a weirdo baker Mrs.Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter). There is a sub-plot in where a young boy Anthony Hope (Jamie Campbell Bower) falls in love with the Benjamin's daughter Johanna (Jayne Wisener) who is adopted by Judge Turpin. Sweeney Todd starts his gory revenge saga by cutting the throats of all the culprits involved in destroying his life and family. There is a tragic end to the tale  which I won't disclose here, to keep the spoilers away.The attempt by director Tim Burton is excellent. He presents the Broadway hit on screen in musical  a dark, bloodied and gory revenge saga is really an attempt. I read that this project idea was cooking since last 25 years with great actors in mind to play the lead. Luckily Johnny Depp got the onus.Johnny Depp acts brilliantly as the demon barber and it is difficult to imagine anybody else could have played the character with much more better conviction that Johnny Depp. He is outstanding in each scene. The other acting that stands out is again the mean portrayal of corrupt judge by Alan Rickman. He has matured into a seasoned medieval evil and looks convincing.The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is intentionally dark and with blue tinge. It creates the atmosphere of loathe and disgust and letting the minds live in those dark ages. Especially the beginning 15 minutes  is intentionally darker in contrast, then the rest.Stephen Sondheim provides the original musical score of Broadway. It is excellent.For those with  weak stomach for blood and gory; and with weak likings of musicals  this is not their cup of tea.Overall, this is a good attempt to capture and present the world of cinema  something different, a dark, bloody musical!

Malcolm X," Malcolm X
","I being from India had heard of a revolutionary person called Malcolm X from US, who was shot dead at a young age, but did not know much about it. So when Malcolm X was referred to by African staying in UK as one of the most influential thinker, I thought let me see this movie.The movie is based on the 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X' co-written by Alex Haley and published in 1966 one year after Malcolm X's murder. Denzel Washington plays Malcolm X.The movie narrates the story of a kid Malcolm, as a bright student who is not allowed to study further due to people's prejudice towards black. As a youth Malcolm leads a smoke, drug, alcohol, sex and burglary life that lands him in prison. In prison, he is influenced by a man named Bimbi, and the teachings of Islam through a prophet Elijah Muhammad. Malcolm studies and graduates from prison and joins Nation of Islam organisation of Elijah Muhammad. Here he takes the causes of African people, preachers and gives speeches against the atrocities of white people. He demands the right of African people who are here in American by default and not their own will. His daring outspokenness makes him popular among Africans and controvesial figure, but this also isolates him from everyone. He is thrown out of Nation of Islam and after a pilgrimage to Mecca his outlook changes a little bit and he starts his own organisation Muslim Mosque Inc. Within a few months he is shot dead.This is a very good movie to understand who was Malcolm X? If someone does not want to read his life story and get incite in 3 hours. Hats off and kudos to Spike Lee, who undertook this daring project of great scale and magnitude, when he was only 35 years of age. No doubt that Spike Lee is considered one the best directors of Hollywood. Denzel Washington is so authentic in the role of Malcolm X, that it is hard to believe anyone else in that role. He lives the role to its cells. There is also an uncanny resemblance of Denzel with Malcolm X. Brilliant! It is so sad that Denzel did not win an Oscar that year  may be a reality check on his being black!!? One gets a very good idea of Malcolm X through this movie. He was a confused person, and one gets an impression that as lots of lost minds, he too got a hook in to cling on. Like Christianity, Judiasm, Hinduism, Nationalism etc. Malcolm also found his hook called Islam. Many things he spoke were so true and he dared to speak it out loud and clear. The only problem was he became mis-represented because he was wearing a garb of Black Muslim in American society.The build up to the movie is slow and it takes nearly 1 hour for the movie to actually take hold of one's attention. The editing could have had been more tight. The most diluting part of the movie was its ending where Spike tried to normalize his life to a caricature black leader. Spike showed a street named Malcolm X, he made Nelson Mandela speak for Malcolm X, he made small children rant  'I am Malcolm X' and it was so sorry and laughable to see that at the end of such a wonderful and dramatic life story.I think there was no need to explain or justify Malcolm X, the presentation of his life's story was in itself enough. That's all  nothing more. Like any other leader we see  Malcolm X was also a great confused leader.(Stars 7.5 out of 10)",8,3,9,24 March 2008
Chak de! India," Chak De India
","Any Shah Rukh Khan movie creates a general interest in movie-goer crazy public of India, so with Chak De India releasing during the Independence day week with Shah Rukh playing the lead surely was a big draw for the crowds in India.The story is about Kabir Khan (Shah Rukh Khan) who faces humiliation after unable to score a penalty goal in a World Cup Final match against Pakistan and comes back after 7 years to coach the India Girls' Hockey Team that has good players from 16 Indian states  but the team is fragmented with Regional biases, language difference, player egos, senior and juniors, north and south, rich and poor etc. On top of that nobody has any expectations from the Indian Girls' Hockey Team. From a side that is considered down and out from the beginning, Kabir Khan  takes it as his personal challenge to take that team to the World Cup Final and win the match against Australia.Director Shimit Amin (Ab Tak Chappan) joins hands with Yash-Raj Productions to deliver this patriotic movie on the down and under team and sports. I think he has done a very good job in making the movie.Shah Rukh Khan pumps all the iron and grit into the role of Kabir Khan, and one feels the pains of his subdued but powerful acting. His body language, his words, his eyes  I think this is one of his best delivered performances. Why I say this is because the role does not have the regular stamp of what Shah Rukh can do and thus he is so good in this role.From the team of 16 girls  three girls stand out and capture your imagination. First a senior egoist Maharashtrian player Bindya Naik (Shilpa Shukla) who does all to break the team  but in the end crunch game against South Korea delivers the goods for India, second the small Haryana tomboyish girl Komal (Chitrashi Rawat) who is a brilliant Right In player who sacrifices her goal ambition to another player in the finals for India and third the Punjabi puttar girl Balbir (Tanya Abrol) who is fearless, with a heart of gold and a body of ruthless destroyers  whatever she speaks strikes your heart chords.Seemingly I need to mention 3 brilliant scenes in the movie that brings applaud for the sheer strength of emotions it draws  first, the McDonal scene where the girls get-to-gather and bash up eve-teasers; second, the match against Indian men's hockey team when the girls score their first goal; and third is the scene when in the finals against Australia when tomboyish Komal forgets her rivalry with another Indian girl and passes the ball to help India score a goal.How can I not forget to mention the 3 dialogues that remain with you - all are spoken by Shah Rukh. First, I can only hear one sound  India (and not regional states); second, the only villain of this team is the coach; and third, if you play well God also will not be able to take the 70 minutes of your life (the finals!).Surely the movie is too predictable and clichéd. I was expecting a more innovative direction and screenplay from Shimit Amin. Except a few characters other characters are not well developed. There is no STYLE in the movie. The regional angle though touched remains in the sidelines and as token representation. The same with the religious secularism that India boasts off  such movies are breaking grounds to highlight them, but Shimit ignores this opportunity. So does he does not give a brighter scene to the Muslim protagonist in the team  Iqbal. With Indian audiences a cursory angle to such themes would create much more patriotic feel.A good entertainer. I loved it.(Stars 7.0 out of 10)",7,2,7,19 August 2007
Ocean's Thirteen," Ocean's 13
","I had seen Ocean's 11  did not like it a bit; so did not see Ocean's 12. But with such hype around Ocean's 13, could not resist seeing the huge star cast executing a plan to rob the Casino.Again Danny Ocean gathers his bunch of guys to rob diamonds and millions from Willie Bank's newly opened Casino. This he takes as a challenge  because we as audience are made to believe that doing that robbery is impossible. But the way Danny and his gang go about planning the robbery is simply amazing.To me all the Ocean's movies themes (as they are presented) looks like as easy as getting down from a tram and leisurely walking to my home, opening the house with the key, and taking money out and waving at my own self as I walk out of my home.I know that there are die-hard fans of Ocean's series, and for them this movie would be really funny, witty, intelligent, and thriller series they can't miss. But for me  it is so degrading to the sensibilities, that I find C -grade (I won't even mention B grade here) Bollywood movie a bit better than this lousy crap. At least C grade third rate Bollywood movies at times think that their audience is a bit intelligent. But not Ocean's series! The biggest joker of the lot was poor Al Pacino  the owner of the casino, running haywire, from one place to another  managing his biggest casino empire. Did not he hire any qualified and professional staff to work in his casino? Less said the better. Waste of money, and talent of great star-cast. Steven Soderbergh, what has happened to you? You gave us a below standard The Good German recently and now this.

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Brilliant Francis McDormand all the way...
","As soon as Three Billboards outside Ebbing Missouri got the best picture and best actress Golden Globe I saw it.I had heard of the story line of the movie - A girl is raped and there are no arrests, the mother takes it in her own hands to do something about it.
I was expecting a usual rape revenge drama. But this gem is packed with much unexpected script delivered with unusual character developments and flow of events - ending in a climax that leaves us - what next?Francis McDarmond is one of my favorite actress of Hollywood. Strong, deep into the character and rarely misses a note of acting. She is brilliant as an eccentric mother and a lone ranger fighter. Her pesona reflects so much anger and grit that one feels that nothing will ever stop her.Within a town run by corrupt police to business as usual people, with eye-balling media awaiting a sensational news-story - this movie is packed with easy going overview of such events that unnerve and harass normal lives prevalent commonly in small towns all over the world.The director Martin McDonagh had seen bill-boards of unsolved crime on one of his trips that gave him the story idea and casting of Francis was kept in mind while writing this fictional story and script of the movie.There are small sub-plots in the movie with extremely well developed characters that are thrown at the audience unpredictably. Some you hate, some you love, and some of them makes you change your perspective from hate to like.A string of small anecdotal comic stream is added to bring relief in otherwise swearing overtones of abuses spoken throughout the movie. I would also point out that there are many obvious flaws and potholes in the narration, that can be overlooked. Francis McDormand brings to life a quirky character filled with remorse, tragedy with grit to fight every road-block she faces. Brilliantly portrayed.The background score of a few country tracks are very pleasing and ear-catching tunes.This movie has already collected more than 50 awards and nominated for more than 150 worldwide.

The Devil Wears Prada," Dirty Underbelly of any industry - this shows of Fashion
","The movie is based on a novel (2003) written by Lauren Weisberger which has been translated to more than 35 languages. The Director David Frankel had read the novel and later thought of making it into a movie. There were several screenplay writers who worked to finalize the movie script, but the credit was ultimately given to Aline Brosch McKenna.The movie is based on a real life true character the editor of Vogue Anna Wintour where Lauren had worked as an assistant for a short while. In the movie the role of real Anna is named Miranda (played villainously by Meryl Streep) and that of Lauren is named Andy (played by a new comer Anne Hathway).The choice of Meryl was obvious but Anne had to push herself to get the role, but the new debut of Miranda's first secretary Emily played by Emily Blunt was after auditioning 1000 aspirants.Meryl based her role and enacted it just imitating a brutal MAN running his company. The story is about how Andy who wants to be a journalist gets sucked into the fashion industry through this magazine where she gets job as a secretary to Miranda, who is a brutal task master - one who is obnoxious and never satisfied.The first secretary Emily aspires to be with Miranda, but with time Andy rises the ladder in the organization and does not realize that she is losing her love, her friends and her soul in the work she is doing.When she realizes it she quits the job and joins a firm as a journalist and there the movie ends showing Andy liberated and happy.The movie takes a shot at Fashion industry and takes a dubious view-point and presents it with enough guts to expose the underbelly of it.So this time on my second viewing - I felt that - you take any industry - and when you work in it and climb the ladder - and if you are sucked into it defending it and living it - you will not be aware of the dirty underbelly of that industry. But if one has to protect one's soul - one has to protect even if one works as a journalist - or even as a social worker or any other thing.The moment your soul takes precedence - you will feel that the work you are doing does not fulfill your search and what you are seeking. So to show the Fashion industry in bad light is a one-dimensional take. As much as fashion designers are superficial - so are journalist - so are any other professions. So this was the take of mine - while watching the movie a second time.The movie was a dud on USA box office but raked mullah on international release and became the biggest block-bluster internationally.What happened actually was that people went gaga over the designer clothes worn in the movie rather than taking the message home.I think, in my first viewing there was so much of critical buzz, that one gets dragged in the flow of positive reviews. Now after 10 years, it is a right frame of mind from which one watches the movie and gives a balanced review.Overall - it was a okay movie. I will go with 5.5 out of 10.",5,1,3,6 January 2018
Gone Baby Gone," Gone Baby Gone
","Gone Baby Gone I like Casey Affleck and his acting. Knowing Ben Affleck has directed this movie, made me more interested to see it. Reading good reviews and knowing about the story I ventured out to see it.This is a story of a private detective Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) who gets an assignment to track a missing child. Circumstances lead him to the family of the missing child and then the town police chief Captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) and detective Remy Bressant (Ed Harris). Here he unravels some disturbing truths about drug abuse in family, kidnapping rackets and an underlying mystery. I will not disclose the mystery to dilute your interest in the movie. However, this leaves Patrick in a professional, ethical emotional and moral dilemma. How he overcomes that at the end of the movie.Casey Affleck has his own style of acting and he has done a good job at it. Same thing is with Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris who have given competent performances. The direction is apt by Ben Affleck. He has done a good job on his directorial debut.The downtown and neighborhood is captured beautifully. Some sequences are also technically of high directional value  especially worth remembering are the ones when the detectives barge into the suspected child kidnappers and silent moments Casey has with his girl friend.Overall a good movie.(Stars 6.5 out of 10)",7,1,2,6 March 2008
The Bourne Ultimatum," Bourne Ultimatum
","This is the trilogy of Bourne series. I had read the first novel about two decades ago, and the thrill of the imagining oneself as Bourne still remains with me, so I was excited to see what this new Bourne movie is to deliver.The story line is wafer thin. CIA Government agents want to kill Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) who is trying to find out about his past. This leads to a global chase from Moscow to London to France to Berlin to Madrid to Morocco to New York (a side mention of India  just in talks). Obviously, in the end Jason Bourne remains unhurt and a winner  super hero! Director Paul Greengrass has maintained the same tempo as Bourne Supremacy. He uses hand held camera work (jarring and giddy) and quick edits (straining and blinding) to communicate a fast pace, but it leaves especially our eyes strained a lot.As there is no story  there is a lot of actions. So actions lovers would love this movie. The feel one gets after seeing Jason Bourne is a resemblance to James Bond movies (but those have a lot of substance to it). Matt Damon is okay, a bit puffy faced.Like Indian Bollywood movies  once we keep our brains outside the theatres and being empty-heads, watch this movie  this movie is somewhat enjoyable. Otherwise to accept those stupid globe trotting, easy sneak ins, child-play stunts, scratch-less hero, clichéd villains, perfect predictions of our hero - of cc-TV camera movements and people who follow him, etc. There are so many moments  where you shake your head and say to yourself  okay, this is a stupid movie silly, so do not use your gray cells! Coincidently I saw the movie on 13 Sep. So what? Jason Bourne's birthday was shown as 13 Sep.As lots of Indian movies show their weird macho society's ego trip  so does this works to satisfy foolish American macho society's alter ego trip.(Stars 4.5 out of 10)",4,0,3,15 September 2007
Léon: The Professional," Leon
","Number 40 in IMDb Top movies list! This is a love story about a 40 year old hit man Leon (Jean Reno) who gets involved by giving refuge to a 12 year old young girl Mathilda (Natalie Portman) whose family is killed by crazy drug cop Norman (Gary Oldman). Leon teaches Mathilda the job of an assassin, and takes revenge on the people who killed Mathilda's family.Even though the plot is simple the narrative is brilliant. It shows a tender relationship of 40 year old man with 12 year old girl. It sounds very corny! Is not it? But the execution of those tender scenes is handled with good apt. Some scenes and parts do go over the top and are less convincing but the growing up young girl's angle on love and the infatuation towards a fatherly figure is shown well.The story also unfolds not in the usual line of revenge drama, nor does it take you in the showing many characters and blood and gore of routine mafia films. There are calm and dramatic moments in the film. The camera work, music and direction are top class.Luc Besson as the director of this movie has done a fantastic job. The casting of Jean Reno  though looks a bit odd  I think is perfect. Jean delivers the role with that isolation psyche syndrome who finds it difficult to relate to a young girl, but still has feelings and emotions in him.The actions sequences are well drafted and shot. Some of them are brilliant  just for the big screen viewing.Towards the end of the movie, you want to see Leon and Mathilda meet again for the last time. Does it happen? For that you need to see the movie and decide.I will go for 7.75 stars out of 10 for this movie. Good one! (Stars 7.75 out of 10)",8,0,2,11 August 2007

","I went to see this movie only because it had one of the Bollywood leading lady  Aishwarya Rai. I knew the movie had poor ratings and did not expect much from it before entering the theatres.The story is about the blood line of Julius Ceaser  a young child Romulus Augustus (Thomas Sangster) whose parents are killed, kingdom overthrown and he imprisoned. His personal guard Aurelius (Colin Firth) joins hands with a couple of his own guards and Mira (Aishwarya Rai) and with the help of a sorcerer Merlin (Ben Kingsley) rescues the child and defeats the enemies.The movie is stupid to say the least, as if we are seeing some B-grade movies of 70s. It has good sets, and excellent actions; but the screenplay and dialogues are a big let down. Overall the casting is very poor. Colin Firth huffs and puffs to fit the role of a warrior guard, and so overacts Thomas as a child emperor. Ben Kingsley  what are you doing in this movie? As a moral guardian of the young emperor Ben Kingsley still sounds like Mahatma Gandhi when he opens his mouth and says some philosophical and thoughtful things. Aishwarya was okay. To make her look like an Indian beauty the make-up artist put layers of brown shining dusk on her face and body. She performed her role with commitment, but over-expressed herself in violent actions scenes.For director Doug Lefler, this was his second ambitious project and that too with historic setting. I should say that the quality of details in expensive sets and costume etc. was finely done. The action scenes were good but not up to the mark of great directors.So what was positive about this movie? I think it is a good entertainment for children and family. It does not have a heavy complicated story, and gory of sex and violence  that is normally seen in such movies. It is a clean entertainer in that way.(Stars 4.5 out of 10)",4,15,27,17 August 2007

","When I saw the trailers, I got interested in seeing the movie. I found the concept quite good. I read its reviews in the Amsterdam Weekly, which were not so great, so I was in two minds  but still decided to go and see the movie. The story is based on true event.Ben Campbell (Jim Strugess) is brilliant in his academics, and aspires to be at the Harvard Medical School, but does not have USD 300K for fees. Prof. Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey) comes to Ben's rescue when he knows Ben's expertise with numbers. Micky picks Ben along with a team of four other students. He trains them to master the computations that would surely help win the game of Black Jack at the Las Vegas casinos. Things work in the beginning, but once Ben makes an error and looses money, Micky abondons the team. Ben and the team try out things on their own, but Casino Manager - Cole Williams (Lawrence Fishburne) finds out the trick and beats Ben up. Micky takes away all Ben's savings, de-grades him in his classes. Ben without any choice  approaches Micky to join hands for one last time and have a BIG go to get back the lost money. Micky agrees and the rest forms the end of the movie. Will they succeed? The movie has an interesting premise. Ben Campbell though has acted well, does not fill life and soul into the role, nor does his chemistry work with the heroine of the movie Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth). Whenever Kevin Spacey or Lawrence Fishburne are on the screen, the story becomes more intense. So there is a patchiness in the way the story moves  with jerks of interest and boredom. But in the last twenty minutes the movie catches up with the missed opportunities and finally I felt quite okay and satisfied with the movie.Australian born young director Robert Luketic does a decent job in the movie. I think a bit of good editing could have reduced the time by 15-20 minutes.I think this movie would be liked and enjoyed by school and college going students more, as there are sub-plots, topics of money and images that might interest them.Overall above average 6.25 rating out of 10.",6,1,2,30 June 2008

","With the Pathe membership pass on hand  I started to study the Pathe web site and studying the movies that are running in theaters. I came across good reviews of this movie. I had seen reviews of this movie on CNN TV in Amsterdam.I went to see this movie at Pathe Tunishchi Theatre Hall. This was the third of Pathe theater I was visiting in Amsterdam. It is the oldest Pathe Theatre. It has historic looking wooden interior. It is also famous for Love seats for couples.The movie is about a young 9 year old girl who gets a chance to take part in a beauty contest because another girl has opted out. The 9 year old girl's family consists of her father  who is a typical American  boastful positive speaker, her mother  who sees through the crap of her husbands' hollow optimism talk, her brother  who is so fed up with the family that has taken a silence vow  until he gets admission in the air-force, her maternal uncle  who is a brilliant professor  who is also gay  and brought home after his failed attempt to commit suicide because his gay partner ditches him for his rival professor who receives the nation's best philosophy prize; and lastly the young girls paternal grandfather  who is a jolly, loud mouth, drug addict even at this old age, who believes in the joy of living life fully  and enjoying as much sex as possible.With these carefully drafted characters  instantaneously one gets drawn into the movie's flow when with hesitation  everyone of the family agrees to travel 18 hours journey in a home van - to take part in the beauty pageant  for the sake of this 9 year old lovely  fat chubby girl.This is a journey that breaks, joins, breaks and unites the family in the end. The journey solves human dilemmas and notions in a very subtle but effective way through comical situations and dialogs.All the characters have acted well. The only thing in the movie that is not acceptable is the death of grand father along the journey and the dead body being carried around in the back of the van. In the midst of the death scene also one does not stop laughing  but reflecting back  one does not get convinced with the situation.The ending of the movie is the most inspiring and sends out a strong message against  the relevance of beauty pageants and humans have started considering everything in life like beauty pageant. This is reflected in a very lovely exchange between the professor and the young boy  who says that 'everyone's whole life is like this silly beauty pageant'.At the end of the movie it is so pitiful to see the young girls of 5-10 years being tortured to act and behave like beauty queens  and it tells the story of today's times.A very good movie!",8,8,14,7 January 2007

","Number 24 in the list of top movies! An advertising agent Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is mistaken for a non-existent and virtual government agent George Kaplan and chased around the country by agents and he finds ways to survive them all with a bit of humor and an affair with another mysterious agent Eva Kendall (Eva Marie Saint).This Alfred Hitchcock movie has the typical stamp of all Alfred Hitchcock movies. It is fast paced, it is set in urban areas, it has mystery and suspense, it has good humor and it has some good sets.Some scenes are memorable, the first when Alfred makes his cameo in the beginning of the movie when he misses catching a city bus, the glider plane scene that comes to attack Cary Grant, and the final action against the backdrop of Statues of Great American Presidents. All of them make great viewing. I could imagine with Hitchcock and Cary in their prime popularity would have raked great reviews when the movie would had been released.Today, after 48 years  the movie still remains watch-able, pleasant, and over-all a good cinematic experience; but surely it does not give the same amount of classic mastery feel that some other Hitchcockian movies has.The drunken driving scene of Cary Grant is so poorly executed with Cary overacting to the hilt of affairs and looks so artificial, un-natural and over-dramatic. Otherwise Cary Grant has charming personality. Seeing Eva Marie Saint reminded me of Julia Roberts  Julia Roberts rise to fame must have to do with the type of looks she has  typical American Hollywood heroines.The music as in all Hitchcock movie is very Jazz and Mozart type  especially in chase and action scenes.A good movie, but I won't agree it being a great classic by the master.(Stars 6.5 out of 10)",7,1,3,12 August 2007
The Shining," The Shining
","This is the 1980 movies and when I saw its poster I immediately remembered and related the Jack Nicholson's photo that matched the poster of this movie. This was the poster that was on a book  Top 1000 movies to see before you die. I read the reviews of this movie  good and bad both; especially those who hated the movie were those who had read the book. I was fortunate that I saw the moving without reading the book. This helps in enjoying it more.So this was my opportunity to see the movie. The prior knowledge that this movie is a horror movie is not a good thing to know, because one pre-conditions one mind to prepare for seeing something horror  and that is the drawback of our minds.The story is based on Stephen King's novel  The Shining. It is about a hotel in US that remains closed during winter snowing for six months. The author Jack Torrence (Jack Nicholson), wants to go to an isolated place to write a new book and remove the writer's block. He is selected as a care-taker for 6 months of this hotel, and plans to go with his wife (Shelley Duvall) and son (Danny Lloyd). In the beginning they are very happy and excited to be in this enormous place with nobody around. But as time passes Jack starts becoming insane due to these isolation, and the ghosts of the hotel inspire him to kill his son.The movie mostly revolves around these three characters, but there are two more big characters in the movies  the sound track and camera work. The knowledge of this being a horror movie  makes us view every scene with an expectation of something will happen, and that is what creates a feeling of tension. A simple shot of child driving his small tricycle in the empty corridors of the hotel is chilling to say the least. The child stopping and looking at the half open door  is enormously terrifying than seeing a crude make-up ghost in drab movies like Evil Dead etc.The director  Stanley Kubrick has not used night scenes, dark images, shocking editing, sudden entry, loud bangs to awake us to realize it is a horror movie. But he uses subtle consistent musical score that builds up on your nerves. The opening long shots of the journey to the mountain are breath-taking.Jack Nicholson is as his usual self. He has his own style and whims. Anyways as always he has acted well. Shelley Duvall brings life to her role as a typical housewife  who is modest, next door looks, and humane to protect her husband and son; and Danny Lloyd is the best (he actually won the best supporting actor's award) in his role and portrayed the child's character brilliantly.A trivia I read was that Danny Lloyd did not know that he is working in a horror movie  while shooting was on, and even after 2 years on  he did not know it. He just acted in one more movie before retiring to routine life.I consider this movie very similar to Omen in creating fear  without using the commercial gimmick of horror movies. Now I can venture to read the book. People say that the book is better than the movie. So I can enjoy it more! (Stars 7.5 out of 10)",7,1,3,3 July 2007

","Much hype, Russian director, superb star cast, action movie, big scale, great stunts  that is what I saw in the trailers; added to that a few friends who saw the movie  recommended it as a very good movie. So here, I go to see the movie.Wesley (James McAvoy) is an accountant  bullied, worried and bankrupt. In a supermarket shootout action  Wesley knows through Fox (Angelina Jolie) and Sloan (Morgan Freeman) that he is the son of an assassin. Soon he gets involved in being rigorously trained by this assassination cult. His missions are to kill bad people. In one mission, his target becomes his own father, and that is the time  Wesley realizes the real story behind everything happening to him. I won't give spoilers here  but Wesley in the end, does take his father's place by eliminating all the bad guys.This movie is a collassal waste of money, with senseless action sense and a story that only naïve person can write. One has to keep our brains out while watching the movie.The Russian director Timur Bekmambetov  Hollywood outing does not fetch him any great points and he has to wait for another good story and movie to showcase his talent. Surely his talent is shown in mega-scale actions and mystical suspense  but that does not bite the audience taste.James McAvoy, a good actor  does everything that his director asks him to do  but the movie is not a Matrix to fire anything for him. Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman  are those stars who would fetch the director some good audiences, but nothing sustains in the end.The actions are high speed and out of the world  whatever one can imagine one can find here. Believe in the instinct and one can curve the path of bullet while shooting  that is the type of stuff they show.For very hard core actions friends  who just want fun, this is their outing.(Stars 4.25 out of 10)",4,3,7,10 September 2008
Dangal," Sugar coated Regressive portrayal of feminine gender
","I am aware that many people would not like to read my review. I have no doubt that the movie viewing experience with its emotional pot-boiler roller coaster ride engages and is a good one, better than the Indian, regional and vernacular soap-opera dished out on Indian television. (That is why I am giving 7 out of 10 rating)But if a sensitive person looks beyond the cosmetics of movie dazzles – you will find someone is selling a regressive message through this film. Kodus to Dangal team for achieving such a feat. Here is my take..When the first poster of the movie was released I did not like it. Even though being a wrestler, why four girls should look like boys was the first question I raised.Now after reading so much appreciation and reviews of the movie I say this: This is another patriarchal portrayal of regressive India  A father forces his dreams on children. One should never do  Children should be kept free to develop and grow as they want  This is again patriarchy dominance on the feminine gender and forcing it with the power of parenting to subjugate the flourishing of women's gender.  For sure the flourishing of women's gender is not in imitating men and/or boys and becoming fighters, wrestlers and looking masculine. This is degrading the pride, dignity and respect of being a woman  To use a true success story of a single case and successfully use it as propaganda for women's emancipation is sickening to say the least. The negative fallout of this movie could be:  Irrespective of boys or girls many parents will force their children (and more so to girls) to do what they failed to achieve in life. Make their children do things that they as parents have dreamed. Sick mentality!  Many girls may start behaving like boys - wearing boys dress, cutting hair like boys, fighting like boys etc. etc. not at all in the spirit of humanism  Father in the movie saying that 'My girls are no less than boys'. Such comparisons are not needed in today's evolved society. This is a phrase of sixties India. It is similar to always call a girl 'Tom Boy' and demean and insult her sexuality. Such comparisons just distort the femininity of girls and women, who mis-understand such statements as being treated like boys rather than girls  Addressing girls as a male gender and treating one like that - the society like India - parents may do that to destroy the little bit of remaining self-esteem that girls and women - have on their given gender and sexuality  I also am bothered - as I always tell everyone about it is MAN - in capitals that drive the so called women's emancipation and empowerment agenda - It is so disturbing to see this. The four writers of the movie are men, the director of the movie is wearing men's glasses, the so called super-star gender sensitive actor Amir Khan is too wearing a man's hat. In propaganda of spreading regressive message through this film the team too is of men - the director, writer, producer and lead actor - all men - who drive to influence the society in a way that may create a distorted image of what is meant by women empowerment.  In real life on which the movie is based the father of the wrestling girls drives their lives. Such case studies should have been presented more sensitively by showing – such things need not be done – even though in the end it brings laurels for the country. Though I agree the medium of cinema when used with shrewdness can garner enough emotions within ignorant movie goers about nationhood to back the protagonist in whatever s/he is doing. That is what has happened in this movie - the art of good film-making -tends to overlook and ignore finer aspects of women empowerment and digs more deep into the patriarchal systems to further strengthen patriarchal roles to build the women's liberation and freedom movement I hope some readers who are sensitive human being will try to understand the point I am making and deplore such popular presentation of regressive concepts on feminism despite its all-time record breaking All India Collection. It confirms my review - Indian is still a Patriarchal society with male dominance.Have a look at the film with those lenses.",7,17,39,2 January 2017

","I had seen the trailer of the movie and found it appealing. Later I found that it is somewhat similar to Rear Window  the Hitchcock movie and is on the same lines; that made me go and see this movie.It is the story of a young boy Kale (Shia LaBeouf) who is sentenced to 3 months of house arrest and finds ways to peep through his windows in neighbors' lives  one, the recently moved neighbor girl Ashley (Sarah Roemer) and another middle aged guy Mr.Turner (David Morse) who our young boy and his friend Ronnie (Aaron Yo) suspects as a killer. Is Mr.Turner a killer? Or this is just paranoia of our young gang? The Director D.J.Caruso  who has specialized in crime thrillers in past 4-5 movies, does a very decent job in keeping the audience engrossed in the narrative and unfolds the story slowly and nicely. The movie presents many aspects of drama, and takes us through a ride of varied sub-plots with good interest. There are a couple of minor annoying scenes  like the love aspect (quite unnecessary I thought, but may be required for today's young audiences) and the usual cliché of thriller movies. But overall the movie is entertaining.Shia LaBeouf is not a great actor, but does a decent job, so does the Sarah Roemer, Aaron Yo and David Morse.The camera work is excellent because it shows only that much which would make you eager to peep beyond the camera frame to see what is there  and that keeps you engaged. The music is okay.Yes, the movie is not close to the classic Rear Window, but I should say that I liked the movie.(Stars 6.75 out of 10)",7,39,67,29 August 2007
Dreamgirls," Dreamgirls
","Dream Girls The thing that attracted me about 'Dream Girls' were not the three protagonist, nor Jamie Foxx or Eddie Murphy, but through it tailors it looked to me that it was an all black movie, which is rare to see and not many of such genre are made.This musical is the story of three girls  Beyonce, Jennifer Hudson and Anika Noni Rose who have dreams to make it big as a group and how they are picked up by a musical business tycoon Jamie Foxx to work with Eddie Murphy's troop, and how there is a split among these girls  because Jennifer who is a lead singer is sidelined for the beautiful Beyonce to appeal and sell the music. Many of these stories run parallel to each other, with rise and fall in their relationships, ups and downs in their careers. The tragedy of Jennifer Hudson's life was shown very touchingly. She loves singing but is neglected in utter poverty. In the end Jennifer gets to chance to sing as a lead singer and the dream girls fulfill their life long dream by getting together.All the actors have acted well. But two persons who steal the show are Jennifer Hudson  who portrays the range of emotions naturally - betrayal, anger, jealousy, sadness, happiness  and Jamie Foxx as a money minded business person, whose interest in life never ascends above measuring things only by money.The integration of musical score and the moving storyline is crafted beautifully and none of the songs jars our senses, but I especially got appreciative of the western classical score and the emotions depicted through them.Overall a different movie and a good movie too!

","Lots of time without much fanfare some movies are released, and amidst all the new movies  lots of time they get lost. It requires special skills to keep your sense open to read reviews from papers and friends to identify and be aware of some good movies are running. Control falls into that category.This is a true story of British iconic signer Ian Curtis (Sam Riley) who is young, ambitious and dreamer. At tender age of 17-18 years gets involved with his friend's fiancée Deborah Curtis (Samantha Morton), and marries her. Parallel to that his career builds up as a lead singer with a small group called Joy Division. Years pass by and Ian gets involved with a journalist Annik (Alexandra Maira Lara) who comes to interview the rising stars. Ian troubles increase when he faces the terrible epileptic attacks. He is under pressure to deliver professionally  something new every time he is on stage. He does not feel the same passion with increasing commercial pressures. Ian remains confused and is not able to decide between his wife Deborah and his lover Annik  to both he hides his emotions and starts telling lies. In that depressed state  he starts drinking (which is bad for an epileptic) and feels falsely rejected and hated by everyone around him  finally leading him to get miserably drunk, and after a severe epileptic attack, commits suicide by hanging himself.This movie is co-produced by Ian's wife Deborah Curtis, who has also written a biography Touching from a Distance  on which the movie is based. This is Dutch still camera photographer and music video maker turned Movie Director Anton Cobijn debut movie. He has done a marvelous job as a Director. The movie is shot in Black and White by cinematographer Martin Ruhe (I thought Anton would shoot the images himself). But the screen canvass is wonderfully shot  each image looking like a post-card perfect picture.A special mention of the musical score used in original of Joy Division band. It is reminisces of 70's era and music.Sam Riley digs deep into the psyche of Ian's character and one can not imagine Ian being any different from Sam. Brilliant role and performance which is well supported by all the other cast! Sam has already won 1 award for this role and the movie gathered 7 awards totally, and I think there would be more to come.Hats off to Anton Cobijn to delicately handle this difficult subject of a singer's 4-5 years short life with such finesse!

He gets 3 years in jail. When he comes out he finds his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) walk on the same path as he had walked. Derek attempts to persuade Danny not to be like him but follow the path of life that is without hate. In between the movie deals with flashback on the transformation of Derek in the prison.The movie attempt is strong. The Director Tony Kate must have taken lots of guts to make this movie on racism and hate. It is not amazing to know that in its titles he did not want his name to be mentioned  (instead he preferred Hummpy Dummpy) just of the fear of being targeted by both black and white groups.The movie is bold, touches the most relevant subject of hatred between different people. But half way through the movie I felt that it has become too preachy. I also had this notion that Jews must have produced it. I do not know whether it is true  but there was one silly dialogue in the movie that will remain in my memory  You look good, you look like a Jew. That itself was racist and discriminating and negative conditioning.That apart, Edward Norton played the role really well. He was fortunate to get good roles in his career  Fight Club and then this. Now a day he has lost his ability, rawness and spontaneity.This movie can also become so relevant in today's India where the fanatic Brahmins wants to teach hatred to their children for lower castes, untouchables, minorities etc.Technically the movie is brilliant. It uses good black and white flashbacks and color current events. The camera work, the prison shots etc. are very authentic. The beginning sex scene was a bit overdone and totally unnecessary in the event of things in this movie.Sadly the movie starts with black committing a crime and getting killed by a racist white, and ends with racist black killing a white person.Anyways, a good representation and attempt!

I missed Saw 2, and when I heard of Saw 3  I thought of seeing it. I read the reviews on IMDb, and all but one appreciated the movie, so I went to see it, knowing that there would be blood and gore; but also expecting that there would be an interesting story line.For the first time I saw that in Amsterdam there was an usher who was checking the age of audiences through their Identity cards. Also a vomit bag was provided with instructions on it about the gut wrenching scenes in the movie.With this background let me go straight into the story line. I found the movie totally absurd. Its only focus seemed to be showing different technique of how to kill people in the most disgusting ways. One after another it kept on showing it. The actors and actresses were amateurs and did not act well. The photography was as expected it would be  with more hand held camera  as if someone / or something is following the character which is being shown. The lighting throughout the movie was poor  as if fear can only be projected through dark images. There was irritating sound track added throughout the movie  that did not fit the scene. There were references and cuts to several shots  that seem difficult to understand for those who are seeing Saw series for the first time. I suppose they were from the previous movies. The directors managed to gather enough audiences to see the movie through their franchise and marketing skills.The movie was bad in all aspects of movie making. More disgusting than what was shown in the movie was when a few die-hard fans of Saw series stood up at the end of the movie and clapped appreciating the movie.

The police try to solve the mystery and find the murderer. Who is the murderer is the final twist in the tale  that is disclosed in the last two minutes.The only survivor is Verbal (Kevin Spacey) and the four other crooks are Michael McManus (Stephan Baldwin), Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro) and Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak). The interrogating customs officer Dave Kujan is played by Chazz Palminteri. All the actors have acted well and the movie holds interest till the last scene.But the movie does not live up to the suspense and expectation that it builds. The ending and disclosure of the murderer is childish. One laughs at the Director Bryan Singer on how he thinks of creating suspense  totally foolish. When there are characters who play role in the movie and engage audience in guessing  that make the movie interesting. But coming out with a stupid ending like this does not serve good for the creativity of being a director. With such dubious ending, the director could have taken any option totally unrelated to the movie and presented as if the mystery is solved.So was there a mystery. Obviously not!

When I heard that they are in contention of the Oscars nominations, I was too eager and itching to see this release.Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) finds a bag full of money - $ 2 million  among dead bodies from a place in remote outskirt desert of a Texas town, where a shootout has taken place. He gets the bag home without realizing that a maniac killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), who will do anything to track Llewelyn down - would follow him. The local police Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) also track the leads. The cat and mouse game start. After enough of surprises - twists and turns we come to the end of the movie.The movie is based on the novel (by the same name) by Cormac McCarthy. Though filmed exactly in sequence from the book, the ending is a little dampening in the sense that it is not what we expected. However, this should not to take away the fantastic movie experience one gets out of watching this movie. The script and screenplay are tight and very well adapted to its core. Coen brothers again do wonders together. For a formative student who is learning movie making, watching the movie a couple of times would greatly help.Among actors  Javier Bardem steals the show as a mean maniac killer. He is a delight to watch with his weirdness, especially when he is simply talking with someone.The music is minimal  as usual of Coen style and the editing by Coen brothers under pseudo name Roderick Jaynes is good.(Stars 7.75 out of 10)",8,1,5,6 March 2008

","I went to see this movie because of it had Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck, and it is a western movie with great cinematography.It is a true story is about American legend Jesse James (Brad Pitt) and his new gang member Robert Ford (Casey Affleck), who has idolized Jesse from childhood. There is a sub-plot where Jesse's brother is killed by another gang member and Robert keeps this fact hidden from Jesse, causes doubts and suspicion in the very sharp and neurotic Jesse James  who sees through Robert's lies. This causes a strange bit of relationship between these two characters. Jesse weirdness and swinging moods has such a hold and control over Robert that Robert is scared to death. In one such moment of fear, Robert shoots Jesse and kills him. Robert is honored by government, enacts stage performances of Jesse's killings. Robert is not able to live this life where people around him hate him for killing Jesse. At the end of the movie, Robert is shot by stranger.Brad Pitt is one of the producers and the movie is directed by Andew Dominik (Chopper fame  again based on a true story assassin). Roger Deakins is the director of photography and has shot the movie with such a heavenly feel that irrespective of anything; a true movie lover can go and sit in this movie for the sheer magic of the image on the BIG screen canvas.Bard Pitt has acted very well and remains an enigma personified of Jesse James. But I liked Casey Affleck's awkwardness, subtlety, fear psychosis and dilemmas as Robert Ford are superb.The movie is long, 160 minutes; but the time well worth for getting absorbed into the story and characters. It reminded me of Zodiac. Similarly, this is the sixteenth movie made on Jesse James, and I can assure that the treatment of this movie is amazingly different from any other movie you would have seen of Jesse James.(Stars 8 out of 10)",8,0,1,11 November 2007

He also tries pursues a relationship with a gifted singer boy Pierre's (Jean  Baptiste Maunier) mother Violette (Marie Brunel), who falls in love with an engineer instead.This is the first full fetch movie of the musician convert to Director Chritophe Barratier, who has won tremendous applause and credibility across the world, through this movie. The direction is good, the cinematography is excellent, and music heavenly. Yes at times the scripting, characters and events are clichéd. Gerard has given an outstanding performance as warm Clement Mathieu, with subtle expressions and emotions hidden behind his chubby self that is remarkable.It is a French movie and I loved it. Some movies make you fill with you much happiness and joy that you feel satisfied after the viewing. This is that kind of a movie.(Stars 7.75 out of 10)",8,3,3,23 September 2007
The Pianist," The Pianist
","It was since the time the movie was released and won Oscar I wanted to see this movie. At last I got the time and occasion to see it.The story is about a famous young Polist Jew pianist in Warsaw, Germany during World war II (1939-1944) Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody). The Jews  including his family and he are subjected to atrocities by German army and subjected to move from their palatial upper class living to smaller quarters, and the journey continues till they are boarded to a train leading to gas chamber. Wladyslaw manages to escape the train journey and finds refuge at different places in most trying circumstances. Many a times nearing occasions of death and being caught; Wladysalw survives the War in the end, when he is rescued by the invading Polish army.Director Roman Polaski, who himself is a Polish Jew, had suffered and experienced similar circumstances during WW II. This is one of the most grandeur scale movie the Roman has directed till date. The set are magninomious, and the details of War and its impact on Warsaw city is depicted with utmost reality. The ghetto of Jew neighborhood with a segregating wall in between is chilling, so are numerous scenes when innocent Jews are shown being killed without any reason.Though this is a movie of a pianist, its main theme is to show the world (one more time) the atrocities Jews faced in Germany during WWII. This time  the master is at work. It just happens that the protagonist is a pianist, it could have had been anyone. It does not matter  because the purpose seems evidently clear  to show how Jews suffered during WWII.Adrien Brody does a great job in bringing a real character and his fears, desires to life. He lives the role in body and skin. He acting is a treat to watch.The cinematography is superb. It is obvious the movie must be very well funded.One question that intrigued me throughout the movie was  Why were Jews segregrated and killed by Germans? I tried to google it, and most of the blame goes to Hitler, who wanted to eliminate a few races. I also read that Jews are most arrogant, clever, intelligent and shrewd blood sucking money making machines, who are very mean in their business. I may need to read some what more on this before I can make my own conclusion.There is nothing new or great about the theme, but a good movie by a master Roman Polaski. It surely had to won accolades in US, as Jews rule the business world  especially Hollywood.(Stars 7.5 out of 10)",8,1,3,24 March 2008
Gone Girl," Gone Girl - Good Execution rendered with Pot Holes
","Gone GirlBy Raj DoctorThe movie was consistently rated 4 or 4.5 out of 5 by most critics. The IMDb rated it quite high at 8.5 out of 10. The Director is David Fincher – of Seven, Panic Room, Fight Club, Zodiac and Social Network fame. Gillian Flynn (resembling a bit the movie actress Rosamund Pike) the author of the 6-million plus copies sold 'Gone Girl' was on New York Best sellers' list for more than 10 weeks. Does it get any better – not to see this film?David Fincher has made movies on various subjects and is considered master of adapting books and novels into movies. It might be his phase of life where he wanted to explore couple relationship and he found an apt book through Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl.The story– Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) discovers his wife Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) missing, and reports to the police. Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) investigates the case and the audience is taken into exploring the case clues – that somewhat point to Nick's hand in the disappearance of his wife. In flashback it is shown Nick having relationship outside marriage and having bad temper – thus becomes the unassuming suspect in the eyes of police, audience and to some extend Nick's twin-sister Margo (Carrie Coon) who supports Nick in every way. Just around half-time we know that Amy is alive, and she is the one who has orchestrated the disappearance act to take revenge on unfaithful husband Nick. How Amy returns back to Nick forms the rest of the story. The movie is surely about issues around modern couples and their relationships within marriage. Not one partner is true – there are lies, cheating, hate, deception within their interaction, yet they are together. Ben Affleck is effortless and does not have to do much in terms of acting, and yet he justifies his role and the mystery around his cheating character. Amy Dunne plays a very contrived – so called referred (in the movie) as sociopath – and she brings much nuances in her role with her expressions to understand what goes in her mind. The remaining star cast is okay. Kim Dickens role as a detective reminded us of Fargo's Frances McDormand, but Kim's role did not have that much depth.The first hour of the movie is just a built up and slow. Nothing much is happening. The second half picks up and holds attention. I could not fathom why a wife should go to such an extend to take revenge of her husband by enacting her own disappearance and murder? (Sociopath?) I would not say that there was anything wrong with the film's execution. I have read that Director David Fincher has been very faithful at the adaptation of screenplay which is also written by the authoress of the novel - Gillian Flynn.I think there is a problem in the plot of the novel itself. It may be well written and surely liked by people – as it is a best seller. But there are BIG pot holes in the story itself. I would not dwell into it – one can read the IMDb hated reviews to understand those.Ending is one point that is discussed and debated a lot – but I do not find it worthy to discuss much. It is this - husband and wife continue to stay together within the marriage knowing each other's dark sides.Overall, the movie was okay. Well directed – but bland. As what happens now a day to most of the movies – it is over-hyped and under-delivered. I found Gone Girl suffering from that psychosis. Nothing amiss if you miss seeing it and nothing to give such high rating! (Rating 6.75 out of 10)",7,1,7,4 November 2014
The Number 23," The Number 23
","I like Jim Carrey, not because he is a comedian, but because he emerged as a serious actor in attempting to select good roles that will give him the variety of dimensions to display his talent.The story of the movie is about a happy married man Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey) and his wife Agatha (Virginia Madsen) and son Robin (Logan Lerman). One day as a gift his wife presents him with a novel The Number 23. On reading it Walter realizes the similarities the novel has with his life. The novel turns out to be a thriller with a murder mystery. Walter gets engaged into the paranoia of number 23 and tries to find a running parallel in real life to identify the characters and solve the murder mystery. Like a detective Walter traces the murderer and unknown writer of the novel. One clue leads to another, and another  until the end, the real murderer is exposed. I won't tell you the secret. Just a clue that the novel is written by someone named Topsy Eret.The narrative of the movie is a bit puzzling, and I think the Director Joel Schumacher must have intentionally worked on it that way. Why I say this is because after the movie got over, I had the urge to see the movie again to understand the early half properly, and get more clarity in why the story is told in this manner and how the events are unfolded. But will I go and see the movie again, not really.The movie is good, but not brilliant. It eclipse on the fringe areas of brilliance but falls shorts due to its direction. In the past Joel Schumacher has struggled to make commercially successful movie even with a good storyline on his hand. Here too he flounders. The saving grace of this thriller is one and only  Jim Carrey, who carries the whole burden of this movie on his shoulder, and makes us believe in the magical number 23.After seeing the movie, I remembered my Dad who has paranoia of number 5. The amazing past time my Dad and Mom together had was when they found ways to add, subtract, multiply and divide any number to arrive at an answer that was 5. It is a unique ability and obviously paranoia. But it is amusing.The same paranoia has been presented here with a mysterious thriller storyline. To some extend the director achieves success to telling us this novel story of number 23.Jim Carrey looks haggard with age, but has played the character brilliantly. Virginia Madsen and Logan Lerman have acted decently but nothing worth historic to mention here.Go and see it if you are a Jim Carrey fan or if you have a fascination for NUMBERS, both ways you will enjoy this movie.(Stars 6 out of 10)",6,58,99,10 June 2007
The Lives of Others," Das Laben der Andersen
","Das Leben der Andersen When Das Leben der Andersen took part at the Rotterdam International Film Festival, I had read raving reviews of it. I remembered its promo advertisement, but I forgot its name. This week when I was trying to find out about this movie on the web, every web site critic had given high rating and rave reviews of the movie. And only after seeing the movie I knew that this movie has won the 'Best Foreign Film Oscar award'.The story is set up in 1984 East Germany when the government monitored the lives of people through civilian informants. Ulrich Muhe plays Gerd - the civilian informant and Sebastian Koch (remember Zwartoek?) plays Georg - the journalist writer who is not considered loyal to East Germany. Georg is identified and every move of his is monitored meticulously. But the story's pivotal character is Ulrich who is trained like a machine / robot by Germans to perform a duty to minute every breath of Georg. The interesting part of the movie is the transformation within Ulrich into a human being. But the compelling part comes when the story brings Ulrich is called by duty to pin Georg. The last 40 minutes of the movie is very enjoyable and satisfying.There is a bit of slack in the editing of some scenes where the flows of scenes are not in synchronization.This is just the sixth movie of the young Director (he is just 34 years old) Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, and I think he is done a marvelous job.I liked the movie, I would not say I loved it. It is a pattern within Oscar's foreign film awards that they tend to give awards to political or sad movies, as if that is the only criteria of selecting winners!? I doubt! That means that this year there was no good foreign language movie better than this? I doubt that too! (Stars 7.5 out of 10)",Null,1,9,10 March 2007
Room," Sky-light to the human SOUL
","The novel and movie was inspired from the true Austrian Fritzl case of 2008, where the father kept her daughter captive for 24 years in a basement and raped her over that period that resulted in birth of 7 children - 3 remained with the daughter, 3 with the father with his wife and 1 had died after birth.The novel written by Emma Donoghue has the same premises, but is a fictional account. The story is told from the eyes of the little boy. Here the perpetrator is a stranger who kidnapped and keeps a 16 year old girl captive in a 11X11 feet cramped room (which has a tub, wash-basin, toilet, kitchen bed, cupboard, a TV and only one skylight) for 7 years.The movie starts when Joy is 24 year old women with her 5 year old son Jack in this tiny space where they create their own world. It is a gritty story of survival of Joy and her mother's instinct to protect her son Jack and planning an escape so that they are freed from this hostile and captive room for Jack to see the wonders of the world. By the mid-point of the story Joy succeeds in her plans and is rescued by police. The second half focuses on re-integration of Joy and Jack within the society and their family but skips the perpetrator's arrest and prosecution.The main three characters Joy - (Brie Larson) Jack - (Jacob Tremblay) and Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) play their parts beautifully. Brie won the Oscars Academy award as Best Actress for this role and another Jacob had 45 award nominations from which he won 19 awards as best supporting young actor.The movie did excellent business after the Oscar award for Brie Larson. On a budget of 13 million, it did a business of 36 million world-wide.The Director Lenny Abrahamson has done a marvelous job in remaining true to the novel, thanks to the help of the author Emma who also wrote the screenplay of the movie. The movie is rated all time 136 best movies of the world rated by IMdb and has 239 nominations from which it has won 130 awards. Phenomenon.Good thing about the movie is that even after undertaking such an abusive subject, Lenny and Emma have created a clean, touching movie that moves us to tears and smiles and final triumph of human spirit. A bit slow but to transport to the lives of Joy and Jack - one needs to hold the flag of empathy. A good Drama thriller.I would go with 7.25 out of 10 P.S.
Just for those who are interested in Fritzl case, the father is life-imprisonment till death in Austrian prison and the daughter was a given a new identity and lives with her children a normal life.",7,0,1,7 May 2018
The Elephant Man," The Elephant Man
","On many web-sites this movie was a common factor in top classic movies. I was quite interested to see it. I also saw the IMDb review and the poster and that appealed me more. I was too eager to settle down on my chair to view this classic.This is a second half of 19th century (1860-87) true story of a Joseph Merrick (John Hurt) man with physical abnormalities thus the name Elephant Man. A surgeon Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) gives refuge to Joseph in his hospital and makes him part of the high circle society of England. But still Joseph faces humiliation from people due to his looks. In the end of the movie Joseph is given standing ovation by the then Queen Victoria and all eminent people.The movie though based on a true story is a distorted version. Joseph was affected at an age of five by elephantiasis  but the movie starts with a dramatic misrepresentation of a dream sequence (or I do not know real) of an elephant raping a young woman  through whom assumingly this boy is born. The movie's script is a big let down. It showcases typical irritating British-ness; exaggerate the miseries of the man and the goodness of rich British people. Most of the poor people are shown as villainous clowns who are insensitive, ignorant, uneducated, rascals; whereas the rich class is shown as overly sensitive and humane to ugly Joseph. Again I think a total mis-representation! This movie reminded me of a documentary I have seen recently Darwin's Nightmare. African poverty is shown and exploited by the Director to fetch a name in the ignorant and insensitive western audiences. Similarly here ugly looks of a person is exploited by the Director to fetch a name for himself in the ignorant and insensitive western; mostly British rich class.There are so many things that are badly scripted in the movie that I would not even venture to mention them here. Most IMDb reviews rate this movie very high. I am saddened by the fact that they because they have failed to relate with such characters in real life  they feel so moved in reel life.What about people who considers being humiliated throughout the life with people's insensitiveness  find this representation over the board.Acting wise I found everyone more dramatic, and overacted  including reliable Sir Anthony Hopkins. For no obvious reason at all (may be to hide the make-up of John Hurt) the movie is shown in Black and White. John Hurt due to a huge make-up and limping character, even though had some work to do; but with this character  any actor could have done an equally satisfying job.I think, Director David Lynch is not a competent director, but has achieved some mastery in showcasing miseries of people and earning a living. His list of movies proves that. He may have felt that he is sensitively portraying miseries, but actually he is exploiting miseries to make a name for himself in an insensitive British/ western society.Because of the fact that this is a true story I give 3 out of 10 for this otherwise  poor movie.(Stars 3 out of 10)",3,21,59,25 August 2007

","Based on the 1954 novel by Richard Matheson, this is the third adaptation of the story. The earlier two were The Last Man on earth (1964) and The Omega Man (1971). With its Christmas release, huge budget and production costs and general hype created around it  obviously, it was a tempting offering during Christmas holidays.Robert Neville (Will Smith) is the only man to survive the worldwide apocalypse due to a viral disease that has killed most of the human race and left the remaining humans as flesh eating zombies  who cannot come out in the light and can only come out in the dark to search their food. Robert and his dog Sam roam around deserted New York streets every day to search / hunt for food and waiting for some other survivors to contact them or works in his lab to find a viral cure. Robert encounters his own despairs and memories of his lovely wife and daughter, and battles with zombies. In one encounter with zombies, his dog is infected and dies, which leaves Robert desperate to take revenge and commit a suicidal attack on zombies. Anna (Alice Braga) - another survivor, rescues Robert. In the end, Robert dies in an effort to save Anna, but not before finding the cure for the disease.Those who have not read the original novel  might find the movie entertaining to some extend. But be aware, that except the theme, this movie does not have any close resemblance with the original story, which is many times more interesting in its content, events and story telling.This is a more ultra Americanized (American saving the worldnot again!) effort by the first time movie director Francis Lawrence, who until now only directed videos  mainly music videos for singers like Britney Spears and Jennifer Lopez.The budget is big and the production values enormous, which is seen on the cinema canvas and those visuals of deserted New York City are fascinating to say the least.The movie belongs to Will Smith all the way. He carries each scene with great maturity and presence. He is the sole recognizable character in the whole movie until the last 30 minutes when Anna enters the scene. Will Smith has done great job in acting out the emotions and range of it. He looks great with his newly built muscular physique.With good entertainment value, but poor adaptation (a lost opportunity  both for Francis and Will Smith) makes it movie an average viewing.

No Man's Land," No Man's Land
","This was the movie that I wanted to see because it had won the 2001 Best Oscar for Foreign Language Film during the same year an Indian movie called Lagaan was the top contender for the Oscars. Fortunately I got to see this movie after a period of six years.The story is about the war between Serbia and Bosnia. Three soldiers are caught  2 Bosnians Muslims and one Serb in a no-man's land patch. All are injured and one Bosnian soldier is laid on a live land mine. UN comes to help, the TV and media land up, the Bosnian and Serbian soldier die and the one of the land mine is left to die by UN  because there is no way to rescue him.It is a deeply moving story and a good exposure to the war in general. It has human drama, of hate between human beings who are no different and not born to hate and kill each other. Both Serbian and Bosnian soldiers blame each other of starting the war. But the main villains of the story emerge out to be the pathetic bureaucracy of UN Peace Keeping Force, and the media who are waiting as vultures.The first time Director of a full length feature film - Danis Tanovic, does a good job in covering gamut of issues surrounding the Serb and Bosnia war. He shows guts in exposing the ineffective UN machinery. Danis worked for 2 years on the war zone, and his experience helped in making the fictional movie very authentic in looks.The three main stars  Branko Djuric as Bosnian Ciki, Rene Bitorajac as Serb Nino and Filip Sovagovic as Bosnian Cera (lying down on the live land mine)  do a marvelous job in acting. The emotions and feelings are showcased raw.The musical score is minimal but the beginning and ending title music is haunting. Did this movie deserve an Oscar above Lagaan? Was Lagaan a better movie than No Man's Land? It must have had been a tough call for the Oscar panel to choose between Lagaan and No Man's Land. Lagaan was a wholesome Indian entertainer. It has music, emotions, human triumph, joy, celebrations, contest, good  bad, morals and a happy ending feeling. Whereas No Man's Landing was more contemporary  more western in its images, more relevant to the war debates of US. I think the panel must have related to No Man's Land much more than Lagaan.Surely if the panel of Oscar was universal  Lagaan would have bagged the Oscars. But America rules  they decide the panel and they award a movie. It remains a posterior history now! (Stars 7 out of 10)",7,2,5,21 July 2007
The Illusionist," Illusionist
","I thought that the movie must be good because it was made from the producers of 'The Crash'.The movie is a love-story about a young carpenter boy who is in love with a duchess, but is separated. He comes back as a reputed magician when the duchess is about to marry a prince - a 'to become' emperor. The director tries to bring in the romance, suspense, love, hate, jealousy, arrogance and ego in divulging the nuances of various characters. I think to a certain extend he succeeds  but to a major part of the film he does not. Most of the actors are over-board in their expressions; especially the main lead Edward Norton  who is as wooden face as one could be. The only interest arises in the film when Rufus Sewell with his negative performance as the prince is on the screen  even though he also is at times overboard in his acting. A little mention is required of Paul Giamatti as Chief Inspector who builds up an interesting character; but again overacts.Does the magician manage to get his childhood girlfriend back is the question. The director builds up the suspense and in the last 5 minutes discloses it so rapidly that we as audience are left short of fulfillment. The set up of the movie is in the late 19th century  which is well captured. All the magic tricks shown are unusual and only appeals at the moment of seeing it on screen, but does not convince the audience. Knowing that it was not the mandate of the director to show the techniques behind some tricks, but when the suspense is hastily disclosed there are so many questions unanswered  on how did the hero manage to perform such a feat.Not much more to say.",4,8,12,7 January 2007
Donnie Brasco," Donnie Brosco
","This movie was recommended to me and I saw it because of that.It is based on a true story of a FBI undercover agent Donnie Brasco (Johny Depp) who infiltrates the underworld and mafia by taking into confidence a second in-command Benjamin 'Lefty' (Al Pacino). The trust both of them build in each other pushes Donnie to a point of being a mafia himself and associating in many crimes the gang commits. There is a power struggle of their team leader Sonny Black (Michael Madsen) who over-throws their rival gang and senior boss to become a leader. It is in the end that they realize Donnie is an undercover agent, which leads to them killing Benjamin. There is a parallel plot running of problems faced by Donnie Brasco in his family life due to the kind of job he is handling.The movie reminded me a lot of Departed. Surely a part of Departed story is lifted from Donnie Brasco with additional angle of undercover mafia in police is added.But Donnie Brasco excels solely on its story and screenplay. It is honest, tight and gripping. One remains glued to the seat till the very end. Al Pacino performs the role of Lefty with such a punch and marvelous acting that puts him in the top bracket of best Hollywood actors. Johny Depp is good, but this was not his best performance.The Director Mike Newell (who took almost 30 years to make his first movie after his debut as TV director) does a very good job in direction.The story had drama and thrill in it. There were only two shooting or violent scenes in the whole movie yet one felt on the seat at every moment. That was the difference between good cinema and today's violent cinema that is sadly considered good.It shows that one can depict a mafia story with all the thrills and chills even without showing crude violence and shootings.(Stars 7.5 out of 10)",7,0,1,19 August 2007
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Holocaust from eye of an eight year old boy
","It is a movie adapted from a novel by John Boyne who also wrote the screenplay with the Director Mark Hermann who strangely has not written or directed any other movie since this one.This German story is about Bruno (Asa Butterfield) - 8 year old son of a World War 2 soldier Ralf (David Thewlis) who is transferred along with his wife Elsa (Vera Farmiga) and 12 year old daughter Gretel (Amber Beattle) to look over a Jewish concentration camp, where lonely Bruno makes friends with a Jewish 8 year old boy Shmuel (Jack Scanlon) across the camp's fence.Bruno is totally innocent about what's going on and the fact that Jews are considered enemies of Germans and systematically killed. In an attempt to search for the missing father of Shmuel - Bruno secretly digs under the fence to enter the concentration camp - but both kids meet a fatal end - as that day they are taken to the gas chamber. The movie follows a fictional story form like a fable. Though criticized for the novel and movie's improbability - the movie holds good to send the message of how wrong the whole holocaust was.The movie looks at the events unfolding through the eyes of an eight year old child with a sub-plot of an anguish wife who is not party to her husband's nationalistic work. It is well directed by Mark, and all the actors especially both boys Asa as Bruno and Jack as Shmuel have acted beautifully. The movie is haunting to say the least and its impact as well remains in one's mind even after the movie is over. It is brutal and disturbing to see one human treating other human in this way. The musical score by James Horner was so effective that until you do not pay attention to it - it remains subtle to your sense. I will go with 7 out of 10 for this movie.",7,0,0,25 November 2017
Black Snake Moan," Black Sanke Moan
","The trailer of this movie was impressive. It surely showed that the theme of the movie might be different. It also showed unusual images that are never seen before on screen. Let me unfold the story for you first.The story is about two lead characters, first Lazarus (Samuel Jackson) who is a god fearing person, ditched by his wife; second, Rae (Christina Ricci) who is madly in love with her boy friend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake), but insanely seeks love and sex in Ronnie's absence (due to childhood abuse)  who has gone to serve in the Army. By circumstances badly beaten up Rae lands up near the farm of Lazarus who shelters her. But finding Rae's intense sexual urgings literally chains her in his house, and showers immense amount of care and love to therapeutically cure Rae from seeking sexual gratification of her desires. When Ronnie half-way leaves the Army and comes back, he suspects an relationship between this two characters, but on knowing the truth  the story ends happily by Rae and Ronnie getting married and Rae using Lazarus's love to cure Ronnie's fears.The setting seems to be in the hot Texas region. The Director Craig Brewer has managed to come every time with an innovative story line (in all his last 5 directorial ventures). The language is too American with regional lingo, and at times becomes difficult to grasp. The script is tight and the story is told with an uneven pace  sometimes holds high interest, whereas sometimes slows down to artistic cinema. There are strong early scenes of sex and nudity to depict the crazy life of Rae. I found the slight bent of Lazarus character towards religion a bit too clichéd  without a moral and ethical angle of religion, the director could have let Lazarus' character be neutral and intensely human.The music  especially the guitar chords are brilliantly played and that gives the depiction a different but interesting shade.For me, who am from the eastern culture  India; such movie experiences are a bit too shocking. Just to imagine that people in America  especially young boys and girls  live their lives with such irresponsible sexual orientation, leaves me disturbed and amused.But a unique film experience to watch.(Stars 6.5 out of 10)",6,2,6,10 June 2007
The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight - Kill... the Batman!!!
","Batman  I had read the comic strips when I was young. I had seen the TV series  that was fun as a boy. I could not see Batman Begins  which I hear was really good. The hype around this release was so huge; reviews over the top and IMDb rating  topped it all. Number 1 spot of all time great ratings. Need I wait any longer? Movie starts with Joker (Heath Ledger) robbing a bank, following by Batman (Christian Bale) catching bad guys; and Joker telling the bad guys  KILL THE BATMAN. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is like super hero attorney of the city. Joker takes it on himself to find and kill the Batman. To do that he creates havoc all around the city to bring Batman out in the open; but 90 minutes through the movie Batman catches Joker and puts him behind bars. (Curtains? You can just walk out of the movie hall at this stage  but another 1 hour of mayhem is yet to come) Joker escapes prison and creates more chaos and death all around. Due to the death of Harvey's girl friend Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhaal)  Harvey turns his guns on the cops of the city. Batman manages to catch Joker again, but to keep Harvey a hero forever - Batman takes on himself the crimes of Harvey. The movie ends with cops chasing Batman.The movie has a dark comic book feel about it. However, it is not a comic book stuff. The movie is gruesome, dark, and grim. The pace is racy, the acting brilliant, the script tight, the dialogues nerve wracking.All the actors have acted brilliantly, but the movie is over-powered by the powerful and scintillating performance of Heath Ledger as Joker. He sets the screen on fire, with his terrific performance and over-shadows all the other characters.The music by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer matches the tempo of the movie, while the editing by Lee Smith of the movie is patchy and pathetic. The movie jumps from one scene to another in sharp fashion.But to assemble this huge comic book story in this dark and gruesome manner  credit should go to Director Christopher Nolan  who takes one step forward since Batman Begins. (His movie Prestige was below the big budget huge cinema) Christopher uses the entire big gimmick stuff that a movie can provide to make it a blockbuster. How I hoped that he had used better editing and more children friendly images.I enjoyed the movie  comic book in adult format.(Stars 7.5 out of 10)",Null,0,4,4 August 2008

","I had no idea what is this movie was about; but only because it was directed by Sean Penn, I got interested in seeing it. Before the show at Pathe Tushinski in Amsterdam, I read the story of the movie and realized that this is a true story which was presented in one of the Oprah Winfrey shows, so that got me more interested.A young man  Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch), after graduation, donates $ 24,000 to Oxfam and leaves his family and friends to live a dream of being alone with nature in Alaska. On his journey from Arizona, California, Colorado River and South Dakota, he ends it at the Fairbanks, Alaska  wilderness living alone on an abondaned bus. After 5 months he is found dead due to starvation.What remained for the world were his thoughts that he penned down in a diary that became a major inspiration for his biography by John Krakauer, documentary Call of the Wild by Ron Lamothe and this wonderful movie directed by Sean Penn.Director Sean Penn has well matured his skill as a screenplay writer and director (apart from acting) since his first venture The Indian Runner in 1991. He pours his heart and soul into making the movie a wonderful experience of film making. He scores top in weaving the story with flashbacks and not letting the interest drop for a single second till the very end. The cinematography by Eric Gautier is breathtaking, and so is the music.Emile Hirsch is a bit of a miscast in this role, but he has given his best performance and after a while it is very difficult to think of another actor enacting the same role. He lives the character in flesh and blood. I would have stilled liked him look more rigored throughout the movie like a wanderer's physical body rather than a well nurtured body.Surely Christopher was a lost kid, searching for answers. I think he was also stubborn and arrogant, too confident to think about himself that he can survive in the wilderness. He was a misfit in the society and would have remained so throughout his life.The same day on I was watching the BBC documentary of 2007 Virginia campus shooting by Korean boy Seung Hui Cho, and I drew similarities between these suicidal characters of Seung Hui and Christopher. Both standing on the same cross roads  former choosing violence, and the latter choosing solitude as suicide! Both thought what they are doing the right thing, and they know the real answer. Sadly both did not! This society we live in renders humans into isolation and either makes villain (as did with Seung) and hero (as did with Chris) out of these crazy suiciders. Can we move away from our morals please and look at the real roots of the problems? Sean Penn presents the movie as a message of wisdom words  Loveetc. and misses the real wisdom of life. Yet the movie is a fantastic viewing that I would highly recommend it.(Stars 8 out of 10)",8,2,5,27 April 2008
Blood Diamond," Blood Diamond
","Blood Diamond I like Leonardo DiCaprio, and I am happy he has done this movie. He gets into the skin of every character he plays, and I like that dedication of his. He has learned and is improving with every challenging performance.Blood Diamond is a typical 70-80's American adventure movie. Such movies are nice to see after a long time, it reminded me of Indiana Jones series, a power packed adventure drama. Only addition this time is that the narrative has more violence in it.Without mentioning the director  Edward Zwick in the beginning of my review, I would be doing disservice. Edward Zwick has punched in enough commercial delight with a human rights (that's what I heard on TV!?) message. Yes, he touches the fringes of critical issues that tingles the mind. The movie casually makes philosophical, political, economic and a few cynical statements especially against American life and thinking. But that does not stop the director to carve out his narrative out of the Hollywood style of story telling.The setting is epic  in the backdrop of Sierra Leone diamond mines and rebel war lords who fight inhumanly for getting a few more diamonds. The story is about Djimon Hounson who finds and hides a big diamond; Leonardo in pursue of the diamond joins hand with Djimon  who now wants to go back to his land to find his son. Jennifer Connelly is a journalist (so typical!!) in search for an expose to illegal diamond trade, who develops a love bond with Leonardo and helps him at crucial juncture.But let me tell you that the story is bit over-stretched, and linking all child soldiers to diamond trade is untrue. Nor the persistent violence of such a heavy shooting and killings on the streets exists amidst environment of normal life. But this is a commercial format  and I think such liberties are permissible.The movie is well made  and scores high on every department of movie making techniques  cinematography, actions, sets, music and above all acting. Leonardo is great, Djimon is terrific and Jennifer is 'American'!! I think the credit of bringing out this story and screenplay should be given to Charles Leavitt, who successfully blends good story (like a typical epic action novel) in a commercial format. There are softer moments in the film, that dwells into and touches intense global issues  but I thought that it fell one or two notches short of hitting bulls eye.If you like Leonardo, go and see the movie  you will love him. And even if you do not like Leonardo, but like good commercial movies go and see the movie, you will like it.(6.5 Stars)",6,0,2,3 February 2007
Taken," Taken
","The name sounds familiarity. Yes, a famous TV series with the same name was there on Aliens, UFO etc. but this movie has nothing to do with the TV series or aliens.The story is about a retired US spy Bryan (Liam Neeson) who is overprotective of his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). Even after cautious NO from Bryan, Kim decides for a trip to Paris with her friend, where both are kidnapped by a European gang of girl traffickers. Before they are sold, Bryan has 72 hours to rescue them. What follows is a ruthless and clinical tracking by Bryan in the streets of Paris. In the end, Bryan is able to save his daughter back.Liam Neeson, though a bit haggard with age, brings immense amount of life to this role of US spy. He is a pleasure to watch when he is at the job he knows and does best, taking risks and always a step ahead of his enemies. He is the heart and soul of this movie. Without him, the movie would not have been as good as it is now.The cinematographer turned Director Pierre Morel, does a fine job with his second venture (this too like his first one Banieule 13 is shot in Paris). The story is linear and is told with clarity. The story builds up slowly but holds your interest till the very end. The action sequences are shot immensely well, and the fights of Liam Neeson reminded me of Steven Seagal's style of martial arts.With Liam Neeson not getting injured till the very end, it was not necessary to show him getting injured during the last fight with a puny fellow. Anyways, it is a good action movie to watch.(Stars 6.5 out of 10)",6,5,8,12 May 2008
The World's Fastest Indian," Burt Munro
","The World's Fastest Indian I had read about this movie about 4 months back when it was released in Amsterdam. I did not see that movie at that time. After that the movie was running in other cities in Holland, where I could not go to see it. So when I got to see this movie in the North West Airlines while traveling from Amsterdam to Sydney  I did not miss this opportunity.At the prime age of 70 this multi talented actor, director, composer, writer, and producer does not stop amazing you with his talent. I am talking of Sir Anthony Hopkins. He plays the role of Burt Munro  a real life old character who took part in World War I, and is staying in eastern corner of a peaceful town in New Zealand. His passion in life is his old Indian motorcycle of 1920s that he is innovating to participate in the American speed racing. The year is 1967, and the story is about Munro's weird ways and eccentric character; his journey from New Zealand to USA and his charm with which he wins hearts of people to give him help and a way to stubbornly participate in the motor speeding event. The movie culminates in an unbelievable thrilling exciting finish.Anthony Hopkins plays this memorable role with ease. The role is so alive that it inspires all of us even in the most painful moments of his old life. When we see him suffering from weak old legs, persisting heart ailments, and breathlessness and sagging body  Munro remains natural and at ease without bothering about such things  rather keeping his focus on the event.There are many different characters who meet Munro along the way to reach the event location - who laugh and doubt at his dream. Each sub-plot of different characters is presented with exact length without making any portions of the film boring.I liked the cinematography - some shots and photography are very well executed. Sadly Anthony Hopkins has not been nominated for any 'Best Actor' category in any awards.Just a few trivia - the director  Roger Donalson - made his debut as a director in a TV series for the same story in 1971, where he played Burt Munro's old character at his prime age of 26. It has been 37 years since then and 16 movies later the Roger at the old of 62 requests 70 years old Anthony Hopkins to make this character immortal on screen  and does he succeed? Yes he does.Last note for our readers  the actual record set up by Burt Munro in 1967 of racing at more than 200 Kms per hour speed by a less than 1000 cc bike still remains unbroken till date after 30 years  and that too Burt Munro used 1920 bike model and he was 58 years old when he set that record.Is not this absolutely amazing and inspiring? Thanks Roger Donalson for bringing back to life Burt Monro through Sir Anthony Hopkins.(Star 7 out of 10)",7,6,6,9 March 2007
The Happening," Intelligent people think they are cheated - the movie is a FRAUD!
","Manoj Night Shyamalan (MNS) evokes a weird feeling inside me. I always expect something unusual and something very different from him. With every movie he presents a concept, that is well thought and presented. I was looking forward to this movie. I saw it today - The movie is about unusual things happening  people loosing thinking, direction and fatally committing suicide - in US, starting from big city (New York) and approaching remote areas of North East US. The indication of something fatal approaching is the direction of wind  the trees shaking and the grass quavering. Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is a science teacher, and he is on a run - from these unusual events - with his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) and his friend's girl child Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez). To avoid death, Elliot tries scientific methodology of analysis, study, interpretation etc. but fails to understand the ways of these happenings. As mysteriously the happenings starts, they end also without any logic, science or reason.In the beginning of the movie MNS brags about science, intelligence etc. and I was thinking what the hell  why is he showing off? Also MNS is upfront  in the beginning he presents the concept of the movie  Not all things can be understood by science and reason. That is the concept and the core of the movie.Most people expect some cause and effect relationship. That is how our minds are trained. MNS presents the concept very casually in the beginning but follows it up diligently till the end. Did he fool the audience? NO. Only that audience who thought they were intelligent  but actually who are not intelligent enough to respect nature and natural events and happenings  did not get it.The movie holds your attention from the beginning till the end. MNS has a great style of presenting his narrative  that engages, builds, and challenges the audiences. Great stuff! He is a master of the medium and his concepts.In an interview he told that this movie is simple  it does not have a twist in the ending. And there is none. Fools mights consider this movie a fraud, but it is brilliant.Mark Wahlberg, Zooey Deschanel and Ashlyn Sanchez have played their part as per the role. The narrative is simple, but edge of the sit.Full marks to MNS! If you have not liked the movie, you must be the one who is falsely considering him/herself intelligent  a scientific person, who requires answers for everything. Let me tell you  there are no answers for many things in life and nature. Earlier learned the better for your intelligence! (Stars 7 out of 10)",7,2,9,14 June 2008
The Departed," The Departed
","I had seen the trailer of this movie when I was in India  during seeing a Hindi movie 'Dor'. At that time I had decide to see this movie. The temptations were many. First, it is a movie made by Martin Soccerer. It has a wonderful star cast  Leonardo Decapirio, Jack Nicholsan and Matt Dillon.I saw to see this movie at Pathe De Munt. I liked the movie a lot. As always the direction was fantastic. The acting  superb! Riveting! Edge on the seat  cat and mouse game between law keepers and law breakers.The story reminded me a bit of an India movie  Ram Balram. In that movie a man adopts two children and trains one as police and the other as robber  so that he can easily continue to thrive in crime. Strangely this movie is inspired and made from a Chinese movie. I was a bit unhappy by hearing his  because I was not able to imagine that Martin Soccerer has to depend on an already made movie.But after saying that Martin Soccerer has done a wonderful job; he has created an edge of the seat thriller, with numerous twist and turn. The trade mark stamp of Martin Soccerer were left on each and every frame  body, gory and violence.The best actor was Jack Nicholsan, followed by Leonardo who is emerging as the best actors in the world. I like his selections of movie and movie directors. It seems that the pairing of Martin and Lenardo is working well.The end twist of the movie was the surprise of Jack Nicholsan being of FBI and pitching criminals in the state police forces. That was interesting. In this movie too I did not like the ending  because Leonardo is killed  but no regrets  because it is Martin's style of film making.After seeing the movie I felt  this is the way to tell stories  which we know is fictional  they are like reading books  that are like dream and fantasies. I would surely like to tell stories like this.A not to miss movie!",7,0,1,7 January 2007
The Holiday," The Holiday
","A perfect release during Christmas and New Year season especially when the backdrop and period shown in the movie coincides with Christmas and New Year. I saw this movie because it was a new release, and the show timing matched the time available for me to see another movie immediately after Perfume.I should compliment the Director - Nancy Meyer who evidently has spent quite a bit of time on the script and churning out dialogues that are precisely written.The story is about two girls who have been cheated by their lovers and want to get over the depression feeling and get far away from men of their lives - swap houses (one in UK and the other in USA) for 2 weeks through an internet exchange houses website. The two girls are Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet  both look gorgeous. The character of Cameron Diaz has more depth in personality but does not come out fully during the movies  but at times Cameron brings them out. Kate Winslet is a beauty to watch  she has a perfectly beautiful face. It is needless to say that the two girls come across two men and fall in love with them, while trying to forget their past affair. The story unfolds slowly and at times you feel are a better editing would have made this movie more enjoyable. The Director tries to show some  but there are no big hic-ups during the journey of these two girls and as audience you already know the ending, and that is why you loose the charm  or the last punch in the end.It is a simple, straight forward love story  a time pass, at times clichéd too. Go and see during Christmas time, you might enjoy it with your better half.",5,0,1,7 January 2007
There Will Be Blood," There will be blood
","There will be Blood The new trend has emerged. Some good movies when released instantly become so highly rated that they break into the top league of IMDb top rated movies. I find that formula very strange that it does not discount the recentness of movie craze wave. This movie is at number 30 in top movies list of all times! Is not it amazing? Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis), an obsessive hard working miner learns and rises to become shrewd oil extracting businessperson  when he is approached by a poor Sunday family with a prospect of selling their oil-filled Texas rural hinterland to him. Daniel presents himself as a social family man by projecting a boy HW (Dillon Freasier) - he has adopted from a dying miner  as his own son. There is Paul Sunday (Paul Dano), an aspiring boy wanting to become a prophet  who wants his vested interest of building a church fulfilled by the richness of Daniel who is using their land. Daniel despises Paul's religiousity. In an accident HW looses his hearing and that presents suttle changes in Daniel's personality of father and businessman. At the end of the movie, Daniel is shown as a grudgy filthy rich old man hating everyone around him. And movie ends up with a climax that is minorly representative of its title  BLOOD.This epic saga is loosely adopted from Upton Sinclair's novel OIL. The young talented director Paul Thomas Anderson, rides big on the mega opus venture and fortunately on the strong and reliable shoulders of Daniel Day Lewis who agreed to do the role with this upcoming director.Even though the movie is a story about several characters  Daniel Day Lewis captures each and every frame of the movie. He brings life to one of the most interesting characters. The physicality that Daniel Day Lewis provides to this role is so enormous that he is like a Demi-God in the art of learning good acting. His eyes, his movements are spell binding.Throughout the movie the character show-case a varied range of emotions  white, gray and dark, and it is so interesting to watch the circumstances that bring out different sorts of characters. But in last 20 minutes, the character becomes totally dark  though good, that becomes one dimensional and not as much appealing as the entire story.The music composed by Jonny Greenwodd is starchy and starkling. Many people have found it mis-placed and out of sync with the movie. I did not find that way. I found the music's presence to be quite conscious and intended.The title of the movie is mis-leading to many movie goers who expect quite a bit of blood, gory and violence in the movie, and what one finds is a trying absorbing (to them slow) narrative on the beautiful terrain of Texas deserts.Overall, a wonderful movie to watch.(Stars 8 out of 10)",8,3,6,8 March 2008
Joker," How much humiliation a psychotic person can take?
","JOAQUIN PHOENIX He re-enacts JOKER with Oomph...Todd Phillips, the director a New York film school graduate, making not so good comedy and funny flicks - gets fed up with defending his crude comedy take on the world that is criticized by many.
that is the time the idea of JOKER is spotted.a comedy - that is psycholtic and dark.
In partnership with Scott Silver - (writer/ director) they write the story of rise of JOKER - the Batman arch-villainI have seen Borat - the story written by Todd. His writing made me think that he writes to provoke and disturb the audience.Todd carries the same under-current in this too - especially in the scenes of absolute violence. He wants people to be disturbed and enjoy the violence so much that they may start celebrating a psychotic crazy man.The justification used is about mirroring the society we live in.The character Arthur Fleck (JOAQUIN PHOENIX) lives with his mother in the eighties Gotham city - which has the downtown dark allies and high crime rate, and corruption - a society that is degraded to its extreme.
All the sympathy that is built for the character is so relate-able that at one point our heart goes out for Arthur - HOW MUCH A PERSON CAN TAKE?
How much a person is subjected to humiliation? What happens if the person is a psychotic? That's what Arthur Fleck is.Todd gives the liberty to Arthur - the JOKER to show the worst part of human nature - to reflect the society we live inThe violence is disturbing - and one with weak senses - may celebrate such violence by imitating it.
Thus the movie does not serve a moral purpose. But it gains at its cinematic value.
The performance of JOAQUIN PHOENIX as JOKER - is spell binding. I have always loved him in all his movies. He gives his all for a role - so close reminder to Robert De Niro -Interesting is that the role was suggested for Leonardo De caprio - but Todd stuck with JOAQUIN PHOENIX and the results are outstandingWith eighties set, and no use of CGX - the movie is basic - except the somewhat jittery camera work.The rise of JOKER to become the nemesis of SUPER hero - was a back-story - which will remain - a WELL TOLDAs much as I am not against LOVE - I am not against violence, but both should not be used as a manipulative tool.
At the end of the movie - we feel that Todd has taken it to extreme and taken the liberty to show us the society we live in.
And if this is the society we live in -
I can only say - LOVE - and conscious LOVE is the only way out
Sadly there is no one to LOVE the JOKERThe movie is getting extreme praise or extreme criticism. Surely JOAQUIN PHOENIX is top for OSCAR race.
It already has fared 5 times its budget of USD 70 million and good for Todd, who wanted a hit.If the violence was handled more aptly - I would have given higher rating, but now I will go with 7.5 out of 10.",7,0,6,10 October 2019
Downfall," The Downfall
","With the interest to see a balanced view of Hitler during the 2008 holocaust week, this movie was recommended by colleague Andreas Hensel.The movie is partly based on the book written by Traudl Junge (Alexandria Maria Lara), the final private secretary of Adolf Hitler (Bruno Ganz) and it narrates the story of the final downfall of Germany to Allied forces. It shows Hitler in a very pensive, defeated mood due to the losses in the war. The movie also shows a more balance portrayal of Hitler (and not one-track characterization) as shown in the other movie Hitler  the Rise of Evil.Bruno Ganz has done a great job in being Hitler. Again like I said for Robert Carlyle who played Hitler in Rise of Evil, it is hard to believe any other person playing the role of Hitler as Bruno has done. Comparison is bound to take place, but both these actors have done justice to their roles  that show different portions of Hitler's life.The over-shadowing dominance of Hitler over his commanders, and the helplessness of the situation the German army was in  worn out, marginalized, defeated  but still fighting, is saddening to see. Hitler was blindly worshipped by Germans, and there were people who literally believed that he is the ultimate savior  the God, and his words are final.Hitler deciding his own suicide rather than surrendering, so that he can be remembered as a great hero  has not lasted in the pages of history, or did not last after the World War II. Today everyone treats him like a monster, and realizes the blunders of the holocaust.An excellent movie by Director Oliver Hirschbiegel. Sadly this movie  though a brilliant one  did not win an Oscar in best foreign film category. I hear that there were people who did not like its nomination too in Oscars.But I still wait for a real balanced portrayal of Hitler in a movie format. Does anyone know of such a movie that exists that I can watch? (Stars 8 out of 10)",8,2,4,12 May 2008
The Last King of Scotland," The King of Scotland
","The King of Scotland This is a story about Idi Amin told from the perspective of his personal Scottish physician. Forest Whitaker has played the role of Idi Amin brilliantly. This is a role for life for any actor and Forest has done ample justice to the nuances of the Idi Amin's character. He has been excellent in portraying varied range of emotions  and that weirdness of the crazy character.James McAvoy plays the young Scottish doctor who in his youthful energy and bashfulness, is liked by Amin and gets sucked into the gruesome events that unfold slowly in the movie. He has done a very good job in showcasing his skills as an actor.But the movie belongs to Forest Whitwaker. He punches each and every shot of his with so much of power and perfection that it is hard to believe that Idi Amin was anyways different from what is portrayed by him. From the most loved leader of Uganda to the most dreaded one  is a deadly journey.As the story is shown from an insider's perspective James as the Scottish doctor is only able to see the real savagery of Idi Amin at the very end of his partnership with Amin.All credit to Kevin Macdonald as a director to makes this movie so tight and interesting from the first to the last frame. The background score jells very well with the narration and sometimes works on its own as a separate character to build tension, events etc. Forest Whitwaker would make Kevin much proud because I think he excels his director's notes, and that is exceptional. It is no wonder that Forest recently won the Golden Globe and International Bafta award and I would loose my confidence on the fairness of Oscars if he does not with the Oscars for the best actor. It will be a shame on the Oscars!Is not that enough for you to go and see the movie? (7.5 Stars)",7,1,2,10 February 2007
American Gangster," Making a hero out of Gangster
","A great star cast, trailer and the time duration of the movie attracted me to go and watch it.It is a true story of a drug lord in 1960-70s America, Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington)  the first African American underworld kingpin. He learns his ropes early in life and manages to source the drugs from Thailand through Vietnam's US war plans bringing back coffins. Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), an honest cop (but dishonest husband entangled in a broken marriage and divorce lawsuit) gets the job of putting an end to the New York drug market. Frank operates with very low profile so Richie is not able to trace him early on, but evidently does  and pins Franks down, who is also under pressure from rival Italian drug mafia and local police. Franks divulges the entire network of corrupt drug chain operating (the largest expose until date) and hundreds are convicted. Frank serves two terms adding to 15 years and comes out of prison in 1991, with no family or money or life.Denzel Washington  with quite similar looks to Frank, was waiting for this role since last 5 years, and when it materialized  in his own style has rendered complete heart and soul to the complex religious but society and people ruining drug lord. Russell Crowe on other side, portrays a more relaxed but real portray of Richie Roberts  very believable. In contrast Denzel's portrayal is larger than life, and the script intends to make a hero out of this terrible gangster  which is sad part of the story.Otherwise, Ridley Scott has done marvelous job in producing and directing the movie. He maintains a tight script  moving between Denzel and Richie's life, and with a long run time, grips you within the first 40-50 minutes. The lead up to the final hour is very interesting.Ridley maintains a 35 mm format for this movie and packs up a lot of 70s style of production  much similar to what one can compare with brown tone filming and a parallel to Scarface.A treat to watch the engaging scene between Denzel and Russell, especially the style with which Denzel shifts the coffee glass! Ahthose scenes would be remembered in history of cinema in good face to face coming of two good actors.(Stars 8 out of 10)",8,0,2,30 November 2007
The Reader," Heart wrenching performance by Kate Winslet
","The story is based in post World War 2 Germany, shown inter-linked in three parts:First part, where a teenage boy Michael Berg (David Kross) falls in LOVE with a young working girl Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winstel) who is double his age. Second, where the boy Michael is a young graduate lawyer and is attending a court seminar where Hanna Schmitz is accused of being a complicit guard at a Nazi prison where 300 people are murdered.Third, where Michael (Ralph Finess) a well established lawyer secretly supports Hanna's 20 year prison sentence and after release when she commits suicide, he fulfills her wish.The first and third part are the most engrossing and entertaining where romance between these two protagonist brims every frame.The main spine of the movie is Hanna's illiteracy that she is ashamed of. During part one - Hanna insist that Michael reads out all story books and novels to her before having sex with her. During part two - Hanna's secretive about her illiteracy during court proceedings lands her in a life-time sentence compared to her other co-guards who only get 2-3 years of jail sentence.In part three - the part one romance of story reading is recreated again when Hanna is in prison - and Michael sends her audio tapes of all the books he had read to her. Through these tapes Hanna learns to read and writes to the extend that she can form a small sentence and send it to Michael. Those scenes are exceptionally executed with tenderness and LOVE. Even a three word sentence of Hanna written to Michael brings tears to our eyes.Michael is shown torn between hating Nazi criminal and his romantic love interest - Hanna. The last scene of Michael and Hanna meeting each other after almost 40 years face to face is extremely heart-breaking. Without saying much Kate personifies her LOVE by screaming through her eyes, body language and hidden emotions that she wants to be with her LOVER Michael who is unwilling to help her beyond a point. This realization leads Hanna to commit suicide.Hanna's character screams at us as audiences for empathy and sympathy and all credit to the master-class performance of Kate Winstel for it - incredibly portrays an Oscar winning role.Apart from these two main characters - other roles are passe. The movie is adapted from the novel by the same name written by Bernhard Schlick who is himself a lawyer and author. The Direction by Stephen Daldry is excellent.A must watchOverall my rating for the movie is 7.5 out of 10.",7,1,1,27 November 2017

To see movies in another country  and experience the cinema hall, the public and culture is a totally different experience.This is an unusual story of super-hero John Hancock (Will Smith)  who is not the typical super-hero that we see in movies. Hancock is a reckless super-hero, always drunk and dis-interested in life. His super-hero action is always costing the Los Angeles city enormous losses. Everyone hates Hancock  even the kids (who normally love super-heros). Here enter a marketing person Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), who convinces Hancock to join correction center and improve his image. Ray's wife Mary (Charlize Theron) does not like Ray and Hancock's friendship. At this point  a story opens up with another Super-hero character. I will not tell you here to spoil sports. Hancock looses his super-hero powers and faces death, but at the end of the movie survives villains.The scale of the movie is big, the actions even bigger. The story line is interesting  but the execution poor. The script has serious flaws. It takes the audience as dumbheads, and there is too much of abusive language for someone to enjoy this kind of movie.At will, the director Peter Berg (the lousy The Kingdom fame) tries to make the audience believe what he is presenting. There are twists and turns in the movie that are foolish to the hilt. I won't go into the details of the big pot holes.Will Smith looks cool  but he carries this arrogant wrenched facial expression throughout  which after some time, becomes difficult to look at.Only fools can enjoy the movie.As Kingdom was bad  this too is a immaturish movie.I go with 3 out of 10 stars  3 stars for its grand scale and Will Smith.(Stars 3 out of 10)",3,1,3,15 July 2008

","Shooter Let me say it in the beginning. The movie is a typical 80's Hollywood action movie. This time the angle of the story is different.The movie tells the story about a retired sniper Bob Lee Swagger  played by Mark Wahlberg (remember The Departed last scene shooter), who is called by Colonel Isaac (Danny Glover) to give expert inputs on protecting US President from sniper attack. Mark is pitched on the other side of the US law by government, CIA and FBI and framed for attempting murder of the US President. Now he has to prove find out the real truth behind his framing, prove himself innocent, and put the corrupt system in place like a Rambo. Kate Mara plays the love angel (it has to be there) of Mark, who like typical Bollywood style is taken hostage in exchange for the Mark to surrender. Michael Pena plays the supportive anchor for Mark in joining the battle against the corruption.There are good action scenes that build up the adrenal, but all that we see is just repetition of what we have seen in numerous movies. The movie is full of clichés. The hero is larger than life. Because he gets shot in the beginning  throughout the remaining movie none of the bullets showered on him touches him! Kate Mara  has she done some plastic surgery on her face or what? Her role is the most loosely written and she tries to show sudden range of emotional changes that is funny! Mark Wahlberg tries to bring to lie the Die Hard, Rambo  one man army image; I should say that he succeeds to a large extend. I just hoped that he story, script and screenplay were tighter. The story is taken from one of the five novels written by Stephen Hunter on the main protagonist character Bob Lee Swagger. I assume that the thrill of the novel must be engaging and representing the scope of making it a movie, but the Director Antoine Fuqua fails to convert the book magic into an interesting movie.Young teenagers might enjoy the movie.(Stars 3.5 out of 10)",4,3,7,15 April 2007
Lord of War," Lord of War
","There was a current story in the news that 'Lord of War' arms trader Viktor Bout arrested in Thailand. This made me interested in seeing the movie that was more or less inspired from 5 such characters of global arms traders like Viktor Bout.Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) is Ukrainian immigrant to US, and finds a niche in dealing with arms supply  first locally and then with big money coming in  goes international / global. He pulls his brother Vitaly Orlov (Jared Leto) to join him. The illegal trade fetches Yuri  good money and richness, a super model as his wife Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan), global trotting from one continent to another  but he looses his brother Vitaly in drugs, makes many enemies, and distanced himself from humanness and morality that even poor kids from Africa using arms to kill each other does not touch his heart. Even though Yuri substantially faces emotional and moral losses  the movie still ends in a note that 'Arms trade is a chic thing to go into!' A very good topic to make movie on, which the New Zealand born writer / director Andrew Niccol has always loved to rake contemporary problematic issues. Surely, this movie throws enough light on arms trade and how it takes place. Where it falls flat on its face is the inter-weaving of Yuri's family life with his business. It is poorly scripted. In addition, he has created a very superficial, one-dimensional character of Yuri, and the screenplay does not give enough scope to the Oscar winning actor Nicolas Cage to give his best. He is good, I would say above average in his role, but nothing extra-ordinary. Jared Leto over-acts. Bridget Moynahan has hardly anything to contribute to the movie.The movie has surely some funny and engaging sequences, like the Boeing landing on remote African mud-tracks, or Russian collapse and the boost in trade etc. but it could have been a lot better.Indian musician A.R.Rahman sold his theme music of the movie of 'Bombay' for a small scene  which sounds so absurd in the scene. Why should Antonio Pinto  the music director of this movie pay such a high price for this theme and put it in a most absurd situation? May be it is creativity of highest level, that we can not understand.(Stars 5 out of 10)",5,0,1,11 March 2008

This week no good movies were released and thus the stage was set for me to go and enjoy this Robert De Niro's third directorial movie.The story is about Edward Bell Wilson's life  from being a poetry student to being a civil servant in World War II, and later called to be part of the CIA (in the second half of the movie). It is a story about being torn between love, family and duty to the country. The movie runs in two parallel tracks one of 1961 and the other of 1940s - with a bit of third track about the childhood of Edward Bell.It movie starts in 1961 with a love-scene recorded by CIA and they trying to trace the origins and unrevealing the secrets behind it. In doing so the story of Edward Bell is told to us  his childhood, his family, his love-life, his marriage, his wife, his son, and most importantly his job. I would not disclose the mystery of the love-scene and spoil your show, yet I would tell you that after the mystery of love-scene is revealed, there is a final note that captures the essence of the movie. I won't tell you that too.I liked the movie. It is technically very well made; it has strong script, tight screenplay, good editing, cinematography, sound-track, production details, art direction, direction and good performance by Matt Damon as Edward Bell who is the central protagonist of the movie.The mood of the movie is somber. I think it was intentional. It is slow paced  but interesting. Once the audiences agree with the aspects of the movie, the movie is enjoyable. Otherwise critically looking  it is laughable at times, and I will tell you why. I have four comments.First, the character of Edward Bell is unreal (I know it is based on true real life character). It is one dimensional and stony.Second, the way the period and people are captured is also unacceptable. Everyone talking in the same tone and mood  does not reflect the periodic richness of emotions it had. One scene stands out as a sore thumb is when our actors are walking on the bombarded side of East Berlin. The scene, music, the people  everything looked staged and characters devoid of anything going on around them talking of Swiss chocolate. That was funny.Third, even though the story and the main character are depicted for a 20-25 year period, the character remains the same in looks. Robert De Niro forgot that by graying a few strands of hair and making the person walk and talk a bit slowing does not depict age. I think he fails miserably in this aspect.Fourth, is Angelina Jolie suffering from some disease? She looked so bony and emancipated due demands of modern beauty that she looks shockingly unbeautiful.The intention of Robert De Niro would be to make a movie for Oscar run, it is a good movie  but not for Oscars this time.(Stars 7 out of 10)",7,2,3,17 March 2007
Parasite," Is PARASITE a Tamil movie remake?
","Apart from Hollywood I like seeing International movies, Iranian, Korean, French, German etc. moviesParasite movie came into news because it won Oscar for best movie. It is the first foreign movie to win the top most prize. With that came the comparison and allegation that it is a remake of a Tamil movie - Minsara Kanna.May be the plot of the movie is taken from Minsara Kanna, but the story is totally different. In Tamil movie which is a comedy - the story is about winning the family of a rich girl whom the poor hero loves, and he brings each member of his family to do a job (similar to Parasite movie) in the girl's family, and there is a happy ending.Whereas in the South Korean movie Parasite is about class divide, the poor family slowly plots to be part of rich family and in the end there is gory violence where the poor family kills off the rich family.I have seen the Tamil movie and I was interested to see the South Korean movie with all the buzz and good reviews it garnered.The Director Bong Joon Ho - has built the sets of houses for both the poor family living down town dirty and dingy basement and rich family living uptown spacious luxurious bungalow.The poor family are shown cunning, smart, clever and shrewd and the rich family people are shown stupid, dumb and ignorant. As the movie progresses - each member of poor family finds a way in the rich family household by forging documents, and sweet talks.The internet is so full with stuff on how the director has taken pain in comparatively portraying small details of poor and rich life styles on the celluloid.The Director also insists on watching the movie without subtitles.Some audiences who may be jealous of rich people - laughed at the way rich people are fooled by poor people. (sour grapes - Inequity and income gap disparity syndrome) But the movie could not drawn a little bit of smirk on my face.
Critics who have lauded this movie say it is rise of socialism against crony corrupt capitalism.The Director Bong has made a stupid movie marketing it as an intelligent thriller, and those who are liking it - makes us doubt today world's sanity. People who rave about this movie must be mentally 'sick' people.They are the real parasites of this world - and not the rich or poor which the director intends to show here.The acting is not good. Th plot and twists are so convenient and predictably dumb. Forcibly inserted vulgarity and terrible violence at the end just to juxtapose the lethargy of a third rate scripting and film-making.The Tamil movie was bad, but the South Korean movie is worse.Anyways - the Director Bong Joon Ho - is smiling on grabbing 241 awards internationally and 4 Oscars. The times we live in...!I go with 3 out of 10 rating.",3,6,12,8 March 2020
Music and Lyrics," Music and Lyrics
","Music and Lyrics I had low intention on seeing this movie, but because of this premier release in Netherlands, and because it had Hugh Grant  I got inclined.Hugh Grant plays an aging pop star with middle aged women's fan following, and waiting for a big break, which is provided by Cora Corman (in silly characterization of a eastern spiritual music icon)  who asks Hugh to write lyrics for her new stage song; and Hugh Grant takes the help of her watering the plants lady  Drew Barrymore to inspire and write lyrics. In turn Hugh and Drew fall in love, as usual there is a misunderstanding that inspires Hugh to write his original lyrics (which was pathetic) for Drew, which he sings on the last stage performance to get Drew back.Hugh Grant is getting and looking haggard and middle aged, but still emits enough charm to act his way through the movie with his style. Drew Barrymore gives a good performance as an open, lively and messy young girl. The music and lyrics of the movie are a big let down, both do not have a touch of immortality in them, and would be forgotten with the movie  could have been better, especially when the name of the movie is 'Music and Lyrics'.This is the second movie (first was Bobby) in recent time I have seen where the eastern spirituality angle is shown in poor light through weird characters who are interested in it. I being an Indian, it is a bit sad to see this depiction. May be it was because the director Marc Lawrence had some hangover of his 'Miss Congeniality' series of comedy take on things.It is an entertaining film  especially for those who like Hugh Grant type of romantic stuff.(Stars 5 out of 10)",5,0,3,11 March 2007
Paths of Glory," Paths of Glory
","With two minds  unsure of whether I should see this 1957 black and white movie or skip it, I settled down to see the movie.This is a movie during the times of World War I, and the battle between France and Germany over a small out post of German army  The Ant Hills.General George (Adolphe Menjou) under political pressures to show results offers a promotion to General Paul (George Macready), only if Gen. Paul succeeds in capturing the Ant Hill post. General Paul agrees and offers a similar promotional offer to Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) to inspire and motivate his already weak and beaten down battalion to charge Ant Hill post and capture it. Colonet Dax tries to execute the order, but fails and looses the battle with many of his men dead or injured. Gen. Paul is disappointed by the battalion (especially Majors and Sergeants) who disobeys his direct orders and wants to set an example for the French army (by executing 100 French soldiers of the battalion). Three innocent soldiers are selected randomly from the battalion for execution. A court martial takes place where Col. Dax unsuccessfully acts as a defence counsel. In the end these three innocent French soldiers are executed in front of the French army by French soldiers.The most poignant scene is the last scene of the movie when Col. Dax walks back to his barracks and finds the comrades of the executed soldiers sitting merrily in the pub laughing and singing  as if nothing has happened.The movie is excellent. It portrays the politics of war, of institutions, of organizations where there are hierarchies and systems of rewards and punishment. Though the movie is more than 50 years old, the movie remains relevant in making a real mockery of today's organisation structures we work in.Reputed director Stanley Kubrick  what praise one can bestow upon him? Few and far between (especially after 50s) but he has delivered great memorable movies for each generations to see and remember.All the actors are top class; especially the charm of Kirk Douglas is irresistible. The shrewdness of Gen. George character is presently excellently  and we find similar evil character around us in every organisation, who can play the game of being pleasing in cunning garbs  every moment.This movie is a small 87 minute marvel that tells and gives enormous insights to the emergence of management organisations directly from ridiculous army ghettos. An outstanding movie that no manager should miss! (Stars 8 out of 10)",8,0,2,12 May 2008
The Queen," The Queen
","In my quest in searching for good movies running in Amsterdam, I selected this new movie that is critically acclaimed and appreciated by all.I saw this movie at Pathe Tunishchi Theater.When the movie started and about after 30 minutes later I was trying to rate this movie  I gave it 4 Stars out of 10. The reason was because I found the movie too shallow  too current. It showed 2 characters of recent times  The Queen of England and the President of UK  Tony Blair. For me, it seemed comical, to make movie on recent living characters. Because it had all the chances of mis-representing thoughts and events  that would not have been interpreted in the way the Director has shown us. In the beginning 30 minutes or so  the director was trying to take a shot at making the laughing stock of the Queen's monarchy and their ways of life. The character of Queen, the King, Prince Charles and Tony Blair  seemed to me quite caricatured  almost like comic strip. I was not at all impressed by the first part of the movie.But the movie started to grip me  as it progressed. Michael Sheen has acted fantastically as Tony Blair. But the stealer of the show was Helen Mirren, who put her heart and soul in portraying the emotional turmoil the Queen faces. The pride and arrogance and the humiliation and sadness, was projected with royal touch of smile, poise and confidence by Helen. She may surely bag this years top actress Awards at various awards ceremonies.The movie shows how the media  after Diana's death  projects the Royal family as villains  and creates public pressure on the royal family to react to Diana  who no longer is part of their Royal family. Traditionally they need not react  but in today's changing world it is the job of Tony Blair  who is People's Voice  to make the Queen understand what to do to survive in respect of people's memory. The Queen goes through waves of emotional humiliation reflected brilliantly by Helen by her subdued eyes and emotions.The best scene that I like and would love to remember is the scene when the Queen's Jeep's axel is broken and is in the midst of no-where in her 400 acres of Palace area, and encounters a Royal Stag  who is being driven and chased to be hunted by her own grand sons  sons of Prince Charles and Diana. She sees her suffering in the Royal Stag. And the killing of Royal stag reflects the director's vision of killing of all the Royalty that was left of the Queen. The poignant scene was very delicately handled when the Queen on hearing the killing of Royal Stag wants to go and pay her last tribute to it. The decorum with which Helen has handled that scene is brilliant.And thus, by the end of the movie  I change my rating.",7,1,2,7 January 2007
1408," 1408
","The movie attracted me because of 2 reasons  Samuel Jackson and Stephen King.The story is about an author Mike Enslin (John Cusack) who does not believe in ghosts and as part of his search to see ghost, his work is to go and stay in haunted hotels so that he can write books like '10 nights in haunted hotels'. Mike selects a famous New York Hotel Dolphin; room number 1408 to spend a night. The reason is, in that hotel 56 people have died in past 40 years, and nobody has survived for more than 1 hour in the hotel room. Mike Enslin checks in the hotel and experiences ghost, but survives the 1 hour.The build up to the movie was good. But once John Cusack is inside the room and the Director Mikael Hafstrom starts using usual gimmick and tricks to scare the audience, the movie falls flat on its face. Personally I did not find a single scene in the movie that was scary. There was no suspense too in the unfolding of the story. Whatever happens is so expected that I did not experience any thrill.John Cusack shows some signs of good acting, but he is not able to rise above the poor scripting.Samuel Jackson was playing the minor insignificant role of Hotel Manager - Not much to write about any department of the movie.If the purpose was to scare the audience with ghost experience, the director fails in scaring audience. The movie according to me is a dud! (Stars 2 out of 10)",2,9,17,5 September 2007
Iron Man," Iron Man
","I did not have any expectation from this movie, especially after seeing the trailers a couple of times. I had thought  the same usual stuff, and had reminded me of Transformers, gadgets etc. which I do not like.But when I settled down in the movie hall, within first 20 minutes, I started enjoying what was going on.A genius arms industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is kidnapped by terrorist in Afghanistan and asked to make the deadliest weapon for them; Tony instead makes the Iron shield that would help him to escape from the clutches of terrorists. He succeeds. Back in US, he realizes the big dis-service he is doing to the world by designing and selling arms. Against the wishes of his industrialist partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) he decides to stop the company and he designs the Iron Man suit. Once ready, he fights the terrorist, but faces a new enemy in Obadiah who designs a similar giant Iron suit. The last fight is between our real life hero Iron Man and this giant Iron Man.Robert Downey Jr. is the most unlikely hero material for such a role. He is middle aged, does not look suitable for such a heroic role. But surprise, surpriseit is only because of Robert Downey Jr. that the movie becomes watchable. He is a great actor, and brings the extra punch to the persona of Tony Stark, that it is hard to imagine anyone else in his shoes.The movie is a fantasy movie and so everything is tolerated  no question asked. But it is entertaining. The movie thrills and has right amout of humor and action to keep you entertained. The Iron man suit is really cool and convincing enough to believe what all things it can do.It was interesting to hear the terrorist in Afghanistan talk several languages, one of them was Urdu  Hindustani. Interesting! A good entertainment..I enjoyed it a lot, and I am happy that a new series of Iron Man would start with this movie. I am also happy to learn that this movie is doing very well at the box office  not to the happiness of the detractors who did not bet on this Iron Man. But this Iron Man has arrived and is here to stay.(Stars 6.75 out of 10)",7,1,2,12 May 2008
Casino Royale," Casino Royale
","I went to see this latest Bond movie at Pathe De Munt. I went in the morning show at 10:00 am and was not accepting many people in the theatre, but surprisingly there were more than 35-40 people in the hall.I knew that the movie had a new Bond. And recently I had seen a beautiful movie called 'The Mother' on the VCD, in which Daniel Craig was the hero. I had liked him in that movie. I liked his acting. I liked his charm. I found him too good looking. I read somewhere that Daniel Craig is a gay  I do not know whether this is true or not, but that did not deter me at all in getting impressed by him, and look forward to seeing in Casino Royale.I loved the movie. I loved the new Bond. The movie turned everything upside down that someone associates with Bond movie. This movie was not a James Bond movie. It was a love story. This movie did not have the high fly gadgets. It was simple. The Bond was someone who gets beaten, is tested at every stage, have moments of death seeing him in the face, a Bond who is ditched by the girl. A Bond who recognizes that 'he has a very short life expectancy', a very poignant and touching dialogue every told by Bond on screen.This is the first Bond who has a truly great body and who is sensitive and can ACT.The most famous dialogue  'My name is Bond, James Bond' is told at the end of the movie  as the last punch line. This Bond rocks, and leaves me eagerly waiting to see the new Bond movie  hopefully it would be made soon.Later I heard that this Bond movie was made from the first Bond novel and thus has basic stuff  the first years of Bond that grounded the making of real Bond that we have seen since last 30 years. The film showed the beginning of making of Bond's character. Hopefully for a new Bond  Daniel Craig!",6,0,1,7 January 2007
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Elizabeth: The Golden Age
","I have not seen the first part of Elizabeth, but was interested to see this one. I read the reviews on IMDb and they were on such extremes  from love it to hate it; very rarely something in between.The story is about Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett) the queen of Britain in sixteenth century. There is religious war between Catholic and Protestants. Spain (a catholic country) wants to attach Britain (a Protestant country) with the help of France, overturn Elizabeth's rule and install a Catholic queen Mary Stuart (Samanthan Morton). In the meantime, Princes from various countries come with marriage proposals to the virgin queen. The queen gets attracted to Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) who robs Spanish ships, but he marries the queens' closest maid. In turn of events Mary Stuart is beheaded for planning to murder Elizabeth. Spain and France ships attach Britain. With the help of Elizabeth, minister Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffery Rush) and Sir Walter Raleigh Britain's army defend the borders.The movie starts with highlighting the core subject and like Bollywood movies dwells in comedy and romance in the first half, and emotions and drama in the second half ultimately ending with a fight sequence. A typical masala fair by Indian Director Shekar Kapoor (whose name remains hidden from all promotional and marketing materials of this movie  a case of discrimination? I don't know!) Cate Blanchett has given a tremendous performance with the range of emotions that she exhibits. As a general rule, public and political figures normally carry an expression-less face so not to convey their thoughts to anyone. But this queen Elizabeth was overly expressionist. For me sadly it looked more melodramatic than it usually should be.People who do not know details of history  would find this movie an entertaining, because it tries to present the historical plot in commercially viable manner. Otherwise, the movie and the behavior of characters may look stupid to say the least.Geoffery Rush is worth mentioning for his loyal characterization and immense acting skills. Clive Owen looks fabulous and acts well too! Both the writers of the film, William Nicholson and Michael Hirst  picked up from TV careers and given opportunity to work in a major international flick, try their best to fit a historical plot in a Bollywood story format.The photography and costume are very good. The sets authentic. Surely contender for nominations in various categories.If you close your eyes to minute readings of history, you can just sit back and enjoy this masala fair!

Live Free or Die Hard," Live Free or Die Hard 4.0
","I loved Die Hard  Part 1, and then came part 2 and 3; which I think were not as good as part one. After 12 years this is Die Hard  Part 4, most probably the last one! Before I outline the story let me tell you that the movie is not in the usual cinema print format. It is in computer  high graphics digital format. And it shows in high contrasts and sharper lines, which is not so good visually. The story is - BruceWillis as John McClane has aged with a grown up daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth) who hates her dad. A former FBI guy Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) strikes terror on USA through his computer / IT skills  and brings USA to standstill by attacking all major computer operated networks. The main aim is to get access to the Social Database so that he can bankrupt USA by then transferring all bank savings. There is one wiz kid Matt Farrell (Justin Long) who, after being part of the hacking team, survives (Thomas kills all the other geeks). Now it is the responsibility of John McClane to bring Matt to FBI office. Thomas captures Lucy and John goes behind him with his dare devil stunts and one liners to rescue his daughter and USA.The movie is full of mind-less action from beginning till end. The actions have become bigger. The settings from Die Hard 1 (which were indoors) have grown to outdoors. Bruce Willis has more deadly falls and beatings than before. Justin Long has overacted throughout as computer geek (may be some of them are like that in real life too!) The bad guy Timothy suddenly (as all bad guys in movies do) become morons in the end, the ones who no longer remain deadly and can not think straight.I was reminded of 1970s Bollywood movies, where the villain would always capture a family member / friend of the hero (in this movie both are captured) but does not kill anyone of them, instead talks with them till the villains are killed by our hero.The action is visually great to see  it is just mayhem. Throughout the movie, the face of Bruce Willis often becomes clean of blood stains and the stains re-appear and disappear now and then.The young Director Len Wiseman has handled the huge responsibility quite aptly in taking such a big project  with just a little experience in Directing (2 movies). His former experience of art department (Independence day, Godzilla, Men in Black) shows in the sets and scale.Overall it is a good action film. Great viewing for the Die Hard fans!

Munich," Munich
","After re-locating myself to Amsterdam, I have slowly developed an interest in understanding Europe, Jews, issues surrounding Jerusaleum and Palestine  listening and watching different viewpoints (mainly on CNN and BBC). I read in one of my Google searches that Munich was a movie that was discussed and debated a lot on many blogs about its stand on Palestine and Israel. With new Indiana Jones releasing this week and the commonality between them being Steven Spielberg, I decided to have a look at Munich  a movie I had missed while it was released for the first time.The story line is simple  Avner (Iric Bana) is chosen by Israel government to eliminate the masterminds of 1972 Munich Olympics massacre done Palestine terrorists. Avner gets enough money and freedom to do whatever he wants to eliminate the people. The whole operations is planned to be done undercover without anyone knowing about the motives or purposes of the operations. Avner hires four other persons (one of them is Daniel Craig) and the movie rolls into the planning and execution parts of seven out of eight killings - one after the other. There are intermittent discussions within this group on political issues and difference between Israel and Palestine. In the end Avner finds his team being target of elimination and when he is the only surviving member of his team, he thinks they were used as a pawn in the big political game which does not help or benefit anyone.The movie is based on the book: Vengeance  The story of an Israel Counter Terrorist Team. It seems that Director Steven Spielberg invited four script writers and collated Tony Kushner and Eric Roth's scripts to make the movie.Iric Bana is very good in the movie; he is so handsome and has acted also well. Daniel Craig is okay in the small role.The movie focuses more on the execution of murderous attacks rather than the Israel  Palestine issue. So it is a big let down for those who looked up to Steven Spielberg to provide an interesting and intelligent take on it. What we see is a run of the mill, commercial take by Steven Spielberg. May be that was his intention. For me it became evident that the director wanted to project human face of the counter terrorist Jew sqaud  where they delay the killings because of some humane reasons. There were also many pro-Jew statements, and a few con-Jew statements were so disguised that one can easily miss them. I get a feel that Steven Spielberg was a big scared of the Hollywood Jews lobby.I read that many Jews who wanted Steven Spielberg to take a strong pro-Jew stand took objection to this run of mill movie. I also found last sex scene of Iric Bana with flashback of Munich killing  so corny and 'B' grade.Overall a good entertaining movie  if one does not expect intellectual discussions around it.(Stars 6.75 out of 10)",7,0,0,3 June 2008
300," 300
","300 I had heard that 300 looks like a video game. I have never played a violent video game, so I do not know whether this is true or not, but irrespective of that the movie stands on its own feet with no overt resemblance to a video game, until told by someone.The story is simple. In 480 BC, Sparta  a small kingdom in Greece defends the attack by Persian might with 300 soldiers called Spartarians; who die but unite Greece to fight the Persians. It is based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller.Zack Snyder the director of the movie has successfully created a graphical canvass suitable to the novel and maintains a painting look with high contrast  blue and brown colors and hue that create a feeling of every scene being a piece of art. Zack has also co-written the screenplay and there he has failed to recreate the historical context of the time. There are several drawbacks to the film, namely; the dialogues lack punch (and are sometimes laughable), the softer scenes even though having the silence lack depth, and the most jarring one is the contemporary and political context hinted in the movie that disturbs and stands out as a sore thumb.Gerard Butler plays the role of the King Leonidas of Sparta with perfection. The remaining casts are okay and no special mention is required. The battle scenes are shot amazingly but are violently graphic. Astonishingly with all the blood splattering around in the battle the bodies of warriors and the ground always remain without a drop of blood on them. Zack should had noticed and painted this detail inside.Overall a good experience to see a different type of visual movie; the director could have made it much more better than it is now with a better adaptation.(Stars 5.5 out of 10)",5,3,6,31 March 2007

Also I wanted to see the movie with a small child, and Gina  my office colleague and a good friend of mine in Amsterdam  agreed to bring her child for the movie. It was also Christmas time and I thought that it would be good to see this movie.It was a story of a penguin that cannot sing, but can dance. He goes to find the solution of why the penguins are going hungry and who is stealing their fish and lands up in a zoo, but is shipped back to its homeland where all the penguins dance to impress the human race  not to fish near penguin habitats. The message is very good; to protect the environment. The human race is shown as very considerate in keeping the concerns of penguins at heart.My expectations were high because of rave reviews the movie received. I liked the movie; I will not say I loved it in totality. What I loved about the movie was its creation of life like images of penguins. I could imagine the amount of detailing that had gone into its production. It was incredible  hats off to the director and production team, after a long time I saw something really good in cartoon characters.The movie had all the aspects of emotions and drama in hold interest. Overall an okay feast during Christmas for children to see.",5,0,0,7 January 2007
The Pursuit of Happyness," Pursuit of Happiness
","The Pursuit of Happiness I had to google the name 'Christopher Gardner' after seeing the movie. Because the movie is inspired from his life  a true story! Christopher Gardner is a associate producer along with Will Smith of this movie. It has been just 8 months since the autobiography hit the US markets  that people are able to see its movie. That was quick I say  a good marketing and investment on trying to make oneself immortal on screen. Well done Chris Gardner.Before I write the review  I would like to say that the concept of 'Happiness' is so different in western society. Trying to be something or someone (one dreams of) to be HAPPY!?? Is that happiness? I do not understand that part. But the movie gives a message  'Chase your dreams and be happy!' Does not it sound like an American cliché? Yes it is  so is the movie.Will Smith plays a 'High density resolution X-Ray machine' sales person in San Francisco, who is in pursue of THE happiness that he sees on people's faces. He lives a drudgery life, in a shabby small apartment and wants to take decent care of his son  Jaden Smith - when his wife, Thandie Newton, leaves him without any earnings, without a place to stay but a DREAM to make it big some day.The whole movie is about his struggle - till the very end when he passes and is selected by a stock broker firm.The way the character is shown facing one ordeal after another, I could not stop thinking that - is this character stupid or dumb or both? I know that many people face much harder challenges without chasing called 'dream'. Knowing that fact - I did not feel much empathy for the character because a lot looked self created to me. But I got the point the movie is trying to make  and I realized it when the tears started rolling my eyes when it is told that Chris has got a job. It was worth all the trouble going through to achieve that happiness. Today Chris Gardner is one the most respected self made entrepreneur in US.The movie making is perfect. I liked the outdoor shots of San Francisco skyline that are taken wonderfully. It is Will Smith's movie all the way. Jaden Smith and Thandie Newton as son and wife have also done a decent job.The amount of time Will Smith is shown running in the movie is crazy. For every other occasion he starts running! Good effort  imagining the number of takes each shot would have taken during rehearsals and filming.A good 'feel good' movie  that would surely inspire many African Americans to dream big.Just a trivia  for the first time in Amsterdam, I saw more than 20 per cent of the audience from African origin. Will Smith seems to be popular among them and a current running comedy series on UPC channel of a much younger Will Smith is another proof of the same.(6 Stars)",6,1,1,4 February 2007

","I have been looking at the top 100 movies list of IMDb and it is becoming so disappointing. The top 6 movies are of crime, murder, action and mafia. Casablanca is the only movie that is of its own category standing out alone at 7th place; but this time I at looking at GoodFellas at spot 17 - all time great movies.The story is based on true events and characters from a novel named 'Wise Guy' written by crime reporter Nicholos Pileggi. It is about this boy Henry Hill born (Ray Liotta) in 1943 in a poor working class family who wanted to be in a gang since his boyhood because that gave him freedom, money, and respect from people. He joins hands with Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) and Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro). This trio starts by hijacking, stealing and selling goods from huge truck loads. Once arrested Hill starts dealing in drugs in prison and when out continues to do so. In the end, with difficult times, of police after him, with new enemies and having difficult times with his wife Karen (Lorriane Bracco)  he decides to be an informant to avoid prison sentence and gives in most of his gangster friends  good fellows! The movie is directed by Martin Scorsese, who like Tarantino has earned his reputation with cold blooded killing of people and mafia movies. He directs the movie well in all departments and combines with ample social, family and drama scenes to balance the dark narrative.All the actors have acted well, but the best in the lot is Joe Pesci who has played the weird cranky character of Tommy with such conviction that it should be remembered just for its sheer portrayal of characteristics. Ray Liotta who gets to play the central character is okay and his career till date shows that he has lost himself into mundane small roles. Robert De Niro is as good as ever and shows his brilliant insight to understanding deep dark characters  he loves to play.The movie progresses from 1950 till 1980s and Martin captures all those eras with much ease and details.Even though his movie is in the top 20 list - lately, seeing many of these mafia movies  I do not feel that much excited. It has become routine and mundane for me to watch the cold killings, glorifying killings, blood everywhere  showing crazy characters who pull out gun at any point to shoot someone. I feel sick at times for the world and the good directors who have not got over showing it on big screen.Just a trivia, Henry Hill is still alive but suffering depression and fighting alcoholism and spends most of his time in rehab centers.(Stars 7 out of 10)",7,4,8,4 August 2007

This all lead me to see the movie  despite the fact that my boss  when asked how is Atonement  after a 5 second pause  said, um.meaning  not so good.The story is set around the decade of world war II. Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan), jealous of her sister Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley) love affair with Robbie Turner (James McAvoy); accuses Robbie of being a sexual perverse and raping her friend. Robbie is sent to prison and after 5 years, sent to serve the army in WWII. Grown up Briony (Romola Garai), serving as a nurse, despairs her lies and as part of atonement apologies to Robbie and sister Cecilia, but it is too late for Cecilia and Robbie to unite.The movie is based on the popular novel written by Ian McEwan by the same name. The adaptation is synched in four parts  the first part of summer where Briony falsely accuses Robbie, the second part of WWII - Robbie serving the army, the third part of nursing  and atonement of Briony; and the fourth and final part of Briony's interview of the autobiographical novel.The first part winds up slowly  as slowly as the British rural summers. It is wonderfully shot and as audience, one gets the feel of the real summer. This part is the most interesting because of the romance between Robbie and Cecilia. The army part of heavily funded and created, but is loose and does not build up the interest. While the nursing part is slowly un-winding of the mind of Briony, who recognizes and waits for her atonement.I liked the first part the most. James McAvoy is the best thing in the movie, he brings to himself  so easily the boyish charm, and the vulnerability of an accused man, that his performance is worth noticing. One more cap after The Last King of Scotland. Keira Knightley has acted very well, but what on earth she has become? Like a walking stick  just bone and sticking flesh? Uh..what the world has come to be, defining her as the most sexiest and beautiful women. People must be really mad, and out of their minds.The role of Briony was the strongest and is the 13 year old Saoirse Ronan renders with great punch and epoch, while the grown up role by Romola Garai  even though having depth, does not touch you or does not even leave an impression. A lot remained in the part three of the movie.The best parts of the movie were the cinematography by Seamus Greenwood and the musical score by Dario Marianelli, which was near to brilliant  especially the type writers strokes and that turning into music, with a slight synch with the character's tap of fingers or crossing of door. Brilliant! But overall movie experience, it leaves a lot more to be desired. Director Jeo Wright could have made it a much better movie, with the amount of talent and money available to him. Jeo was too detailed in dwelling into the era of three parts and missed out on the gripping narration.A chance of good movie lost, but not that bad.(Stars 5.5 out of 10)",5,13,25,15 December 2007
