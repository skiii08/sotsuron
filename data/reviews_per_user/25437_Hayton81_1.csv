Requiem for a Dream," Wow!
","This is the kind of movie that will send a chill down your spine! The movie was a shocking portrayal of drugs and their effects on one family. The entire cast, especially Ellen Burstyn, did a fantastic job in making this movie believable. The creative and innovative cinematography and shot angles makes this movie very unique. Definitely one of the best independent films of the year.",8,0,0,2 June 2001
