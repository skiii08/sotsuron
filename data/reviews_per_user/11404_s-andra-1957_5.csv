Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," Absolute Geniuses in this fantastic movie
","Jack Black always a delight is beyond fantastic with Kyle Gass's brilliance this movie is the finest of rock operas I've had the delight to see! It's an Epic production with great cameo performances David Grohl's Satan, Tim Robins Stranger, and Meat Loaf Bud Black plus so many more! Each cast member does such a brilliant job I couldn't count the number of awesome music spots and hilarious jokes but the whole thing was pure genius! This is a fabulous piece of work sit back and enjoy this master piece!",10,0,0,9 April 2020
Mudbound," An absolute gem!
","I loved this film. Rob Morgan was just amazing! He was an awesome father, preacher, black man living in a time of complete racism. You cannot but feel for this characters hopes and dreams and for that of his children. His son played by Jason Mitchell is a decorated Sargent who was a tank operator. In Europe where he is not segregated he falls in love with a white woman, but has to come home from the war. Jonathan Banks is brilliant as ever, creating a truly awful racist! His sons having vastly different upbringings one on the farm and the other as a bomber pilot in the Second World War are in complete opposition. His friendship with Jason Mitchell's character is understandable as their shared war experiences. The women in the movie are strongly quiet behind the scenes but the three main ones Carey Mulligan,Mary J. Blige, Lucy Faust are simply stunning in their intensity! This movie is an absolute gem and definitely Oscar worthy! Loved this and yes recommend it!",10,1,1,30 March 2020
Marriage Story," Well acted
","This movie was well acted! I just found it too boring for me. The argument where Adam Driver punches the wall was very real, set against the lawyers greed and bad advice makes this a good movie.",5,3,9,15 February 2020
Flight," Brilliantly acted
",Kelly Riley is so sweet in this film. Denzel is fantastic! I'm a big fan of Denzel who can convey so many things with his acting it was so lovely to watch this film as people try to regain themselves! Brilliantly acted by all!,10,0,1,25 March 2020
