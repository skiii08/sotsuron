The Equalizer," Don't Eat Pringles or Other Junk Food!
","What's not to enjoy? A great-looking African-American protagonist, played with intelligence, grace and wit by Denzel Washington, who is unassuming but very, very clever, concerned about what he and others put into their bodies by way of food, erudite, fastidious and committed to righting situations for a few decent acquaintances trying to improve their lives against long odds. This guy thinks outside the box when up against Russian mafia evil-doers and is merciless in inflicting punishment for bad deeds. As others have said, it is comic book violence and very gruesome at times. But there is still creativity in the execution in keeping with the savvy of our hero. Two hours of pure entertainment.",8,1,8,30 September 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Very Boring--No Satisfaction
","The subject of the film is a tawdry fellow whose antics earned him substantial wealth and a lavish lifestyle for a time but his adventures are not interesting enough to sustain a film of any length and certainly not one that runs for three hours. About a half hour in, I lost interest in the shallow and manic characters and their clearly foreshadowed repetitive and unfunny trajectories. The sex, drugs and moral shallowness quickly turned to boredom and the minutes passed slowly. The only relief came as the credits started to roll! What was Mr. Scorsese thinking? Wolf is a dud on almost all counts and I now understand why it earned a relatively rare C CinemaScore. Word of mouth will not keep this in theaters for long.",3,18,36,1 January 2014
