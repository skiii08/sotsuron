Hereditary," What did I just watch?!
",This movie had me processing its content for quite a while after the end credits. It was dramatic and slow at first slowly building to something so grotesque that I was both terrified and amused at the director's bold choices. The overall feeling at the end was: 'what the heck did I just watched?' I recommend this movie for both lovers of horror and independent style cinema.,8,1,4,20 June 2018
Joker," It's so real it's uncomfortable but in a good way...
","This film left me intrigued and fascinated by its sheer power and emotional tone. This is by far one of the best and darkest versions of hero movies taken to the next level. Gritty and real in a way other DCU or MCU stories have never been told or could be expected to do so. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar for this performance. without a doubt; his portrayal of the character of Arthur a mentally ill down trodden man having the worst day ever which throws him over the edge, manages to touch the soul and fears of every member of the audience who will undoubtedly leave the theatre with an uncomfortable sense of unsettledness.",10,3,6,21 October 2019
