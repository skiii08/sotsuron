Child 44," It irritates me that this movie was down voted by some.
","Spectacular movie i felt every emotion from each character, it captured a grim life under an oppressing regime amazingly you can sense everyones fear and despair. Their Russian accents weren't bad either, of course it would've been more perfect if they could fluently speak Russian but that isn't possible the English/Russian accent was good. Definitely would recommend watching that movie, its fun, thrilling and unpredictable. Tom Hardy was as always amazing in his portrayal of Leo, i think they missed out just a little bit about his relationship with his wife, could've showed us more of it, I hadn't read the book to be honest so i don't know if it was written in depth within the book's pages. Still the actress who played his wife did an amazing job as well.",7,4,10,24 July 2015
