The Lobster," Best movie I've seen lately
","...SARCASM...I rather watch a van-Damme blockbuster movie, it's much more entertaining and psychological that this one. I'm not sure what's going on in the US or what's the vision of the Screen Writer about real world people relationships that this movie tries to imply. Sure, the society is quite sick and gets worse now-days but people relationships will probably never get near the play of this movie, at least for normal human-beings. Yet, if I'm looking at some societies, of how some people treat each other, sure, you can put it this way if you like. However the entire message could've been played in like 10 minutes or less with a higher impact. I personally lost some precious 2 hours of my life by watching this. It was so boring with so many 'WTF am I watching' moments (one of them being the torture of the poor animals and why not people) that I'm not sure what was in the director's head. I think a 10 y/o kid could've done better. The ending is as 'exciting' and obvious as the rest of the movie.",3,2,2,4 January 2017
