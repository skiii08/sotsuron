Whip It," Teenage girls can kick-ass too.
","Every entry in an already tired indie formula, brings us closer to actually returning to the age of teenage-hood. Reverting mentally to the point where we were desperately seeking of our own, repressed inner-selves. Whip It does something differently though. It sparks a frightening nostalgia for that flaming youth that actually, might be still buried deep within and provokes a thought: why I don't remember my teenage years as being so much fun?It might be a rite of passage, coming of age story in its purest form and Bliss (Ellen Page) is, inevitably, a troubled and too often embarrassed, teen stuck in Boden, Texas. She struggles between satisfying her demanding mother (Gay Harden) and managing a straight face in a pink apron of a diner where she works. It all changes when, god given, she attends a women's roller derby and joins the worst team in the league. Beauty peagents, she is forced to attend are replaced with bruises, sweat and, well...tight, green uniforms. But only until Bliss' parents learn of her daughter's new hobby.Ellen Page, as you would expect, channels a lot of her Juno stamina here. And it's definitely a kind of a cocky and bright performance you would expect. But with Bliss, Page manages some new depths. This time around script allows her not to outwit everybody: 'Are you alternative now?' asks her bitchy, school nemesis. 'Alternative to what?'. This wonderful disillusionment and total confusion about one's place in life makes Whip It so special and so darn cute. Bliss is forced into her cynicism by her ambiguous habitat but she manages a believable vitality. Page's charisma grinds on both her skill and script's natural humour. Whip It's greatest strength lies perhaps in the way all of the characters come together. Juliette Lewis, Zoe Bell (of a Death Proof fame), Eve and Drew Barrymore herself in supporting roles, make this film feel like a genuine fun. Girl-power chemistry they spark, create a ground for unbelievably enjoyable story where nothing can really go wrong. Barrymore's début might often be formulaic but it never loses its charm. She firmly holds all the strings together and its difficult not to cheer those lousy skaters on. Once the competition reaches its climax it is your purest, edge of the seat, nail-biting drama.It's ultimately a shame that Whip It never aspires to anything bigger and bolder. It's so good in its own game and Barrymore such a promising new-coming director, that you'll regret that she never tries anything more adventurous. Ultimately, the only other complaint is purely technical and if you're already planning to skip on the sports-induced excitement in favour of the spiritual journey, even irrelevant. But camera work way too often seems to stay well behind Page and other skating girls in the derby sequences and you might find yourself lost.True, a lot of Whip It will sound like a broken, old record and parts of it reek of clichés. Bliss' strongly polarized family often balances on the edge of a ridiculous emotional mess that's just a tad too stereotypical even for an indie taste. And a rock-band singer love affair could be skipped altogether, without any harm to the film's outcome. But Barrymore approaches Cross's script (adapted from her semi-autobiographical novel) with a tenderness and adolescent wit. In the end it sounds real and is warm-hearted but is also pulsing with a rock'n'roll energy.Verdict: Whip It might be of small proportions but highly substantial and thoroughly entertaining. Even if it won't make you grab your old skates and go embarrass yourself, it will definitely provoke a smile of deeply grounded satisfaction. Barrymore's follow up to this début is now much anticipated. Whip It in a tagline? Juno on skates. With a kick-ass boost.4/5",8,0,3,3 July 2010
The Best Years of Our Lives," Classic post-war epic.
","A huge commercial success of Wyler's film upon its release right after the war and a spectacular critical reception (9 Oscars including Best Picture) are surprisingly conflicting (and somewhat symptomatic of the film's value) when one determines his expectations towards a picture that suggests post-war revisionism encapsulated within the spirit of the Classical Hollywood melodrama. The Best Years of Our Lives is a complex film in a sense that it is intricately honest about its political restraints and yet applies the same careful consideration to both the entertaining dramatic facade and underlying it social context.Running time of over 170 minutes turns The Best Years of Our Lives into a 'domestic epic'- film of subtle pleasures and intervening relationships focused on the mundane but extended into the proportions usually reserved for stories of much more grandiose scale. Yet initially balanced perspectives shift dangerously and for lengthy periods of time character of Homer is pushed into the background. Played by an actual disabled veteran, Homer adds a level of harsh realism that is unexpected for a Hollywood film of that period. All three veterans, levelled only briefly by a shared anxiety of returning to their families are constantly challenged by their different economical positioning, but strangely disproportionated by the narrative's momentum.Wyler's film reveals itself to be a melodrama, in most natural way evolving from the struggle for readjustment into a love affair and it thrives on sentimentality. This notion dominates the tone of the whole with a pleasurable alas predictable manner, leading to an ending that seems to be entirely satisfied with its shmalzy quality. Film is simply most comfortable in this familiar territory, once the obstacle of the controversy- Al's contradictory intentions at work, Fred's unemployment and Homer's disability become merely a set up. At one point Homer's sacrifice comes under blunt questioning but the villainous gentleman who dares to display his doubt is brutally dispatched- questionable necessity of war dismissed in favour of the future prosperity; an optimism of blindfolded conformity. This suspension of criticism is film's dominant mode.Staged and executed with precision, film utilizes, infamously, deep focus to achieve a level of undeniable verity. It is hard to dismiss it as only a technical nuisance and although one should be extremely careful to seek Bazinian inclinations of dominance in this particular form, The Best Years of Our Lives is a thoroughly impressive achievement. Depth of every shot provokes a curiosity that is often rewarded through reoccurring use of reflections and significant details that would otherwise require editing, disturbing film's considerate pace.Verdict: It's a classic that is as enjoyable a movie now as it might have been in 1946 but even more interesting as a story of a significant compromise. One between the urge for reassessment in a mass medium not quite ready for this kind of impact and a story that could support the interest of a broad audience- disillusionment and patriotism. More a mark of its times than perhaps any other Classical Hollywood venture, The Best Years of Our Lives is an example of a film that lost none of its excellence and purely emotional impact even if it intellectually resonates in a rather underwhelming way.",9,1,1,10 April 2011
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Millions of fans can be wrong.
","Third instalment in The Twilight Saga manages to suck dry what was left of the potential for a good movie after the New Moon fiasco and also any interest left in the casual audience, in how the story will conclude in the next, final chapter of the franchise.Nothing has changed since the previous film and the opening brings a sense of a deja vu. Bella's love affair continues in almost idyllic manner. But it all quickly fades away as the army of newborn vampires ravages Seattle and Victoria, set on revenge, reappears. The only chance for Bella's safety lies in the unlikely alliance of Edward's family and Jacob and his werewolf clan.With a new director and a plot that finally seems to stumble upon the promise of an excitement , some real thrilling action and first resolutions, things could only be better for Eclipse. As it turns out, weight of the layering romantic dilemmas can kill quicker than fangs or claws.Film drags, with the inevitable conflict with Victoria looming somewhere on the horizon but ultimately being postponed time and time again. Film is forced, by the nature of the source material into never-ending conversations about the nature of Bella's choice to, for eternity, be with Edward. But neither the consequences of losing her soul or, finally, emerging triangle with Jacob, push forward enough emotional value to make it all engaging. After third or so lengthy dialogue, it's difficult to shake the feeling that we've been listening to the same neurotic note in Stewart's voice since the opening of the Twilight. Frankly, it seems that for all the emotional anxiety in Twilight's characters Woody Allen would make a great director for the next film. By this time however, boring mannerisms of the entire cast are forgettable and foremost forgivable, considering the lines they have to pronounce. It is sad though that five minutes given to Dakota Fanning's on-screen presence pretty much demolish the rest of the performances, with truly frightening intensity that is not only matched by Sheen's appearance in the New Moon. With words not really pushing the story forward, but rather circling around the obvious, you'd at least hope for some CGI supported action. Well...David Slade attempts grittier and bloodier mood but any hope that the director of atmospheric 30 Days of Night can sustain it, is buried after the first few opening scenes. And it is not until the last 20 minutes that the film moves into less familiar territory. But even then it's let down by the editing that either tries to hide poor special effects or just proves that someone was actually working in the dark. Action sequences are roughly cut and brief- for all the attempt on the tension, they carry too little punch.Verdict: As it stands, Twilight is a dead man of a cinematic franchise with a personality of a teenage soap opera and a quality of a total bore. Brief moments of self referential humour and quick glimpses of, what supposedly was meant to be an epic, brutal confrontation towards the end is hardly a redeeming value. If there is one fault that dominates over the others it would be that after 2 hours we learn nothing and move in no direction whatsoever. No promises are made and frankly, I couldn't care less if someone will even attempt to improve, with inevitably upcoming Breaking Dawn.1.5/5",2,57,107,3 July 2010
V for Vendetta," Good movie, but bad comic filming
","First, I thought: My God, why did they do it to this amazing story, why did they turn great graphic novel into this. But when the end credits appeared on the screen I've changed my mind. There's's a place for both: movie and graphic novel. The first one is a great fun, second one remains this 'uncompromising vision of the future' which movie turned into few dynamic sequences. They surely have their extraordinary power (like in the 'domino falls' scene) but they're not what 'V for Vendetta' supposed to be. Even the main character turned into some clown alike. V is not this intelligent madman anymore, he is like any other Hollywood movie character. Sad...But still it's great fun to watch. And if you haven't read the comic, after watching the movie its the first thing you should do.",8,5,9,2 May 2006
