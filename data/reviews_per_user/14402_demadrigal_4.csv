Your Name.," Highly original, creative, and emotionally effective
","Your Name. starts off treading familiar romantic comedy grounds with a slight magical realism twist that anime fans would also find familiar. But the lighthearted love story that it promises takes a second-act left turn into Kafkaesque territory with sudden plot twists and reveals that create incredible emotional weight and dramatic tension. The characters are well developed, the story is sophisticated, and the themes of gender, trust, and love as a connective force are handled deftly if sometimes unsubtly. It's weird enough that it won't win over anime skeptics and others might criticize the way it plays with narrative structure, but it deserves consideration as the best film of 2016.",10,0,1,27 February 2019
The Birth of a Nation," Overrated, even for it's time and even ignoring it's message
","I've watched this while on a binge of silent-era films and I knew I would come to this film eventually. I expected the racist propaganda, but I was still a bit shocked by how overt it was. Regardless, I knew that it had been praised for its technical and artistic brilliance so I knew it was a must watch. Honestly, I was severely disappointed.The characters are paper thin with little explanation of their motives. This is especially true of the antagonists such as Austin Stoneman and Silas Lynch, who seems to want to do what they do just because they are bad people who need mustaches to twirl. The acting is also pretty atrocious, even making allowances for the theatrical nature of acting at the time. It sometimes looks like some actors are smiling or laughing while in peril or under attack and supposed to be showing fear and terror. The story structure is also pretty poor and different events in the narrative seem to be very loosely connected. Large swaths of the film could have been removed in order to tell a better story. This is even true compared to contemporary films like Les Vampires, released in the same year. Pacing suffers, particularly in the first half of the film in which it languishes introducing characters that won't be relevant for another 2+ hours. The themes are unclear or appear contradictory as well. Griffith's opening intertitles point out that the film is meant to show the horror of war, but the treatment of Ben Cameron's actions during the war are glorified and shown as heroic. Likewise, the final intervention of the KKK is shown as heroic and glamorous rather than horrifying, complete with trumpet fanfares. It's not subtle. Aside from that, there are several references to insidious plans and evil agendas of 'carpetbaggers and scalawags' but it's never clear what those plans are or what makes them so insidious. I was left to assume that this evil agenda was equality between the races. In the final minutes of the film there's a reference to 'Aryan birthright' without ever explaining what that birthright would be, leaving me to assume that Griffith meant White Supremacy.My research has shown that the film is notable for it's advancements in cinematography, but it doesn't really show. Griffith has gotten credit for introducing intercutting, tracking shots, and close-ups but there are earlier examples of each, several more effective than Griffith's in this film. Intercutting, tracking shots, and close-ups were used in The Great Train Robbery in 1903. 1903 also had a famous example of a close-up in Little Doctor and the Sick Kitten. All of these techniques already existed.Even aside from the horrific racist propaganda, it's just not a good film and there are much better films from the time period. For example, Buster Keaton's silent film The General features a Confederate soldier protagonist with clear motives, amazing shot composition, and a tight story.",4,1,7,12 May 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Excellent pieces never really come together and end up with self-indulgent mediocrity
","Almost any given scene in this film is excellently crafted. The acting is fantastic, the dialog is fun, the cinematography, editing, and music all work well together. But once those scenes are assembled, you end with a film that just doesn't come together. There's really nothing that justifies the nearly 3-hour run-time and entire characters, including Margot Robbie's excellent Sharon Tate could have been completely cut out. Even DiCaprio's Rick Dalton could have been cut down to a few minutes of screen time and told the same story. Ultimately, there's probably about 30-minutes of actual story here. I got the feeling that Tarantino wanted to do something like a Short Cuts/Magnolia-style mosaic of semi-interrelated characters but felt the need to do an Inglorious-style alternate-history rage fantasy also and the two never got resolved. In the end, the movie does neither extremely well. The major characters mostly feel developed and realistic (except for the villains) but they really don't have any arc or grow or change in any way. Tons of plot threads never pay off and the changes to actual history feel forced and unrealistic. Even the violent climax was disappointing with a dog (an awesome dog) really doing most of the work. Large portions of the supporting roles seem to be more a collection of cameos than a real cast, which means that it's both distracting and you don't get enough time with many characters for them to develop.That said, Tartantino really understands character and how to show us who Cliff, Rick, and Sharon really are and what matters to them. He also does a great job building suspense in a few key scenes. It's a shame that he couldn't get all of the different parts to come together like he did with Inglorious or Pulp Fiction.",7,1,3,2 January 2020
Joker," Very good but short of greatness
","It took me a little while to put my finger on what was putting me off about this movie and it's really a variety of things. As far as the plot, there are a variety of major contrivances that really seem like they wouldn't happen. His connection to Thomas Wayne, his history of trauma, and his booking on the talk show just seem like a collection of highly unlikely instances and when combined they are just not believable and take you out of the movie. It's also a bit of a stretch that a whole movement would spring up after one incident of a clown killing rich guys. It seems like there would need to be a pattern in order for it to really drum up that kind of attention and message.There's also a series of twists built on top of each other that are both very predictable and distractingly unnecessary. In very short order you find out that Thomas Wayne is Arthur's father, and then that he isn't Arthur's father, and that his mother isn't his mother because he was adopted, and then also his mother ended up in Arkham because of her own mental illness associated with horrific abuse that she allowed him to suffer. And then his female friend turns out to be the result of a delusion. One or two twists is plenty, when you get to 5 it starts to lose it's impact. They also open up a wide variety of plot holes. How did his mother retain custody of him after the abuse and committal? He should have ended up a ward of the state and in foster care, why didn't that happen and why could he remember any of it? How was his mother able to financially support them after coming out of a mental facility? Why did his neighbor's story line abruptly end when he found out she was imaginary? Even if it was going to be ambiguous, you would expect it to have some impact on him whether he's still angry at her or feels guilt or shame or something. Instead, he just seems to forget her and the movie does too. Why doesn't he have any other delusions? People who are delusional tend to have a variety of them but he just seems to have the one centered around this person so that we can have a plot twist.The movie lifts heavily from other movies like King of Comedy and Taxi Driver. Someone also pointed out Fight Club and 12 Monkeys. But really, movies and storytelling have been around long enough that a little thievery is to be expected.The acting is a strong point, particularly from Frances Conroy and Zazie Beetz, who both do a great deal with relatively small parts. Joaquin's performance is good in the quiet moments but the over-the-top bits detract from it. He also over-uses the dancing and the twisted and emaciated body. The first few times you see it, it's disturbing but by the 8th, you're pretty used to it. Personally, I found Conroy's depiction of Arthur's mother as a decrepit, delusional, frightened woman who's son is losing his mind and murdering people to be the most touching and disturbing aspect of the film.Along with the acting, the cinematography, editing, and sound design are very strong. They build creeping senses of dread and foreboding that really make the movie sing in it's best moments.Overall, the movie is a bit sloppy and uneven (and the Batman stuff is largely shoehorned in) but at times it also generates powerful moments as it barrels toward a theme of mistreatment of the mentally ill by society.",7,1,4,22 January 2020
