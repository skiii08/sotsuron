Blade Runner 2049," Wow just wow!
","As a fan of the original I was sceptical as to how anything could possibly come close, but Bladerunner 2049 was a flawless film! A true immersive cinematic experience, the cinematography, score and acting (Luv and Wallace in particular) are fantastic, and the story is so beautifully sad and poignant. If I had one criticism, I think it could have been 30 minutes shorter (from the first half). This movie like the original did not break the box office but it will be a true cult classic like the original, and will be talked about for years to come.",10,4,14,23 October 2018
