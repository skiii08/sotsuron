The Ring," If you truly love cinema avoid this junk and see the original!
","Another lazy American remake of a far superior non-American film.Yet another example of unoriginal copybook filmmaking made by dumb americans for dumb americans.See the Japanese original, yes it has subtitles but for once try using your brain for a change and see a truly creepy and original film.",1,2,7,19 October 2002
Dawn of the Dead," Congratulations Zack Snyder
","I grew up on George A Romero's films in the 70's, so imagine my horror when it was announced that one of my all time faves Dawn of the Dead was going to get a 21st century makeover.Since I've been pretty well bored with so-called American horror films over the last decade or so (Session 9, Blair Witch being two rare exceptional exceptions), I went to the cinema last week in Krakow, Poland, not expecting much.100 mins or so later I came out, my heart pumping, pulses racing. This is NOT a remake, more like an upgrade, fast, furious and fun to boot.Congratulations Zack Snyder and all involved, nice to see a modern horror film with attitude, and I loved all the in-jokes for fans of the original (store Gaylen Ross etc).I look forward to seeing this film again and again...just like the original",9,0,0,10 July 2004
The Village," Despite the misleading trailer, this is an excellent, intelligent film
","I can understand why this film has polarised audiences. It's twist in the final reel is something you will gladly accept or angrily dismiss.The trailer unfortunately is pitched at a horror/suspense audience when ultimately the film is an intelligent look at how some members of society long for the safety and seclusion of a world cut off from modern life.Everything about this film is quality, Roger Deaking's stunning visuals, Shyamalan's crafty and suspenseful direction, superb performances, particularly Bryce Dallas Howard.Despite having worked out the 'twist' within 15 minutes of The Sixth Sense, I've all enjoyed all Shyamalan's films, yes even Unbreakable, and if you enjoyed his previous three films then expect once more to be taken on a journey with more than a few surprises.Another example of intelligent film-making that despite being pitched at an 18-30 audience through its misleading trailer, will probably be more enjoyed by us folks older than that age range, who enjoy films dealing with mature themes.Thoroughly recommended.",9,1,3,14 September 2005
The Exorcist," The Undisputed Champion
","These kids who rave on about how great modern horror films like Scream are, really have missed the boat.Films that desecrate my undies are so few and far between these days, I can't remember the last film to scare me or chill the blood. Candyman in 92 possibly?But in the 70's and 80's my pants were soiled almost weekly - you should have seen my launderette bill. Carrie, Halloween, Don't Look Now, Suspiria, Tenebrae, Hellraiser, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Evil Dead, The Hills Have Eyes and on and on.And then there is The Exorcist. The true champion. Yes it is slowly paced, but deliberately so. It turns the screw slowly, like a slow rollercoaster up a very long incline...and then.....whoosh....diaper time!Today's horror flicks lack that sense of evil that pervades every scene in the Exorcist, the sense of impending and eternal doom that so many of these earlier films gave us.I'm gonna find it hard looking back on the 90's to find FIVE such films.Scream - a horror classic? Don't make me laugh!",10,0,0,10 September 1999
K-19: The Widowmaker," A commendable film which shows that heroes can come from any country.
","I approached this film with some dread, an American production company, an American star and director, dealing with a true Russian story. I was expecting the worse.My fears on this occasion were unfounded. This entertaining cold war story reveals that whatever country we are from, there are people who will go beyond what is expected of them, and do what is necessary to preserve human life.Apart from Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson, all the other actors in this film are unknown to me, and this works in its favour, you believe in these people, these characters, these heroes, who were willing to sacrifice their lives to try and avert a global catastrophe.Yes Ford's Russian accent takes a bit of getting use to, but really after a few minutes you're concentrating on the drama that unfolds.If you enjoy cold war/military/political dramas, then you should enjoy this. If, like me, you enjoyed submarine/u-boat films like Das Boot, The Hunt for Red October, In Enemy Hands and Crimson Tide, you shouldn't be disappointed.A pleasant surprise to see a Hollywood production make an intelligent war film about another country and its people, without a hint of American flag-waving. It could explain why this film 'failed' at the American box-office.",8,4,7,9 July 2005
The Football Factory," An irresponsible film promoting a lifestyle of a bygone age
","Let me say from the outset, I think football hooligans are cretins, neanderthal morons of the lowest order, and those who still persist in this kind of behaviour (thankfully not so many these days) have nothing to do with the beautiful game, they are not 'fans' just thugs.Nick Love's The Football Factory is nothing but a glamourising advert for sickening violence and thuggish behaviour.Apart from the Dudley Sutton character, I had no sympathy for any of the others, it really was a film with few redeeming features, and now that Love has remade The Firm I wonder if he is only capable of making films that promote violence An irresponsible film, only enjoyed by those with a caveman mentality.2/10",2,1,3,24 October 2009
Big Fish," Tim Burton finally comes of age. Perfect!
","So many times before I've been in the situation, where you're sitting in the cinema, three-quarters of the way through a film you think could be a masterpiece, and hoping deep down the filmmakers don't screw it up in the final reel, only to be hugely disappointed when they do.Not Big Fish. Not by Tim Burton. Not this time.This time he's delivered a perfect, timeless, inspirational piece of multi-layered celluloid, full of whimsy, comedy, fantasy, pathos and humanity, that for two hours I had this huge grin on my face and for the final five minutes I cried my eyes out (only the 4th film out of thousands seen to have this effect on me).Hats off to the entire ensemble cast too for memorable performances, particularly Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor.Forget Burton's many previous juvenile efforts, this is a mature piece of filmmaking to be enjoyed by audiences of most ages, but especially by anyone who's lived life a bit. Outstanding. 10/10",10,0,0,7 April 2004
RED," A comedy without any laughs, a thriller without any thrills.
","I really wanted to enjoy this film.Such a stellar cast and so much potential, but boy did the scriptwriters and director blow this one big time.The film just bumbled from one scene to the next, with no concept of pacing, timing, let alone story or character development.I can't believe with so much going for it that something so dull could be turned out. I think I laughed once.It only gets a a 3/10 because it was great to see Ernest Borgnine in two scenes, a truly lovely fella and a credit to his profession.A missed opportunity and not worthy of your hard-earned cash.",3,3,9,10 February 2011
The Matrix," The Machine makes its debut
","Well I never thought I'd find a film so devoid of humanity, so soulless, so relentless in its desire to bombard the senses with special effects without even the remotest hint of a coherent plotline, that I'd actually leave the cinema feeling depressed....but yep...today I had such an experience...The Matrix...the first movie I've seen that felt like it was directed by a machine...give me David Cronenberg's Videodrome anytime.",1,15,36,9 July 1999
The Cabin in the Woods," Very entertaining vision of hell on earth!
","Just watched The Cabin In The Woods, I knew nothing about it and it was a real surprise.I've watched a lot of horror films over the last 35 years and this one combines elements of some of my all-time favourites such as The Evil Dead, Hellraiser and Suspiria. While I wouldn't put The Cabin In The Woods in the same bracket at those classics it's not that far short.The cast, including Bradley Whitford and Richard Jenkins, seem to be having a fun time in amongst all the nonsense, and the cameo at the end introducing The Director put a huge smile on my face.Once hell is released on earth, and all the monsters/demons/zombies are released from their cages/rooms. it really is great to see such a horror film fanboy's wish-list of mayhem and destruction on screen.While it's a real mishmash of films gone by, The Cabin In The Woods certainly one of the most entertaining horror films of the last decade, and well worth a look for horror fans who appreciate a fast-paced action-packed film, with some WTF moments and plenty of laughs along the way.8/10",8,1,6,28 August 2012
