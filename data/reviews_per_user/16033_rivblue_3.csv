It," Watch the original!!!!
","This new adaptation of it was a complete let down. Watch the original with Tim Curry as Pennywise. To this day, it still creeps the hell out of me. This version was not creepy at all and I really just wanted it to end. I give it a 6 because well it is what it is. 1s and 10s come on people a movie has to be super special for a 10 and as for a 1, you must have stopped watching minutes on because only a truly lousy movie deserves that,",6,0,2,20 November 2019
Deadpool 2," No one for giving tens or ones!!!!
","I finally watched it. I've owned Deadpool 2 on blue ray for a year and just watched it. WTF took me so long? Giving any movie a 10 is very hard to do. Deadpool 2 in my opinion deserves the 10. Sure a lot of they time they tried a little to hard to be funny, but it still landed most of the time. The Gratuitous violence and immature behavior plus is what makes this movie great. If you haven't watch DP 2, watch it now! You probably won't give it a 10, but you'll enjoy it.",10,3,4,22 November 2019
Joker," Had such high hopes for Joker!!
","What can I say? I was looking so forward to Joker. This was supposed to be a masterpiece. I was severely let down. Phoenix did do a great job as Joker. Can't deny that, but I was expecting so much more. I thought this movie was supposed to be weird/strange and very gritty. I have more strange and gritty in my 6 inch pecker.",5,4,18,27 November 2019
