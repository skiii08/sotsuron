The Blair Witch Project," Scary......
","I just saw this movie, the Swedish opening. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. When normal scary movies are released, the main theme is to manipulate the monster in so many ways possible, to make the audience scared by watching guts and blood all over. This one is very different. No monster, no special effects, nothing like that at all. You know it's there, and that is enough for you to be really scared. Trust me, you don't want to go on a camping trip into the woods after seeing this movie! A straight 10/10 movie!",8,0,1,16 October 1999
