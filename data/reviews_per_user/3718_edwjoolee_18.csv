The Blair Witch Project," Utter waste of time...
","Somebody please kick me for having paid full admission price to see this garbage in a movie theater when it first opened. Noting the fact that this movie had done so well in the theaters, I must come to one conclusion: there must have been countless suckers just like me who had kicked themselves afterwards for having been swindled and suckered into seeing this movie by the hype surrounding it. A weekend college film project posing as a movie, and not even scary to boot. And the characters? They are the most annoying, talentless non-actors ever to grace the screen. The plot? Was there one?...Something about a witch... Bah!!! Avoid this sorry excuse for a movie.",Null,2,4,28 February 2002
Scarface," Entertaining film about gangsters.
","Loud, crude, violent and highly entertaining, Scarface is a live-wire of a film. Although not without its faults, this film boldly explores the seamy, violent underworld of criminals. It is a roller-coaster ride of a film, often jolting the viewers with scenes of mindless graphic violence and vulgarity. Al Pacino plays the character of Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee who rises from a street drug-courier to a major underworld boss, with unrestrained abandon and incredible energy. In the Godfather trilogy, Al Pacino's Michael Corleone was a man of introspection, intelligence, honor, discipline and tact. Tony, on the other hand, is all machismo and crude vigor, a man unable to rein in his passions and emotions. They are almost polar opposites. Oftentimes, Tony Montana comes off as a caricature, always appearing ready to spring at someone with his perpetual sneer and scowl glued to his face, spewing vulgarity at every turn. Al Pacino pretty much hams it up as Tony Montana and is fun to watch.Other actors of note are Steven Bauer as Tony's right-hand man and Michelle Pfeiffer as Tony's quiet suffering wife. Michelle Pfeiffer is great in this film. She is able to exude vulnerability and innocence through her cold, sad and distant exterior. The film is nicely shot and well-directed by Brian De Palma. Only minor complaint I have about the film is that it often verges on the cartoonish, with caricatures for characters and over-the-top violence, but they are very minor. This is still a fun, entertaining film with great acting. Check it out.",Null,0,0,13 March 2002
Minority Report," Why I liked this film....
","Minority Report is an enthralling film of the highest order, containing a plausible future scenario full of spell-binding imageries and concepts, all wrapped up in a thought-provoking storyline. The movie is an amalgam of Blade Runner, The Fugitive and Mission-Impossible, and just as, if not more, exciting. But what puts this film above others is the workout your brain gets, along with the usual visual pleasantries you would get from a typical Steven Spielberg film. The story revolves around Tom Cruise as John Anderton, a detective who works for the Pre-Crime unit of the police department around the mid-21st Century. By employing the psychic abilities of 3 pre-Cogs, John Anderton and his team are able to catch potential killers before they commit a crime. Unfortunately, John Anderton becomes tagged as the next would-be murderer by the premonitary visions the pre-Cogs have and, thereafter, finds himself on the lam, evading authorities while trying to uncover the truth behind the events that have been foretold. Along the way, the viewer is treated to a futuristic world that is oddly familiar, but,in many ways,different from ours. There are the familiar homes situated in typical suburban settings that are straight out of any old suburban neighborhood in the U.S. and people wearing clothes that are more 20th Century than what people wore in , say, Blade Runner. However, look closely and the world of Minority Report is brimming with high-tech gadgetry and imageries:from the sophisticated pre-Crimefcrafts to the eye scanning machines that detect the ID of person, from 'moving' billboards covering just about every wall to the computer screens that can show moving visual images in life-like size,...in short, it is a highly believable future world. Aside from the briskly-paced storyline and great action sequences are the myriad questions the film raises:about free will, freedom, personal loss, etc...Although I do believe that the film sends,IMHO, the right message regarding free will, the ending seemed too mundane and blah for the task of answering such a grand philosophical inquiry, even if the film is touted mainly as a murder mystery. However, the overall strength of the film clearly outweighs any minor flaws of the film.Clearly,Tom Cruise was right for the role of John Anderton. He is able to imbue the character with the right mixture of complexity, vulnerability and brashness to paint a solidly fleshed out character. Steven Spielberg's direction and visual flair is, as always, technically brilliant and sophisticated. A great film.",Null,0,0,27 June 2002
Dawn of the Dead," A worthy remake...
","I loved the original Dawn of the Dead. I remember seeing it as a young kid and being fascinated, shocked, repulsed and excited by the imageries shown in that film. The movie represented for me at the time everything that was adult and taboo.The new remake is a complete makeover of the original: it is made for the MTV generation, with fast editing, quick pacing and unrelenting action. In other words, the new DOD is intended for mass consumption. And that is not a bad thing if it is done right, and, in my opinion, the new DOD gets it right.There are more characters than in the original. And the new film clocks in at way below the two hour mark, whereas, if my memory serves me right, the original ran much longer than 2 hrs. The new version, therefore, lacks clearly defined characters, and the pacing of the film seems somewhat rushed under the limited time constraint.However, the film is a hoot. It is briskly paced and the action sequences are furious at times. Also, it is a scary film. What the film lacks in characterization, it wholly makes up for it by turning the action meter on up high.Undeniably, there will be die-hard fans of the original who will dismiss the new version as a needless remake. That is their right, and I support their right to their opinions. However, the new DOD is entertaining in its own right, i.e., as a divergent, action-oriented horror film.",8,1,2,14 July 2005
Hostel," Not as harrowing or brutal as others make it out to be...
","The subject matter underlying Hostel should have been enough to make this movie a harrowing one. However, the film did not reach the level that it should have in dealing with the subject matter.The main problem with the film was the characters in the movie: they act like typical, horny teenagers straight out of typical, teenage sex comedy movies. If these characters had been in, say, American Pie or Porky's, they would not have appeared out of place. Here, they act as distractions. They are not memorable or have any redeeming qualities about them. The only character who I felt had any depth and substance was the main character, played by Jay Hernandez, but only barely.The story itself unfolds unevenly: the first half plays like a sex comedy and the second half, like exaggerated torture and gore flick. Unfortunately, even the bad characters are portrayed like caricatures and, thereby, ruin the realism of any of the scenes that could have had any massive, visceral impact.Hostel is not a boring or unwatchable film, however. To be sure, there is much genuine suspense and terror throughout the film, especially in the second half, but not to the degree it was purported to have had at the time of the release.A passable, gore film that should please most gorehounds.",6,0,0,4 May 2006
Oldboy," Utterly watchable...
","This is one great movie: hip, violent and thoroughly compelling. Despite the unjustified and totally lame criticism of this movie by a whining buffoon below me, this movie brings an added welcome to the sea of crap that have been coming out in recent years. I don't always agree with Tarantino's assessment of films that he likes, but on his praise of this filmI am in total accord.I will not belabor the reader with a synopsis of this movie since others below me have done a good job of describing the premise of this film. However, I should mention that this film is deftly handled both visually and story-wise. Every scene and frame evidences painstaking care and consideration, even though the film as a whole is fast-paced. The choreographed action scenes are thoroughly refreshing and totally original. I just loved this film. Like some of the other great directors coming out of Asia, the director of this film should definitely be on the watchlist. Thoroughly and without reservation, recommended.",9,29,121,28 July 2004
Brokeback Mountain," Not just for homosexuals...
","I rather enjoyed this film.As others have pointed out, Brokeback Mountain is really a simple love story about love and longing; sort of like a modern retelling of Romeo and Juliet, but with two males, rather than a male and female, as leads.I found the story powerful in its simplicity: two men fall in love, but cannot seem to consummate their relationship in an official way due to the intolerance, both legal and cultural, of the society in which they live.I am not homosexual, but that is not a requisite to enjoy a movie of this kind. A movie like this is about love and friendship, universal traits that are sorely lacking in the world today.",8,16,24,20 April 2006
Silent Hill," Creepy...
","I had the sense while viewing Silent Hill that the makers of this film were aiming for box office business that the Ring and the Grudge conjured up.Silent Hill reminded me a lot of the Ring: both are heavy on psychic elements; contain young, malignant evildoers; and rely heavily on creepy atmosphere, instead of outright gore.Although Silent Hill is a bit more creepier and intense than the Ring, the storyline is not as immersive: the characters are given short shrift, while the creepy backdrop is given substantial more detail. The film felt more like an interactive video game, like the one which it was based, than a narrative film with solid story construction.I did like many parts of the film, though. There are imageries in the film that clearly stand out: the creatures are imaginatively rendered and are truly grotesque. Also the mood and the atmosphere of the film were dreadful and gloomy throughout, clearly appropriate for the film of this kind.I give Silent Hill a solid 7.",7,1,3,24 April 2006
Once," A great love story with great music.
","This movie captivated and impressed me in the greatest possible way. Why, you ask? Let me explain.I have seen a lot of so-called 'romance' movies and every time, especially with the movies that are coming out of Hollywood, I am completely underwhelmed: tidy, but generic plot lines, corny and ridiculous set-ups and obvious 'acting' that, whether good or bad, seem artificial and 'put-on'.What makes 'Once' so endearing and appealing is the fact that the main leads seem so genuine and believable: their affection for each other is delivered so naturally and with such coy innocence that I was completely won over. It is as if though we are made privy to their lives in a moment in time in their lives, and we as an audience are emotionally enriched for it.The main leads are obviously accomplished and talented musicians. To be sure, there are great songs on display in this movie. If you are not moved by some of the 'musical' scenes in this movie, you are either pulse-dead or completely lack humanity. I hope to see these actors, hopefully together again, in the future.10 out of 10.",10,2,3,22 February 2009
Taxi Driver," Bleak, violent and uncompromising
","Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver is not a comfortable film to sit through. It is dark, disturbing and uncompromising in its portrayal of a desperately lonely man on the verge of psychosis. The setting of Taxi Driver is New York, and as in Midnight Cowboy, it is shown as an urban city that, while superficially is bustling and teeming with humanity, is also an uninviting place of sin, corruption, crime, despair and loneliness.Travis Bickle(Robert De Niro) lives in that city, and, at the beginning of the film, finds work as a taxi driver to escape sleepless nights. HIs work as taxi driver takes him to every part of the city, allowing him to come in contact with all sorts of people, especially the unsavory kind---e.g., pimps, prostitutes, thugs, robbers, etc. Initially, he views all the goings-on in the city and its denizens with a sort of detached cynicism and contempt, seemingly as an outside observer looking in.However, his uneventful life takes a turn when he falls for a political campaign worker named Betsy, played by the beautiful Cybil Sherpard. There is a telling scene on their first date in a coffee house where Betsy quotes a song lyric to describe Travis as a '...a pusher and a poet, a walking contradiction', whereby Travis somewhat angrily responds,'are you saying that about me?..I ain't a pusher and I ain't never pushed...' The scene, aside from showing the naivete Travis possesses, also reveals a sort of truism of Travis' character: He IS a character full of contradictions. Here is a man who rants against the filth of the city---the prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers, etc...---and yet spends his solitary days in a porn theater (and once even tries to pick up the ticket girl). Or, that he takes the conservative Betsy to a porn movie on their first night on the town, which prompts her to run out of the theater, insulted and hurt.Travis' descent into psychosis becomes markedly pronounced after his breakup with Betsy immediately following the porn movie incident. He becomes more withdrawn and increasingly consumed with irrational thoughts. He also hooks up with a 13 year old prostitute whom he had met earlier briefly and tries to be the self-designated guardian and savior to the street-savvy girl, trying desperately to steer her life around. (I wondered if he was doing that out of genuine compassion or because he saw a sort of young Betsy in her, corrupted but stll salvageable, unlike Betsy who is 'just like the rest of them') All the while, he concocts a plan which is clearly, or at least in my mind, a desparate attempt by an unhinged mind to get back at Betsy.The climax of the film is incredibly unsettling. All I will say is that the the scenes will uncomfortably be lodged in your mind for a few days afterwards upon viewing the film.The performance by Robert De Niro is impeccably played and is the heart of the film. The viewer sees through his eyes, and lives and breathes through him for two hours. There is not a faltering moment in his portrayal of this complex, emotionally-charged character.  And the city of New York has never been shown with such realism, its ugliness and beauty both inhabiting the same world in a sort of discordant harmony so typical of modern city. Ultimately, Taxi Driver is a psychological roller-coaster ride filled with bumps and twists, and the viewer will be emotionally drained by the end of the film. A modern cinematic achievement.",Null,0,0,15 July 2002
Full Metal Jacket," Stanley Kubrick's Vietnam
","Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is a different kind of war film. In it, we find neither brave soldiers whose acts of heroism we can easily identify with, nor clear-cut black-and-white messages about the war in easily digestible bits. Rather, it examines the roles our sanctified military institutions played in creating and molding recruits into soldiers, and, ultimately, criticizes that whole process as having churned out unthinking robots devoid of moral and ethical reasoning. The first half of the film deals with the boot camp experiences of fresh young recruits. From the opening shots of the young recruits having their heads shaved to the subsequent day-to-day experiences of physical and mental challenges they endure, the whole process is about one thing: conformity. They are presided over by the hard-nosed, no-nonsense seargent, played brilliantly by R. Lee Ermey, whose sole purpose is to turn these recruits into 'killers'. Those who are physically or mentally not up to the challenge are reviled and punished, as is the case with one recruit named Pvt. Gomer Pyle, a fat, uncoordinated and naive kid. There is an ironic twist at the end of this first half that is shocking, but somehow not surprising given what came before. The second half of the film is set in Vietnam during the Tet Offensive, where we follow one of the recruits from the first half, Private Joker(played by Mathew Modine), now a soldier journalist, through the burned-out ruins of VIetnam. Unlike other Vietnam war movies where fights overwhelmingly are set in jungles, in this film, they occur mostly in rubble-strewn towns or cities, and are of short duration. I had problem with the second half of the film because there is no real sustained tension in any of the battle scenes: what battle scenes(more like skirmishes) there are seemed to have been afterthoughts in Stanley Kubrick's vision of Vietnam. Maybe, Kubrick was more interested in the message he was trying to convey in the film. I don't know, but I was disappointed. Moreover, the second half plays incongruously, juxtaposing scenes of violence or battle next to scenes of inconsequence, or worse, comedy.   However, the final scene of the film is a powerful one. I won't give it away, but it poses a dilemma that the soldiers are ill-equipped to deal with. Only Pvt. Joker is able to see through the smoke screen of war, and see the moral or ethical dilemma inherent in that situation. How Joker reacts in that scene is ultimately true of war in general. That is, there are no clear-cut right and wrong, only ambivalence and more questions. Something soldiers are not trained or conditioned to deal with.",Null,0,0,20 March 2002
The Godfather: Part II," Never a dull moment in this brilliant film.
","Godfather 2 is an incredible movie. Francis Ford Coppola has done an expert job of continuing and expanding upon the story of the first film, adding an incredible amount of detail and information that requires repeat viewing. The incorporation of the story chronicling the early life of Vito Corleone who goes from a grocery store errand boy to the local crime boss is fascinating and revealing, and seems to parallel the life of MIchael Corleone as he tries to juggle and strategize in his quest to further expand and legitimize his empire.   Great nuanced performances from Robert De Niro (as the young Vito Corleone), Al Pacino, Lee strasburg (who expertly portrays the crafty and aging Hyman Roth), John Cazale and Diane Keaton further enliven this inspired film. Subtle and full of feeling, they bring incredible amount of depth to their performances. Check out Robert De Niro and Al Pacino especially, they are amazing to watch. If you haven't seen this classic film, do so by all means.",Null,0,1,11 March 2002
Resident Evil," Milla Jovovich kicks @ss with authority.
","See Milla Jovovich karate kick and blow away zombies, mutants and beasts in this fast-paced and action-packed genre blender. Is the film good? Yes, if you like mindless action/horror film with scenes that are less-than-original and derivative, but well-done with some genuinely tense and scary moments. Is the film violent? Somewhat, but not as much as I had hoped. Actually, it has surprisingly less gore than the video game from which it was adapted. Will this film win any Academy awards? Are you on drugs? Of course not, this is a mindless actioner that you will probably forget once you leave the theatre. Recommended.",Null,0,0,17 March 2002
Independence Day," Roland Emmerich is Michael Bay's professional twin
","When I realized that the director of this nonsense was none other than Roland Emmerich, the esteemed auteur of such grand and moving epics as Godzilla and The Patriot, well, I should have known. Here is a bold artist, a visionary, who willingly disregards the age old and respected conventions of film-making-- i.e., decent story and character development--and defiantly says, 'the hell with it...all I need are a good group of sound and special effects crew and a whole lof of digitized effects, throw everything on the screen in a helter-skelter manner so as to appease the MTV-crowd, and, dammit, I've got a sure-fire blockbuster on my hands...Woohoo!'
Upon seeing this incredibly mind-numbing dross, I was reminded of another director who seems to be Emmerich's artistic and professional twin: Michael Bay. Both make movies geared towards the MTV generation, don't give a hoot what the critics think of their movies, have no clue as to what a good script or storyline should look like, and contributes, whether consciously or unconsciously, in the dumbing down of American cinema. Unbelievable.",Null,1,3,16 July 2002
Rosemary's Baby," Great horror film.
","Slowly percolating tension in the first two thirds of the film gives way to nightmarishly terrifying last third in this Roman Polanski's highly effective horror film. MIa Farrow and John Cassavetes play newlyweds Rosemary and Guy Woodward who move into an apartment in New York where their seemingly happy lives take a strange turn when they befriend kooky old neighbors, Minnie and Roman Castavets. Polanski does a great job of creating an ominous atmosphere throughout, with a  disturbing sense of unease in the viewer created by a series of strange events and suggestions via subtle shifts in the characters' moods and behaviors. Mia Farrow is perfect in the role as Rosemary, innocent, vulnerable and uncommonly fragile. Ruth Gordon is fantastic as the garrulous and nosy old neighbor with an annoying habit of inviting herself unannounced and uninvited to her new neighbors. There are some interesting dream (or are they?) sequences in the film that are surreal and highly symbolic. They are effectively employed at right moments in the film, punctuating the increasing dread in the unhinged world of its protagonist. Excellent.",Null,0,1,23 March 2002
The Great Escape," Great Entertainment
","This is an excellent movie about World War 2 and a prime example of how a prison escape movie should be made. A fine ensemble cast of excellent actors, including Steve McQueen, James Garner, Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson and James Coburn among others, who all do their bits unselfishly and with a cooperative spirit. Among these actors, Steve McQueen truly shines. Always cool, easy-going and optimistic, he embodies the heart and spirit of this action-packed movie. He brings not only great action (check out the motorcycle scene), but also a sense of levity to his scenes that are fun and entertaining. Masterful direction by John Sturges and a great musical score don't hurt either. John sturges and Steve McQueen had teamed up before in the excellent The Magnificent Seven, which also starred James Coburn.   For those looking for pure entertainment, this movie delivers. Highly recommended.",Null,2,4,10 March 2002
Donnie Darko," That name.
","Donnie Darko is dark, strange and flawed. The film plays more like an episode of The X-Files or The Outer Limits than anything else, with an interesting premise and story that is needlessly drawn out to full film length. Therefore, we get characters that are nominal to the story appearing only to add more screen time to the film. For instance, Drew Barrymore's and Patrick Swayze's characters are so irrelevant to the plot, their big name attraction only serves to deter from rather than help the plot of the film. 
Donnie Darko, played well by Jake Gyllenhaal, is a high school kid suffering from auditory and visual hallucinations, somnambulism, indifference, teenage angst, etc. In other words, he's a mess. He also has an invisible friend named Frank, a twisted-looking rabbit, who tells him at the beginning of the film that he has certain amount of days and time left before the world will end. He also commands Donnie to do certain deeds before that time, all of them involving illegal activities that I won't describe here. And then we have all the rest of the characters who seemingly exist only to provide as 'fillers' in the film , neither helping nor adding anything of value to the core of the story.   That's a shame, because the story itself is suspenseful, ominous and engaging. It's not a big-budget film, and I also liked that aspect of it. Still, Donnie Darko is not a bad film. 7/10.",Null,0,0,18 March 2002
Goodfellas," A masterpiece.
","When a movie this good comes along, I break down like a little child and weep. What can I say, Martin Scorsesse is God. The way he employs the visual medium to spill his heart and soul is breathtaking. Goodfellas is THE movie about the Mafia,and criminals in general. As good as The Godfather trilogy is, this movie, in my opinion, is much better.It's the little things in the film, like the way the characters banter and joke with one another, the way they hang out in bars and restaurants, the paroxysm of violence that occasionally mark their days, the way they celebrate eachothers birthdays and weddings, etc..., that help place this film way ahead of othersin its genre, including The Godfather 1 and 2.
Martin Scorsesse does an excellent job of conveying the daily routine and lives of these mobsters, portraying them as basically sad hoodlums, no more and no less. Their spiral downward seems all but inevitable.
All of the cast in this film are excellent, especially Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta. Fluid camerawork, masterful direction and great music are added to the mix to bring one, exhilarating piece of modern cinematic masterpiece. 'Nuff said.",Null,0,0,26 February 2002
