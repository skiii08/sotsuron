Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Childhood classics
","Lightsaber may have been a lamp for a child who didn't see star wars when he was young, but it left a sacred position in my heart, just like Altman, let alone I'm stupid, everyone has such a piece of land in their heart.The first time I saw the phantom crisis was in the sixth grade. I revisited it eight years later. When I went to a dream, I saw the red faced uncle's two-way sword, the lovely Anakin, and the childish Obi Wan again. That's just cool",8,0,0,13 May 2020
12 Angry Men," Amazing
",The best interpretation of opinion leaders in movies,8,0,0,12 May 2020
The Dark Knight," Act of God
","It's a good match for the theme level. In the film, it's just right to repeat some clown themes. It's good. There's a bit of noise behind it",9,0,0,14 May 2020
Blood Diamond," Good themes are buried
","It can only be said that it's OK. The plot is not good enough. Leonardo's acting skills have improved, but the story is a bit stretched, but reflects a cruel reality.",6,0,3,25 May 2020
Titanic," Eternal love
","I've seen it more than once, and I can find many details each time. Many of them can touch my point again",8,0,1,23 May 2020
The Great Gatsby," Not bad
","Gatsby is a lucid dreamer who sees through everything but is always willing to move forward with hope. He fell in love with his dream, so he didn't want to wake up. In such an era of flashy reality, people who dream of love are pure, and people who insist on pursuing dreams are brave, so Gatsby is great. However, the director is too busy to stack up, the visual effect is very good, but the movie impressed me most is the song, which constantly surrounds my ears, making me sad",7,0,0,23 May 2020
