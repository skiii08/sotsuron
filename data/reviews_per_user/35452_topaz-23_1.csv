The Incredible Hulk," Don't fink just fight.
","Ang Lee is Barton Fink. Back in 03 Ang/Barton comes to stay in Hollywood hell to write a script for an inherently silly movie. However... Ang is talented and sensitive and tries to show us something beautiful and different. Ang/Barton thinks that movies shouldn't be dumb with uninteresting characters, or be full of mindless action or be cliché ridden and full of terrible dialogue. So Ang really puts effort into working in an unfamiliar setting attempting to transform and transcend the usual genre clichés.Hollywood and cinema goers are not pleased. What they really wanted was a Wallace Beery wrestling picture with lots of action! So Hollywood brings in a director who specialises in Wallace Beery wrestling pictures with lots of action!, and together they give the cinema goers what they wanted all along.",3,8,15,27 June 2008
