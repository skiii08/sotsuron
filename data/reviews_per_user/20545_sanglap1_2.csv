Blade Runner 2049," Art at its best
","It is obvious that you will see unexplained scenes and the magic of CGI in a science fiction. But what is not obvious is the slow and dramatic pace, the retro style, the psychedelic effect, the artistic set and a surreal vision, a classic and heart pumping background score, a sudden rise in adrenaline followed by a cold silence and last but not the least remarkable performances by every single character in the movie. But I think Ford (Deckard) was much more intense in delivering his emotions in 1982 Blade runner. However, it is Ryan Gosling's best performance till date after Notebook.Some people felt that the movie is bit slow and some scenes could have been edited to engage the viewers. But for me I think that's where it has succeeded. It is the realness of a moment which is more engaging than the breakneck stupid CGI scenes without any soul.The soundtrack was the backbone of 1982 blade runner and Vangeli used a variety of classical compositions from different culture and society. But Zimmer and Wallfisch has done it again and you will hear and see some classics by Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presely. This is also not something obvious in a sci-fi.Cinematography of this film is a visual treat. Any movie buff knows who Roger Deakins is and this time he has painted the sadness of this dystopian world with his artistic frames that it is so easy to lost in that world without 3d glass or VR gear. If you are a fan of Roy Betty and fan of art and fan of Dennis Villeneuve and his complex story telling, then go for it. But yes, this will haunt you and torture you and ask you several questions for which probably you do not have any answer today. It will surely trigger the philosophical quotient of your brain and you will start questioning the core purpose and value of being human. The last scene will remind you Roy Betty from 1982 Blade runner -'I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die.'",10,7,15,27 October 2017
Parasite," Parasite - an unconventional storytelling
","What is Parasite - A Satire? Sarcasm, humor, emotion, human condition, suspense, thriller, social issues, drama, thought provoking dialogues, strong and smooth acting - all ingredients cooked with utmost perfection and balance and served with elegance and style.It is an unconventional storytelling, it may look very simple and everyone might watch and love this film but it has layers of strong and complex structure and an extraordinary artistic flavor. The beauty of cinema lies in its frame, because that's the window through which we watch and experience the story. And that's where comes the cinematography and the production design, it has a rich and subtle tone with detail level precision , every frame, every shot is unforgettable. Another unconventional part of this movie is it's background score, we hear operatic music during a slow motion chaos. May be the background score is inspired from Hitchcock movies.This film and the characters do not leave you after you finish watching, it stays with you, even if you want you can't escape from them, then slowly you learn to live with them in your head, because you are also one of them. It is a hypnotic movie which is disturbing but you will still want to watch it again and again, probably because you want to laugh, cry and get scared - all at the same time.Parasite touches so many corners of human emotions without trying too hard to over amplify any scene or sequence. Kudos to Director Bong Joon-ho for his visionary approach to tell a story which is not unknown to anyone, forcing us to believe that we are very much part of this cruel world.",10,10,14,8 February 2020
