Conquest 1453," I know I shouldn't
","I know I should not write this review since I cannot made it till end. Yes first time my cinema watching history I deliberately quit the theater and did not watch the whole movie.I remember screenwriters' strike in Hollywood some time ago, they hold right to do so (take their worth of money) because they are obviously doing very very important job. I wish we as Turkish cinema had some decent screenwriters..Fetih has got a terrible scenario. Some say doesn't reflect history correctly (Ulubatli and many other parts of history is mainly legends by the way) but my problem is not that, my problem is, scenario is written in a way as if this is not a cinema movie but some sort of Discovery Channel history flick, it's telling everything written in school books of history (correct or not) step by step. This is not cinema, this is not story telling, this is not watchable.Fetih unfortunately wasted money, hopes and time of the audience in my opinion. But for sure, some people who has never been to cinema (and not intention if it's not for Fetih) goes to cinema for these kind of movies. We saw the same thing happening in movies like Kurtlar Vadisi, Allahın Sevgili Kulu, Ny'ta Beş Minare etc. I think this is a gain for Turkish people as they meet the miraculous silver screen, but also boosts terrible movies.And last but not least, if this is place for wannabe critic's arena, why should we not write our opinions about terrible movies? Isn't is just we deceive ourselves if we write 'hey perfect movie, come and watch', I don't think rest of the world gives a s.hit about Fetih (name of the movie-Conquest) or Faith(name of the sultan)? As we don't know,like or care about Napoleon, Shakespeare etc.Peace and wisdom be with you! ;)",4,12,26,3 April 2012
Oldboy," What can I say ?
","I'm always skeptic about eastern movies because I'm too used to American (I mean Hollywood of course) or European point of view, sense of humor and understanding that eastern thinking usually feels naive.This movie is sum of all those = very good acting, good work of film making, nice scenes, quite decent story telling... Technically perfect.But subject of it, things it tries to tell are not very clean or acceptable for average western movie goer.I don't want to bring it to east-west debate/comparison here, I'm an eastern myself actually, but the thing is that the movie tells important things that are not important. It strives to make us believe something foolish, we accept it for sake of the movie and wait to see what will happen and nothing happens. Main concept, prison, all the plan and many things in the movie are unreal and non-logical.There are thousands of men in the real life doing 15-20 years of imprisonment and when they go out they don't attack to first woman they see (some of them might do :).Bad guy says 'I raised your daughter from the age of 3 to this age', is this easy to buy for us? What kind of wacko plans this kind of 'revenge', puts one in to very special prison (private prison ?? ), waits for 15 years ? Bad guy wants to take the revenge, but obviously our guy didn't know that the girl was his daughter so this is not the same thing bad guy did with his sister, they knew everything. At this point what the movie suggests is not moral in any country or community I believe.So, in general, movie keeps your attention, your don't just turn it off, wait but at the end it doesn't worth it unfortunately.",7,2,11,15 January 2008
Juno," Juno, poor kid that made us laugh.
","----Watch out, real spoiler------ There are films technically flawless, good acting, superb direction, nice script you know everything looks fine. But still it leaves you with a bitter taste...Juno is a movie, it's actually the name of the girl that movie is about. This sixteen year old young lady learns that she's got pregnant from her first sex experience with a classmate boy who doesn't seem to aware of a sh*t! Then she first goes to him to tell that she's pregnant and she doesn't get any intelligible response from him. She decides to go to abortion, by the way she's discussing the situation with her closest girl friend and we learn this kind of issues are not so unknown to those teenagers since they know abortion center and all the other stuff about it. At this point it's the question that comes to our mind why they didn't protect themselves while having sex, but movie is all about 'this kind of things do happen!'.Juno first goes to abortion center but cannot bare it and turns back.Then Juno and her girl friend come up with an incredible solution, they found a adoption couple from newspaper ads. So baby will goto a loving and caring nice family and everything will be fine. But before that they must tell the situation to Juno's family, her father and stepmother.Juno does that, and surprisingly her parents take this very calmly. They don't actually comment on this. Juno and her father go to adopting family, they are rich, nice, willing to a have the baby and everything is okay.Then pregnancy goes on, Juno's belly getting bigger and bigger.Juno and adopting father interestingly becomes friends. Juno visits him time to time, they seem to have common interests like music, horror movies and such.On her last visit, Juno and the guy (husband of adopting family) gets real close, I mean they dance and hug. Here we clearly see that Juno is a poor lonely girl, hungry for love, she's seeking love or to be loved everywhere or with everyone. Her stepmother, whose a very nice woman as an stepmother in fact, tells once to Juno after one of her visits to adopting family's husband, 'I know you, stop going to him, he's married, you cannot drop by anyones house like that', I think this scene is one of the key points of the movie, should have been more emphasized.But husband tells Juno that he doesn't actually want the baby, his wife is crazy about having the baby, he gave the ad to newspaper expecting no one to reply. He's not happy with the marriage and he's going to divorce. At this point wife arrives home and Juno leaves their house crying. But couple hours later she comes back and gives them a note which we did not see at that time.Juno and her stupid boyfriend become friends again, at this point we think they'll have the baby together and (even) they'll marry.She gives birth the baby, but adopting family, I mean only the wife, takes the baby, because the note Juno left says to wife 'I am still in, if you're in'.Then everything is good. Juno and her boyfriend sing a song together and movie ends (I'm not kidding!).I was really shocked when I watched a TV show about teenage-pregnancy one or two years ago. There were families (mostly mothers), and they say 'we should inform our children about safer sex and blah blah .. ' But nobody talked about morals. Sex without marriage is bad enough (of course in my believing) but letting your 13 year old kid to intercourse with someone and to learn that she's pregnant must be the worst thing can happen to any parent.And NO woman (yes she's a women now) can cope with giving away her baby easily. It must be catastrophic for her. Something that will go with her all the way her life. If you take a puppy from it's mother, mother dog cries for a week at least!As some of other comments said, nice movie about very tough topic, and sometime it feels that movie makes things to look less worse than actually they are..Poor kid Juno forgive us for laughing at you or what happened to you.",7,2,11,18 January 2008
The Prestige," How many times a movie can trick you?
","I was told that the movie is above the average but I did not expect it to fix me to the chair for two hours actually.I know it's been mentioned in many other comments already but I also want to praise the director as how easily he tells us the story with perfect flashbacks. If you watch closely (pun intended) then you never get lost in this very complex script.As speaking of acting and cast, it's almost perfect. Bale gives unbelievable play and Jackman is man of his role also it's pure joy to watch Michael Caine. Johansson is very believable and quite pretty (oddly not so beautiful in this one though.)I'm afraid the movie could not hide 'the secret(s)' till the end for me, yet it surprised and amazed me so many times. I can see now how true it is that one gets fooled mostly because he wants it this way.It's for sure that I'll see more tricks when I watch it again and again. This movie is one of those movies that is gives you too much at once and you need to watch it till you absorb all of what it offers.",8,1,3,6 December 2007
Lost in Translation," Very intense movie
","Alright, I perfectly understand why some of you guys don't like this movie and find it boring. Actually, I really like one of the comments which says 'a boring movie about two bored people' :) But, the art of cinema is to tell the most difficult one in a visual way. The story is about feelings that we all sometimes have and even can't express to ourselves...So, the director's done a great work here, and if you watch this in a quiet spare time (especially when you feel a bit blue) and watch for little details and small messages in the movie, I'm sure you gonna like it too..",10,0,1,13 December 2005
Gone Baby Gone," Decent movie.
","First Casey Affleck, I'd seen him in 'Jesse James...' as coward Robert Ford and I thought 'hey man this guy is brilliant'. Now in Gone Baby Gone, h proves that I'm not wrong.Second, I really like the movie's easy and close to reality point of view. It frankly portrays Boston and people live in there. If I go there tomorrow, that is I'd see on the streets. I've seen similar neighborhoods before, similar looking people, thank god never witnessed such crime before but I can easily believe that this kinda sh*t do happen.Patrick Kenzie(Casey Affleck) and his partner as well as girlfriend Angie Gennaro(Michelle Monaghan) are private investigators. But they usually work for insurance companies/banks to find people whose avoiding to pay back their debts and such. One day a little girls gets kidnapped in their neighborhood. Patrick even knows the mother from high school. When little girls uncle and his wife come to Patrick and his partner to hire them to find the girl, Angie doesn't want to jump into the scene first but eventually she accepts it. If she only knew what's going to happen and how it'll change their lives...",7,1,5,5 February 2008
The Bourne Identity," A perfect spy movie
","Thank you Doug Liman for making the movie and thank you Matt Damon for this flawless action.I read critics that hate the movie and their main point of criticism is that movie does not follow the original novels' story. I have not read the book and therefore I really happy with the movie.I understand who read and loved the book, they normally expect the movie to 'be' like the book. But obviously director and Damon has chanced things (I mention Damon because he took part in fighting with the studio when they wanted the cut some of the scenes, but the director and Damon insisted keeping this scenes (farmhouse scenes) so, both the director and Damon believed in the movie.) And those changes created a easy to follow, always keeping your attention up movie but it also gives the plot and it's messages so clear.I always like American movies that are shot in Europe, the director used very nice views of roads, buildings, streets and so on, movie flows like a nice stream and it's logic never fails.Matt Damon is brilliant as always, he's playing his role in great confidence, fight scenes are very real, chase scene was nice and it reminds 'Italian Job' in a smart way.So, as a whole this movie is really good, sequels proofed to be better though.",8,2,2,26 November 2007
No Country for Old Men," Here again, a love or hate movie...
","No Country For Old Man: 'what a movie', I wish I could say that.At this time of writing it's got 8.7 rating here which is very high that pushed me to watch it again closely, read the message boards and some other comments. After doing all of my homework, I'm now pretty much convinced that here Cohen Brothers playing with us (the audience). They must have thought 'let's make another movie, it doesn't need to be sound or logical, hey wait it must not be, this way people can argue about it, talk about and it and it shall be hell of a success'.This movie gets it's story from a book which I did not read. Some say they've followed the book very closely, I doubt that actually. Because I think the book must be more deep and well structured, and reader find the meaning in the book which is not in the movie. I'm sure the book's author created more imaginative universe where the reader can relate Chigurh with devil, Moss with regular greedy man and Sheriff is in the middle of the story and old man fed up with life and sort of not pursuing things as he used to do.. So, all the story flows like a charm therefore the reader is satisfied, found some pieces going with his heart and everything is well done (I hope the book is like as I reckon). But the movie doesn't make you feel like this. It didn't for me! First part of the movie is very well paced, I even did forgive the stupidness of Moss going back to desert to give the man some water. But beginning of the second part everything starts to fall apart. There are so many illogical, unexplainable (even lovers of the movie can't) parts in this movie, most of them are written in the message board and in other comments. What I want to point out here is if you really try hard to put some meaning into it go ahead, but if you're searching anything in it, don't bother yourself because it's empty.It strangely feels as if Sheriff Bell is actually partnering with Chigurh as at many points Sheriff is avoiding to catch him. He's not going with other investigators, he mentions the cattle gun but doesn't get the trick and pursue it. Sheriff is like no one, he hasn't done anything actually.Having all this considered, I'm still suspicious if I'm missing anything, but I think it's more like lovers of the movie are the ones who is afraid of saying 'the king is naked'.",5,3,6,21 January 2008
City of God," Please, not that good...
","Well first of all I was expecting much more harsh movie, but City of God only disturbed me at some minor scenes (shooting small children etc.) but even those scenes were not so strongly shot.It's story is too long and hard to follow, even if you do follow it it becomes boring at the end.Maybe the problem is, the movie isn't trying to tell us anything but instead it merely shows (at least try to do so) life, crime and stuff at place called City of God. However while doing this, it portrays people (mostly children)too cartoonish, it feels like a tale more than a real life story.I must admit that I could not make it till the end cause I got bored..",Null,1,3,24 March 2008
Grindhouse," Bother yourself Not
","If there was a contest about 'who's gonna make the worst, not funny, bloody, stupid and full of bullshit movie' this movie and it's director could get a change, but no more than this.It's not funny, it's disgusting, it's stupid.If you say 'hey man that's the point', then, go to toilet and look at sh.. for one and half and hour. Write some critic about it, but sorry man I won't be here reading it.You see the movie had effect even on MEEE!!! Böö..It's pity that they've used meters of film, spent so much money on this.",3,0,2,28 November 2007
Heat," The most touching scene
","OK, I just wanna add this, when Hanna finds his stepdaughter in the bathtub committed to suicide but not death, takes her out, puts tampon on her wounds, he tells st like this 'everyday people die out there but why you do this'... this is a very touching scene for me considering his character and relationship with the girl.This is only one of many side stories that are perfectly developed throughout the movie. These little ones help the main story stream nicely. And yet none of them left stub or senseless.Thank you.",9,0,2,8 April 2006
Slumdog Millionaire," Slumdog
","How can you tell this kind of story without being boring or banal ? This way...Boyle takes a good script and crafts it into a greater movie. I also felt little bit disconnected with the story, it's reality etc. along the movie. But it somehow kept my attention up.I doubt if it's a 8 Oscar movie, but I think it really deserves 8 points and worth watching.. It's actually two sides, I think some satisfy their guilt by rewarding Oscars to this kind of movies (and nothing changes for slum people), on the other side, if you get any chance to awaken people about poverty in the World it's better to use that chance.",8,0,7,31 May 2009
Up in the Air," Very American but still good for everybody
","I had chance to see this after a while it's release. But I put stay on the couch amazed with movies' calm and hitting story. Firing people, getting fired? Look on the faces of the people that got fired and their disappointment? Who's gonna pay the bills? I'm a useless? What happened to all my dedication? Questions and questions popping into my mind while watching..Bingham (played by Coolney) is sure an a..hole. Sorry but he is. But he is also cursed to be lonely. He believes that is his own choice but I think it's just a curse. He got shocked when newbie Natalie (Anna Kendrick) comes with the idea to use the Internet to fire people instead of traveling across the country. I actually expected Bingham to got fired after this Internet thing, but it didn't happen.But about Alex (Vera Farmiga)? She is a real jack? Having a family with kids but getting layed by man whom she met in the bar or even at airports? She somehow lets the curse carry on him by disappointing him about marriage and attaching with people.Anyways, whatever side you look at it, Up In the Air makes you think carefully about many things for sure. Superb acting, nice and not pushy direction and a very nice movie about life and choices we make..",8,1,2,21 August 2010
