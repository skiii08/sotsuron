Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," very well done
","The special effects in this movie, by far the best ever to be produced, merely support a quality plot and acting.  The only part where special effects move beyond their bounds is with Jar Jar Binks, who, although he was an excellent technical achievement, could have been toned down a lot without losing anything important from the movie.  Other than that, the plot was very involving, and even though it moves along several different paths at first, they all come together at the end and set the stage for Episodes II-III.  The acting is really quite good also, despite what the so-called professional critics say.  Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Natalie Portman all give powerful presences to their respective roles.  Although many little-kid actors come across as fake and obnoxious, Jake Lloyd gives a good performance as the young Anakin.  His lines do not sound forced, and they are realistic for what a nine-year-old would say.  And to all the people who think that Anakin does not act 'special' enough--HE ISN'T SUPPOSED TO!!! The whole point of his downfall is that someone, even someone as kind and normal as Anakin, can stray down the dark path.  The menacing acting for Anakin will be left to the next two movies.",10,0,0,23 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," DEFINITELY WORTH IT
","Though almost all movies hyped as much as 'The Phantom Menace' are bound to be disappointing, this movie actually delivers.  The acting had been criticized as flat in initial reviews, while it was actually very involving, and similar to the style in episodes IV-VI that made them so popular.  The critics should remember that episode IV got bad initial reviews as well. The special effects are obviously king here, and they are spectacular; however, the acting keeps the movie going.  There was never a dull moment, and despite the somewhat-on-the-long-side length of 'The Phantom Menace,' (130 minutes) I never once found myself looking at my watch.  Do not go to this movie expecting a life-changing experience, but it is definitely worth going to as a very entertaining and well-made movie, sure to break all kinds of box-office records.",10,0,1,19 May 1999
