Mission: Impossible III," It was fun and definitely worth watching but...
","The thing about Mi3 is that it's a lot of fun and it's easy to watch. The explosions and fights are all in context and the action seems to flow. The problems lie in what are relatively unique flaws. Firstly though, i was happy that this one involved a bit more team work. Not a lot. But some. It was very clear that Ethan Hunt was not a lone ranger this time through and that is more in line with the mission impossible spirit. Still, this series--right from the start--has gone out of its way to defeat the purpose of the series. Basically, the mission impossibles have become James Bond with absolutely no differences whereas the original series was built on a team of people with their own unique skills. As for this movie as an 'artform' -- for lack of a better word -- it was lacking. Somehow they managed to write a script with several side plots while forgetting to have an actual plot. This works well in that the action can be ongoing. Since there is never an actual plot to develop there is nothing slowing the fight scenes down. Unfortunately this leaves the viewer with nothing to look back on. As soon as the movie was over I reflected on it and there was nothing to think about. Like a good roller coaster ride, I know I had fun, but there is just no substance to take with me when I go on my way. It's a shame because with all the money and history behind this franchise, it has the potential to be so much more.",6,0,1,11 November 2006
Stop-Loss," Sadly one sided...
","Caught this at the Canadian premier... Phillippe was there answering questions with the director and I was looking forward to something a lot more powerful than what I saw. The issue that it brought to light was definitely relevant, thought provoking, and powerful all on its own. The film, however, offered nothing new in the way of characters--meaning, we've seen this type of character in many other films, and they were often handled much better--and the story didn't really keep me entranced. Why? Because, the main issue, stop loss, was handled in a very one sided manner. The Q&A suggested that the director--and some in the audience--thought the issue really was played out in an open ended way, but really, it was just a bunch of policy bashing. Frankly, I agree with the films point of view, I just feel it loses all of it's meaning in how it was presented. Perhaps the clich√© nature of so much of the confrontations hurt it for me as well. I didn't care about the life the characters were to leave behind, etc, etc...Saying all of this, the performances were good for the parts. Some of the dialogue was exceptional (some... it had its moments) and the scenes that actually took place in the war were astounding. On a last thought, the director made a point of explaining that a lot of the inspiration came from the fact that many soldiers these days video and photograph every aspect of their lives, and edit them together with music and share them with the world--cameras mounted on their cars, guns, etc---and so much of the war footage was displayed this way. Frankly, I was upset more of the film didn't take its inpiration from the same styling.",5,64,136,25 February 2008
Hostel," softcore porn followed by inhumane acts...
","I understand the appeal of horror movies but can't understand people who view them as quality film. This isn't a movie about a story and a plot and characters with motivations. This is spectacle. There is nothing inherently wrong with spectacle but I sure wish it were viewed for what it is. Critics attack these movies because they think they're movies. So the reviews will be pretty shoddy. I watched it against my will and found it to be just that. While I enjoy spectacles from time to time, a lot of great ones of crossed the screen, I just can't sit back and enjoy a show where the only purpose is to show you how realistic we can make this gross stuff look. And again, I enjoy porn on occasion. What the heck, right? But... Hostel pretty much takes us through 40 minutes of soft core sex scenes for no real reason at all. It's filler. It's to make it look like there's more to the movie then dismemberment. Ugh.... I'm done now. And yes I realize this comment is pretty useless for the mostpart but i wanted the opportunity to vent. Save your money and watch gross stuff on TV for free.",1,19,39,4 January 2006
Corpse Bride," The Best Parts Weren't There...
","I enjoyed this movie for the entertainment it was and therefore gave it a relatively high rating. Beyond mere entertainment, however, this movie just can't stack up to the expectations that go along with a Burton film, let alone a film from anyone who spent so long laboring on such a project. Little issues I have with the film are its errors in consistency, so to speak. When in the land of the dead Victor and his Bride are unable to get back to the surface and have to seek out the elder for a solution. Now, aside from the magic of love, this leaves unexplained how she managed to chase victor through the town after he put the ring on her finger. Now, my biggest complaint is that I feel the best part of the story was virtually left out. When telling the story of the Corpse Bride in song, and how she came to be, I was taken back by the beautiful possibilities this could have presented. As soon as the song was done I found myself asking why we didn't get to WATCH that part of the story instead of just hearing about it. I couldn't help but thing that her story was far more intriguing--as fairy tails go--then Victor's and I was left wishing that HIS story was left as the side plot. Most anything else I have to say, praises included, have already been said. Though I will leave with one last comment which I admit is entirely subjective on my part. I liked the songs, but didn't love the songs. I feel the movie, even as it was, would have been more fun for me had it been a non-musical.OH Lord Burton, please forgive my blasphemy.

Avatar," Okay... torn between great cinema and a great movie
","This is no doubt a great piece of cinema. The visuals are gorgeous and the effects are incredible and on a whole, this is by far worth the admission price.That being said, the plot is thin and the characters are thinner. The foreshadowing is often shoved in your face and there is little exploration into what could have been wonderfully unique characters. Essentially, the plot is the Last Samurai on a distant planet. The characters are stuck somewhere between honoring Native American culture and insulting it.If this were just some run of the mill Hollywood flick, those things would be easy to overlook--or at least forgivable. In a movie that was over a decade in the making, costing more than almost any other film, and introducing such glorious cinema, it's just a real shame that everything to do with the script was so carelessly put together.Again, see it. If these things don't bother you, you are very lucky and will end up having one of the best cinematic experiences of your life. If they do bother you, you'll nonetheless love the ride. But don't believe the reviews that don't see past the imagery. There's more to film than that.",6,24,45,20 December 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Truly great addition
","First of all, hats of to George for redeeming himself. Sowly but surely. Episode one was garbage, Two was enjoyable and three was truly a great addition to the legend. My only real complaint is, as in most of the Star Wars, the dialogue is often horrible. It saddens me that with all the money spent on these films he couldn't get himself a script supervisor with intelligence enough to know that 'I can't watch anymore' and 'Oh Anikan, oh,' are good ways to interrupt the flow. That said, unlike the other two prequels we actually learn a few things in this one, including answers to some questions raised by 'non disappearing Jedi' from episode 1. Watching everything unfold towards the end of this film was like getting closure on wounds brought forth in childhood. Add to that the incredible style it was done in and I'm willing to call it a masterpiece. I'm confident that my future Star Warsathons will begin with this movie from now on. 1 and 2 will be a rarity though. But this definitely deserves presence.",9,1,4,19 May 2005
