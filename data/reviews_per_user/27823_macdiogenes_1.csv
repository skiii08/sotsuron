Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," please, only writersblock
","Lucas did it twenty years ago. Invented a marvelous mythological place in a galaxy far away. But not so long ago, in a place much nearer he ignored the masses that enjoyed his fantasies so much and gave the children of today a new line of irritating toys. But we, who grew up up with star wars and rented it again and again, talked and adored that universe, we got nothing but the bitter taste of digital dissapointment. Nowhere were the fantastic imagination that flowed so vividly in the classic trilogy to be found in the bland ruin of droids and silly xenomorphs from jamaica, not even a believeble darker-than-life archenemy could be mustered up, only a laughable Jackie Chan-wannabe. And why, why was the starfight so amateurish? Lucas invented the starfight, but now was it even worse than the ones in early Star Trek:TNG episodes. Well, it is the first part in a new trilogy, and maybe Lucas is just rusty in the ways of the interstellar world. Because in the following episodes that cute little boy have to be corrupted and evil, and that will be hard to do in the childishly cheerie mood of episode I.",Null,0,1,11 April 2000
