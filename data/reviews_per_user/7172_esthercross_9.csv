Blade Runner 2049," this film appreciates lurid yellow almost as much as me
","I found the atmosphere of the 1985 'Blade Runner' uniquely unsettling yet strangely moreish so I was delighted to feel that many qualities of the Original had been seamlessly carried over. The film managed to really capture the chilling magnitude of the over industrialised dystopian world. There was an eye feast of fascinating sculptures and settings. What the film achieved so well was very cinematic contrasts. The early on flight sequences show the domineering shapes of the city and the air itself is muddy with pollution. An effective backdrop for the lurid, neon lights of the leering Japanese commercials. When 'K's mission takes him to the Wallace Corporation the murky landscape changes to sharp clean architectural lines and set choices that are impressive works of art. The film managed to achieve an extraordinary art-house feel despite its blockbuster proportions. I know what will not go by unmentioned in most reviews; the frequency of breasts in this film. In my opinion I don't feel that the film was misogynous in tone for its use female nudity and subservient artificial intelligence. I think the points when woman where sexualised, where grotesque in tone to highlight how our future world has the potential for excessive objectification in its quest to fulfil an uncontrolled appetite for fantasy. It also fits in with the dystopian sense of excessive up-scaling. The twists and turns of the story kept my mind enticed and I didn't notice the sneaky extra hour added to the conventional running time. The plot manages to smartly swerve any predictable plot points. The creativity alone would have kept me satisfied but the film for me managed to deliver the on all elements. 'Blade Runner 2049' also has a fantastic score which pulled me fully into the story and I could feel the mechanical tonality and bass reverberating through my chair!",10,3,9,29 October 2017
It," Chessy like a cheese sandwich made with an entire wheel of cheese.
","I went to see 'IT' armed ready with the criticism of the film not being scary enough, and tried to view it as suggested- a mildly chilling adventure story. The problem with changing my point of view to suit this film is that I could really sense the makers trying like a dad in a Halloween costume to scare the audience. Since the films monster lives and thrives of fear it seemed strange to me that the film itself didn't engage the concept of generating suspense. There were many moments where the changing manifestation of IT would pop out of nowhere and try and be 'scary' with out much lead up and I just wasn't buying it. These scary creature sequences had my mind distracted with thinking 'this is a person in a costume doing a silly walk'. I think it was definitely a fault of the film to show too much and too quickly. I was really hoping for the, 'breath on the back of the neck' atmosphere you get when the impending horror slowly creeps up on you but I was was almost never transported into the world where these threats exist. There were definitely problems with the script. Whilst I found many of the characters likable and interesting; I did find that I wasn't convinced in people's reactions to events in the film. Moments after something grotesquely horrific happened the characters seemed to make miraculous emotional recoveries. The film had the sensibility of a cheesy 80's quest film but without the charm of it being actually made in the the 80's. If this film was made a few decades ago, i'd probably have grown up fondly ignoring the errors however, it wasn't and therefore I cannot ignore the clunky flow of the film, the lack of fear and the cheese on toast that was the dialogue. As much as this film wasn't for me I do have to praise how it kept me entertained even when sceptical as the worst thing a film can be is boring and 'IT' never was. I also thought there was an amazing craft behind appearance of 'IT' as he was beautifully Gothic looking like an Pagliacci clown, and was striking with every appearance! I also really enjoyed the performance of Sophie Lilis who had a captivating charm about her and I thought her challenging range of emotions where convincing. What 'IT' does have going for it; is a really great score and an empowering message about strength, bravery and uniting as a team.",5,1,3,27 September 2017
Wind River," I felt so empty after I had to have a share bag of M&Ms
","Half way throw watching this film my sister turned to me and said 'Is it freezing in here or is it just the snow?'. Now I, too was feeling chilly to the marrow of my bones but less to do with the snowy visuals and more to do with the relentlessly sombre atmosphere of the film. I would go as far as to say I left with frost bite of the soul. I have heard it said from critics that the desolate portrayal of this story was perhaps daring and effective but as an audience member I felt stretched to my limits without moments of relief. The beautiful wide shots of snowy Wyoming where reminding me that I'd rather be watching an arctic episode of Planet Earth, at least our David Attenborough actually enunciates. One big issue I found with this film was that I couldn't understand what the characters where saying! The audio quality just wasn't sharp enough but even when I was understanding I found the conversations about grief too over-laboured. I think in order to establish real poignancy in these more emotional scenes there needs to be some light and shade in the films presentation. I think if the film had established some contrasting scenes with moments of comedy or warmth then I would have felt more emotionally invested in the film during the tragic moments. I don't understand why the film was presenting as a murder mystery because in reality the reveal at the end felt like a presentation of the information we already new from the start.",2,26,67,13 September 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," This film was pure gold(blum)
","It is one of those marvellous films that place no strain on your focus because it is relentlessly entertaining. It still looks very much like a marvel film but has somehow managed to achieve a superb balance of combining the dry humoured, quirky identity of a smaller Waititi film with the large marvel proportions. There seemed to be a different comedic set up in each scene almost like a sketch show and in general the film felt almost more like a comedy then an action film in terms of genre. It was really great to see Chris Hemsworth showing his skills as a comedy actor and it wasn't just down to the moments of genius within the written dialogue as Hemsworth shows he has a really funny instinct and great use of physical humour. A great quality of the film too was how meta and self deprecating the characters where and it gave the villains in particular more depth. This was particularly in the case of 'Hella' (Cate Blanchett). Hellas darkness and power are presented alongside moments that ridicule her failed attempts to demand respect. The film also uses its special effects in a spectacularly creative ways. When Hellas Hair turns to horns it is a beautifully fluid action that for some reason caused certain people in the screen I was in to exclaim 'GO KATE' I don't think they necessarily thought it was the actress's personal skill, but I understand the sentiment. her whole performance was great! there is something about her which really commands your full focus whenever she is on screen. My only criticism would be I would have liked to have seen more Blanchet. I also really felt with this film that the SciFi moments where constructed with great tangibility. Everything in this film looked touchable and correctly weighted which is rare for a glossary high CGI Blockbuster. There is a visually interesting scene taking place in a festival for the Hulk and everything looked like a real life spectacle and yet had the convincing feel of a far away planet. I think what Waititi proves with this film is that he is very accomplished as an action director as well as with comedy as he uses the action sequences to showcase his creative ingenuity. In a flash back scene the texture of the action is that of an old dramatic oil painting in which a fight involving the Valkyries is taking place. The dramatic lighting design in this scene beautifully impressive. Whether a marvel nerd a Waititi fan a comedy snob or just someone who needs escaping into another world for a few hours; this film is well worth the watch!",Null,1,8,17 November 2017
Baby Driver," Edgar got this one 100% wright (dya see what I did there)
","There was an infectious energy about the film the moment it started. SO many films have opening scenes which have my mind peddling hard to try and become absorbed by the story but with Baby Driver, I didn't have to put any effort into getting completely and utterly sucked in!It was definitely like watching a musical without singing numbers and the beat and theatrical choreography of the film felt like something I hadn't experienced before. I think whilst the film has a cracking script I thought that what the film explored most was ulternate forms of communication outside of scripted dialogue. There were poignant and humorous moments with sign language and often the lyrics in the songs would say something of a scene the actor wouldn't have to.It is a familiar feature of Edgar Wrights work to max out on visual communication and it was great to see Baby Driver upholding this trade mark. As an audience member who is not a natural fan of the car chase genre, I was actually very taken with the action in this movie it was very exhilarating and creative. The characters are so well written and watchable, it makes the stakes and tension much higher when experiencing them engage in an intense car chase. This film has many experimental uses of music and it's truly refreshing to see this kind of innovation with film making.Kevin spacey has great presence as usual, his characterisation was deliciously layered and has a suave atmosphere about him. I also enjoyed the energy of Lily James' performance it had a buoyant innocence about it and she was great to watch. I've often heard it said that Edgar wright has a presence in his films almost like an extra character and it is very true in the case of Baby Driver. You can almost feel him conducting the film as it flows and cracking jokes from the back seat.",10,1,3,24 July 2017
Dunkirk," I came out of this film with no nails left to bite
","I would prescribe that anyone going to see Dunkirk bring with them 1) a defibrillator 2) strong anti perspirant 3) a stiff drink for afterwards. (Oh and some tissues for the end when Elgar accosts your already tattered emotions!)Going into this film I was emotionally under-prepared for such a fiercely evocative experience! The film is an immediate sensory explosion and has your heart beating at an alarming rate pretty much within the first 5 minutes. When I came out of the cinema I had bite marks in my knuckle and here's the magic formula for how you put exhilarating and slightly cruel levels of tension on your audience. First off the music has a constant ticking beat which seems to slowly become more frantic as the film progresses. Han Zimmer manages also to interweave an almost mechanical quality into the score which ramps up the tension especially when there is large scale damage. The quality of the ambient sound and shots made me feel scarily involved in the unrelenting Dunkirk conditions. The shots were so wide and dynamic it felt at times like virtual reality. There are three different stories that cleverly interweave as the film progresses; Land, Sea and Air. Land is explored over the course of a week, the sea explored over a day and Air over the course of an hour. As the stories weave together you are often pulled between three different perilous scenarios. I love how Nolan play's with around with time lines in his films and I thought it was a very original concept to have three different time frames in one film.Dunkirk did an impressive job of capturing the immensity of the damage as we experience ships being torpedoed and sinking from various terrifying angles and perspectives. In amongst these large scale sequences though the film also hones in well on the micro moments. There where some beautiful facial reactions that expressed real depth of emotion without the need of dialogue. I think the film had an interesting presentation because as Christopher Nolan said in an interview he wanted the whole story to be very present tense and there was no focus on backstory. Some people disliked this approach to character presentation but I thought it worked well for the film that everything was happening in the moment. There are some very breathtaking sky shots in this film and when the planes where diving I can say I felt on the cusp of queasy. Definitely catch this film on a huge screen with an all guns blazing sound system as you will feel the bombs and music in your seat! A fantastic film and a very emotional ending (bring tissues or at the very least a porous sleeve)",10,7,18,26 July 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," couldn't warm to fantastic beasts..
","I was hoping to feel impressed by this film. We all cherish the harry potter world I think because there are so many warming intricate details that make the story feel real. Fantastic beasts -in my opinion- however failed to be as inventive or as detailed it felt like the up-scaling had lost some of the intimacy and I didn't feel attached to any of the characters at all. I definitely feel that I would have rather the story happen on a smaller scale and that the the world within the film establish itself, because at times it felt negatively like a glossy block buster. I said I wouldn't get stuck on drawing comparisons BUT. The Philosophers Stone though. Even if I had an extraordinary amount hands I still wouldn't be able to count on my fingers how many times I have seen the 1st harry potter film. It is great! I wouldn't however, feel motivated to watch Fantastic Beasts again. I think the fist harry potter film is considerably better even though within this film there were no impressive graphics or big action sequences that the fantastic beasts film relies upon. The world we entered in the Philosophers stone feels magically absorbing and the pace of the narrative in the first half of the film gives us the space to to get to know the amazingly well written characters, as fans we are pleasantly convinced by all of it! I was expecting this same tone when I went to see fantastic beasts but I felt very alienated by the action in this film which wasn't inventive enough to justify itself. Watching Fantastic Beasts kind of felt like watching a friend become filthy rich and because of it loosing some sense of their personality. I also felt that some of the darker scenes with Credence and Graves wasn't developed so well. Both Farrell and Millar are amazing actors but something felt a bit off about the scenes. I don't disagree with the actual content being uncomfortable to watch as I like to be effected as an audience member in many different ways! I just felt it was executed a bit awkwardly and it could have been better. There are good things I could say of this film but they are obvious merits and I am not feeling motivated to detail them. Obviously costume - FAB. Set design - NAILED IT. The rain scene I thought was very touching and I liked Queenie Goldstein she was exquisite! I really don't want to neglect mentioning our Eddie but I don't have a lot to say because despite him being the only person who should play newt and doing a scrumptious job of the characterisation, I wasn't captivated by the story around him and so I feel unsure how I feel about his role within the film, but my love and admiration for Eddie remains undying!",5,1,3,26 November 2016
American Made," garishly top class colour grading
","Whenever there is any kind of historical, political or cartel speak in a film; my brain turns to soft cheese, and so I cannot rely in great depth the full plot of American Made. I think however this fact makes it even more significant that I LOVED this film. I have watched so many dull and uninventive films recently so I may find myself a bit overzealous in my review but I did have fun! Right from the first moment; the shots where visually interesting and snappy. Barry seals' restless cot pit antics comically establishes the job apathy and dangerous gusto that leads to the characters illicit journey. Tom cruises skilled but naive character becomes swept up in seemingly impossible missions (sorry I just had to) to ship illegal goods over seas with the constant threat of death and incarceration. The film however doesn't take itself too seriously and at some moments becomes a bit ridiculous, which only added to my levels of enjoyment. There where many creative, teetering on surreal, features of this film. The highly saturated shots in the first half made everything look stylised and vibrant and even in a very functional shot there is plenty of lurid feasts. The garish early on shots I think where to mimic the hyper-real grading of 80s video cameras. As the film progressed the colour quality got progressively more modern and I thought this was a very innovative way of presenting the time frame of the film. My favourite section was the over the top montage with a spectacularly excessive classical music remix playing as Barry and his wife are dining out on their wealth in the most ostentatious ways possible. Another very mention-able part of the film was Domhnal Gleeson and his charming, weaselly performance as the CIA agent trying to entangle Seal in the films daring operations. To be fair to Seal if Gleeson had approached me with those levels of biting Charisma I probably would have been shipping Crack and Weaponry to Miami myself.",7,1,5,17 September 2017
Mother!," Haunted most by the regimented linen draw
","I had read enough to be deterred on reasonable grounds from watching this film so I went in with my expectations around shin level but exited to get a slice of the scandal. The conditions where perfect I was on the front row of an impressive screen with sound quality reverberating in my bones I was completely thrust into the mother house where the whole story takes place. The audio in this film is very effective, even the quieter sounds get eerily under your skin. For anyone who takes to YouTube for the ASMR videos, then the noise quality of Jennifer Laurence mixing paint shades will massage your ear drums royally. J-law's character 'Her' (as credited) represents an purely natural entity with garden of Eden updoo's and clothed in crisp Cotten whites. The grading and texture quality of this film early on is almost oily, like a still life painting - the serene calm before humanities gory metaphorical decline. Very early on we see her mixing powders and spreading them lovingly on the wall and giving the same attentive warmth to her cold husband. The more we see her nurturing the house the more we feel her becoming dangerously intertwined within the very fabric of the home. There has been question over the genre of this film, whether or not it slots into the horror genre. I certainly felt a bizarre discomfort during this film. Not just because 'Her' life is snatched up by chaos but because of the lifeless, inescapable beige prison 'Her' was creating around herself. The moment she opens the militantly ordered linen draw it makes you feel the sting of unease when even just one unannounced guest arrives, let alone the horrors to come. The unresolved conflict for me in this film was how the seemingly picturesque woodland house was lacking in humanity but when the humans arrive a different kind of horror erupts and you get a sense that there is no optimum ground to be found within this story and this made me feel relentlessly uncomfortable. 'Mother!' Is very much like watching a piece of instillation theatre where it doesn't seem like there is a substantial plot but it certainly feels like you are in amongst the escalating action. I felt a certain degree of motion sickness coming out of this film as the camera seems to make a lot of quick spiralling shots. It almost almost mimics the snapping round of the head when you hear a sound over your shoulder. Very effective, but also very effective in making me feel slightly woozy. For me; 'mother!' felt like something I hadn't experienced before, it was fearless and left me exhausted and for that I have to give 'mother!' my respect.",8,3,10,7 October 2017
