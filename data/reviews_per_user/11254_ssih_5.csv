The Longest Yard," How can you not compare?
","Everyone is instructing us not to compare the current to the original version. How is that possible? That's like going to a restaurant, being served a lousy steak, and being asked that you not compare it to other good steaks that you've had in the past.To any guy who was watching movies in the 70's, The Longest Yard is legendary. Burt can act big enough and mean enough to convince us that he could survive, and become a leader, in the prison community. Adam Sandler is Happy Gilmore, The Waterboy, Billy Madison and Little Nicky. He can't pull off the ex-NFL quarterback gaining cred in the joint. It was simply bad casting.The rest of the casting, beginning to end, was superb. Most of the writing, and the additional comedy, was great fun. But Adam Sandler? Why not Woody Allen? The movie really needed someone that can pull off 'tough'. Josh Holloway, aka 'Sawyer' on the TV show 'Lost' might have been a good choice.If they didn't want us to compare it to the original, they shouldn't have remade it.",5,5,8,13 November 2005
BASEketball," I laughed so hard, I... Wait a sec... No I didn't.
","I expected little from this film and got much much less.  I really don't care WHAT these to guys did before.  I don't care if they cured cancer. They were abysmal in this movie, and I'll be sure to avoid anything else that they act in.This movie insults the intelligence of anyone with an IQ even approaching triple digits.  The acting was lame, the jokes were obvious or non-existant.I only made it an hour and 15 minutes into the film.  At that point, I said to my wife, 'I can't take this any more.' and she replied, 'Oh, thank God.'",Null,6,14,26 June 2004
No Country for Old Men," The Emperor's New Clothes
","Like others have said, I was swayed by the ultra-high rating this garnered. It stars about 300 actors that I respect, and the Coen Bros - well, say no more!! But when it was all over, my wife and I were asking ourselves if our time might have been better spent re-grouting the bathroom tile.The four stars I gave it were primarily due to Tommy Lee Jones, who does a better job on his worst day (i.e., this film) than on most actors' best. He's done this role several times before, and simply added a 'burnt-out and tired' twist to it. Some of the down-home good ol' boy banter was fun.But aside from that...I don't mind letting reality slide if I'm watching movies like Star Trek, or Dracula, but I got the impression that this wasn't intended to be based on the supernatural. What was this gas tank that the murderer was carrying around? It managed to blow holes through deadbolts without his hand twitching. I'm no physicist, but most people should have a vague grasp of the 'equal and opposite reaction' principle.And while I understand that he had that nifty Radio Shack transponder, it did nothing but beep. But somehow it managed to bring him right to the correct hotel. And even without the transponder, he magically divined that Llewelyn Moss went to Mexico.Woody Harrelson shared the same clairvoyance, as he was able to walk to where Moss tossed the money and figure out where he threw it. Agent Fox Mulder would have been impressed.And as clever as Llewelyn Moss was, you'd think that once he found the transponder in the money, he might - you know - toss it out the window? Maybe on top of a moving truck? Nah - that would be cheating. And when the killer is standing on the other side of the door, he cleverly remains directly in the obvious line of fire. The only thing he didn't do was to yell, 'I'm right here!' I can only explain all of the high ratings on the fact that the Coen Brothers did the film, and they obviously can't do any wrong. If I didn't like the movie, it must be that I didn't understand it, and I'll be damned if I'll let the world know that I don't have the necessary depth to appreciate this obvious masterpiece.",4,16,28,19 February 2008
I Am Legend," One star for Will, one for the effects and one for the dog
","We've got ratings to protect children from graphic violence, sex and other 'adult' themes. We really need the same thing to protect adults from mindless dreck that can only be withstood by teenagers. This was such a film.I'm giving this film three stars. One for Will Smith (this movie wasn't really his strong suit, but he still had his moments), one for the special effects, and one for the dog (just because I like dogs, and this was a very handsome dog).I understand that science fiction films require a certain departure from logic, but this film was simply off the charts. Examples: Only three years had passed and we have wheat growing in the main thoroughfares. There are herds of deer. Where did THESE come from? I'll buy that there might have been a few in Central Park, but... Manhattan appears to be full of zombies. With Will Smith as the only human, what are they all eating?I could go on and on...The scene with the deer galloping down Broadway was beaten to death in the promos, so that's nothing new. Beyond that, the plot was tedious and unbelievable. The chemistry between Smith's character and Anna was non-existent. Will Smith should stick to what he does well - being the coolest guy in the room. When there's no one else in the room, he's got no snark.When it came down to it, it was just Night of the Living Dead with special effects and a comedian trying to be a dramatic actor.",3,0,0,20 June 2008
Vanilla Sky," Overused dreams killed it for me
","One of the favorite ploys of Hollywood (and one of my pet peeves) is the use of dream sequences.  Sometimes it's a necessary thing and they'll make it obvious that you're looking at a dream (reverbed sound, surrealistic surroundings).  But all too often, the dream sequence is just the movie's way to lead you to believe that an amazing thing is happening, and then say 'GOTCHA!!  Just kidding...' when the actor wakes up.This is the problem that I had with Vanilla Sky.  Yes, I understand that dreams were a critical plot element, but I like to get caught up in the story and try to figure out what is happening.  During the course of this movie, I ultimately got sick of being duped and just sat back, waiting for the end of the film to come and tell me the punchline.That said, I didn't think that the movie was a waste of my time.  The cinematography and soundtrack were terrific.  Aside from Tom Cruise (who should stick with action films like Impossible Mission sequels), I thought that the entire cast was great.  Ok...  when the camera was on Penelope Cruz, I sort of lost my reasoning abilities, but I'm guessing she did ok.Perhaps I'd like it better the second time when I have a clue about what's going on.",Null,0,0,3 July 2002
