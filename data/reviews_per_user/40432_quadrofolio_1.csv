Black Swan," Most boring movie ever!
","Although the acting was generally fine the movie was a waste of my time and I am pretty sure of your too. I guess you must be a fan of ballet to appreciate this movie but I think even a ballet fan would find this movie excruciating. You constantly feel like you want to slap the main character out of her pathetic persona. It's all very winy and overly dramatic without even the slightest hint of a interesting story developing. Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis and Vincent Cassel all put in a very descent performance and especially Mila Kunis surprised me as the only interesting character in the movie. I am a big fan of Natalie but this movie was not made for a broad audience and I am fairly certain I am not in it. I must admit I saw a trailer with the scene of Natalie and Mila in a passionate bed scene and was looking forward to seeing this movie but that scene was clearly the only thing this movie had going for it. Do not watch, whatever you do.",1,28,88,22 December 2010
