The Blair Witch Project," Intelligently Done Movie That Gives You Decent Goosebumps!
","The movie 'Blair Witch Project' is a remarkably well done movie. Now, I am slightly confused with my own statement here. Because, there is not much done in this movie. I shall elaborate on what I mean a bit later on. But let me briefly summarize that this movie is indeed a scary movie that does give you the scares and the goosebumps that one expects from a scary movie. But the beautiful part of this movie is that it does not give you typical ghosts, ghouls and monsters as found in this movie. It taps on the fact that you are more afraid of the unknown rather the known. And this is the greatest strength of the movie.The movie is about a collection of tapes. The movie starts out by stating that three kids had gone into a certain forest searching for what is simply known as the Blair Witch. They have never seen her but almost everybody has heard about her. The movie says that the kids were never found but their tapes were found and all we are shown in the movie is the tape recording of the adventure the kids went on. The movie does not have a cameraman. It is all recorded by the three kids who are the only major cast in this movie. Other people appear for only 2 or 3 minutes at the very beginning of the movie.There is a certain rumor surrounding this movie that it is real. Many people believe that the tapes are authentic. I recommend you read the detailed and elaborate article on www.wikipedia.org which clearly explains the methods adopted by the producers of this movie to advertise this movie. The producers actually placed advertisements reporting the three lead actors as missing. This has led many people to believe and also spread the rumor that Blair Witch project is real. Well, it is not. The movie's strength is that it shows you fear. The lead characters are scared of their experiences and fear shines on them. But if you have read about the movie in detail, you very well know that the fear on the characters' faces is genuine. They did go to the forest and instead of making them act, the director actually decided to scare them and thus the fear you see on their faces is genuine. So, for the genuine emotions of fear, frustration and tension you see on the characters, I'd prefer giving credit to the director. After all, he made the decision of making half of their experiences seem real to them. I don't know if it is a cruel way of making a movie but it works. The audience is scared and the movie is meant to do that. The most scary thing about the movie to me was the stick figures they find in the forest. This really heightens the overall tension in the movie. The characters have lost their way in the forest and are doing the balancing act between consoling each other and also taking out their anger on each other. Each blames the other for their state of misery. We get to see genuine anger, frustration, fear and eventual terror in this movie. A very 'well done' movie indeed. Highly recommended for watching especially in the dark and preferably alone!",8,0,1,10 October 2008
Angels & Demons," Could Have Been Better! Yet, Decent As It Is!
","Each and every person I speak to about this movie turns out to be someone who has had the time to read the novel by Dan Brown of the same name on which this movie is based. And each person gives a report about the movie and at the end of it says only one thing - 'The novel is far better.' And before I say anything about the movie, there is this comment that I would like to make about the people who, not only about this movie but also about other movies based on popular novels, have to say - 'The novel is much better.' Once in our Science class we were cheerfully told not to add buffaloes to sheep. (To illustrate a concept called dimensional analysis.) The relevance here is that it is very unfair to any movie to keep uplifting the novel and lower the level of appreciation for a movie.How do you compare the two media? One medium has the luxury of spreading all that there is to know across 600 pages and maybe even more of pages that are printed in small font-size. This same medium has the luxury of spending as much time as possible to develop the characters and give them dimensions that the readers can identify with. If the author decides to introduce something bordering on being crap, he has all the pages in the world pouring out necessary text to make it sound convincing to the common reader. What can a movie do? Each second of a movie has some thousand dollars of expenditure behind it. The length has to be limited. What will a movie maker do? He cannot deliver your novel on the screen word-to-word. I do not believe in the comparison. It is lame and meaningless to me and hence I do not like to hear the phrase - 'The novel is better.' Yes, it is lame for me to hear text and reader imagination being compared to the difficulty of direction, scripting, visual effects, sound, etc. working to in sync to tell a story.Now, coming to the movie Angels and Demons, it obviously changes the story so that it may fit into the time limits of a movie. I ask the question - 'Is there anything believable about the plot of the movie?' No. There is hardly anything that is quite believable. But does that make it a bad movie? The answer is again a no. Surprisingly, in spite of sheer lack of believability this movie entertains and excites. And especially for the person who has not had the chance to see the Vatican, gives a wonderful tour of the city. The photography is damn amazing. It gives a wonderful portrayal of a city filled with beautiful structures that are symbols of the vast history of that land.Tom Hanks' character has not great dimensions to it. There really was no challenge for an actor of his caliber in the movie. After all the hard work and concentration he had to do in all his other movies, here is a role that really did not demand the actor to use his skills to the fullest. He probably did it because he enjoyed playing the role in The Da Vinci Code. The other members of the cast do their jobs well. There are some short comings in the script time to time where things get a little too absurd but the movie pulls on somehow.The sheer speed of the story is too much. And it is this speed that takes out a lot of believability from the movie. But then, there are so many other movies that break this law by showing a race against time. So, why condemn this one? Just because it is based on a popular book that seems to have too many hardcore fans? Don't get me wrong! All I am trying to say is the the movie does a good job in giving you an overall idea of the plot. Sure, it may not develop its characters for that would compromise on the excitement and urgency of the situation. But what about the photography? The Sound? The effects? They are all well done.On a personal level, I myself would love to see a lot of changes to the movie perhaps to make the plot more real. But then the movie would contend to satisfy critics and loses its viewers. Overall, a good watch!",8,2,3,15 June 2009
The Ring," Horror with Depth!
","Before I saw The Ring, I used to think of horror movies as something about a supernatural (sometimes not supernatural) force that gobbles up people in bizarre series of deaths usually accompanied by blood and gore. Maybe I ought to blame it on my own selection of movies. But I realized that horror movies can have a deep and a decent story line after seeing The Ring.The Ring is an adaptation of the Japanese movie Ringu. Ringu is a well respected horror movie. Rather than call The Ring as an adaptation I would prefer calling it as an improvisation of Ringu. For I have seen both movies and in my personal opinion the producers of The Ring have made the story a bit deeper and of course with the music and special effects scarier.A particular thing worth mentioning is the work done by the child actor David Dorfman (playing the role of Aidan). My personal opinion is that he has done a very good job. And Ehren Kruger, in his script for the movie has given a major role to Aidan as opposed to lesser important role given to Aidan's Japanese counterpart.Full credit to the Ring's makers for a very fine adaptation of the original Ringu. And yes, a small word of advice for those who have not seen the real Daveigh Chase (playing Samara). After seeing this movie, do look up on the net for a picture of hers and make the comparison! And do try and watch Ringu as well. A very respectable movie indeed.A good story, nice scares, decent acting and smooth direction! Enjoy the movie!",10,95,117,1 February 2007
Rocky V," Good movie done wrongly!
","Coming straight to the point, if Stallone was planning to make Rocky V as the final installment in the Rocky series he should have put in more effort and been more careful in handling the subtleties of the movie. Stallone did come up with a creative idea to take the Rocky series in a different direction but I guess he failed to deliver everything right. Although I must make it very clear in the beginning itself that I do not rate this movie as bad as many others have.First of all, let me relax myself by taking out my frustration on the music. Music is one of the most important factors that characterizes the Rocky movies. Right from the first film to the fourth Rocky movies are known to give stunningly energetic music. This was totally missing in Rocky V. All music in Rocky V was rap. I mean no insult to rap music or rap musicians but the music just did not fit. It was a shocker for me when I heard the Rocky V tracks at a friend's place.Some people have expressed their disagreement with the very idea of Rocky losing all his money, house and all and coming back to the old neighborhood. I felt that was okay but how it was eventually handled was not so effective. It always could have been done in a better way. Scripting was not so effective, I must admit. As I said, more effort was needed in handling subtleties. When you have decided that a world famous boxer was going from riches back to rags you ought to think hard about every word and every scene.Stallone did a remarkable job by ripping the financial power of Rocky for this created room for large number of ways in which the movie could be taken forward. But where the movie scored low was Stallone not being able to capitalize on the room that was created. I felt that if this movie would have been longer I would not have a problem but my gut feeling says that there was a scope for handling things in a much better way.Stallone creates a challenging character for himself in Rocky V. But he does not deliver the best performance in comparison to his performance in other movies. He does a decent job though with regards to the parts dealing with Rocky's strained relationship with his son. This was, to me, the best part of the movie - the whole portrayal of the father-son relationship, of course ignoring the direction glitch of the sudden aging of Rocky Jr. Sage Stallone did a decent job with his acting considering it was a debut film.Rocky V had its other positives apart from the father-son relationship. One of them being the words of Micky Goldmill recalled by Rocky. 'Get up, you son of a bitch! Cause Micky loves ya!' was amazing to me. And one thing the movie did manage to do to me was to make me hate Tommy Gunn so much that I could not help but scream out loud during the end fight, 'Take him down, Rocky' A decent movie with a good story but just not executed well!",6,2,4,3 February 2007
Hostel," Remarkably gory!
","OK. It is one of those movies that basically does not have a story or a deep plot. So, for those movie goers who like to rack their brains about what happens next, like twists and turns in movies, this movie is definitely not for you.But yes, if you are on of those who'd just like to see a movie for fun without bothering too much about the intricacies of the plot, script and the story line, then you are welcome to watch it.And if you want to watch this movie, then kindly make sure you are not weak at heart and also make sure that you do not get offended by sexual content.The plot may be summed up as follows : Three guys, looking for fun in the form of women, end up in the wrong place. Why is the place wrong? People are allowed to be tortured by other rich people who are willing to pay for the same.Initial part of the movie is loaded with erotic content. And the latter part of the movie with incredible gore. And the reason why I have given this movie a 6 is only because of the boldness the film makers have shown in depicting certain scenes. Sometimes I can't help wondering whether the movie makers really had the fingers of the actors cut!!! And a word of warning, make sure the weaker ones NEVER see this movie. Very high on blood and gore.Cheers!",6,2,4,30 January 2007
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Jordan Mechner disappoints. So does Mike Newell.
","When the announcement was made on the Internet that a movie was going to be made based on the superb and incredibly well done game called Prince of Persia - Sands of Time, it was also announced that none other than Jordan Mechner was roped in to write the script and screenplay. Jordan Mechner is, for those who are not too sure, the inventor of the concept of Prince of Persia. Prince of Persia is a game franchise that started out with the DOS based 1989 version. A couple of years later, another very beautifully designed game called the 'The Shadow and the Flame' was released. Several years later, when gaming technology had reached a whole new level, Ubisoft joined Mechner and rebooted the series with game of the same name. This game was a hit and received critical acclaim.Now, the Sands of Time was followed by Warrior Within. Mind you, without Jordan Mechner in the team this time around! This second game was criticized for 1) Being too violent and containing mature material 2) Being opposite in its mood compared to the first game. I never understood this criticism except maybe the first one. The game was no longer meant for the younger audience. But the theme of the game demands it. If you want to show a man face to face with death, would you be a cheerful guy who makes jokes and sees the funny side of the story? Or would you elevate yourself to be a hard-hearted man who wants to change his destiny? Why am I typing all this? One point - this game was good in my opinion and I don't care what the critics say. Then comes the third part and this time Mechner is back. And let me tell you - he brought the cheesy romance back with him.Jordan Mechner declared about Warrior Within, 'I'm not a fan of the artistic direction, or the violence that earned it an M rating. The story, character, dialog, voice acting, and visual style were not to my taste.' Your taste? If part three is what you taste is like, it means what you like is precisely what many gamers do not like (about The Two Thrones, the third installment) - 1) Pre-programmed fight sequences 2) Cheesy romantic dialogs between male and female leads while the world is ending 3) Completely linear game flow and other issues.You can get away with enforcing your taste, maybe in the world of video games but you can't do that in a movie. You have to make the audience (and critics) believe and get involved in the story. You like a couple to have love-like-tension in the middle of the desert faced with danger, not many digest that these days. Why Jordan Mechner? Why can't you keep your taste aside for a moment and understand that you are making a movie about a Persian warrior who holds the key to saving the world in his hand? Why don't you understand that in a movie you need to convince people what is happening? What I did not like about the movie and I believe I must blame the director and the writer for it is this - the comfort a man and a woman can seek from each other when they are faced with the grave danger they are faced is definitely not the cheesy kind of love tension shown in this movie. And, a movie based on sword fighting game not having one clear shot of a sword fight. Yes, those typical shaky cam like sequences where only at the end of the fight you realize who hit whom with what. Humor is good but not when it takes away all the tension the danger is suppose to cause. In other words, the humor in this movie is weird and improperly placed.What I did like about the movie is the desert landscape and the city they 'made' in which the story is set. That is a job well done indeed. I have no problem with the cast as well. I am positive that the cast is talented indeed but of what use is the talent without the two important people who do the direction and the writing part? The story was suitably modified by Mechner for a movie but the script is not satisfying at all. Mechner should understand that the audience today has grown. If the thinks he can still fascinate an audience with a script that worked in 1989, sorry, that is not going to work today. Any seasoned movie watcher will realize that this movie had a lot of potential with the right tweaks in the direction and script.The CGI is really well done. They could have easily shown some impressive sword fighting with subtle slow motion sword shots but they choose an option which seems to be gaining increasing favor in the last couple of years i.e. the rapid shaky cam approach. But still, okay, the CGI is really well done. Kudos to the CGI team. Whoever designed the sets of the movie, kudos to you too. That too is a job well done. Costumes seemed okay. I am not in a position to comment on the cultural accuracy of the costume but for a fiction history, I don't think I am too bothered with that intricate detail (as long as Persian warriors don't wear Rolex watches). Overall, this movie is watchable. But this movie had so much in it to make it really big. I give it a 6 - an enjoyable experience with no moments to remember for a long time. Thanks.",6,1,3,31 May 2010
Spider-Man 2," Much better than Spidey 1
","The computer graphics were rectified in this installment of the series. There is a little bit of dynamism that is added to the motion of the character this time though in the end the cartoonish effect has not entirely disappeared.One of the biggest strengths of this movie is the drama element. I found the sympathy factor a little bit too much in the first part and I thought I would puke if I continue seeing the same here but I did not. I, in fact realized that it was the strength of Spider-man 2. Peter Parker cannot come to terms with the selflessness a superhero with his powers is suppose to have. He wants to set his life right. The whole struggle is shown to be really great and Tobey does it really well considering that he is not the critical actor and more of an action figure not widely known until his role as Spiderman.Doctor Ock is simply one of the most sophisticated villains and full credit to the script writers for developing him in depth. But then again, the show-down scenes, I say this, either move the character and keep the camera still, or move the camera keep the character still and yes, time and now, please show some slow motion shots of a punch or something to bring about the realism (something like Wachowskis showed the slow punch of Neo in Matrix Revolutions). Fast, fast and simply fast. It would thrill the kids but not a single shot in the movie except the one where the car crashes into the cafÃ© just before the teen scene between Mary Jane and Peter would leave a lasting impression.Another thing I found was wrong placing of humor or should I call it humor? On the train crash scene Spidey fails in his first attempt to stop the train and we have a bugging old man who goes, 'Any more bright ideas?' What is the meaning of the scene? I'd expect someone to say, 'Please do something' with an expression of 'staring at death'. They say Sam Raimi is a talented director but I doubt if this is the opinion seasoned movie-goers would share.There are fundamental flaws that Spidey 2 shows but still it remains a good movie for improvisation in the graphics, some really cool moves, a highly justified emotional struggle of Parker. I would rate it higher than Spidey 1 but still it left a lot of room for critical developments.",8,0,0,7 May 2007
Troy," Not Sincere, Unevenly Paced, Could Have Been Better!
","The name Troy reminds us of the Trojan War portrayed by Homer in his Iliad. And thus when the movie came out, I had watched it hoping to find a depiction of the same. But this movie Troy merely borrows names and characters from Homer's Iliad and otherwise is not such a sincere adaptation of the original. What is worse is that the movie does not have a proper pace and the overall handling of the plot is not to the mark.The primary reason the Trojan War took place is because the Gods wanted it to take place. Humans by themselves could never have done the deeds that led to the war. It was the madness that Gods infected their subjects with that led them to wage a war of madness on each other. This movie decides to go for an alternate treatment of the Trojan War. It removes the Gods. There are no Gods in this movie. If there are no Gods in the movie, then the act of Prince of Paris running away with Helen looks too feeble and weak. The movie fails to convince us the need of war. And when there is no need of a war, the overall enjoyment of the movie is lowered.The overall depth of the characters is poor. There is not much of character development that leads to understand their actions, their strengths and their weaknesses. Perhaps Achilles is the best done character though he is not a consistent character. Some of what he does at the end of the movie is not consistent with his overall attitude throughout the movie. The King of Troy, Priam is the only character that I could enjoy watching apart from Achilles. The movie lacks in its portrayal of characters.But there is something good in the movie after all. In spite of the overall plot being poorly handled, there is some really good action to watch out for. The two wars in the movie and the photography is wonderfully done. The scenery is wonderful. And the best part of the movie to me is the single mano-e-mano battle between Hector and Achilles. This is among the most well shot and choreographed fights I have seen in a long time. However, the reactions on the faces of the relatives of Hector who know that the end is near is too artificial and disturbing to the beauty of the fight.Overall, the movie is not enjoyable. I especially did not like the way the ending of the movie is handled. It is too lame. Today, when I get the chance I do not like to see the whole movie. I simply switch to the scenes that are well done but it is simply not possible for me to watch the whole movie again.",6,0,2,9 October 2008
Insomnia," Pacino, Williams and Nolan - a Great Team Indeed!
","This Insomnia, directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Al Pacino and Robin Willaims is a remake of an original Insomnnia movie. I have not been able to see the original movie and hence I cannot draw any comparisons between the original one and this one. But I guess that it is good in one way since I get to think about the movie without any prejudice at all. This movie is one of the most remarkable movies I have seen and indeed showcases Christopher Nolan as an upcoming director. Robin Williams and Jim Carrey are actors known for their comedy. And another common thing to them is that when they decide to step into roles other comedy, they produce masterpieces indeed. Robin Williams plays the role of an author of crime novels who has also killed a young girl. He has a dark and a negative role and plays a character who is very straightforward and calculative. And boy oh boy, does he manage to convince us in this role. It is one of the best roles of Robin Williams I have seen. I must confess his roles in Bicentennial Man and One Minute Photo and this role are in fact much better than his typical comedy roles. He has showcased some amazing acting skills in this movie. Al Pacino is of course among the finest actors in the whole world. And needless to say, he delivers all that is expected out of him. He plays the role of a cop with a dark secret of false methodology of conviction with Internal Affairs closing in on him. He ends up killing his partner accidentally but it turns out that his partner was going to help Internal Affairs close in on Pacino. And hence nobody is going to believe that he killed his partner accidentally. And to add to all the trouble, there is Robin Williams' character who knows this secret and is using it to get away. Pacino is the one who is suffering from Insomnia. He is in a country where there is no night and there is no peace in his mind. Have you wondered what it is like to carry a heavy mind craving for the peace of the night? Look at Pacino in this movie! Simply masterpiece acting.There is a short but very effective role by Hillary Swank as well and she does her part beautifully. She plays the role of a cop who is helping Pacino on the case. She also holds deep respect for Dormer (Pacino) since she has spent her training days studying his cases. Overall, the cast was really good. Christopher Nolan chose a very silent approach in this movie. In some parts of the movie, the overall silence creates the sort of haunting effect needed to create the impact. But the silence does not seem to work in certain scenes and may lead viewer to become disinterested.There are times in the movie where the pacing tends to get a little slower causing an occasional loss of interest. But overall, this movie is indeed a very well done movie. The team assembled is indeed a great team. It will not disappoint most viewers who have some expectations from a team like Nolan, Pacino and Williams.",9,0,0,8 October 2008
X-Men," Singer has a problem!
","The first superhero movie by Bryan Singer that I saw was Superman Returns and I knew at once that here was a director that had all the art to make a good artistic movie but just could not deliver too well on the action front. Superman Returns had some really neat and nice effects but the movie just moved too slow to leave a lasting impression on me. Same I found with X-Men (which I repeat I saw after I saw Superman Returns).The movie of X-Men just fails to weave all the pieces together. It is about a group of mutants divided into two sections. One led by a good man named Xavier, a psychic who believes that the powers of the mutants can be used for the good of the mankind and the other section led by Magneto, a man who believes in condemning humans. And needless to say, the movie is all about how the bad guys scheme in order to get their work done and somehow the good guys managed to prevent them. And no points for guessing - no prominent good guy dies in the end.The special effects are decent. But I always believed that there is nothing in this world that can substitute a good old close-up fight. CGI rarely manages to give you the impact that a good-old staged fight can give you. The best example is the comparison of fight between Jackie Chan's CGI based 'The Medallion' and the older movies of Chan where he does everything for real. None of the fights were truly enjoyable to me. And I also do not believe that it is the fact that the fighters are not humans that ticked me off. Because even in the Matrix trilogy, the fighters were superhuman but the movie makers managed to add some believable aspect to the movie.Maybe, just maybe, it is possible that for someone who has read the original X-Men comic books by Marvel might like the movie for it gives them a chance to see their comic book characters come alive but for someone like me who wants the story told from scratch, I do not see anything great in this movie. The cast is good but the movie is either too short for all of them or maybe too dumb, I am again not sure of that.To briefly summarize what I felt about the movie is that it fails to impress. There is no character you can sympathize with. There is no character whose profile you can construct at the end of movie simply because the movie does not spend any amount of time telling you about anyone. Anyone watching the movie can easily guess that there has to be a sequel and two more sequels have been released. How they score, I do not know but I am going to get right to seeing the second and third installments of the movies to see if Bryan has been able to do something good to them.",5,2,3,28 May 2009
Spider-Man 3," A Perfect Disappointment
","I never found Spider-man's overall handling by Sam Raimi appealing. All I know from my understanding of the spider-man cartoons and comics is that Peter Parker was suppose to be a tough guy. He had a troubled past. No parents, a dead uncle whose death was in some sense caused by he himself. And to me, it is plain obvious that such a man cannot be expected to be too weak. When life is hard on you, the end product is either a psycho or a man who is controlled and quietened. I found this kind of a focus in Parker's character as portrayed in the earliest of Spider-man literature. And what do I get here? Someone who can cry! Someone who can lose his senses so much that he allows a chick to kiss him in public knowing very well that his jealous girlfriend is watching out there. Please give me a break! And why? Why does Spidey 3 have to throw in so many characters at once? Why the Venom, New Goblin and the Sandman all in one package? Why does the story of the Sandman have to be made believe to be complex and the Venom have to be so crazy in its origin? Is there some kind of a rule which says that a movie is better if it contains maximum number of elements in it? If no, then why does Spider-man have to accommodate so many characters, have the ever-growing crap of MJ being jealous and so on? In case you are not getting my point, all I want to say is that the movie should have taken a decent plot and worked on it rather than interweaving so many sub-plots that simply cannot be inter-woven! Sam Raimi sticks to his formula of making Peter Parker look too sympathetic. MJ is made jealous! Why? So that you can sympathize with Peter? I am sorry but that just does not seem to work over here. I don't feel sorry for Peter because of MJ. I only feel like hating MJ. And then what more? You let Venom pollute the head of Spider-man so that he can actually ruffle his hair and dance in the streets winking and gesturing at the pretty ladies. What is that suppose to do? Make us feel bad for Mary Jane and say, 'No, she is not so bad - poor girl!'? What is the meaning of showing a Church and some freak praying for the death of Spider-man and immediately being sent the Venom? I wonder why the religious groups could not see something controversial about that! All in all, I would like to say that the plot of the movie is poor. You don't have to make a movie just because the previous two have been successful. In fact,the success of the sequel has to pressurize you to think hard. And sad it is for me to say this but the only thing good about this movie are graphics. I finally found something like fighting in this movie. The graphics were well done. But the plot overshadowed this.",4,0,1,8 September 2008
The Terminator," The Movie That Created The One Really Famous Line!
","The Terminator is truly an action and sci-fi classic, no doubt that. It has all the right elements in it. A good plot, a good cast, good action sequences and a wonderful director in the form of James Cameron. The story is about a machine that looks like a human being, a cyborg, who has been sent back in time in order to kill a certain lady named Sarah Conner. She has to be killed so that John Conner, who is her son, does not exist. His birth has to be prevented because John Conner is going to lead the human resistance against the machines. Needless to say, it is the machines that have sent back this machine to do the job. But the human resistance is well aware of this mission and plot. So, the human resistance sends a noble warrior to aid Sarah Conner. And no, this warrior is not a machine too. He is a human being but someone who comes from a time where he has seen enough of these machines to know how to possibly take care of one to some extent. And the chase is on. The Terminator hunts down Sarah and tries to do his job. And of course, there is someone who is going to prevent that from happening. Arnold has a perfect physique and the right face to play the role of the cyborg. It is not that easy to be expressionless like a cyborg and Arnold convinces us thoroughly that he indeed is a machine who just happens to look like a human being. Sarah's protector does a wonderful job as the human warrior that he is. Linda Hamilton, playing Sarah also brings about the right range of expressions to suit her role. All in all, the cast is fantastic. And add to this, the beautiful and clean direction of Cameron and the wonderful special effects, this movie becomes what it is - a great masterpiece. There are some people of course who find this movie a little dull compared to the second part of the movie i.e. Terminator 2 : Judgment Day. There is no doubt about the fact that T2 is indeed a wonderful movie but at the same time one must not forget that this movie comes out way before T2 and considering the time in which the movie was made, what has been showcased in this chapter of the Terminator story, is simply amazing.",10,1,2,29 September 2008
Rocky II," The fulfillment of Rocky 1
","One of the few sequels that deliver exactly what is expected from it based on the success of the predecessor. Rocky II is the continuation of the journey into the life of the boxer Rocky Balboa. It explores the impact of the fight with Apollo on the life of Rocky Balboa. Though Rocky has lost the match as per judges' decision, he still has won the hearts of thousands of boxing fans. Rocky's courage and valor have struck a chord with all boxing fans who now believe that Apollo has won the match by luck. This hurts Apollo's ego and pride and he sets out to offer one more chance to the Rock.The whole cast remains essentially the same. Bill Conti still delivers fine music he managed to deliver in the first part. The training sequence and the fight are even more intense and inspiring than the first part. The story I shall still say has been scripted very well to be consistent with the characters and story of Rocky I.However one gets to see a bit more technical side of the boxing world in this part of the Rocky series. On one hand we have Apollo who trains intensely without underestimating Rocky this time. Micky knows that Apollo was taken by surprise by the south-paw jinx (atypical boxing method that Rocky uses wherein he uses a left handed approach) but this time he will be prepared and Rocky would stand no chance. Hence Micky delivers a whole new package of training to Rocky to change his orientation and approach altogether.When Rocky's wife (Adrian) slips into a coma all training is suspended and Micky is in a dilemma. He knows Rocky needs training and at the same time realizes that Rocky cannot concentrate with his wife in coma. Here the story gets trainer-centric. So apart from acting as a window to the deeper aspect of Rocky's life this movie gives out more about the training involved and sets the story from a somewhat trainer's perspective as well.I find it very difficult to make any comparison of Rocky 2 with Rocky 1. Rocky 2 is a fulfillment of Rocky 1. One has to admit that Rocky I as a single movie would be quite abrupt.I can't find the heart to take any stars away from the movie! Enjoy!",10,1,2,3 February 2007
Forrest Gump," An Extremely Heart Touching and Inspiring Tale!
","Forrest Gump is one of those few movies that are so realistic and yet one cannot help but watch with a sense of wonder and amazement each time one sees it. It is the most heart touching movie I have ever seen that has so much to teach you and so much inspiration locked within it. Each time I see this movie, I slip into a different mood and the movie never fails to move me. The movie is about a boy with an average IQ who is taught by his mother only thing - to never let anyone tell him that he is different and cannot do anything in life. And off he goes pursuing his dreams with only a clean and pure heart and immense sincere dedication as his tools. Tom Hanks is such a wonderful and a versatile actor. He has played so many diversified roles and each of these roles, he has played with so much finesse. It is hard to imagine what the movie could have been if somebody else stepped in Tom Hanks' shoes and tried to play the role of Forrest Gump. My suspicion is that the movie would have been a tragedy had it not been for the beautiful portrayal of Forrest Gump that Tom Hanks has done. The Oscar he won for the movie is well deserved. Forrest Gump starts off wonderfully and moves at its own pace. We are gradually exposed to the simplicity and purity of its central character. He demonstrates how the qualities of the strength of heart and soul can win the game anytime over terrific brains. The movie has a lesson to teach that all it takes is focus, determination and a clean mind in order to conquer the world. And what is beautiful about the movie is that it does not show something drastic and unbelievable. It can very well be a tale that is happening right now in our own world. The movie is not all serious. It has a wonderfully portrayed and rightly timed humor content. And no matter how many times you have seen the movie, the dialogs still have their effect on you. Each time one sees the movie he or she will smile when the movie wants you to smile and will make you cry when it wants to make you cry. The most touching aspect of the movie is the very character of Forrest Gump. He is dedicated, sincere and very simple. He has no cynicism in him, no jealousy and not a single trace of any negative emotion. The movie is about his world, a world without jealousy, greed and full of purity. The music score is wonderful, so is the direction, so is the acting and so is the photography. It is indeed hard for one to find anything wrong with this movie at all. It is simply too neatly done and too beautifully handled. I cannot think of one thing in this movie that could have been done in a better way. It is a beautiful movie and deserves all the praise it has been getting. It is destined to stay in the list of best movies ever made perhaps forever. It is one of those movies that one must watch before their time.",10,1,3,9 October 2008
Predator," An All Time Great Action Movie
","Think of Arnold and only two images can flash in our minds. One image is the black dress, shotgun and black goggles image of the Terminator series and the other image is that of a Green Beret as we see in Commando and this movie. This movie, The Predator, is a wonderful action movie that showcases Arnold flexing his muscles to the full, holding the meanest of guns and firearms and hunting for something that cannot be seen but is definitely out there. The movie is my personal favorite action movie of all times.The movie is about a team of special commandos led by Dutch, played by Arnold. They head out into the forest thinking that their enemies are humans. And indeed, they find their human enemies and crush them in no time. Little do they know that out there in the forest, there is a bigger and a tougher enemy hunting them down one by one. Meet The Predator, some kind of an alien life form with a very unique set of characteristics. He cannot sense the usual 3800-7600 Angstrom wavelength of light that allows us humans to see the world but he only reads off the heat given out by living creatures. He makes up for this with an incredible array of powerful weapons and the greatest advantage of them all - camouflage! Not just any camouflage but the ability to almost disappear completely. He moves around from one tree to another patiently spotting the team members of Dutch and killing them one by one.The direction and photography of the movie is simply awesome. As we see Dutch and his team wade through the forest, it really feels like we are watching some live coverage of a mission. The scenes are really well shot and at no time do we get the feeling that this is a studio set and the guns are arms are all props. The most remarkable scene of all is when all the commandos fire all their weapons into a direction hoping to shoot down the Predator. The shower of bullets and the firing of the mini-gun is simply breath taking. And considering that the movie was shot back in 1986-7, the overall movie is simply great.The final mano-e-mano encounter between Arnold and the Predator is remarkably well done. This movie is indeed one of the greatest science fiction action movies ever done. A movie that Arnie will be remembered for. Enjoy!",9,4,5,20 September 2008
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," A Disappointing Addition to The Terminator Franchise
","When the production of Terminator 3 was announced, the first shocking news that I found was that James Cameron was no longer going to be the director. The other surprise was that the villain was going to be a female. Yes, it was going to be a female cyborg played by Kristanna Loken. With these two facts known, I was convinced that one ought not to expect anything from the third movie. And then came a ray of hope or was it? Arnold continues with his role as the Terminator. Well, I felt there was something to cheer about after all since it is not easy to imagine anybody else playing the Terminator.When the trailer came out, I saw the clips of Kristanna Loken roaming almost nude in the streets and adjusting herself to look more attractive, I feared that the Terminator 3 was going to converge with the concept of Species movies i.e. a female villain moving around seducing men and eventually killing them. But thankfully, the movie was nothing like that and that was a relief for me, a big one indeed.Finally, the movie was a disappointment for me. Firstly, we start out with a lame script. Improperly placed dialogs, really bad! Arnold says, 'She'll be back!' Arnold steps inside a lady's night club completely nude. The first goggles he wears are weird star shaped ones! What are the script writers thinking? Are they making a sequel or a parody? I could not understand! I don't know about others but I surely could not understand why the director and the writer put in what they did! And then we come to Arnold Schwargenneger. He was so convincing in the first two movies. Speaking in a way that was so robotic. That strict tone of voice that indicated near lack of emotion in the first two movies was replaced by a tone of voice that is more anger and frustration. Sometimes, one may feel that Arnold is more like a frustrated soldier who has been sent to do something much against his wishes rather than a cyborg who is programmed to do a task and is free from the very concept of emotion.For those of you who have seen the alternate ending of the Terminator 2 movie, you might realize that this ending does not allow the existence of this movie at all. But even when you choose to ignore the alternate ending of T2 where John Conner has become a senator and the Judgment Day has been prevented, you might not find the T3 as a worthy sequel.",5,0,0,4 October 2008
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," It Can't Get Bigger Than This!
","Sequels suffer from a problem. They are always made under pressure to keep up to the success of the predecessor. And also, they are scrutinized much more and often compared to the predecessor. The Terminator 2: Judgment Day not only soaks all the pressure but actually creates a movie that stands out its own as one of the best movies ever made in the history of Hollywood. The role has been reversed. The Terminator i.e. Arnold is no longer the bad guy. He is now a reprogrammed cyborg sent by the human resistance to protect John Conner as he is being stalked by a more advanced cyborg, the T-1000, played by Robert Patrick. And boy oh boy, the T-1000 is great. He can take shapes and is almost invincible. 'Almost' is the keyword here, of course. The T-1000 is light-weight and hence more athletic. None could play this role better than Robert Patrick. The perfect pleasant yet straight look in his face, his athletic body makes him the ideal T-1000. The story goes by smoothly leading from one event to another in perfect harmony. The action sequences are extremely convincing. At no point of time, one gets the feeling that there is too much exaggeration and that the movie makers have been carried away in the process of making the action scenes. The chase sequence involving the rescue of John Conner by the Terminator is among the best done scenes ever. The movie takes one step further. It showcases John Conner developing a strong relationship with the Terminator and this relation is unique in the sense that the other person cannot simply reciprocate it. And it shows Artificial Intelligence trying to reason out human emotions but with not so much success. Arnold does this bit perfectly, mimicking all the various emotions of the people he sees around and also finding the right time to use all the slang that is being taught to him by his boss i.e. John Conner. The music score adds magic to the movie. As the tension builds up in the movie, the music does everything to convince us the height of the situation. The sound effects also play their role. With a good music system, the movie easily convinces us that indeed a bullet has been shot, a bike has been started and a rod has just pierced the metal skeleton of the cyborg. The one-liner that was made famous in the previous movie does not find some cheap place here but there is a different one-liner altogether that is introduced, well timed and equally cool. The movie just fails to disappoint. A perfect 10 for this movie. It shall forever be among the best movie of all times for a very long time to come.",10,1,2,29 September 2008
Rocky IV," A very intense Rocky movie!
","Rocky 4 is a surprisingly successful addition to the Rocky series. This movie is packed with much more action, emotion and a much brutal final match. Rocky 4 is about a Russian boxer Ivan Drago who ends up killing Apollo Creed in an exhibition match. Rocky, in a flurry of emotions, challenges Ivan himself. As per the conditions of the match, he is to fight the match in Russia. He even trains in Russia considering the distractions he could face back home.We knew in Rocky 3 that in the end Rocky was going to end up on top and I am sure many of us also had the feeling that Rocky IV would also show him on top. The story is fairly simple. Just like unique training sequence, music and a different fighting method were major factors in helping Rocky 3 strike a chord with the fans of the franchise, similar was the case with Rocky IV. With not so deep a story to tell, Rocky IV needed something unique and powerful to carve a niche.And that is precisely what Rocky IV was able to find. Rocky IV found Dolph Lundgren to play the Russian boxer Ivan Drago. And it showed a beautifully intense training sequence, a shocking first match and an inspiring second match. The scene of Apollo receiving the last punch of his life from Ivan Drago was one powerful scene that created a deep impact. The fear in the mind of Rocky as portrayed in his visions while driving back home was well done too. ('There's no easy Way out' playing in the background.) Vince DiCola does a real good job with the music. The music he composed for the training sequence was really good. The training sequence itself was very good. The training shows Rocky use natural elements around him instead of sophisticated equipment (he is denied that anyway). The best part of the training scene is the huge difference between Drago's training and Rocky's training shown in parallel. It was a well done sequence.The match was really well choreographed. Intense, bloody, brutal and nail-biting. And since the movie came out at a much later stage (it had to, after all it is the fourth movie) Stallone had these well-developed abs and chest and that helped in making the match and the training look much better. The match and the training did it again for this Rocky movie. Pretty sure if they had screwed up in these parts, the movie would never have become the box office success that it has become.A must watch for all Rocky fans!",9,2,3,3 February 2007
Spider-Man," Finally out on the screen!
","When you are equipped with a resource one of the things that you need to watch out for is the proper and controlled use of the resource. Spider-man had this resource called 'computer graphics' on its side. And this was over used. Sometimes the animations appear a little cartoonish. Sometimes, it becomes a little too obvious that the character is too stationery and the background is moving way too fast. May be some of us would like it that way, blurry graphics are being liked too but they are not ideal at least.The story of the origin of powers of Spider-man is done pretty well. They slightly deviated from the original concept of the comics but the deviation was positive. But Peter Parker was a bit too over-painted with colors of sympathy. Sam Raimi is known for his skills to make his audience involve in the movie and the one trick he does seem to use here is that he actually makes the audience sympathize with the character. That has of course added to the success of the film but takes away a little bit of the heroism out. Peter Parker hardly looks strong and determined and looks a little bit too sad. I would find it cool to be Spider-man but definitely not Peter Parker.And Mary Jane's character cannot be liked. I am sure that the masses do not agree but Mary Jane is shown to be a little cruel and self-centered raising a question as to what is it about her that drives Peter mad. More than anything, it convinces me to control myself before 'falling' for anyone.The Goblin character seriously looks like he was taken out of one of those 3-d animation movies. There is very little in this character that looks like it is in flesh and blood in a world we can identify with. This is the cartoonish effect I was talking about. The Green Goblin looks cartoonish. Perhaps modification of his suit and especially his helmet might have brought a bit more realism. And yes, slow down the camera. Bring in a few close ups. Speed is not everything! Overall, the movie is filled with fun and can be enjoyed a lot. But it does suffer from over-use or rather improper use of computer-graphics. A very decent adaptation of the comic book but there was a lot of room for development.",7,0,1,7 May 2007
Dark City," Simply Marvellous!
","In the genre of the those movies that deal with issues in Metaphysics, this is among the best movies I have ever seen. Alex Proyas proves himself to be a wonderful director assembling a cast and creating a world that simply is so captivating. The Matrix and Thirteenth Floor are two other movies that deal with similar issues. While Thirteenth Floor addresses more on the question of what can be considered to be real, the Matrix is more of an all round package addressing multiple questions, this movie Dark City beautifully drives a nail in the coffin of the concept of Tabula Rasa.Tabula Rasa means a blank slate. Many philosophers have proposed that we come into this world with our minds like a Tabula Rasa i.e. a blank slate on which the world writes down impressions. These impressions then define our personalities and eventually, our soul. The movie Dark City is about a race called Strangers who are manipulating the world in order to understand the human soul. They want to find out what is it that constitutes the soul and how it works. They've created a city which they change by telekinesis every midnight. They have a human doctor who is a psychiatrist with whose help they manipulate memories of individuals and study their behavior hoping to find the human soul or consciousness.The movie straight away jumps to the central character John Murdoch played wonderfully by Rufus Sewell. He finds himself a stranger to the world around him and just as we all do, he is compelled to investigate the nature of his world. He eventually discovers the startling truth that the world he lives in is but a manufactured one controlled by the strange beings known only as the Strangers. Soon, John discovers that he has their powers and can hence ensure that the world is free of them.The movie works wonderfully. It keeps you to the edge of your seats and makes you open your ears for scouting each and every word being said. And careful you should be, for a lapse in hearing or noticing something will cause the movie to become incomprehensible. The movie can best be summed by the following dialog said by John Murdoch : 'You were searching for the human soul but (pointing to his head), you were searching in the wrong place.'",10,0,2,6 October 2008
Independence Day," A Beautiful Action Flick!
","Many people seem to have a problem with this picture. Some people do not like it because it is an action movie. Some people do not like it because it takes a well established, tried and tested plot of hostile aliens, rather than the friendly alien like ET. Some people have a problem because of the eventual method that is used by one of the lead characters of the movie in order to bring down the defense system of the aliens. But I do not find any of this too objectionable to down rate this movie as much as I have seen it has been. The story starts with alien space ships taking strategic positions across the various major cities of the world. We see an amazing effect of the city being engulfed by the shadow of the mammoth space ship hovering over it. And then, people are divided in opinions about the intention of these spaceships. Of course, it is clear from the kind of positions the ships take that the intentions are more hostile than friendly. But yet people literally throw a welcoming party for the aliens and of course pay a price for it. Some of these things have led to severe criticism from many viewers and critics. But let us put these aside for a while and see what happens next. The alien ship fires an incredibly powerful weapon that leaves the city in wreck. The sound and sight of this destruction is the strength of the movie. The movie is about war and it is war that this movie shows beautifully. And the next thing you have is an attempt by the best fighter planes trying to take the ship out. But they realize that there is a computerized shield that protects the ship. The movie follows through and finally shows the computer wizard realizing that a computer virus can disable the ship's shields for enough time so as to allow an obliteration of the ships. Again, many people have criticized this. Well, the argument goes that a civilization so advanced could not be weak enough for a virus. But there are many things we do not know about this civilization. Let us not forget that it our tendency to think in a certain way that eventually led to the creation of viruses. Did the aliens think in the same way? Mostly not! Thoughts, ideas and civilization, in general, would have advanced completely differently for them and they surely would not have even heard of a computer virus. So, I personally feel that this idea is not as bad as people are calling it. For smooth fight sequences and computer graphics, this movie is in a different league altogether. I cannot think of a better way of doing all the action sequences. Critics may argue that there are loop holes in the plot and yes, some of these loop holes are strong enough to ensure the movie does not go down in cinematic history, but I still would like to give it a ten on ten for I have found the merits overwhelmingly more striking than the demerits. A beautiful action movie indeed!",10,4,7,29 September 2008
Batman Begins," And at last a Proper Superhero Movie
","Batman is the most complex superhero I have ever come across. More complex than the Superman and Spider-man. Why? For the simple reason that he is a human being. He is not someone who has acquired super powers from some accident or has super powers because of where he comes from. He is simply a man with a troubled past, a past that leaves him with a strong desire and a will to use all the resources at his disposal to free the streets from thugs and criminals. At his disposal is money, lots of it, a skill set of martial art techniques, technology and the soundly advice of his caretaker Alfred.After a series of movies either choosing to ignore the past of the Batman and merely showing one of his adventures or failing miserably to convince the audience of the deep motivation that Batman has to define the purpose of his life, we finally have a winner in the form of Batman Begins. And not too surprisingly, it comes from a brilliant man named Christopher Nolan who has done a wonderful job with the direction and the scripting of this movie.Batman is a human being. Human beings make mistakes. Great human beings correct their mistakes. To show the limitations of Batman and yet paint him in the colors of heroism is a difficult task. This movie achieves it brilliantly. Christian Bale gets full credit for a wonderful portrayal of Bruce Wayne and Batman.The whole structure of the Gotham city is convincing. In fact, every single thing in the new world of Gotham is convincing. Nothing is overdone or exaggerated. The special effects are controlled and used judiciously. The movie moves with a steady pace giving us the depth of the characters involved and yet not making us fall asleep. Not once! Overall, this is the precise kind of Superhero movie that I have been waiting for decades. Every movie has had demerits from my stand point. I simply could not enjoy the motion picture based on He-man, spider-man was not a complete package for me and neither was Superman Returns. But Batman Begins hits the right note. Cheers to the whole team!",10,3,4,8 September 2008
Saving Private Ryan," War As It Is!
","When you see certain movies like Rambo, Commando or Predator, you see a warrior going out in the jungles and taking the whole enemy army down single handed! The truth is that while such movies are good in their own right because they allow you to escape into a world of fantasy, the movies are misleading because war is nothing like what is shown in them. You do not survive a war because you have muscles which you can flex. You do not survive a war because you are more skilled than the other. Those are the days of ancient warfare when you would fight with swords. But modern warfare is all about luck. You survive only if you are lucky that of all the thousands of bullets and debris flying around, not one strikes you or even if it does, it strikes you in a way that it does not kill you. Nobody goes into a war without fear. Nobody remembers a country when fighting a war. All that matters is survival - survival at all costs. And that is the true picture of war that Saving Private Ryan manages to show so beautifully.The movie opens with a very brutal war sequence based on the Ohama beach war. It is difficult to imagine how the movie makers managed to plan the filming of this entire sequence. It is so realistic and will forever dispel the notions of any exuberant youth who thinks that war is glamorous. There is nothing glamorous about war and there never ever will be. I have heard rumors from my friends that some people vomited in the cinema hall due the extent of violence portrayed in this movie. And so I must warn you that if you are someone who is easily affected by blood and gore, pray do not watch this movie or at least this sequence.Spielberg along with the rest of the crew does a stupendous and a beautiful job of showing a rescue mission that leads the leading group into the heart of war to rescue one man - Private Ryan who has already lost three of his brothers to the World War operations. An order has come in from top authorities to extradite the last of the four brothers. How does the team assigned feel about it? Needless to say, they are grumbling about it but as we should know, a solider is nothing but like a pawn in a game of chess the moves of which are determined by people far from any pain and without any proper understanding of how painful war is in reality.For any person, this movie is a must-watch. It is a must-watch for many reasons. You must watch it because it will remind you of what the world has seen in World War II. It will remind you that war should indeed be the last solution that a nation must resort to. It will remind you that there is no honor and glory in war. There is only one thing - miserable death. This movie will prove to be a life-changing experience for most people. It might even leave you with some sleepless nights. Yet, it remains a movie that I believe one must watch in his lifetime.",10,2,3,9 May 2009
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Well Done But Diminished Glory
","When the Jurassic Park came out it opened a whole new world for us and captured our attention. There is no doubt about the fact independent who creates the sequel, the sequel will not be able to produce the same awe the first movie gave us. But does this movie do anything new that sets it apart? Well, it does not. It simply extrapolates the idea of its predecessor, changes the locations and gives us better idea as to how insignificant we really be in front of the giant lizards made alive in the first movie. The central plot of this movie is that a team of hunters have brought back a dinosaur to the city and needless to say, as most people can guess, it is somehow free and is endangering the city. This movie sort of reminded me of the Godzilla concept wherein a monster of similar size is roaming free in the city terrorizing the people of the city. So, as such, there is nothing fresh in the plot or the story. The graphics have come of age. There is no awe left. We have already seen them in action. Since this movie comes at a later time and has better technology available to exploit, it creates dinosaurs much more realistic and even more scary and believable and that is the crowning achievement of the movie. But there is nothing more this movie has to offer. No interesting story line, no interesting twists! Just plain old plot of a monster free in the city and in the end, there is always a way of saving the city only this time it is not by killing the creature but by deporting it to its home island. There are no interesting characters or twists to watch out for but there is still plenty of action. And the action is really well done. The movie loses points for repetitive plot and lack of fresh material as far as the story is concerned but gains full points again for really well done graphics and solid action.",7,0,0,8 October 2008
X-Men: The Last Stand," All out destructive and wonderful!
","Finally, an X-Men movie without the Cerebro! Yes, this time, the director changed hands and he probably wondered to himself as to what he should do in this one. Brett Ratner definitely shows us that he can completely exploit the powers of the mutants to create an epic action movie. And boy oh boy, is Brett Ratner completely ruthless. He just does not care who dies in this one. For a change, we have a director who says that power in abundance is a power waiting to be heavily misused as history has always shown us. And this is what happens.Jean Grey returns in this installment but she is not the same anymore. She is now revealed to have dual form, the other one being Phoenix whose psychic powers can even rival those of Xavier and the worst part is that she does not have the one thing that power demands - control. And in a roll of fury, she destroys Xavier! So, Ratner destroys the most cool, composed character in the movie - Xavier. And now, when you begin to wonder that this should be something that Magneto is happy about, he is not. Ratner brings out a wonderful respect that Magneto always had for Xavier despite the bitter differences in their approach towards mutant rights and similar issues.The movie's central plot is about a certain drug that is developed using a gifted mutant. The drug is able to convert a mutant into a normal human being without all those wonderful powers. And needless to say, Magneto does not like it one bit and thus builds an army with the aim to destroy the lab where the drug is being developed and synthesized.And just like Ratner adopts a destructive path, I will in some sense destroy this movie in the comment by telling the all out destruction that Ratner does indeed cause in this movie. He ends the life of Cyclops. Mystique loses all her powers! The character who already died in X-2 dies again. And the two main masters of all mutants - both die! So, there is a hell lot of destruction in this movie. Lots of humans and mutants die! And I thought about it for sometime and realized that with so much power scattered around the world, the amount of destruction we saw in the previous two movies was quite less. So, I guess I am with Brett Ratner is his approach that if there is so much extraordinary power scattered all across the planet and the people who are possessing it are being abused, there is only one thing that is going to happen - heavy destruction.And heavy destruction is the one thing that this movie shows - an all out classic action. And the shades Ratner brings to the movie are amazing. A must-watch.",9,0,0,14 June 2009
Pi," A Totally Different Sci-Fi Movie!
","Darren Aronofsky has without a doubt created the most different and unique movie of our times. The movie is shot in a completely unique way, the direction is completely fresh and so is the story, imagery, acting and plot. This movie takes us inside the mind of a mathematician who has taken his passion for studying numbers to a point of obsession. He sees numbers and patterns everywhere and is convinced that he can find the key to everything in the universe inside numbers. The movie is about his journey from a passion to a madness that eventually starts tormenting him. Sean Gullette plays a wonderful role as a mathematician Max who is working on number theory. He has his own computer in an apartment where he lives alone. He spends the day in and day out searching for patterns in numbers especially in the stock market. He is convinced that the whole of nature follows a pattern in numbers and knowing this pattern, he can understand nature to the fullest which in short means that he can find a way to even predict the outcome of the stock market. But here is a catch. He is not a normal human being. He suffers from neurological conditions and is on heavy dose of drugs that he uses to alleviate his pain that he experiences in the head when he stresses out himself. Another very important character of the movie is Max's mentor. His name is Sol. He himself has worked on the origins and importance of 'Pi' and has faced the consequences of the madness one can experience when he becomes too obsessed with numbers. He advises Max to stop thinking about the patterns. He is of the view that once you have decided to seek a pattern, you will always find it since your mind cannot think of anything other than patterns. The movie shows debates and conflicts of interest between him and Max. What can be disappointing for most viewers in the movie is that which part of the movie is inside Max's head and which part of it is outside is something that the movie does not bother to make clear. The movie simply explores the mind of the paranoid and obsessive mathematician. But how much does the mathematician see that is in concurrence with the reality defined by others? This is the answer that the movie does not provide and nor does it offer enough clues to make intelligent guesses about it. Another drawback in the movie is that it is misleading in representation of some of its facts. But that is not too big a problem since I am sure most viewers will resort to the right sources and not the movie if they want to know about the various patterns of numbers that the characters talk about. There is some really creative imagery in the movie. At one point of time, Max sees a brain in front of him. When he tries to poke a certain part of it, he hears whistles of a train. And pressing it harder, he sees a train heading right for him clearly demonstrating how the brain plays a significant role in defining your reality. The movie is about Max's reality as his mind sees it. Truly one of the most remarkable and intelligent movies I have seen in a long time.",9,0,1,9 October 2008
The Dark Knight," An Amazing Christopher Nolan Movie!
","First of all, let me start out by saying that Christopher Nolan is a director to watch out for. With each movie he is producing and directing, he is proving himself to be a man of great intellect and the craftsmanship of a virtuoso. We saw him define the most ideal Batman in the movie Batman Begins. And now we see him define the ideal Joker in the movie The Dark Knight. In comparison to all other superheroes, Batman stands out as different and unique. So, it is not easy to handle the deeper aspects of the Batman. Nolan did this with finesse and burdened himself to live up to the expectations. And boy oh boy, has he delivered.It is completely useless to have a great director with a poor cast. A few people doing good and others doing average is a disaster in the making. A great movie has always been great because it was a moment in history where all talent was combined in a perfect manner so as to produce a perfect product. The Dark Knight is one such piece of work. Everyone in the movie has done an amazing role. A great deal of credit to Nolan and his team to manage the tight rope walk of concentrating on the evolution of all characters. Heath Ledger (rip) plays the Perfect joker. He manages to convince us that he is truly the most mysterious and the most scary villain in the history of super hero stories. His ability to manipulate his voice, the body language and dialog delivery make him believable and scary. Bale does an equally amazing job as well. His struggle to understand his duty, his responsibility and his process of learning how to handle the burden of being the dark knight that Batman is, all define this movie's greatness. The IMAX experience is worth every bit of the money. Action sequences, photography and sound effects are all well done. Batman was always suppose to be a normal human being with an abnormal past and skill set. He is not the one who was gifted like other superheroes. The whole movie keeps this in mind and makes Batman a believable character. And I guess this is what is important if you want to portray Batman correctly. What is perhaps the most touching part of the movie is the ending. Batman demonstrates that the qualities of being a superhero are more mental than physical. The Batman is ready to be hated by the people of Gotham, the very people whom he has done a favor by cleaning their streets of all the criminals who were hell bent on making their lives miserable. The ending dialog between Gordon and Batman is a highlight of the movie and not only justifies the the title of the movie but also defines the true meaning of being a superhero. All in all, The Dark Knight is the ideal sequel to Batman Begins and is an extremely well done movie. Thumbs up! Great direction, an incredible story, a solid cast, great music and overall a great package.",10,5,14,7 September 2008
Taken," A decent pop corn flick.
","The movie Taken is about a retired spy Brian played by Liam Neeson. The plot of the movie is pretty straightforward. So, if you are watching this movie to see something fresh, I am afraid that the only thing fresh that you are going to see in this movie are the faces. Yes, it is like an old story in perhaps a different location, with a different cast and a slightly different way of looking at things. Brian is a retired spy who used to protect the country from international enemies by doing certain operations and so on. The cost that he has had to pay in order to do this job is that he has not been able to spend time with his family and is estranged from his daughter. He is now retired in hopes of making up for the lost time. Time and now of course he does security provision assignments for local concerts and shows.One fine day, the daughter chooses to go to Paris and since she is a minor she needs her father's permission. Having seen the world, Daddy is all too concerned but finally lets go. And as any seasoned movie goer can guess even though he might know nothing about the plot of the movie, he can guess that something is about to happen to the daughter. And it does! No points for guessing that! She gets kidnapped conveniently letting her father listen to the voice of the kidnapper since the kidnapping happens while she talks to her father! And in then we see non-realism at its best. He guesses the kidnapper, his origin, his possible hideouts and regions of operation. He goes to Paris, he kicks ass and he tracks down the guys and gets back his daughter. Plenty of gun action. And it is pretty straight. The spies are suppose to be good with guns. But how good are they with their hands? My god! They move so fast that the cameramen cannot capture a single punch on the screen. For those who might have accidentally read my one or two other reviews, I have always been someone who complained about the camera being moved too fast to capture a punch. I hate such photography. I want to see a punch delivered, I want to feel for a moment the strength of the hero as he lands a punch on his opponent. This movie denied me that.The action flows smoothly in the movie. The direction is about okay. The movie is never realistic. A major complaint I have about the movie is that I do not feel any love between the father and the daughter. Of course they are supposed to be estranged but still overall on the emotional front, there is nothing much that the movie delivers. It is a pure action movie and it portrays action at the cost of everything else - including realism and emotion. The only emotion that finds strength is the brutal anger of the hero as he unleashes hell on the streets of Paris.Overall, a mindless flick worth watching if an escape from reality is what you are looking for!",6,0,0,20 May 2009
Saw," A Truly Remarkable Movie!
","Movies based on serial killers come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. But common to most of these movies is one central theme. The central character loves killing. He is a sadist and he is on the prowl. He defines his life by the amount of suffering he can impose on his victims. Many movies have been made on such ideas. What has perhaps differed from one movie to another is the method of killing. But in the end, the movies had a typical end - some way somebody manages to put a stop to all this. Some movie makers tried showing more blood and gore to attract the audience and some tried to show death in compromising situations which would attract the attention of the perverted. And after a significant amount of these movies came out a wonderful movie in form of Saw. The Saw movie is not like other movies at all. It is no doubt about a serial killer but this time the difference to the movie is not just the method of killing but also the motivation for doing so. The movie does not dwell too much on the past and development of the killer. That would be so typical, right? On one end, you show the current activity and parallel to this, show his past. No! This movie is not like that as well. It just shows his activities of the past but not his past. And then we come to know that this guy is completely different. He is not killing for pleasure and sadism like others, he is doing it as some kind of a perhaps misguided noble work. All his victims in the past have been drug addicts or people whom he thinks have no value for their own life.The movie takes you straight to the action. It has one of strangest beginnings I have ever seen and an end that is simply beyond imagination. And this makes the movie unique and special. The blood and gore wherever present is just right enough to produce the ideal effect on the minds of the viewer. The plot is good and the screenplay is very tight. The music is intense. The movie does not give you breathing time. It progresses rapidly and involves you completely. And should I say more about this movie, I would completely spoil the fun for you. Please avoid reading or knowing the story in advance else you will destroy all the fun for yourself. Cheers.",10,1,3,21 September 2008
Rocky," Beautiful, inspiring, awesome!
","The first installment in the Rocky series was the beginning of the inspiring era of Rocky movies. A low budget movie about a low rated boxer who gets one shot chance to prove what he is made of. You name the aspect of a movie and Rocky has done a wonderful job. Script, acting, music...almost everything.Bill Conti has done an amazing job with the music. The music has become symbolic of inspiration and iron will. So much so that I see so many people exercising and gym-goers working out with the Rocky theme in the background. Gonna Fly Now played during the training sessions of Rocky is one favorite track of mine.About Stallone. Stallone has proved himself as a good actor and a great script writer. For those who do not know, the script was written in a matter of three days after Stallone got inspired by a boxing match. Three days is too fast for an amazing movie like this one. Stallone plays the role of Rocky wonderfully and it is extremely difficult a task for me to imagine absolutely anyone else who could have stepped in his shoes and done a better job.The rest of the cast also does a wonderful job. Burgess Meredith, the cold yet caring trainer, Talia Shire, the immensely shy girlfriend of Rocky, Apollo Creed, the loud mouthed, slightly over-confident champion, everyone has done a decent job.The boxing match was one amazing sequence. The brutality of the match and the punishment both inflict on each other and no matter how much Apollo tries Rocky keeps coming back up. So much so that Apollo occasionally gives a frustrated look of disbelief. That was one encouraging fight.And of course, let us not forget the training session. As such the training sequence's major part is the music again. For a person with sufficient heart, this movie can be a life changer giving one tremendous inspiration and strength. After all, one of the purposes of the medium of movies is not only to entertain or educate but also inspire. This movie does just that.Rocky Rocky Rocky!!!",10,2,4,2 February 2007
The Da Vinci Code," A Decent Flick!
","When a movie is made from a novel, there is always an uncertainty involved as to how it will be received by the audience and the critics. Some of the movies like The Godfather have been successful in creating master pieces by drawing inspiration from master pieces. But there is always a problem with movies derived from popular novels. There is something missing in the novels that movies can provide. It is pictures! There are no pictures in novels as a result of which you tend to form your own images of the places and the characters when you read through a novel. Now, should a movie be made based on the novel, you tend to have some amount of prejudice in the sense that you are searching for the precise same images you had created for yourself when you read the novel. Many a times, movies flop simply because the director's vision of the story and the happenings does not seem to match or resonate with the opinions of most readers. I believe that the Da Vinci Code can be placed in this category.The Da Vinci Code was a novel written by Dan Brown. Dan Brown, of course, cannot be considered an incredible author but he had done a decent job with it. Of course, the plot can be questioned in many ways but the way the novel as such had become very popular most people had heard about it and many had read it. And the starting note had made the novel even more popular. The statement made by the author that all the descriptions of the customs, rituals and artwork are real caused many people to be convinced by the conclusions drawn by the characters are true and the popularity of novel spread far and wide.Dan Brown definitely did not build the characters in extreme detail. For example, when Al Pacino had read The Godfather, he knew what he was suppose to do when he'd play Michael Corleone. But my personal opinion about the character of Robert Langdon is that different people will visualize him differently when reading the novel and hence many might not like the role of Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon. Add to this the incredible reputation of Tom Hanks for having portrayed extremely complex characters before and you get a collection of negative comments on Tom Hanks' role. I think Tom Hanks has done a decent job with the role. It might not be a Forrest Gump or a Castaway kind of a role but nonetheless it was a decent act.There are two ways of looking at this movie. One is with prejudice formed based on your version of novel. And other is that of a viewer who has not read the novel at all. Those of you who have read the novel and disliked, you really should not be bothered about the movie at all. Those you who read the novel might not like it unless you are able to reset your mind and see the movie from an independent perspective. And those of you who have not read the novel, there is a good chance that you might enjoy it.The Da Vinci code does not deserve any exceptional place in the history of movies as a critically acclaimed movie. But it still remains a well done movie. The screenplay is fast paced and the characters are quite good. Tom Hanks is a good Robert Langdon, so are all other actors good in their own places. Sometimes the movie can get monotonic with the chase sequences but overall, it is a decent movie. Ron Howard's work as a director may not be his best but is overall decent.This movie is worth watching for both people who have read the novel and who have not read the novel. For those of you have read the novel, my sincere advice would be to try and look at the movie unbiased and unprejudiced. Kudos!",8,1,2,20 September 2008
Rocky III," Come on, hit me harder! Ain't so bad! Ain't so Bad!
","Rocky 1 and Rocky 2 together were a nice coherent story. So when I heard of Rocky 3 I seriously did not know what precisely to expect. What would be the story line? What aspect of Rocky's life was to be explored now? Rocky 3 portrays a possible problem a boxer might face after his career reaches the peak. As Micky puts it, the boxer gets 'civlized'. Rocky has achieved all fame and name and not to mention a lot of money. He has changed his lifestyle completely much to the disapproval and dismay of his wife and trainer cum friend Micky. His training becomes less intense and over-confidence takes over him after a streak of wins. He does remain the kind hearted and humble man that we have seen him as. This change in Rocky's life and perspective is a possible reference to Apollo's life as well. Apollo too was shown to be over-confident and over-relaxed in the first part of Rocky series.In the meantime, we see emerging, another vicious, brutal boxer Clubber Lang. Clubber Lang clearly has one advantage on his side. His training is mean and vicious. And he is rising up...fast! So when Clubber Lang and Rocky are scheduled to meet in the ring we see the difference in the training styles of both boxers. One can clearly feel the tinge that Rocky is going to lose and he does. With Micky suffering a heart stroke, Rocky under-prepared and over-confident gets a beating from Lang and loses in the second round by KO. With Micky dead and Rocky's confidence and pride totally shattered, Apollo now offers to help Rocky train once again for a rematch. Apollo however teaches Rocky to be faster and more agile. Now make a careful comparison between Stallone's fighting method as Rocky in the first two movies. He did not move fast but gave intense punches and almost had a street brawl. This is of course the reason why the decision goes in favor of Apollo in the first part for Apollo had been able to land way more punches and jabs on Rocky. And now see the way he fights in the third installment against Lang. He moves faster, has a very good footwork, excellent dodging capability and has more stamina. I have to appreciate Stallone for having trained hard to show this new ability of Rocky's. The movie does get a little off the track when we see the fight between Hogan (as Thunderlips) and Rocky. The training scenes are very good but still there is something absent that was present in the first two movies. It is difficult to describe what exactly seems to be missing. The movie tries to tell that one should not let success get into their heads. It also shows an emerging friendship based on mutual admiration and respect between Apollo and Rocky.And I believe that a write-up on Rocky 3 is incomplete without Rocky 3's soundtrack 'Eye of the Tiger' by Survivor. Was possibly a song with the best lyrics to suit a boxing movie. The soundtrack covers up a lot for the very slightly reduced luster of the Rocky saga.In the end, I'll say it is a well done movie and not bad at all! It is a highly entertaining, warm and an encouraging movie.",7,2,2,3 February 2007
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Could Not Be Better Than This! Simply Delightful! Must Watch For All Ages!
","The amount of time that I can get on my hands to read books is very less and hence it was always my last choice to read a Harry Potter book considering that it is meant for the children. No amount of hype about the Harry Potter book could ever drive me to read the book. I always would resort to alternate reading. And then one fine day, I saw this computer game of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I enjoyed playing it and it was through the game I came to know the story of Harry Potter. I felt that it was so brilliantly done. I began to wonder whether it was the creativity of the game designers that created this world or was it the sheer genius of the author to make us imagine such a world. I decided to find out and finally read the book. And it was then I realized that Rowling had indeed created a whole new world for us and so fresh it was.Finally came the movie for me. I decided that I wanted to see the movie. And I was delighted watching this movie. The whole new world this movie exposes to is so filled with delight and cheer. The child cast is amazing. Each one convinces us that he or she fits the shoes of the character they are playing. At no point of time, one gets the feeling that 'Oh, this is not how Rowling described it!' The movie and all the characters have been created with wonderful precision staying as faithful as possible to original descriptions penned down in the book. The computer animations and special effects are simply amazing. It is hard to imagine that so much of CGI is involved in the movie. It is so wonderfully done that one might wonder if such a world does exist and all the movie makers had to do was to use the camera to capture it. The movie makers have spared no effort in creating the world of Harry Potter. Every single scene is so well thought out. This movie deserves all the praise it has got. The book and the movie is no doubt targeted at the children but I am sure that even the adults are going to love this movie. Somewhere deep inside all of us there is a child who wants magic with whose aid we may forget the perils of the world in which we live and escape into a dream of fantasies. This movie provides us just that. The world in this movie is so alive, so cheerful and so delightful. This is one of most amazing and fresh movies in years. A must watch for all movie goers independent of whether you have read the book or not. Truly amazing!",10,0,1,9 October 2008
The Wrestler," A Good Movie But IMDb ratings have gone crazy!
","Let me start out my comment on The Wrestler by saying that it is a very good movie and is one of the best movies in recent times. I am going to devote a certain amount of my time trying to tell you on what I think about the IMDb rating system which might convey a message to the people that I have a negative opinion about this movie, so let me make it clear right in the beginning itself. I like this movie and I think it is a great movie with some really good directing, acting and scripting.This movie is about a wrestler and his life. The movie draws a wonderful comparative analysis between the life of a wrestler and the life of a strip dancer. I have always wondered about what precisely was the difference between a strip dancer or a prostitute and the wrestlers. Both, at the end of the day, are drawing money for a living by doing something with their bodies. This movie resonated with me in the sense that it shows that parallel really well. Towards the end of the day, there remains no difference between the two, both are using their bodies, though in different ways in order earn their living. But then again, the comparison is only a small component of the movie.The movie centers around the life of 'The Ram', a professional wrestler, his life and his passion for wrestling. The movie is a reelistic movie. At no point, do we see something that is exaggerated or something. And of course the movie is an eye opener for some of the people who still think that Professional Wrestling is a real deal and it is also an eye opener for the other extreme bunch of people who think that wrestlers are complete fake. There is an intermediate view that one needs to understand about this industry. The results and the events are scripted, no doubt about that but the pain and the punishment are real. You are live in front of a thousand plus audience and there is no way that you can fake blood oozing out of your body due to a pack of nails stuck in it in front of them. They are trained to bear that pain and they bear it to earn their living.I must tell you though that there is nothing this movie does which makes it stand apart as one of the greatest films in the history of cinema. So, how does this movie come out in the Top 250 of the IMDb list. The answer is simple. The formula used by the IMDb to calculate the eventual rating does indeed depend on the number of votes that movie has got. And so you shall see that the user base has expanded in recent times and that user base has given full energy in voting for the newer movies and thus you will find the newer movies finding top spots at the cost of older movies who people might not have seen at all. Simply said, there is nothing great about the movie The Wrestler in my opinion which gives it to be in league of the great movies of all times. That is an inherent problem with the public vote and rating system employed here.Coming back to the movie, the direction is great. It shows the life of wrestling entertainment professionals quite well. The overall scripting has a quality of being identifiable with. No poetic dialog and no clean script. The language is that of a commoner and hence makes it great. The lead actor Mickey does a wonderful job with his role. He is a very likable character. Overall, this movie is a must-watch and even a bigger must-watch for the fans of professional wrestling.",9,1,2,6 May 2009
The Silence of the Lambs," The Most Brilliant Psychological Thriller
","The Silence of the Lambs is the only Horror genre movie to win the Best Picture Oscar. Both its male and female lead have won the Oscars for their performances. Sir Anthony Hopkins holds the record for the shortest on-screen role to get the Lead Oscar award. He hardly spends 16-18 minutes on screen and produces magic. These factoids and the well deserved high rating on IMDb was what drove me to watch this movie. And at no point of time, I felt that the movie enjoyed more praise that it deserved. It is a brilliantly done movie that deserves all the cheers and applause. Jodie Foster is one my favorite actresses of all times. Her work in Contact, Flightplan, Anna and the King and other movies was praise worthy. And her role in Silence of the Lambs is perhaps her best role ever. She plays an FBI trainee who has been sent by the FBI to try and talk to Dr. Hannibal Lecter and seek his help in finding a serial killer. Dr. Hannibal Lecter is a serial killer himself, a brilliant psychiatrist with extremely intellectual insight into the human mind. Agent Starling is scared of her interaction with this madman Lecter. And you are scared of him because she is scared too. One of the very few actors who can show fear so beautifully on her face. She faces situations everyday in her life where is ends up being the only female in a room full of men. This no doubt is a source of discomfort for her and you can see it all over her face. Dr. Hannibal Lecter is not an average serial killer. He is a brilliant psychiatrist. His understanding of the human mind and his skill to dissect your thoughts by observing your facial expressions and listening to your voice is demonstrated early on in the movie. He is willing to help Agent Starling catch the serial killer but in return wants to diagnose her for he in her past he sees a tragic set of events that have contributed and are still contributing to her life. The game is on! Lecter gives his insights to Starling in exchange for her honest and candid information about her childhood. Every tiny aspect of this interaction is handled so wonderfully. The director Jonathan Demme does not fail in any aspect. He builds the perfect package. The eventual track down of the serial killer, the suspense and the overall story is so well done. At no point of time does he resort in showing something that makes the movie conventional or unrealistic. The movie grips you with fear and keeps you at the edge of your seat till the very end of it. The movie is not about the serial killer and his mind but it is more about Agent Starling and her peculiar relationship with Dr. Lecter. But that still does not allow Demme to ignore his development and portrayal. The serial killer is believable and complex in his own right.This movie is a classic. It is destined to be in the list of great movies for a very long time to come. And I am sure that should any actor try to step in the shoes of either of these characters, he or she would be taking a very big risk indeed. The characters are so strong that it is hard to imagine any other Agent Starling other than Foster and any other Dr. Hannibal than Sir Anthony Hopkins. (I'd recommend you see The Manhunter to see another actor try playing Dr. Hannibal and see for yourself.)A must watch for all movie fans! Cheers!",10,3,5,5 October 2008
X2: X-Men United," Brian Singer's Corrections! Well Done!
","I was not at all happy with the slowness and dullness of the first installment of the X-Men. And I had compared it with Superman Returns and concluded that perhaps slow was how Singer did his work. At least, to me. I had argued that one does not need to make a story too strong if he can give some breathtaking sequences that leave us spell-bound which too were quite absent in the first installment. It is almost as if Brian Singer was aware of these and decided to correct them in the second installment.As far as the story is concerned, there is still no significant change. The story has not much of a higher dimension but I never felt the absence of this since the action was just too well done in the movie. There are some really amazing and breathtaking sequences throughout the movie. The action unfolds very smoothly and the places and action are so believable in the sense that there is no cartoon-like touch to it. A very strong job done by the CGI people.The movie is filled with newer kinds of X-Men with better and unique abilities setting the stage for some fantastic battles. And the best part is that we have some shades in the characters now that make us identify with them. The character of Wolverine is better developed and makes us wonder about him. Xavier wins our respect with his silent and spiritual way of looking at the world. Surprise! The presence of mutual respect between Magneto and Xavier also wins us over! It is just too well exhibited. Overall, there are shades of emotions in the character that make them involving.Overall, this movie is a much better package than its predecessor which was quite devoid of proper emotions, character stress and development and for that matter - stunning action. This movie takes the standards way ahead and is just a good package.",9,1,2,9 June 2009
The Matrix," The Perfect Symbiosis of Action and Philosophy
","What is real? How do you define real? This question has been explored for its significance in metaphysics in other movies as well. The Thirteenth Floor is one of them and the other is Dark City. I mention these because they were released more or less around the same time as this movie was released. But these two movies do not enjoy the position and the popularity of this movie - The Matrix, why? Look at the box office success of the Matrix. Look at the popularity of this movie. Advertisements have been created based on the themes of this movie. Most people seem to have heard of the movie if not seen it. The Matrix enjoys a prominent position in the top 50 on the IMDb. Even a list of 100 best movies of all times as compiled by a documentary on the Discovery Channel mentioned this movie as among the top 100. The key to the enormous success of the Matrix is the symbiotic combination of two opposing elements. The first one being metaphysics or philosophy and the second element being intense amount of action. The Dark City is limited in its action and stresses more on the metaphysics aspect and so does the Thirteenth floor. When you see The Matrix, you see that there is far more metaphysics and philosophy in this movie when compared to the other two. And when you see the action sequences of the movie, the two movies fade into oblivion. There is so much for the intellectual to busy himself with in this movie. There is a reference to so many mythological places and figures. The character Neo is an anagram of One signifying the One Absolute many cultures believe in and then there is Trinity, an obvious reference to the Holy Trinity. The names of the ships, the numbers on the door, the name of the book Neo takes his CD out from all have a significance, a clue, if that is what one wants to call it. This movie gives enough to the intellectual to study and talk about. And yet the movie does not fail to capture the attention of the average movie goer. The average movie goer does not want to search for hidden symbols, he does not want to discuss the movie for hours and hours. He wants some action and some fun. The movie gives that as well. The movie has a lot of guns, a lot of chases and a lot of fighting. The average movie goer can appreciate the main aspect of this movie without bothering about all the hidden symbols which the intellectual chooses to see in the movie. Yet, he apparently does not deny himself the spirit of the movie and enjoys it. And I believe this is what has made the movie successful - the reconciliation between action and thrill and metaphysics and philosophy. This movie deserves all the praise and success that it has got. My personal all-time favorite. I never get tired of talking about it till date and love to see it with my friends if I get the chance.",10,29,53,29 September 2008
The Pursuit of Happyness," Superb!
","This is a very heart warming movie based on the life of Chris Gardner starring Will Smith. Will Smith has perhaps done the most challenging role of his career and he has done it with finesse and the Oscar nomination is well-deserved. Full credit to Will Smith for a job well done and to the entire team as well including the child actor.I guess I need not describe the story for it should be well-known. Briefly put, it is about a man named Chris Gardner and his battle to fight the crisis in his life to come up on the top. It is the story of his struggle to set his life right.And here is a small address to some of the critics who believe the movie sends out the wrong message. What wrong message? That pursuit of pecuniary independence is the pursuit of happiness? This is utter nonsense. The movie in fact encourages one to fight no matter what and find the happiness they are looking for. And yes, about the importance of money, we all know it is important in the structure of the society that we have created for ourselves. My strong opinion is that it is only the most pessimistic of persons who can ignore all the strong messages in the movie and argue (not discuss) about this 'message' issue.A must watch for all Smith fans and the 'real-life inspired drama' genre of movies.",10,1,1,30 April 2007
Jurassic Park," Revolutionary CGI Effects...Simply Breathtaking Movie!
","Michael Crichton, in his novel, tells us how it is possible for us to have dinosaurs walking along side us in today's time. Steven Spielberg ambitiously takes it on himself to showcase the idea of dinosaurs walking and running along with us. And my God, what a wonderful job he does! Jurassic Park is simply an amazing movie that makes us drop our jaws and look in amazement and bewilderment at the dinosaurs as they walk on the silver screen. No encyclopedia and no book can be as effective as this movie is when it comes to showing what dinosaurs were and how grand they were when they ruled the earth.The photography in the movie is outstanding. There is a scene at the beginning of the movie where we get to see the helicopter land on the heliport near a waterfall. The very beauty of the nature puts a smile on your face. And to make this shot even more wonderful, there is a wonderful music score that further broadens the smile. It puts you in a different mood altogether. And it does not fail to reproduce the magic even when you are seeing it again and again. Till today, whenever I see this one scene, it still puts a smile on my face.Finally, when you get to that part of the movie where the dinosaurs are seen for the first time, your jaws drop. You look at them in sheer amazement. You are almost convinced that somehow dinosaurs continue to exist and all the filmmakers did was to capture them on their cameras! No, not true. Dinosaurs do not exist and the ones we see in this movie are computer animations. Any man who does not have any idea about how effective computer animation can be, they are surely going to believe that these mammoth creatures exist. There is much realism in them.Prior to Jurassic Park, you always have had movies which were based on the concept of man vs beast. Once the movie has revealed the dinosaurs to us, the movie essentially becomes a struggle of survival. The dinosaurs are no longer secured and humans are in danger. I did not have any problem in this typicality of the plot. Because, it is not always necessary to create new plots. You can try and improvise on existing ones and show them in a more creative and different way. The Jurassic Park does that. So, I would not call it a weakness in the movie since it handles the overall plot beautifully.If there is one complaint I would have for the movie, it is with regard to the villainous computer nerd who tries to sell off the embryos for cold cash. This part of the movie is a little loose and could have been handled in a better way. Also, the man who gets locked up in the toilet and the hunter getting outsmarted by the dinosaur are some things in the movie that are lame especially in comparison to how the overall plot has been so beautifully handled. But I still cannot take anything away from the movie. Sometimes negatives can be ignored if the positives are overwhelmingly strong. And the positives of the movie are way too strong for these things to be taken too seriously.The movie is meant to be exciting and exciting it no doubt is. Steven Spielberg does a wonderful job with the Jurassic Park and this movie is surely destined to be a significant part of cinema history. It will be remembered for its special effects which were so excellently done. Though produced in early 90s, this movie can still be used as a benchmark to evaluate the standing of even the newer movies. This movie gets a 10/10 from me. Highly recommended for both watching and adding as a part of personal collection.",10,1,2,8 October 2008
The Godfather," It is a movie 'you can't refuse'!
","Imagine a room full of seasoned movie goers and critics. The topic of discussion - what movies are the best ever? And the name that unanimously pops up as a strong contender for the top spot - The Godfather. With an incredible star cast, an incredible director (Francis Ford Coppola) and a strong story (Mario Puzo) this movie surely deserves all the praise that it can get.The Godfather is a three hour movie based on the life of the Italian American Mafioso based on the original novel written by Mario Puzo, who also has written the screenplay along with Coppola for the movie as well. It stars legendary and highly respected actors namely Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, etc.What makes Al Pacino's role particularly tough is the evolution and the development of his character. He starts out as a person who does not want to do anything with the family business and as circumstances change he gradually changes the direction of his life and evolves throughout the movie. And Pacino does it splendidly. Surely his acting skills are not overrated as some might feel.The story is a depiction of bitter reality, a bitter reality that was already put forward in the novel and made more accessible and imaginable in the movie. Perhaps this also explains why some haters of the movie exist. It does not offer the escape from reality many other movies seem to offer and let us face it - it is not a simple, straight story to understand. Though 3 hours in length, many viewers could watch it over and over again and each time a viewer watches it he might understand it in greater depth.The direction is near flawless. This is one huge reason why this movie is always critically on the top spot. Incredible research has been done by Copolla and Puzo in depicting the Mafia world. How does a Don think? How does he protect himself by organizing layers and layers within his empire that render him untouchable by the law? How insecure does he feel? What does he consider when he plans a move? How careful does he have to be in every step that he takes? How does he exploit the whole system around him in order to be the one controlling all the strings (please note the puppeteer's strings in the logo of the movie The Godfather)? These are some of the questions both the movie and the novel try and answer.For those of you who have read the novel, I am pretty sure most of you will not be disappointed. It is the best example of how best can a movie be made out of a splendid novel! And for those who saw this movie and liked it, I'd suggest that you read the novel as well for it shall explain in even greater depth the subtle details of the working machinery of the Mafia empire. And yes, please see The Godfather 2 as well.And may I also add in the end that the second part 'Godfather 2' is a fulfillment of the first. A must watch for every person who has watched part one.I am sure that this movie is going to retain the honour of its top spot and critical finesse for many years to come.",10,3,6,1 February 2007
