Requiem for a Dream," Definitely a True to Life Movie
","When this movie came out it did not look appealing to me. I didn't think I would like it because when it came out I was a junkie, just as bad, if not worse, as the couple that were the main characters. The movies that I had seen about drug addiction in the past weren't real. The were always glamourized. I am now a recovering addict and saw this movie about a year ago (after I went into recovery). It had an impact. It was like looking at my life from an outside perspective. I was seeing what I looked like and had gone through. The acting in it was superb. They really made you believe that that was their lives. The directing was phenomenal as well. The angles, the camera work, the real emotion that you could tell went into this movie were unbelievable. Not many people see or understand how dark of a world drug addiction can be unless the person has been there but this movie shows the truth of that harsh reality. I believe this movie helped me and maybe can even help someone else in that dark world or even help someone avoid that world.",Null,10,20,13 December 2004
