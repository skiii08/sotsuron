Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Long, Long, Loooong Time Ago, This Movie Started....
","I don't want to go on and on about Phantom, as that has been done ably by many before me; I'll just stick to making a few simple remarks here. The first thought that comes to mind when I think of TPM is 'now, what was that one about?' This is one of the most 'substance-free' films I have ever had the misfortune of seeing; it just sort of starts with a bunch of fighting, then they talk awhile, then it ends with some shooting or fighting or something. One of the most engaging aspects of the Star Wars saga is its colorful and varied characters, the renegade Han, the idealistic but naive Luke, and so forth. This alone made up for the sometimes erratic performances in the 'old' installments. Unfortunately, Phantom's plot is non-existent (if you find it, please get back to me), and its characters are generally miserable, unlikeable little chunks of cardboard propped up with sticks. I finished viewing 'Phantom' with a feeling that most everyone on-screen could just have been killed off and it'd all be the same. Sadly, the only victims are dull Jedi Qui-Gon and poor Maul, who was the only one worth saving...The action and SFX are hollow and lifeless, seemingly slopped on there to cover up for the lack of any other good qualities. Lucas and his bunch are going just through the motions in this lackluster entry.All in all, a drab, boring film and a weak effort on Lucas' part.",1,4,8,6 September 2005
