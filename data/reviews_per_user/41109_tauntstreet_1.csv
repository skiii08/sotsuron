3:10 to Yuma," There should've been role reversals
","Christian Bale might have been a far better villain than that of Russell Crowe. Bale is still the 'up and coming' actor, or not exactly the household name such as Crowe, which would lead to a more convincing character here. Yet, this is the finest I've seen Crowe; whereas typically, I haven't any tolerance for what he's done to date ('A Beautiful Mind' was dreadful, and I'd sooner have a listen to aural wallpaper than take in 'Cinderella Man'). Bale is always good, and to think he's from my country! What I wouldn't give to take on such a consistent Yank accent. In fact, the both of them sounded genuinely American throughout. Certainly worth seeing. When there's only the first season of 'Benson' to purchase, also look into the original of this film.",7,1,2,11 September 2007
