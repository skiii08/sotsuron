Requiem for a Dream," A powerful but overwrought drama that would have been better for more subtlety and less camera tricks.
","'Requiem' is one of the most overrated movies here on IMDB. To be sure it is an intense, often gripping and very well acted film. Ellyn Burstyn was unlucky not to get best actress for her harrowing role. However the film is badly directed: there are far too many camera tricks used and it feels like an exhibition of 'things I film school'. If it was just when the characters are tripping out on drugs, then the distorted camera views and use of fast-forward, slo-mo and fast editing of images would be effective. But when such things are overused, as they are here, they distance the viewer from the reality that the movie is trying to portray. They come across as showy rather than brilliant and break your suspension of disbelief.Another thing that is rather hard to swallow is the casting of the young drug addicts: they are just a bit too good looking. Jennifer Connelly in particular is so angelically beautiful it is hard to imagine her as a drug user. She is a talented actress but, as in 'A Beautiful Mind' I think they should have cast someone who looked a little more average, who showed more of the wear and tear of life on her face. The movie also thinks that it is smarter than it is - but it lacks the wit or gritty realism of 'Trainspotting' and basically all it has to say is that drugs are bad. It does do a powerful job of showing just how badly they can screw up your life, but really anyone with a brain knows that already.
'Requiem for a Dream' is very good, but it seems a little simplistic and loud when compared to truly great (and, significantly, non-American) films like 'Once Were Warriors' or 'Trainspotting' that also deal with drugs and domestic hells.7/10",7,0,1,8 September 2002
Minority Report," Does not live up to its potential to be a great movie, but still very good.
","'Minority Report' should have been one of the year's best movies. It is directed by Steven Spielberg who, despite his gooey moments, is a great director. It stars Tom Cruise, who, regardless of what you think of him as a person, is a charismatic and talented actor (if you doubt me, go and see 'Magnolia'). It is based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, the warped and brilliant mind responsible for the ideas behind 'Total Recall' and 'Blade Runner'. And the photography and special effects are superb.
It is the year 2054 and murder has been wiped out in Washington D.C., due to the Department of Pre-Crime, which uses the psychic powers of three pre-cognitives (Agatha, Dashiell and Arthur, presumably named after the famous mystery writers Agatha Christie, Dashiell Hammett and Arthur Conan Doyle, which is a nice touch) to prevent slayings before they happen. Cruise plays the leader of the Pre-Crime unit, a skilled cop who lost his son 6 years earlier and now uses drugs to try and dull the grief. One day he is monitoring the visions the pre-cogs have when he sees himself commit murder and is forced to go on the run from his own unit. As he tries to discover who set him up, he realises that what he needs is in the mind of Agatha, who may have had a conflicting vision of the murder.The first half of the movie is excellent, with several tense and exhilarating action scenes and a some creepy moments, particularly involving a genetically-engineered garden and eyeballs. What is most impressive though is the technology of Spielberg's future world. Like most good science fiction movies, the technology seems both amazing and believable. I particularly liked the transparent viewing screens which Cruise could manipulate with cybernetic gloves, the chamber of cryogenically frozen criminals and the spiderlike, retina-scanning robots. The cast is solid, with a quietly haunting performance by Samantha Morton as Agatha.
However in the second half the movie goes a bit flat, becoming too like a routine murder-mystery. I was not moved by the way the relationship between Cruise and his son was shown and the villain did not impress me. Besides the obvious mind-bending paradoxes about changing the future, there are also number of questions that the movie asked but did not answer. Why are there no ethical storms about the way the pre-cogs are used? If the surgeon hated Cruise, why wasn't he less helpful? Shouldn't clothing fashions be different after 50 years? What exactly happened to Cruise's son? They are not large things, but together they add up. 'Minority Report' is very good, but it does not become the great movie it promises to be.

Blade II," Not a smart movie, but a stylish and gorily entertaining one.
","'Blade 2' is an action movie crossed with a horror. It is macho, gruesome and very, very violent.That description will have put many of you off completely, which is fair enough, but if you do have a taste for the action genre then you should see this movie, because it kicks ass.For those of you who have not seen the first film, vampire hunter Blade (Wesley Snipes) is half-human, half-vampire, with their  strengths but not their weaknesses - except for a thirst for blood. He's a bit like Buffy, but a lot nastier. In the first film the vampires took his mentor Whistler (Kris Kristoffersen) and Blade is seeking him. Blade finds the old man but also learns that there is a new breed of vampire loose in the world, almost unkillable mutants called Reapers, who feed on vampires as well as humans. Blade must team up with a elite unit of vampires to try and destroy the Reapers, while watching his own back and developing feelings for one of his enemies.The movie is actually an improvement on the original. We get a closer look at the vampires, particularly one family, and, ironically, they become more human, which makes them more interesting than when they are just sadistic killers. But the real foundation of the film, the thing that all action movies stand or fall on, is the intensity and style of the action. It is here that Blade 2 triumphs. The fights are adrenalin-surging amalgams of power and precision, speed and slow-motion, beauty and brutality. Guns, swords, fangs, kicks, throws, punches, dark glasses, black leather, tatoos (including a Maori design), vampires disintegrating in showers of sparks and gore. Because it is so spectacular, and occurs largely to the undead or faceless guards, the violence does not have the unpleasant, dehumanising feeling that many more realistic action movies do. With its superhuman warriors the film belongs to the tradition of martial-arts fantasies developed in Hong Kong and is exemplified by 'The Matrix' and 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'. While it does not have the class or intelligence of those modern classics, Blade 2, with its merging of Gothic shadows and cyberpunk technology, is very stylish. I could not say it was smart, and it certainly is gratuitous, but it is, literally, bloody cool.

Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Wonderful to look at but spoilt by awful dialogue and a dull romance.
","The original Star Wars trilogy has become the stuff of modern myth, likeJames Bond, or The Lord of the Rings. People obsess about it, there aremasses of merchandising spinoffs and loath it or love it, Luke, Darth and company are a part of pop culture. There were hints that the series was losing its lustre in 'Return of the Jedi', but even so the shallow and often irritating 'Phantom Menace' came as a big disappointment to most older viewers. So here we are again, another highly-anticipated installment, another guaranteed blockbuster. Is it any better than its predecessor?Well, yes. It's good. But it could have been a lot better.
There's a lot to like here: the visual imagination on display is asbreathtaking as ever, for example in the design of Camino, the rain-drenched world of graceful but vaguely sinister clone-making aliens, or in the beasts of the arena on Geonosis. The energy and scale of the action scenes are also impressive, with nearly-seamless CGI effects. A shame there isn't the same flair in the writing. He may think up a decent plot - and I do like how he portrays a democracy turning into a dictatorship -  but when it comes to dialogue George Lucas is simply bad.The script in the first half-hour is awful, full of lines that feel likethey've been cut from a cardboard box. While it does get better -  there's a good scene in a bar early on - every now and then we get another clanging line. The romance between Padme and Anakin suffers most from corniness. Natalie Portman and Hayden Christiansen look the part: she's gorgious, he's handsome, with a darkness under his eyes that suggests anger and arrogance. But otherwise their affair has the originality and charm of a bad Mills and Boon. They tumble in the long grass, they angst in front of a log fire, they say things like 'I am haunted by the memory of that kiss that should not have happened. Do not let that kiss become a scar.' I actually groaned aloud several times.In the original films the actors generally rose above scripts that weren't all that much better than this one, delivering lines with panache and creating memorable characters. But here, Christopher Lee aside, they can't. Perhaps it's because they were acting in front of blue screens most of the time, but when actors as good as Ewan McGregor and Samuel L. Jackson seem flat, you have to point the blame at the director for not making them feel at ease, or giving them more to work with. Lucas says he doesn't listen to critics and does things his way. He needs to face facts, step back into the background and provide concepts and an overall vision, leaving the writing and direction to people with more talent. You can almost imagine him in hismulti-million dollar ranch, being seduced by his own Dark Side. 'Come with me George, include Jar-Jar Binks again. The kiddies all loved him. Together we will rule the box office. Oh, and let's call it 'Attack of the Clones'. That's a cool title.' Like the Force, nearly every good thing about this movie is matched by a bad one: some lively CGI characters, some wooden actors. Christopher Lee and his mesmerising voice, Jar-Jar and his teeth-grindingly irritating one. The stunning images, the banal script. Just when you think the movie is beginning to soar, along comes a cliche (the assassin killed just before she can name her employer, the woman who dies with a last gasp 'I love you') that jars your suspension of disbelief. It picks up steam in the last hour but there is only one great scene: when Yoda puts aside his stick and picks up his light-saber. For New Zealanders the other highlight will be seeing Temuera Morrison and some other Polynesian faces on screen. Tem is solid as bounty hunter Jango Fett, and he gets some cool action scenes, but he's seems a bit too heroic and likeable for the role and like the rest of the actors he has to mouth some pretty rank lines.What is hilarious is hearing the clone soldiers and little Boba Fett speak with Maori accents. Too much bro, too much.For all its flaws 'Attack of the Clones' is enjoyable, if you're a Star Wars fan like me. But if you need to see something that makes you feel more than awed, excited and occassionally amused, something with original ideas and characters with depth, don't bother turning up.6 1/2 /10",6,0,0,20 June 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," Yet another witty and wonderfully animated movie from Pixar.
","'Monsters Inc.' is one of the computer-animated successors to the brilliant 'Toy Story'. It lives up to the tradition of brilliant animated films both kids and adults can enjoy. It's even better than 'Shrek', and 'Shrek' was pretty damn good!The story follows Sully (voiced by John Goodman), a giant, furry monster, and his friend Mike Wazowski(Billy Crystal), a green eyeball with limbs. They're from 'Monstropolis', a city of monsters in another dimension and their job is to collect 'scream energy' by, you guessed it, coming out of closets (which, as we know from 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', are interdimensional portals) and making kids scream. However, there's trouble at work (kids are getting too hard to scare, rivalry with another monster) and everything really starts falling to pieces when a little toddler comes through a door into Monstropolis. Monsters are terrified of kids, whom they regard as toxic. Which is reasonable enough.The animation is gorgious, it's very funny (on different levels), fast-paced and not too sentimental either. Definitely one of the most enjoyable movies you'll ever see. Watch the end credits too: like a Jackie Chan film they're one of the highlights of the movie.8/10",8,0,1,7 April 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," It has a few flaws, but is still the finest fantasy film of all time.
","It lives up to the hype. It's magnificent - the best fantasy film I've ever seen. O.K, so it is not as great as the book. Even in three hours, set against the gorgious New Zealand landscape and featuring some lavish sets and costumes, it cannot hope to match the richness of detail and historical depth that Tolkien could fit into the 500 or so pages of The Fellowship of The Ring. Nor does it have the pacing of the book - without slashing more parts of the story director Peter Jackson simply couldn't spare the time to make the transitions between the major events as smooth as Tolkien did. At times we seem to jump from one big scene to another in 'Greatest Hits' style;  for example, the shift from Moria to Lorien is too sudden. Having said that, the screenplay by Jackson and his collaborators is an excellent adaption of the book, retaining almost all of the best scenes and lines - 'many who live deserve death, and some who are dead deserve life. Can you give it to them? Do not be so quick to deal out judgement.' - while keeping the plot tight and even improving on Tolkien (blasphemy! the fanatics cry) in some ways, such as by showing more of Saruman's rise to power, adding the big badass orc Lurtz and bringing out several laugh-out-loud moments, particularly with Merry and Pippin, which the book lacked. Jackson's best achievement though is how the film looks. As with 'Harry Potter', my imagination generally topped what was on the screen - but to the filmaker's credit there were plenty of things that were even better than I had envisioned. I cannot emphasize this too much - 'Fellowship' looks AMAZING. Seething hordes of goblins, an idyllic, waterfall-bordered Rivendell, hellish labyrinths of mines and tunnels, thrilling, chaotic battles, and the Balrog. Oh my God, the Balrog. I spent a lot of this movie with my jaw unhinged. In terms of the acting, the casting is just about perfect. Sir Ian McKellern as Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, Sean Bean as Boromir and Sir Ian Holm as Bilbo are outstanding, and pretty much everyone else hits the mark. To act in this kind of high-flown mythic style and not be melodramatic is tough, but they pull it off - with the exception of a few moments. Yes, it's not perfect. A few shots of Arwen and Galadriel - all angelic and glowing - are overdone, some of the lines are delivered sentimentally, and the music, which generally excellent, also goes over the top at times. And, reluctant as I would be to do it, if I was editing the film I'd cut out the whole Lorien chapter. It's pretty good but compared to the rest of the film it doesn't add much, has a couple of those creaky moments I mentioned, lengthens a long film and does upset the pace. Again, Jackson couldn't afford the time to give the forest enough of the feel of a wondrous, magical sanctuary that Lorien had in the book.  Rating: 8 1/2",8,0,0,4 April 2002
Apocalypse Now," A staggering piece of filmaking in all aspects.
","In 1902 Joseph Conrad wrote a story based on his own experiences called 'Heart of Darkness', which is about a steamboat captain travelling up the Congo. The captain witnesses the appalling effects of Belgian imperialism on the Africans as he slowly moves deeper and deeper into the jungle, where he will meet Kurtz, a formerly brilliant Belgian agent who has gone mad. It is a story of civilisation and savagery, and it is one of the great works of English literature.In 1979 Francis Ford Coppola released 'Apocalypse Now', a movie based on Conrad's tale but about a different form of colonisation. Set during the Vietnam War, it is the story of Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) who travels upriver with a boat of mostly young soldiers on an assignment to 'terminate the command' of Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a formerly brilliant special forces officer who has gone rogue. For all their hardware, for all their awesome technologies of death, the Americans are losing the war because they simply will not go as far, will not give as much as the Viet Cong. Nor can they win over the Vietnamese people, because they do not really care about them. They are tools, a means of stopping Communism from spreading to somewhere really important, and they are treated as such. Kurtz has decided to change this: he is leading a cult who will do anything to win. Anything.The version that I have seen is a new, longer cut called 'Apocalypse Now Redux'. I have not seen the original so I cannot say if it is an improvement, but what can say is that Redux is a masterpiece. It is the best war movie I have seen: it shows modern battle in both its awful glory and its muddy, bloody wretchedness. The sun sets, golden behind dark trees, the jungle explodes in flames, choppers whir in and out of earshot, bullets zip out of the foliage, men and women lose their minds and lives. It shows, in a series of lurid scenes, what the war, the jungle and the heat have brought out in the men: their brutality, their casual race and sexism, the crumbling of their humanity. Though it seems pompous to say so - a silly feeling, as like all art movies can be more than just entertainment - this is a profound film. However it could have been better. I could have done without the manic and rather irritating photojournalist played by Dennis Hopper: what he tells us about Kurtz could have been shown to us directly, or been spoken by the man himself. There is also a sequence set on a French plantation that was added by Coppola. The soldiers have a break from the war, bury a dead comrade, over dinner there is a discussion about the war in a wider context, and Willard has a romantic encounter with a lonely French woman. In itself it these are good scenes, but they breaks up the momentum of the movie. As the soldiers have been going deeper into the heart of darkness, facing horrors that have gotten more and more intense, this relatively peaceful episode dissipates some of the tension that has built up. It also lengthens what is already a very long movie.That aside, in the blackness of a movie theatre, with the screen taking up my whole field of vision, the sound of The Doors' eerie 'This Is The End' filling my ears, from the beginning of the movie to the end I was riveted to my seat. There is a famous scene where choppers come out of the blue horizon, Wagner's 'Ride Of The Valkyries' thundering from their speakers, and rain death apon a village where the terrified Vietnamese scurry like insects. It is terrible and beautiful, grotesque and exhilarating. It is like reading Revelations. It may be what the Apocalypse feels like.9 1/2 / 10",9,0,0,2 September 2002
Spider-Man," The Green Goblin's silly costume hurts an otherwise very good film
","Spiderman has all the ingredients of the best comic-book superhero movies: a likeable leading man, a beautiful love interest, strong sexual tension, a villain played by a top-notch actor, cool special effects. What lets it down is an odd thing for such a big-budget movie: a silly costume. The movie is strongest in its opening half, when the characters are being introduced and Peter is learning his new powers. One of the best scenes in the movies is when Peter stares in delight at the new muscles he's grown overnight and flexes them in the mirror. Every skinny man's dream. Tobey Maguire is an excellent Spiderman: he has a wide-eyed sense of wonder and innocence about him that helps us feel both his pleasures and pains. There is also genuine chemistry between him and Kirstin Dunst, something which feels all the more real after the horrible attempt at romance in 'Attack of the Clones'. There are some corny lines and sometimes when Spiderman is web-slinging his way across New York it does feel like you're watching someone else playing Playstation, but overall director Sam Raimi has done a fine job. But back to that costume. It's not Spiderman's that is the problem, indeed reliable sources tell me that Maguire looks quite sexy in his skin-tight suit.Rather it is the Green Goblin, who looks like a cross between a carnival clown and a cheesy, plastic-armoured 'Star Trek' extra. Willem Dafoe is convincing as both loving father and vicious killer, but as soon as he puts on his mask he becomes just another raving maniac in a ridiculous outfit. Because of this it is hard to get involved in the fights between the hero and the villain, the centrepiece of any superhero movie, which is why I would rank this below such films as 'X-Men', 'Superman' and Tim Burton's brilliant 'Batman' movies. That aside, Spiderman is a good film, and its huge success in the States will produce several sequels. I look forward to seeing Maguire and Dunst in them. 6 1/2 / 10",6,0,0,18 June 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Formulaic and nothing deep, but well-acted and very entertaining.
","You could point out how ridiculously complex the robbery is. You could wonder why Tess dated the casino owner in the first place. You could even analyze the underlying sexism in the story, but by doing so you're really missing the point: 'Ocean's Eleven' is not supposed to be deep or meaningful - it's just very fine entertainment.Danny Ocean (George Clooney), master con-artist and thief, has just been given parole after a few years in prison for the one crime he got caught for. So naturally the first thing he does is get in touch with old partner Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), now teaching stupid Hollywood teen stars how to play poker, and they assemble a crew (his 'Eleven') for a stunningly audacious heist - he's going to break into the vault that holds the cash for three of Las Vegas's biggest casinos during a world heavyweight title fight. Ocean also plans to steal his ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts) off Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), the owner of the casinos.It's a heist movie, and as such there are a few basic elements - experienced pros, talented youth (Matt Damon), beautiful love interest, evil villain, super-secure safe. Yes, it's predictable in its basic plot, but the real pleasure in the movie comes from watching the ingenious robbery unfold, twists, turns, problems and all, and the considerable charm of the stellar cast. The deadpan Pitt and Clooney  and the snakelike Andy Garcia are particularly good, and there are some excellent lines:Clooney: 'What happened to Billy X?' Pitt: 'Dead.' C: 'He got shot?' P: 'No, skin cancer.' C: 'You send flowers to the funeral?' P: 'Dated his wife for a while.'There's not much substance in the film, but there sure is a lot of style.RATING: 7/10Tane",7,0,1,5 March 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Epic, spectacular and thrilling, but also flawed.
","In my review of 'The Chamber of Secrets' I mentioned how tough the job of Chris Columbus, director of the Harry Potter movies was. However when it comes to adapting books to film his job looks straightforward compared to Peter Jackson's. Over a thousand pages of novel had to be trimmed and shaped into six hours of film, perhaps two dozen important characters to bring to life, millions of devoted Tolkien fans and also the general filmgoing public to satisfy. I thought he did an amazing job with 'The Fellowship of the Ring', which was, aside from a few overwrought moments, probably as good an adaption as could possibly have been made. Unfortunately I can not say the same for 'The Two Towers'.Oh, it is very good - Jackson again shows what a master he is at staging battle scenes and creating moments of wonder and horror, the special effects and New Zealand scenery are breathtaking and the quality cast again do a good job. But there are moments that are a bit corny and scenes that could have been more tense and exciting than they were.The story consists of three seperate plot lines - Merry and Pippin journey into Fangorn Forest where they meet the Ents, the ancient Shepherds of the Trees, Frodo and Sam head closer to Mordor with Gollum, the twisted former possessor of the One Ring, and the remaining members of the Fellowship fight to save the kingdom of Rohan from the forces of Saruman, who has used magic and a treacherous advisor to enfeeble Theoden, Rohan's king.While it is packed with characters and events, there is not as much in 'The Two Towers' as there was in 'Fellowship', so while it does not have quite the variety of locations events that the first film did, Jackson has been able to create a film that is not as episodic this time (which was inevitable with the theatrical version of 'Fellowship' - see the extended DVD version for a longer, better-paced cut). The three-pronged story is still which was the screenwriters and editors biggest problem, as they had to try and juggle and balance the plots so that the viewer follows what is going on while the movie's momentum is maintained. Generally I think Jackson and company did a fine job but, especially towards the end of the movie, they could have done a better one. The film cuts between the climaxes of all three plots which reduces the power of each of them, especially the epic battle of Helm's Deep. The battle is a huge, superbly choreographed sequence but the tension that it creates gets released too often as we shift to what Sam and Frodo or Merry and Pippin are doing. I think it would have been better to finish Sam and Frodo's story, except for the epilogue with Gollum, which belongs at the end, before cutting between the battle at Helm's Deep and the hobbits' dealings with the Ents.Partly to provide a climax, a lot has been changed from the book. Many things that were in 'The Two Towers' will now be in the third movie (which makes me wonder how they will fit everything into 'The Return of the King') and a few things have been added. Some of the additions, such as the battle with the warg-riders and the Black Rider's sweep over the Dead Marshes, are very good. Others, such as Aragorn's near-death experience and his triumphant return, the slow-motion fall of Haldir and the reunion of a mother with her children are cliched. The screenplay is a flawed one: it does not always explain what is going on adequately and there are a disappointing number of melodramatic moments. I could have done with less shots of frightened women and children, less inspirational speeches, less beams of shining light and, though he was funny, less of Gimli the dwarf as comic relief. Sometimes, as at Helm's Deep, the atmosphere should be grim and frightening and a joke spoils the mood. As do a few cute, anachronistic moments such as when Legolas skates down stairs on a shield or when Sam talks about what it would be like to be a character in a great story. 'The Lord of the Rings' is not supposed to be postmodern - such moments just take you out of the alternative world that the movie is trying to create by reminding you that it is a movie.But while it is not up to the very high standard of 'Fellowship', 'The Two Towers' is still a quality movie: spectacular, sometimes stirring and gorgious to look at and listen to. There is one other thing that would make it worth seeing: Gollum. The first CGI character to actually act well, Gollum, with his split personality, creepy voice and pale, veiny, superbly rendered body, is fascinating to watch. All his scenes are among the movie's best. If 'The Two Towers' does get an Oscar nomination for acting Andy Serkis, who did the voice and the movements that Gollum was based on, will probably be the one. I suspect though that this won't be the year that Peter Jackson gets to go up for Best Director or Best Film. Oh well, there's still 'The Return of the King.'7 1/2 / 10",7,1,1,8 January 2003
Men in Black II," Fun but lacking in new ideas.
","I'm going to start this review with a weird analogy. Bear with me.Films and their sequels are like meals. You can can cook them a different way, maybe add some new spices, and it might even be an improvement on the first dish (say, 'Batman Returns' versus 'Batman'). But if you just reheat the original - well, you've all microwaved leftovers. That's what happens to 'Men In Black 2' - it's the same story, tasty enough but not as good as when it was fresh out of the oven.Perhaps because we've been here before the film feels flat until Jones appears. His weary, weathered face adds a bit of depth to the fun and he and Smith do the old funny-black-guy paired with straight-white-guy routine well. There are some nice touches in the film, such as the alien civilization kept in a locker or the Playstation control pad in the rocket-car, and the various tentacled, feathered, scaled and wormlike aliens are cool. But some things are done poorly too - for instance Smith's love interest is weak, the much more interesting woman from the first film is dismissed in one line and the climax lacks something new.If you really liked the first MIB, or you are in the mood for some light sci-fi/comedy and aren't feeling too critical, you should enjoy this. But don't expect to be thinking about it a few days later.6/10",Null,0,0,17 July 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Faithful and attractive adaption that lacks real spark.
","If ever there was proof of that cliche 'it's never as good as your imagination', this movie is it. It looks wonderful, has some great scenes and the casting is very good, but it does not match the charm, atmosphere and cleverness of the book. Ironically, you may very well enjoy it more if you've never read J.K Rowling's world famous novel, as I and some others who've seen it found it hard to get into the film, as we were watching it with half an eye for how accurately it fitted our visions rather than enjoying it purely for itself. The film's lacks can be summed up by a paradox: it is both too true and not true enough to the book. The film is a bit disjointed, with the changes between scenes not being as smooth as they could be, and I think this is because it is trying to follow the plot of the book as exactly as it could. The problem is that books and films are two different media, and what works in one will not necessarily work in the other. The film does not (and probably cannot, as the books do not have a narrator that the film could use) have the hidden voice of the author to fill in the gaps in the plot and add those little satirical touches that helped make the book so enjoyable for adults as well as children. This means that there are parts of the film that do not have the punch they do in the novel: for example the early scenes dealing with Harry's appalling foster parents are good, but they do not quite convey the wretchedness of Harry's 'normal' life as they do in the book, and despite Alan Rickman's disdainful drawl, Professor Snape is not as nasty as I imagined him. As a result there is not the tension surrounding whether Harry will get kicked out of the school and why it's so important that Snape's house Slytherin doesn't win the trophy. Perhaps this explains why parts of the film seem rather flat.The other significant problem I had with the film was that Daniel Radcliffe, who plays Harry Potter, does not have the energy and fun that the character does in the novel. He's not bad, and he does look very like I imagined Harry Potter to, but he seems a bit passive. Other than that the acting was pretty spot on - Robbie Coltrane is particularly good as Hagrid and the actors playing the teachers and the other kids all do an excellent job.The film's strengths are many and far outweigh it's weaknesses: some things are even better than I saw them in my head: Hogwarts looks magnificent in it's Gothic wierdness, the invisibility cloak is indeed very cool, the chess match is brutally satisfying and, most impressively, the Quidditch match is a triumph: full of hurtling broomsticks, violent collisions and flying bodies. It's like a cross between rugby and basketball in mid-air, and it rocks. The story is obviously a very good one and, while it isn't as scary as the book, it's good and dark for a movie aimed at kids as well as adults. I enjoyed it, and might enjoy it more on a second viewing, when it doesn't have the baggage of living up to a modern classic. RATING 7/10.",7,0,1,4 April 2002
A Beautiful Mind," Some moments of Hollywood sentimentality make this a very good, but not great film.
","'A Beautiful Mind' is one of those inspirational films about a troubled man struggling against the odds and winning. The kind that do well at the Oscars, like 'Gandhi' or 'Forrest Gump'. Russell Crowe plays John Nash, a brilliant mathematician who developes schizophrenia and loses touch with reality. He deals with his illness with the help of his wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly). Fashionable cynicism aside, it is a wonderful story, because it's true. Of course some of the nastier things Nash did when he was nuts - like slag Jews - are ignored for the sake of a tighter script and a more appealing hero. This is an example of why the movie is good but not great - director Ron Howard ('Apollo 13', Richie in 'Happy Days') can't quite trust the story. He has to overplay his hand, showing Alicia's nobility and Nash's courage a little heavy-handedly, letting the music soar a bit too much, in short making a Hollywood movie. It's not that 'A Beautiful Mind' is sickening or earnest - there's a surprising amount of laugh-out-loud moments relating to Nash's delusions and some gripping scenes - but there is enough schlock to keep it from being really outstanding.  The performance that sums up how overrated the movie is belongs to Jennifer Connelly. She was widely praised by critics and picked up Best Supporting Actress at the Baftas and Oscars, but frankly she's too beautiful for her role. There are no lines of care on her face, not enough weariness or pain. It's pretty hard to see why she falls for a self-centered, socially inept nerd like Nash. Connelly tries hard, but gives us an angel when we need a real woman.  It is Crowe on whom the movie stands. As a man he may be little more than another Aussie yobbo, but on screen he's a class act. Look around a campus, particularly the Science blocks, and you'll see his young Nash: twitchy, not quite meeting the eye, a little hunched, very smart, the social skills of a hermit crab. Later, in Nash's prime, he becomes more aloof, arrogant, contemptuous of 'lesser mortals'. then the schizophrenia sets in, the nervousness returns and his eyes become sunken and desperate. I can't imagine a more different role than Maximus in 'Gladiator', which shows that Crowe has one hell of a range as an actor. Some may find his performance mannered, but as he spends most of the movie portraying a man on the edge of sanity it works, and works terrifically well.  In the end we are left with a fine film: 'A Beautiful Mind' is well directed with a good script, a solid supporting cast and a great lead actor. But best film? Give me the grandeur of 'The Fellowship of the Ring', the cleverness of 'Memento' or the charm of 'Amelie' any day.  7 1/2 /10",7,0,1,7 April 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Entertaining and sometimes exhilarating film that is slightly superior to its predecessor but still pales when compared to the book..
","Christopher Columbus, the director of the first two Harry Potter movies, has had a heavy burden to bear. He had to recreate on the screen what millions of adults and children imagined when they read J.K Rowling's books, he had to bring the characters and world alive for those who had never read the novels, balance out being exciting enough for the adults with not being too scary for the kids and endure the inevitable, unflattering comparisons with not just the books but Peter Jackson's superb Fellowship of the Ring'. Overall he's done a decent job  the first movie was a good though straight and occasionally flat reproduction of The Philosopher's Stone' and The Chamber of Secrets' is an improvement on that, if not a major one. If you haven't seen or read The Philosopher's Stone' then don't bother watching this, as it will be very hard to follow what is going on. For those of you who have and want a summary of the plot, Harry again escapes from the Dursleys, his horrible non-magical relatives, and returns to Hogwarts, despite receiving a warning from a house-elf called Dobby that his life will be in danger. And indeed when he gets back there he not only has to worry about his enemies Professor Snape and Draco Malfoy, and the narcissistic new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Gilderoy Lockhart, he also discovers that there is something monstrous stalking the corridors of Hogwarts, something that only he can hear.  Like the book, the movie The Chamber of Secrets' is darker than it's predecessor and will be too scary for many young children. This makes it more intense and enjoyable for most of us adults, though there are a couple of moments in the climax where Columbus shies away from fully showing some graphic violence, which reduces the power of the scene. It is a difficult balance that he has to maintain and while he does a great job in an earlier scene with giant spiders, he can't quite pull it off for Rowling's pretty gory finale. Unfortunately again the movie is not as thrilling or satisfying as the book, as Columbus still does not seem to have the pacing and atmosphere quite right for every scene in the film. Some, like those with the Dursleys and the Weasleys at the start, do not seem long enough to fully bring across the flavour of the book. At other times what is happening is not properly explained, which would be confusing for those who have not read the book - parts of the climactic battle especially seem merely convenient rather than miraculous -  while in the middle the movie gets a bit slow. Parts of this are not Columbus' or the screenwriters' fault  the movie is a long one already and getting across the richness of detail a book has in just a few hours is always difficult. Unlike in the first movie they did feel confident enough to make some sensible changes to the sacred text, such as adding to the book's action scenes and cutting out some minor details, but I do feel things could have been done better, perhaps by dwelling on some things a little more, cutting out some minor plotlines, and adding to the atmosphere of some scenes by using bit more music and some more imaginative camerawork.  However I should not get too negative, as this is an enjoyable and exciting movie. The special effects and sets are marvellous and one of the ways in which it is an improvement on The Philosopher's Stone' is because of Daniel Radcliffe's performance as Harry. He still does not completely capture what I imagined the young wizard to be like, but he is livelier and more charismatic than he was in the first movie. The rest of the cast are very good, and there are two delicious performances from Kenneth Branagh as Lockhart and Jason Isaacs as the arrogant Lucius Malfoy. Seeing Richard Harris's final appearance is quite poignant too, as there is a quaver in his voice that suggests he was not a well man. Finding a replacement for him will not be easy. 7/10",7,0,0,17 December 2002
Ice Age," Funny and well made, but not one of the best animated movies.
","I love cartoons. They can show things that films with 'real' actors and scenery cannot - though computer effects are changing that more and more. They can push the boundaries of satire ('The Simpsons'), good taste ('South Park'), spectacle ('Aladdin'), or reality  ('Toy Story'). There are some good examples of this in 'Ice Age', such as when we see a motley herd of now-extinct mammals migrating across countryside, chatting like old friends. Such scenes are a pleasure to watch, as we get the feeling of both the familiar and the strange at the same time, usually in a way that makes us laugh. While Ice Age is not as good as the top animated movies of all time, it's a really fun film. Sit back, enjoy the deliberate anachronisms, the lovely backgrounds and the belly-laughs.The story follows Manfred the grumpy mammoth, Sid, an idiotic sloth, and Diego, a sabretooth tiger, as they take a human baby back to his tribe - for very different reasons. On the way, naturally, they have a whole lot of problems. Also popping up throughout the journey is Scrat, history's unluckiest rodent, who is desperately trying to bury an acorn for the winter: in glaciers, on top of dead trees, in ice-caves. His opening scene is a classic.It's a simple story with a very predictable end and a middle that is just a series of funny incidents with some character-building moments thrown in, but some of the scenes, such as the nappy-changing or the dodos, are hilarious, the animals are likeable and it looks good. There is one quite touching moment too, when cave paintings of mammoths come to life in front of Manfred's eyes.Not a must-see, but good for a fun hour or so.7/10",7,0,0,18 June 2002
Amélie," A charming and beautifully shot modern fairytale.
","Simply delightful.'Amelie' is the highest grossing French film of all time, and it's been nominated for many awards: this is not surprising, as it's almost irrestitably charming. The story follows the title character, Amelie Poulain (Audrey Tautou), who had a childhood so miserable that Blubber, her goldfish, attemped to commit suicide. No, it's not depressing: instead it's rather quirkily funny. The story is narrated in an offhand way, which makes the almost surreal things that happen all the more amusing. If I can be so boring as to throw in a literature reference, I think the writer must have been a fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's 'One Thousand Years of Solitude' - the style, a mixture of nostalgia, fantasy, melancholy, romance and comedy, is similar.Amelie grows up to be a shy, odd young woman but her life changes one day when, in a typical contrast of tragedy and happiness, she hears the news that Princess Di has died, accidently dislodges a panel in her flat and discovers hidden behind it an old box of mementos from a child in the 1950s. She decides to track down the owner and, if he is happy to see the mementos of his childhood, devote herself to improving the lives of those she knows and likes. He is, and she does - but in bizarre and secret ways. Amelie is, as her friend 'The Glass Man' says, 'fond of strategems'. For example when she was 6 she got revenge on a cruel neighbour by climbing up on his roof during a World Cup soccer game and disconnecting his aerial every time France look like they're going to score. She gets more subtle with age.The movie is about more than this though, as Amelie falls in love with Nino, another weird loner. She doesn't the courage to approach him, so she goes through the most convoluted process of getting his attention and meeting him. Her messing about is both frustrating and very funny.The movie relies heavily on the elfin Tautou, who is one of those women (such as say, Kate Winslet) who are very sexy because their beauty is unconventional. She, and the rest of the film, are wonderful  to watch - the camerawork is superb and most scenes are shot with a slightly golden filter that heightens the fairytale atmosphere. And because it's in French, the most lyrical of languages, and has excellent music, it's a pleasure to listen to as well.If you don't come out of it feeling better about life, stir a little less cynicism into your morning coffee.RATING: 9/10Tane",9,0,1,5 March 2002
Gangs of New York," Vivid, powerful and marked by Day-Lewis's magnificent performance, it does not quite live up to its promise.
","Few movies begin as well as Gangs of New York' does. Priest' Vallon (Liam Neeson), watched by his young son, girds himself for battle, gathering about him a barbaric, rag-tag band of Irish immigrants as he walks through fire-lit tunnels and chaotic halls, then out into the still whiteness of an 1846 winter's day in New York's Five Points district. Out in the square he is met by his rival William Bill the Butcher' Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis), who heads the Nativists, an American-born Protestant gang. Then, with all the ceremony of Homeric battles, the gangs go to war.Sixteen years later Vallon's son, now calling himself Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio) returns to Five Points where he seeks to re-establish himself. As an awesome aerial shot makes clear, Five Points is the grimy, crime-riddled heart of New York, which Amsterdam describes as less of a city than a furnace, or a furnace in which a city might one day be forged.'  Here he meets the lovely Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz), a thief and a con-artist, and is taken under the wing of the man he has come to kill, Bill the Butcher himself.When he meets Amsterdam the Butcher introduces himself as New York' and indeed his character towers over both Five Points and the movie. Orator, crimelord, father-figure, racist, patriot, sadist, warrior, showman, Day-Lewis rolls them up into one unforgettable moustached tyrant. It is a magnificent performance. Next to it, DiCaprio's Amsterdam is inevitably a bit pale, but he still does well. Do not imagine that this is a replay of Titanic's charming pretty-boy  Amsterdam is, like the movie itself, angry, violent, conflicted and charismatic. Diaz is unconvincing but the rest of the cast bring to life the vivid assortment of crooks, whores, corrupt policemen and underhanded politicians who fill the movie.Like all serious dramas dominated by larger-than-life characters like these, Gangs of New York' is often in danger of getting overblown and sometimes becomes so. Though it is packed with great scenes, like when three different men pray to the same god, each claiming his power for their own, or a long tracking shot showing Irish immigrants arriving in the harbour, becoming citizens, being signed up to fight the Civil War and boarding a ship that is unloading coffins, Gangs' does begin to drag after a gripping scene at the anniversary party of the 1846 battle. A long film, it does end strongly though not with the power it promised to have. So it is not one of director Martin Scorscese's greatest films but it is still outstanding, a dirty, gory, intense and beautifully realised epic. It does also have some depth: like many of his other films, such as Mean Streets', Taxi Driver' or Goodfellas', Gangs of New York' shows Scorscese's loving and loathing vision of his home and how in that city, as in the rest of the nation, blood, crime and hatred were, are and will remain an integral part of America. In the times we live in it is a theme worth thinking about.8/10",8,0,0,4 March 2003
Donnie Darko," A dark and quirky black comedy that is a pleasure to watch.
","Adolescence is a tough time for a lot of people. For Donnie Darko it's more than tough. Donnie is a perceptive and highly intelligent young man, but he is also moody and troubled to the point of having to go to therapy and take drugs to control his anger. He comes from a good, if conventional home and goes to a good, if conventional school, but he just does not fit it. Donnie's problems are a part of his personality and in the course of the movie we see how he tries to deal with them. Just how big those problems are becomes clear when, just before a jet engine mysteriously smashes into his room, he has a vision of Frank, a demonic rabbit who tells him that the world is going to end at the end of the month. And things just get weirder from there.Donnie Darko' does not fit neatly into any genre of film. I would describe it as a combination of black comedy and teen drama. Fans of The X-Files' will enjoy the dark, surreal mood of much of the movie and though it will definitely not appeal to everyone, I found it both funny and moving. Jake Gyllenhaal does an excellent job of playing Donnie, a role that requires him to be likeable, charismatic, pathetic and frightening, sometimes all at once. His romance with Gretchen Ross (Jena Malone), a new girl at school with problems of her own, is one of the highlights of the movie, as are the scenes with Patrick Swayze's terrifying motivational speaker and Beth Grant's evangelical gym teacher. But the most memorable part of the movie, and the one you will most want to talk to people about, is the ending. It is hard to discuss it without giving away what happens, so I will just say that it makes sense, in an ambiguous kind of way, but I still found it a bit unsatisfying. Nevertheless, Donnie Darko' is an excellent film and just the thing to get out if you want to watch something offbeat that will make you both laugh and shudder.8/10",8,0,0,1 September 2002
