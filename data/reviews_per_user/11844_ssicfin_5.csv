Skyfall," a major disappointment after dark knight rises
","The climax is the worst of all bond movies.i would have directed better , given a chance, in half sleep. First an hour is solid action and story but it all goes downhill jet speed after interval. the signature tune is also not used effectively, all in all , a major disappointment.Craig is likable but seems indifferent to it all. even movies like cellular, rush hour , premium rush manages to sustain interest till end of it. went for first day first show, need to get compensated with a good movie. what is not managed in a two hour movie is better managed in multiple one hour episodes of 24 and burn notice. awaiting jack reacher.",4,16,37,3 November 2012
It Follows," a must see
",a real surprise . i am not a horror movie lover but this one has been a classy surprise. only wish it could have ended same way but with one difference that comes to mind.if the curse has to be passed on then it will be passed on and on but it can come back to nail the previous one in the chain after many years also so they must have shown a grown up older and it follows and ends there. what a good experience not having the usual loud scares. it will be a challenge to create an equally engaging sequel.its shot beautifully and with less of gore. after leaving the theatre one keeps on the feeling that its following. keep looking at people around you. fantastic effect.,8,76,152,12 April 2015
Gone Girl," overrated
","the movie has one of th worst Police Investigation. or lack of it. The book was boring enough to keep a certain expectation from the film. for its sheer wonder why will anyone put big efforts to put it in visuals. countless flaws. so much acclaim for Ben n others act , it hardly impresses. Ben sleepwalks thru it. the lawyer character is a joke as the police investigators. read any Hadley chase book to know how a what next feeling should be created. ordered the book online then waited for movie release. both disappointed big time. The little more efforts one could take while writing a crime novel is learn more about police investigations.Maybe the hype made them good money but the least the makers could have done is reduce the length of film to half. one watching it would have suffered half. small mercy.",3,10,33,11 November 2014
Zero Dark Thirty," Superb
","Its not a typical action movie. Though it could easily could have been one, with lot of scope for action. But the way its presented. absolutely mind numbing.Stunning. Definitely qualifies for repeat viewing. Though i had not much liked the hurt locker, this one is superb. It would have been very tempting to have added usual spices to cater to general peoples taste but it would have lost its impact. And what an impact. So much goes behind to set a thing right. America has shown just that to the world.Do not watch it anyway else than on big screen.it deserves an Oscar and will get it.what an effort.the climax is how a climax should be, pulsating.",9,0,4,16 February 2013
Joker," siding the wrong
","What? every criminal every wrongdoer has his excuse which he uses as his defending reason for all the ghastly act that he may commit. and there are people to spread his good word & work? Hope it doesnt get any worse than this, and calling this a masterpiece, should get the head examined. Maniacal acting, not one shining moment. Waste of good time.the one star is for the title THE END.",1,25,85,10 October 2019
