Casablanca," I love this movie
","Great movie, great music, great story, great acting, great cinematography, great everything. Humphrey Bogart brings his tough but cool persona, Ingrid Bergman brings an elegant but fragile charm, Claude Rains steals every scene he's in with his quick wit and impeccable comedic timing, Conrad Veidt plays the antagonist beautifully and menacingly, Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre provide solid support in smaller roles that show off their shadier sides. The story is just perfect, its complicated so it requires constant attention but it moves by so fast and and never lets up that it is a real joy to watch. This film never has a dull moment, it will have you laughing in one scene and in the next it will have wrenched your heart out. Its shot in a romantic but noir type style that is impossible to take your eyes off of. The music is so moody and romantic it fits the music perfectly and it comes in at all the right moments, never taking away from a scene. The acting never goes over the top or anything, it just stays perfect. The person who I think sticks out the most and embodies the feel of this film would have to be Claude Rains. In one moment he can be so riotously funny and in the next he's as serious as he can be, just like the pace of the film. This really is the perfect movie and I strongly urge anyone who has not seen it to see it.",10,2,4,20 October 2010
Taxi Driver," dark
","This film is dark. Its depressing. Its unsettling. Its violent and brutal. Its real. This film captures a desperate realism perfectly. Everything feels natural yet at the same time unsettling. This is a world we don't want to live in but we all live in it. We don't want to live in this world but we do and there's no escaping it. Thats exactly what Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) tries to do. He's not a hero, not by any means. This is an incredibly sick man who somehow manages to kind of maybe do something 'good'. The whole film is just twisted and unsettling. We watch Bickles decent into madness. DeNiro is perfection. He is so good in this movie. Harvey Keitel is brilliant in his smaller role as a pimp. Their scenes together are some of the best in the film. Even when DeNiro is alone his acting is incredible. The camera work is flashy but in a detached and bleak sense. Scorsese gives it his all. This is a film that doesn't feel cut, it flows from one scene to the next. There is nothing bad I can say about this film. Its just perfect",10,0,0,11 December 2010
The Grapes of Wrath," Great movie
","I have nothing but praise for this film. It is near perfection. Beautiful cinematography. Amazing acting. Powerful story about survival. Henry Fonda delivers what might be his best performance as Tom Joad a man struggling to get by but who eventually realizes that he is meant for greater things and that there's more to life than just helping yourself. The film is masterfully directed by John Ford and beautifully shot by cinematographer Gregg Toland. The outdoor shots are grand and bleak at the same time, bringing about a feeling of the insignificance of man compared to nature and the grand scheme of things. The lighting will go from very dark and depressing showing the characters in deep moments of suffering only for it to be broken by brightly lit moments where all seems well in the world. See this movie, that is all i have to say. Words almost fail to describe just how great this movie is",Null,1,2,20 October 2010
The Exorcist," solid but not the scariest
","This is a very good movie. Its a brilliantly intense and visceral experience. Pay no attention to the lame publicity that surrounds this film. Things that try to enhance the scares. 'THE VERSION YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE'. This is all stupid crap designed to force feed you the idea that this is the most frightening movie of all time. Its not. It's a very good and very intense film but don't believe the hype. It will only scare you if you believe in the subject matter, if not it'll still provide a worthwhile experience. This film took guts to make. Considering the fact that this was a major studio film, it has balls. The things that happen in this film hit you like a ton of bricks. The scene with the crucifix or the scene with the statue of the virgin Mary are enough to leave almost anyone's jaw dropped in shock. The camera work is great, it leaves a lot of stuff out of frame and up to the imagination. The lighting is great because sometimes it doesn't try to obscure the scary images with shadows, it shows you the horror in natural light. It enhances the world in which this film takes place. It feels real. The acting is solid, you have some really Oscar worthy performances in a horror film. Everything comes together perfectly in this film to create a solid horror experience. It's a horror movie that feels like a character drama that feels like a horror movie...if that makes sense",10,2,3,11 December 2010
The Graduate," amazing movie
","This has to be one of my all time favorites. There is nothing quite like this film. Nothing can ever recapture the feeling of this film. Its completely unique and one of a kind. It captures the feeling of social isolation perfectly. The editing and camera work are amazing, completely off the wall but amazing. So many quick cuts. The sound design is perfection. This film looks and sounds spectacular, its like you can hear every little detail. It really pulls you in, you get wrapped up in this world. Its a world we've probably all been at least once in our lives. Even though its main focus is on the generation gap of the 60s, this film still feels relevant today. Dustin Hoffman is at his best, he's so awkward, dorky, socially inept and charming. He has a lot of flaws but you can't help but root for this guy. This is one of the best films I have ever seen and it is possibly one of the best ever made",10,1,1,11 December 2010
Psycho," amazing film
","pure suspense and unease. This film relies on all sorts of tricks and moods to get you wrapped up in the events that unfold. Certain camera angles leave lots of space within the frame, you keep thinking, somethings going to pop out at any minute. Sometimes the camera gets really close and it feels awkward and disconcerting. There are so many uncomfortable moments in this film. It toys with you. It didn't shy away from taboo subjects. You honestly don't know where it will go until you get there. Anthony Perkins is amazing in this, he's both very human and likable but uncomfortably awkward at the same time. The music really sets the mood, it never lets up in its intensity. This is the perfect thriller because it knows that the best thing to show is almost nothing. Imply everything. Leave it up to the imagination, it'll be much worse that way.",10,0,0,16 December 2010
