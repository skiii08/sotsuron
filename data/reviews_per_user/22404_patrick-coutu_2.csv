First Man," Rewarding at the end
","I 'really, really, really' enjoyed the last 30 minutes! It was like winning a prize after two hours of hard drama. The first two hours are sticked to Neil Armstrong's life at home and NASA and depicts mostly dramatic personal events that lead to the Apollo 11 launch. I learned and was reminded about some of them but it's a rude and sometimes very dark ride that leads to the launch, arriving, landing, setting foot on the Moon and return to Earth.The icing on the cake for this film is at the end. The music and visual of the landing reminded Interstellar's best moments but in a real situation setting. 'Hey, for all mankind, we are going to land on the MOON!!'It's the Neil Armstrong and Apollo 11 story. In no way another Apollo 13 or Right Stuff.The only important things missing are why Armstrong wanted to be an astronaut and the World Tour that came after the landing. I wanted to see this depicted as it was important.Still a fine movie but it could be a lot less long at some points.",7,3,7,22 November 2018
Captain Marvel," Wonder Woman was a lot better
","I've enjoyed Wonder Woman, Black Panther or even Ant-Man far better than this one. I didn't expect anything spectacular going in the theater but was mad about paying for something blant, boring and dull. IMO, it's a forgettable entry in the MCU.",5,1,3,10 March 2019
