Requiem for a Dream," I couldn't look away!
","It's hard to know how to describe this film, it's certainly its own piece of art but I just could not look away from the screen. And the music just keeps drawing you in to each scene. The content makes it hard to feel like it was entertaining but it was definitely an experience. I feel like good movies are becoming hard to come by and this one, despite becoming quite old, grabs your attention and holds it for the full time.I'm not sure why people are leaving 1 star reviews, I feel they are unable to just appreciate a film for what it is. There are many absolutely terrible movies and people still give them between 3-5/10 so I feel these are definitely unjust for the film. This was not a terrible movie in the slightest, while it might not be for everyone, it is worth the watch and definitely better than 1/10.",9,1,1,8 August 2019
