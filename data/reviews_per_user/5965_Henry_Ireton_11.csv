Black Swan," A good film which man not be for everyone,
","BLACK SWAN Nina is a ballerina in a New York City ballet company who lives with her obsessive former ballerina mother. The company will begin it's new season with Swan Lake, a ballet which requires a dancer who can play both the White Swan with innocence and grace, and the Black Swan which represents guile and sensuality. Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily, her competition is the personification of the Black Swan. As Nina attempts to fill both roles she begins to get more in touch with her dark side and assume the persona of each.The film keeps you thinking throughout. The harsh reality of the extreme physical nature of professional dancing is well presented and Black Swan dips into the emotional nightmare it can become. Despite this aspect of the film it never begs sympathy of the audience but the dancers merely go about their business of pushing the body to it's limits. Whilst this is not specifically a dance film, and is not an adaptation of Swan Lake, there are enough truly graceful scenes to be enjoyed by those who appreciate the artform.The cast are for the most part faultless, Natalie Portman is vulnerable when she is required to be and demonic when called upon, Barbara Hershey is quite brilliant as the overbearing and rather quite scary mother whilst Mila Kunis is pleasantly surprising in her role. So well did she fit into the role of Lila that at no point in the film did i think of Meg Griffin. There are some brief moments which could be considered of the horror/genre but the film never really edges into that arena. Instead the first half of the film is spent on character and plot development, we are drawn quite far into the film before things begin to take a turn. This i felt showed patience on the part of the director and a trust that the audience would stay with it. Despite such a long build up the film does not drag for a combination of plot, events and dance keep you interested and involved.Black Swan is a compelling film, it needs thought and attention, unsurprisingly it is not for everyone. I enjoyed it.8/10",8,0,2,11 January 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Worst yet
","I throughly enjoyed Pirates 1 and 2, but felt three was drifting off too much.. this one is the worst yet.It starts off OK, wonderful sets of 18th century London and has the typical Pirates action from the very beginning. The first 15 minutes or so are quite entertaining however it then drifts into a disconnected story (losely based on several factual characters) and the continuation of the Jack Sparrow story. Not wishing to spoil, but it becomes all a bit too supernatural and ridiculous, there are moments of humour but few and far between. The location is clearly Hawaii and does not look remotely Caribbean which was rather annoying, perhaps it should have been called pirates of the Pacific.Anyway, all that aside this is a poor reflection of the first two films and honestly it was disappointing, somewhat laboured and one couldn't help feel it's A sour end to what should have remained a trilogy.",2,4,9,26 May 2011
Frost_Nixon," Frost not Nixon
","Frost Nixon Frank Langella Michael Sheen I must confess that ordinarily this is not a film I would have watched. However, seeing Michael Sheen interviewed on Top Gear where Clarkson said what a great performance it was I thought I'd watch it for myself.Director Ron Howard takes us to a time when the US were involved in a war they couldn't win, occupying a country they shouldn't be in and their President was caught lying. Sound familiar? It's an engrossing narrative and Howard does an excellent job of taking you back to the 60's by using subtle things such as a close up of Frost's Italian shoes, cleverly reminding us that few people traveled by plane and excellent overall set and costume design.The film begins when David Frost is in Australia and not yet having found the infamy of 'through the keyhole' he decides that he's going to spend his own money, and borrow other peoples to pay Nixon heavily and get the one and only interview with the disgraced ex president.There's a real risk with a film like this for it to become a narcissistic ramble but it's not slow nor does it drag on, instead it's a well told story, enough factual information to give the feeling you're watching History channel without the dumbing down, but equally enough drama to keep you engrossed in the film. Despite already knowing the outcome, ( if you don't know what happened, look away now) your rooting for Frost to succeed, and in all it's a thoroughly enjoyable and watch able film. Michael Sheen plays Frost, and Frank Langella plays Nixon as the two come together for what would later become an epic interview. There are some other important roles and given the flood of information in this film there is no time for character development so all of whom have to be strong out of the blocks, and fortunately they all are.Here's my problem with the film. Michael Sheen is brilliant as Frost, capturing just enough of his character ( as he did with Tony Blair in 'The Queen' ) to make it believable without being distracting, where as Frank Langella's performance as Nixon is more like something from Saturday Night Live or some other comedy show. You feel that Sheen is playing a character, bringing subtle aspects of the real Frost to the screen and you don't feel your watching him 'trying' to be Frost, where as Langella is trying to impersonate Nixon and it doesn't work. Additionally, films about Nixon have been done a thousand times, this film is about how Frost against all odds got the old codger to agree to an interview and then against all expectations got an on screen admission of guilt. It is, as much if not more about Frost's efforts as it is about Nixon's guilt. Why then, if the film is called Frost Nixon, and Sheen is masterful while Langella struggles, is Frank Langella given top billing? It's a rhetorical question, we know exactly why.So, to confirm Clarkson was right, gripping, interesting, enthralling.8/10",8,2,4,13 April 2010
Pirate Radio," Appalling bad film that missed a Golden opportunity
","Following WW2 Britain was almost bankrupt. Having given every penny to the American's for food & weapons in 1958, Britannia was so broke the Empire had to be taken apart every colony given independence by 61. The government had a plan to deal with mass starvation bread, cheese, milk, etc was rationed for fifteen years after the war. During the 60's/70's there were three TV stations on British TV and all finished by 10pm, a government directive as there was not enough coal to waste on power stations for TVs. From this economic hardship grew a youth of anti establishmentarianism, a sixties youth, somewhat different to that in the US who fought street battles over civil rights and Vietnam, the British revolution was one of youth culture.By the mid sixties Britain was the cultural center of the world, Carnaby street was a Mecca for fashion,Twiggy and Audrey Hepburn drove Mini's, and British music took over the world. Beatles, Stones, Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Van Morrison, T-Rex, The Who, Kinks.Despite all this there was nowhere for all this incredible music to be played, the BBC controlled the airwaves and would not play rock music a week. And so in 1966 as England lifted the World cup at Wembley, pirate radio was born. Transmitting from ships just outside UK waters these pirate stations gave the nation the music they wanted to hear played 24 hours a day by DJ's who were radical and far removed from the stuffy British BBC presenters. It was a golden age of rebellion.Now the history lesson is over how about the movie? It's centered around a Pirate radioship somewhere in the NorthSea. A Richard Curtis film, the man behind those British films with red buses,blackcabs, BigBen and red phoneboxes on every corner. You expect a very British feel, a very sixties feel, but somehow neither are there. There's certainly a lot of 60's crockery, paraphernalia, posters and clothes but the sense of the sixties is missing. Apart from it all being a bit too bright and sunny ( we tend to remember powercuts,candles,and rain when we think of 60/70's Britain ) it's the cast who are a major problem. Casting Director Fiona Weir has dipped from a pool of cliché Brit actors and one token American ( Seymore Hoffman ), Bill Nighy plays Quentin, the only character with any sixties feel, however the character is no different to the part Nighy played in Love Actually and is more like a has-been living trapped in the past than actually being there. The direction is not strong enough to compensate for the names and faces we are too familiar with and associated with other things. I believe it would have been far better to cast relatively unknowns, perhaps Tow Waits instead of Seymore Hoffman and Geoffrey Rush instead of Nighy. Whilst set decoration, props and costume design are marvelous ultimately the dialogue, plot and director let it fail.The roll of Carl is disappointing. From the beginning Carl feels like a lead character but as the film progresses there is no development or lead character. The film ambles through its plot,a thread here and there but nothing of consequence, whilst all the time none of the characters are developed. Carl is seen several times with a camera and I wanted him to become involved, perhaps gradually becoming a photo journalist or something, becoming integral to the story, but nothing other than an iffy love interest. I don't like making comparisons but taking Pirate Radio and compare it to Scandal or Almost Famous that in Almost Famous characters are well developed, the young journalist becomes engrossed in the world around him, it's not about a band being on the road or about the 70's, it's about a boy, full of admiration who through his experiences realises that the people he admires so much are just people with weaknesses and flaws. It's about self discovery, learning and all the time the film has a definite 70's feel. Scandal is biographical based on the political life of Profumo and is masterful at recreating the sixities using three actors and one popstar who were relatively unknown at the time. Pirate Radio has none of that. It's a film project that really could have gone in two ways, Curtis could have taken a literal biographical approach and told the story of real events as did Scandal. Or he could have focused on a single aspect as did Almost Famous, but instead he goes for a 3rd weak, wandering, nonentity of a story.What is glorious about Pirate Radio is the soundtrack. Given that everything else is so weak it does leave you wondering if Richard Curtis was home one day thumbing through his record collection and though 'how can I get all these great tracks into one film.. Oooh I know.. Pirate Radio' and that's where the inspiration ended. But the soundtrack is possibly one of the best movie soundtracks ever and as a huge music anorak type person I loved the end credit sequence with the album covers.Don't get me wrong, Pirate Radio is not an atrocious film, it harmless and worth watching for a bit of fun, It's just this is the music of my youth, I recall whilst growing up, listening to Radio Caroline a pirate radio station that broadcast from a ship offshore right up until the late 1970's and I was just expecting and wanting something much more from the film, something celebrating that wonderful British 60's and early 70's culture, a film that given the subject could have and should have become a great British Cult Music movie, it's quite saddening because Pirate Radio never will and Curtis completely missed the opportunity. Instead the film is just OK. I give it three as a film and ten for the soundtrack which averages as 6.56/10",6,3,6,7 September 2010
Salt," Absolute RUBBISH
","I thought that this film would be an exciting mix of action, thriller, espionage and drama. Instead it's an overblown farce and a plot resembling blancmange. Angelina Jolie plays a spy for the CIA who turns out to be a Russian spy as well. So she gets exposed and runs away (but somehow doesn't look anything the action figure of Lara Croft but quite ungainly and pathetic) and uses a black wig and sunglasses like a Matrix character which doesn't hide her at all. In fact, at one point when trying to allude the CIA she disguises herself in a Russian fur hat and fur coat. Hilarious! In another scene she randomly picks some dry cleaning off a rail in a hotel and surprise surprise the suit fits like it's tailored. Her disguise to go into the White House is just so ridiculous that you actually feel shame for the director and make up artist. Interestingly throughout the film special agent 'Salt' does not kill a single American, however she kills every Russian she can. And we are supposed to be wondering if she's a Russian spy? This film is so bad and panders so shamefully to the uneducated ill informed American conception of an evil enemy that really the only thing missing is the idea of an Arab funding it all from a cave in Afghanistan.The film ends, thankfully, but unthankfully with Jolie running off into the woods,fade to black and you can just here the film studio setting up storyboards for a sequel. Oh please NO.Total rubbish. 1/10",1,144,245,28 August 2010
Pride & Prejudice," Shameful execution of a classic masterpiece
","Pride & Prejudice Pride & Prejudice is one of English Literatures all time classic novels, one which has over the years been adapted into television drama, stage play and film. This 2005 re-working directed by Joe Wright sadly misses the mark.For me, the film falls down tremendously in so many areas beginning with the director and cinematography, or lack of. One might argue that good bread doesn't need butter and likewise such a wonderful novel needs no directorial spin, but given the locations in which P&P is set, and that it was an age when the British were becoming aware of nature and the concept of appreciating natural wonders, I felt that there is such scope for beautifully shot scenes of English countryside with dew covered cobwebs in hedgerows and misty morning sunrises. With the exception of one sweeping landscape filmed in Yorkshire there is nothing in the way of cinematography. Scenes were shot often from a few limited camera angles and whilst I'm not suggesting the film needed CGI and gimmicks I did feel it lacked any real sense of the director input and in that way failed to stand out from any of the previous adaptations.Another failing for me was the casting of Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennett and Matthew Macfadyn As Darcy. It must be said that in 1995 Colin Firth claimed the role his own and even twenty years later it must be a fairly daunting task to take it on given the standard set. Which begs the question why cast Macfadyn, a Welshman with a Welsh accent? As distracting as this may be it pales in comparison to his expressionless face. A more dull and tedious portrayal of Darcy I am yet to see, and hope I never do for ?Macfadyn I believe would have been far better cast as the Intolerable Mr Collins as he lacked any of the charisma one associates with the character of Darcy. Donald Sutherland was also poorly cast I felt. Has had a wide an illustrious career, but Sutherland's portrayal of characters is often limited in their depth and he is not an actor who immediately springs to mine when thinking of Mr Bennett. Given the immense depths of British character, film, TV and stage actors far more capable of playing the role, and without the monotonous Canadian accent of Sutherland, the viewer is left to believe that he was cast purely as a 'household' name to put large US buttocks onto US cinema seats, perhaps the money behind the film felt Keira Knightly herself and the title of Pride & Prejudice alone was not enough.Which brings me to Keira Knightly. From the moment we are introduced to Knightly as Elizabeth Bennett I could not see how this adaptation could redeem itself. There is nothing eighteenth century about Knightly, not her frame, features, mannerisms and she never looks anything other than a 21st century girl dressed by wardrobe. You only have to go back 100 years to see that any woman over 5' was considered tall, 5'2' was a veritable giant. I'm not suggesting the cast should all have been short, but a tall talentless actress in a Georgian frock does not an Elizabeth Bennett make. Yet it gets worse, Keira must have convinced herself that the little nose wrinkling snigger and Cheshire cat grin would somehow be endearing when in fact it was irritating and off putting.It was then, a disastrous adaptation, one not befitting of the weighty name it carries and a shameful disappointment. Those wishing to see this classic novel in celluloid form would be better off finding the 1995 BBC dramatisation with Colin Firth.3/10",3,3,7,8 January 2011
Invictus," Another Great human interest film from Eastwood
","Invictus Morgan Freeman Matt Damon Nursing a hangover in a flat somewhere in Upton Park, East London that's where I was. Not when I watched Invictus, when Mandela was released I mean. Isn't it supposed to be one of those 'where were you when' moments? Well I'd crashed the night in Upton Park after a party and everyone sat around watching it on TV.Invictus is about those early years of the new South Africa after Mandela became president. A new nation, a new democracy, a new anthem and a new hope. The film chooses to focus on one aspect of those moments, South Africa's rugby team the Springboks. For those who don't know rugby, due to the aparthied system the Springboks were alienated for decades unable to play in international tournaments. By the time Mandela was president of the new RSA, they were awarded the hosting of the 1995 Rugby World Cup as a reward. Rugby at that time was considered a whiteman's sport in South Africa, not taken to by the black population who preferred soccer, and rugby was a symbol of the apartied oppression. Director Clint Eastwood focuses on how against all odds Mandela helped the Springboks not only manage greatness on the rugby field but using the world cup and the rejuvenating national pride to became a truly national team and a unifying force.The story is well told in a good chronological and factual order, nothing is hazy or left unexplained. It would have been easy if not tempting to fill the movie with rugby but no doubt at the risk of alienating some of the audience and Clint Eastwood, who as a director has always found great human interest stories has created a good balance between action, character development and drama, although I felt the onfield rugby action was a little soft. It's always hard to capture sport in film, and I would go as far as to say only the 1960's 'Grand Prix' and 'Any Given Sunday' have successfully managed to do it. One wonders whether Eastwood would have been better off using actual game footage but for those non rugby enthusiasts it was probably fine as it is.Freeman is more than excellent as Mandela. He is able to capture the warmness Mandela projected, his mannerisms and body posture to make himself believable and likable. He also brings a subtle enough attempt at Mandela's vocal range that whilst it slips from time to time and you know it's not Mandela and you are aware Freeman is trying to be Mandela it doesn't spoil the character. Matt Damon puts in a strong performance as François Pienaar but I felt that not enough was made of Pienaar character and this it must be said is not Damon's fault but Eastwoods. I remember those days well, and as much as I detested seeing South Africa win rugby, it must be said that Pienaar was indeed a fantastic spokesman, ambassador even not only the sport but for his country.Eastwood Concentrates on Mandela pushing the Springboks and pushing the country to get behind them and yes it was a tremendous act of reconciliation given their political and racial attachments, but Pienaar was instrumental in making Mandela's plan work and without him both on and off the field the Bokke would not exist today. Sadly Matt Damon was limited to playing Pienaar as a sportsman , the occasional motivational speech and a limited dialogue I just felt not enough was made of Pienaar's real ability to lead by example both on and off the field. I never liked the Springboks as a team, especially after the most recent World Cup ( or Australian video referees) but it must be said Pienaar was a superb ambassador for the sport and his country and this does not come across in the film. Other than that it's an engaging film, there's some nice character development threads amongst Mandela's staff, the security forces and the Springbok players, the script is strong and there's a definite positive energy about the film, it leaves you with that sense of hope South Africa had back then. Looking at South African then and the South Africa now is as much as testimony to Mandela's greatness and it's such a shame it's all gone downhill since Mandela handed over the reigns. You don't need to be a rugby fan to enjoy this film, excellent.",8,0,0,13 April 2010
From Hell," A ripping yarn? Or a schizophrenic tale?
","What do you get if you mix Edward Elgar, Take That and Ministry of Sound at Ibiza? You get 'From Hell'. This film is a mix of historical fact ( Elgar), urban legend ( Take That) and surreal drama ( MOS Ibiza) coming together to form a strange yet enjoyable dance.The film is set in Victorian London when the poorer classes of London's Whitechapel area lived in fear of the most infamous serial killer Jack the Ripper. Directed by the Hughes Brothers, much is made of Inspector Abeline's opium, Absynth and strychnine addiction, something associated more with Sherlock Holmes than Abeline although historically accurate as the drugs of choice for the Victorian gent in London .Johnny Depp, an actor who seems to pick roles which allow him to showcase his versatility is convincing as Abeline, the unfortunate detective who became a sacrificial scapegoat offered up to the frustrated and furious Londoners by a powerful Masonic order. His London accent varies through the film and is reminiscent of his Jack Sparrow. Choosing to understate the role and not to go over the top with the drug scenes or action, but play it in the calm controlled way expected of a Victorian gent. It's tempting to compare Depp's Inspector Abeline with Robert Downey Jr's Holmes but one should remember Holmes was fictional allowing RDJ to go over the top, where as Abeline is real and Depp plays it more so.The tale of Jack the Ripper is well known, this version however explores a particular belief that Jack had royal connections and was protected by the Masonic order. The film is filled with factual aspects such as the pressure put upon Abeline to find a Jew butcher as the murderer, the chalk writing being washed off the wall and the intentional misspelling of Juwes. Equally it's full of assumptions, however I couldn't help feeling it's the closest any film has come to the truth. No one has ever sufficiently answered how Jack the Ripper was able to get in and out of east London unseen and un stopped, and the murders, swift and brutal over a short period seemed to end as quickly as they had begun without reason or answer.The plot is simple to follow and unfolds with ease as the film progresses, there are no surprises or ridiculous unbelievable twists but there are some problems with the film. You're repeatedly bombarded with surreal drug influenced moments, expected to believe in a miss fitting romance subplot, asked not to question set and costume design which is accurately Victorian but seems too clean and bright for the age. Perhaps the directors felt Abeline's drug induced visions were important and purposely avoided the classic Victorian smog and squalor we think of to give a bright and fresh feel . Additionally, less is made of Jack the Ripper's acts themselves. Given that the film is titled 'From Hell' which is how the genuine Ripper letters were addressed, surprisingly the letters and body parts he sent to the newspapers and Scotland Yard is hardly touched upon as the film seems to concern itself more with Abeline and the Masons rather than Jack and his actions. We shouldn't forget how disturbed the mind of Jack the Ripper was and perhaps the fact that somehow these events were indeed covered up, even to this day, the directors were perhaps right to focus on those who sought to perpetrate the cover up than remake a story told so many times before. That said all these things do leave you feeling that the film is not sure of it's own identity and is somewhat confused, schizophrenic even. Enjoyable none the less.7/10",7,2,3,3 April 2010
Inception," Too contrived
","INCEPTION The dialogue in this film is preoccupied with explaining what is happening, rather than being natural. This is very possibly due to the director feeling the concept of the film was too complicated for mere cinema goers to comprehend and instead of enhancing the film as a good flowing natural dialogue might it in fact has a tendency to spoil the film. It is also very repetitive, continually repeating the rules of inception, the inner workings of the dream construction. It becomes very annoying and I'm sure Inception holds the world record for saying the word 'dream' more times than any other.There is a concept in teaching, developed by the Americans which goes like this, tell the people what you are going to teach them, then teach it to them, then tell them what is was you just taught them. It seems the director has adopted this method of explaining to the audience, just in case they are too stupid to get it for themselves, what the film is about and what is happening.Di Caprio who in my opinion is a talented actor that often picks challenging roles was neither commanding nor outstanding. Partly due to the lack of any real structure to the film as the whole thing seemed too fluid and poured out in a tsunami of CGI. Additionally there is no kind of character development, something Di Caprio is generally masterful at, leaving the film feeling hollow and a waste of an otherwise talented cast. Something Hollywood studios will often do when trying to portray highly intelligent criminals (or evil masterminds) is cast British actors, and it is noticeable in Inception that director Christopher Nolan has not broken away from the stereotype.A previous reviewer wrote 'The stupid dialog is there, because Nolan did not know, how to push the plot forward in an integrated way' and i totally agree.I've heard a lot about how Inception is the new Matrix and I must confess I have never watched Matrix, I did sit down and try, on three occasions to do so, but all three times i fell asleep out of sheer boredom. That is not sarcasm it is real. I know the Matrix story as it's so well known, whether or not Inception is the new Matrix i cannot say but I can confess it's a fairly redundant mediocre film with an over contrived plot strung together by cliché action scenes. The plot concept is not so difficult to comprehend and seems to be hyped up for what it really is. The only real thought needed is that of the closing shot, (this is not a spoiler ).. does it tip or does it keep spinning? I smell a sequel.3/10",3,19,35,3 September 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Elementary My Dear Ritchie
","The first thought I had when hearing about this film was one of disappointment that director Guy Ritchie had clearly pandered to the American box office audience and chosen an American to play Sherlock Holmes, the quintessential Victorian gent. However it must be said that RDJ does an excellent job at portraying the opium addicted waster genius of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's books so over looked and avoided by other versions of the film.There is an odd sort of chemistry between RDJ and Jude Law which makes this particular pairing of Holmes and Watson one you like and care about. Jude Law is not one of my favourite actors but he seems to get it just right as Watson and you sympathise with him the entire film. Whilst both characters are portrayed in a way that is totally unreal for the age in which the film is set, they are real as characters. Ritchie gives them the earthiness we've come to expect and throws a degree of London wide boy into the mix as Victorian London meets Lock Stock and two smokers. As a director he has clearly unshackled Jude Law from the chains of Nigel Davenports bumbling Watson and freed Downey from the pompousness of Basil Rathbone's Holmes.The CGI is excellent and not over worked, Ritchie thankfully holding back from using too much CGI but instead there is a wonderful use of set & costume design which really adds an ambiance to the movie and carries you off to the age. Dialogue is rich and strong, the script and plot carries nicely and you feel yourself on a roller-coaster ride not wanting to get off.Here comes the spoiler, of sorts, you are inevitable introduced to professor Moriarty, those of you familiar with the books would have guessed it all along so it's not really a spoiler as such, but Ritchie cleverly introduces you to him in a way which leaves the movie hanging and you walk out the theatre with the sense of an impending sequel or series of Holmes Movies to follow, and why not? This was a great film which I thoroughly enjoyed, I didn't want it to end and would urge people not to wait for the DVD but go to see it on the big screen.",9,0,0,1 February 2010
RED," Red & Knight & Day
","Red and Knight & Day I decided to review these two films on my facebook reviews together as they are in some ways comparable.In the first, Knight & Day, Cameron Diaz, Day, is returning home for her sisters wedding when she stumbles upon Tom Cruise, Knight, a CIA agent who having been set up as a patsy is forced to go undercover and on the run. Through a set of unbelievable circumstances the two embark on a farcical roller-coaster ride of espionage and death defying feats.In Red, Bruce Willis is a retired CIA agent who having pressed the wrong switches upset someone lurking in the shadows. Forced out of hiding he joins up with fellow CIA retirees John Malkovitz, Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren. Together they too embark on a farcical roller-coaster ride of espionage and death defying feats.This however is where the two films part company.When Cruise and Diaz appeared on Top Gear, (UK) Jeremy Clarkson said of the two Hollywood actors 'this is where humans will be in 100 years when evolution has reached perfection'. Sadly I disagree. What comes out from this film that you do not have in Red is that very Hollywood obsession with appearance. The need to have endless cosmetic surgery, reconstructive dental work and lifts in your shoes. Peel away the make up, remove the implants and fake faces and what you have is very normal looking people. This is relevant to the cause as Knight & Day seems lost where as Red knows its own identity. Action packed and full of CGI and exploding things, stunts and gun battles both films are fun to behold. Cruise leaps from moving vehicles and hand to hand combat with sharks, it is the consummate Tom Cruise film, but in the same breath it's not an action film. It has the underlying feeling that it's a comedy action. A problem arises however, because it's not funny. The key element in comedy is humour and in Knight & Day there is at no point a moment when you laugh. It is then simply a film of no substance, same old same old, which rides on the back of America's, and now the world's, obsession with 'beautiful people looking beautiful'. The problem with beautiful people sitting around looking beautiful is that nothing ever gets done. God made most people either ugly or normal looking so we could do things slightly more important than walk up and down a catwalk. And this brings us to Red.In Red, the lead characters are all old, wrinkled and gray. There's not cosmetically enhanced beautiful people leaping from rooftops but normal people undertaking equally improbable things as in Knight & Day with the exception that they can all act far better than Cruise or Diaz. There is as much action packed exploding CGI things and despite their age none of the cast look out of place or struggle to be convincing. Red mercifully never takes itself too serious but with tongue in cheek catapults the ridiculous characters into the impossible with full vigour and there is more humour to boot.I enjoyed both films, both are best described as 'cerebrally relaxing' and would give them each 7/10 for entertainment value, the downside is that one ends with the overwhelming feeling that a sequel will be following along behind and it's not actually the one you want to see more of.Red is Good Fun 7/10",7,0,0,8 January 2011
