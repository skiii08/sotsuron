Hereditary," A beautiful, psychologically terrifying film
","I was lucky in that I had never read a review or synopsis of this film before viewing. So from the beginning, I had no idea where it was going. I hate to compare it to another film because it is unique on its own, but I am reminded of Rosemary's Baby, where for most of the film you are wondering if you are just watching a masterful character study of madness in a claustrophobic NY apartment. At the end of that film you realize you have watched a film about contemporary satanism. 
Hereditary keeps you on the edge of your seat. It keeps you guessing. It's a slow boil of pychological horror. You also have the sense that you are watching a master filmmaker at work, an auteur to watch. 
I won't give anything away but in the last act of this film, you are exhausted and terrified. You are not exactly sure what you just saw. I will say this. There is no way in the beginning of this film to predict how it will end. There are enough pychological twists and moments of pure horror that it will keep you thinking about it for days after.",9,8,14,6 September 2018
Ready Player One," I hated every minute of this movie.
","I rented this thinking, 'how bad can it be?' Well it's a whole lot worse than I ever imagined. I give it 3 stars for some of the set pieces and impressive 3D.",3,0,1,9 August 2018
Justice League," Superhero movie without any heroes.
","It has evolved to the point where these movies are like candy bars, and every year they put the same crap candy bar in a new wrapper. Candy tastes good but it has no nutrional value and is bad bad for us. These movies are soulless. There is no humanity in them. If you look at the best action movies - the Bourne trilogy and any Jason Stratham film - we are invested in the humanity of the leads. The fight scenes are thrilling because we care about the characters outcomes. The fight scenes in all of these comic book movies, even in Black Panther, are indistinguishable. There's so much 3D and special effects it looks plastic. Justice League is the worst of the lot. 3D characters interact with green screen characters. There are explosions and fire, superhero's and villains thrown into walls. Walls collapsing. Buildings collapsing. Light streaks. Lens flares. Sparks falling from ceilings. Yet, as a viewer, these are great times to go make a sandwich. I find myself wishing that all of these characters would die off in a fiery explosion. Another key point is that these films reek of fear. The fear is that none of these characters can carry a film by themselves - you have groups of these gayly dressed men and the occasional woman all fighting a villain that really no one cares about. John Wayne hated High Noon because the protagonist was a coward. He was a coward who couldn't stand up and fight by himself without the help of the villagers to support him in his own weakness. Wayne and many other famous directors thought that a film hero, especially a western hero, is obligated to overcome his own weaknesses and fight alone against the forces of injustice and evil. The reason for this is that men must face their own problems and injustices in their own lives alone. If you are underpaid and you feel it necessary to confront your own boss for a higher wage you don't bring your wife, your buddies, or your dad into the office to make the case for you. You do it alone. 
I watched The Apartment, the great Billy Wilder film last night. Jack Lemmon is a superhero in that film and he doesn't throw a single punch. He fights for true love and magnomity. He fights the corporate machine. He Fights peer pressure. In the end however his fight is with himself. He has to come clean with who he is, and he does it mostly by deciding who he is not. He's not a playboy or a ladies man though there is tremoundous cultural pressure to be so. He is not a corporate climber though that ethic was instilled into him. He falls in love with a girl who loves someone else. That someone else is a man of power who he fears but doesn't respect. In his fight he loses his job, his true love and his apartment. Yet he gains his self respect. He becomes a 'true man' not what culture has decided a man is. Of course being a true code hero, he does get the girl in the end. He does this by transforming her as well. She sees the hero in him which opens her eyes to her own shortcomings and bad decisions. That is what a hero does. There is nothing transformative about these comic book films. Maybe there was in the begging of all this. There are not any character arcs or growth. I propose that you are not even entertained by these films. So to me these superhero movies all lack one thing.

Midsommar," Ari Aster is the New Hitchcock.
","This isn't as terrifying and mind boggling as Hereditary but it's a terrific follow up. Both films follow similar themes: death of family members, struggles with grief, hallucinatory states of consciousness, and mysterious religious cults. I have always found psychological horror more terrifying than physical horror and though there are plenty of scares and murders it is the psychological dread that Aster's characters go through that is truly horrifying. Midsommar for the most part is the story of relationships. The lead, character, Dani suffers through a Horrifying family tragedy, and in her grief she is mostly alone in the world trying to cope with a her immense sadness. Her boyfriend seems void of any compassion And completely incapable of comforting her in a meaningful way. I think this is the central theme of the film. How does our modern, superficial society deal with profound loss and tragedy?
There's a terrifying scene where Dani, in Sweden for the first day with her boyfriend and his roommates takes hallucinatory drugs and has a really really bad trip. Knowing what she is going through personally and watching her unravel is both heart breaking and horrifying. From this moment on, most of the characters are in a sort of fugue state until the end of the film. The events that follow in Sweden are really what the film is about but it's our connection to Dani that makes what is absurd and shocking seem intimate and relatable.
Midsommar isn't so much a horror film as it is a psychological journey through hell, and for the most part it all happens in gorgeous sunlight in a breath taking landscape. This is no accident. Most horror films seem to take place in the dark because we are supposedly afraid of the dark but there are some pretty terrible things happening in broad daylight too.",8,2,4,10 October 2019
