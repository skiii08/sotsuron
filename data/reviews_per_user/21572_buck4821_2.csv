Raiders of the Lost Ark," A Hero is Born
","Raiders of the Lost Ark introduced the world to Indiana Jones, an archetypal action hero for all generations. This film shows Indy racing with the Nazis to attempt to uncover the lost Ark of the Covenant from the Christian Bible. Through the movie he faces many dangerous scenarios, cunningly escaping with a combination of wits and physical prowess. Aided by his now-famous whip in tight confrontations, and aided by his professor's cunning in puzzle situations, he skillfully demonstrates the ability to come out on top of every encounter.In the first scene of the movie, Indiana Jones is on an expedition to some country in South America where he goes into a cave and has to outsmart different levels of puzzles to eventually get a golden idol. He evades every trap, gets to the idol, and then outruns a giant boulder to the exit. Upon arrival at the exit, his archenemy Belloq confronts him with a small army and takes the idol from him. Seeing Indy escape so many perils with such skill foreshadows his ability to escape from great peril throughout the movie. Pretty early in the movie Indy meets with a woman named Marion who will have some clue about the location of the Ark. It becomes clear that she and Indy had a romantic past and shortly thereafter we learn that she also had a past with Belloq. Whenever a movie has two archenemies and a common romantic interest, the bad guy will take the girl captive and the hero will rescue her. Believe it or not, that all happens later on.One of the subtleties that are fun to watch throughout the movie is the famous Indiana Jones hat. Throughout every action scene, whether he is in a fist fight, in a pit of snakes, leaping across a bottomless pit, or racing through busy streets knocking over baskets carried on top of people's heads, it stays on his head, never once falling to the ground. Indy's always stationary hat is an adamant reminder of his unrelenting pursuit of good. The thing that makes Harrison Ford such a good Indiana Jones is how the acting in scenes of endless crises. When he falls into a pit of snakes, with Marion, and the 'tomb' gets sealed by Belloq, Ford doesn't revert to cheesy facial expressions or unnecessary gimmicks; instead he faces it with a calm demeanor that shows his analyst nature, always looking for the light at the end of the tunnel. One of the less subtle things that are pervasive is the use of the Nazis. They are shallowly developed characters, but that isn't necessary to the storyline. What keeps the story going is the symbolic motif that 'Nazis are bad' with anti-Nazi instigations. Nazi symbols burst into flame when near the Ark, the Nazis are all killed when they open the Ark, and when Indy tries to cling to a Mercedes-Benz hood ornament it snaps right off, Mercedes being a German company. The anti- Nazi symbolism used throughout the movie is pervasive enough to be noticed and humored but small enough to not create any serious backlash.The biggest thing that bothers me about solo action hero movies is that there is never any real fear for the main character. With only one main good guy, when he is in peril early on in the movie, there is always the notion that he will unduly escape and save the day. When a movie encompasses a group of good guys that the story connects, then the audience gets more fearful knowing that at any time anybody in the group could die. Indiana Jones is the sole purpose for this film, so putting him into danger as early as the first scene isn't necessarily for the danger aspect, but simply to build his character and reputation. Indiana Jones is the, not a, the, archetypal action hero. You can replace dozens of action heroes in other movies with Indiana Jones and you will often find the same result: Good guy saves the day, bad guys lose. Indy set the tone for generations to come for being a noble and skillful hero without accrediting fame or fortune: he taught when he wasn't on an adventure.",8,0,0,30 September 2012
The Godfather," Can't believe it took me so long to watch this
","The Godfather is a beautifully written piece about the inner workings of a mob family between 1945 and 1955. The main storyline is about a mob Don, Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando, and his two sons, Sonny and Michael, played by James Caan and Al Pacino respectively. Michael starts out as an outsider, with no interest in joining the 'family business.' The 'family business' is a term that is used frequently and carries heavy significance. Whenever they talk 'business,' they often use the phrase, 'It's not personal, it's just business.' They use it to convince not only society and the surrounding people but also themselves that what they are doing isn't as violent as it actually is. Using the family business ideal and constantly reminding themselves that what they are doing is business, not extortion, racketeering, and murder, helps them to cope with the violence and the guilt that comes with such activities. I think that one of the things that helps this movie along profusely is the acting of the mob members. The transformation of Michael portrayed by Al Pacino is the reason that this movie works. Michael starts out as a college kid with a girlfriend who wants nothing to do with the family business. He shows respect to his family, but declines interest in the illegal aspect of their business ventures. Once things start spiraling out of control, he proudly steps into any role they need him to fulfill, even if it means he has to leave the country for a few years. Once he returns, he continues to develop into a leader, with the calm contentions of his father and the intelligence and youth of a new generation, all the way until he replaces Vito as the Don of the Corleone family.Coppola uses doors as a symbol of the clear separation between the men's 'family business' and the women's family business. Whenever the men are about to discuss their ventures, they close the door to the outside world, both for security purposes and because they are the only ones who have the authority to make those decisions. While the men talk about that business, the women cook, clean, and tend to the younger children, clearly separated from the men's work, usually by a door.The biggest key to being an effective don in a mob is being respectful. In the meeting of the five families, Don Vito swears on his grandchildren's life that he will not break the peace they have decided upon, and hugs the don who had his son killed. Seeing those two men hug even after they had each other's sons killed clearly indicates that respect is something that is vital in this criminal underworld. One of the big moments in the movie is when Michael decides to do whatever is necessary for the family by agreeing to shoot Sollozzo in the diner. Michael changes his beliefs toward the family business in order to help his family. Later when their sister calls Sonny and says she's been beaten again, he rushes out the door without taking any bodyguards with him in order to protect and defend her. Later when the Corleone family is trying to buy the casino in Las Vegas, they ask Johnny Fontane to sign a contract to help their business, and he signs it without a second thought, because they are like family. Seeing these acts of family loyalty makes it clear that family is the one thing that people of this time believe in above all else.One of the best things about the Godfather is since it was an ensemble movie with many stars and lead characters, there is a constant fear for the characters safety. In some movies, there are only one or two main characters, so you know that they aren't in any harm or real danger until the end of the movie, and even then rarely. In The Godfather, several of the Corleone family members, rival members, and family friends die throughout the movie, even some of the big stars. Don Vito gets shot, survives, and then suffers a fatal heart attack later. Sonny gets gunned down in the street by a rival family. A supposed family friend, Sal Tessio, tried to set up Michael in a deal with the Barzini family, and they kill him. Seeing important named characters die throughout the movie makes it seem more realistic and more fearful of any dangerous situation they talk about.The biggest underlying struggle throughout the entire film is corruption versus loyalty and trying to make the best choices for the long term that will benefit you and that you can be at peace with. Corruption of loyalties, business matters, and family is rampant throughout the film. Sal Tessio gets paid by Barzini to try and get Michael killed. Carlo, Corinne's husband, baited Sonny into the open so Barzini's men could gun him down. Even the Corleones are guilty of using corruption to their advantage: They murder and mutilate the prized horse of a filmmaker so Johnny Fontane can get a part in a movie. The internal struggle of each character trying to stay devoted to their family while staying on top in the business is enticing to be a part of for a few hours.",10,1,3,30 September 2012
