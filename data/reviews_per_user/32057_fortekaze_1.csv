Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Amazing
","This movie had me engrossed in its story. The way it unfolded and its twists and turns intrigued me to watch on. The ending was probably the best part out of the entire movie. I think this is a significant improvement to the first movie with the characters and plot. The main villain this time was much more menacing. The plot this time, though confusing, leads you on a merry chase that will leave you intrigued and wanting more. By the end of the movie, you feel as if you have gone a journey in them. I found it especially fun trying to find out who was behind everything. All in all, this is probably one of the best action movies of 2011.",10,2,13,16 December 2011
