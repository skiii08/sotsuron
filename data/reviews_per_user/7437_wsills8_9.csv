Men in Black 3," Best of all 3
","Going into this film, I was unsure what I thought about it. I enjoyed the first film, yet didn't care much for the sequel. I was also unsure about Josh Brolin. Normally, he's a great actor, but when it comes to adapting a character from a book, Brolin's got a pretty bad track record *cough-Jonah Hex-cough*. The thing it did have going for it was that the trailers for this one looked good and Brolin looked pretty impressive, not to mention Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones. It didn't disappoint. The first 5 to maybe 15 minuets of the film start off slow and boring. At that point, I was hoping it would at least be as good as MIB II. Boy was it. Not only was it better than II, but it was better than the original itself. Josh Brolin plays a young Agent K to total perfection, and Will Smith turns in his best performance since I Am Legend and The Pursuit of Happiness. The main villain of this film also truly feels like a good villain, better than the original two probably combined. The story is good, the acting is great, and this film delivers quite a twist. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes Sci-Fi films and wants a fun film. An easy 7/10 which, if I could, in my books is a 7.7/10.",6,1,3,26 May 2012
The Expendables 2," Who would have thought.....
","That The Expendables 2 is one of the most fun films of the year. The action is, as you would guess, pretty darn good. The one liners are very funny as well as the movie references to Die Hard, The Terminator, and Rambo. The film definitely is a strong improvement upon the original and a great end of summer flick. Liam Hemsworth, honestly, steals the show and Van Damme makes a great villain. Willis, Stallone, Schwarzenegger, and Statham are all good in the film (not acting wise but action and humor). Chuck Noris provides comedy relief of an almost self parody of himself. Is this a film that's gonna take home Best Picture at the Oscars next year? Absolutely Not!!! But is it a fun film with funny one liners and an Avengers team of action stars. I give it an A and an 8/10.",7,2,9,18 August 2012
World War Z," Down in the hole, World War Z hits a double off the wall, just shy of a home run
","Despite problems surrounding the film previous to it's release, World War Z, lead by Brad Pitt, became a box office hit and was met with positive reviews from critics. This film definitely deserved them. This film had very good action, a good plot, and very good cast. Brad Pitt returns to stellar form after the mediocre Killing Them Softly. Also David Morse and the rest of the main cast provided good performances. The CGI was pretty good, but there has been better CGI done in other films without a doubt. The score by Marco Beltrami was very good as it had the same feeling as Hans Zimmer's did in Inception. All of the characters had very good chemistry with one another and felt very realistic. Even with all the good in the film, there were also negatives I took away from it. At times the plot feels slightly predictable as I pretty much predicted the entire last 10 minuets of the movie. Also, even though most of the characters were very realistic, they are not given much of a background or much substance except for a few of the characters which obviously involves Brad Pitt's. in the end, I feel that World War Z was a very good movie that fell just short of being great. I give it a 7.5/10 and a B+. I would recommend this to action buffs, zombie fans, and just about Nyone who wants a fun summer action flick with a good story",7,0,3,5 July 2013
21 Jump Street," Best Buddy Cop Movie Since Lethal Weapon
","21 Jump Street is a theatrical release based on the 80s TV show with the same name even though the film has almost nothing to do with the show. However, that doesn't stop the film from being a great popcorn flick of 2012. First of all, Channing Tatum gives by far his best performance as Jenko, one of the two main characters. Also, Jonah Hill gives one of his best performances as Jenko's partner, Schmidt. Also, Rob Riggle, Ice Cube, and Brie Larson give good performances also. Hill and Tatum share great chemistry and you buy and feel their friendship through the entirety of the film. This is also one of the funniest films that may have ever seen. The movie plays crude humor and plays it well. Most films that try this either over due it or under do it, but not 21 Jump Street. Also, the action is very good. Overall, this is a great comedy, a great buddy cop movie, and a great parody (of Buddy Cop films) all in one. This is by far the funniest film of 2012. I give it an 8.2/10",8,0,0,29 June 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," The Amazing Spider-Man is the new Batman Begins
","The Original Spider-Man Trilogy ended the same way as the original Batman series did, sort of. Both started off strong (Spider-Man 1&2 and Batman 1&2) and both ended with a bang, and not in the good way (Spider-Man 3 and Batman 3&4). Then, both got reboots. Batman's reboot entitled Batman Begins was a critical and box office success which set up one of the greatest films of all time entitled The Dark Knight which gets its sequel, The Dark Knight Rises, this summer. Spider-Man's reboot has so far closed the deal on at least 2 more films, and in my opinion, Marvel's version of Christopher Nolan's Batman series. The Amazing Spider-Man, just like Batman Begins, used Drama to a great effect and showed the more humane sides of both Peter Parker and Bruce Wayne. Just like Christian Bale did with Batman, Andrew Garfield delivers a great performance as Spider-Man, maybe even better than Tobey Maguire's version. The Acting was very good with Sally Field, Rhys Ifans, Emma Stone, and Martin Sheen all giving wonderful performances as Aunt May, The Lizzard, Gwen Stacy, and Uncle Ben, respectfully. Garfield and Stone share great chemistry on screen and Ifans gives a great performance which ranks him up there with Alfred Molina as one of the best comic book villains portrayed on the big screen ever. The story was very good as was the action and drama. The film definitely sets up a sequel and who knows what could happen. One of my favorite comic book films of all time and a MUST watch. I give it an A+ and a 9/10.",9,4,9,3 July 2012
Dark Shadows," Surprisingly Good; Worth the Admission
","Dark Shadows is unlike the many strange and different Tim Burton films that have come across in past years from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Alice in Wonderland. This film had a great story with very good acting from Johnny Depp, Chloe Grace Mortez, Michelle Pfiffer, and Jackie Earl Haley. Haley and Depp were hilarious, while Pfiffer and Eva Green provided the film a backbone. Even though this film may seem strange from the posters and trailers, it truly isn't when seeing the movie due to the story explaining the odd elements of the film. In fact, the only strange part of the film was the always strange Helena Bonham Carter, who actually was decent in this film. This film has some decent scares and some good laughs along the way which makes this a more mature version of A Nightmare Before Christmas and a funnier and very more kid friendly version of Sweeney Todd. This is an easy 7.5 out of 10 and should be watched regardless of how strange it may appear.",7,1,2,31 May 2012
Prometheus," Regardless a prequel or re-make, it's still a great sci-fi flick
","I will start off by saying that I am a fan of the original Alien series (yes, even the AVP movies) and I was very much wanting this to be the prequel to the original Alien. I will get this out here early on, this is NOT a prequel to Alien, but yet a spin-off. After watching the film go look up the dictionary terms for both a prequel and spin-off and you'll know what I mean. Now, to get to the review. I believe that Prometheus is the finest Ridley Scott has put on screen since Gladiator. The visual effects and CGI are truly stunning. This film is beautiful to look at, even more so than Avatar. Also, the acting is nothing less than amazing. Michael Fassbender gives an Oscar-worthy performance as David, a cyborg, as does Noomi Rapace, Charlize Theron, and Idris Elba as Elizabeth Shaw, Maredith Vickers, and Janek, respectfully. Truly, though, actors are nothing without a screenplay which this film displays almost effortlessly. Was Prometheus better than Alien? No, very few films have ever been, but is Prometheus a great tale with a surprising twist at the end? You bet. Prometheus is a great Sci-fi with a few good scares and great action sequences. Overall, I give Prometheus an 8.2/10 and an A. Definitely one of the best films of the year so far.",8,2,13,28 June 2012
The Wolverine," One of the Best X-Men Movies to Date
","The Wolverine is Fox's 2012 superhero attempt to bring in success, much like 2011's X-Men: First Class. Unlike every other X-Men film to date, The Wolverine takes place entirely out of the U.S. with parts in Canada and the rest in Tokyo, Japan. Also unlike every other X-Men film to date, Wolverine is the only X-Man in this one as he battles a evil Tokyo family, Viper, and The Silver Samurai. This film definitely takes risks, but unlike Wolverine's last solo film, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the risks pay off big time. The script and story are both very believable and realistic apart from a few instances of predictability and some corny dialogue. Also, The acting is very good. This, in my opinion, is Hugh Jackman's finest outing playing the lone wolf Wolverine. Also, Tao Okamoto, Rila Fukushima, and Svetlana Khodchenkova give very good performances. Other good performances come from Famke Janssen, Will Yun Lee, and Hal Yamanouchi. The story is filled with depth and darkness, and the action in this film never fails to amaze, especially the train fight. The cinematography is very good apart from some shaky camp, the production design is incredible as everything is gorgeous, the costume designs are very good as well, and the musical score by Marco Beltrami is very intense and epic, much like Hans Zimmer's for this year's Man of Steel. The direction by James Mangold was spot-on as he takes a deeper, darker, and more intense look into the lore of Wolverine as it is believable that he might actually die in the end. All in all, this is a very, VERY good movie and take on the Wolverine in a darker, grittier manner with very good acting from Hugh Jackman and the crew and impressive action.My Grade = A (8.7/10)Also, stick around for the credits as you will be pleased with one of the best after-the-credits scenes in a long while.",7,4,10,27 July 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," The Greatest Movie.......EVER!!!
","No joke, this film is better than The Dark Knight. First of all, the cast is amazing. Christian Bale and Tom Hardy give Oscar worthy performances as Batman and Bane, respectfully, as well as very good performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Anne Hathaway, Morgan freeman, Gary Oldman, and Marion Cotillard. The visual effects are stunning and the musical score is the best that I think I have ever heard. The story is by far the greatest which includes some of the greatest twists I have ever seen. Some people have a problem with the run time, but honestly, It was a perfect runtime, much like The Avengers' was. This is by far the best film of 2012 and in my opinion was the greatest of all time.",10,5,11,20 July 2012
