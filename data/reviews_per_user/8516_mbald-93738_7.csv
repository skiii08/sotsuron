Blade Runner 2049," The Reasons Movies Exist
","Growing up in an era of Sequel/Re-Boot/ and dumb action block-busters, I was somewhat nervous going into 2049. Thinking that it was going to be some action packed-explosion block buster with out the same themes or filming of the Ridley Scott classic 30 years prior. However, with the director of my favorite movie of 2013, Prisoners, Cinematographer Roger Deakins, and with Ryan Gosling after choosing some of the best scripts in recent years as the lead role, I was somewhat hopeful for this movie,....and after walking out of the theater....., I realized I did not just watch something, I just had an experience. Denis Villenuve has made one of the greatest looking movies ever made, and delivered a better character and plot driven story that expanded upon the themes of the last movie, if you feel the same way I do about this, then please tell everyone you know to go and buy a copy of this movie, due to the fact practically no one watched it in theaters. Because we NEED MORE FILMS LIKE THIS ONE.",10,2,13,17 April 2018
Captain Marvel," Well..., better than Black Panther
","Pros- Goose the cat was amazing, CGI Nick Fury and Colson was finominal (Take note Rouge One), Brie Larson tried.
Cons- everything else, the biggest problems with the film is mostly due to the fact that it feels like it's trying to be multiple stories at once. Is it a fish outta water? Buddy cop? Nostalgia trip? Space adventure? It feels like a cobination of all those things that could have worked but unfortunately comes across very bland and almost like pure filler. For me personally it was just kind of hard to connect with anything going on in Captain Marvel.

Gone Baby Gone," The movie David Fincher should gone for instead of Benjamin Button
","If there any praise to give this movie it is of course to the amazing cast. Probably the scene-stealer though is the actress Amy Ryan, who is a complete 180 from her performance in The Office. However, this film does have several issues in its screenplay, mostly on it's over all message, or better yet how it concludes. No spoilers but the central theme of this film is child endangerment and what is best for children, and for me I feel as if that question was really ever answered, almost feeling something unsatisfactory in the ending. Over-all I would say the film was pretty descent but just a couple little irritation kept this from a great film to just an okay one.",6,0,1,27 February 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," CAN, ANYBODY!..... Tell me why so many critics slammed this?
","Just watched this for the first time last night with many different viewpoints told to me going in, from and epic masterpiece to basic 'no one to star' formula shlock. but after the long awaited viewing I must ask: Why all the hate. Granted there where some historical aspects of the film that it could have benefited from, such as Freddie's famous use of cursing to the crowds in concerts, and the fact the band never split up and reunited at the Live-AID Concert. The fact that history in some movies has somewhat artistic license behind it is okay but the fact the movie does this alot can add to a lot of frustrations to some viewer, a.k.a. critics. However, I don't understand the bashing of its historical inaccuracies when films such as The Social Network get praised beyond belief and has ton of events that never happened in real life. So note to critics, learn double standards. If there was anything truly negative to say about the movie is that at the beginning the Freddie meets the members and his future, 'wife', does feel extremely rushed and not thought out well, however it is saved by AMAZING performances by the ensemble and Rami Malek (who is the scene stealer every second he's in). Overall it was a fair look into the life of arguably the world's greatest musical artist(s) of all time.

Joker," All it takes is one bad day...
","Ever since its debut at the Venice Film Festival, 'Joker' has been considered a modern masterpiece by many people who watched it. Many were calling it a mixture of 'Taxi Driver' and 'The King of Comedy,' which are both movies created by filmmaker Martin Scorsese. They were also giving a lot of praise to its lead, Joaquin Phoenix, saying it's possibly one of the most unsettling performances given by an actor in years. With all of these thoughts in mind entering the theater, I had some high hopes. I walked out with my expectations not met but surpassed.This movie is marvelous. When it comes to films and the way they tell stories, this is everything a film lover could hope for. Phoenix is mesmerizing in the role of Arthur Fleck, a very troubled man who is struggling to make sense of his life that eventually leads him to a path of crime. Though his character is awkward in his social interactions and time spent by himself, you can't help but feel sorry for this man who's just being beaten down by society every day. There is an Oscar buzz going around for his performance and it's totally warranted. Phoenix consumes the screen whenever he's on it, which is luckily the entire movieSince this film was based on the legendary comic book villain a lot of people were hoping for the moment Arthur Fleck transforms into the Joker to be a great feeling, but it wasn't a change the audience wants to root for. The filmmakers wisely made the decision to make the character not necessarily likable but understandable. One can understand why the Joker makes the decisions he does but the film doesn't glorify his decisions. When one watches his character arch throughout the movie, there is a sense of dread because you don't really want him to break mentally. This decision, however, makes this an excellent character study and cautionary tale.The other great aspect of the film is its pacing. This is definitely a slow-burning movie but it's never boring. Watching Arthur Fleck from where he was in the beginning to where he ends up is a complete 180 transformation.Throughout the movie, one can tell this man is just like a ticking time bomb, and when the boom explodes, no one will be safe.Todd Phillips, the director, also deserves a lot of praise. This is an amazingly shot and told story. This is by far his best film to date and that was my biggest concern going in. If the Joker was going to get his own feature film, it needed to be a very character-driven movie. The fact that Phillips' most character-driven film prior to this was 'The Hangover' movies raised huge concerns. Not to disrespect that film, but it's not a high art film. However, Phillips has proven himself to be a director with amazing talent, and I can't wait to see his next project.Another amazing aspect is the cinematography. The color pallets and framing of this film really gets one into the tone of this depiction of Gotham City. Though this film has a dirty and cold exterior, it does have a solid heart at its core.As far as negatives go, I have only minor nitpicks. If anyone has seen the film 'Taxi Driver,' they will know that a lot of 'Joker' takes inspiration from that - at times a little too much. Sure, all stories borrow from other stories, and it's not to say that this movie isn't its own thing, but one can easily see that 'Joker' has a kind of blueprint layout of that movie. There is also a song choice toward the beginning of the third act that I felt was a little cheesy. It was kind of a bigger moment in his transformation and it took me out of the moment a little.Other than that, this is a solid film with a relevant message in today's day and age. It can make one think of the thoughts going on in individuals one sits next to in class, walks past on the street, or sees eating in a restaurant. Who knows, all it takes is one bad day.",10,1,1,11 October 2019
It Chapter Two," 'IT' happens...
","Just got out of the theatre after seeing IT Chapter 2. This movie unfortunately felt a lot like the book, which if anyone's heard anything about the book, they know some things work and some things don't.There are numerous scenes that would have elevated the film if there was no jump scares or have scary scenes be immediately followed by a zinger by adult Richie.The tone in the first one felt a little disjointed at times but it over all had one tone: spooky. I can't really say the same for this film.That's not to say this movie is a huge disappointment, the cast is excellent across the board, especially Bill Skarsgaurd, who was great as usual. There's one scene in paticular that I personally think was more intense than the Georgie scene in the first one (really well done). However, this scene can't carry the amount of okayness in this film.There's a running gag in the film that involves adult Bill and how he's a writer, one of his books was apparently great until the end. If you look at both IT 1 and 2, the ending was the worst part.",6,2,5,6 September 2019
Black Panther," Politics, politics, and more politics...
","The only reason this movie gets so much praise is do to its cast. If you disregard the fact this is the 'first African American' superhero film (even though Blade has four films), this movie is mediocre schlock with yet another MCU villain with great potential but no follow through. The film does have some pretty epic fight scenes such as the fight in the Asian Club but other than a couple of cool choreographed scenes, this movie has nothing special to it.",6,5,11,6 December 2018
