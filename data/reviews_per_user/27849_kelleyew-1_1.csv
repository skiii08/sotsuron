Mission: Impossible III," Wow-E-Wow!
","I am a mom who saw this movie on Mother's Day. It left me breathless at many moments in the movie. I loved the action, actors and everything in between. Great movie!!! Could watch it over and over! It is better than the first two and that is so hard to do in trilogy! I gasped several times during the movie. I won't give you spoilers or even hints. Just keep in mind that it's Hollywood and have fun with this movie. I will say this, even if you hate Tom Cruise and his new 'life', his acting is still fantastic! Go see it for Ving Rhimes or Phillip Hoffman. Both are excellent in the film! GREAT cast! Let me just say, I know my husband would love this movie, so when the time came, we rented it and he watched it 3x in one night. Watched it the 4th and 5th time 3 days later. It is a great action movie. WATCH IT!",10,0,2,3 November 2006
