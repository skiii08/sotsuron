The Equalizer," Denzel Washington knows what he is doing
","I saw ' The Equalizer ' starring the immensely smart Denzel Washington as the protagonist. He plays this shrewd man called Robert McGall who stays away from what he does best until a day arrives when he comes across a situation which forces him to expose his 'other' side. And then all hell breaks loose. And thereafter, the movie's entertainment quotient increases by leaps and bounds.Denzel Washington exudes this chic persona in almost every movie starring him. He does the same for this movie and the result is for you to see. And the bad guys are just as awesome. The man who plays their head seems to be the perfect fit for a heartless villain, ready to pounce on his adversary at the first given opportunity.Antoine Fuqua is a lovely director. He had directed Denzel in the super-awesome ' Training Day ' and their second collaboration has done wonders again. The city of Boston has been shown in all its grandeur. Buy yourself a plate of nachos and sit back and enjoy watching Denzel wreak havoc. I'm sure you are gonna love this movie.",8,2,5,22 November 2014
John Wick," Keanu Reeves has starred in a good movie after a long time
","Keanu Reeves is back in form as ' John Wick ' and how. Keanu must have been waiting for a long time to play a role like this. Both John Wick's wife and the dog she had gifted him, get killed and he sets out to avenge their deaths. The movie is approximately an hour and a half long and comprises of some insane action sequences coupled with some amazing background music. And Keanu justifies playing a role like this all the more because his name is synonymous with ' The Matrix Trilogy' and 'Speed'. Ever since the Matrix movies released I've always wanted Keanu to play meaningful action-oriented roles. Unfortunately he hadn't managed to bag such roles until he signed for this movie.Keanu's looks in this movie have been planned in accordance with the nature of his character and the trying times his character is shown to be going through.Also, another plus point of this movie is that the villains look menacing. In an 'out-an-out' action thriller like this, it's imperative that the villains look their parts and each and every one of them have played their parts to perfection. Willem Dafoe does a fantastic job as Marcus.So Keanu Reeves has been a part of a good movie after a long hiatus. Whch is why people should go to the nearest theater and watch this movie as soon as possible.",8,10,24,15 November 2014
Fury," 'Fury' is one of the best World War movies I've seen in recent times
","'Fury' is one of the best World War movies I've seen in recent times. And I feel most of the credits should be given to the director of photography, the team behind the movie's splendid special effects and the movie's sound design department. The war sequences have been captured in a jaw-dropping manner and the consequent sounds that would reverberate across the theater every time a bomb would be dropped or a shot would be fired from a gun or a tank were enough to transport the audience to the 'other side' of the screen right amidst all the action. This movie didn't exactly need a superstar to carry it on his shoulders. However Brad Pitt's stardom is like the icing on the cake. A lot of people including me, came to watch the movie just because his name was associated with the movie. Little did I expect that there was so much more to this movie than just Brad Pitt. Having said that, Brad Pitt as an actor in this movie, has done a marvelous job. He plays Wardaddy and his job is to command the Sherman tank named 'Fury' well behind enemy lines so that he can annihilate as many German soldiers as possible . He is this adamant guy who is hell-bent on winning the war for his country.The actors who play the other 4 soldiers in the tank have done a commendable job in assisting Pitt's character every now and then. But amongst the 4 of them, actor Logan Lerman shines the most. With this movie he has taken his acting to a whole new level.The movie keeps you engaged from the very first scene right until the end. Please do not watch this movie for the sake of Brad Pitt. Watch this movie for its cinematography. So go to the movie theater, sit back and be assured that you will be taken on a journey back in time to April 1945.",9,3,8,7 November 2014
Interstellar," Yet another masterpiece from Christopher Nolan
","Watching any Christopher Nolan movie is the experience of a lifetime and Interstellar is no different. Nolan has this innate ability to transform his visions into spell-binding cinema and a movie like 'Interstellar' will make you want to know more about the beauty of the quantum theory. The film starts off on a very promising note and by the time the movie ends, it will knock you off your feet. That's obvious. It's a Christopher Nolan movie after all. There are various moments in this movie during which you might actually want to stand up on your seat and start clapping ( I'm not going to mention which scenes). In terms of scale and grandeur this movie seemed to be a notch better than Nolan's other movies.'Interstellar' has a magnificent star cast and Matthew McConnaughey, who plays Cooper in this movie, is on a roll. He won an Oscar for his performance in 'Dallas Buyers Club' earlier this year and he also did a marvelous job in 'True Detective'. Considering how he has acted in 'Interstellar', he is on the verge of winning an Oscar all over again. All the other actors and all the actresses have given lovely performances but this movie is like a gift from Christopher Nolan to Matthew McConnaughey. He overshadows almost every actor in this movie in terms of performance. His chemistry with his on-screen daughter Murph played by Mackenzie Foy, is adorable. The background score has been composed by the legendary Hans Zimmer and this movie might not have been as good as it is had it not been for his music. He is bound to be awarded for the kind of work he has done for this movie.Christopher Nolan has a tremendous eye for detail and you will notice this when you see the movie. To call Nolan a 'genius' director would be an understatement. He is God's gift to mankind. And as long as this man stays on Earth, I'm sure he will be responsible for many more extravaganzas in the years to come.",10,3,8,8 November 2014
Nightcrawler," In terms of performance, Jake Gyllenhaal has outdone himself
","'Nightcrawler' is the story of a stubborn underdog whose sole aim in life is to succeed no matter what. Our hero, Lou, is a thief by profession until one fateful day when he stumbles upon a car crash scene. Events lead to him choosing a career in 'crime-reporting'. Whether he manages to reach the pinnacle of success or nosedive towards oblivion forms the rest of the story.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Lou in this movie and he has outdone himself in terms of performance. He plays this self-centered, adamant human-being who is hungry for success, with tremendous Ã©lan. He carries the entire movie on his shoulders and the result is a masterpiece.The movie is pretty lucid and is bound to keep the audience on the edges of their seats. As far as I am concerned, I'm gonna resume playing Grand Theft Auto after seeing this movie. Hats off to the director!!!",9,1,4,9 November 2014
Baby Driver," Edgar Wright has reinvented himself with this marvelous piece of work
","I saw Baby Driver last night and I can assure you that my love for Edgar Wright has gone up a few notches. Edgar Wright never ceases to have fun with his experimental film-making technique. Until this film had released, he had made brilliantly funny films. So from that perspective, this movie is a slight departure from the kind of cinema we've been expecting from Mr. Wright. Baby Driver is in fact a relatively serious film but at the same time the elements of fun and excitement are not missing. Edgar Wright has skillfully concocted an interesting plot which is centered in the cut-throat world of robberies.The central character is that of a wheel man who is obsessed with music. The music assists him while he drives robbers to and away from the scenes of the crimes. You might have seen Ryan Gosling play a wheel man in the film Drive. What makes Baby Driver different from the Ryan Gosling film is that music plays a crucial role in this film. It complements Baby in more ways than one. I admired Baby's chutzpah and his daredevilry. The escape sequences are so beautifully choreographed that I thought I was sitting in front of a giant computer screen and playing an extremely sophisticated and realistic version of Grand Theft Auto. And all the action happens in Atlanta, United States of America. So I guess this is the first time Edgar Wright has made a feature film on American soil. He has also partnered with Sony instead of Universal.This movie is certainly one of the best heist films I've seen this year and Edgar Wright has reinvented himself by resorting to a story-line that is unlike the ones he has dealt with before. As far as the actors are concerned, everybody was great but I liked Jon Hamm's character the most. And the soundtrack of this film is a character in itself. Seldom has a robbery film felt so poetic. My ardent advice to you would be to watch this movie on the big screen as soon as possible. Make watching Baby Driver your utmost priority. It will liberate you in unimaginable ways",9,0,2,2 August 2017
Gone Girl," An immensely clever movie.
","I watched ' Gone Girl' yesterday. Its an immensely clever movie directed by David Fincher who is the genius behind the 1999 movie, ' Fight Club '. The movie stars Ben Affleck as Nick Dunne and Rosamund Pike as his wife Amy. Neil Patrick Harris plays Amy's ex-boyfriend Desi. Rosamund Pike portrays troubled Amy Dunne beautifully. This could possibly be her best performance till date. She actually manages to overshadow Ben Affleck's performance in this movie. Her main motive is to keep her husband on a tight leash and one needs to watch the entire movie to find out if she manages to do so or not . Neil Patrick Harris' performance as Desi in this movie is a complete departure from his usual comic roles. He manages to do a good job. Last but not the least, Ben Affleck's performance as Nick Dunne is mesmerizing to say the least. Nick Dunne isn't a faithful husband and he has a very very short temper and is extremely insecure. Which is why his wife plans to teach him the lesson of a life-time. The lady who plays Nick Dunne's sister has also done justice to her character. I have tremendous faith in David Fincher as a director. He has always made sensible movies and I'm sure he is going to make many more good movies like this one. :-)",9,0,6,3 November 2014
Get Out," 'Get Out' of your homes and watch the movie right now
","I just came back after watching this incredibly intelligent psychological thriller called Get Out. You could call it a horror film as the more generic elements that are seen in a horror film are present in this movie but this film is so much more than just a scary movie. Most of the scenes in this film are centered around the follow four actions (a) denial : Secrets are suppressed: (b) deceit : Secrets are revealed (c) submission : Secrets make the protagonist vulnerable (d) retaliation : Secrets make the protagonist strongDaniel Kaluuya, the lead actor, has played his role to stupendous perfection. I remember having seen him play Emily Blunt's FBI colleague in Sicario but that time my focus wasn't really on him so I had kind of missed out on appreciating the man's ingenious acting talent back then. This time though, we as an audience are transported into Daniel's mind and we, in a way, view the entire film from his character's confused perspective. Considering how he has conveyed certain emotions in this film, we might as well presume that he could be in the race for a Best Actor Oscar Nomination next year. Yes, he is that good.Can anybody who saw this film believe that this is Jordan Peele's debut film as a director ? If this is what his first film turns out to be, I am confident he will go on to become one of the greatest auteurs Hollywood has seen till date. I am so happy that this movie has minted so much money at the box-office. It deserves every penny it has earned. I have patiently waited for this film to release and now that I have seen the film, I can surely tell you that my patience has paid off. 'Get Out' of your homes and watch the movie right now",9,8,22,28 April 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A Film Adorned with Beautiful Animals and an equally Beautiful and Slightly Tedious Narrative
","I saw Star Wars : The Last Jedi at midnight on the 14th of December in NZ and I loved every moment of the film. I loved the way the layered characters of Luke Skywalker, Rey and Kylo Ren were examined, I loved how light was thrown on the internal politics that has been brewing up within the Resisitance and how that is impacting their capability to fight with the First Order, I loved the film's zest for adventure and I also loved the fact that this is one of the funniest Star Wars films I've seen. Also, I loved all the exotic creatures that this film has showcased. The Star Wars franchise could give the Fantastic Beasts franchise a run for their money any day when it comes to showing off a plethora of amazing otherwordly animals.And one of the things I loved the most about last night's screening was the enthusiasm of the people who came to see the film. I saw many people who came dressed in Star Wars attire. One person was dressed as Vader, then I'm sure I saw someone dressed up as a Jedi, I was wearing my Star Wars cap and a lot of people were wearing their Star Wars t-shirts. This is one of the advantages of watching a cult franchise's early screenings. You get to see the film the way it is meant to be seen. I just woke up from my sleep to type this status because after watching almost 24 hours worth of Star wars films I was deprived of some good sleep. So I came back from the theatre and slept like there was no tomorrow and I think I saw Luke Skywalker in my dreams. May the Force be with me",9,1,14,14 December 2017
Sicario," Sicario is a brilliant movie with extraordinary cinematography, amazing acting, a fantastic storyline and some impressive set pieces
","Sicario is a brilliant movie with extraordinary cinematography, amazing acting, a fantastic storyline and some impressive set pieces. The aerial shots were just so good especially the ones that showed the convoy of cop-cars moving on the roads in Mexico. The director succeeds in building up the tension needed to fuel a thriller like Sicario. The horror unfolds as the plot thickens and this is why I would like to laud the director, Dennis Villeneuve. His movie will make the audience cringe and keep them entertained at the same time. Very few directors can actually pull this off. He did something similar with Prisoners. But whereas Prisoner's ending was ambiguous and mind-bending, Sicario's ending is extremely idealistic. The ending could have been a lot more brutal but I guess it's absolutely fine because the movie, as a whole, is really enjoyable. Emily Blunt's acting cannot be described in words. She is intense and the audience sees the movie from her character's perspective. She was brilliant as Rita Vratasky in Edge of Tomorrow and she is just as good in Sicario. She plays Kate Macer in this movie. Benicio Del Toro has hardly ever failed to disappoint. He plays the title role in this movie. Sicario means hit-man in Mexico. Benicio Del Toro plays the hit-man with unparalleled swagger and the right amount of shadiness. Josh Brolin plays a shameless cop and he does a great job. All in all, Sicario is a fantastic movie and worth every penny you spend for watching it.",9,3,8,29 September 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," This film is unabashedly funny
","I saw Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 last night on the Xtreme screen at Hoyts Riccarton and I was utterly pleased with the work James Gunn has done for this film. There is no dearth of unapologetic humor in this film and after a certain point of time even the strong speakers of the cinema hall could not douse one of my friends' maniacal laughter. I was personally vouching for the more serious moments in the film because that's when I could clearly hear what the characters were saying. Otherwise when there was even the slightest hint of comedy, this guy (my friend) used to start laughing like the most hysterically loud hyena that has ever walked on this planet.In this film we get a better insight into the complexities of Star- Lord's dad and realize that he is not exactly what he seems to be. We also get a better idea of Yondu's character. I wish Marvel made a spin-off film that intricately depicted the culture and traditions of the Ravagers. They are such an exquisite group of space -pirates. I also felt sorry for Nebula and I wish the Avengers manage to conquer Thanos as fast as possible although knowing how powerful Thanos is, it will take quite sometime to bring Thanos down.We get to see Stan Lee in this film, not once, but two times. And the Marvel tradition of having post-credits scenes is maintained in this film. There are a plethora of post-credits scenes and I am eager to find out how significant Sylvester Stallone's character turns out to be in the future editions of the Marvel films. It would be awesome to see Doctor Strange and the Avengers team up with the Guardians to fight their most important battle . We got amazing seats for this film. We were seated at the center of the hall and I felt I was right amidst all the action that was happening on the screen. I'll try to seat myself at the center for all the future Marvel viewings.

The Disaster Artist," How to be Shameless and Get What You Want
","Guys, I just came back after watching what could possibly be one of the funniest films of 2017. If you have unrealistic dreams and don't have the talent to realize them just watch this film. This man called Tommy Wiseau didn't know how to act, didn't have an attractive personality and yet he went ahead and produced, directed and acted in this film called 'The Room' which is considered to be one of the world's greatest bad films ever made. Tommy was or maybe still is an adamant, passive-aggressive human-being who wanted to continue to be an unprofessional and bad actor/director because there was this strong sense of entitlement that was embedded within him which told him NOT TO CHANGE. And look at the awesome things that have happened to him in his life. James Franco has directed this film and stars as Tommy in the film. James and his brother have acted brilliantly but it is very important to take a leaf out of Tommy's book. If you suck at something, keep sucking at it until such time somebody considers your sucking to be some extraordinary form of talent. One of the best dialogues from this film is something like this: 'Your worst day as an actor on sets is better than your best days anywhere else '. Leave everything and watch this movie right NOW. I'll give this movie a thunderous 10 OUT OF 10",10,1,4,10 December 2017
American Made," Doug Liam and Tom Cruise make such a great pair
","Very few directors have tapped the clown in Tom Cruise the way Doug Liman has. He had directed Tom in Edge of Tomorrow which was humorous and was set amidst a post-apocalyptic alien invasion. American Made is just as humorous and is also set amidst an invasion of sorts except this movie is a true story. Captain Barry Seal had the adventure of a lifetime before falling prey to a monster of his own doing. But what an adventure it might have been for this man to smuggle contraband into and out of the States.I felt Tom Cruise did a great job portraying the pilot in an extremely light-hearted and funny way. Cruise is known for playing roles that ooze oodles of dare-devilry. But most of those roles are of fictitious characters. For once Tom plays a real man whose daring knew no bounds. Captain Barry Seal was like a real-life Ethan Hunt. Hence I feel casting Cruise as Seal was an extremely appropriate decision and should help in filling Universal Studios Entertainment's coffers.If you were awed after seeing the aerial sequences in Dunkirk, wait until you have seen this film. The planes are subjected to go through some intense acrobatics which will please you. If you were disappointed with Cruise after watching The Mummy, I can assure you that you will heave a sigh of relief after watching this film. The film's story is not only engaging but also witty and hilarious. There are hardly any stagnant moments so the probability of you getting bored is very low.A very ironic thing about American Made is that in 1986 when Barry Seal must have gone through whatever turmoil he did, a young Tom Cruise played a pilot in Top Gun which released that year. Did he know he would pay a real-life pilot who was very relevant during those days almost 31 years later ?Watch American Made . Don't watch it for Tom Cruise's stardom. Watch it because you deserve to watch an entertaining and great film on the big screen that coincidentally has a superstar playing the leading man. I humbly apologize for the length of this post but sometimes I just can't control myself from pouring my thoughts out",9,180,233,24 August 2017
Parasite," Vulnerability is inevitable and everybody is dispensable.
","Saw 'Parasite' yet again and was once again entranced by the movie's brutal depiction of the ramifications of being vulnerable. But vulnerability is inevitable and everybody is dispensable. 'Parasite' is an allegorical masterpiece and is certainly worth all the hype it has generated over the last few months. I'd highly recommend everyone to see this film and if possible, even sample the Black & White cut of the film. I haven't seen the B&W cut myself but the director says the societal fractures that are depicted in the film are even more evident in the B&W cut. Kudos to Bong-Joon Ho and his team for conjuring up this splendidly bitter tonic. If you have seen and loved 'Parasite', watch Jordan Peele's 'Us'.",9,1,5,28 February 2020
Deadpool," Deadpool is perhaps the most shameless, unpretentious and blunt superhero I've seen off late :-)
","So the movie starts and the crew members are introduced or rather described. I start laughing. And the rest is history........... I had to collect myself once the movie got over. Why did I have to collect myself once the movie got over ? Well, I was in splits and the mind was blown !!!!!!!!! You would find pieces of me everywhere in the theatre. I never wanted this movie to get over. The only bad thing about this movie is that it gets over ( and the fact that the protagonist is diagnosed with cancer). Otherwise, there is only heavenly awesomeness in every scene. Pristine heavenly awesomeness. Deadpool is perhaps the most shameless, unpretentious and blunt superhero I've seen off late. His jokes are audacious and alarmingly beautiful, his reflexes are the stuff of legends and if you are in his bad books you'll be scared of his jabs. He is a mutant you see. And his alter ego, Wade Wilson has an intense sex drive which is satisfied in possibly some of the raunchiest and innovative ways there could be. So when Mr. Wilson gets diagnosed with a terminal disease all hell breaks loose because he is kind of insecure that a zillion nice things would get compromised.I am not going to make this review unnecessarily long. All I can say is Ryan Reynolds has more than made up for his Green Lantern stint by playing Deadpool. His character is the sole reason why anyone should watch this movie. Deadpool isn't just a bad ass. He is a bad ass with a good ass.",9,4,13,12 February 2016
The Martian," Ridley Scott and Matt Damon have collaborated together for what could possibly be their best movie in a long time.
","Ridley Scott and Matt Damon have collaborated together for what could possibly be their best movie in a long time. The Martian has moments that will sweep you off your feet and put you right beside Matt Damon's character who is stranded on Mars. What I love most about this movie is the way his character has been conceived. He knows he is screwed but he chooses to remain positive and ends up being extremely humorous. At 3 different times during the course of the movie he refers to himself as a Mars-colonialist, a space- pirate and Iron Man respectively and this justifies the fact that the man is trying his level best to instill within him a certain amount of confidence which in turn could enable him to remain alive and wait for NASA to rescue him. When NASA realizes that Mark Watney (played by Matt Damon) is alive, chaos ensues and NASA's attempts to contact Watney had me in splits. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jeff Daniels have acted pretty well.Jessica Chastain has and will always remain a good actress. At least I feel so. She plays an astronaut who feels guilty for having left Mark Watney on Mars during a fierce storm which had forced her and her colleagues to abandon the mission they were trying to accomplish. What's ironic is the fact that Ms. Chastain and Mr. Damon starred in Interstellar too. In that movie Damon had betrayed Chastain's father. In this movie Chastain is determined to rescue Damon from Mars. Ridley Scott has directed a movie which is not tremendously preachy, isn't overtly emotional and has doses of unexpected humour here and there. And it abounds in space technology that the protagonist dabbles with in order to survive. For all the above reasons this movie is going to be wildly successful. And when the movie finishes you will have your feet back on the ground with a THUD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",8,4,63,3 October 2015
