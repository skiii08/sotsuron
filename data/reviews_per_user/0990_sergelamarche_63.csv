Blade Runner 2049," Sensical continuation
",Very well done and well thought. A few twists as to where it was heading give it value. Not lyrical and ground breaking like the first was. Replicants are much too perfect. Their imperfections of bodies and mind made the first much more intriguing and unpredictable.,8,5,9,6 September 2018
Your Name.," Fantastic
","Great animation, great storyline. The space-time connection works wonderfully. And even the change in the time-line makes sense. The dream state that is and is not, the memory fades,... the whole thing is perfectly executed and works like precise clockwork. Excellent at all levels.",10,3,5,19 February 2018
10 Cloverfield Lane," Chills and frills that keeps us guessing
","Excellent acting and a story line that keeps us guessing about the true nature of the film. That fact was a little obvious after the second turn in the story, but it had more turns in store. Is this inspired by Silence of the lambs, zombies or The mist (S.King) all at once? It is less strange and more strange at the same time. It has lots of nice touches from horror classics (solubilizing victims, the Alien), to bits of lovely french references (which could be horror for the englishes). The story evolves and we are kept in the dark long enough to long for an answer, damn the consequences, like our heroine. Super good special effects with the aliens invadors. Flaws though: how can the generator be working so long; how can the air be so well filtered; how can she throw up so high; how can alcohol be right there when you need it. Details that don't distract too much from the action, humoristic at times. Excellent film!",8,0,0,2 January 2018
Detroit," US historical event well recreated
","The story is compelling, scary, historical. It depicts very well the state of mind of the US. Violence is their way. They did not change much. Better than Alien, because true.",9,1,3,20 May 2018
Wind River," Good with issues
",The film has a complex story enough but... there are problems with it. The indigenous don't make too much sense. The blood killing people by drowning in the cold is nonsense. Many people's reactions in the film are too crazy even amongst psychopaths.,7,0,0,4 September 2018
Darkest Hour," History in film
","The best way to learn history. Pretty good film with famous moments showed. Everything is still too clean to feel real though, we feel we are in a studio most of the time.",6,0,2,4 June 2018
Passengers," Ã‰pic
",Great epic journey through the stars. the film evolve from a lonely experience in a luxury ship to an love adventure to a life and death situation. Great ship and special affects. A bit annoyed that Jim speaks spanish but no french.,8,1,2,4 March 2019
Orphan," scary leth...hum, little girl
","A bit comedic at the start, it goes into serial killer territory relatively quickly. Good new spin about a lethal gir...oh, little girl I mean. Not all that formulaic but it could have been better, and it will surely now that girls are the heroes.",7,0,0,26 February 2018
Juno," Some hilarious bits
",The girls were fun to watch and hilarious but the story is a bit off and I don't see this ending with these people the way it was played.,7,1,2,29 August 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Funny and over the top
",I thought the previous Thors sucked. But this one was not that dumb. Lots of funny bits with all the actors playing it for jokes. The films laughs at itself and beats Black Panther for it. Also glad of the ending!,8,2,5,13 December 2018
Cloverfield," Blair witch + Godzilla
",Totally Blair witch + Godzilla pumped up. Good acting and effects. Immersed in the crazy action. Not credible enough to be living the fear though. Haha!,7,0,0,13 May 2018
Molly's Game," Thrills, chills and even psychology
","This film is great, well cut, makes sense and a true adventure story. Fantastic story and very well played and produced. Wide awake during the whole thing.",9,4,7,11 December 2018
Moana," Superb with excessive cuteness
","Typical Disney but with superb animation, comedy, and an exotic story. Lots of songs though, and much too cute, which makes it probably very good for kids. The arts and animations are stunning.",8,1,2,19 March 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Superlative fake
","Plenty of good ideas and a story that is not too insane but, at some point too much powers just stop making any sense. A flexible suit that is fitted with a supercomputer that knows more than batman? Only the cute factor keep it afloat.",6,0,2,1 September 2018
Black Mass," Know the devil
","The film leaves a lot of blank spaces and concentrates only on the most memorable moments of the crime life of Bulger. It think it is mostly due to length. The film has a limited time. A whole miniserie could be dedicated to the more complete story of Bulger and the mafia take of Boston with more details. It will likely be done because there are lots of lessons in it. For what it is, this film gives plenty.",8,1,3,2 May 2018
Doctor Strange," Super hero fluff
",Sorry to say but this is lots of effects for fluff. It is getting too facile. It is funny enough and fun enough to watch the last half. Watchable.,6,1,1,11 July 2018
Interstellar," Epic
","Epic story spanning decades for some but mere hours for others. The story starts when the dust bowl has returned, just as it was. The relativity calculation for gravity is wrong though. If gravity was so strong to make minutes be years, they would be crushed on the surface. Same with the black hole. It would crush all and the whole universe life would have passed before he could come out. Still good effort for the rest of the physics laws.",7,0,0,22 January 2019

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Comedy, criminal comedy
","Things happens in this film that would not fly in the real world. It is a comedy of retaliations, with irony, full of the psychopaths of USA. Good laughs!",7,0,1,4 November 2018
The Lost City of Z," Problems but good story
","There are numerous issues not with the script but with the execution. Going to the source means going upstream, which they were not. And one horse appeared out of nowhere. Points are made about the englishes though, that resonates true, and the natives, that resonates true. The people seems not to care, but the history proves that people did not care much for life in these days. The englishes more than any others (except the germans).",8,1,2,3 May 2018
Fargo," What could go wrong
",This film is well threaded and not many flaws are showing. Colourful characters fill the story that goes from a bad idea to worse. Greed and psychopathy do not mix well. Spellbinding!,9,0,1,1 July 2018
The Italian Job," Good popcorn film
","A heist and a double-dare heist that is still holding up today, 15 years later. Charlize is looking fabulous as usual.",6,0,0,22 January 2019
Baby Driver," Cinephile chase and heist film
","Not much is credible in this film. We have to enter the crazy world of the film and ride with them. The chases are all great with almost physically possible stunts, and the actors are actually in the rides most of the times. Sinful fun.",8,2,3,17 June 2018
Justice League," Crazy
","The league of super heroes is there to bring back superman, basically. Good production funny at times and bizarre at times. This is getting crazier and crazier with always more and more power. I miss Star Trek with its themes.",6,1,9,10 February 2019
Armageddon," Spoofy
","Great special effects but not quite real. Oil drillers saving the planet in space in 18 days? This film is sucking up. Lots of funny moments though, like a spoof of the apollo program.",4,2,6,18 July 2018
Split," Crazy bum
","What is great in this is our split hero with the multiple personalities. He is believable. The girls however are not. Their role is to be almost defenseless. The split guy being out for hours at a time, there is no way they could not have escaped ten times.",7,1,3,2 March 2019
The Orphanage," Scary and creepy
",Good set up that is not going in the direction we think. This is not the pure girl that will be the victim of ghosts or monsters.... or is it?,7,0,2,26 December 2018
Dangal," Perfect epic biopic
",The story must have been tweeked some because it is plain perfection. The film and acting hit the right notes almost every time. The action is completely believable (I'm no wrestler expert though) and looks athletic thoughout. A plainly fabulous story full of challenges and accomplishments. Loved it!,9,0,0,18 May 2018
Dunkirk," A piece of history
","Nothing like a good film to make history alive. This one just tells three views but very well. The actions made more real with real planes, boats, water. The plane part is the best ever made to cinema. They stopped the story when they are to evacuate french soldiers.",9,1,3,1 July 2018
Get Out," Something is amiss... be worried
","Strange film where we can't guess what the hell is going on until it is too late. Original narrative where a group is acting a bit too nice while checking you out a bit too much. Nightmarish vulnerability. We think KKK involvement but no, or maybe?",8,7,14,17 April 2018
Room," not credible
","I didn't find this film all that realistic. If a mouse can find its way in, seems that a woman and a boy could have found their way out easily. It just didn't work for me. Escaping from bad parents though, that is hard. They keep bringing you back!",4,2,4,28 February 2018
Stardust," Great production, funny
","Magic once again, jeez. The production and effects are first grade, the acting superb, the story out of this world. It is a bit much but it is hilarious, ironic and absurd.",8,2,2,11 September 2018
Call Me by Your Name," Meh
",Chalamet is great but I didn't fall for it. I don't see how the boy could go after the girl and the man in the same day. Except if psychopathy is involved. I find the film rather disgusting like poo wrapped in bonbon paper.,5,4,14,22 February 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," More over the top sorceries
","At some point, the sorceries are only limited by imagination. They don't seem to take source anywhere sensical. Fun ride nevertheless. Depp can pay his debts.",6,1,1,10 June 2018
Hidden Figures," Obvious but unknown
",This film depicts three women that made it with brilliance amongst brilliant people. Intelligence is what beats all the stupid things people do. More of it would help all sides. Great film!,8,0,3,2 July 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Epic
","Pretty good slow chase story with heroes and cavalry coming for help. The life of mice. Luckily, some have the force. Great effects, good acting and rather funny at the beginning.",7,4,23,18 November 2018
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Fabulous as usual
","Encore une super aventure de Harry Potter. Celle-ci prépare le combat final contre Voldemort. Ce monde fantastique est toujours rempli de beauté, de surprises et d'intrigues.",8,0,0,1 April 2018
Into the Wild," Good story
","The film is well done but not sure I liked the non-linear treatment in this case. Chris seems to have been charming, challenging and plenty adventurous, possibly in reaction to his father abuses when he was a child (according to his sister book). Great recreations. Not sure the story would have so much resonnance if he had survived.",7,1,2,24 November 2018
Selma," Scorching
",Seems like a great recreation of the events that liberated the african-american vote in Alabama and elsewhere in the US.,10,0,0,24 June 2020
La La Land," Dreamy
","The film is very lovely up to the argument of breakup. Then after, it is kick ass and the dream come true does not stop more dreaming. Life can always be better.",8,1,2,15 September 2018
Super 8," Bad ET wants to go home
","Awesome Spielbergo production again. ET prisonner by military is set free and terrorise a small town. All he wanted was to phone home to get home somehow. Poor ET. Also, spoiler alert, he's carnivore.",9,0,0,10 May 2020
Snowden," Great lowdown
","How Snowden came to be one of the important whistle-blowers of the world. After Manning, which revealed crimes the US military did, Snowden chose to flee and stay free. This film holds a neat and simplified narrative that explains the work and the revelations. The fact that the US has secrets courts to obtain permissions so that no one is aware is a huge trampling of freedom. Frankly, how can they expect us to believe in their democratie if the public is never informed of the actions of their government.",8,1,1,4 March 2018
Beauty and the Beast," Still a great story
","Still a great story, same songs, fabulous production more into young adults and adults this time. The most evil that actually also changes in the story is the witch that casts the spell in the first place. She would have killed the whole castle!",8,0,1,1 May 2018
Sicario," Bloody smashing
","Denis Villeneuve knows how to make them real, tense and smart. Flaws are few but there are some. A SWAT girl not knowing enough about the drug war to not get upset, seems unlikely. Also not listening to their experienced parners seems a big no-no when bullets flies that often. A big boss not having more than 4 body guards, also not likely. As a documentary, no, but as a film, yes. Bravo!",8,1,2,12 February 2018
The Shape of Water," Funny fable
","Funny fable for adults about the unspeakable attraction for fishes. No, wait, a merman, made cute for our ladies.",7,0,3,28 November 2018
The Disaster Artist," Hilarious, strange
",It is something to think this film is based on a true story and they have the footage to prove it. Hilarious and strange like life itself sometimes.,7,0,0,23 August 2018
"Hail, Caesar!"," Somewhat funny, strange, and a cliff note
","A bit of a cliff note of the Hollywood heydays. A bit of everything. Big number on homer-sexuality with the navy. Hew! A cowboy cast into a soirée, a kidnapping, commies, etc. Not too bad.",6,0,0,14 March 2018
The Reader," German love
","Kate is so damn fabulous every time. This story uses the nazi germans as element of guilt in a sexual love story between a woman and a boy. This is the dream of many boys but frowned upon in these me too days. And Weinstein cie is involved! In any case, sensual, moral, thoughtful are the words for the film.",8,1,1,16 April 2018
Kong: Skull Island," Mash up of monsters
",This film is like a mash up of many other films. It is fun to watch and the CGI are great. The films flows well. Silly fun.,6,0,2,6 September 2018
Murder on the Orient Express," Well done
","This Agatha Christie is redone every generation. Great effects here, beautiful. Well done background story. I liked.",7,2,5,19 November 2018
Arrival," Language, time, simple
","Love the special effects! All super good. The story is rather simple, like most of ET movies in fact. Pretty good message but I would have enjoyed to see all the military being crushed. I'll refrain from telling the story because it is worth watching. It is well thought and I liked it. I disagree with many details and agree with many more. Hence, more better stories are to come. I can almost see them already. I know it and I will enjoy them nevertheless.",8,0,1,28 January 2018
Wonder Woman," Another superhero movie
",A bit of gender equalisation doesn't hurt. But this is so the same stuff at a different sauce. Feminine sauce. Yummy!,6,3,4,5 July 2018
Black Panther," Good production and beautiful
","Great CGI and decent acting. Beautiful. But the story is a mash up of many bits of wars as old as the greco-roman era, except maybe for the civil war bit. Too much magic powers just isn't making sense at some point. Suit and helmet that appear and disappear? All the rating goes to the beauty. Silly otherwise.",6,1,4,11 December 2018
Mother!," Insane
","From beauty, the film turns into an insane nightmare reminiscent of the english invasion of america, the civil war, the world wars, the sects, and satanism. Only the mother seems to have a heart. It's insane, but it mirrors a lot of the human insanity of psychopaths I would say.",6,0,0,9 March 2019
Life," Too alienesque
","The story is calque of Alien, only details are different. Good production and effects most of the time. Still, the laws of physics and biology are not obeyed. It's horror more than sci-fi.",6,1,3,23 September 2018
50_50," Good Seth up
",Intelligent story and film based on a true story. Seth Rogen is Seth Rogen and the comic anchor in the film as well as in the real life story. The real story was made more cinematic. Pretty good.,8,0,0,9 June 2018
Annihilation," ET comes
",New version of alien invasion. Or non-invasion. Good production. Beautiful. Somewhat creepy. Open ending.,7,1,3,25 November 2018
Jackie Brown," Good ride, not too bloody
","A Tarantino that is less comic book and almost romantic. Good acting, good action and a slow burn thrill that does not abate even after the end. Why? Because we know that stealing huge wad of mob money can't be good for long.",7,0,3,23 April 2018
Joy," A Joy to see
","Jennifer is sooo good looking. She gets to look a bit gritty, determined and kick ass also here. She's like this beautiful, sweet thing we don't take too seriously that then grabs you by surprise. The film is lightly made, hilarious at times, on a dramatic theme that goes up and down more and more until the climax. I loved it in spite of the bubble gum treatment.",8,7,16,24 March 2018
The Proposal," Better than your average formula
","In very large lines, it is a formula. But all the details are original and it is a Disney movie. Surprisingly hot for Disney in fact. Our heros were very daring. They're are both a catch. Genuine laughter, sweet moments, awkwards moments, adventure, panoramas, realistic in flight shots. This film is a great vehicle for a good time. Better than average.",7,0,0,14 February 2018
Sully," Best reenactment of crash and aftermath
","Very well done film. This is probably the best recreation of an accident I have ever seen and with the best outcome. Plane accidents rarely end up well at all and recreating them would be a downer. Alive comes to mind but it was survival story after the crash and does not end up well for most of them. Sully is basically the story of what can happen when the best of them comes together and are in the right place to do so. A great occasion to be bright and heroic. In the dvd extras, they mention the contrast with the market crash and the greed normally prevalent in NY city, causing it. There are people that do not just want to get filthy rich quickly or screw up other people or use the system.",8,1,1,21 January 2018
Alien: Covenant," Too stupid
",There is just too many stupid things done pretty early to make it enjoyable. The monster movie of aliens loses by having monsters with too much power and reproducing much too quickly. The humans are mostly dumb in this.,4,2,4,2 October 2018
Evil Dead II," A bit aged
","The film is so over the top gory and played ridiculously, it is a laugh. Past the mid point however, I found the joke being a bit too long for my taste. Got more annoying than funny.",4,0,4,9 January 2019
