The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Outstanding
","I really enjoyed this movie. Being a strong fan of the book series as well as the movies, I was highly impressed by the accuracy to Susan Collins version of the story. When I first herd this movie was going to be split into 2 separate movies, I was honestly concerned. But I feel like the Directors and Producers did a fantastic job of splitting the current story line in half, making the audience on edge to watch the next movie (sadly a year away). I found this movie made me feel various different emotions. From joyful, to hysterically sad, just like the book did. The outcome of this movie was fantastic. Well done to all the producers! I recommend to go and see this movie, as well as the first two, if you haven't.",10,23,64,21 November 2014
