Walk the Line," WHY doesn't Joaquin Phoenix have an Academy Award by now???
","EVERY film he has been in deserves an award, yet he is passed by.....The way he captured Johnny Cash in Walk The Line is enough of a reason to give this man an award for his awesome talent. Not to mention 'To Die For' and every other film he has been in. He has a way of becoming any character that suits and does it in a brilliant way. Why Tom Hanks, whom is a good actor in his own right, gets two awards in a row and Joaquin is totally ignored is beyond me.Of all actors in this day and age, the greatest is Joaquin. And he is Vegan. Loves animals and wont eat or exploit them. You cant find anything better in a human being. Vegan, by the way, is a person that wont eat, use or wear anything that comes from animals. We Vegans are rare, but a growing awakening to animal rights.",Null,1,4,16 October 2006
