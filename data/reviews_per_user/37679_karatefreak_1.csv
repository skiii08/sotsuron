The Ring," The best film of 2002
","I think that the ring is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen! I recommend this movie for any scary movie fan. I think that the Ring is better than Ringu. The scary images in the Ring are much more detailed and authentic. I give the Ring a 10 out of 10! The actors our great and the script is awesome! I recommend this movie for any scary movie fan or just a movie fan. I think you will love it like I do. The best movie of the year. Its the best horror, suspense, and dramatic film of 2002. The sequels in a movie are usually better but I say that the Ring is much better than the Ring twO. Many of the actors and images in the original Ring are more scary, detailed, and authentic than the second movie.",10,0,1,23 June 2005
