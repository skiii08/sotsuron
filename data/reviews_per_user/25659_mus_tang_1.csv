The Monuments Men," A six for the seven of you.
","I never had high hopes with the movie (although the movie had a great star cast) but it didn't even meet the expectation. Sure the movie had some great and impeccable dialogues and moments but it seemed to be inconsistent (the movie was lost somewhere in the middle).I mean the whole star cast gave us movies like Gravity, The Bourne Series, Groundhog Day, Notting Hill, Moonrise Kingdom and the list goes on. But this didn't looked like them. Mr. Goodman though did a good job. The movie had some of parts which really showed the horrors of WWII which were moving and there was a bit of light comedy. All in all an okay movie could watch it if you have nothing to do for the weekend (I would still suggest order a pizza and watch your favorite movie).",Null,1,2,23 February 2014
