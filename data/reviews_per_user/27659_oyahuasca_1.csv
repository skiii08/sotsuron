Requiem for a Dream," A movie to scare teenagers away from drugs.
","Honestly, I hated the movie. Yes, it was very shocking and unforgettable, but it was also very grimy and pessimistic. It's just not the type of movie that will leave you deep in thought or searching for a meaning. It was very visual and had great actors, but the story itself was awful. After it finished, I felt very sick and disappointed of the world. It is disgusting and the only way I will ever watch it again is when I scare my children away from drugs.Overall, if you're into films with degrading characters that gives you no hope into the future, this movie is perfect for you. I saw it once and will never watch it again.",1,9,19,17 January 2012
