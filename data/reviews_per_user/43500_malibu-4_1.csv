The Blair Witch Project," Intense... the boundaries of fear have been broken!
","OK, so the hype has just about driven you insane. You've heard about the Blair Witch enough to make you want to scream... no pun intended. Everyone is talking about it, everywhere you go you see something about it, and now you feel like you are somehow obligated to see it. Well, don't feel like you are being drugged into the situation. It's a hell of a ride, and you won't regret one single second of it.Here's the breakdown of the characters:Heather is an adventurous female who spawned the entire idea of going into the woods and creating a documentary on the elusive Blair Witch, who has supposedly haunted the Burkittsville woods for over a century. She is the person who films almost the entire movie. Some of the scenes of her are truly terrifying, and make everything seem sooo much more real. I won't tell you about it, but 'The Confession' scene makes you want to cry along with her! Mike is, put simply, a baby trapped in a 20 year old's body. All he does the entire length of the movie is complain and cuss, much like Heather. He CONSTANTLY finds a way to get on Heather's nerves. One in particular event(which I won't divulge) will make you want to kill him yourself.Josh... well... Josh is just Josh. He is pretty much an average dude. He is most definatly a key role in the movie. He always finds a way to make you laugh, but he'll scare you, too. OK, OK, so people are saying that the movie contains more humour and jibberish than it does shrieks. This movie is most definatly more psychological than it is scary. You have to think about it over and over, and it just gets scarier. The ending is quick and mind-lashing. Secrets are left to be turned up sooner or later... or never? All there is to say is SEE BLAIR WITCH! It's a movie that cleary you are going to have ONE OR TWO opinions on: It's unbelievably incredible or it totally sucked. Obviously you are going to have to be intelligent and witty to dabble into it's truths. It's a movie that you tend to be more involved with after it's over. Will you be taken in by the Blair Witch? Don't get to in over your head... no pun intened.",Null,1,2,6 August 1999
