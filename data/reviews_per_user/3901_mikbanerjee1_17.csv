Hereditary," Finally a refreshing addition in Horror Genre!
","Although we have a prominent supply of horror movies in Hollywood, only few of them turns out to be good. Sometimes much more surprising than the usual expectancy. Just like this one! The consistent creepiness and technical execution hooked me up throughout the whole movie. Though It has slow pacing and a lacklustre final act ; it was affective as a whole nonetheless! With some brilliant direction & screenplay and an abundance of powerful performances from all the lead actors made it even more better! Having said that, the climax disappointed me. With so much potential and promising first two acts ; I expected a lot more from it! Kind of wanted different ending.",8,1,5,28 June 2019
Us," Jordan Peele nailed it again!
","After Jordan Peele's 'Get Out', The expectations for the Next addition were as usual very high. And he didn't disappoint. To my frank opinion, this was a better movie overall than Get Out! Many people might not agree but I found this one to be more precise on the execution part! It started with a great note and continued with the same momentum till the end. The story is so engaging, with brilliant screenplay and background score! The performances were top notch, the characterisation unlike Get Out has been done brilliantly well! We actually care about the whole family's well being. That being said, it's not a fully flawless film. It had it's downfall on one part and that is the 'Explanation'.
The main concept, the main 'project' which have been shown in the film isn't really well explained or have much significance on a motivational perspective! Many questions arose in our mind that were not answered nor we could guess. And somehow I feel they should have gone with an 'open' ending rather than a general one. That way it could have been more interesting to the audience to argue about later. Overall a great film that you should watch but don't expect usual horror elements. It's different in its own way but effective nonetheless.",9,0,1,13 August 2019
Knives Out," Exemplary in its own right!
","An indeed fresh take in Murder Mystery sub-genre, that states itself in quality and near perfect execution. Rian Johnson as the director did a phenomenal job of making sure that every piece falls into its desired place. A well constructed writing, with some clever bits and pieces given here and there in order to tease the viewer; it certainly showcases its true merit in that regard. It makes us guess the actual culprit several times, it makes us confuse more with every new incident. Even though the revelation at the end wasn't totally surprising but the sheer amount of excellence in the build up alone could provide the much needed satisfaction. And I must point out the cumulative blend of Comedy and Suspense here; as the balance has been done tremendously well. They never crosses each others path and stays in their own territories. I liked that. Cinematography, Sound Design both pay homage to Vintage movies. The nostalgic locations somehow finds its similarities with classic cinemas that belonged from the same genre. Performances are outright brilliant. Each one of the characters have done justice to their respective roles. Special Mention must go to Daniel Craig, Ana de Armas and Chris Evans as they were truly the driving force behind.
Some political ideologies have also been talked about although they didn't portray much importance in here in terms of the storyline but surely showcased Different viewpoints in an interesting presentation nonetheless. In the end, It's a Well Directed, Brilliantly Written and Impressively Acted film that deserves more viewership. I would surely encourage you to do the same.",9,0,1,24 June 2020
Bird Box," The Book Was Better in Every Segment!
","An adaptation of Josh Malerman's superhit Novel goes by the same name 'Bird Box'.
Lot of expectations were due because of how successful the original book was. But things unfortunately turned up sideways.
Although It tried its best to standout on its own, gave all the efforts to match up with the level of the novel. But certainly failed to impress upon so many aspects. Let it be the CGI, The sound design, the characters. They all seemed unfinished and hurriedly written. Except Sandra Bullock's role as Malorie, I couldn't care for anyone else. One dimensional characters who haven't got any sort of depth don't do well when it comes to Sci Fi thrillers. That's a lesson everyone should learn. The asthetics are necessary and must be neatly executed; I agree on that but it doesn't mean you can blatantly ignore the rest of the parts. Sound Design left me enraged because of how little it provided even in the most tensed moments. Sound plays a huge part in mystery thrillers, if not done properly it can disrupt the whole ambience. That's exactly what happened! It miserably failed to generate a proper vibe or atmosphere accordingly! I have read the book before and I can say the book was so much better in terms of narrative decisions and clever approach to suspenseful moments. It brilliantly builds up the tension and leave you restless until the end comes. Unlike the film where the screenplay looked loose on many occasions and didn't provide thrill/tension in a consistent manner.
The two kids and their abilities are well demonstrated in the original novel but the makers somehow thought of doing otherwise. They put so much attention to other unnecessary short tenured characters and never really took the roles of those two kids seriously. Disheartened to see such an unprofessional approach towards a potential strong point of the plot. The hype is obviously exaggerated and trust me, who have read the book already, they don't need to see it. For those who haven't yet, Read the book. It's a lot better experience as a whole.",5,1,2,21 May 2020
The Shining," Classic Taste of Horror!
","Made in 80s, despite being 40 years old; it still gives tough competition to modern day and age horror movies. It was one of the those films that inspired the coming generations till date! And I can exactly see why! The direction is top notch, the camera work is phenomenal! Considering at that time they hadn't got the technological privileges like we do. Some shots, especially the long continuous ones were truly impressive! The sound score is most of the times kept on mute. Many interactions and scenes are being portrayed by their visual brilliance and it was up to the director and cinematographer to exhibit the essence of feel into those particular moments without getting help from sound tracks. Nowadays the formulas have drastically changed. The sound score plays a huge part now, especially in creating jump scares that not oftentimes work! This should be an example to those who calls out jump scares as the ultimate horror making formula. They need to see it in order to understand and believe that a horror film could succeed without keeping any sort of reliance into fake jump scares and loud sudden bursts of sounds!Enough with the technicalities...Now let's come to the performances, shall we? Jack Nicholson did a fantastic job. His portraiture of Jack Torrance is out of this world. Can't have enough words to express how great he was. A person who is losing sanity and turning into a menacing entity in a Progressive manner. It's so hard to portray! He was so fitting to it. I serious got terrified of his character and in some scenes he gave that creepy, evil vibes. He was absolutely magnificent! Shelley Duval as Wendy was great too. Many might have some reservations about her. But I think she made the role of her own. With her spectacular subtle presence on the screen made us scared of the On going circumstances. We could easily connect to her and feel empathy as well! Danny Lloyd who played the little kid's character surely had some good showing too. As per the sincerity goes they all performed to their very best.The storyline Seems simple on the surface but it has some deeper meanings to it. The ending twist has created different obsessive fan bases for sure! It's one of the first takes in Psychological Horror and I really loved the execution. It has that classic cult taste in it. Although I would have love to get a bit more clarity towards certain situations! I won't spoil what were they, but I expected and hoped for better explanations about some incidents that occurred in the plot. I think I might get the answers from the Sequel i.e. 'Doctor Sleep'. Let's see what we get. My next viewing is in line. Here I come.",8,0,2,17 May 2020
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Compelling and Unforgettable Experience
","Into the spider-verse is just what Spider Man fans wanted from a long time It delivers the exciting, thrilling journey of our beloved superhero through a good story with some pretty immense Character Development! Performances and Background score were at top level too! It just engages you till the end with it's world class Technical superiority and mind blowing Animations! You just can't keep your eyes closed for one sec ; it's that good! Although I wanted more from some characters ; Like Uncle Aaron, Kingpin and Spidey's mother! Nonetheless it was an enjoyable experience! Highly Recommended.",9,0,0,8 November 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Dissatisfied
","I have been a Marvel Fan since my childhood. It all started with Iron-Man and then flourished by the other movies in MCU! I watched each and every film to date. For a MCU admirer like me ; this film was disappointing to say the least. When infinity war ended, I was literally teared up by the experience I got. It boosted the hype, the anticipation to a new level! I was counting on the finale film to be the best I have ever seen in the MCU so far. But that dream, that wish of mine got shattered! Why? There are so many reasons behind it! Slow pace till the time travel sequences kicked up, lack of cohesiveness between the characters, not duly written script, lesser emotional impact ; all of these made the film less enjoyable for me. The only thing that saved it from being doomed for me is the Last 1 hour, the climax battle scenes are beautifully made. To have all the superheroes in one place and give proper screen times to everyone is a daunting task. They handled it pretty well! The performances especially from RDJ was memorable and touching at the same moment. Overall a decent film for my liking and for my expectancy that I had after The last film. It Should have been way way better. All of the True Marvel fans deserved it.",7,1,2,2 August 2019
Get Out," Different from the Rest!
","Being different always have two ways to go, either it will be easily accepted in the audience or thrashed severely by the same people. It took the risk and fortunately, it worked out! Jordan Peele has done an impressive job with the screenplay and presentation of the story. The clever use of passive racism and well written dialogues did their work ; they made the story engaging in the buildup phase. The sound score and the edits were brilliantly done. All of the technical aspects created An eeriness that gradually keeps you on the edge the whole time. Performances as usual were magnificent (Especially from the Lead actor Daniel Kaluuya). The brutality and the gore in the climax fulfilled the story. It makes your heart racing! Now you must be wondering if I'm praising this film that much ; then why I'm giving this a 7/10? There are some reasons for that! The Rod Williams character annoyed me the most, I don't understand the need of adding unnecessary comic scenes or humours into these kind of movies which are supposed to be serious and scary throughout ! Well I'm not going to spoil the main concept but it felt Poorly explained and illogical in a sense! The story could have easily elaborated all the facts in much more clearer fashion! The Director wanted to put all of our attention to the main character of Chris ; and in order to achieve that he somehow neglected the other major character buildups! Those were needed in my opinion. Overall a Technically sound movie that delivers on the main subject of Racism culture and at the same time makes you uneasy and scared but in no way it's a flawless film.",7,1,3,8 August 2019
Aladdin," Decent, That's All
","Disney's newly adaptation of the classic tale failed to shine despite the huge marketing and exposure it got through its promotion stage! Lack of integrity in the plot ; Weak character writings except The Genie (Whom I loved the most) and underwhelming setup of the kingdom made it look all average!Though they invested a lot on the CGI and sound department as it seems but forgot to create the magic it needed so desperately!Aladdin, Jasmine and the Antagonist they all looked just 'Fine' nothing extraordinary nor anything extravaganza there! Only Will Smith's Genie shined through it and overshadowed everyone's role to be honest.Many people might not agree to my not so popular opinion that Will Smith was the best choice for this role! And frankly without him this film with that hollow of a plot was bound to be a failure! Fortunately the charismatic presence and the witty humor of Will saved the day!In the end it's lacking the usual grandeur feel of a Disney fantasy film that's why it might not be for Everyone out there!Children might like this film a lot for the colorful presentation and the visual treat but for the matured audience especially those who have nostalgic feels about the Original Aladdin Animation Feature ; They Might regret watching this.",6,0,1,4 October 2019
The Lion King," The Technical Work is Supreme Here!
","I didn't see the Classic film so can't really make comparisons with the Original here! So I will be assessing it as an Individual Film.Right from the very beginning it catches my attention with the details and setup. Every inch of the atmosphere, the setting, the backdrop looks stunning! The makers here demonstrated their peak imagination and creativity levels and that transpired to this masterpiece of a work. Although the same Photo Realistic nature ruined the essence of being it an Animation Feature! The same CGI work that must be the highlight of the film is the downside too! and that sucks.Because of the too much Realism, we couldn't really notice much Expression variety wise in the Characters' faces, so it kind of becomes a Soulless representation of the Original Hit. Whether it's an emotional scene or a enthralling one ; The characters failed to express with versatility! Though the Voice cast has done their jobs pretty well, Especially Seth Rogen as Pumbaa and John Oliver as Zazou. The Story is Predictable and a Generic one too but it still teaches us Lots of lessons that one should follow in their own lives like Moral Values etc. But I do feel it lacked the Emotional Depth or Substance I was expecting, Some characters could have been given much more layers to them. They felt so stale. Screenplay and Sound Score was Brilliant as we all expect. The main Problem lies in the 2nd Act ; It didn't impress me as much the 1st One! The last act was just decent enough nothing extraordinary! I thought we should have gotten more from the Other characters like Rafiki.In the end it's a Movie that is targeted towards Children but Adults Can Enjoy too. And If you go with not greater expectations you might love it as well.",7,0,3,7 December 2019
1917," Sensational in Every Way!
","All aspiring film makers/cinematographers must take some notes from it. The amount of hardwork and dedication shown by the whole crew is truly commendable. The camera work, the editing, the direction; everything gelled together in perfection. It seriously couldn't get any better. No doubt it won 3 Oscars for Cinematography, Visual and Sound Design! It will be set as the epitome of Camera work for many times to come.Even If I keep aside the flamboyant technical supremacy here, we still get a solid storyline with some captivating performances given by the lead characters. The screenplay helped massively regarding the tightness of the plot and maintained the suspense till the end. Although frequently in few scenes I saw it dipped a Little bit that's why I'm not giving it a Full Mark. Nonetheless it was riveting, breathtaking at places. There are some particular scenes that I won't explain here but You will surely get to see some of your life's best visual experience there. This film managed to give a surreal experience of being within the action. You will get a feeling that you are a part of the journey. Not many films have done that before. For that point of view it's a must watch. Grab onto your seat and give it a go. It's something you won't ever forget in your entire lifetime.",9,1,2,10 May 2020
Midsommar," Ari Aster Is a Legend In Making!
","My love for horror movies are deep. Especially for those deep, dark and disturbing ones. Hence My Niche for Ari Aster Directions has suddenly risen up. The way he presents horror is so unconventional yet so pleasing.I loved his debut directorial 'Hereditary'. Though I hated the ending; because of how it felt unsatisfying for me considering how great the rest of the film was. This time though he improvised a lot.It's beautifully shot, with some craftsmanship and innovation in cinematography. Every horror film maker should get some inspirations from. The sound score is greatly fitted alongside some creepy imagery. The tone was already set in the first few minutes. It gradually became better and better scene by scene. The shots grasped me by its sheer simplified yet haunting nature. I craved for more and more. The gorgeous locations helped in that regard too.The Art direction should be applauded here cause the level is so damn high. The detailing in every scene is insanely done. Ari Aster really takes his game seriously on every aspect. And he never wants to compromise in any sort. The storyline is a twisted tale of Some Pagan Cult's Rituals, but cleverly foreshadowing an Important Character Arc. I would not discuss that cause that may ruin the experience for you. It's better to have it by yourself!
But All I can say that really got me by surprise. Cause how well these two contrary things have collaborated together and gave us a perfect outcome for both of them. The actors have done their Job with Honesty. Their commitment to the roles could easily be noticed.Florence Pugh as Dani shines the brightest among them. The way she showcases her emotions/angst through only facial expressions and lesser dialogues is truly commendable. Mr. Aster surely has a great eye when it comes to finding a great actor for the lead. In some particular scenes she has shown pure brilliance.Although I have few complaints in the same aspect here. Although Dani and Christian's character were greatly written. I wish the other friend characters had a tad more importance as well. That's the only Con I have.Having said that, this film surely played with my mind. Even after finishing the movie; I felt an emptyness inside. A kind of unsettling vibe that made me at unease. I rarely get that feel whenever watching a film. And it surely means that it deeply affected me. And I love it when films do that. I enjoy this Deep Down my mind.",9,1,6,18 April 2020
Joker," Joaquin Won the Golden Glove for it and Rightfully So!
","Phenomenal performance by Joaquin alongside some supreme technicality in direction, screenplay with a Solid Background score ; this film made my Jaw Drop! On many occasions I was just simply spellbound by the sheer Integrity the character has shown! I loved every moment Joaquin Aka Joker was on frame.
The way he laughed, danced, walked, delivered the dialogues they were all at their perfection! I just can't express enough how spectacular Joaquin has performed ; you need to see it to believe it! The haunting score, beautiful colour tones and the way Director has executed the scenes ; They all complimented each other very well and resulted in a Perfection! Those who are comparing it to Heath's portrayal, Just Don't! Both characters are great in their own ways but I must say this one is more humane and layered compared to the previous one We all have seen and adored in The Dark Knight! The character development is so damn good that despite Arthur Aka Joker being a bad guy and a psycho you would actually root for him! You would actually Sympathise with him instead of claiming him a straight bad character! That's the perfection every Drama film should draw some inspirations from!
Although This film is probably one of my all time favourite now But still I have a little complaint about it!
I wanted to see more from Wayne Family or Gotham City in general. They provided just enough to make us capable of understanding the story line but I genuinely wanted more from the other characters as well.
But in the End it's a film about Joker and his insurgency so I don't mind much.
Very Highly Recommended.",9,3,8,6 January 2020
It Chapter Two," It doesn't have the same feel as its predecessor!
","I loved 'IT', the first movie. That is surely one of my top favorite horror movies like ever! So as usual I had too much excitement for the sequel 2 years after. Alas! That eagerness resulted in a poor Sigh. This chapter two isn't bad but not great either. As most of us are coming from the first movie; expecting the same experience once again! That's why majority of us couldn't really liked the film. No matter how hard I tried, believe me; I wanted it to be good. But unfortunately, honestly saying it's not even close to what 'IT' was!The Storyline here is convoluted, messy. The writing here arouses much more questions than answers! Characters lacked depth unlike the first one, where the character build ups were brilliantly done! As a result of poor characterization; I couldn't really feel much connection to them. The relatability factor was on the lower side. The performances are fine, Greatly assembled set of actors who are both talented and experienced; gave all they could. But The emotional connection I felt with the child actors on the previous film was surely missed in here. The horror scenes are too many, at one time it becomes repetitive in nature. The extra long duration don't help either. Some scenes seemed unnecessarily stretched! Although the scenes themselves are made well enough regarding the technicalities and CGI work but the surprise element was long gone after the first few. Having said that, the confusive blend of Sci Fi And Horror, that I couldn't really fathom. It looks like the makers decided to put some tributes to Some Famous Sci Fi films like Alien, ET etc.In the end it's a decent okayish movie, that doesn't really justify as a sequel, but could have done better, had it been a standalone one.",6,0,1,15 April 2020
Parasite," The Social Commentary, It Showcases is Spectacular!
","If a film makes you think continuously even after the show ends, it must be a great one! And this one did just that. Packed with terrific direction, commendable performances from the whole cast, the sheer excellence in story writing and screenplay alongside some beautifully crafted cinematography this film is surely a treat in every category. It made me think, it made me curious about the nuances and the small details and hints it got all over it. I just couldn't express the feelings I got watching this. In one word it's truly a masterpiece!It Won 4 academy awards this year, and that's not a mean feat! Making history at the oscars by winning the best film award as a foreign film for the first time ever. It alone portrays how much this film has been applauded by the critics, the industry people and us ; the audience. This is one of those rare movies where majority of us have the same opinion about. It's entertaining, thrilling, with some dark twists and some disturbing scenes as well that will surely make an impact in your mind. I assure you ; this movie will be in your head for a very long period of time!It brilliantly exposes the capitalism system in society that has been presented as the 'Parasite' in here. The class difference, the economical boundaries set by the same people. It does symbolise with every aspect of the core issues that every major society in the world currently faces. One thing That I absolutely loved about it was the simplistic way it took to handle those sensitive subjects. And it can be applicable to any country though it's been made having Korean culture and society in mind ; this story, would be relatable to everyone. No matter the country Someone lives in.But you need to give your sincere focus and intellectuality while watching as it demands that. Every scene there has been crafted metaphorically. And those clever set ups can only be observed thoroughly if you are paying enough attention. Every character and their actions represent something. And you need to find that connection. And don't worry you will ; as the direction has been top notch throughout the entirety of the film. The character developments and The hidden metaphors are a treat to watch and experience.My own personal tip would be to avoid every promo, trailer and articles before watching it. Going with a blank slate will help you to digest every bit of it naturally.
Enough of the review now, I just wanna say, go and watch this film immediately. It's amazing and a surreal experience that could not be forgotten easily. Top of the table recommendation.",10,20,32,11 February 2020
Fifty Shades of Grey," Specifically Made for Specific People!
","A Sensuous Erotica, that prevails on refined execution that explicitly delivers what it was supposed to. A fresh addition into Romance/Drama genre; that sparked lots of Controversies and polarized opinions.
Mainly due to its naked nature in the portrayal of passion and sexual pleasures that has been duly debated all over the community. Barring the hatred, one cannot simply ignore the Polished cinematography and sound design that has been provided. The sets, the ambience, the tonality hit the right note in every frame. Moreover the performances by the main two leads, added the professional touch to it.
Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele and Jamie Dornan as Christian Gray shined well.
It takes a lot of courage and a bit of sincerity to say yes to such provocative yet challenging roles. Some credit should go to the director herself as well!
Sam Taylor-Johnson, did a phenomenal job in her own right. She managed to handle all the nuances regarding the above mentioned characters and carefully crafted the odd but sparkling relationship between them. Alas! The same cannot be said about the other roles. Drifting away from the norm, In this abyss of luscious journey; In the hindsight of passion and intense love; the deeper prospects are not profoundly addressed; but a subdued approach is followed. The subtlety sometimes dragged the screenplay a tad bit though. The sensual scenes, the erotic moments; never seemed vulgar. Although the BDSM aspects at times felt borderline abusive. But it depends on an individual's perspective too. As someone might find it pleasurable; others may find it offensive and far away from a rational thing.
The distinctive viewpoints are obvious, But to consider it as a trash is far fetched and nothing but an intentional ignorance. Sexual likings and All these sensitive stuffs are always borderline controversial. These things can easily go awry oftentimes but that doesn't mean it always needs to be under the microscope of criticism and sort of a plaything for the hateful audience.",7,2,2,28 May 2020
Mother!," So close to Perfection but not reached the True Potential
","Being different and unique always paves the way for attention, Be it Good or Bad ; Ultimately it creates the much needed exposure a film needs to get. Many people might have problems with the symbolism of Bible in here ; But if you can keep aside the religious views, You get a Brilliantly acted and executed art piece! Though some pacing issues in the first half and Some weird close up & over the shoulder camera angles bothered me but the finale, the last 40 mins just blew my mind! It was a lot to take in ; it just plays with your mind. You get Anxious, Disturbed and Tensed by the events that happen at those times simultaneously. Kudos to the director and the actors as well to keep up the momentum and Relativity through these moments. Overall a must watch for the people who love something different and Doesn't mind the 'Controversial' content or portrayals! Just go with an open mind ; you will experience a journey that will be in your mind for a very long period of time. I assure you that.",9,1,2,3 July 2019
