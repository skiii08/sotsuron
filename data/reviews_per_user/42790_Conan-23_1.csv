The Blair Witch Project," Why Would Anyone Like This Movie?
","I used to think Universal Soldier was the worst movie ever made, however, after seeing the Blair Witch Project I have a new Worst Movie.  What a horrendously bad movie.  They made this movie with no real script in mind...AND IT SHOWED!!!  Three fourths of the movie is one person telling another person to turn off the camera.  I wish they would have turned it off and saved the audience from this incredibly boring and annoying ordeal.This movie does not deserve the attention that it is getting.  Trust me, YOU have made better movies on vacation.  Stay at home and watch your home movies rather than going to see this movie.  You'll have a much better time.",1,1,2,6 August 1999
