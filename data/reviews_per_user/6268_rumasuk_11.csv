The Avengers," the avengers gave me my very first nerdgasm
","Please if you haven't watched it yet, don't read my review or any other review, just go and see it!if you are not into marvel movies, if you haven't watched every other previous installment of the avengers, you won't find this movie very appealing to you. But, if you have watched every previous movie, if you like the characters, then prepare yourself, because Joss Whedon has put together one of the best movies ever made by man!!thats the thing about this movie, its not really a movie on its own, i mean, it expects you to know the characters, and thats just what it has to be. This is not really a movie but a cinematic experience. If the other marvel movies are as getting to know somebody, flirting with that somebody, foreplay, the avengers is sex. Thats the best way i can put it.You can really fell that Whedon knows and loves this characters, because he takes the core elements of each of the avengers personalities and uses them for building the problems, the humor, the companionship. I have to say this is the best team assembly i have seen. This movie has the best humor, the best action, the best acting, the best characterization, the best everything.For the first time, i felt a nerdgasm, I'm not lying or exaggerating, i felt it.Any person who criticizes this movie did not get it at all, did not get the point of it, because the avengers will change cinema forever, i mean it.I love good movies, i do, i know a lot of movies and I'm not a person that watches only Hollywood movies, but i can say this. The avengers is one of the best experiences i have ever had in my whole life. i will see it at least 3 times more",10,6,13,28 April 2012
Iron Man 3," cool looking, not badly written, action packed (and fine, well thought action) a great film
","i really like the iron man series, even 2 (i loved Sam Rockwell). This movie took the funny tone of the previous film but it became something else, its a thriller with a journey for our main character. The story is not bad at all, it has some corny moments but for me it fitted perfectly.what the movie does great is generating all the conditions (with a good fluid story) for the action set pieces, which were probably the best in marvel universe, maybe even challenging the avengers. The sequences are very well thought: there's a sequence in which tony has to fight the villains just by himself, no armor, and instead of being boring it was a great scene. The action is smart and freaking awesome, the last fight was incredible.the actors are of course great, the story will probably bother some orthodox fans but if you take it easy and accept the cinematic continuity is different (i think there will be 3 fictional years between avengers 1 y 2, and they haven't lived together or do anything else than brawling for one afternoon in new york) you'll see this was truly a great film. And what a start for phase 2...SPOILERS!!!!!!!: guy Pearce was the best freaking villain in the marvel universe so far!!! he didn't have the charisma, attitude or violence of Sam Rockwell, Jeff bridges or mickey Rourke, but he was way smarter, equally ruthless and just too damn bad ass!!! also he built his own superpowers andï»¿ his plan was actually pretty good. Iron man has the best history of actors playing villains and Pearce nailed it as the villain, he was AWESOME, i actually think hes the only villain with a plan that makes sense.",7,1,9,28 April 2013
The Big Lebowski," my favourite movie of all times
","Its pretty good, if you like movies made by the coen brothers you will laugh a lot with this one. Its one of those movies where is more important to enjoy each scene than to sum all the scenes together to make a central storyline, for plot-obsesives this might not be what you're looking for but it still has a GOOD STORY. Jeff bridges is known for any other movie rather than this one, but for me this is his best performance, also the character he plays is the coolest in filmaking history.Also has a good nostalgic soundtrack.has clever humour, the best catchphrases and the best main character ever... if you re into the coen brothers i think this is the real masterpiece (yeah better than fargo and brother where art thou, i said it, don't kill me).i love this movie, i think the dude is the product of perfect parenthood, f_ck it man... BEST MOVIE EEVAAAAAR",10,1,3,10 September 2009
Star Trek Into Darkness," bad film
","i never give my opinion in films that are bad but this one got so much praise that i feel is my duty to write something somewhere. the main problem is, i felt the first one didn't quite make it in the climax department and this one is even worse. The story is not bad its just not very interesting and its supposed to rely in the weight of the relations between characters, and thats how they failed, abrahms lacks personality in his characters like most big budget directors who have forgotten about real human day by day, so their conversations happen like in most Hollywood movies, they feel artificial and built. We re bashed in the face with the theme with Spock and kirk and friendship but its really not done well, its plain simple and very far away from a real friendship, consequently it ends up being kind of hilariously gay and unaware of it at some points.the characters are boring the set pieces look like set pieces built to get some human moments after the cgi transitions (but they look good) and even though its got a couple of smart moments, it really doesn't justify its own existence. Its not a bad movie its the perfect definition of a meh movie. jj abrahms is not that bright my friends, hes a poor man's Steven Spielberg, i ve seen all of his movies and they present itselves like they are full of magic and charm, and they're not, and lost sucks, it was a show built around chasing payoff, that never gave us anything important of ground breaking, they just created conditions so jumping the shark would go a little bit unnoticed.yeah thats it, star wars 7 will probably more generic than the first 6 combined, and thats saying a lot giving the first one was built around the idea of homage",6,0,3,8 September 2013
Thor: Ragnarok," Crazy colorful space warrior adventure on the big screen,
","The movie is great. It's a new experience. It does have deep flaws that affected my experience though, but a good enjoyable fresh movie overall.The movie will be a pretty fresh experience. 80 percent of it its outer worlds adventure extravaganza. The planets and designs are incredible. The story is pretty cool too. But...My problem with it it's not what some people have pointed out: The movie is way more of a comedy than the previous two. It's just that Taika Waititi didn't care about taking the plot seriously at all, like in purpose. You don't need to have a loose plot to be hilarious and a comedy masterpiece, look at the first Hangover, look at how high the stakes were in that movie. This movie jumps from point a to b without any regard on how or why, a clear example of this is the Hulk. I have expected since Age of Ultron for marvel to answer how Hulk left for another planet and the answer is 'He just did'? This is true for all the plot points in the movie. This is just the sort of thing the Russos would have polished completely while keeping all the jokes.I thought the story was full of missed opportunities (Fan Fic incoming, skip if you hate Fan Fic mindsets) why not have the hammer be a limitation of Thor's true power created by Odin to limit him so what happened to Hela becoming evil and unstoppable never happens to him. Making not only Thor's unlocking of his true potential logical but also symbolical now that he lives in a world where his father, the most powerful man wont be there to protect his world. The Thor Hulk fight was cool as hell, even if it was a little simple, it looked incredible. They gave it a definitive space pay per view filter or something. It looked awesome. Hela was cool as well. AND HERE's my biggest defense for the whole movie: Thor himself was great. It felt Waititi designed the whole process of the movie on getting who Chris Hemsworth is, how (Chris Hemsworth) HE sees Thor not how Kevin Feige or Marvel or we the fans have told him to act. How he could actually connect with a Thor he was frankly disconnected from more and more. And I think in this aspect for what the movie is, they had a freaking home run. Hemsworth is fresh again and better than ever. He is awesome, he is Thor and he enjoys it. It feels more like a psychological acting directorial procedure milestone more than a movie merit. But directors should look at whatever Waititi did, because he might have unlocked Chris Hemsworth potential to be awesome to watch on camera. There you have something I can not stop giving props to. So yeah objectively a 7/10 but I would re watch this a thousand times over the 2 previous ones. Also I can not give enough merit on how this movie readjusted Thor incredibly well without him feeling at all like a new character or forced in any way. Its just great overall.I would like to see him in other movies. He could have a serious role in a war movie or a criminal thriller. Hemsworth rocked, and Loki as much as I hated him in the past due to his popularity is freaking incredible as he has always been.",8,51,91,29 October 2017
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," great stuff
","i loved the film, it was awesome. The story is about events of the political direction of shield, but its really a simple story, kind of dumb actually like any other marvel movie, but the theme of the movie is kind of relevant in our current lives and that kinda makes this movie really bold, it even has a point of view!. the winter soldier will be there kicking ass, and let me tell you he is awesome, a freaking delight to watch, and they give you many action scenes with him involved, but the movie is not really about him, its about shield, winter soldier will start his story here, but any development of the character will be made in sequels. also black widow who was on cap's side all the movie and falcon, the team 's Milhouse were really cool specially widow, who is kinda more interesting, and for some reason her relation with cap was my favorite thing in the movie.The action was class A material, super soldier serum awesomeness, cap falls 20 stories, breaks walls, kicks ass, and the winter soldier does the same but on the opposite side, the coolest thing is that his metal arm is kind of a reversal to cap's shield in some ways. There's is just enough action here. The acting was great as always (thank you marvel studios) Evans is cap, and widow feels kind of right this time by being the same but more developed (not sure if it makes sense). The directing of the Russo brothers was top notch, great cinematography, choreographed scenes, a couple of dumb moments but overall, a major step up from the first film, this movie really kicked ass.what i liked most is that is kind of a bromance movie, but between cap and widow, you feel they are really bonding, in a bro way, some sexual tension yes, but mostly good awesome fun multi gender friendship, the writers really made widow cap's current best friend and both together were really fun to watch, you can see they're having fun with each other.spoiler talk!!! Crossbones is born at the end of the movie, winter soldier is free looking for answers, and shield is down!, I'm really curious on what they'll do next but I'm freaking excited for the 1st after credits scene, the twins are ready, and judging by the Italy shoot, the first mission in movie 2 will be in baron Von Strucker's castle, fighting the kids.",8,4,8,30 March 2014
Man of Steel," its not the superman i would write, but its the one Goyer would write, and its pretty damn good as it is
","i watched an interview with David Goyer talking about how he wrote superman, there he said, that after one point where he was stuck in the beginning, he chose not to look as much comics as reference as before and to concentrate in the same influences Siegel and Shuster had when they created the character. What he wanted was not exactly glorify the great superman we know from his many incredible stories in comics, and instead create a character with a function in a logical world, just as he did in batman begins. Thats how Goyer does it best, and i was afraid of that because it proved great in begins and dark knight, but lost my love a little bit in the dark knight rises. I thought maybe the guy was not the better choice for a superman movie. But what he did was creating a world with a character with a deep inner journey facing an upcoming disaster which will make him choose between the two sides of who he is, the he followed the logical conclusion of the story. He 'Goyered' it. Now we needed the best visuals to complement this, they needed somebody to 'Snyder' it. And the pair (as contrary as many critics who call this movie a train wreck think) were awesome, great stuff, they made the superman movie i can watch repeatedly and have real fun.Actingwise, they were great, Cavill was charismatic as a good small town boy (and he made me question my sexuality), I'm happy to see him as superman in next movies. every other actor was great. script wise, it suffers from Goyer's problems (also present in batman movies) its good dialog but few times we have a line that is good as a reflection of events currently happening, but its not really a believable line, but thats the guy and thats how he writes, and i don't want to change him because he did a pretty exceptional work, i don't think there's a single bad line in the movie and i loved the dialog a few times, like with his father and with Zod. visually: freaking awesome, the battle of Smallville was incredible and the last battle was great as well, I don't think they abused the action, I actually thank them because the bar was raised in my opinion. the villains were pretty believable, I liked them, their reasons were very logical and I understood them.SPOILERS: i think the story was fluid and i don't get the critics, I have been watching many reviewers trash this movie, and they act like true imbeciles, their hate is unjustified, its basically nitpicking, just because the movie don't do cheap laughs and a lot of people die (did they watch the same movie as i did, superman didn't have a single moment, if he had saved people falling, thousand more would have died because he would have been kicked in mid air and sent to the other side of the city, he had to fight, if he didn't win we were lost. he is trying at hes best but hes new at this, hes not thinking right now about anything else as beating this assholes. Also when goyer talks about this he says this: we wanted to make very clear superman its not god, he is limited as any real living creature would be, you now what, they did. He could have suffered more after watching the city destroyed but i think this could be addressed in the next installment without changing things.my problem was, why didn't Kriptionans, knowing they were going to die, let Zod die right there right now?, did they not know they would be liberated as soon as they would die, messing up everything in the first place? at least Lara new they would destroy everything as soon as they're free.about the killing thing, of course I'm not happy to watch superman kill someone, but that was the only option he had, for that not to happen, the story had to be different. i didn't like the moment but i wouldn't change the story at all. it was not only a murder but a decision for the character, maybe not built for the superman we know, but for this new Goyer superman fits perfectly. he had to choose between the two sides of himself which had been in conflict since he was a kid.the movie was a great start, i think Goyer have to be part of DC universe after this, his tone is part for the experience, but i think he has to have a lot of chats with other visions before the JLA. anyway, I'm psyched for what he will come out with between batman and superman in their classic world's finest fashion, i just want to see the fun of that in the big screen. also flash and wonder woman which i love and green lantern which is a good character as well, the martian, all of them done right, could be the most epic experience ever, i know people love the avengers and i do too, i gave their movie a 10 out of 10, but the justice league is incredible in comics and TV, they are the best team in existence, if they do them right in the perfect story, prepare for the box office success that will define the next decades",8,3,7,17 June 2013
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Im seeing this again
","Yes!, it does not have any major surprises that you haven't seen before. But it has a couple of small surprises that are really cool. First of all, yeah there are LOTS of one liners, but i think the avengers would talk like that between each other even in the face of extinction. Its funny sometimes but it has it good share of bad jokes. Yeah i saw those criticisms in other reviews and i thought i would address them first. NOW, the good stuff, its great to see them working as a team, the opening scene was great, their relationship as a team and buddies is awesome, even with the occasional bad one liner. Each character gets his time in the spotlight and this time i felt every character was great, every one. Ultron is great, he is not as menacing as we thought he would be, but he has a lot of time on screen and that is really great because we get to see him doing his stuff. The twins are good too, their accents are funny but they have a good story as small as it is and their motivations are well presented. Their powers are the thing i felt lacked exploration but its OK. The action is the best freaking thing we've seen on screen, it has the best scenes of any marvel movie and they give you a lot of action sequences. The final brawl was inventive, bad ass and stylish. Spoilers!!Vision was a great character, he is just as the movie version of vision should be. Hawkeye small segment was awesome, is one small surprise that might not be that important but it really gave me a reason to care for him. The action was effing amazing, there are 4 or 5 major sequences and every single one is long and awesome. But they were never boring. The team at the end is great, lets see what are they going to do with it. Ultron and Vision last chat was pretty awesome and the best bit of foreshadowing in the whole movie. Ultron's plan was one of the best evil plans for me, very simple yet very new and something i didn't expect. The title is kind of dumb, age of Ultron? he's just there for a week at most, thats not an age.",8,10,23,30 April 2015
Thor," i will carry a hammer in my backpack from now on
","the movie delivers pretty well. i think the best thing about marvel studios is that they have a big interest in the characters themselves. the performances made the movie for me. the story is not as twisty as i have expected but it does not bore at all. the battle scenes are awesome but there's a lesson to learn, don't watch marvel movie trailers ever again. All the action sequences are shown in one way or another in the trailers (just like iron man 2), but it was great fun, I'm gonna definitely watch it again and i know I'm not the only one. i loved Chris hemsworth as Thor, he was the best part of the film in my opinion (robert Downey and Edward Norton were the best part of their respective films also, so we can conclude marvel is doing a damn freaking great job) plus the scene where selvig and Thor return to the trailer after some drinks is priceless... the 2 cameos were great as well.",7,3,7,30 April 2011
Prometheus," great film
","i really really liked prometheus, after checking reviews on the internet i really wasn't expecting a great film, but i got it. maybe is the fact that I've never really cared for the alien series, but I didn't see the problems with the story a lot of people did. there are some plot holes, and some times in the film they just create more havoc instead of answering the questions the movie made, but that's OK, its not done in a stupid way, and every one of this questions is left open. i think that's actually cool in a movie, of course there are important things yet to be explained in sequels, but again, that's OK. The visuals are freaking mkther fkker incredible, and the story is not bad, the main theme of the film might be clichÃ© but i don't agree with it has been done a million times before, and anyone that says this is running by the same logic of saying all action films are the same.prometheus is a movie to watch at the earlier showing, not because of the daylight outside,but because this movie is best to be seen without many people in the theater, immersion is key for prometheus, but i think it pays. don't expect a new way to tell a story, a innovative narrative or an original idea, but expect a great way to tell a story, a great use of a narrative we know from other films, and a good premise based on an idea that might not be new, but will always haunt humanity",8,2,7,18 June 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," this movie i mean.... it was OK
","i feel bad for giving this movie a 6, it deserves a 6.5 in my rating system. Its better told than the 2nd one, but aside from the effects and action sequences, well it sucks.I'm surprised that people like this better than transformers 2. my guess is that they hated the 2nd one so much that this could seem only better. Because this movie is not better than the second one, its just told in a better way (slightly).Im sorry if you re a united states citizen, but every movie that goes for the proud us flag waving in the back style of script fails, and fails in a big way. Bay movies are no masterpiece in my opinion, they are written for people who are very different than me and my kind of people.don't get me wrong i enjoyed the movie, but i knew what it was. The action scenes are awesome, like really awesome, specially the falling building scene and the final battle: the new bad guy fought off all the autobots like a MACHO, and he gets killed in the most pussy way. the dialog SUCKS, in the name of freedom we declare you the war?? damn that was bad. At least there is no mudflap and his brother who were awful in the second film.for me there were like 6 big plot holes and did i mention the dialog sucked? but the acting was not bad for me. another thing that bugged me, Malkovich, Mcdormand and Turturro are all major Coen brothers stars, are they friends with Bay or what?.i didn't hate the movie, the action was awesome and only that gave it the six points i gave it. i would like to give it more because i gave the previous movie a 7, but i will change the score of the previous film to 6 as well, because thats is the score the trilogy deserves.Bay should go on a mystical trip to other cultures and return to filmaking after at least 5 years, he should change his views because he is being toss aside of whats really cool nowadays",6,0,2,5 July 2011
