Despicable Me 2," Just a typical sequel...
","Honestly, sequels to movies are never very good. Unless it is a to-be- continued sequel. This one, however, is a 'let's make another movie to continue this movie, even though it doesn't need to be continued, for the sake of extra money and spotlight!' sequel. This movie felt like a tired, formal shell of the original. I usually find that when it comes to a poor movie or TV show, the issue will be that it was a good idea, but wasn't done well. That is the issue with this movie. The plot line was rather creative but the gags were weak, the characters were bland, there was too much lazy filler which had left me uninterested in the middle of the movie, and the ending was predictable. If you liked Gru's original character, expect a lot out of movies, or are a feminist, then this isn't the movie for you.",Null,0,0,15 February 2015
Divergent," can you say 'disappointing?'
","I am not very into the trilogy that this movie is based on, but I really liked the first book. I was quite excited to see it as a movie, entering the theater with high hopes. The clothing design was sexist. Seriously, it's the future, and women are still accustomed to body-revealing 'serious' clothes; ranging from sexy skin-tight Erudite mini-skirts to Tris's sexy black tank top. The book was nothing like this; women wore pants.Excuse me for being a feminist, but that was a small part of the movie that had bugged me. The acting was bland, the character designs were bland, and the whole movie was rushed. Each scene just... breezed by, like the whole movie was saying 'okay, okay, yeah, yeah, you saw this scene already, let's just get this story over and done with because, apparently, the writers just don't care about our personal entertainment.'the length had made it seem like a kid's movie, along with the fact that even the romance scenes with Tris and Four were small and sped up, and the violence scenes! There was hardly any violence. For example at the scene where Tris was almost pushed over the chasm, there was literally a few pushing and shoving and then DONE. And where are the guns? The book had included real guns with bullets, but in the movie everyone was using these weird, 'futuristic' guns that shot spike- like bullets and didn't even show blood... no one told me this was a freaking PG movie.What a waste of money. The book had unforgettable characters, great dialogue, and creative, heart-shattering scenes. This movie felt more like a joke; I wouldn't be surprised to find out, one day, that this had actually been made as a parody of sci-fi/action/romance movies. It would have done better as a parody than as a movie.",2,1,1,15 February 2015
The Holiday," A typical rom-com; laughably bad.
","The movie was quite entertaining to watch and had some semi-funny scenes. But it was highly predictable and above-average cheesy, with unrealistically happy characters. Two women with traumatizing back stories swap houses because they both need a vacation, and they both have, well, a hell of a holiday! This movie is an amusing display of how unpredictably stupid and untrustworthy that men can be, and how a movie director will pass all the lines of sappiness to remind us of the magic of Christmas, and that anything can happen within two special weeks. The characters look and act like they belong out of commercials advertising fun vacations for happy families, but the movie does manage to tackle some real-life stuff that a lot of us struggle with, right before providing happy endings for all! Oh, how I would love to live in a rom-com...",6,1,2,17 August 2015
