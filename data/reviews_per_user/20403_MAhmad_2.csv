The Rock," A well defined ACTION movie
","I'm just watching this again as we speak and I just cant get enough of this movie. I'm skeptical of ever enjoying action movies too much because of horrible acting/bad story/sappy action scenes, especially movies directed by Michael Bay this this beats the rap. It is well balanced with plot holes that are forgivable because its a very fun movie. Rarely do you get to see such an action movie of this caliber. Almost inline with Die Hard, Terminator and Matrix. And the soundtrack.... WOW. Props to Zimmer for having such an awesome soundtrack. Every track is enjoyable even after the 100th time of listening to em.So overall, this action movie has everything you want from an action movie. It stands above other CGI driven techno crap that is produced today with live explosions and stunts. A must have for any collection.9/10",9,2,2,15 June 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," The best darn picture ever made
","This truly has to be the greatest film ever made.  This film has you hooked from beginning to end and never loses its edge.  And to think that it came from 'Stephen King' although this is not the first time King has given us such a great flick ('Stand By Me', 'Misery', 'The Shining').  Whats more unbelievable is that it was snubbed of the Best Picture for both the Oscars and Golden Globe.  Sure 'Forrest Gump' was a great film but it's not often that you find a movie so captivating and can have such a beautiful, edgy and realistic storyline.  Even the AFI's '100 movies 100 years' didn't include this in their list.  Both critics and audiences have had positive things to say about this movie.  I think that if you haven't watched it yet, then you truly can't understand what true movie-making is all about.",10,0,1,20 April 1999
