Catch Me If You Can," Enjoyable, fascinating movie that absorbs you!
","I found this film really enjoyable. It joins a prestigious category of films based on true life stories, such films seem better than the general manufactured storylines.This film gave Leonardo Di Caprio the chance to use his baby face looks to great effect - at long last. Tom Hanks also gave a solid supporting role which is unsurprising for someone of his ability.",8,1,2,2 March 2003
Goodfellas," Excellent, enthralling film, don't miss it
",This film ranks high up in estimation alongside The Godfather as a truly enthralling film about gangster life. Its 100% interesting and its the sort of film thats so interesting you dare not blink for a second. And whats more is that its based on a true story!,Null,0,0,7 November 2002
