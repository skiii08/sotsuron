Hereditary," It all comes down to opinion.. and mine is HEREDITARY was a towering disappointment.
","I have been anticipating Hereditary for months. From the first trailer to podcast interviews with the director and the incredible reviews I was amped up to fall in love with this film. I've seen others who dislike it say it's 'too artsy'...that's lame. I've seen others who love it, say 'mainstream audiences just don't get it and are dumb'..that too is lame. I adore films that try new things and/or don't answer all the questions. The slower the burn the better, but Hereditary had very little fire to burn. There just isn't much here. The title says it all, craziness runs in the family..it's hereditary. I get it. The film meandered until it just became limp and goofy. If you want to see a truly bizarre and creepy film, see last year's The Killing Of A Sacred Deer - It's not horror but it's often horrific and electrifying. Hereditary has a nice creepy start then dissipates into thin air. The acting is fine (especially the young male lead) and it looks great. Unfortunately, in my (experienced horror film connoisseur) opinion there was no ground broken here. If you're in the mood for a real slow burn chiller, see Peter Medak's 1980 film The Changeling.",3,20,50,11 June 2018
Climax," Repellent, listless, pointless and empty.
","I was in the mood for something different, something fresh and unpredictable.. With the current events in the world, I thought I could use some artful escapism.. I've been meaning to see this for a while and I remember enjoying Gaspard Noe's intense and disturbing Irreversible.. BUT unfortunately Noe's Climax is an absolute waste. A couple of interesting angles and talented dancers does not a good film make. The possible takeaway of a plot or a message might be drugs are bad...Beyond that there is no sign of a plot. It's mind boggling anyone backed this film.. A24 has made some of my favorite films in recent memory (Uncut Gems, Under The Skin, A Ghost Story, Eighth Grade, It Comes At Night..), all challenging and artful in their own way, but Climax is completely empty trash. The opening dance was enthralling, I thought it might get interesting but only spiraled from there.. Watching people freaking out on drugs is way less interesting than the filmmakers must have thought it was. I almost wish I had left on the ugly world news than watch this dreck. I cannot recommend this film on any level. It it quite possibly the worst film I've managed to sit through. 100% repellent and uninteresting.",1,2,4,1 February 2020
La La Land," A wonderful and loving ode to the dreamers and artists of the world.
","When I first saw the trailer for La La Land my expectations were set high. The excellent cast, the music and an exciting new director/writer were enough to get me in the door. I'm always a bit hesitant when it comes to filmed musicals.. Will it be stagy, stilted and awkward? Not in this case. Damien Chazelle has made a wonderfully cinematic and loving ode to the dreamers and artists of the world. Having lived in LA and worked on both sides of the camera I can relate to much of this film's endearing observations, trials and tribulations; but anyone who's ever yearned for what seems impossible and searched for true love will also easily connect with this film's gargantuan heart. I'm a self proclaimed total movie snob not easily pleased by much of what I see, but La La Land gave me all the feels and more. I cannot recommend this film enough. It's the kind of film you leave and you don't want the buzz, the tickle, the movie-high to end. I can't wait to see it again when it's in wide release. The artist in me is inspired again.",10,220,387,17 September 2016
