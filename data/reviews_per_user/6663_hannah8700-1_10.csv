The Incredible Hulk," Truly 'Incredible!'
","Well, somebody finally got it right this time! This new version of 'The Incredible Hulk' is exactly what the first one failed to accomplish. Everything about the movie made it great- the acting, the plot, the story line, and its evil, yet very worthy opponent. It's exciting, entertaining, action-packed and suspenseful and keeps you right on the edge of your seat the entire time. Edward Norton did a fantastic job as 'Mr. Green' and met everyone's expectations. The fact that he helped write the screenplay for the film says a lot about his talents and abilities as an actor as well. Liv Tyler delivered a good performance too and together they both added a great deal more to the film. Her character is compassionate and kind which I found to make Norton's character more human. And the little bit of romance they had on the side too wasn't a bad idea either. Every great comic book hero has to have his girl, that damsel in distress that requires rescuing from time to time. And I was surprised to find that some lines Norton delivered in the movie were actually quite humorous and that's always a plus. The last battle sequence between the Hulk and the 'Abomination' was awesome. The ending leaves the story line wide open for a sequel with a special appearance from Tony Starks, the Iron Man. It was really neat to see how they tied the two Marvel characters together in what promises to be another great movie in the making. I am anxiously awaiting the next film. So even though you may be wary of this remake give the new 'Incredible Hulk' a chance. It won't disappoint you!",8,4,7,13 June 2008
The Other Boleyn Girl," Kings and Queens
","This movie was so well done and so amazingly castÂ… it left me in total shock and awe! I have read so many terrible reviews about the film, supposedly because the story doesn't follow the book or it wasn't historically accurate. However, it was amazing to me just how accurate it was to actual history. If you look up Anne Boleyn's story you'll find that pretty much everything that she did or went through in the movie really did happen to her during her short life. For example, she really was King Henry's second wife, she really was sent away to live in France for a time, she was not able to bear a son, she was accused of incest and adultery and she was in fact tried for treason and later executed for these supposed crimes. However, they did add some things that weren't historically accurate but that's true of every movie. I still found the movie to be very entertaining even with the added plot. At first I wasn't quite sure if Mary Boleyn even existed because I couldn't find any information on her but from what I've read from other reviews it appears as though she did. That probably would have been too hard to get around if she didn't. In any case it makes the story more real when the people, places and events are all true. It was sad to see how one man took all of the innocence and life from two sisters who once shared such a close, intimate bond. All of the pressure put on them by society and even their own family ultimately cost one sister her life and almost took the other's too. Back then women were treated like cattle or manufacturing machines who, if they didn't produce a male heir, were immediately disposed of just as quickly. It didn't matter if you found favor with the King because eventually you would be replaced by another pretty face eager to do the job. All I can say is props to the women living in the 14th century! Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson were brilliant as the Boleyn sisters. Despite all their plotting and deviousness I was still glad to see that they remained close and were able to forgive each other, right down to the very end. And I loved what Mary said to the King when she was pleading for her sister's life, maybe because I have a little sister of my own. She said, 'Because she is my sister, and therefore one half of me.' So true! Eric Bana fit his role as the King perfectly. He was all of the things that King Henry VIII really was- a chauvinistic, nymphomaniac, sexist pig. He broke so many hearts and took so many lives along the way and all to his own advancement. Men! All in all, this really is a great movie with phenomenal performances. It keeps you guessing 'til the very end!",8,3,6,12 June 2008
The Prestige," Abracadabra!
","What a fantastic, suspenseful, exciting film! This movie kept you on the edge of your sit the entire time. It made you ask yourself questions and second guess yourself. You can't just watch this movie once. You have to watch it again and again to figure out who is who, what they're doing, and why they're doing it. The tag-line on the front cover of the DVD pins it perfectly: 'You want to see it again the second it's over!' I think I've finally got everything figured out now that I've watched it about five times. You learn something new that you missed or didn't see every time you watched it before. But that's why it's so great! Christian Bale is one of my favorite actors and he was phenomenal as the mysterious Alfred Borden. His was the most versatile and dynamic role and he truly made the movie a success. I liked him more as the real Alfred Borden, the one who loved Sarah, rather than his 'twin.' It was just so amazing how he was able to play both different versions of himself simultaneously. Christian Bale is a very talented actor- one of the best. You also see the dark side of Hugh Jackman and honestly I really didn't like his character much. He really lost sight of what was important and just went too far. In the end he was a completely different person, evil almost. The movie had a fair but just ending. And I thought Rebecca Hall also deserves an honorable mention for her small role in the film as Borden's wife. She played a key role in helping to determine exactly which 'Alfred Borden' it was on screen at the time and I thought it was very unique how they did that. All in all, this movie was genius- magical even!",9,4,7,24 January 2008
The Duchess," Noble Debauchery!
","This movie reminded me a great deal of 'The Other Boleyn Girl' in so many ways. As always, Keira Knightley portrays another perfect performance in her latest film. It is a story about life in the 18th century and a young woman, Georgiana, caught in the middle of a treacherous and debauched society. At only eighteen years of age she is given in marriage to the Duke of Devonshire, making her the new Duchess of Devonshire. Her innocence and lust for life were taken away at such an early age, leaving her trapped in a loveless marriage to a pig of a man! She is forced to compromise her beliefs along with all of her dreams, her constant occupation being her husband's obsession to produce a male heir. When she finally does find love with Charles Grey the Duke sees to it that if she abandons her responsibilities she will be parted from her children forever. In the end, she sacrificed everything for her place in a society that gave nothing in return, and instead lost her chance at love, her child, her identity and even her own husband whom she was forced to share with another woman. It was heartbreaking to see how Georgiana Spencer was made to live her life and how unhappy she must have been. Women were treated like manufacturing machines instead of wives and were dealt with such cruelty and disrespect, especially in a time considered to be noble and of the highest stature. All in all, the movie really helped me to appreciate being a woman today with the rights and freedoms that so many never had in times past. It was a look into one woman's fight to just be herself in a world where propriety forced her to be so many things that she wasn't. An excellent portrayal of one woman's place in history.",7,1,2,18 November 2008
Quantum of Solace," Bond is Back!
","Although not as good as the first, this latest Bond is just as good and equally entertaining. Once again Daniel Craig delivers yet another phenomenal performance as the gorgeous and sexy, blue-eyed James Bond. No other actor has truly transformed himself into the role of James Bond as Craig can. He is 'Bond. James Bond!' In 'Quantum' the plot picks right up where 'Casino Royale' left off with 007 searching for the people behind the organization responsible for the death of his love, Vesper. In the beginning Bond is consumed by his grief and allows himself to be guided by his rage and anger. He doesn't care what he does or who he hurts, including himself. In the midst of his ventures he tangles with Camille, a young woman caught in the middle of a conspiracy, behind which is our villain, Dominic Greene and Bolivia's corrupt government officials. Although not a typical 'Bond Girl,' Olga Kurylenko also did a fine job in fulfilling her role in the film. The two had somewhat of a connection, especially noted in that second to last scene. The ending was excellent and quite unexpected, adding to the overall suspense and action of the film. All in all, Bond finally found what he was looking for- answers. It was then that he finally realized too that Vesper did not betray him and that she truly loved him. There was also a hint of a third in this new Bond series. If so, I eagerly await and anticipate its return. A must see!",8,1,6,18 November 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Creatively Curious!
","It's hard for me to describe exactly how I feel about this film. There were parts that made you want to laugh and others that made you cry. It was heartwarming yet heartbreaking all at the same time. The story line is truly one of its kind and unlike any other, both creative and curious. At first I really loved the idea of a person aging backwards but I underestimated what exactly that would mean, like watching everyone you love grow old and die or losing all of your precious memories and forgetting all those years of your life, the people you met along the way and the journeys you made. Still, it was such a beautiful, unique story of life through the eyes of Benjamin Button. Both Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett were phenomenal and made wonderful chemistry together. And it seems as though Brad Pitt gets younger and more good looking with every role! I thought their love story was one of the greats, spanning through decades of time. It was nice to see Julia Ormond back on the big screen too as Caroline, living proof of the love they shared together throughout a lifetime. The make-up in the film is amazing as they take us through the aging process of Benjamin Button. I also thought the scenery to be quite beautiful as well. There were a few scenes that I did not care for because I felt they took away from the film and clouded the story but overall it was a truly great movie. Unfortunately, the ending was a bit sad but tugs at your heartstrings. The film gives you a different perspective on life and ingrains in both your mind and heart that time is precious and that you live your 'life in the moments, not the minutes.'",8,1,2,28 December 2008
The Dark Knight," Batman's Back & Better Than Ever!
","They're back again! I think everyone had high expectations for this film, but this sequel went above and beyond. 'The Dark Knight' was without a doubt the best movie of the year! In a word- riveting! It was equally as good as the first if not better. All of the action and suspense keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire film, from the first scene to the last. It's one you have to see more than once, especially with such an all star cast. As always, Christian Bale plays yet another phenomenal role this second time around as Batman and Heath Ledger's last chilling, yet brilliant performance as 'The Joker' both made the film. He most definitely deserves the Oscar! However, I did not care too much for Maggie Gyllenhaal as the new Rachel Dawes. There was just no chemistry there whatsoever. And you kind of feel bad for Batman too at the end because first the woman he loves chooses someone else after she already basically said that she loved him and then the entire city of Gotham turns on him, forcing him to become 'The Dark Knight.' The film also brought to light so many of the truths about the never ending battle of good vs. evil that so many fight within themselves. All in all, it demanded your full attention and rightly so. No doubt there will be another 'Batman' somewhere in the near future, making it a trilogy that will soar through the box office once again. Entertainment at its best!",10,8,17,21 August 2008
Pride & Prejudice," A Timeless Classic
","This is one of my favorite movies of all time! Jane Austen's renowned romance she penned centuries ago comes to life in this modern day film of 'Pride and Prejudice.' Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy are two of the most complex, yet beloved characters of our time. Director Joe Wright did an outstanding job capturing each romantic moment shared between them, from the very beginning when Darcy first notices Elizabeth in the crowd and every moment after. Even the smallest display of affection was captured beautifully, like the part where Darcy first touches Elizabeth and helps her into the carriage. Although it was only for a moment you could tell how they were both changed from that moment on. Matthew McFadyen is truly amazing and is exactly what Austen's 'Mr. Darcy' should be- tall, rugged, and handsome and a shyness about him that draws you to his character. My favorite part of the entire movie is near the last scene where Darcy is walking toward Elizabeth. There's just something about him in that scene and so many others that tugs on your heartstrings because you can see how much he loves her, and at the same time how afraid he is that she won't love him in return. I can't even explain it really. It gives me goose bumps every time! Keira Knightly's performance was outstanding as well. She has a simple yet elegant sense of beauty and a confidence that makes her great in every role she takes on. The role of Elizabeth Bennet is no easy task. She is strong-willed and prideful, yet gentle and compassionate all at the same time. Keira Kngihtly was the perfect 'Elizabeth.' If you have not gotten the chance to see this new version of 'Pride and Prejudice' I highly recommend that you do. It is the best yet! I will always love this movie!",10,2,6,22 January 2008
The Holiday," A Movie With Gumption!
","This movie definitely has gumption! There is just something about this movie that gets me every time. It just hits so close to home for me. For some reason I always seem to watch it when it's raining or when I'm feeling down or unwanted and confused about love. Everyone has had their share of broken hearts and this is a good movie to watch when you've got one. I have watched it many a times before. Somehow it always manages to leave me with a smile on my face with my hope in love restored once again. And Kate Winslet is so great in this film. Everything she says about love is so true. For example, I love in the beginning how she describes the different kinds of love there are, how easily love can fade or be lost or even unreturned. And I almost cry every time during the scene when she's explaining how broken a person's heart can be, but then she says too that eventually all that fades and you move on because you really do. It's just a great pick me up for when you're feeling blue and alone in the love department. The cast was also well chosen and fit the story line perfectly. Jude Law and Cameron Diaz were great together and I also thought that Jack Black did a nice job as well. Normally I don't really care for him and his type of humor but he really pulled his character off nicely. He had a subtle, yet caring and sweet kind of humor that added a great deal to the film. All in all, 'The Holiday' is a great movie to put in whenever you want answers to all of the hard questions about love or when you just feel like 'vacating' your life for a while. It's a good remedy for a broken heart because it comes from the heart.",8,2,4,21 June 2008
Atonement," A Love That Endures All!
","There are not enough words to describe how truly amazing this movie is! It was exceptional and most definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen. Every scene is breathtaking. The director really brought McEwan's words alive and stayed true to his story. You are taken into the mind of young Briony Tallis whose innocence, imagination and childhood fantasies changes the lives of everyone around her. With one simple lie, one small accusation, she destroys the lives of the two people she cares for the most. James McAvoy and Keira Knightley were in a league entirely of their own. Their performances as Robbie Turner and Cecilia Tallis were phenomenal. They had that spark and that chemistry that really make the movie what it is. But I must say that James McAvoy was both the lead role and star of the film. I love him in every movie he's ever been a part of! As an actor he possesses the talent and ability to invoke emotion in you from every scene. He can make you laugh one minute and cry the next. He is truly talented. Some of the most powerful scenes are when he is in the war just trying to make it back to the woman he loves and thinking about her every step of his journey. The scene where he comes across a field of dead school children and begins to cry was very moving. And then there's the scene where's he's just lying there at night looking at the picture of the cottage until the match goes out, wanting so much to be home there with her. That was another tear jerker! One of my favorite scenes too was right after Cecilia comes up from the water and grabs the broken vase out of his hand and he just watches her walk away and then he goes over to the fountain and lays his hand on top of the water, just to be close to her. That was another really beautiful scene. But what I loved the most was how much they both loved each other and all he wanted to do was just get back to her so that they could be together and I hate that they never got that chance. The ending truly shocked me. I really thought that everything was going to turn out the way it was supposed to and that Briony would change her testimony and he would finally be cleared of any shame or reproach that he suffered because of her. And I really thought they were going to get married and live happily ever after because they so rightly deserved a happy ending. Then come to find out that Briony never had the courage or the decency to go and see her sister that day to try and make things right. Her character irritated me so much, not just because she lied but because she was a coward and she ruined two people's lives without cause or reason. She could have fixed what she'd done but she chose not to. She only wrote that last book at the end because of her guilty conscience but even then what she did all those years ago was still unforgivable. Still, I'm glad that despite all the odds that were against them they got a chance to see each other that one time in the cafÃ©, and despite it all they still loved each other all the same- maybe more even. However, even as evil as it sounds, I am glad that they both died in the end so that one didn't have to suffer all the pain and heartache alone and go through life without the other. I did like the very last scene too. It gave you a sense of closure and was exactly how it should really have been. All in all, 'Atonement' is a love story and one that stands the test of time and endures a lie, the horrors of war and even death. It was heartbreaking, but then again most great love stories usually are.",10,5,9,6 April 2008
