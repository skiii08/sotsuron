Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Much better than I expected
","I went to this film expecting to be disappointed due to the critics rather cool reception.I was pleasantly surprised to find it very engrossing. It is visually stunning: The costumes, sets, all wonderful. I didn't want to leave so as not to miss anything.  My Indicator of a fun film.  The characters were a bit thin, as others have pointed out, but there is enough to grab on to without it being too long a film. I'm going back to see more.Don't miss it on the screen, it is a work of art.",7,0,0,31 May 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Flawless
","I was moved to tears for three hours to see the book I loved so years ago done with such perfection.  I was so worried that they would muck it up. The screenplay is beyond excellent.  They pare it down for film and even enhance characters, Sauramn the White for one, with real genius. All performances were top rate......Shaun Austin particularly surprised me. Epic myth retold as I think JRR would approve.",10,0,0,24 December 2001
