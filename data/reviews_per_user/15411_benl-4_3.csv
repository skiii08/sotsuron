Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The whole audience laughed in horror
","What to say about Borat? It is a hilarious expose of racial, religious and social prejudices that had the whole audience laughing in horror... I saw Borat at a Toronto International Film Festival Press and Industry screening, I gather that at the premier the previous night Sasha Baron Cohen arrived on a cart with a donkey beside him and 'peasant women' pulling it. My God!I had to sit in the very front row for this film which was made scanning the occasional subtitles a bit tough. This isn't giving much away, but there were some scenes that you didn't want to be that close to the screen...",7,6,22,8 September 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Provocative and Beautiful
","Ang Lee has created some amazing films, and this is another. A covert gay relationship between taciturn cowboys is a provocative subject, but I felt that the film handled it well and gave an illuminating look at the subject of homophobia. Brokeback Mountain was filmed in Alberta's Rocky Mountains and I spend part of my career as a geologist in that region. It gave me chills seeing an approximation of my old life in the outdoors up on the big screen.Brokeback Mountain was beautifully filmed with powerful performances by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal as ranch hands Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist. I noticed that the sets of actors playing Ennis' growing daughters were particularly well cast too. To me the tale boiled down to Ennis and Jack being caught by a desire they couldn't acknowledge and a choice they couldn't make. The film captures the tragic consequences; Ennis pushing away everyone that loves him and Jack's unfulfilled but agonizing need.",9,12,13,25 January 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Excellent effects, lousy film
","There's no question Lucasfilms has the technical smarts to create any special effect imaginable. Too bad all they could do was cobble together the most idiotic vehicles and improbable landscapes ever assembled. The plot was predictable and unsophisticated, which made the storm of visual effects even more annoying.Not all is lost though. The actors performed their roles well, and the plot managed to make the necessary connection to the 'first' film.The overall feeling I got from Revenge of the Sith was of watching money being spent as quickly as possible. As an exercise in graphic art Revenge of the Sith is entertaining, but as a film it is a waste of rendering time.",3,11,19,6 June 2005
