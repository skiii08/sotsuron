The Expendables 2," The joke is on us
","I really like the negative reviews here. People, these guys made millions by playing the same roles in movies where they were doing stuff that was totally unrealistic. Now they are having a laugh about that doing exactly the same. Just think Tarentino made this one if it makes you feel better. This one has more Reservoir Dogs in it than anything Tarentino did after that.Go watch live leak if you want realistic action, this is escapism at it's best.Yes, the 'jokes' are lame, they are meant to be. Yes, the dialog is over the top(wink wink, nudge nudge), it is meant to be. Yes, most of these guys are older than your dads, they can still seem to kick ass (it doesn't take much to shoot a 1000 other actors). This is action porn, does anybody complain about the dialog in a skin flick? Or it's plausibility in real live? These are some actors having a good time and making an easy buck, don't take it too seriously! I loved it. Too much story I thought and I think they should have had each player only use lines from previous movies. But they can always do that in number three. I hope they bring Mad Max and Snake Plisken in for that one!",9,0,0,19 October 2012
Skyfall," Deus ex machina tutorial
","A deus ex machina (Latin: 'god from the machine') is a plot device whereby a seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly and abruptly solved with the contrived and unexpected intervention of some new event, character, ability, or object. Depending on usage, it can be used to move the story forward when the writer has 'painted themselves into a corner' and sees no other way out, to surprise the audience, or to bring a happy ending into the tale.In Skyfall's case it is also about the only plot device used. The team of nitwits that wrote this script should never be allowed near a computer again ever.If the really stupid super-criminal had kidnapped and tortured M like he was tortured because of M, with JB on a revenge mission, the story might have worked. The way it has been done now was just polishing a turd.",4,7,16,13 January 2013
World War Z," They must have a lot of healthy people in the US
","Sick people are immune to zombie aggression. And it takes a retired hipster UN investigator to find this out (because he is really good at running away). Wow, who sold this brilliant, not in the book, plot-piece to the studio? I guess there are no HIV-positive communities in New York and all those hospitals filled with only normal patients and zombie doctors and nurses.The rest of the story is also for the brain dead. The hipster doesn't communicate his results but does call his wife. Like a true James Bond kinda guy there is always an evil dude around to tell you part of his evil plan. A few people singing behind a 30 meter high wall(who just wandered out of a totally zombie infested area)are too loud but helicopters flying over the area are not. Zombies have anti-gravity booths to climb the wall or wolverine-like skeletons because having 20 zombies on top is just fine for them (but shooting knees works fine). Somehow it is more efficient to transfer 4 people 4000 miles than it is to let them keep their small cabin, the captain of a jet carrier says so after hipster dude goes missing for 1 day. Aaaaarghh, it just doesn't make any sense. Like making a zombie movie without zombies and gore but with at least 45 minutes of totally useless family dribble. Voice over: 'I'm hipster dude, I love my family. To protect them I'm on this mission.' Images from the outbreak while the voice over plays. Ending with annoying daughters waving on the flight deck. That could have saved a good 40 minutes of boredom for me. This movie is really very bad. Just watch the trailer 2 times, you won't miss a thing.",2,4,9,29 July 2013
Man of Steel," Ennio Morricone weeps
","Man, that was some annoying soundtrack. Did they have a computer program it? Explosions and orchestra don't make a good movie. A good writer, director and composer do. This ranks among the new star wars as being too much bang without any soul. People who like this should just buy a xbox or playstation and play some fps. Better storyline for sure.Russell shoots ten guys but lets the bad dude stab him? Repeat.Cut to Deadliest catch (sheeple like that, let's put that in), an oil- rig is burning: 'What about the men left inside?' 'Forget them, they are dead.' And then they land a helicopter on the burning platform, enter superman. Is this whole movie filled with retards? Yes, it is. It is also made by them.Alternative: Russell:'Sure, I'll join your well timed rebellion. I hate these geriatrics too. Wait a sec while I get my super-duper armour from home. Don't forget to shoot the rest of these old dudes and get me some nachos. The planet will be fine. Don't worry.' Gets a few babies and the skull thingy, flies to earth with his wife and future girlfriends for his kid. The end. Better than the northville cemetery massacre but that is about it.",2,16,31,4 July 2013
