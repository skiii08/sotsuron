Iron Man 3," Not without flaws but still a hugely entertaining ride.
","**Spoilers**I'll dive right in and start by addressing the obvious elephant in the room by which I mean Iron Man 3's many questionable plot points and outright flaws. Following on from 2012's stunning dream team-up The Avengers, Iron Man 3 had the unenviable task of picking up the pieces and going solo again. My first nitpick is Tony Stark's PTSD regarding his flight through a wormhole above New York. A man who has an innate ability to predict the future (for aside from his mechanical genius that is Stark's 'power') would surely be well equipped mentally to cope with the revelation that aliens are indeed out there. His breakdown due to this one factor is something that doesn't smack of the comic book Tony Stark. I simply don't buy his anguish. Another jarring choice is the difference between pre-Extremis Killian and his super- powered version. A more subtle physical performance for the pre-enhanced version would have been preferred from Guy Pearce. And whilst on the subject, the level of power that Extremis gives its subjects is pushed just too far. Rapid regeneration and the ability to heat up to 1,000s of degrees is just taking things too far to remain wholly believable. These guys make the T-1000 look tame. A little more restraint is all I'm asking. Another nitpick is the last line which was changed from the scripted one. One of the film's better ideas is taking Tony Stark and stripping him of his suits but even without them he's still a guy who can make something out of nothing and survive, he still is Tony Stark yet the closing line of 'I am Iron Man' as opposed to the original line of 'I am Tony Stark' is a bizarre choice and in a way prevents Tony's story arc coming full circle. These are personal nitpicks and some may see other major plot points as flaws and whereas I once did, I've now come to appreciate some of Shane Black's more bold choices. So let's deal with the main one, The Mandarin. Whilst I was with the majority initially and hated the big twist now I see it as a stroke of genius and very brave writing. Killian himself addresses the matter when he says, 'You simply rule from behind the scenes. Because the second you give evil a face, a Bin- Laden, a Gaddafi, The Mandarin, you hand people a target.' It's all there in that one line, The Mandarin was the ultimate decoy. And let's be honest about the Mandarin from the comics, he's an outdated Fu-Manchu racial stereotype that borders on being offensive. And let's not take any credit away from Sir Ben, as both The Mandarin and Trevor Slattery he's just pure entertainment. What IM3 gets right it does so with aplomb. The film's humour is spot-on most of the time and typical of a Shane Black film. The three main action scenes (there are lots more besides) are a masterclass in frenetic, well staged and jaw-dropping action. The helicopter attack on the Malibu house is superb and the Air Force One skydiving rescue scene is phenomenal and one of the greatest set-pieces I've ever seen, the majority of it filmed for real with only minor CG enhancements. The final House Party Protocol battle is the stuff of fanboy dreams and is wholly satisfying. Apart from Tony then blowing up all his suits that is. Bum move Stark, you might need those soon!So in summary it's a film that fires along at a cracking pace and thoroughly entertains if you can ignore some of its more questionable plot choices. For me it's the most entertaining of the three Iron Man films and one that I initially disliked but have now grown to love. It stands up to repeat viewings as much as any of the best MCU films. I still lament Marvel's avoidance of some the darker elements from the books relating to Stark's alcoholism which would give RDJ an opportunity to really stretch his acting muscles and give extra depth to the character. The film's mis-steps are often significant and have irked many a hardcore Marvel fan but they're mostly forgivable when you take into account just how very high those many high points are.",8,15,23,25 July 2015
The Terminator," An Undisputed Classic Film (Tech) Noir.
","*Possible Spoilers*The fact that James Cameron's low budget 1984 breakthrough film, The Terminator is an undisputed classic of 80's cinema and cinema in general is just that, undisputed. It is however, one of a handful of first films that may be bettered by its sequel, in this case Cameron's 1991 epic, big budget follow up, Terminator 2: Judgement Day. For me the second film had always been my favourite of the two (I try to ignore the rest) but on re- watching the original recently I have a renewed love of the film. It's grittiness and dark tone, devoid of humour is very refreshing in this sanitised PG-13 age of Hollywood that we now live in. Arnold Schwarzenegger is unrelentingly menacing as the titular killer cyborg from the future and it's a stunningly well paced film. It's very much a product of the 80's with its garish fashion and big hair but that's in no way a bad thing as it's setting is very much an integral part of the plot. T2 is grander, more epic and still near flawless but I fear it suffers from too much exposure if there can be such a thing. It's been on TV a million times and released more times on various home video formats than almost any other film and is maybe a little too much in the public lexicon to be viewed outside of itself and it's own reputation. The original has a lower budget feel that gives it an almost indie quality that has done it no such harm. Set over the course of two days and nights there is a greater sense of intimacy with the first film and a dark tone that's very film noir (or should that be Tech Noir?). Schwarzenegger, in only his second major role, has only a handful of lines but commands the screen with a presence that sets him apart as one of cinemas truly frightening villains. When you consider that both OJ Simpson and Lance Henriksen had been considered for the role prior to the Austrian Oak it's lucky that Cameron made such an inspired casting decision and it would be interesting to peer into an alternate universe and see what the other two actors would have brought to the role. Linda Hamilton shines as Sarah Connor, the T-800's timid, shell-shocked target and by film's end it's great to see her transition into something that more closely resembles (at least mentally) T2's ripped killing machine mom. Michael Biehn also gives a superb, understated performance as the battle-weary human soldier sent back to protect Sarah. The sense of impending doom he conveys whilst never straying from his mission adds immensely to the film's pre-post-apocalyptic theme. There are many great plot devices and technical flourishes that I could mention such as the idea that Kyle is the father of the man that sent him back to the past in the first place, a mind bending temporal causality loop that gives food for thought and debate. On the technical front the cinematography, iconic score and soundtrack and tight editing are all first rate. One particular scene representative of these aspects so finely melded by Cameron's deft hand is the scene where Sarah and the Terminator first meet. As the cyborg walks through the Tech Noir nightclub and approaches the table where Sarah sits waiting for the arrival of the LAPD, the film shifts into a dreamlike slow motion as Sarah knocks a bottle onto the floor, bends down to pick it up just long enough for the T-800 to miss her as he passes. The 80's rock music is now muffled by the dilation of time as the score comes in, Sarah gets up and sees not the cyborg but Kyle staring at her from across the bar oblivious to the fact that her hunter has now doubled back and is about to see her. Just as the slo-mo tension reaches a climax Kyle sees what Sarah hasn't as she lifts her gaze to the machine as he pulls out a gun, Kyle does the same and we kick back into real-time and all hell breaks loose. This level of tension is maintained for the film's duration and marks it as one of cinema's most efficient thrillers. We've since seen what Cameron can do with huge budgets and established effects houses and there's no denying that he's more than made his mark on the movie world. However, one can't help but think that ever since he declared himself King of the World, his films, quality wise at least, have diminished. I still lean towards T2 as the more personally fulfilling entertainment spectacle of the two films but back in 1984 with very real limitations made worse by on-set woes, problems with studio heads and the lack of any prior reputation, Cameron made best of what he had and that estimated $6.4 million budget was stretched further than anyone could have imagined. He ended up giving us a classic film of such quality that it made sure that the audience, like the Terminator himself, would indeed be back.",10,5,6,12 April 2014
The Princess Bride," Utterly woeful.
","I last saw The Princess Bride around 20+ years ago. I can't recall what I thought of it then but I have always been aware that it has a great following. Having just re-watched it I am utterly dismayed that a film this poorly written, so poorly acted and with such a jarring almost absurdly bad musical score has such devotion. I can only guess that it's nostalgia that's clouding the minds of its fans. It's not even remotely funny and this coming from the guy that gave us This Is Spinal Tap? The sets look worse than the cheapest TV shows. It even makes reference to Australia being full if convicts yet has a Medieval period setting, hundreds of years before Autralia's convict influx. Did nobody vet the script? Where's the alleged humour? Please give me a funny line that I may have missed. This is woefully amateurish stuff.",2,12,31,1 March 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," How does Marvel keep doing this?
","By 'this' I mean taking Marvel properties that aren't mainstream even by comic book standards and turning them into massively successful films. As part of Marvel Studios boss, Kevin Feige's Marvel Cinematic Universe master-plan they've taken characters like Thor and made them work successfully on the big screen and have recently done it again with a man who shrinks to the size of an ant. Such bold adaptations should never have worked but credit to Marvel they've nailed it several times now. Few would argue that of Marvel's lesser properties that have been added to the MCU mixing pot, Guardians of the Galaxy is by far the most surprisingly successful adaptation. One of Marvel's more 'out there' (literally) properties, GotG was a big gamble and the lion's share of credit must go to director James Gunn who made the film very much his own. Colourful, subversively funny and achingly cool in equal measure, GotG blew cinema goers away with its infectious feel-good factor and brilliantly realised team of disparate losers. The script is the first and arguably most important thing that they got right. The consistently sharp and witty dialogue keeps your attention throughout and none of the main cast feel superficial or poorly written. Chris Pratt almost steals the show with his portrayal of Star Lord and walks a fine line between making the character his own and falling into shameless Han Solo parody. Even the non-human CGI characters like Rocket and Groot are given a satisfying depth and what makes everything gel is the emotional heft that pervades throughout, be it Star Lord's grief over the loss of his mother or Rocket lamenting his tortured creation. Even wrestler Dave Bautista delivers as the dryly serious Drax who takes every verbal witticism by its literal meaning providing many of the film's funniest moments. Yes, main villain Ronan the Accuser is somewhat thinly written with an almost generic genocidal drive to wipe out his people, The Kree's enemies but Lee Pace makes up for it somewhat with a commanding physical screen presence. Karen Gillian's strangely sexy, chameleon-like turn as Nebula is far stronger. Watch her express just enough mournful regret in her expression after seemingly killing her adopted sister Gamora to give the scene an added emotional layer. It's a beautiful moment in a film packed full of them. Indeed what Guardians does well is take time for those little moments of awe inspiring beauty like Groot's light spores and his moving 'WE are Groot' heroic sacrifice. No review of Guardians would be complete without mention of the astonishing soundtrack. The song choices are both fitting and relevant to Quill and are actually being heard by our characters as the scenes play. This helps pull us into Guardians trippy space opera and coupled with a rousing musical score Guardians is a treat on the ears as well as the eyes. From the surprisingly emotional 1988 set prologue to the über cool opening through to the musical montage ending the film whips along at a satisfying pace and not a scene or line of dialogue is wasted. The action is stunningly well executed and avoids the confusing Transformers-esque level of incoherent mayhem that pollute many modern summer blockbusters. So 10/10, really? Well having watched it several times now I can't see where it puts a foot majorly wrong. It accomplishes all it sets out to do and more. It has enough depth to make repeat viewings rewarding and offers sufficient, technically flawless eye candy to never get boring. Indeed all of the $170 million budget is up there on screen plain to see and in terms of quality it's a film more than worthy of its financial success. And all this from a film that the majority of Marvel fans never really wanted or expected in the first place. Going back to both the soundtrack and the film's pervading feel good factor, it's these two things working in tandem that are arguably the most memorable aspect of Guardians. A great meal is only as good as the last mouthful and by the end of Guardians' veritable feast you've been thoroughly entertained and emotionally satisfied and what else can you ask of a space-themed Summer sci-fi blockbuster? The wait for their return to the big screen won't be an easy one and that's credit to what an amazing achievement James Gunn has made. He took what could've been seen as a Star Wars rip-off featuring a talking racoon, a man-tree and Han Solo and Malcolm Reynolds' love-child and somehow made it all work. Yeah, that gets a 10 in my book.",10,2,5,24 July 2015
