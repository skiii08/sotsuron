The Ring," Great movie, possibly one of the best remakes i've ever seen.
","Let me start off saying that Ringu (original japanese version) itself was a great movie.  It was very original in plot and suspense.  I was fortunate to see Ringu before being blessed with a prescreening.The Ring is a GREAT movie.  The beginning one thinks is slow at first, but then thats for about three minutes.  The movie's story differs from that of the Japanese version in many ways, mainly because every other person in the original was a psychic; that wouldn't fly with the American audience much.   Despite changes in the story they have kept the drama and expanded parts in the original to really freak you out.  I just hope they don't change much in the two weeks before the movie comes out.I like this movie because at both times they were subtle things to scare ya, you didn't get to see too much, but then what you did see gave you the creeps. I slept well with Ringu and The Ring, but my friends had a hard time sleeping with The Ring.  Highly recommended.",Null,0,0,4 October 2002
