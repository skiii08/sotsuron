Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Something to remind me of spirituality
","In so many ways this film symbolizes the struggle between our governments and our religions. It is incredible. Every detail, every painting was flawless. You must see this movie with child's mind, you must take a break from your everyday duties and understand the immense message that Lucas is bestowing on us. Our culture is once again different.",10,0,0,21 May 1999
Shine," For Every human being...
","there is a special place that one discovers the true meaning of creativity. This film captures the great imagination of some of the most highly artistic individuals in the world, their struggle, their fight for recognition, and their fight for anything but failure. I was truly mesmerized by the fact that they used Rachmaninoff's 3rd instead of the immensely popular 2nd concerto. This movie was not made for the general mass, but to see it is to have a moment of your own creativity.",Null,0,0,2 July 1999
The Godfather," The Struggle of One Man
","If you haven't seen this movie, then you're missing a part of American history. Open your eyes to one man's struggle against the many, while he tries to keep his family and a promise to his father. If you have a close relationship with your father I highly recommend this film. If you don't, I highly recommend this film.",Null,0,1,2 July 1999
