The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," I Thought It Was Just Fine
","Not sure what all the complaining is about. I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I put it on at least the same level as Catching Fire and maybe a little higher. It was somewhat of a relief not to have to go back to the arena (which I felt both times that Katniss got off easy not having to murder close friends and allies to survive). Having heard that it was short on action, I was satisfied that it had a decent balance between action, drama, and plot progression. I had a few bones to pick along the way, mainly about scenes that seemed overly dramatic and tried a little too hard to pull at the viewers heartstrings, but overall, came away satisfied. I give it an 8 of 10.",8,5,24,2 December 2014
Captain Marvel," Great Movie
","Really, can't see what all the whining is about. This was a wonderful movie. Brie Larsen was cute, clever, funny, warm, friendly and kick ass awesome, all at the proper moments. One of the better Marvel Movies for me. Kept waiting for her to become the cold, heartless, threatening woman the viewer reviews are complaining about and it didn't happen. The whole cast, in fact, did an amazing job. If there was a weak moment for me, it was near the end of the movie after her potential powers have been revealed, and the writers, director, whoever tried the amateur gimmick of making her look vulnerable and 'at risk' several times--pretty pathetic guys. Can't put the Genie back in the bottle once she's out. Much as I love Gal Gaidot in almost anything, I personally have to give this Captain Marvel a slight edge over Wonder Woman for the favorite female superhero movie (and tied with Alita B A). 8.5 (rounded to a 9) of 10 for the awesome Captain Marvel.If you want to compare it to Wonder Woman ( and I love Gal Gaidot in almost everything) I would put Captain Marvel slightly ahead, say an 8.5 compared to an 8.",9,1,6,8 March 2019
Ready Player One," I Was Warned
","Yes, I read the reviews saying, if you read the book don't go see the movie. But I've been waiting for this movie for 6 years--I had to go see it. And yes I found it disappointing. They changed the story a lot. They left out a lot of the actual challenges that it took to find and win a key. They eliminated a good bit of the clever maneuvering it took to outwit the evil corporate bullies. They ignored most of the nostalgia that made the book so charming. (Yes I owned an Atari 2600, a Commodore computer, and played the arcade games and pinball machines). The question that always bothers me is: if someone wrote a book that, out of thousands published, had just the right ingredients to be a best seller--why would you take the risk of changing it? What difference will it make to the people who haven't read it? None. what difference will it make to the millions of people who read and fell in love with the book, a lot. Where I would have probably gone back and seen the movie 2 or 3 times in the theater in both standard and 3D, I won't waste my time and money now. Where I would have bought the movie on DVD or Bluray to have and to keep, I won't do that either. (I may rent it eventually just to confirm it really was as disappointing as it felt in the theater). Where I would have given it a high rating and written a positive review and urged people to go see it--I won't. If millions of book fans feel the same way that's potentially a lot of lost revenue. Of course if the movie makes a decent amount of money, it will still be a win for the director and the studio regardless of what it could have been. The book fans are the people who promoted this story to level of being movie worthy. Too bad we got crapped on.",5,0,2,2 April 2018
Pacific Rim," It Was As Good As They Say It Is
",Outstanding movie. Only thing wrong was the small crowd in the theater made people a little shy to stand up and cheer for the good guys. It was a stand up and cheer movie. Good old basic us vs them plot. Excellent monster aliens. Funtastic monster robots. Impressive CGI fight scenes (in which they avoided using the usual trick of speeding up the action so they can get by with less fine detail). Likable characters which we want to win. The women can kick butt just like the guys. Avoided cluttering up the central action with a clumsy love story.Upgrading those old Gozilla stop action monsters was way long overdue. Thank you guys for not screwing it up. This was an excellent movie. Go see it.,9,3,9,18 July 2013
Oblivion," I Can't Wait for the DVD
","One of my favorite movies in a long time. Visually stunning. Clever gadgets. A couple of neat twists. A love story that actually goes beyond the usual kissing and rolling in bed. A sort of bi-level story line--that either makes the whole movie look like one big plot hole or else leads you down a curious trail of what-ifs and oh-I-get-its and did the writer imagine this or am I making it up. (Which thread will you follow?). You have to pay attention or you will miss important points, which I note from the reviews and message boards--a lot of people, including the professional critics, did. Even though I don't consider myself a big Tom Cruise fan--I can't imagine anyone else doing a better job in this role. Olga Kurylenko was to die for. Morgan Freeman doing what he does best. I can't wait for the DVD, so I can watch it again and again and again........",9,1,3,18 July 2013
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Too Slow
","I'll admit I'm not a big animation fan. No matter how good it is, it's still a cartoon. At least Pixar type movies don't give me the impression they are skipping frames to save money. Even worse, I found the first half slow--as in nodding off slow--and this was at 10 in the morning. The second half was better. Can't really see any universe in which this would be a 10 of 10. I give it a 6.5 of 10.",6,2,10,2 February 2019
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Surprisingly Inspiring
","Every once in a while a movie gives me a real feeling of well being. I leave the theater feeling stronger, calmer, happier, more in tune with life. The sunshine seems a little brighter. Annoying people don't annoy me. I feel like I could maybe conquer dragons--little ones. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was one of these movies and I'm not entirely sure why. On the surface it's a fairly simple, predictable, slightly over-the-top, feel good, made-for-TV type movie. But for several brief moments here and there I thought of all of those people who live decent, competent, unremarkable lives and must at some point look back and wonder what they have accomplished. Perhaps they have unknowingly made the lives of a number of their fellow human beings better--which is no small task in itself. For the few of those who have not only done that but managed to rise above their hum-drum existence for a brief and shining moment as well--hurray for you!!!The cinematography was wonderful. The scenes in Iceland and Greenland and the Himalayas were cool and amazing. The music was inspiring (the music didn't just enhance the movie--the movie seemed to enhanced the music). I have never been a big fan of Ben Stiller or Sean Penn, but after this movie I am finally pleased with both. Good job guys. If it tells you anything--some people sat thru the credits to the end. When is the last time that happened in a movie you saw?Not a perfect movie. Drags a little bit here and there. Maybe a little too ridiculous at times. Maybe a little too sappy here and there. But in the end it's what dreams are all about aren't they--getting a little bit more than we expected-- and maybe sometimes, getting it all?",8,2,5,17 January 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Pretty much as Good as The First
","I'm not sure what all the whining is about. It's true the opening CGI scenes were pretty awful (like in almost stop-motion unrealistic), and I was like 'Aw, Man!', but once past that it shaped up pretty nicely. I've also heard complaints about too much comedy and one liners--which there were quite a few, but frankly I thought they were pretty funny and not over done. The main thing the first Avengers had over this one is that the first was 'surprisingly' good and the second is good but we've already had the surprisingly. It would have had to have been something really special to out-do the first. Considering what a disaster a lot of sequels are--we should be grateful. My only other complaint was that the CGI fight scenes suffered from Transformerization--where they apparently run the action really fast so they don't have to do a lot of really time consuming, realistic detail. Maybe they could just make them shorter, slower and more clear. Huh? Anyway I recommend it with 8 stars.",8,1,4,12 May 2015
Elysium," Even the Bad Humans can be Better than the Good Ones?
","This was an excellent movie in my book. Enjoyed the Sci-Fi action adventure (no slow spots for me). Enjoyed the great visual effects and the fun high techy stuff . Enjoyed the intertwining human interest stories. Enjoyed the love stories-- both the kind where people risk their lives for those they specifically love, and for those they don't even know as well. I enjoyed the mix of humanity--wherein the good people were good and some of the bad people were really bad, but then there were the not so good who turned out to be some of the best of all. A real showcase of the human spirit. I found Neill Blomkamp's District 9 slightly disappointing compared to the reviews, but was relieved to find I liked Elysium better than expected.Maybe no major new ground broken here but for me a solid fun movie, and a generally uplifting experience. I say go see it.",8,0,2,16 August 2013
Les Mis√©rables," mor miserab than anticipated
","The idea of a story being told by people singing to each other is rather silly on the surface, but it can work amazingly well with beautiful/soulful or catchy music and an engaging story. I watched Les Miserables mostly on the strength of the reviews and found it perfectly awful. The story was so so, the acting was blah, and the singing was cringworthy. Producers of musicals tend to cast singers who can also act to some degree because a 'musical' mostly relies on the music. Here we have decent actors who can't sing and consequently seem out of their comfort zone in the acting department as well . Listening to them struggle thru their various songs was more tortuous than watching the terrible injustices their characters were living out in the story. I've seen high school musicals with more impressive talent and with a far more engaging production. A sympathetic 5 out 10 stars for this waste of 2 hours.",5,0,2,26 March 2018
Lucy," Writing and Directing Could have Benefittted from Brain Enhancement
","For me this movie failed to deliver on several levels. It was neither as smart and slick as the brain enhancement movie Limitless nor as in-your- face kick-butt, (and slick) as Resident Evil's superbabe Alice. The opening scenes in which Lucy is being coerced by her loser boyfriend into making a questionable delivery, becomes annoying and tedious instead of building tension. The director uses cutaway scenes to wild animals stalking their prey to (hint, hint, nudge, nudge) suggest what is fixing to happen to Lucy--as if we couldn't figure that out for ourselves. Even the scenes in which our superbad drug lord forces Lucy to be a mule for his high tech drugs were slow and unconvincing. Morgan Freeman's brain utilization lectures were long-drawn and unimpressive as well. For such a short movie, there was a lot of waiting-to-get-on-with-it moments.That being said, if you can make it through the slow, uninspiring beginnings, the movie does improve after Lucy's brain enhancement begins. For a 3:00 matin√©e showing the theater was surprisingly crowded, and the movie did manage to elicit a number of chuckles and laugh out loud reactions from the audience. There was a lot of whispered discussion going on as well, so maybe others were finding the movie more enjoyable than I. I found the subject matter intriguing but the delivery lacking focus and direction. See it if you have nothing better to do, but I recommend seeing it without great expectation. I give it a 6 out of 10. Could have (and should have)been much better.",6,2,13,31 July 2014
Life," How Much Does It Cost to Show A Movie?
","I remember when I walked out of the theater after watching Alien, my stomach hurt from 2 hours of gut wrenching tension and horror. When I walked out of the theater after watching Life, I was wondering if 5 viewers at $3.24 each, who didn't buy popcorn or drinks, would pay for the cost of showing the movie. It really frightens me that if this theater goes out of business I'll have to pay regular admission prices to watch first run movies. Oh yeah, the movie: Life was a pretty decent looking movie, with realistic CGI and props. Most of the characters were actually fairly engaging and relate-able. But I recognized 'scary alien lifeform creature' almost immediately--he's the starfish guy from Spongbob Squarepants in his first real life, big blockbuster, serious sci-fi movie roll. AND because he was inexperienced and only 100% brain and 100% muscle they had to help him out by using the time honored scary movie trick of having his victims do stupid, foolish and illogical things and by letting him defy the laws of physics. Bring your eyeballs and your sympathy, but leave your brains at home. 6 of 10 for spending a lot of money on special effects and cast.",6,1,3,30 March 2017
