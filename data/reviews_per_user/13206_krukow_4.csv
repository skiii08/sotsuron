The Blair Witch Project," Damn The Hype
","I purposely waited until PPV, because the media madness over this film was so overwhelming. Unfortunately you can't filter out all of it and some of it crept in. I half expected to see a somewhat noteworthy film, instead I was pretty disappointed and only thankful the film was short. I know I would have liked it more if I hadn't known anything, (or much) before going in.",6,0,1,13 December 1999
Saturday Night Fever," A blast from the past
","I was a senior in high school when this film first came out, I didn't pay too much attention to it because 'Vinnie Barbarino' was in it and the only real cool part of it was of course the tunes. A couple nights ago on HBO they were showing it, so I decided to sit down and see what I had missed. I found out, I missed a compelling story of a young man just going with the crowd when it finally dawns on him to go for his dreams. And of course the disco beat still had me hopping. I certainly wished I would have paid more attention when I was young and it would have done me some good.",7,0,1,1 October 1999
American History X," I've seen this movie twice
","and I'll see it again when it comes around. Before I saw this film the first time I had all ready told myself I wasn't going to like it. The company that made this movie completely mis-marketed this (just like Fight Club - but that's a different story), it was quite different than what I had envisioned and in turn made me think of this skinhead as a person and as a sympathetic character, credit Edward Norton's great acting. Myself being a black woman, this is quite a concept for me to admit. Seeing it again helped me formulate the opinion that all though it is flawed in some ways -  it seems that it is missing some scenes, like what else happened to Derek in prison his last few months and just who in the heck is this Cameron? (nice job with the make-up, I hardly recognized Stacey Keach) It has a an undeniable message that everyone should hear. Oh yeah, it was cool seeing Jennifer Lien as Derek's sister, Davina, in a post Star Trek Voyager role.",9,0,0,4 November 1999
The Matrix," Best SciFi Flick This Decade
","Now I've seen this film 3 times and each time I learn and understand more about it. I don't know why it captures me so. It makes me think about the world we live in and our place in it. The creators have imagined a totally plausible alternate plane of existence that these characters exist in and makes you wonder if we are all being pulled by some invisible strings. I for one liked Keanu Reeves performance, it needed to be understated because of what is about to be thrust upon him. The special EFX are outstanding and Carrie-Ann Moss is out of this world (Cool leather duds). I will be watching this film again and I can't wait for Matrix 2.",10,0,0,15 November 1999
