Casablanca," Casablanca
","I didn't like this movie as much as I thought I would. I was a little bit confused at times about who was who, what they wanted, where they were from, and where they wanted to go. Casablanca is about a man from America named Rick who owns a very popular nightclub in Casablanca, a town full of people from all over the place trying to get to America but it's not that easy because World War II was going on. The beginning of the movie involves the police rounding up suspects who might have possession of letters of transit because they were stolen after the murder of two German officials. The letters of transit allowed whoever had them to travel freely which would make it easy for whoever had them to get to America. Rick met a girl, Ilsa, while he was in Paris before he came to Casablanca who he really loved and she planned to run away with him but when Rick went to leave she was nowhere to be found. One night Ilsa and her husband showed up at Rick's café. He was shocked, he thought he would never see her again. Rick was tipped of that she was there when the piano player at his café started to play a song that he told him never to play but Ilsa requested it. Ilsa needs the letters to get to America but Rick didn't give them to her at first. She then held a gun to him and demanded he give her the letters and when she didn't shoot him she admitted that she still loved him and that when they meet in Paris she thought her husband died at a concentration camp. However, she found out he was actually alive and that was why she didn't go with Rick that morning and didn't give him any explanation. At the end, it seemed like Ilsa was going to stay with Rick but when they got to the airport Rick made her get on the plane with her husband even though she wanted to stay with him. He told her she would regret it if she didn't get on the plane so she eventually did but not before an officer got in the way and tried to stop them from boarding the plane. Rick shot him and Ilsa and her husband got on the plane. When the other police arrive, the officer who witnessed the shooting told them to round up the usual suspects in order to protect Rick from getting in trouble for shooting him. The end shows Rick walking away with the man who didn't turn him in and Rick saying the famous line of 'Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.' I didn't hate this movie but it definitely wasn't one of my favorites. The acting was great but I thought it was kind of boring and it didn't really change setting too much, the whole movie pretty much took place in Rick's café.",6,1,2,8 March 2015
Annie Hall," Annie Hall
","I'm not a huge Woody Allen fan and this movie didn't make it any better. It had cool effects throughout the movie but I didn't think the story was that interesting. I thought Annie Hall was kind of boring and I didn't really see the point of it. Annie Hall is about a man named Alvy and a woman named Annie. The two fall in love despite Alvy's weird dorky ways. The two seemed to just clique and they really got along at first. However, when the two moved in together things kind of got awkward and they began getting in each others hair too much. They decided to take a break but one night Annie calls and insists that he gets to her apartment right away. when he arrived she only wanted him to kill a spider for her. They go to California together where Alvy was suppose to present an award and on the flight back they agree that their relationship isn't working. However, Alvy eventually realizes that he does love her and he flies back to California in hopes of winning her back but he fails. In the end, they both move on to someone knew but they both also learned a lot about themselves and love during their time together.",5,0,5,12 May 2015
The Graduate," The Graduate
","I wasn't too crazy about this movie, however it did have some pretty cool camera-work throughout it. I thought the main character, Ben, was very boring and didn't have a lot of personality which made the whole movie kind of boring to me. The movie is about a new college graduate named Ben who didn't really know what he wanted to do with the rest of his life. His mothers friend, Mrs. Robinson, began hitting on him and the two began secretly meeting at hotels and hooking up. However, when Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine, came home from college to visit, Bens dad made him take her out on a date. He ended up liking Elaine and told her about his relationship with her mom which lead for her to not talk to him anymore out of disgust. She went back to college and Ben chased after her trying to convince her to get back with him. Elaine ended up getting engaged to a boy at her college and she is standing at the alter at the end of the movie about to say 'I do' then Ben came running into the church saying how he loved her and that she couldn't marry him. Elaine comes running down the aisle and her and Ben flee the church and get on the bus in hopes of getting back together and starting their own life together. I thought this movie was a lot but it was kind of dull.",5,0,2,12 May 2015
Singin' in the Rain," Singin' in the Rain
","I'm not a big fan of musicals but I did like Singin' in the Rain a lot. I thought everything was great from the editing, lighting, sound, camera-work, acting, just everything about it was perfect! The movie is about a famous 'power couple' Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont who are known for their great chemistry in movies and people think it is in real life also but the real life romance between the two was just for publicity. Well Lina likes Don but Don doesn't like Lina. Don's best friend Cosmo and him have come along way in their success and they don't want Lina to ruin it with her high pitched voice and dumb comments. Don and Lina were known for their silent films but when sound began to make its way into films, Lina's annoying voice would be heard and they wanted to make a musical but Lina could not sing very well at all. Don's new love interest Kathy sings for Lina and they put her voice and singing over Lina's so it sounds good. But when Lina found out it wasn't her voice she was furious. She threatened to sue the company if they took her out of the movie because she signed a contract so they kept her in it just not her voice. After the successful premiere of their musical, Lina went out to sing to the crowd with Kathy singing behind the curtain however, the curtain fell and everyone found out that Lina wasn't the real one singing. Both girls ran away in embarrassment but Don stopped Kathy and told the crowd she was the one with the beautiful voice not Lina. The movie ended with Don and Kathy kissing in front of the poster for their new movie called Singin' in the rain. I loved this movie from start to finish.",8,0,1,12 May 2015
Rosemary's Baby," Rosemary's Baby
","I thought Rosemary's baby was a very interesting and spooky movie. I love scary movies because they are so unpredictable. The movie consisted of lots of dark lighting and pretty average camera work and a variety of short takes. It is about a couple, Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse, who move in to a kind of creepy apartment in Manhattan. They become friends with the old couple next door but weird things began happening to Rosemary that started to freak her out and Guy starts to spend a lot of time with the older couple especially after their ward committed suicide. A woman Rosemary met while doing laundry one day suddenly died a very mysterious death then Rosemary began to hear strange noises and even had a scary dream where a weird scary monster type thing makes love to her. Guy became very distant after Rosemary told him all the weird things she was going through. After she delivered the baby, she found out that her neighbors had other plans for her son. When she awoke after the birth, they told her that her son was dead but then she heard him crying in the next room over and went to see what was going on. After she walked up to her son, who was surrounded by the neighbors, she saw a devilish look in his eye and that's when they told her that her baby was the spawn of Satan. The movie ends with the people trying to convince Rosemary to raise the baby and how she didn't have to join the cult if she didn't want to. The movie ends with Rosemary holding her son and kind of smiling so you don't know what she plans on doing in the future with him which just adds to the overall spooky vibe of the movie.",7,0,2,13 May 2015
