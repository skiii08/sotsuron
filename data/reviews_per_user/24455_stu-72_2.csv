Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," pixar must have been rotfl
","Probably the worst film of the year. 6 year old computer graphics (terrible character animation) a 6 year _olds_ script, terrible acting and dialog that trips off the tongue like a small, securely balanced thing. If you are under 12 you'll love it... it's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in Space. George - it's not the technology that makes a good movie, it's having the talent to use it... yourself and ILM clearly don't. Please don't make another one for another 15 years.",3,0,1,16 July 1999
Enemy at the Gates," Voice sound track is terrible....
",The film is fine (though why it is sitting at 7.4/10 I can't imagine).However I found it very irritating to watch on account of it having possibly the worst voice soundtrack on a movie ever.I was trying to think of a way of explaining this and the best I can do is that it sounds like it has been dubbed into english. Every voice sounds like it was been dubbed on in a studio.. all clean..everyone has the same posh london accent. It all just sounds like thing are sitting it a studio in front of a microphone. very poor.stu,Null,1,2,7 September 2001
