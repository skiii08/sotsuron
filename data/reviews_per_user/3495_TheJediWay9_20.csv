Blade Runner 2049," A Very Good Sequel To A Classic But This Film's Pace Sucks Big Red Donkey Penis
","'Blade Runner 2049,' is the sequel to Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner' from 1982 and 'Blade Runner 2049,' stars Ryan Gosling as Officer K, a Blade Runner himself who is investigating a mystery involving a child and needs the help of Deckard (Harrison Ford) to help him solve the case. This movie is a visual marvel. It is a gorgeous film to look at and Roger Deakins once again does a fabulous job in crafting the cinematography for this film. I feel like the cinematography and the production design really go hand in hand for this one, because if one wasn't good then the other would be just as bad, so luckily it seemed like this was an instance where visions for production design and cinematography worked hand in hand. Everything thing from sound editing to sound mixing and the editing itself in general is seamless. The musical score for this film really resembles that of the original score from the first one., and that was something that I really appreciated.The performances all across the board were really good, but I would just say that Ana de Armas was serviceable in this, but everyone else, from Ryan Gosling to Harrison Ford, gave outstanding performances.The same can't be said for Jared Leto, who continues to get shunned by Warner Bros and only has two scenes in the entire 163 minute runtime thanks to misleading marketing, which bring me to my flaws.The misleading marketing is one. The film's trailers were edited and marketed in a way to make it look like Jared Leto was the main antagonist in the film, and he isn't. He even gets a spot on the poster for his two scenes of work that equal about 8 minutes of screen time. Good job Warner Bros. Keep screwing him over.Also, this film's pacing SUCKS BIG RED DONKEY PENIS. Jeez Oh crow, this film did not have to be as long as it was. Sure the original had scenes that felt slow, but there were only two or three in the original. In this one, there's about a 40 minute chunk where there is literally nothing going on. What doesn't help is that a lot of the scenes are long, drawn-out, and sometimes really quiet. Now I know what I'm getting into when I see a Blade Runner movie. I'm not expecting action scenes at this point, but my god don't let people be bored out of their minds for a good chunk of the movie.With that being said, the story kept me interested in the movie despite its slow as balls pacing, and really got me thinking. People will be mad about e film's pacing and will probably be mad that this isn't an action movie and requires a lot of thought, because people nowadays don't like movies that require a lot of thought. *Cough* ALIEN COVENANT (great movie btw) *Cough*Despite the ever excruciatingly slow as hell pace it's still a very good movie that doesn't act as a setup for another movie for a new franchise, thank god, and I am going to give 'Blade Runner 2049 an A-.Check my review of 'Blade Runner 2049' on YouTube so you don't have read about big red donkey penis anymore:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1IBBYU7Xrw",8,5,15,5 October 2017
Skyfall," 007 Reporting For Duty With Style In What Quite Possibly Could Be His Finest Hour Yet
","Don't listen to the stupid negative reviews of dumb fans about this movie. This is Bond at his best. Sure, Bond may not be trying to stop a villain from taking over the world, but hey, he didn't stop a villain from taking over the world in Licence To Kill, so where's the backlash for that? (Another good Bond movie as well). 'There's a young Q. Worst Bond ever!' STFU it makes more sense that Q is younger.'Bond is Bisexual.' No he's not, Silva was making him uncomfortable. 'The final action scene was like Home Alone.' Sure, they set up booby traps, but it felt a LOT less like Home Alone than I was expecting. The positives from this movie come from Craig's performance as Bond, which, in my honest opinion (and fans may hate me for saying this) but I think Daniel Craig has equaled or either surpassed Sean Connery. The return of the 'Goldfinger' car was classic. The performance of Javier Bardem.... CLASSIC VILLAIN. Played the part so well. They made him feel like a classic villain because he has a deformity, which I shall not reveal.My only complaints were the fact Bond heard M give the order to take the shot, and Bond did NOTHING to get out of the way. And to me, as surprising and fitting the final scene was, with Eve it was a big like WTF moment. Other than that, everything was good.Pure Bond here. He is reporting for duty, with some swag and style, in what is Bond's finest hour yet.",10,4,13,10 November 2012
It," 'You'll Float Too.' 'IT' Earns It Scares And Provides Great Characters And Story
","'IT' is an adaptation of Stephen King's novel and focuses on a group of outsiders who are bullied and after discovering a killer clown that is really a monster, they decide to take him down. I was looking forward to 'IT' despite not having read the book or seen the original miniseries with Tim Curry as Pennywise. The trailers made the movie look intriguing and I thought that this could be the next big break the horror genre needs. I was very pleased.Easily the biggest praise of this movie goes to the writing. This movie has well developed characters and cohesive storytelling. The thing I enjoyed about these characters is that they not only deal with middle school problems and bullying, but they also deal with real life problems that everyone in this world has or will face. These characters, in their early teens, also cuss a lot. It made the characters that much more relatable and realistic and provided a breath of fresh air into the horror genre, and the writers actually understood the age demographic and portrayed it beautifully. The story is also really straightforward. There are no crazy, so-called 'clever' plot twists that a lot of horror movies nowadays try to include. It was cohesive and easy to follow.Not only were the kids well written, but the actors that played them were magnificent. There was not a dull performance form any one of them. Everyone is skeptical when it comes to kid actors, but each actor portrayed his character the way a kid should portray his character. Character wise, there was perhaps a little annoyance with the germaphobe kid but that could be passed off because the characters were so intriguing and relatable. The movies earns it scares too. There aren't any cheap scares either. A couple of 'jumps' in the second half, but good jumps. The second half of the movie is full of all the scars, whereas the first half, while still having some screw, focuses more on setting up the characters and the story for the audience while also providing the necessary haunting imagery to imprint in our heads. The way the films opens up, you no there's no holding back with this movie after watching the opening scene. Bill Skarsgard did a really great job as Pennywise. He was scary, he was menacing, and damn he made me afraid of clowns again. The movie did its job and that is make adults afraid of clowns again. The movie really boils down to being a horror movie mixed with a coming-of-age drama and I appreciated that. I really like when movies have the balls to go all out like that in a horror movie. Horror movies don't have the guts to pull something like that off (runtime is another thing this movie pulls off really well: 2 hrs. 15 mins as opposed to the average 1 hr and 30 mins. for horror films), and to see something so refreshing and relatable is a breath of fresh air. I will say 'IT' will make my top 10 of the year to this point and I am going to give 'IT' an A.Check out my review on YouTube for a more in-depth analysis here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LTU525ZHlw",9,4,11,7 September 2017
Detroit," A Dark, Shocking, And Haunting Vision Of One Of The Most Vile Moments In America's Past.
","'Detroit,' is based on the true story of the 1967 12th Street Riots and Algiers Hotel Incident in Detroit and is brought to us by the writing/directing team of Mark Boal and Katheryn Bigolow, who brought us 'The Hurt Locker' and 'Zero Dark Thirty,' two admittedly overrated movies but two that are still very good in their own right. If there was a team to adapt this true story this is the team to do it. 'Detroit,' isn't the best of the trio, nor is it the best movie of the year, but it is up there in my top ten.The performances were really good in this movie. John Boyega gives another really great performance in the movie, as Star Wars has really launched him into stardom and he continues to shine in everything he has been in. Anthony Mackie was also really good in his short amount of screen time, as he has been good in all his other previous performances as well. The standout here is Will Poulter as the head police officer trying to 'control' the situation in the hotel, and my god, was his performance Oscar worthy. He captured evil, vile, vicious, and violent nature of his character who is a total racist prick. After seeing him in a handful of other movies, i really made nothing of his acting talent but the guy has a strong potential, and easily gave one of my favorite performances of the year (though I DO NOT condone anything his character did). The entire second act of this movie, an hour long sequence inside the Algiers Motel, was one of the most intense, gut-wrenching, shocking, and haunting things I have ever seen. Even though there isn't much in the way of character development for this film, you really feel for the characters regardless. It is a terrible situation that these victims were put into, and it makes you disgusted as a human being to watch another human being do this to another human being. It speaks volumes about the consequences of racism not only in past society, but in today's society as well. The minimal musical score and camera-work really add to the realism of the entire situation and gives the viewer the sense that they are right there, watching the situation unfold right before their eyes, unable to do anything to prevent the said events from happening. It's harrowing, dark and disturbing. The camera work is all hand-held, and the editing is pristine that when the camera starts to get shaky it is edited in a way where you can still understand what is going on, similar to the style of filming in 'The Hurt Locker' and 'Zero Dark Thirty.' For almost the entirety of the runtime, there is no musical score. The first act felt like it could have been a tad shorter, but at the same time it provided background for those viewers, like myself, who were unfamiliar with the situation so that viewers could get a better sense of what was happening in the city of Detroit at the time.My only major complaint with the movie is that it feels a little too dragged out at the end. It has the 'Return Of The King' ending, and could've honestly been 15 or 20 minutes shorter. This is a movie that impacted me deeply, made me disgusted as a human being that racism was and still is a prominent problem in society today. It was a dark and disturbing portrait of a terrible moment in American history. this is a movie that will spark conversations about the entire situation and the consequences of racism long after credits, in a manner similar to how 'American History X' made you think after the credits.I am going to give 'Detroit' an A.For a further in depth analysis of the film check out my review on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAIMbghP7BA",9,12,38,4 August 2017
Knives Out," Idiots Like Jeremy Jahns Will Hate This Because It's Rian Johnson
","Idiots like Jeremy Jahns and the legion of fans he brainwashed into hating Star Wars will hate this movie because it's Rian Johnson and they're still salty over The Last Jedi. People like Chris Stuckmann, Jared Buckendahl, LC Screen Talk, And myself will actually look at this movie through the lens of actual analysis from a filmmmaking perspective, unlike that hack Jeremy Jahns. This is one of my favorite movies of the year and don't let dumb salty Star Wars fans like Jeremy The Dictator Tell you differently.This is a witty script from Rian Johnson, with well thought out characters. It is witty, funny and eccentric. I loved every minute of this movie.Salty Star Wars fans like Jeremy will automatically hate because it's Rian Johnson. They need to grow up",9,15,67,22 November 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," The Best of The Thor Movies, And Definitely One Of The Best of Phase 3
","'Thor: Ragnarok' is the third Thor movie and 17th entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In Ragnarok, Thor, captured on a remote planet and forced to enter a gladiator match against the Hulk, must find a way to get back to Asgard to stop Hela, the goddess of death, from destroying it and bringing about the prophesied 'Ragnarok.'To be honest I haven't seen a Thor movie in the theaters. i missed out on chances to see both of them so I was really excited to see this one, despite thinking 'The Dark World' is average at best. I was really happy. This is some of the most fun I've had all year. Thor actually feels like a character in this film. His dialogue feels more real and natural and I think that's because we've seen him adapting to other realms like Earth in previous films. it felt so genuine and I was happy that he used more of his power rather just swing his hammer around for most of the movie. They made Thor a character, someone you could relate to. The biggest thing this movie has going for it is the fact they took Earth away as the setting. Setting it in the cosmos is exactly what the Thor movies needed, and what should have been done with the second movie. No offense to Natalie Portman, but I'm glad she didn't come back. The story didn't call for it and she wasn't needed.This is a very fun, exciting, and funny film. There are scenes where you are dying of laughter. The action sequences, as always in a Marvel film, are fun to watch. there's a lot of great scenery to go along with those and this is a very colorful movie, which added to the overall visual appeal.The new characters were very well integrated and really likable. My favorite was Valkyrie, played by Tessa Thompson. She did a fabulous job and the character had more of a wild side to her than I was expecting, and that was a nice touch. Jeff Goldblum surprisingly didn't annoy me. There's only so much of him I can handle and he was handled in a way where he was tolerable.Hela was a good villain as well. Not the best, but a lot stronger than most MCU villains, a new trend that Marvel seems to be making sure that they are doing. Cate Blanchett does a very good job and looks like she is having a lot of fun in the role. Hela isn't in the movie a lot, but is in it just enough. She's perfectly functional and more menacing than one might expect.As for issues, they're only very minor. One was the CGI in a couple of scenes was weak, and I didn't really like the character of Skurge. I found him to be kind of bland. I had a blast with this movie. It is my second favorite of phase 3 and one of my favorites in the MCU.I am going to give 'Thor: Ragnarok' an A.

Spider-Man: Homecoming," Definitely The Best Spider-Man Movie Since 'Spider-Man 2'
","'Spider-Man: Homecoming' is the 6th live action adaptation of the popular comic book superhero and third reboot we have gotten, as well as the 16th entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Peter Parker must try to balance his high school life with being Spider-Man while the Vulture (Michael Keaton) is on the loose.I've been a fan of Spider-Man for a long time. I grew up playing Maximum Carnage on Super Nintendo, and watched the original Say Raimi trilogy. I like the first one, love the second one, but when Spider-Man 3 came out it's more of a mixed bag, and the other two after that don't really count in my opinion. I can say this is definitely the best Spider-Man film since Spider-Man 2.What I really liked was that this was essentially a high school teen comedy with Spider-Man. It was interesting to see Peter Parker trying to balance his life as a superhero. He has hardships in his personal life, he has hardships as Spider-Man. He wants to impress Tony Stark so that he can become an Avenger. It was an interesting way to go about things. It wasn't an origin story, thank god. How boring would that have been if Uncle Ben had died again in this reboot? We don't have to see that all over again for the third time. I'm glad they steered clear of that. The Vulture was a solid villain played brilliantly by Michael Keaton. I don't think he was one of the best villains of the MCU like people have said but he was functional and fun to watch. The side characters were really good, but there was one thing with one character at the end that didn't really sit well with me. They made her a character from the comics and I didn't really buy it.Overall I'm going to give 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' an A-Check out my video review on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS-k1snZ7dw",9,4,9,8 July 2017
Baby Driver," A simplistic Plot With Killer Soundtrack Makes 'Baby Driver' A Delight
","'Baby Driver' the new film from Edgar Wright is about a getaway driver named Baby who is forced to work for a criminal mastermind who hires different teams to rob banks. When Baby meets the girl of his dreams, he wants out, but not before being double crossed and forced to work on an other job.Edgar Wright's films are brilliant. I will say that first. They are all funny, original, and relatable. 'Baby Driver' is no different. This may actually be the best Edgar Wright film I have seen (excluding The World's End, which I have NOT seen). This is up there for as one of the best and could be in the running for my favorite movie of the year when all is said and done at the end of the year. First off, the cast is phenomenal and perfectly cast. I have not seen Ansel Elgort in anything else, but he was really good in the movie. Everyone in this movie really gave it their all. Jon Hamm in this movie, HOLY SMOKES. Even Eiza Gonzalez, thought not great, did a very good job and gave it their all.This movie is very original, something there isn't much of these days. It is so well written and you are able to get sucked into this world very easily. The script is very witty, funny, original, and relatable. The characters are not overly developed, but not underdeveloped either. It's just the right amount of characterization.This movie goes in many ways I did not expect. This movie sets up a character to be the main villain and he doesn't end up being the main villain, which I would usually have a problem with but I felt it worked very well for this movie. It wasn't predictable, and usually movies like this are. This one wasn't. it kept me guessing and on the edge of my seat for the entirety of it. Th action is really cool too, and yes there is some shaky cam, but I feel as if it is shaky cam done right. You can still make out what is going on in each scene even when the camera is shaking. the action is just so inventive and cool, as unrealistic as it may be, and it made these scenes really entertaining and fun to watch.This movie also has a killer soundtrack. The soundtrack for this movie is the perfect driving music. It was fun to listen to, and added a little extra to the action scenes. This was by far one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard for a movie. Please do yourselves a favor and see this film next weekend when it comes out. this is what Hollywood needs right now, original films that aren't afraid to push the envelope. This movie was a whole lotta fun. I had a blast with it at my screening, and is definitely up there for best of the year so far.I'm giving 'Baby Driver' the almighty perfect score of an A+Check out my review of 'Baby Driver' on YouTube in the link provided, and please, go and support this movie. I went to a press screening for this so it was free but I will be more than happy to keep paying to see this movie or anything original multiple times in theaters.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rmr2i8MxgA",10,24,48,22 June 2017
Justice League," Ai Yai Yai. This Is The Best They Got?
","'Justice League' is one of the most anticipated for a lot of people. We  have all dreamed of seeing these heroes on the screen for an eternity,  and we finally have it. The DCEU hasn't had a good track record, and  it's no secret that I haven't been too kind to it myself. They're 1 for  4 in my opinion. Now...they're 1 for 5.  I went in giving it a chance. I gave it a chance. I wanted to like it.  It's the Justice League for crying out loud. But it's just not a good  movie.   Everything we hated about BvS is in this movie. They didn't listen.  They try to add some humor into the movie but it doesn't work, and it's  mostly with the Flash. It came across as forced and none of the jokes  were funny. It had some tonal issues, mostly it was a movie trying to  be dark and serious and twisted but then there are attempts at humor  that really throw the movie off its rhythm.   Steppenwolf was a lame villain, with a very generic villain plan. His  plan involves these three boxes that are portals, and he has parademons  and they try to bring about the end of the world and the Justice League  has to stop them. Did i mention beams in the sky yet? His CGI is  atrocious. For a movie with a rumored $300 million dollar budget you  would think the visual effects team would at least try to make it not  look noticeable. it was and it was really distracting. And it wasn't  just Steppenwolf. They do the slo-mo action sequences, which I haven't  been a fan of for a long time, but I understand that is Zack Snyder's  style.   I had heard about the movie being flawed, but fun. I can say I didn't  think it was fun. There were some moments Where I felt I was having fun  but then in the same scenes there was something that just took away  from that fun. Even if the movie wasn't executed properly, which it  wasn't, I wanted to have some fun, and unfortunately I didn't feel as  if I did.  There is some bad editing and cropping too. I noticed some obvious ADR  moments and a lot of the heads were cut off when it came to cropping  scenes.   Characterization is really thin, the plot is thin, there's plot holes  galore thanks to the mandated two hour runtime. This is a band of  superheroes that deserves better than what we got.  I am going to give 'Justice League' a D+.",2,27,54,16 November 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," The Black Pearl Sails Again, As 'Dead Men Tell No Tales' Is A Satisfying-Though Very Flawed- 'Pirates' Sequel
","'Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' is the 5th movie in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise in which a crew of undead pirates led by Captain Salazar escape from the Devil's Triangle, hellbent on killing every pirate at sea. As they seek the Trident of Poseidon, they don't know that Jack Sparrow has been roped in to this adventure as well.I really like the Pirates movies. The first one is no doubt the best. Everyone can say what they want about the sequels, but watching the sequels, even the fourth one, which I think is the best sequel (I know I'm in the minority there) makes me entertained. At this point in the series, I'm not expecting to 'blown out of the water' with these movies. I just expect to kick my feet up and have a good time. For the most part, 'Dead Men Tell No Tales' succeeds in this aspect. However, as of this moment, it is my least favorite of the sequels. It felt like Johnny Depp was just playing Johnny Depp in this movie. It seems like the writers have run out of ideas for good ole Captain Jack. The first action scene of the movie features a bank heist involving Jack Sparrow, and watching it I couldn't help to think if the character would do this. It seemed really out of character. However, with the character of Jack, he was relegated to supporting character again, which was a relief, because I felt the sequels tried too hard to make him the main character. I also liked seeing Jack when he was past his prime. It shows too. Just count how many times in this movie the character is drunk. There was some backstory we got with him involving Salazar, and that was one of the most interesting part of the movie. Javier Bardem was like spitting his lines. It was hard to understand him at times. For the most part, it's solid. But I don't know what he was going for by doing that or if he was told to do that. The character of Salazar though was a menacing villain, and the fact he was hellbent on killing every pirate at sea added more depth to his character. The scene stealer in this though was definitely Barbossa. The character was given some of his best material to date, not quite matching the material from Curse Of The Black Pearl. But it was very effective. He is always the cool anti-hero of this series and this movie continues that trend. he also has some emotional scenes in there as well, which made me care about Barbossa a lot more in this one than in the past sequels.I really enjoyed the concept and the story. Both worked well and people are gonna say that this is too convoluted, which at times, yes it can be, but never to the point of being super complicated like much of the third one was, something this one and the fourth one did a very good job of avoiding. The action scenes were fun. Nothing, I repeat, NOTHING in this series will ever top the three way sword fight on the wheel in Dead Man's Chest, but i thought the action scenes in this one were slightly more memorable than the ones in the fourth one. The only one I didn't like was the bank heist to open up the film. Just felt it was out of place for a Pirates film. No glaring issues with CGI in these scenes either. The action was fun, exciting, and a beauty to look at.This movie though had quite a few missteps. For instance, Orlando Bloom is back. The is not a spoiler since he was in the trailer, but they could have done so much with Will in this movie, but he's relegated to two scenes, where he does nothing. This is the character for me that had the best story arc throughout the series, and you could have given him something even more to close out that story arc. However, the arc does come full circle in sweet, emotional scene at the end that really gave me the feels. There were just other scenes in the movie that I felt were unnecessary. One example is a scene in the middle of the movie where Jack meets a pirate from his past and that pirate wants him to marry someone. Like why? Did we need that? It did nothing to advance the plot, and also felt out of place.The two new leads, the hot chick from Maze Runner and Brendan Thwaites had good chemistry, but there wasn't enough interaction between the two of them to actually get me to care about them. I cared about their ultimate goals, but not so much about them as characters or their budding romance which was trying to harken back to Will and Elizabeth's romance in the first one and I really didn't buy it. Other than their personal goals there was nothing to latch onto these characters with. Their actors were fine. They weren't great, but not terrible. Serviceable. The plot does get a little heavy handed at times, as it falls into the problem the fourth one had. Plot threads come out of nowhere, and everyone randomly has the same goal, which is to acquire the Trident. There were times where it just felt like it was too much.'Dead Men Tell No Tales' for me is the weakest entry in the series, but it isn't atrocious. It's a fun summer movie. Just let this be the end, no matter what that post credits scene teased.I am going to give 'Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' a 6.5/10",7,0,9,25 May 2017
Logan," Brutally violent, emotional, and character-driven, 'Logan' is the Wolverine film fans have been waiting for
","'Logan' is directed by James Mangold and stars Hugh Jackman for one final go around as Wolverine. With an R Rating secured, something the previous two Wolverine films should have had, 'Logan' was bound to be fantastic. It wasn't fantastic. It was phenomenal.If you are going into 'Logan' expecting every scene to just be Wolverine tearing people to shreds you'll be thoroughly disappointed. This is definitely not an action film. There are action sequences in the film, but they are not the main focus of the movie like the previous 2 Wolverine movies tried to make them be. 'Logan' is a grounded film, a film that really takes its time to tell its story and to develop its characters. It's a character-driven film, and it probably has the most characterization in an X-Men film to date. We get enough of Wolverine's backstory within the first few minutes to really become attached to him (if we already weren't). We learn more about Professor X and what he has been doing, and then there's this little girl, who probably should be annoying, but luckily isn't and that was a sigh of relief. This girl, Laura, is the star of the show. It is really 'her' movie. All of the sequences with Laura were riveting. There was that sense of mystery to her character that you wouldn't really expect from a film like this. You don't ever really know what her next move is going to be. Her motivation to find a safe haven is so well felt in this film that it just brings you a sigh of relief that there is still a sense of good out there in the world of this film where everything seems dark, bleak, and hopeless. Hugh Jackman's performance. Yeah the dude gave it his all. This is by far Hugh Jackman's best performance as Wolverine. We've never seen Wolverine this vulnerable. He's old, he's broken down, he's beaten. He can't heal like he used to. The conviction from Hugh Jackman in this movie was just spot on and really captured the ways Wolverine felt at certain moments. It added layers to this film. When Wolverine gets into a fight, Hugh Jackman is so good in these scenes it's like he got into a fight with the filmmakers on set.This film does not hold back from a violence standpoint. From the get go, you know what type of movie you are in for. It is brutally violent, by far the most violent X-Men film w have gotten. Wolverine hacks, claws, and slashes his way through skirmishes with blood, guts, and gore flying. If this is what you had always wanted from a Wolverine movie and haven't gotten it up to this point, well this movie gives you all of that. From a violence standpoint, the violence is there when the film calls for it. It is not violent for the sake of being violent. This is a film that puts its characters and story first before anything else, with violence being a secondary element to help propel the story along and to create tension. It is in the scenes where it should be. If this were just an all-out 2 hour and 20 minute 'hack-and-slash' fest this film would have no depth to it. It would look cool, but giving Hugh Jackman the proper sendoff was what was more important in a film like this.This film at times gets downright emotional. The final scene of the film makes you wanna cry. You care about these characters, you are invested in them. You don't want to see them put in harm's way. Even in the scenes where the film may feel a bit slow, the final act of the film is the payoff. This is where everything really meshes together with a force, creating a pulse-pounding, edge of your seat final sendoff for Hugh Jackman as he retires from the role. This is by far the best Wolverine movie and possibly the best X-Men movie to date. I haven't decided yet. It's up there, and it deserves to be. Everything payed off in this film. It is emotional. It is character driven. It has heart. It is emotional. This is everything anyone could have wanted in a Wolverine film.From me 'Logan' gets a perfect 10/10.",10,535,846,2 March 2017
Beauty and the Beast," Despite Some Pacing Issues And A Few Technical Flaws, 'Beauty And The Beast' Is Still A Magnificent, Magical Journey Boosted By Strong Performances From Its Lead Actors
","'Beauty And The Beast' is Disney's fourth live-action remake of a classic animated film, is directed by Bill Condon, and star Emma Watson as Belle, a bookworm who goes a castle holding a beast who has been coursed and they start to fall in love with each while Gaston (Luke Evans) has other plans. I was really looking forward to this film after seeing 'The Jungle Book,' and seeing how well Disney pulled off that magic, and thankfully it worked in this film. Not as good as the animated classic, but a very strong-live action remake.Emma Watson does a very good job as Belle. I can see this as a career revival for Emma. Looking at her films between Harry Potter and this, I think a lot of people didn't really know where her acting career was going. And goddamn can she sing. Her voice is magnificent. Who knew she could belt those high notes. A movie like this has to have good chemistry from its two leads. if it doesn't, this movie would have failed, but luckily, she and Dan Stevens make a great team and their chemistry together is really realized in a lot of the bonding scenes in this film.Let's talk about Luke Evans as Gaston for a moment. Luke Evans proves why he is one of the best actors working today. Gaston was villainous, he was evil, downright unlikeable, like a classic Disney villain or any movie villain for that matter should be, and it really helped that he was portrayed by someone like Luke Evans. Evans gives it his all and the supporting cast does as well, as not one single one of them has a bad singing voice.Some of the songs were extended, which I liked. The 'Gaston' song was extended for this movie to show just how evil the dude really is, and I appreciated that. All of the classics from the original animated film are in here like 'Belle,' 'Be Our Guest,' 'Beauty And The Beast,' 'Gaston,' and 'Kill the Beast.' My only problem with so many songs and an added 40 minutes on the runtime compared to the original is that at times it feels like this film can be a bit slow. You feel like you're a lot further into this film than you really are and you realize that sometimes a couple of the songs drag. There also some times that the CGI with the Beast bothered me. It didn't look very smooth in these scenes when it was mostly flawless for the rest of the film. I've talked to other people about this and they say they didn't notice it, but for some reason I did, and it stuck out so I had to talk about a technical flaw I saw.This vision is well realized. The world this film portrays portrays it in a way that is believable. You believe this place actually exists and is fantasy world that people like Belle could live in. I really liked this movie, and am looking forward to many more Disney live-action remakes.I am going to give 'Beauty And The Beast' an 8.5/10.You can find my video review of 'Beauty And The Beast' on YouTube here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMtb_uXG9c4",9,3,13,19 March 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Bigger-But Not Better-Than The Original, 'Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2' Offers Plenty Of Character, Action, Emotion, And Remains Damn Fun
","'Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2' is the sequel to the highly successful 'Guardians Of The Galaxy' movie released in 2014 that introduced us to a band of misfits brought together to save the galaxy. In this installment Star-Lord is determined to learn more about his heritage: who he is, where he came from, who his father is, and meets his father (played by Kurt Russell) while he and the other Guardians have to eliminate a threat and save the galaxy once again. Vol. 2 isn't necessarily better than the first one. It suffers from what I like to call 'sequelitis.' It is bigger however, but not from an action standpoint, but rather a character standpoint and I appreciated that. When this film has the choice of giving us a gigantic action over a heartfelt character moment it will chose the character moment. It is a character driven film, with the action scenes, while there are quite a few, far between each other. The first 20-30 of the film really doesn't have a focus and feels a bit choppy. It feels like a sitcom released to theaters and not all of the jokes land. There are a lot of jokes and moments of humor and at times during this opening of the movie it became too much, almost as if the movie relied on them to keep you invested. Some of the characters are a waste. Drax doesn't do much in the movie. He kind of just hangs out. That was disappointing to see, as Drax was one of my favorite parts of the first movie. Another miss was Stallone's character. Stallone should have been kicking ass in this movie. Instead he is sidelined only appearing in the movie for a measly 5 minutes of screen time accumulating two scenes. It was a huge miss, and really could have had Stallone play a big part in this movie, though it does set him up for a much larger role in the third installment. The action scenes were really cool to look at. The visual effects and CGI were top notch. Everything in these scenes were edited and filmed in a very good way. The CGI on Baby Groot was seamless. I like how the movie focused on Star-Lord's heritage and the numerous relationships these characters have with each other and certain things. This is why I pay to see movies like this because we have the characters that we have grown to love. The villains are lame. They're just gold people that the movie sets up and doesn't really do anything with. Malekith from 'Thor: The Dark World' looks amazing compared to them. These gold people are probably my least favorite villains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to date and proof Marvel hasn't fixed their villain problem.Still a damn good time though. When the action, humor, and emotions mix together and mesh very well the movie flows with much more force behind it.I am going to give 'Guardians Of The Galaxy: Vol. 2' an 8.0/10.",8,1,3,4 May 2017
The Shape of Water," One Of My Favorite Movies Of The Year
","'The Shape Of Water' is the new project from writer/director Guillermo Del Toro who brought us Pan's Labyrinth, Pacific Rim, The Hellboy Movies and to an extent The Hobbit trilogy (which gets to much hate). I wasn't a huge fan of Crimson peak, but the Shape Of Water really looked intriguing from the trailers. I sat there blown away by what I was seeing. This is one of my favorite films of 2017. It is unique, original, interesting, intriguing, and weird all at the same time.Sally Hawkins gives a really great performance in one of the most inspirational performances I have ever seen. her character is mute and has no lines of dialogue aside from a dream sequence, but man does she play this character with confidence. The supporting cast also does a really great job, Michael Shannon of course being the next standout, and no one phone sin a performance at all. This film has that old school vibe to it. There is a use of a lot of practical effects, and the makeup and hairstyling is some of the best I've seen on film this year. The amphibian creature, if it is motion captured, is seamlessly integrated into the movie that the use of practical effects looks so appealing.The set designs are also really great. Lots of little details that you have to pay attention to that you wouldn't normally pay attention to. The lighting in these scenes also adds a lot of depth to the movie. There are scenes that are dim for a reason, and some with more lighting for a reason. It is really a great way to use lighting to convey the details of the environment. This is a story that grabbed me from the beginning. Not once was I bored watching this movie. It kept me engaged and there is so much character development that it ended up making me care at the end. Out of all of the characters that you root for, there is not one single character that you end up not liking.And if my memory serves me correctly, there is not one scene of exposition in this film. Not one. There are some 'hints' here and there as to what is going on in the background, but from what I remember it's not explicitly stated. It leaves it up to you to put together all of the clues and I really like that about this film.I'm happy we got something original in Hollywood. Everyone craves for something original, and then everyone hates it when something original comes out. It was a nice breath to just see something so refreshing instead of plot threads being retreaded and following clichÃ©s that we see in movies nowadays. This is one of my favorite films of the year.I am going to give 'The Shape Of Water' an A+.",10,53,99,8 December 2017
The Disaster Artist," A Hilarious Dramedy About The Art Of How Not To Make A Movie
","'The Disaster Artist' is a true story based on the making of the notoriously bad cult film 'The Room,' directed by Tommy Wiseasu. Wiseau is played by James Franco and Wiseau's friend Greg Sestero is played by Dave Franco. This was interesting, because I had heard so much about 'the Room' and its cult status as one of the worst movies ever made. The trailer for the Disaster Artist was really intriguing, and I walked out pretty pleased.This movie has the Franco Brothers and Seth Rogen, and we all know the reputation that comes with them. They make stoner comedies and basically all play the same characters in every movie they're in. That is not the case here. All of those clichÃ©s from those movies that we see from these guys are thrown out of the window. It was a nice change of pace and pleasant surprise for all of these guys after watching their work and seeing the same stale comedies delivered to audiences.I also wouldn't 'technically' categorize this movie as a 'comedy.' It's definitely more of a dramedy with comedic scenes mixed in, but this is because Tommy Wiseau, who is so magnificently played by James Franco in what is probably his best performance to date (yes I went there), is such a weird, mysterious, eccentric, and strange individual that his words and actions and his weird passion to make a movie come off as comedic. It's the more intense drama scenes that really work well within this movie. I will add that the comedic scenes shown the trailer are not the only funny scenes in the movie. There's definitely more humor in the movie aside from those scenes.My issue with this movie really just comes down to pacing. It took a while for the buildup, and I get it, it's character development and you have to explain the relationship between Tommy and Greg, and that's character development, but it just felt a little too long. There were instances where I was checking my watch and thought to myself 'i thought Seth Rogen was in this movie.' I would also say that the character of Amber, played by Alison Brie, really didn't move the story forward all that much and I felt like she wasn't needed.Overall, I enjoyed it. Laughed my ass off in some parts. Both Francos and Seth Rogen for that matter are really good in the movie, it's a behind the scenes type of movie that shows you how not to make a movie. I thought they did a really good job of capturing just how strange and determined Tommy Wiseasu was.I am going to give 'The Disaster Artist' a B+.Check out my review of 'The Disaster Artist' here on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT5-PfMK180",8,72,107,15 November 2017
American Made," Good Performances And Directing But An Excruciatingly Slow Pace And Got Me Bored After Awhile
","'American Made' is the true story of Barry Seal, played by Tom Cruise, who was a former pilot turned drug smuggler and become an informant for the DEA in the 1980s. I was really looking forward to this movie since it had Tom Cruise in it, but I was ultimately let down by an excruciatingly slow pace and a movie that felt really rushed. I don't agree with the critics on this one. I will say this, the movie is very well directed and most of the movie is shot with a hand-held camera, which to me is different for a drama. Director Doug Liman has proved before that he can use hand-held camera the proper way and this is no exception.Tom Cruise also delivers an award worthy performance. This is him unhinged, and probably the best I've ever seen him. You could even say he's on Cruise control.The rest of the movie just fell really flat for me. This film has really poor pacing, as it felt both rushed and a lot longer than it felt. There are a lot of time jumps and it really doesn't give the film a chance to breathe. There is really no intro tot he film as well, which I know there are other movies out there that just jump right into the thick of things, but I felt I needed some more background information as to what the situation was and who the character was. There was no emotional tug at the heartstrings in this film for me.This movie's lack of a musical score also made the film feel a lot longer than it was. Sure there is a soundtrack in the background in some scenes, and I'm not expecting some epic, blockbuster musical score to go with a movie like this, but the films I find slow are the ones with a lack of musical score at most times. I am going to give 'American Made' a C.Check out my review of 'American Made' on YouTube for a more in depth analysis:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iw4ddqed5VE",5,4,10,28 September 2017
Arrival," 'Arrival' is a well-directed, thought-provoking film about understanding extra terrestrial life.
","'Arrival' is directed by Denis Villeneuve and stars Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, and Forest Whitaker, and when alien spacecrafts touch down on Earth, Louise, played by Amy Adams, is asked by the US government to interpret and understand why and what they are doing here.Don't go into 'Arrival' expecting crazy action scenes and explosions. Though this is an alien invasion movie, it is a film that is grounded and winds up being a character study. We learn a lot about Amy Adams as a character (No bathtub scenes in this one). we learn about her troubled past, and we see how she acts when she feels the government starts to take too much control. She did a fantastic job in these scenes, and the entire cast did a very good job as well. Tension in this film is very well presented. Though there are no action scenes, you feel as if the aliens could attack at any second, or the humans could attack at any second. It is very well realized. Almost any time a human enters the alien spacecraft it is presented in a way in which you feel like something bad is going to happen, and I really give the film props for that.This movie is so well shot and well directed. Denis Villeneuve keeps proving himself as a director. Each shot in this film has a purpose. They way certain scenes are shot really help to ratchet up this tension that is presented in these scenes as well. The creature designs did kind of bother me but it's only a small nitpick. The aliens look like giant squids. That's basically all I can say about them.Now let's talk about the third act of the film. The third act of the film really makes you question the entire thing. There's a big revelation at the end, a plot twist in other words, and it really makes you wonder. There are some things that are glossed over in this third act, as it seemed a bit more focused on trying to be clever and smart, which it was. But this twist just seemed to come out of left field. It definitely didn't hinder the movie. It's a twist that makes you think long and hard. I have had multiple discussions with co-workers who have seen the film and some of them can't even figure out what the film was about. It's a film you really have to study, and this third act may detract some viewers. If there are people who don't really like sci-fi and are watching this film and then the twist happens, they may not understand it. I think it's a twist left open for many interpretations, and the film does a good job of selling that, but really doesn't answer some of the other questions it presents in its first two-thirds that you may have had. There were definitely some things that could have been explored more.I am going to give 'Arrival' a 9.2/10",9,1,5,23 March 2017
Da 5 Bloods," In A Year That Sees Pandemics, Horrible Movies, And Studios Trying To Kill Movie Theaters, This Is Refreshing!
","Spike Lee's newest film DA 5 BLOODS is out on Netflix now is about a group of African-American war veterans who served together in Vietnam and return to the city to find the remains of their fallen comrade and the gold he promised them.What a wonderful, thought-provoking, and timely movie. One of the best movies of the year! Delroy Lindo is gunning for that Oscar, deserves and Oscar nomination, and should win.This is by far Spike Lee's most ambitious and violent film to date. The story may not seem like it plays out to something that will have relevancy to the current climate, but it's Spike Lee and he manages to weave in messages about society's pitfalls and the current political climate in ways you would never understand.One of the very best of the year to this point, and it feels so good to say that a movie is 'one of the best of year' in a year that has studios are trying to kill movie theaters, a global pandemic, and more movies that are horrendous rather than great.DA 5 BLOODS belongs in popcorn heaven!",9,1,3,15 June 2020
Hacksaw Ridge," 'Hacksaw Ridge' Is A Return To Form From Mel Gibson, Showcasing The Bloodshed Of War
","'Hacksaw Ridge' is directed by Mel Gibson and stars Andrew Garfield as Desmond Doss, an American Army solider in World War II who, for various reasons, believed that though the war was justified he could not kill anyone and saved 75 men behind enemy lines.Mel Gibson returns to the director's chair for this film, and say what you want about him but he makes some damn good films. I was really excited for Hacksaw Ridge. Not only had I heard good things about it, but it won a couple of Oscars and Mel Gibson was directing. Unfortunately, I didn't get to see this one in the theaters but I wish I did.'Hacksaw Ridge' is a return to form for Mel Gibson, showcasing the life of Desmond Doss and providing a glimpse of the horrors and bloodshed of war.What really worked in this movie was the acting. I wasn't a huge fan of Garfield as Spider-Man but this guy proved me wrong. He did a very good job as Desmond Doss, portraying him in a way where I think only he could pull this off. Vince Vaughn surprisingly doesn't play his usual Vince Vaughn self. He is very effective as an army sergeant and has some good timing with his comedic lines.When the battle happens, it's brutal and that's ways been something that Gibson has done very well with. We know that WWII was not pleasant, and this battle certainly wasn't pleasant. The thing I like about it is that it doesn't give you time to digest it all. It throws you into the battle, right in the heat of things, and you aren't able to catch your breath. From here on out the film is intense. The battle of Hacksaw Ridge has to be one of the most intense battles in cinematic history. One flaw I was the pacing. It took half the movie to get to what we really wanted to see. I understand you are setting up backstory and characters, but there had to be more to the battle. The battle just kind of ends on a low note. It felt strange. It was almost like there was a complete section of the film of that was cut out.Overall, very solid and I am going to give 'Hacksaw Ridge' an 8.9/10",9,2,4,8 March 2017
Alien: Covenant," 'Alien: Covenant' Is A Vast Improvement Over 'Prometheus' That Focuses On Expanding The Series' Mythology
","'Alien: Covenant' is directed by Ridley Scott and is the second 'Alien' prequel and the sequel to 2012's 'Prometheus.' In 'Alien' Covenant,' the crew of the ship Covenant, make way to find a planet that they can colonize, only to be terrorized by creatures hunting them down and an unknown inhabitant that lives on the planet.I went to a press screening go this in Boston, and going into this screening I prayed and hoped for it to be better than 'Prometheus.' I only saw Prometheus once when it was first released, and just watched it again for the second time earlier today to prepare for 'Alien: Covenant.' Prometheus was a bland, very uneventful movie. It answered none of the questions that Ridley Scott wanted it to answer, so I was skeptical about this sequel. Luckily....it turned out to be good. 'Alien: Covenant' is a vast improvement over Prometheus that really expands the series' mythology and is a very entertaining and enjoyable ride.One thing I noticed was that shaky camera was used for the action scenes, but used very well in a way where you could still tell what was going on. Not a lot of directors, barely any for that matter, can perfect that, but I think Ridely Scott was on point when it came to how those scenes were shot and directed. It gave the film this kind of realness that I did not expect it to have. Luckily, there is more action in this movie than there was in its predecessor. The action scenes are really fun. They're bloody, they're gory, they're everything we want an Alien movie to be. No, nothing was all that ground breaking when it came to writing and crafting these scenes, but these scenes present a sense of claustrophobia since most of them are filmed in small locations and in the dark. The final action scene in the movie feels very similar to the way the first one ended but doesn't feel like a complete ripoff of that film. This is visually the best movie of the year so far. The cinematography is lush. The vast landscape from this planet is so well captured and so well realized that you get a sense that planets like the probably do exist in this universe. Many, not all, but many questions about where the Xenomorph comes from are answered in this movie. There are still some blurry spots, still some things I'm not too sure about or a little hazy on, but for the most part most of the questions we have regarding the Aliens and where they come from are starting to get answered and our remaining questions will be (or should be) answered by the time the third prequel comes around.This movie felt like it breathed new life into a series that was waning. Ridley Scott seemed to take all of the complaints fans had about Prometheus to heart and set out to create something that would both please those fans and create new fans. It's almost like he knew Prometheus wasn't a good movie and accepted the fact that fans were right, and made a movie for the fans. It is a good blend between the claustrophobic, psychological horror of 'Alien,' and the sci-fi action adventure of 'Aliens,' with the worst parts of 'Prometheus' chucked out the window.This movie does have its faults, and most of those faults lie within the characters and the decisions they make. Nobody in this movie is really all that fleshed out, save for Michael Fassbender's characters. There's nothing really there emotionally to help you latch on to these characters. None of the really have backstories. Katherine Waterston's character has somewhat of a backstory, but even then it's not much. I did not find the need to care for these characters or even care at all if I had to because most of these characters aren't fleshed out and are just expendable. The characters aren't very smart either. When you see a giant egg covered in goo, probably a good idea not to touch it...right? Or shoot an alien that's calm just to make it mad...right?Another problem is predictability. This is easily the most predictable movie I have seen this year. Just judging from the trailer you knew which of the crew were gonna die. There were certain plot points that I guessed about halfway through, and something at the end that I saw coming from a mile away. It just did not sit well with me. When I can predict things like that, it brings the movie down for me.Overall, a solid return to form for the 'Alien' franchise. Nowhere near as good as 'Alien' or 'Aliens,' but LOADS better than Prometheus. The other two don't count.I'm going to give 'Alien: Covenant' a 7.7/10Check out my video review on YouTube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06cSmrtQRH4&t=1s",8,43,86,10 May 2017
