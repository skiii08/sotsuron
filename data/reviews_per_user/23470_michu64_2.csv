Requiem for a Dream," I left the theatre feeling like I was beaten up!
","I have never had such an emotional and harrowing experience like sitting through this movie.  The sad story of 4 drug addicts and the consequences of their addictions.  All the performances are first rate, but it is Ellen Burstyn who delivers the powerhouse here.  Your heart truly does break for her.  After I left the theatre, I was sobbing all the way to the bus stop. All these young female Hollywood wannabees should see this and observe what it means to REALLY be an actor.  I cannot tell enough people who will listen that 'JULIA ROBERTS DID NOT DESERVE THE OSCAR!!!!' I dare anyone who isn't hopelessly in love with Julia to see this movie and they will know that I'm right.",Null,0,1,14 February 2002
Once Upon a Time in America," One of the BEST gangster films ever made!
","I would really like to know when and if this movie will be released on dvd. It was a real travesty that such a beautiful,sprawling epic like this could be dismissed into the trash bin by an uninformed movie public.  This film should be mentioned in the same breath as The Godfather,and Goodfellas.  An un-cut 3hour and 40 minutes dvd release loaded with extras and a strong advertising push may raise awareness with todays audiences and give it the presentation it so richly deserves.If anyone hears news of a dvd release, please let me know.",Null,0,2,12 February 2002
