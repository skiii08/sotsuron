Hereditary," This movie was ALMOST perfect.
","We went and saw this movie opening weekend for Father's Day I think. We were excited to see a good thriller/suspense horror film. Hacker/slasher films are a dime a dozen these days and are not scary. I wanted to be SCARED. And I WAS. This whole movie was fantastic. It was creepy, uncomfortable, suspenseful, and shocking (when the mom is on the ceiling banging her head!!!! Eeek!) .....until the end. The ending was lame and it felt like they didn't know how to end it. I'm all for 'can't always have a happy ending', that's fine. And I got it, it didn't fly over my head. Some people said they had to watch it more than once to get it, I did not. Weird movies are my bread and butter. Grama is a 'head' satanist, summons a demon, demon gets into little girl, can't survive there because she's a girl and sick, has to move to other people, moves to the mom temporarily when the girl dies, ultimately moves to the son, makes him kill himself so he can have the body to himself. Okay? That's it tho? What a shame. It really had the makings for a tremendous horror film. I gave it a 7 because up until the last 15 mins it really lived up to the hype and is worth what you feel before the ending.",7,0,0,18 April 2020
