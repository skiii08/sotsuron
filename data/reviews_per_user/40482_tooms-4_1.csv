Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," How can you pay out this film...
","I saw this film on a business trip to America... I am the biggest Star Wars fan I know, and quite frankly I think people are just expecting too much. George Lucas said himself that the whole Star Wars thing was a saturday night flic! Yes the original trilogy had brilliant characters and brilliant SPFX (for its time) but the characters came from somewhere! Now we are seeing where these characters came from! Where they were born from!If you look at 'A New Hope' it is very thin plot wise and its characters hold it together! The Blatantly obvious good vs. evil as someone else put it on this comments system was brilliant and got us into the story. Remember that it was drawn from the classic American cowboy stories! Now 'The Phantom Menace' brings back this good vs evil, giving our mundane society a chance to boo and hiss the baddies and cheer the goodies. Name a Saturday Night style flic were it is not well defined.As for the critics... The most inconsistent bunch of losers I have ever heard of! A critic here in Australia gave 'Independance Day' 5 stars (high down here) and literally said the new Star Wars was a sin! Go figure that one... I think they are a bit cut from Goeorge Lucas' rules and total ownership of the whole deal! I think they want to see it fail and so do a large number of Star Wars haters. I say to you 'GIVE IN', it is not deep, it does not have underlying themes and issues, it does not discuss contraversal things. It helps us escape our day to day lives and live a fantasy that is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!! ENJOY IT, this world is too serious!",10,0,0,27 May 1999
