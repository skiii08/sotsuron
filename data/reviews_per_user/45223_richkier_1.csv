The Ring," I do not scare easily, but this was unnerving...
","Ok, I had never heard of the original Ringu before this, but I was interested when someone at work brought me 'the tape' and I watched it. At first I thought it was going to be another Scream clone, but I soon found myself completely, and thoroughly freaked out. The opening sequence was somewhat predictable (scary, but predictable), but for me, that was where the film took a very dark turn. I have been a horror movie fan for years, and have NEVER covered my eyes, or looked away from a horror film EVER. This film scared me. There were several parts where I was unable to look directly at the screen. I actually COVERED my eyes. The spliced in frames of 'the ring' flashing on the screen stayed with me for the entire next day. It didn't have that great of a script, but I thought the actors did well with what they had. I was alittle disappointed with the ending, but overall I was so affected by this that I almost had nightmares. My wife thought it was so funny that I was scared that she set up a little joke to play on me right before I was about to fall asleep. She chose a blank channel on the tv in our bedroom (yes, snow and white noise) and hid the remote under her pillow, turning on the tv as I was just drifting off. Funny, right? Anyway, even with the so-so script, and the hollywood anding, it was still the scariest film I have ever seen. Ever.",Null,0,0,26 October 2002
