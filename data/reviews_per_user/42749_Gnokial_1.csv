Mission: Impossible III," Best in the series
",Mi1 was so so. Mi2 abysmal. Mi3 is getting there as it is much more fast-paced and action-packed which movies of this genre should. The plot is also better.Don't follow the other people in trying to figure out what Rabbit foot is. You should be able to recognise the biohazard symbol on the container. Don't get bog down. Just enjoy the movie as it flows.My only wish would be to cut out those love interests of the main character which was not done in the original classic and hence made the MI team so much more professional.There was also a lot more teamwork in the original team whereas too much limelight concentrates on Ethan Hunt.,7,0,0,9 May 2007
