The Monuments Men," One of the worst movies I've ever seen.
","The movie was shown in the cinema last Friday, I was so eager to watch it when first saw the participation of famous actors and heard about its historic content. However, I was soon disappointed. I even left cinema before the movie ended (I have never done like that before). The movie was like a mixture of dramatic genre. Terrible script, awful dialogue. Damage actors'fame(I mean George Clooney and Matt Damon). Besides, historical story is always a challenge for director therefore George Clooney should not take risk with it when he has limited experience with directing. Although I admire him lot but this movie should be considered as his failure.",4,0,2,10 March 2014
