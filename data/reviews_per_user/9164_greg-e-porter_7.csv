Black Swan," Black Swan is a great psychological thriller/adaptation of Swan Lake; it's a solid movie.
","We follow Nina Sayers (Portman) who is going into her third or fourth year as a New York ballerina. Swan Lake is the ballet of the season and Nina is looking forward to getting a main part; the director promised her something more than a minor part because she's so talented and dedicated. 'Looking forward to,' is something of an understatement though; she is desperate, if for no other reason than to appease her domineering mother. The stress of trying to get the role is overwhelming. It mixes with her fears and anxieties about the competition from the new spunky, sexy dancer, Lily (Kunis). Weird and creepy things start to happen as Nina starts to breakdown.I'm not going to say really anything else about the story other than that the movie incorporates Swan Lake is a really great way. Sometimes movies that are called 'adaptations' are really more attempts to directly translate a story to the silver screen. Black Swan, however, takes source material and changes it to a new situation. Now that's what I call an adaptation.The cinematography is great and the music is spectacular. This is a solid movie. It isn't too scary either. I heard it was creepy but because it's a psychological thriller, that helps; you know that a lot of the stuff is in her head. It's not like a monster is going to get her and then you.I'm not surprised Natalie Portman won the Academy Award for her performance; she did a darn good job. Mila Kunis gave a great performance too. It gave me a newfound respect for her, actually. I've always associated her with expensive but lame movies like Friends with Benefits (2011) or Jupiter Ascending (2015) but I've been slowly warming up to her.Although, now that I look at the dates of those movies, it would seem that she is going kinda downhill because Black Swan came out in 2010 but this is to say that she is capable of a solid role. I mean, look at Nicholas Cage. His name on a movie poster is like the red X on the door of a plague victim. But! But, I say, he did win an Academy Award for Leaving Las Vegas so he has (or at least had) the ability to do it.",9,1,3,1 June 2016
Zootopia," Zootopia was cute, fun, and nice; I wasn't expecting much and was pleasantly surprised.
","As the introduction explains, in ages past, the animal kingdom was divided into two groups, predators and prey, who constantly lived at odds. Fortunately, overtime they evolved to form a society where animals can live in harmony. A utopia...or a Zootopia. Pun aside, Zootopia is the name of the giant city in which all the animals live. In this city, so explains our protagonist bunny (Goodwin), anyone can be anything their heart desires. In the case of our heroine bunny, she dreams to become the first bunny cop (larger animals like Bulls and Elephants tend to be cops). Will she be able to follow her dream despite the adversity that will surely follow?My expectations were low for Zootopia. It looked colorful but I didn't think it had much else going for it. I was, however, mistaken. Zootopia is a really pleasant movie overall. The animation isn't merely colorful, it's fun and dynamic. The city itself is divided into different climate-based zones: you have the jungle, tundra, desert, and regular old concrete jungle section of the city. Even though you only see brief portions of Zootopia, it feels like a fleshed out world. It's fun.I'd recommend Zootopia for anybody. It was a pleasant family friendly movie. It is somewhat predictable here and there but, what do you want, it's a kids movie.",8,1,2,1 August 2016
Suicide Squad," Suicide Squad was mediocre at best but more-so disappointing because of its potential but, at the same time, it doesn't quite deserve all the hate it is getting.
","In the superhero world which has Batman and Superman, what if we were able to convince supervillains - like Joker's girlfriend, Harley Quinn (Robbie) and the world's top assassin Deadshot (Smith) - to fight for good? That's the premise of Suicide Squad. It sounds like fun. Who doesn't love a good group of anti-heroes? And can you get any better than comic book anti-heroes? Unfortunately, terrible writing and poor decisions spell doom for this potentially fun superhero flick.The movie opens to the music of The Animals' 'House of the Rising Sun'. We see an intimidating high security prison so, I suppose, we're to assume that there are some pretty mean characters being housed here. We meet our first inmate, Deadshot (Smith), and watch his interaction with a sadistic guard. Aside from the fact that Deadshot is in a prison, we aren't really given any reason why he's a villain. Never mind the fact that this is Will Smith we're talking about. When is he really ever a bad guy? A Bad Boy, maybe, but not a bad guy.We then cut over to meet Harley Quinn (Robbie). Grace's rendition of 'You Don't Own Me' plays as we see Quinn lounging about her cell that sits in the middle of a heavily guarded room. The same sadistic guard approaches her and flirts with the supervillain. The bars on her cell are electrified, throwing her to her back into a daze. We cut to a flashback of the guards (led by the sadistic one) force feeding the crying Quinn and even taking a selfie with her while she is bound. Again, we might have some association with Harley Quinn (being the significant other to the Clown Prince of Crime) but we don't know that she's a villain. We continue to meet other people but you get the ideaÂ…The Suicide Squad, as we learn, is the brainchild of a stone cold military woman. She opens a binder labeled 'Top Secret' and proceeds to introduce each member. Each of the what, 5 or 6 people, have a several minute expository clip. It begins with a still shot of a given character which has their name and some interesting facts about them. It's a tired method of introducing characters and, man, does it take up a lot of time. We're like 20 minutes into the movie it feels like and we haven't even assembled the team! It's almost like we sat through a promotional short film for the actual movie. I'd kinda prefer if that were the case because we might be able to have a better movie in a year or two.The most painful part about Suicide Squad, and I mentioned this in the bottom-line, is that there was so much potential. Leaving the theatre, I kinda wanted to go and see it again because, maybe, it would be different. That's a sign of a healthy relationship, am I right? Save yourself the time and money and pass on Suicide Squad at least in terms of a theater visit. I'd recommend watching one of the Avengers movies if you want a comic book action movie, or maybe Dark Knight if you want a darker comic book movie with a lot of action. Now I've got a few bones to pick so mind yourself of spoilers.There are so many things about Suicide Squad (both big and small) that don't work. One thing, as I mentioned, is the team introductory montage. It's unnecessarily drawn out and it bogs down the rest of the movie. Now, at one point, the story's main villain attacks (I'll keep it vague to protect against spoilers). The main military guy who leads the squad knows what happened. Eventually, Will Smith confronts him and says, 'You know what happened. Tell us.' So the military guy proceeds to tell them (and us) what happened. Meanwhile, we watch it happen again. We saw it the first time...you know, like, when it happened. Why are you wasting precious minutes actually recycling footage? I mean, sure, there's that film making adage 'show don't tell' but, guys, I don't think this is what it means.Even down to the main plot of the movie - so and so is trying to destroy the world - feels tired. You're doing something wrong if 'the world is going to end' feels dull. Just because they live in a world with Batman and Superman, doesn't mean that there are different fish to fry (not bigger but different). The lame plot is, perhaps, just an indication or symptom of Suicide Squad's biggest offender: the writing.The actors do a fine job with what they're given but they aren't given much. The character development is nigh non-existent. We only get a few moments where we see the potential of Harley's character. We see glimpses of her relationship with the Joker (Leto) and her feelings but they don't go anywhere.In the case of Deadshot, just having bits of dialog to show that he loves his daughter isn't character development. He's the highest paid assassin in the world (and along with that, I'd be surprised if he only killed 'bad guys' but the movie doesn't get into that) and he was captured because his daughter didn't want him to kill his captor. Did his capture get him to reflect on his life choices? Hardly (or if it did, I wasn't feelin' it).",4,2,4,1 September 2016
Ratatouille," Ratatouille is a wonderful Pixar movie that I would recommend to anyone especially if one enjoys food.
","Ratatouille opens with an exposition describing the late, fictional celebrity chef Gusteau (Garrett) whose motto was 'Anyone can cook.' We cut to our protagonist; a rat named Remy (Oswalt). Remy is gifted with an advanced sense of smell which teaches him to appreciate the food that he eats. He'd rather not eat garbage when there is a whole culinary world around him. In his attempts to get some basic spices, he stumbles upon a cooking show featuring the aforementioned chef. Before he knows it, Remy finds himself in Paris. Exploring a little further, he makes his way to Gusteau's restaurant. He watches, with hungry eyes, the creations of the master chefs. Remy crosses paths with the recently hired garbage boy, Linguini (Romano). The pair team up; Linguini will be the human representative of the two, while Remy provides the culinary direction.Ratatouille isn't too dissimilar from the dish of the same name. Ratatouille (the dish) is a bunch of vegetables, cooked together and baked. It's simple but it can be delicious. In Ratatouille we follow the smallest of characters, a rat, in his quest to do what he dreams; to cook. There are so many wonderful decisions even with the basic premise. Consider the idea of simply cooking. It's something we can all relate to because even if the audience doesn't like to cook per se, who doesn't like food? We can follow Remy's quest and imagine tasting his creations. And even the desire to cook is attainable for anyone in the audience. It just takes practice to get a sense of the mechanics, aromas, and flavors. Indeed, 'anyone can cook' and Ratatouille makes the ordinary that much more magical.The music of Ratatouille is phenomenal (I'm listening to the theme song 'Le Festin' by Camille as I write). Some of the characters, particularly Linguini, teeter on goofy which I'm not the biggest fan of but they are so darn endearing it's OK. The graphics are, of course, incredible. Early in the film, Remy goes down a raging river and the water effects are amazing, even by today's standards and this came out in 2008.I'd highly recommend Ratatouille. I've seen it several times and it's always been a lot of fun. It's accessible to everyone too so it's a great family movie. I hope you see Ratatouille and enjoy it as much as I have. This is, of course, assuming you haven't seen it a number of times already.",9,0,1,29 July 2016
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," I wouldn't say that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory holds up as a standalone movie, let alone a remake.
","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is Tim Burton's 2005 adaptation of the book with the same name. Just watching the opening credits, in all it's dated (even for 2005) graphical glory, you can see the names appear on the screen: Helena Bonham Carter, Johnny Depp, music by Danny Elfman. We got the whole Burton crew here, boys, let's rumble.Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, if you've seen the '70's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, is largely what you'd expect; the reclusive candy-man Willy Wonka has announced that he will open his mysterious factory to the lucky children who find the several Golden Tickets hidden within chocolate Wonka bars.Let me just start off this brief review to say that I wouldn't recommend this movie. I didn't enjoy the songs, the characters, or the stylistic decisions. I couldn't help but compare it to the original which I've seen countless times. The first portion of the movie is mediocre enough. It looks kinda like a Wes Anderson movie (he directed The Grand Budapest Hotel and Moonrise Kingdom) but more black and white checkerboard. But as soon as Johnny Depp comes into mix, everything takes a sharp downward turn.You know how sometimes, especially with action movies, the hero eclipses the rest of the movie? It doesn't really matter about what is going on because we get to see the hero kick butt. For example, at first, there was Terminator and then shortly thereafter, there were Schwarzenegger movies. It doesn't matter who Schwarzenegger is fighting as long as I'm along for the ride. This works with Tim Burton now that I think about it; there was Nightmare Before Christmas and now we have Tim Burton movies. It doesn't really matter what's going on as long as I get to see some whimsy.Now, with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, we spend a decent amount of time establishing this whimsical movie about a poor boy named Charlie but, once Depp is introduced, the focus shifts to him. If any movie should be called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory it should be this one.Depp's representation of Willy Wonka makes me really uncomfortable. He seems to be channeling Michael Jackson but, doesn't the whole pedophile thing color this in an odd way? I mean, Wonka is inviting half a dozen children into his mysterious wonderland for a contest for which only he knows the rules. Sure we get to see Wonka's backstory (to explain his childlike nature) but that juice ain't worth the squeeze. I was attempting a more candy oriented phrase, but that's all I could think of. I have pages of moleskine notebook notes about what I didn't like about this movie and why and how but, then, last night I re-watched Ratatouille. I'll go into more details about the plot but, for our purposes here, the main villain in Ratatouille is a food critic named Anton Ego.At one point he says, 'In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so...'The above quote makes me wonder about movies like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. There are plenty of movies out there and even plenty of fun bad movies. I can even see having a fondness for bad movies (even if they aren't fun). That said, I'm recommend avoiding Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. If you want some whimsy, why not go to watch one of Tim Burton's older movies? And if you want some Chocolate Factory, I'd recommend the original film, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.Thanks for reading!",1,3,5,27 July 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars: The Force Awakens was awesome; you don't have to be a Star Wars fan (you don't even have to have seen any of the other movies) to enjoy it.
","Sometimes, when I write a movie review, I struggle to find a starting point. Some movies require a little background or description to help illustrate my points. It can be a pain if the movie is bad or convoluted. It's worse in the case of the latter because I risk giving away too much of the plot. Fortunately for me, Star Wars: The Force Awakens does not fall into these categories. I don't have to say very much at all about the plot to recommend it to you. In fact, I don't think I'll even go into the plot at all for my review.Just about everything in this movie is wonderful. John Williams is back with another solid score (though it struck me again how his scores all sound the same). The dialog was solid. The graphics and special effects were splendid. (I've come to associate J.J. Abrams with his sense of moderation and taste). There are little bits of fan service (that is, stuff for returning fans) but it doesn't get in the way. New characters and worlds were introduced smoothly and blended well with the returning characters.The weakest part of Star Wars: The Force Awakens was the two-dimensional villains. Now, don't get me wrong, this is going to be a trilogy but they still could've made the villains compelling, rather than hinting at a future back-story. That said, all the other characters were perfectly fine. I especially liked Harrison Ford's return as the dashing rogue Han Solo. It was his most vitalized performance in quite a while.I've also got to hand it to the merchandising powerhouse that is Disney. Everything in this movie, from the light-sabers and the blasters to the revamped X-Wings, can be turned into something to buy. At one point, a character jumps in a Tie Fighter and says, 'I've always wanted to fly one of these.' 'Me too,' says I. Thank goodness I can in the new Star Wars: Battlefront III for the PS4! Han Solo shoots Chewie's crossbow, looks down at it, turns and says, 'I gotta get me one of these.''Can I have one of those too, Dad? And Kylo Ren's light-saber too!' Does this diminish the movie? Absolutely not, I just thought it was funny to see.Now, I was never the biggest fan of Star Wars. It's not that I dislike them I've just never really liked them. That said, I loved Star Wars: The Force Awakens. I've seen this twice so far and it got me pumped up each time. It made me want to go on an adventure. I wanted to fly around in space ships. Heck, I wanted to just be a part of the movie making process.At this point, just about everyone on earth has seen Star Wars: The Force Awakens but if you haven't, I highly recommend you do. The people I've met who haven't seen it explain that they aren't Star Wars fans. I assure you, you don't have to be a Star Wars fan to enjoy it. It's fun if you are a Star Wars fan so you get some of the references but that's just icing on the cake.",9,1,22,5 April 2016
Spectre," Spectre is one of the most generic and bland Bond films I've seen; there's really no reason to see it.
","Daniel Craig returns to his role as the International Man of Mystery super spy James Bond in Spectre. Spectre is the name of a super secret evil organization. I believe the organization first appeared in Thunderball (1965) but it never became more than an occasional reference. In this iteration of the franchise, however, Bond has to take the villainous conglomerate head on and, let me tell you, he does so with an unbridled lackadaisy.Quite honestly, there isn't anything noteworthy about Spectre. It's almost like the filmmakers said, 'Alright, well, we don't have any ideas for James Bond right now so let's just have him go after that big villain organization. What was the name of it? Octopus? Ghost? Oh yeah, Spectre!' It comes across as a poor attempt to increase the stakes. It seems silly though, after all, a poker game could be made exciting; it's all about how you do it. But, in any case, artificially making the stakes bigger (or attempting to) happens throughout the movie: Bond gets a fancy new Aston Martin DB10 (made especially for this movie), he uncovers secrets about his upbringing, and in the introduction, he blows up an entire city block. All this and it still falls flat.It seems like everyone involved phoned in for this film. I'm not just talking about the performances. Consider the one of the main subplots for this film. The 00 program is being phased out by a new department of the government that focuses on having a complete digital surveillance network cough NSA cough. 'Is the 00 Program too old fashioned?' Now, wait a sec. The plot for Skyfall (a previous Daniel Craig-Bond movie) focused heavily on the government questioning the relevancy of the 00 program too.One of Spectre's the colorful villains is the assassin Hinx played by Dave Bautista. He's a giant guy with metal thumbnails. Have the villains always been this silly?Odd Job - a nigh unintelligible body guard who throws a metal bowler. Jaws - a giant tough guy who has metal teeth. Pussy Galore - a woman actually named Pussy Galore.Alright, alright. Maybe this villain wasn't that sillySo, in the interest of our discussion, let me get to some spoilers so we can really talk about this move. In sum, don't see Spectre. If you're a Bond fan, I'm sure you've already seen this but if you haven't, don't worry about it; there are plenty of other, better Bond movies. Maybe it was a shift in tone. Up to this point, Daniel Craig as James Bond was super serious Bond, but from the cheesy lines, to the weak dialog, Spectre feels like a poorly executed throwback. Now, let's get to some nittygritty details (mind yourself of spoilers).Let's consider Christoph Waltz's character and his catchphrase. The scene is set for a sinister villain meeting; villainous figures sit in a big room discussing recent successful assassinations. A big door opens and, shrouded in darkness, the ringleader enters. Yadda yadda yadda the villain welcomes the hitherto hidden James Bond (to the shock of no one but James). The villain sits forward into the light, looks menacingly up at James and says 'Cuckoo.' Clearly, that's supposed to be a villainous catch phrase but it isn't very successful.Now, in much the same way that I looked at other Bond henchmen, the catch phrases from James Bond characters aren't the best; lot's of innuendo or little singers. The first example that comes to mind is a fight scene where a thug falls into a bath tub. Acting quickly, Bond throws a lamp into the water and electrocutes the baddie. Bond looks and says, 'Shocking.' It's quick, cheesy, but it does it's job. To understand what 'cuckoo' means, we have to wait the entire movie until the villain gives an extended monologue (according to IMDb):Blofeld: You know what happens when a cuckoo hatches inside another bird's nest? Madeleine Swann: Yes. It forces the other eggs out. Blofeld: Yes. Well, this cuckoo made me realize my father's life had to end. In a way he's responsible for the path I took... (to Bond) Blofeld: So thank you, cuckoo!'Cuckoo'? More like 'contrived.' But seriously, it feels like a plot device that the writers thought would be totally cool because it bookends the interactions between the characters. Only the movie goes on for another half hour. Moreover, it's meaningless without the explanation and, once provided, doesn't feel satisfying.One last point, that I'd like to bring up is the intro sequence. The Bond franchise is famous (or infamous) for it's introductions. They are always stylized in a way that fits into the movie. Consider the theme for Casino Royale. The main plot device in the film is a poker game so the intro features bullets in the shapes of spades piercing figures who fall apart into little hearts, etc. They can be enjoyable because sometimes they foreshadow the movie.In line with the rest of the film, Spectre's intro is lame. I was going to try and find a more sophisticated word but lame works. Instead of being stylized in a neat way, it's just clear images of Bond, women and nigh literal scenes of the preceding film, with the modification of octopi. Instead of a bikini – an octopus is wrapped around a woman's body. Instead of a pillar – a tentacle. Instead of shadow cast by a hand - it's an octopus. I mean, I get it guys, the mascot of the secrete organization is an octopus but sheesh, let's tone it down a little.So, what do you think? Did you see Spectre? Follow up question if you have, are you a fan of Bond movies? Let me know in the comments below! Thanks for reading!",2,9,17,19 May 2016
