Hereditary," Shame on you !
","I don't write reviews but WOW - this was really bad.There's nothing scary in this one. NOTHING. Why is this advertised as being 'horror' ? It's not even a thriller ,the story is TOO fragmented and too slow.Going to the cinema is a gamble now.I feel bad for supporting this SCAM !",1,4,9,5 July 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Got tricked by the rating
",Can't believe this movie has such a high rating.Just watched Destroyer and this one is boring as hell.Gave it a 1 to cover some of those fanboys over here.,1,20,42,13 February 2019
Dunkirk," Disappointed
","This film is about how the British troops cowardly and shamefully fled the battlefield. This film is about how they threw their French allies when the Germans split them into two parts in France. There is nothing more disgraceful than running away from the battlefield! A movie about cowards, a movie about cowardice! However, like the whole history of Britain ..ï»¿.I wanted to like this movie because of NOLAN ,but i really can't.Hacksaw Ridge is the better war movie.",2,13,29,21 July 2017
