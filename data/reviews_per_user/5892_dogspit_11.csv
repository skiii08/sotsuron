Casablanca," '...as time goes by.'
","I just watched this film again for the first time in years and was reminded just why it is considered so great. Bogart & Bergman were incredible as was the entire cast, I especially love Peter Lorre's rather shortlived role in it. Everyone talks about the love story, but to me it is Rick's transformation from bitterness and apathy to the noble hero that makes Casablanca. And the music that knits the film together is superb. As time goes by this film only grows in stature, a true classic in every sense.",9,0,0,2 January 2003
Minority Report," Merely good.
","The concept of a criminal system that prevents crime before it happens made this film watchable. Tom Cruise did a good job in a one-dimensional role and the special effects were great, but I expected far more from Spielberg.",7,0,0,26 December 2002
Se7en," Deliciously dark...
",I like this film more with each viewing. Brad Pitt & Morgan Freeman are both superb as a pair of detectives on the trail of serial killer John Doe (Kevin Spacey). The film is rich in imagery and graphic in its depiction of violence. The story is great and kept me guessing till the end. A must see work. 10/10,10,0,1,31 January 2003
Citizen Kane," Not worthy of it's hype!
","I think it is less than coincidental that Rosebud is an anagram for 'bored us'. From the beginning with its 12 minute plus faux newsreel screamed in an annoying voice, till its trite ending this film bored me. Though much of the cinematography was exceptional, the story, the acting, and even the makeup (check out the horrid goop plastered on his face near the end of the film) were all mediocre. If you are looking for entertaining classic cinema of the 40's, do yourself a favor, look elsewhere!",4,5,12,5 January 2003
Forrest Gump," 'Superb is as superb does'
","Forrest Gump is a masterpiece. Watching the remarkable life of a simple man woven through the tapestry of recent American history makes this film among my favorites. Tom Hanks is totally believable in the title role, and Robin Wright & Gary Sinise are both great. What really makes this movie stand out though is the way Forrest's life is inserted into so many historic events...George Wallace trying to stop integration in Little Rock, Vietnam protests in Washington D.C., and (my favorite) the Watergate break-in are among them. The use of digital effects in archival footage is done better than I have seen it before. A great story, filmed superbly, and filled with great acting, this is as good as it gets. 10 out of 10!",10,0,3,8 January 2003
Men in Black II," Men in Blah
","This movie was bad from start to finish. Lots of creatures, but the same old story and nothing particularly funny. The highlight was a cameo by Michael Jackson (yes he was the scariest looking creature in the film). I kept waiting for something good, but it just did not happen. Will Smith was boring, as was Lara Flynn Boyle, and Tommy Lee Jones simply could not rescue such a dismal effort.",3,0,0,10 December 2002
Reservoir Dogs," Violence incarnate !!! (SPOILER)
","Referring to Reservoir Dogs as very violent would be an understatement. From start to finish this film is packed with violence & blood. If you like the violent action genre you will absolutely love it (I sure do)! Tarantino has packed this one with an all-star cast including Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, & Steve Buscemi. The soundtrack is a very good mix of 70's pop music. The scene in which Mr. Blonde tortures a cop is accented by the delightful 'Stuck in the Middle With You' by Stealer's Wheel. This film is a first class bloodfest !!!",8,0,1,13 January 2003
Eyes Wide Shut," Eyes bored shut...
","There was very little I liked about this film. Knowing it was a Kubrick work I expected something great, but instead got a poorly acted, boring 'drama' with soap opera dialog. Neither Cruise or Kidman did a good job in a story that was tenuous at best. The worst part was a score which included the most annoying piano sounds (ostensibly for suspense) that were like fingernails scratching a chalkboard. Only the cinematography stood out in this otherwise lackluster and trite piece of cinematic drivel.",4,0,1,16 March 2003
Pulp Fiction," '...one tasty burger!'
","Incredible film which I love in so many ways. From the quirky way several seemingly disjointed stories come together, the sarcastic humor, the gratuitous (but delectable) violence, and even the soundtrack. Samuel L. Jackson & Bruce Willis are both brilliant in a film which is more than just a must watch, but a most watch over and over addition to any film collection. 10 of 10!",10,1,2,27 December 2002
The Great Escape," 'Truly a great escape'
","This is a great movie, based on a true World War II escape. The set is superb, based on the actual design of Stalag Luft 3 where the escape took place. The cast is an all-star one including Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, & James Garner. It has a bit of everything you could want..humor, compassion, and even a great motorcycle chase scene. The movie is almost three hours long, so pop some popcorn, settle in, and prepare to enjoy yourself immensely.",9,1,2,2 February 2003
Windtalkers," Watchable war flick
","Roger Willie & Adam Beach turn in good performances in this film about the Navajo code talkers in World War II. The backdrop is breathtaking and the action is quite good. The normally sharp Nicolas Cage turns in a rather stiff, uninspired performance, but it is still a very enjoyable film, especially for fans of war movies.",7,0,1,9 December 2002
