The New World," Beautifully shot but long.
","'The New World' (2005) is a film that can best be described as a sight to see but not to feel. The latest film by director Terrence Malick, the cinematography (by Emmanuel Lubezki) is so exquisite that this film's only Oscar nomination was for just that. This cinematography makes you feel as if there was still a world of the early 1600s out there in our present world. Also a highlight is newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher as the legendary Pocahontas - her innocence and wonder of the world is shown dramatically and wonderfully through Kilcher's eyes and performance. The same can't be said about two great actors: Colin Farrell's performance as Captain John Smith nor Christian Bale as John Rolfe but then again they weren't given much to do with their roles either. Not only that, the film is very long. So long that sometimes your mind will wander. And for this main reason I cannot give the film more than a 6 out of 10. But I would still recommend it as a viewing experience of early American history.",6,0,4,6 September 2006
Mission: Impossible III," Excellent!
","Another great 'Mission: Impossible' film (the 3rd one so far), this time with more punch than the second film and on the same level as the first. Tom Cruise again returns as Ethan Hunt (with the same hairstyle as the first film) and Ving Rhames also returns as Luther Strickell. Keri Russell makes a great addition to the cast. I was slightly disappointed with Philip Seymour Hoffman as the villain Owen Davian (not because of him, because I think he's a great actor, but the script didn't call for any character development). J.J Abrahams, the creator of 'Lost' and 'Alias', does a superb job in his feature film debut - he knows how to pack the punch with the action sequences. The score is also top-notch - by up-and-coming composer Michael Giacchino. This is a highly recommended film - a very strong 8 out of 10.",8,4,7,7 May 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Average Flick
","After the original trilogy, I was eagerly awaiting this new installment in the Star Wars saga that was 16 years in the making . . . but I must admit, I was disappointed. Not that The Phantom Menace is a bad film, but it certainly isn't on the same leave as the Original Trilogy. For instance, there's too much exposition (too much dialogue and politics and little action). But ironically, this is to be expected. Whereas the Original Trilogy is about the Rebels who are continually evading the dreaded Empire (which brought a sense of danger everywhere they turned), this new film is about a government that's already in place where everyone has gone complacent. This makes for no sense of danger (everyone is new, the colors are vivid - compare that to the Original Trilogy where everything is faded and old) - in fact, the incident surrounding this film centers around a trade embargo on a wayward planet. Because the story is weak, the dialogue, acting, music (which is still great John Williams, just not on par with his Original Trilogy music), etc. all unfortunately suffer. There is also an over-reliance on CGI. All in all, a 6 out of 10.",6,0,1,3 December 2005
50 First Dates," Funny if not memorable
","50 First Dates is a funny comedy that doesn't deviate from the Hollywood standard. This makes it a standard comedy that can be appreciated for just that. It's fun to see Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore in their respective roles, since I enjoy both actors in most movies they have done. They are able take the standard dialogue written for this movie and make it somewhat enjoyable because of the interaction of the two actors works. I must also mention that Lusia Strus who plays Alexa is quite funny in her role even though the jokes centered around her is quite predictable. But sometimes, predictable (aka staying safe) can work and it does most of the time in funny ways. A solid enough 7 out of 10.",7,1,2,20 December 2005
The Ring," Excellent Horror Film
","The Ring is an excellent horror film - an adaptation of the brilliant Japanese film Ringu. Gore Verbinski does a great job directing this film, with an excellent performance by Naomi Watts and newcomer David Dorfman (he's the next big horror kid actor - after Haley Joel Osment). The reason I like this horror film is precisely because it's not B-movie style blood and guts horror - rather a smartly scripted psychological horror which only shows the scary elements when it is necessary and thus creates suspense (the same happened with Spielberg's Jaws - he smartly didn't 'show' the shark until the very end of the film). Bring on The Ring 2! A solid 8 out of 10.",8,0,1,24 December 2005
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Spectacular to say the least
","Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the best films of director Steven Spielberg and storyteller George Lucas, if not one of the best films of all time. Almost everyone knows the classic tale of Indiana Jones so I don't have to regale you with the story. Suffice it to say, Harrison Ford is PERFECTLY cast as the title character Indiana Jones (I can't imagine any other actor in this role). John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody (both will make welcome returns in The Last Crusade), and Karen Allen as Marion are all great in the supporting roles. Also look out for Alfred Molina in a great performance at the beginning of the film (he is probably better known as the Spiderman 2 villain Doc Ock. Also a great score by maestro John Williams (one of his best for sure!). And of course look out for the snake scene! A spectacular 9 out of 10!",9,2,4,24 January 2006
Akira," Classic Japanese Anime!
","Akira, a film by director Katsuhiro Ôtomo, is classic Japanese Anime. This is truly a stand-out film that is very Japanese in nature - it is both ethereal in its story with a social commentary on the effects of nuclear weapons (this isn't surprising since Japan is the only country that suffered the effects of nuclear weapons in the form of the atomic blasts at Hiroshima and Nagasaki). I would also want to mention that while this is a great film for adults, parents beware - this is definitely not a film for kids (there is both realistic gore and nudity as would be in live action films). However, for adults, this is a great anime film - a solid 8 out of 10.",8,0,2,26 December 2005
Underworld," Very well done
","Underworld, is a standout film by director Len Wiseman. Although the story is somewhat uninspired, but this can be forgiven because every other element was top-notch. This includes the proper casting and performance of the main character Selene, by relative newcomer Kate Beckinsale, who dons a spectacular looking costume - she is now guaranteed to be forever immortalized as a toy figure (like the Star Wars characters before her)! Considering also that this film was made for $22 million, I'm really amazed how well they used the budget to make this film look like $50 million at least (sadly, the sequel Underworld: Evolution will have a budget of $50 million yet look just as good as this film). The filmmakers were really innovative with this film and made this into a gem. Definitely worth watching at 8 out of 10 (watch out for the uninspired sequel though).",8,0,0,27 January 2006
The 13th Warrior," Enjoyable
","The 13th Warrior was a very enjoyable film if not unforgettable. I would consider this film slightly above the standard action fare because of a great performance by Antonio Banderas (with the longest name I've ever heard - Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan Ibn Al Abbas Ibn Rashid Ibn Hamad!) I must also mention that I read the book first (called Eaters of the Dead) which is MUCH better than the movie, but in some ways that is to be expected since the books can go deeper into the thoughts of the characters than film ever can. Also the book makes me believe what happened in AD 922 was for sure based on fact (as the book states) rather than if I just watched the movie. I also didn't like the fact that the movie didn't mention that these Eaters could have been Neandrathals (which made the book an enjoyable read). All in all, a 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,20 December 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Wasn't bad.
","'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest', the sequel to 'Curse of the Black Pearl', is an entertaining if average action adventure film. The same swashbuckling style returns, as well as the filmmakers including Gore Verbinski (who directed this film back to back with the 3rd film coming out in 2007). And again, Johnny Depp is superb as Captain Jack Sparrow, and unfortunately again, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley return as his co-stars (like the first film, their presence is FAR overshadowed by Depp and their so-so performances can't compare to his). This film I guess had the feel of 'I've been there before' from other action-adventure and other pirate movies. Not great but not bad either. Would recommend - 7 out of 10.",7,1,4,13 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Funny
","There is only one real reason I liked this film and can be summed up in two words - Johnny Depp. He really made the film what it is - a funny action adventure. In fact, although the the main focus seems to be around Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley's characters (and their romance which was not very believable), Johnny Depp's Capt. Jack Sparrow was the real focus and what a riot he is! The visual effects was pretty good too. Other than that though, the story itself is okay (I thought Cutthroat Island had a better story and that's saying much) and the music was average (Hans Zimmer has done better - i.e. The Lion King). But still see this film because of Johnny Depp, actor extraordinaire!",7,0,2,2 December 2005
Hostel," A shocker of a film.
","'Hostel' (2005) is the latest film by 'Cabin Fever' director Eli Roth. One thing I can say about this film is the gore, gore, gore! There's a lot of it so this movie isn't for the squeamish. Along with lots of T/A, this film is a horror fan's treat. Taking place in exotic Amsterdam, the film takes time to get going (about 30 minutes to get to the gore), but once there, it's one helluva ride! Though the dialogue doesn't really hold merit and the script is also somewhat predictable, Jay Hernandez (of 'World Trade Center' fame) does a great job in the lead role as Paxton (one of two friends from America in Amsterdam on vacation). What happens to him and his friend is so frightening and sickening, you have to see the film to believe it. A shocker of a film - at 7 out 10.",7,1,1,17 September 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," For children only
","I just finished watching The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and I must say I came out feeling a bit let down. Perhaps it has more to do with the fact that I'm grown up and therefore expect more than a children's story. And don't get me wrong, it's not a bad film - but like I said, it's for children only(unlike the Harry Potter films which can be enjoyed by both children AND adults, including yours truly). And certain parts of the film reminded me too much of The Lord of the Rings, especially the battle sequences. Even some of the creatures in this film seem to come straight out of The Lord of the Rings (this isn't all too surprising if you know that WETA, the company that did the visual effects for The Lord of the Rings, also did it for this film). Overall, a 6 out of 10. Hopefully the next one will be more interesting and adult-pleasing.",6,0,1,27 December 2005
The Notebook," True romance.
","'The Notebook' (2004) is a wonderfully romantic film directed adeptly by Nick Cassavetes. While the script is somewhat predictable (I mean who can't figure out the elder couple played by James Garner and Gena Rowlands is really the younger couple as told when they were younger in the 1940s). But it is the acting from the aforementioned veteran actors and the younger couple themselves - Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams - which really make this picture work. It's a pleasure to watch these four interplay throughout the film - thereby making the predictability okay in my book. On top of that, the cinematography is exceptional and mesmerizing. All in all, a wonderful 8 out of 10.",8,1,3,17 September 2006
Spider-Man 2," Far superior to the original film
","Spider-man 2 is a great film, far superior to the first Spider-man (which was a good film in its own right). Again, Sam Raimi helms this Spider-man adventure, this time with a stronger script and superior dialogue. It's because he focuses on Peter Parker's humanity and the fact he has the weaknesses of any normal human being, it makes us associate closer with Spider-man and all his perils. The same couldn't be said for Batman until Batman Begins was made (since that was the first film that actually explored Bruce Wayne and why he became the way he is). Also, unlike the first Spider-man, this time the title character is given a better villain - in the form of Alfred Molina as Doc Ock/Dr. Otto Octavius. I really look forward to Spider-man 3 now! A very strong 9 out of 10.",9,0,1,27 December 2005
Batman Returns," Way Darker
","Batman Returns is a way darker version of Batman than the original. It is dark and nihilistic, but this necessarily isn't a bad thing. I actually like this version, since Batman is supposed to be the DARK Knight. There are two more memorable villains, Danny Devito as the Penguin, and especially Michelle Pfeiffer as the slinky and sexy Catwoman. Not only that, the special effects, production design (who wouldn't want the Batmobile!), and music score by Danny Elfman are top notch. But AGAIN, there is absolutely no character development for the hero of this film Batman, with the villains again both getting back stories as to why they become who they are. We will have to wait until the 5th installment of Batman (2005's Batman Begins) to finally learn why Bruce Wayne became Batman. Regardless, coming from auteur Tim Burton, Batman Returns is overall a spectacular film. Solid 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,2 December 2005
Alexander," Below Average
","Alexander is supposedly the 15 year pet project of director Oliver Stone so I have to ask . . . what happened? This is definitely Oliver's worst film to date if not one of the worst films I have seen recently. The story is so dis-jointed (including the action sequences which are presented as confusing at best - I couldn't tell during one of the first battles against the Persian Empire which direction the fighting was going on or who was who at certain points!), Colin Farrel was an okay Alexander, and Angelina Jolie was an unbelievable 'mother' of Colin (considering their age difference is only 1 year!) - as a side note, her Transylvanian accent in this film was completely unrealistic for her character. The 175 minute length also is a negative. Oh, and that paper mache statue of Val Kilmer is silly if not funny (but not funny in a good way)! 4 out of 10.",4,2,4,20 December 2005
The Mummy," Just great!
","The Mummy is a classic-style action film which doesn't take itself too seriously (and in this case that style works!). Director Stephen Sommers hits mostly the right marks in this film (and the same can be said for the sequel The Mummy Returns). I love the character interaction between actors Brendan Frasier and Rachel Weisz, with John Hannah providing the proper comic relief, Oded Fehr as the wise warrior, and Arnold Vosloo as an imposing title character. And I would like to mention the incredible and superior score by film composer legend Jerry Goldsmith - this is one of his best in his career (matching his scores for Star Trek The Motion Picture and Total Recall in its uniqueness). A great 8 out of 10 adventure!",8,0,0,24 December 2005
Brokeback Mountain," Beautiful
","Brokeback Mountain is a very well done film, directed by master director Ang Lee (of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon fame). After the dismal Hulk, he returns in top form for this film. What really makes this film work is the proper casting of the main characters played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, whose chemistry really works and is believable. The cinematography also is top notch, with the mountain vistas looking either beautiful and serene or at other times dark and dismal, which symbolically represents how the main characters feel about each other at any one time. A must see for sure - a definite 9 out of 10.",9,19,23,23 January 2006
X-Men," A good introduction
","Bryan Singer introduces us to the world of 'X-Men' in a mostly successful way. The film is properly cast - with a special mention for Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier (one of my favorite actors) and Hugh Jackman as Logan/Wolverine. However, the other areas are less than par (including a silly costume for Magneto - what's with his helmet?) and a so-so score by the late Maestro Michael Kamen (FYI, I do enjoy his scores for the Die Hard and Lethal Weapon films but in this case, it was not very memorable). If you want to see a great X-Men movie, I suggest renting the sequel X2 (which was properly done by Bryan Singer). For this outing however, an above average 7 out of 10 for a good introduction to a memorable superhero series.",7,0,0,24 December 2005
Match Point," Must-see film.
","'Match Point' (2005) is the latest film by famed director/actor Woody Allen. This wonderful film find its strengths in the acting - mainly between Jonathan Rhys Meyers as the British Chris Wilton who must decide between marrying into richness or going out with the American wannabe-actress Nola Rice (played expertly by Scarlett Johansson). The story also has a very smart twist at the end of the film - won't give it away but it does involve a ring. This film also marks a different take for Woody Allen - this film not only takes place in Britain instead of New York, but also is very serious in its subject matter. Definitely a must-see film - at 8 out of 10.",8,0,2,20 September 2006
Crash," Must-see film.
","'Crash' (2004), the 2006 winner for Best Picture, deserves every bit of that honor. Directed by Paul Haggis (who helped write the upcoming James Bond film 'Casino Royale'), it is a masterful direction that really works due to its intelligent and evenly-paced script (also an Oscar winner for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen) dealing with racial issues in Los Angeles, as well as the right ensemble cast to tackle the subject matter. Of the actors, the best ones are Don Cheadle as Det. Graham Waters, Terrence Howard as the studio director Cameron Thayer (he also won this year for Best Actor in another film 'Hustle & Flow'), and Thandie Newton as his wife. You will never look at Los Angeles the same way again. A 9 out of 10.",9,1,10,11 September 2006
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A fitting ending
","Return of the Jedi is the third film to be made in the Star Wars saga but the sixth film chronologically and hence the last of the films. This means that it must wrap up the loose ends we've seen in the first 5 films. And it does. By seeing this film, it shows that the entire saga is really about Anakin Skywalker and his ultimate redemption in this film. Even though there are some repetitious elements (a second Death Star?), times of tired acting (Harrison Ford is really given very little to do in this film - and even he shows it when he is leaning against an Endor tree BORED waiting for Luke and Leia to return from their speedbiker chase), and introduction of the appalling cute factor (Ewoks, Ewoks, Ewoks!), there are also ingenious new additions like Jabba the Hutt and the Emperor we'll come to know in the prequel films. And the final Battle of Endor is a classic finish to a classic saga! For sure, a solid 8 out of 10.",8,2,5,3 December 2005
Scary Movie 2," Not very funny
","Scary Movie 2, again directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans and written by Shawn and Marlon Wayans, isn't as good as the original film. The script this time seems to have been hastily written so it could make its release date (they only had a year to make this 2001 film after the 2000 release of the original). Because of this, the dialogue is sub-par with the jokes either a rehash of the original, overly raunchy as to be very unfunny, or just plain dumb. The only real highlights are Anna Faris as Cindy Campbell and Regina Hall as Brenda Meeks (they are the highlights of all 3 Scary Movie films so far). Sadly, even the James Woods cameo as Father McFeely (in an unoriginal Excorsist spoof) isn't worth watching. An average 5 out of 10.",5,0,1,30 December 2005
Capote," Inspiring film.
","'Capote' (2005) is an inspiring film. Directed masterfully by Bennett Miller, it tells of the story of Truman Capote (played expertly by Philip Seymour Hoffman in an Oscar-winning performance) as he develops a close relationship with a killer who would inspire his famous novel 'In Cold Blood'. Also inspirational in performance is Catherine Keener as 'To Kill A Mockingbird' novelist Harper Lee and their 'relationship' together. The story and script are also top-notch (which also earned an Oscar-nomination for the writer Dan Futterman ) as well as the subtle score Mychael Danna. This is truly a must-see film if only to see Hoffman tackle the complex character of Capote. A 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,11 September 2006
The Devil Wears Prada," GREAT film!
","'The Devil Wears Prada' (2006), directed by David Frankel, is a masterful film, very hilarious and smart. It works primarily because of the two lead actresses, Merryl Streep (always great of course but more so here as Miranda Priestly, the perfectionistic and dictatorial head of a fashion magazine) and Anne Hathaway (in a very superb performance as Andy Sachs, who having no idea of fashion, decides to interview for the position of Miranda's assistant). These performances are just excellent and really makes it a pleasure to watch the sharp dialogue being said in an intelligent story. A real must-see - a fashionable 9 out of 10!",9,1,2,24 August 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," SLIGHTLY better than The Phantom Menace
","After the dismal Phantom Menace, I thought once you hit rock bottom, you can only go up. And I was partially right. Just like The Phantom Menace, this film suffers from weak dialogue (especially in the romance sequences) rather flat acting (especially from Hayden Christensen - whose performance FYI will thankfully improve in Revenge of the Sith), and an over-reliance on CGI. However, the film is more in line with the Original Trilogy (i.e. we see primitive Star Destroyers and Storm Troopers), the music is better soley because of a beautifully constructed new theme by John Williams (Across The Stars - the Love Theme for Anakin and Padme). And the last 45 minutes is what we come to expect from Star Wars - the action-packed Battle of Geonosis. For that reason, I give this an above average rating - 7 out of 10.",7,0,1,3 December 2005
Corpse Bride," Not Burton's best but still good
","Being an avid fan, especially his previous animated venture, The Nightmare Before Christmas (which he co-wrote), I went into the theaters for this film with eager anticipation. After watching it, I'm afraid to admit, it was an okay outing for Tim Burton. That said, it isn't bad by any stretch of the word, just not his best. I really like the fact he is still working with Michael Gough (the beloved Alfred he worked with in the original Batman and its sequel), the animation was just as good as in the aforementioned The Nightmare Before Christmas, and Danny Elfman's music was again much appreciated (since Tim Burton and Danny Elfman are one of the ultimate film-making dynamic duos). However, the story was quite predictable (at least for me as I watch a lot of films). The Burton magic is still there though and I look forward to his next film.",7,0,1,2 December 2005
Fargo," Great film even after 10 years.
","'Fargo', a film by the Coen Brothers, is one great film, one that stands the test of time (being timeless even after 10 years). The strengths of this film lies with the screenplay, story, and the actors. Combined together, you get a classic dark comedy. Of special note are actors Frances McDormand as the pregnant Officer Marge Gunderson who spearheads the murder case that this film revolves around. She lives a very stable life with a happy and complacent marriage to her husband, about to have their first child. It's as if this role was created for McDormand, for she is a pleasure to watch. Also kudos to William H. Macy and Steve Buscemi who are great in their roles too. Without giving more away, all I will say is go see this film. You won't be disappointed at all - a still-strong 9 out of 10!",9,0,0,31 August 2006
The Aviator," Nice job Scorcese!
","The Aviator, one of the newer films by Martin Scorcese, is a knock out classic film by the directing genius. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, who before this movie I haven't really taken seriously (I mean, he was okay in Titanic, but I never considered him a great actor) - but in this film, he really authentically portrayed Howard Hughes and his various ticks that is was amazing. A very well done performance. Cate Blanchett also deserves kudos for a realistic portrayal of Katherine Hepburn (RIP). The score by Howard Shore also deserves special mention - he created another classic musical theme (as he did repeatedly with the Lord of the Rings trilogy) - I look forward to this composer's future ventures. Overall, with a strong script, beautiful production design, and the aforementioned pluses, this is a must see - 8 out of 10.",8,0,1,6 March 2006
American Pie," Very funny and outrageous!
","American Pie is a very funny and outrageous film by writer Adam Herz, with Paul Weitz expertly directing the properly cast actors. These actors include Jason Biggs, whose main character Jim Levenstein is one of the funniest and awkward teenagers I've ever seen on screen. Other kudos go to actors Alyson Hannigan as Jim's love interest Michelle Flaherty, Seann William Scott as Jim's funny friend Stifler, and especially the very funny Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad! This is definitely the definitive growing up story for the late 1990s generation. Be sure to not only watch this but the other two direct sequels. A hilarious romp at 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,27 December 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A great start to a classic trilogy
","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, begins what is destined to be one of the greatest trilogies of all time (rivaling the original Star Wars and the Back to the Future trilogies). It's very obvious that the director Peter Jackson is very passionate about the material, and after seeing his earlier 1994 film, Heavenly Creatures, proved he was the actor's director. The performances are top-notch in properly cast roles (Ian McKellen really stands out as Gandalf in this film and the two sequels). The production and visual effects design is heavenly, and Howard Shore's score rivals that of John Williams' Star Wars score in its ingenuity and complexity. The only complaint I have is that it has no ending with only an Act 1 (but that only makes sense since this film is considered the Act 1 - Act 2 and 3 would be the sequels). An almost perfect 9 out of 10.",9,1,2,24 December 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," A fitting ending to a classic trilogy
","The Matrix Revolutions, the third part of Andy and Larry Wachowski's Matrix trilogy, fittingly ends what will be considered in the near future as one of cinema's classic trilogies. Though this third outing into the Matrix universe is the weakest of the three films, it's still an outstanding film with a great ending. Unlike part 2, this film has character development giving the main characters (Neo, Trinity, Morpheus, as well as new characters Link and Niobe) something to do with their characters. Although I am disappointed that most of the film doesn't take place in the Matrix itself, if you look at the structure of the trilogy, it does make sense and I respect the Wachowskis for sticking with their vision even if they did alienate some of their core audience. Again, Don Davis' score is superb (not as good as Reloaded's score but nearly up there and definitely better than his first Matrix score). This is a fitting 7 out of 10 and a must-see, if only to see how the Matrix trilogy ends.",7,0,0,27 December 2005
The Village," M. Night Shyamalan's worst so far
","The Village is where M. Night Shyamalan was bound to go like other great directors have gone before - to a so-so film. This is definitely not one of Shyamalan's best and it mostly has to do with the fact that the script was very predictable and though it's as slow as his previous films, because the script suffers, so does the pacing. The only real plus to this average thriller is newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard (daughter of actor turned director Ron Howard) whose superior acting as blind Ivy Walker shows that M. Night Shyamalan still has what it takes when it comes to directing actors. I look forward to his next film, Lady in the Water. However, this time, only a 6 out of 10.",6,0,0,25 December 2005
Pitch Black," Great science fiction!
","Pitch Black, a film by director David Twohy, is a spot on science fiction film that any person would enjoy. The performances are excellent here, especially by relative newcomer Vin Diesel (this film would help propel him to super stardom). It takes place on an interesting location - a desert planet which never sees darkness - except when there are eclipses every 22 years (and of course an eclipse is approaching!) - and when it does see darkness, strange flying creatures make their vicious debut to our main characters. A strong film all the way through (unfortunately the same cannot be said about its sequel, The Chronicles of Riddick). A strong 8 out of 10.",8,0,1,24 December 2005
Little Miss Sunshine," Cute and funny.
","'Little Miss Sunshine' (2006), the new film by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris is a pleasure to watch. It's also one of the best films of the year (so far). The story revolves around a family getting their daughter Olive (whose about 10 years old) across country to California to star in a Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant and in the process of this journey, come to learn about themselves and what life really means. This heartfelt and funny journey is highlighted by the acting (above par from ALL of the cast including Greg Kinnear as the father Richard and the '40 year old Virgin' Steve Carell as the brother in law Frank). And look out for their yellow VW van! A sight to see of a movie - a 9 out of 10!",9,2,5,1 September 2006
Van Helsing," Above average
","Stephen Sommer, of The Mummy and The Mummy Returns fame, directs his next big adventure, Van Helsing with Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckingsale in the lead roles. Just like The Mummy, Van Helsing is an above action action flick that works on most levels, even though the film isn't excellent by any means. What's really missing for me are strong performances and a solid score (as Alan Silvestri provided for The Mummy Returns). However, the story concept is interesting, combining horror legends Count Dracula, Frankenstein Monster, and The Wolf Man into one film. That in itself makes this movie a curiosity to see, if only for just one viewing. Above average, 7 out of 10.",7,2,4,2 December 2005
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Hilairous
","THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN is an incredible funny film, mostly because of the lead character, Steve Carrell (Andy), who also co-wrote. He is VERY believable as a 40 year old virgin who REALLY wants to get some but can't bring himself to do so (because of horrible sexual experiences in his past - which are shown nicely in flashbacks). While the story is somewhat predictable - I knew he would end up with Catherine Keener (Trish) right off the bat when she walked into the electronics store and gave her number to Andy. It was obvious that Andy would take his own advice to wait until he got to know Trish and not the advice of his friends who urged him to have sex first and talk later. The supporting characters were also pretty spot-on, with the most hilarious moments stolen by his manager, Paula (played by Jane Lynch) when she tries to hint to Andy that they could be friends 'with benefits'. This is a great film but isn't for children (especially the Unrated version). Regardless, for adults, a definite recommendation - a strong 8 out of 10.",8,1,2,9 February 2006
Spider-Man," Nicely done
","Spider-man, in the hands of director Sam Raimi has made this film one of the more spectacular comic book superhero films. Though this isn't as good as the first Superman and Batman movies, it definitely is up there. The pluses are Raimi's direction, the proper casting of Tobey Maguire as the title character and Kirsten Dunst as his love interest Mary Jane Watson. But real kudos goes to James Franco as Harry Osborn (I look forward to his character being developed in the sequels). Also, kudos to Danny Elfman for composing a unique theme for Spider-man (though his Batman theme is better this one is only a shade paler). This is a nicely done film - a 7 out of 10.",7,0,1,27 December 2005
Collateral," Perfect!
","I don't usually give a film the elusive 10 out of 10 score, a score that connotes a perfect film, but in this case I must. During and after seeing 'Collateral' (2004), a film by veteran and master director Michael Mann, I was thoroughly impressed. From the sharp story/screenplay (with its ingenious dialogue) to the acting by Tom Cruise as Vincent and Jamie Foxx as Max, this is one thrilling ride (pardon the pun!). The interplay between them not only works really well, but you actually begin to understand how both Vincent and Max think, even to the point you start to feel sympathetic for both characters. The cinematography is top-notch too, as well as the music. A true gem - a 10 out of 10.As a special note: though I think Tom Cruise in some films gives an okay performance, there are times like in this film where I see his true genius come out - this was a role that was the right fit for him, a GREAT performance!",10,2,3,13 September 2006
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," The best of the 4 so far
","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the best of the 4 films that are out (as of December 2005). The main kudos goes to the director, Alfonso Cuarón (the director of the acclaimed film Y Tu Mamá También). He brought out the adolescent natures of Harry Potter and his friends, starting with their loose clothing (as kids their age would do, whereas in the first 2, the clothes were kempt and proper) and flowing hairstyles (again the kids starting to show their independent natures as opposed to the first two films). The music is also the best of the 4 films, John Williams having outdone himself - this score is the best he has done in quite a long time, putting such varied styles into the film to make it a musical feast. But not only this, unlike the other 3 films which for me are merely adaptations of the beloved books, this one is an actual film which has a proper beginning, middle, and end and not just cut-and-pasted scenes as per book. Therefore, I give this film a well-done 9 out of 10! Highly recommended.",9,0,2,3 December 2005
Batman Begins," Finally a film that gets into Bruce Wayne's psyche
","Even though I consider Tim Burton's original Batman as the classic that no other Batman sequel can beat, Batman Begins finally gets into the psyche of Bruce Wayne, why he became Batman. While the original had much going for it, including a great score by Danny Elfman and superior production design, that film was really about Joker, not Batman. Batman was a one-dimensional character in that film. In this one though, we finally understand who Bruce Wayne is. In fact much of the film is about Bruce Wayne not Batman (he only dons the suit an hour into the film). Although I miss Tim Burton's version, this one really does hold up especially after the dismal Batman and Robin. Highly recommended 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,1 December 2005
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Tired out
","Whereas the first Jurassic Park is an incredible journey into the fascinating world of dinosaurs, this one is merely a retread of the same territory (you definitely feel as if you've been there done that). In fact, there at yet ANOTHER island, fighting the same dinosaurs (some not-so-memorable new ones). And John Williams music, unlike the classic score to the first one, just doesn't have that sense of wonder here. Not only that, the story is quite tame and the acting suffers from flat characters (it's sad because great actors like Jeff Goldblum are subjected to so-so dialogue and events). And the ending is just awful (won't give it away but watch for it). Oh well, at least we have the first one to treasure. 6 out of 10.",6,1,4,3 December 2005
X-Men: The Last Stand," About as good as the first film.
","X-Men: The Last Stand (2006), the third and supposedly final film in the X-Men trilogy, is on par with the first film in terms of enjoyability. And although it cannot stand up to the superb second film, this film by director Brett Ratner (who is new to the franchise) is actually satisfying enough. This is probably because the story didn't do a standard follow-up from the previous film, but decided to veer a sharp right. Watch the film to see what I mean. The visual effects were also top-notch, and perhaps the biggest asset this film has. It's also great to see our favorite characters back again (though I was wondering where Nightcrawler crawled off to). Overall, a satisfying film - a 7 out of 10.One thing to note: I can see why some of the X-Men comic-book buffs hated this film - I won't give away the story but let's say that some pivotal characters have interesting story progressions.",7,0,1,2 June 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Just as great as the first film
","Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, essentially the Act 2 of a 3 Act trilogy structure, successfully continues the classic trilogy. Director Peter Jackson really knows what he's doing, as he expands on the characters we have come to love in the first film (The Fellowship of the Ring) - I was especially impressed with the 'performance' by the CGI-character Gollum (the first CGI character that was realistic enough to me, whose bipolar-ism is explained in detail, making the audience understand how he became how he is and even to the point that you feel sorry for him) - Andy Serkis who portrayed Gollum really deserved at least an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Howard Shore continues a grand trilogy score with an addition of the melodic Rohan theme. A near perfect 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,24 December 2005
The Incredibles," A wonderful homage to James Bond
","This was really the incredibles. A well done CGI animated film from beginning to end. Basically it follows forcefully retired superheroes who must come out of retirement to save the world yet again and in the process learning about each other as a family. The humor and dialogue is spot on throughout the film, the story is very strong, and the CGI animation is top-notch. On top of that, the performances by the stars (most notably Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, and Samuel L. Jackson) are perfect and kudos to composer Michael Giacchino for his homage score to John Barry's James Bond scores. The music was a real treat to those who long for Barry to tackle another James Bond film. All in all, The Incredibles is incredible, a must see at 9 out of 10.",9,0,1,4 December 2005
Ghostbusters," Hilarious
","Ivan Reitman's Ghost Busters is a classic film of the 1980s and still doesn't seem dated (as of December 2005). The script is really strong (very funny dialogue here), which superior production and costume design. However, the main reason this film works is the proper casting of the actors (Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis, Annie Potts, Ernie Hudson, with Bill Murray is the best here as the comic relief character - Doctor Peter Venkman). In essence, this is a great example of an ensemble cast working well together. And kudos goes to Elmer Bernstein for a classic score, and to Ray Parker Jr. for the memorable theme song, 'Ghostbusters'.",8,0,0,30 December 2005
Back to the Future Part III," The best of the III
","This is a great part III and a great movie in general. While I liked the first two episodes, this one really brought a sense of character and family to our time traveling friends, Marty and Doc Brown. And this one was a complete reversal of Back to the Future, where instead of Marty being the center of the film, now it is Doc Brown. This is the case especially when Clara Clayton comes to visit Doc Brown at his house and he and Marty have to cover up the DeLorean, with a model Doc Brown built of how they are going to get back to 1985 near the car - in the first film, it was Marty's mother who visited him and Doc Brown (again both having to cover up the DeLorean and again with a model Doc Brown built to show how Marty will get back to 1985)! But not only this, the chemistry between Mary Steenburgen and Christopher Lloyd was heartfelt and director Robert Zemeckis really brought out the best in both. An excellent movie for sure! Recommended.",10,3,3,2 December 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Informative.
","Nominated for 6 Oscars at the 2006 Oscars including Best Picture of the Year, 'Good Night, and Good Luck.' (2005) is a very informative movie about the fine line that can be crossed against freedom of expression and national security. There is no doubt that this movie was made because of the concerns of increased national security after 9/11 and whether that's crossing the line of censure-ship. Overall, the film relies on black and white cinematography, hearkening back to the B/W days of the 1950s (when this movie takes place). But what really makes this film a wonder is the Oscar-nominated performance by David Strathairn as Edward R. Murrow - without this performance, this movie probably wouldn't hold water. This intriguing movie should be seen if only to get a handle as to what the 1950s McCarthy era was like - an informative 8 out of 10.",8,0,1,12 September 2006
Mission: Impossible II," A worthy sequel.
","'Mission: Impossible II' is another great film directed this time by master director John Woo (you see his touches in this film for sure - including his trademark white doves!). Although this film isn't really in the vein of the 'Mission: Impossible' TV series, probably because most of the main character in the series died in the first film - it's still a great action film. Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt (with long hair this time) as well as Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell. And the action sequences are incredible (as to be expected from John Woo). However, the love interest and villain this time around are okay in my opinion and the score could be better. But otherwise, I think it makes for a worthy sequel - a solid 7 out of 10.",7,2,4,7 May 2006
World Trade Center," Well done film.
","'World Trade Center', the latest film from acclaimed director Oliver Stone is a well made film that realistically shows the horrors that was 9-11.To be honest, I really didn't know what to expect when I heard about this film and purposely avoided finding out exactly the storyline (though of course we all know of 9-11). When I finally saw it, I was humbled by what I saw. And though I saw the 9-11 tragedy on TV in 2001, by seeing this film through the eyes of Nicholas Cage (in another great performance) and Michael Pena, I felt as if I was there to witness the devastation and loss. It brought tears to my eyes by the end of the film.And after the dismal 'Alexander', I was pleased that Oliver Stone was back in top form with this film.A moving 8 out of 10.",8,4,9,10 August 2006
2001: A Space Odyssey," A mixed bag
","This is regarded by some as a classic film for all ages. And in some sense, those critics are right. This film is a spectacle unlike other films of the time - the special effects in this film will inspire countless others like Star Wars 9 years later. Regardless, for me (as for some others), that's all it is, spectacle, a 3 HOUR spectacle that goes on and on. It is SO esoteric that it is probably way above most people's heads. And even though I understand what the filmmaker was going for, it is still too far-fetched for me. On the plus side, Stanley Kubrick makes proper use of classical music (in this case, Richard Strauss) and does have the aforementioned specular special effects. However, if you want to see a stronger focus on story, see its sequel 2010: Odyssey Two.",7,1,3,2 December 2005
The Mummy Returns," Nearly as good as the original
","The Mummy Returns is the kind of movie where you can tell the actors from the first film really enjoyed that adventure to the point that they were willing to sign on immediately for this outing (which is nearly as good as the original film). While Brendan Fraser, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, and Oded Fehr do just as great as they did in the first film, they cannot match a superior performance by Rachel Weisz, whose character has really grown up in the 10 years since the original (she is now strong-willed and action packed, unlike her nervous youthful character in the first film). And while I miss Jerry Goldsmith's score from The Mummy, Alan Silvestri is definitely up for the task and produces just as good of a score. The only unmemorable parts include some cheesy CGI visual effects (look out for the palm trees at the end of the film as they swirl around the pyramid) as well as The Rock (another cheesy CGI construction). 7 out of 10.",7,1,2,24 December 2005
Mission: Impossible," Great movie.
","'Mission: Impossible', a 1996 film directed by Brian De Palma, is a great film. I do know others have found it jarring with a confusing storyline and I have to somewhat agree. However, there are many other elements which make this a very enjoyable film - first and foremost, I love the cinematography - the tilted angles which shows how chaotic the situation that Ethan Hunt (played by Tom Cruise) is put in. Jim Phelps (played by Jon Voight) expertly plays his mentor in an interesting role. Ving Rhames stars as Luther Stickell (the only other character besides Ethan Hunt who is in all 3 films so far). Emmanuelle Beart as Claire Phelps also makes an appealing love interest. The action sequences are top-notch (especially the helicopter sequence at the end!) and the music is very fitting (by master composer Danny Elfman). I would recommend this film - a high 8 out of 10.",8,8,9,7 May 2006
Total Recall," A classic!
","In what is probably Paul Verhoeven's best film to date, Total Recall takes Phillip K. Dick's short story We Can Remember It For You Wholesale and makes it into a slam-bang action film that never falters for even a moment. While I don't consider Arnold Schwarzenegger the best of actors, he does a very good job under Verhoeven's direction as Douglas Quaid/Hauser. Kudos also to Rachel Ticotin as Melina and Sharon Stone as the overly sexy Lori (this film really made her film career which she would follow up with Verhoeven in the superb Basic Instinct only two years later). However, the best part of this classic is Jerry Goldsmith's best score of his career. He successfully and interestingly combines classic orchestral techniques with synth elements. Well done Jerry (RIP). This is a very solid 9 out of 10 and a must see.",9,0,2,5 December 2005
Inside Man," Great film
","Inside Man (2006), the newest film by directing genius Spike Lee, is another great film, one that makes you look at what is right and wrong and who is good and evil. This film has an all star cast including Denzel Washington in another slam-bang performance as Detective Keith Frazier, a detective given a second chance to prove himself, as well as a brilliant performance by Jodie Foster as Madeline White. This cast also stars Clive Owen as the purported bank robber, Christopher Plummer as the bank owner with a hidden past, and Willem Dafoe as Captain John Darius. What really did it for me though, was that the script was very strong and the right actors were cast to say and act the parts, along with BRILLIANT cinematography by Matthew Libatique (who also shot Phone Booth). A true gem of a film - 8 out of 10.",8,2,3,7 April 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Could have been much better.
","After reading the book 'The Da Vinci Code', which author Dan Brown made into a fantastic suspense thriller, I expected the same thing from the likes of master director Ron Howard. Alas, I was disappointed. Not that this is a bad movie, but unlike the book, this version seems disjointed, and not that Tom Hanks or the other actors did a bad job, but they've seen better days. It seemed to me that the script was rushed, which isn't surprising considering they had to condense a long book down into 2 hours - but because of that, the movie suffers, with more explanations necessary. That said, one interesting method Howard employed was to see Langdon's as he 'sees' (aka highlights) the numbers and letters (a method Howard used with Russell Crowe's character in 'A Beautiful Mind'). However, another method Howard employed, that of flashback, was too in your face, as if the audience needed to see what was being explained. Oh well, a 7 out of 10.",7,0,3,23 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Nicely done.
","This is a great adaptation of the first Harry Potter novel, with a properly paced story that takes you along for a magic joy ride. I'm especially pleased with the score by John Williams, who again creates a memorable main theme (the last memorable one being 1993's Jurassic Park) and keeps the story moving along. The kids that play the main characters are properly cast, along with the adults (especially Alan Rickman as Severus Snape and especially Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore - he is sorely missed after Chamber of Secrets, RIP). Unlike the successive films, this has the simplest of stories and is therefore the easiest to follow. And because it is the first film, we, along with Harry Potter as our guide, are happily discovering the new world of magic and witchcraft. A solid of 8 out 10!",8,0,1,3 December 2005
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Not as good as Azkaban
","Although this is a good film, it unfortunately hearkens back to the adaptation technique from the novels of the first two films rather than trying to be a film. Whereas Azkaban really had a beginning, middle, and end, and thus kept the pacing going, this film doesn't and for that reason it seems to be many scenes strung together just to keep the plot going. This makes for a slower pacing and makes the 2 1/2 hours seem like MUCH longer. The problem really is, since this is movie number 4, it has to rely on the previous 3 films and that makes the plot more complicated (thus having to tell more in the same amount of the approximate 2 1/2 hours for each film). In fact, they had to cut a LOT out to even make it possible to keep it at 2 1/2 hours and regardless it still seemed too long! Hopefully, with Order of the Phoenix, which is a long book like this Goblet of Fire but has a shorter plot overall, they can avoid this problem. And as a side note, although Patrick Doyle did try his best with this score, he isn't John Williams and I hope Williams does find time to score the last 3 films in the Harry Potter series. 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,3 December 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," The Matrix Continued!
","Andy and Larry Wachowski's The Matrix Reloaded continues 6 months after the first one ended. Although this Matrix film isn't as innovative as the original, it does try (mostly successfully) to top the original with slam-bang visual effects. In fact, there really isn't a story - but this isn't too surprising when considering it is the middle chapter of a trilogy (and more so, a part 1 of a 2 part film - The Matrix Reloaded and the upcoming Revolutions). While there isn't much character development of the main characters (Neo, Trinity, Morpheus), at the same time the visual effects are mostly superb (except for a video game-ish fight between Neo and 100 Smiths) and an outstanding score by Don Davis and Juno Reactor (Don Davis really is given room to breathe whereas in the first one his score was mostly 'under' score). A must-see 8 out of 10.",8,0,1,27 December 2005
A Beautiful Mind," A Beautiful Film
","This is a really wonderful film, I applaud Ron Howard, Brian Grazer, James Horner and of course, Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly for masterly bringing the subject of John Nash to life. Ron Howard has done some really great films before (including Willow and Apollo 13) but this is probably his best. With Russell Crowe, he was able to convey how John Nash thought when he looked at numbers (you saw numbers flash to life here and there as the camera moved around John Nash), while the beautiful piano ballad and Charlotte Church's voice accentuated the musical atmosphere created by James Horner. Though the film does go on a bit too long, the other aspects of it truly make up for it. Hope you have the chance to see this beautiful film.",9,0,2,2 December 2005
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," More of the same but still fun.
","For me, this film, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is merely a continuation of the first Harry Potter. But that necessarily isn't a bad thing because I very much liked the first one and the same director Chris Columbus is back for this outing. Like the first one, we have a Quidditch match again, the kids looks exactly the same, and it is again a true adaptation of the novel with another intriguing detective story (finding out who the Heir of Slytherin is). And again, John Williams (with William Ross' help) gives us a clone of his Sorcerer's Stone score (which again isn't a bad thing though I will have to wait until Azkaban for a truly incredible Potter score from Williams). All in all, a 7 out of 10.",7,0,1,3 December 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Pitt and Jolie = The Right Click
","This is the type of film where it really is about the costars - in this case, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie who are the perfect screen couple in a very long time. If it wasn't for their chemistry, there would be nothing memorable about this movie. A movie which has no story to speak of, not very memorable dialogue and has-been-done-before special effects. Regardless, the Pitt-Jolie connection is SO strong and quite hilarious that this is the type of movie you will want to see over and over again. For that reason, I give Mr. and Mrs. Smith a solid 8 out of 10 (with any other actors in these main roles, I would give the film around a 4 out of 10). Kudos to Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie for great performances!",8,1,3,2 December 2005
Wedding Crashers," Laugh out funny!
","This film is one of those comedies where it only works because of the character interaction of the main characters - in this case, Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn (with my hat tipped more to Vince Vaughn for his excellent performance). The story itself is quite ordinary but the dialogue (whether the above mentioned actors ad libbed or used the dialogue as written on the script page) was very funny and really worked in the mouths of Mr. Wilson and Mr. Vaughn. What happens to Vince Vaughn though is stuff movies are made of - he gets the brunt of the slapstick humor (i.e. getting chased by a neurotic 20 year old girl and a gay teenager). A laugh out riot of a movie, a must see!",8,1,1,2 December 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Recaptures the spirit of the Original Trilogy
","Finally, George Lucas has made a prequel film worthy of the name Star Wars. The film has the qualities that made the original trilogy what it is - great music (John Williams really outdid himself overall with the score - the Anakin vs. Obi Wan battle music is made all the more personal and fitting because of his music), great story (this is the episode we wanted to see, not the fillers that were Episodes I and II), great performances for the most part (especially of Ian McDiarmid in a FINALLY outgoing performance as Palpatine - we waited 5 films for this 'unveiling').The only real complaints I have are: the continuing over-reliance on CGI and horrible dialog's during the Anakin and Padme scenes.Thus, overall, 8 out of 10. Well done, Mr. Lucas!",8,1,7,30 November 2005
Ray," A performance that makes a film.
","'Ray' (2004) is a spectacular biopic film mainly because of the outstanding Oscar-winning performance by Jamie Foxx as the lead character Ray Charles. The film takes place during the late 1940s to the 1960s, following Ray Charles' rise to fame and the price that comes with it including heroin addiction that leads to bouts with the police, and numerous affairs with other women besides his wife. Not only that, there are flashbacks to his childhood in the 1930s and how his mother influenced what he was to become. Also kudos in acting go to Kerry Washington as his wife Bea and Regina King as his mistress Margie Hendricks. This is a must-see film for the acting - an 8 out of 10.",8,1,2,12 September 2006
The Terminal," Not Spielberg's best
","Well, it doesn't happen often but it was bound to happen again - a so-so Spielberg film. The Terminal seems to be Steven Spielberg on auto-pilot, with an inexcusable amount of product placement which would make any movie-goer want to leave in the middle of the film (an example of this occurs when Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones are in a 2-shot talking to each other, with a Starbucks RIGHT in the middle of the shot - of course, you would realize that a Starbucks in right there). Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones also give so-so performances, as if they realize the script is just an average one. Oh well. The only real plus I can think of is the superb score by John Williams - he for sure wasn't on auto-pilot! An okay 6 out of 10.",6,0,4,24 December 2005
Back to the Future Part II," A fitting middle episode
","Back to the Future II isn't as good as the other two, but it is a necessary middle act that bridges Parts I and III. The best part, the part that I grew up with is the 2015 sequence, when Marty uses the hover board. And it was really fun when there were two Marty's and two Doc Brown's in 1955 and how they happen to run into each other. Alan Silvestri's music for this film is pretty much what it was from the first film (a fitting continuation of the first film if not inspired - wait until Part III for Silvestri's best score of the trilogy!) I really again enjoyed the performances of Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, their on-screen interactions are stuff legends are made of. Even though I consider Part II the weakest in this trilogy, it's still a worthy entry, worth an 8 out of 10. Enjoy!",8,1,2,30 November 2005
X2: X-Men United," Great sequel
","This was a better sequel than the first film (which was also quite good) and kudos goes to director Bryan Singer for doing so. Again, the actors pulled in the right punches, with Patrick Stewart (as Professor Charles Xavier) and Hugh Jackman (as Logan/Wolverine) again in the spotlight. Not only that, the story is stronger than the first film and John Ottman gives the film a strong score than the late Michael Kamen (an equally adept composer for most other films = just look at his Die Hard scores but unfortunately not the first X-Men score). Not only that, the production design, cinematography, and visual effects are all top-notch and not over-the-top, servicing the story (NOT being the story). This film is a must see, a strong 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,6 December 2005
Amélie," Stellar film
","Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain, Le, better known in the USA as Amelie, is a stellar film by French filmmaker Jean-Pierre Jeunet. The story and dialogue itself is very smart, but what really did it for me was the usage of color and composition. This is truly a great lesson in cinematography. The main colors in the film are green, red, yellow, B/W (not technically a color but a lack of), and blue. While green and red are used most (which I think signifies Amelie's moods and her view of her world), yellow is also used frequently (signifying neutrality), with blue only used sporadically (it signifies an important event or object - i.e. Nino's bag). The shot choices which brings these colors to life are also top-notch - you can freeze frame each frame of the movie and it will ALL be fascinating just to stare at. Truly a visual masterpiece - highly recommended, 9 out of 10.",9,0,2,26 March 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The best in the trilogy and perhaps one of the best films of all time.
","The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King tops the first two films that came before it (The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers) - which is no easy feat considering the first two were near perfect films in their own right! Director Peter Jackson really has a passion and understanding for film-making and the beloved The Lord of the Rings books by J.R.R. Tolkien. Considering this film is the longest of the three, it would have been easy for any other filmmaker to make this film long and boring - only Peter Jackson could have successfully continually make it exciting (with only the very end of the film dragging on just a little bit). Again, an special mention goes to the cast (kudos to Sean Astin as Sam) and composer Howard Shore (whose theme for Gondor is one of the most majestic themes ever composed). A PERFECT 10 out of 10 (the first 10 out of 10 movie on the IMDb that I reviewed BTW!).",10,2,4,24 December 2005
Munich," Not bad
","Munich, the newest film by director Steven Spielberg is an okay film, not one of his best by any means but not one of his worst either. My real complaint was that it was VERY long (at 164 minutes - and it FEELS like 164+ minutes). Because of it's enormous length, the pacing for me was really really slow and made me look at my watch a number of times during the screening. And though Eric Bana and the supporting cast did a wonderful job in their roles, they are given an okay script (with a few touching moments I do admit) to work with - but also I felt very detached from the characters (I can't really explain why but whereas in other Spielberg's films I was able to feel the emotional pull of a certain character, this wasn't one of those films). Well, regardless, it is a Spielberg film and you should watch it if only for that reason - a 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,28 January 2006
The Matrix," 'The One' that started it all
","Andy and Larry Wachowski's The Matrix is a great film that caused a new cinematic stir like Star Wars did 22 years before this film. It was innovative and creative to say the least - especially with its use of 'bullet time' which was a cinematic style that was never attempted before. And the story is very interesting - it involves an apocalyptic future where most people are 'jacked in' to the Matrix, a 'real' world virtual reality representation of the late 20th century. There are those who realize it isn't real and would stop at nothing to destroy the Matrix from the machines that have enslaved most of the human populace - and they would accomplish this in a belief that Neo, The One, will bring about this revolution. A great film that should be cherished - a superb 9 out of 10.",9,0,1,27 December 2005
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Epic!
","This is the stuff that makes for classic film-making! The film has it all - a great and simple story (which is really the Hero's Journey in play - Luke Skywalker our hero escapes his desolate existence to fight evil and rescue the Princess), properly paced editing (this film did a 180 from the classical style of editing where the pacing was slower and the editing less), a wonderful score by John Williams (who already outdone himself with Jaws in 1975), wholly original production design (lightsabers, the Death Star, X Wings, and of course Darth Vader!), and a sense of danger wherever our likable heroes turn. The best scene of this film is when Luke Skywalker looks at the twin suns of Tatooine longing for more than his dismal existence as a farmer. Don't we all feel that way some time? Don't we all long to do something extraordinary, to get that happy ending. I sure did and this filmed delivered - for this reason, I give this film a solid 9 out of 10.",9,0,1,3 December 2005
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Simply the best!
","For me, Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back is the best film ever made. It has everything to offer, intriguing story and dialogue (i.e. Leia finally admits her love for Han Solo saying 'I love you!' and Han Solo replies simply 'I know' - a classic dialogue interaction, as well as the classic line, 'No Luke, I am your Father'), superb music (by my favorite composer John Williams - the Imperial March is unforgettable, even more so than the original Star Wars Main Theme composition), proper pacing as the story paces along (this can be attributed to a number of factors but I think the editing really takes the kudos), the best acting in the series (Star Wars isn't known for its superb acting but in this case, I really did enjoy the character interactions between Han and Leia, and I even bought the puppet performance of Yoda - in some sense, just as good as the CGI Gollum in Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers). This is the must see Star Wars film and in general, the best film of all time!",10,0,1,2 December 2005
Aladdin," Hilarious!
","Although not as good as its animated predecessor Beauty and the Beast, this is a really well done and extremely funny film. It follows the story of Aladdin, a street urchin, who finds the Genie in the Bottle who grants him three wishes, which has to do with meeting the Royal Princess Jasmine. What really makes it great is the laugh-out funny performance of Robin Williams as the Genie. He continually pulls all the punches and makes the strong script and dialogue even more so funny. On top of that, there are the great songs and score by Alan Menken (who also did the wonderful score and songs for Beauty and the Beast) and top-notch animation that makes this Disney outing worthwhile to watch on any day of the week. A strong 8 out of 10.",8,1,1,4 December 2005
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The 2nd best of the classic Indiana Jones trilogy
","Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is the second best in the classic Indiana Jones trilogy. Again, master director Steven Spielberg and master storyteller George Lucas decide to focus on the Nazis (as they did in the first but not second film). This adventure is probably the most widely traveled of the Indiana Jones films, traveling to nearly every continent in the span of 127 minutes. Harrison Ford again eases himself into the title role of Indiana Jones, with Sean Connery a superb addition as his father Henry. Denholm Elliot and John Rhys-Davies make a welcome return from the first film as Marcus Brody and Sallah, with Alison Doody a fine heroine addition as Elsa Schneider. Also, maestro John Williams manages to outdo himself with the Indiana Jones scores with the BEST score of his career - if you are a film music fan, then I recommend getting this score for sure. Oh, and like the first two films with the 'snake' and 'bugs' scenes, this time around, look out for 'rats!' A solid 8 out of 10.",8,1,1,24 January 2006
Back to the Future," Ready set go!
","This is the classic film that started a trilogy to remember for all ages. Whoever thought of using a DeLorean as a time machine is a genius! The film really is nostalgia times ten, first for those in 1985 seeing what is was like in 1955, but now in 2005 seeing what 1985 was like! There are the homages to Michael Jackson, the skateboard riding, funky clothes, and pop music. Robert Zemeckis brings out the best in the costars, Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, both who are incredible in their roles. Not only that, the pacing is great, the screenplay is top-notch, and Alan Silvestri's score is classic. Anyone who hears the main Back to the Future theme will know it right away I guarantee you that! A very solid 9 out of 10.",9,1,2,2 December 2005
Jurassic Park," The film that got me hooked
","While The Empire Strikes Back is the best film of all time for me, Jurassic Park is the film that got me into my current film-making career. More specifically, it was a combination of factors in one key scene - the helicopter sequence as the characters approach the island. The acting interaction in this scene between Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Richard Attenborough was very heartfelt (attributed to their acting skills and director Steven Spielberg), the cinematography was spectacular, and last but not least, the music of John Williams. I must make a special note here, John Williams' score for this film is legendary, having really gotten me first hooked to film music and then films in general in the first place. I really do look forward to each successive score that maestro Williams does (I just bought Memoirs of a Geisha - another great score). Although the story is a bit weak, otherwise Jurassic Park is above and beyond a typical action film. Well done Spielberg and Williams!",9,2,3,2 December 2005
V for Vendetta," A superb film
","V For Vendetta continues the Wachowski Brothers' superb style of film-making. Following in the styles of The Matrix Trilogy and Bound, in terms of the look and issues, this film works on all levels. Especial kudos go to Hugo Weaving for his brilliant performance as V - only an actor of his caliber can take the Wachowski Brothers' intricate usage of dialogue and make it work. He keeps his mask on for the whole film and yet I felt the emotions he tried to convey WITHOUT facial usage - Mr. Weaving is indeed a great actor. Natalie Portman also does a stellar job as Evey, and the director James McTeigue successfully brings the Wachowski's script to life. Oh, and look out for the brilliant fight sequence finale - well done indeed - a V for Victory! This is no much a review as an endorsement for the film which I don't really want to give away the plot - suffice it to say, see the film, you won't regret it - 9 out of 10.",9,2,4,26 March 2006
