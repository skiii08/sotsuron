Blade Runner 2049," One of the worst movies I've ever seen. The movie is so slow, so boring as the plot is so plain.
","I really had a high hope for this one because it had high rating here on IMDB. So, I watched it. The running time is nearly 3 hours long, so, I patiently watched. As an hour passed, nothing much happened. At that time, I thought the movie was 3 hours long, so, they needed some time to build the plot. And so, I waited for great scenes. But instead of great scenes, what came from the movie was disappointment. The movie is so slow, so boring and the plot is so plain. The plot has nothing. The K character was moving and tracking for something from place to place. And he found a man as a result. That is all for the plot. I'll tell you how much the movie is boring. Normally, I always finish a movie in one sit. I always finish a movie in one day. I could watch it even when I was about to go to sleep. I remembered when I watched Justice League, I was about to go to sleep. My eyes were almost closing. But the movie kept me awake. I finished it without feeling sleepy. But this movie? Well, it took me 3 days to finish. Because it's so boring, after every an hour passed, I didn't want to continue to watch. So, I stopped watching it. A day passed, on the next day, I thought if I haven't finished it, I wouldn't know about the movie. So, I continued to watch. The same thing happened. I got bored again after an hour passed. So, I stopped watching again. In this way, it took me 3 days to finish. This movie might be great one for some people, but for me, it's not even worth to spend 3 hours of free time.Thank Buddha that I didn't go to cinema and watch this crap. If I did, my aunt would probably scold me for wasting money to watch this crap. And I'd probably wanted to get out in the middle of the movie and wanted to get a refund. I saw that some people watched this one for more than once and some people watched it many times. I don't know what made them like this movie. But for me, it's one time watch only. I would never ever watch this crap. I only watched this one because of high ratings and nominations for Oscars. Although the movie is so slow, so plain and so boring, the sound mixing is quite good. Sound editing and visual effects are not that much good and also cinematography too. I hope the other nominees would win for sound editing, visual effects and cinematography. All in all, if you don't have anything to watch to make you feel sleepy, then watch this one. It will definitely make you feel sleepy because it worked for me.",1,10,18,21 February 2018
A Star Is Born," Didn't end very well. Surely should have done better job!
","A few months back, A Star is Born film was trending everywhere I saw. And when I checked out here, the rating was high. That's why I watched this film.This is the first Lady Gaga film I've ever watched. I only watched Selena Gomez in films in the terms of singers who moved to the films. Some are great, and some aren't. Not all people can act in front of the camera just because they had courses attended, you know? It's sort of talent to make it looks natural.The story itself is good in some way, but it's still boring. For most of the films, except Blade Runner 2049, I could finish them in one sit. And whenever I have something to do in the middle of the film, I don't want to stop watching because the film got control over me. Even if I must do that something and stop watching, I always continue to watch. That is the only thing I want to do the most. So, no matter how busy I am, I always remember to continue watching. But this movie? Well, it didn't get my attention that much. When I was watching this film, of course I had to stop watching for a while and had to do something in the middle of the film. By the time I finish doing my work, I didn't even remember to continue watching this film. After some time passed, I recalled that I haven't finished the film yet. So, I continued. On three times, I could finish the film. I even said, finally!I like Lady Gaga for her songs and I'm a fan. But as an actress, I'm so sorry to say that I'm not. Her acting is terrible. (In fact, almost all actresses are bad at acting in this film.) I totally dislike her acting.The presentation of the film is normal. It needs something. Some scenes are touchable and some are terribly boring that I want to stop watching the film.The story needs to improve more. And I don't like the ending. It should continue, so, this is the one which doesn't end with proper ending. It should have continued. Therefore, it's sort of annoying.One more thing I'd like to say is that so much use of F word. I get that we're all adults and most get used to it. But exclusively use of that word is kind of making me feel uncomfortable.Overall, the story is quite simple. Because of the director's presentation, it's sort of boring. If you want to watch it, I wouldn't stop you. At least, it's worth to watch it once.",2,9,17,14 December 2018
Mulan," One of the best animations of all time. A must watch.
","Mulan is one of the films I watched when I was a little girl and also it is one of those films I love to this day. I don't know whether Mulan is just a legend or she really existed in the real world, but she is kind of a hero to me. I love her story of taking his father's place and went to war. It's so touching.I only know the Chinese version. So, I don't know her name really is Hua Mulan, or the surname is something and Mulan, but if it is, I'd say Disney got it wrong. I really don't like the surname Fa. Whenever I hear that surname Fa, it makes me annoyed. So, I prefer Hua.What makes me love Mulan is of course the story. And also it's amazing original score, especially, the tune of that scene where Mulan prepares herself to go to war and takes horse and leaves home. That scene is also one of my favourites.I think the original story doesn't have anything about dragon which is Mushu in this film. Disney put that part by themselves. But that part is also good too. Wherever Mushu appears, I find it quite funny. That's why I love Mushu.All in all, Mulan is an amazing animation which will never get old. Even it is, it's like old but gold. Hence, Mulan is one of those animations that everyone must watch at least once in their lives.",10,0,0,10 May 2019
Train to Busan," Great zombie film even though it's Korea's the first zombie film ever.
","Train to Busan is Korea's the first zombie film and also one of the best zombie films of all time. I rarely watch Korean films, but when I saw this film, I was totally surprised because it's the first.As the film name, Train to Busan, the whole thing happened on the train. So, the filming location scope is small but it turned out great. What I like of this film is it shows if you don't want to die, you'll die quicker than usual. So, we don't need to afraid of dying. We all have to die one day anyway. No one can avoid it.I really hate that CEO guy. The way he try to survive by pushing all people around him to die is something I hate most. And also I hate Koreans always love to kill off the main character(s), making the film unhappy ending. If they make the film end with some kind of happy ending, it'd be better than this.The makeup skills, special effects used in this film and performances of actors and actresses are good, so that the film becomes better and better. Even though this film is the first zombie film that Koreans ever made, it's like they had a lot of experiences with zombie films. They could make a great one on the first go.Although there are some things that I don't like in this film, it still makes one of the best zombie films I've ever watched. It's enjoyable, so, I recommend you all to watch it.",10,1,2,18 May 2019
The Maze Runner," An awesome film with a flaw.
","The Maze Runner is one of my favourites film series of all time. Although I haven't read the novel yet, but I love the film version very much. In the film, there are some things that they have changed and a bit different from the novel, still, the film makes sense (except for one thing) and I still love it.One thing I don't understand to this day is that when they (Thomas, Newt, Minho and the others) finished the trial, then they found the room and play Ava's message. After that they found Gally. So, my question is how did Gally make it out? I mean he doesn't have a key and the path they used, it already is sealed. And when they passed, there was no sign of Gally. So, Gally's appearance in this room is literally impossible. (Unless Gally is a spy from WICKED to stop the others from getting out of course.) And they didn't explain it. I don't know about the novel. I don't know how it went in the novel. Maybe it might be different. I think I have to read the novel to know about it.Overall is that except for that fact described in above, the film is quite good and enjoyable.",10,0,0,13 May 2019
Captain Marvel," It's not that bad and it's not that good either. Just somewhere in between.
","Before I watched this film, I've heard that Captain Marvel got a lot of disagreements and arguments. Mainly because of what Marvel did. Before they created this Captain Marvel character, the most powerful superhero was what the fans say it was someone else. I don't know who that is exactly, so, I don't know the exact name. But what I remembered that they were saying that it wasn't Captain Marvel. That's for sure. So, after they created this CM character, she became the most powerful superhero of MCU. And that's what made fans angry. Hence, this film gets a lot of down votes and negative reviews everywhere.I watch films which turned from comics. But I don't read comics. So, I don't know about who is the most powerful superhero before they created Captain Marvel and also about all superheroes Marvel ever created and etc. Thus, it's hard for me to give comments on this. But I can still give my opinion on the film. It might not be what you think and might get a lot of disagreement, but I'm going to say it anyway.As I've said in the title section, this film is not that bad as some people are saying. It's kind of enjoyable. But I must admit that the story is too simple like nothing is there. I like the special effects. Those special effects are amazing. I give you that. So, if they could improve the main plot, well, I bet it would turn out to be better than this.There are a lot of things I don't like of this film. But I don't want to write all of those facts. So, I'll just write two main facts only. One is this. Captain Marvel is somewhere from another universe and gets to a planet called C-53. I mean it's not earth. If it is, they will give the planet's name 'The Earth' straightforward. But they didn't, so, I take it it's not Earth. In a lot of films, alien planets really look like Earth even though it's name isn't called Earth. I mean we are human and we all live on the Earth. So, when creating a film, all of the film location are on this world. It will be the same place because it's filmed on this Earth. But for those planets which are not named Earth, they should have created the environment NOT to look like the Earth. I mean if it looks like the Earth, why isn't the planet named 'the Earth'?The other thing is that I know Brie Larson is a great actress. But seeing her as a superhero is kind of weird even though her acting is good. It's not that I'm againsting her. It's just, I've felt that fact that she's a superhero is kind of weird.All in all, there were a lot of noisy voices about Captain Marvel when it was in theatre, but after I watched it, I felt it wasn't that bad. I don't know about others, it's kind of enjoyable. At least, we get to see Jade Law's some dark side performance. So, I'd say it's kind of worth it.",3,0,4,1 June 2019
World War Z," One of the films that I love.
","Word War Z is one of the best Zombie films I've ever seen. Zombies in the film are quite different. Most of Zombies I've seen are like people can't outrun them. No matter how hard people try, they just can't hide from them. But in this film, it's quite different.I know that most people think that if they do things in the old-fashioned way, the audiences might feel bored and so, it might lead to less viewers. Thus, some people try and change the plot in order to make it different from the others. Those kinds of changes are sometimes good and sometimes, they don't make any sense anymore. Everything has good and bad.As I've said in above, this film is quite different from the other Zombie films I've seen. The difference is that people can hide from those Zombie using a way. This is what the lead character found. And I think this is the only thing that doesn't make any sense in this film.Using the method of infecting yourself with some kind of undeadly viruses isn't the way. You can't infect yourself forever. One way or the other, you will be exposed to them. I don't know why the writer used that kind of way. It shouldn't be.Except that fact, everything looks great. I love Brad Pitt's awesome performance and all. What I like the most is they sneak in to the section where there are full of Zombies to get the viruses. All in all, this film is very good and I enjoyed fully. It's totally worth spending time.",8,1,2,5 May 2019
Passengers," Surprisingly great!
","The movie is surprisingly great. When I saw this first time, it didn't attract me because it seems like a drama. But I tried to watch it anyway. And then I amazed. The first thing came was the love story of Jim and Aurora. I'm kind of sick of love stories. But this one isn't boring and even it's interesting. The more I watched, the more I found out it's really a great film. So, I keep watching. Then the final part came and made me cried. Aurora's love on Jim is so strong and I even wished I would have that kind of boyfriend. When the movie's ended, it made me wonder one question. Those two didn't have kid(s)? :D",9,0,3,8 February 2018
Star Trek Into Darkness," The Best of Star Trek series.
","When I first saw Star Trek Into Darkness, it was on a local TV channel. It was in the morning just I was woke up. I heard TV was on and I asked my aunt that what programme it was on. She said it's a film named 'Star Trek Into Darkness'. When I heard the film name, I've immediately got out from the bed and sat in front of the TV right away and watched it because at that time, I planned to watch it, but never had a chance. That's why I was so eager to see it. Unfortunately, at that time, the film was nearly ended, so, I could only watch the final scene. Lucky for me is that they aired it again at night. So, I watched it. Later, because I love it very much, I tried to get it and yeah, I still have it in my PC. To this day, I still watch it again and again.Star Trek Into Darkness is one of those films that Benedict Cumberbatch was in it as a villain. I mean it's rare to see Benedict Cumberbatch as a bad guy. But it's awesome. I feel like whichever film he's in, that film turned out to be a great one. That's the main reason why I watched Star Trek Into Darkness.The film is so great. The special effects are so cool. And Benedict Cumberbatch's acting is so good. I totally love him. The others' performances are good too. Because of those awesome performances, the film turned out to be a great one.The sound editing, the sound effects and the others are also great too. I feel like everything's perfect in this film. All in all, I don't know what other people think of this film, as for me, it is indeed one of my favourite films.",10,1,4,10 May 2019
Beauty and the Beast," One of the best animations of Disney.
","Beauty and the Beast is one of the best animations from Disney. I love it very much. The story is about the love of ordinary girl and a beast. The beast is actually a prince or not, he is a beast when the story began, so, it's very rare that a beautiful girl falls in love with ugly beast. That is the fact that makes me love this story.As for kids, it might not be some kind of animation which most of the children would love, but for adults, it's kind of lovely story and very enjoyable. No need to say anymore words, the animation is very good. So, I recommend you all to watch it at least one time.",10,1,1,18 May 2019
Aquaman," One of the most boring films I've ever seen.
","Totally boring. I started watching it two months ago and for some reason I was busy for a while, so, I stopped watching it. To this day, I don't even want to watch and also, I don't remember to continue to watch it.",1,3,5,24 March 2019
Deadpool 2," Some type of bad film which has high rating.
","I don't know how this film gets 8.0 high rating here on IMDB. And I don't know why I chose this one to watch. When the film's finished, I regret my decision. I shouldn't have watched. I've wasted 2 hrs time for nothing. I want that time back.The film is terrible to watch. They stretched the film to make it longer. And the language they used is really bad as in the previous one. The fact that I hate the most is that Deadpool Wade guy is really into some kind of homosexual gene. In the nearly end scene where he hugged that Cable guy. He looked like he wanted to hug him so badly. It's totally unwatchable for me. I really hate that scene.All in all, the film is really bad. But I gave 2 stars anyway. One is for some efforts made by the crew and the other one is for that stunt who died during filming. Otherwise, it doesn't even deserve a star from me.",2,11,25,27 July 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," It's great except for one little thing.
","After I watched this film, I just have a question. Is it necessary to have Thor blind in one eye?Yeah, that is the sad part that Thor is now blind in one eye. I feel like it's kind of unnecessary to let him. And no offence but one eyed Thor is ugly. I don't like it.Except for this fact, this film is really great and I've totally enjoyed it.",9,2,9,24 June 2019
Ready Player One," Life in a game. That's new.
","Have you wondered how it's gonna be like in the game? What are you look like? And how would you behave? I wondered. For those people who didn't wonder, well, Ready Player One shows exactly this fact.The story is just like others, the characters are running along, they solve things and all. But it still makes me interested because it's not in the real world, but in the game. Although the game characters are really ugly, but it's still watchable.This film reminded me of pokemon game that was so popular around the world a few years ago. We people are looking at the phone and can't give attention to the surroundings. In this film, people are also like this. They are wearing it and walking around. They can't give any attention to the surroundings. If this is the future predictions, well, we are doomed. But luckily, for now, it's only a film.All in all, Ready Player One is something different, but it's so enjoyable. It gives you some different tastes, so, it's kind of a good film.",9,0,2,27 May 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," My Opinion, it's Iron Man : Homecoming rather than Spiderman : Homecoming.
","I'm a big fan of Spiderman. I always love it. Whenever I heard a new film is coming out, I always watch it immediately. And like almost every Spiderman film is great. They never make the viewers disappointed.Spiderman : Homecoming film is very different from other Spiderman because I feel like Spiderman in this film isn't quite good compared to the ones in other films. Or maybe the Iron Man is really showing off in this film.No offence, but as for me, it's about Spiderman's victories and he should be a hero in this film. Instead, I feel like Iron Man is hero. So, the film name shouldn't be Spiderman : Homecoming. It should be Iron Man : Homecoming. I really hate that they made Spiderman got scolded. Of course, there was some parts at later time where he's a hero, but every scenes need to show he's a hero, and not Iron Man because this is about Spiderman, and not Iron Man.To be honest, when I think of that fact, I couldn't even enjoy the film completely. But I must admit it's a great film if I didn't think about that fact. All in all, I will be waiting to see more of Spiderman being a hero and do the right things as he always does.(P.S: My opinion ONLY.)",6,1,7,25 June 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," The film which left the audiences hanging as the story isn't a complete one.
","I only watched this movie because it went to Oscars nomination list and also Golden Globes. I didn't have a high hopes for it because I knew that it will turn out to be a drama and yes, it did. It really turned into a drama.1) The story. The plot of this film is about a woman who lost her daughter. Her daughter was raped by some guy or some gang and died because of it. But the local police didn't find the person or gang who is responsible for that. So, she wrote this story on three billboards outside their town, Ebbing, Missouri just like the movie title said. The rest of the film focuses on the consequences of her actions. There's nothing much in the plot and because of it turned out to be a drama and I'm not a fan of dramas, so, it's kind of boring. But at least, it's watchable because of the following facts, performances of actors and directing.2) Performances of the actors and actresses. Their performances are so good, especially the supporting actor, Sam Rockwell as Dixon. When I saw Oscars winners list, I wonder why he got the award. But when I saw his performance in the film, no wonder he got the award. He's such a great actor. I really hated the Dixon character. He's such a jerk.3) Directing. As I've stated in above, this film is drama and I'm so bored when I watch drama. But I think because of the director, I could watch it without feeling boring. For the whole movie to be great, not only screenplay writer needs to be good, but also the director needs to be great too. Only the director can make the movie great, especially when directing dramas. This film turned out to be not that much boring, because of the director's skill, I guess.4) Sound editing, sound mixing and editing are at normal. No comment on them.5) Original Score. The original score used in the film is quite normal. But in the film, it quite fits. But it's not that much good. I guess that's why it didn't get an award.6) Photography/Cinematography. The story is based on the small town, so, there are no so many beautiful scenes. But photography is great. They could make is beautiful to those scenes even the scenes are not that much beautiful. I was amazed when I saw those scenes. So, I'd say it's quite good.7) OK, here comes likes and dislikes. What I like in this film is if you've done something bad to other people, you will get the same result someday. That's the nature of karma. They could show it in the film clearly. On the other hand, I don't like the end. I feel like the story didn't end that way. They should have stated who raped her daughter. They only stated the guy that Dixon thought he could be the guy, but he wasn't the one. Dixon sure that he is the guy. And then they stated that guy isn't even in the country when that happened. And, they stated Dixon is right that he has done something like that in the other county, but not here. Then, they stated it's classified. Why is it classified? I don't think it's classified because he's commanding officer. Then Dixon and Mildred went to that guy to kill him. So, here's my question. Did they kill that guy? They should have stated those two facts, who raped her daughter and did they kill that guy? But they didn't. They left the audiences hanging. So, I feel like the story didn't end. There should be much more. All in all, I really hate those films which left the audience to have several ideas and hanging. So, I'm not that much into this film, but it's watchable and enjoyable, but for only one watch.
(P.S: My opinion ONLY.)",3,1,4,27 March 2018
Hugo," Hugo is the very beginning of films.
","Hugo is the very first film that I watched of Oscars nominated films and I love it. It's kind of supposed to be a biography film, but it took the middle way. Because of that, I could watch it.For normal condition, I don't usually watch biography films as I find they are very boring and I don't interest in other people's lives. So, I always avoid them. But I watched this one anyway. Mostly because of Asa Butterfield. He's so cute and Chloe is also cute. I'm glad that I watch this one because this film is very different from some films that I watched.What I love is that we could see the first film that was ever made. Seeing it, it makes me feel warm. 😁All in all is that Hugo is one of the best films that I watched and I believe that this one is the very beginning of the film industry. Hence, everyone should watch it at least once.",8,1,2,15 June 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Weird story and bad animation I've watched in this year.
","Well, this is one of the honest reviews which will get a lot of disagreements. But I'd like to say anyway. So, here is my review.I feel like it's kind of movie version of comic book. The worst thing about it is the animation. Before I watched the film, I really had high hope. So, I didn't expect it would turned out like this. The characters are so ugly. Even Chinese animators can do better job.Weird story and bad animation makes the film (kind of) bad one. So, although it gets high rates and people are giving high ratings, as for me, this is one of the worst animations I've watched in this year.",1,16,56,21 February 2019
Ratatouille," One of the animations that everyone should watch.
","Ratatouille is one of the best animation films I've watched. I watched this one when I was a kid and even I've grown up, I still love to watch it. It's totally amazing.I don't know exactly that some people could enjoy the meal even if they already knew that it's done by a mouse. I mean mice are the dirtiest animals of all. They carry diseases. That's why they restricted mice in the restaurant. The kitten is somewhere to make foods and foods need to be clean. So, it's kind of bad thing that mice are in the kitten. It's the worst that such mice are making food. Who will eat that? But luckily, there's someone.All in all, Ratatouille is something that is highly enjoyable because of it's fine animation quality and all. I totally love this animation very much. If I recommend an animation to watch, I'd recommend this one.",10,1,1,27 May 2019
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Great film with awesome visual effects.
","The film is amazing. You know what I mean when you read Fantastic Beasts and where to find them book by J.K Rowling. To be honest, I didn't read it, I just peaked a little. As much I saw, well, it's just a list of all creatures and who found them, etc. But when they turned into a film, it's superb. Some say the movie is all about visual effects and all, but compared to the book, it's a huge difference. It's like heavem and earth different. The actors performed amazingly and I loved their performances. The plot is good and it's good to see all the amazing creatures. That reminds me to tell about visual effects. The visual effects are very good. I even felt that those creatures were real in the real world. At that time, I kind of wished I was Newt. All in all, it's a great movie like Harry Potter films.",10,0,1,8 February 2018
Avengers: Endgame," A sad Avengers film I've ever seen.
","I'm not that much fan of Avengers series. So, it is kind of difficult for me to review this kind of films. I always see Avengers films are concerning with fights and battles (those kinds of things) but this one is kind of different. It also has some drama. Well, sort of. So, I find it some scenes are a bit boring. But I could watch it. Hence, it's fine.It's so sad to see Iron Man died. But I was touched to see when he sacrificed his life to save a lot of people. And Thanos? He even sacrificed his own daughter just to get the stone. I just wished that Iron Man didn't die. He's sweet guy even though sometimes, he felt like he was better than anyone.Another touchable thing is to see Captain America went back time and married the girl who is he once loved and missed a chance to get her. It's so good to see he finally has a chance to try. Although he became an old man when he went back, but he had great/sweet time with his girl he loves. So, I think it's totally worth it. And that scene is so sweet even though it's so sad to see.There's one thing that I don't understand. About Nebula, past Nebula died. Doesn't mean there's no Nebula anymore? But the present Nebula still exists. If there's no past, how the present exists? 🤔This film ended with sad ending. So, as the one who loves to see happy ending, I'd say it's kind of inferior to the other films which have happy ending. Not all films end with happy ending. That I understand. But I just want to see happy ending. Films are for entertainment anyway. 😁Overall is that Avengers series are always the best even I'm not that fan of it. This film is also a good one too. It gives sweet moments and all. The special effects are good, yet, the fighting scenes are a little bit simple. I want to see more of it and awesome complex fighting scenes. That being said, the current one is doing fine and I've totally enjoyed it.",9,36,56,30 July 2019
Toy Story 4," Touchable, sad and love toy story.
","Toy Story films are really a good film. Some people think that Toy Story animations are for kids, so, adults shouldn't enjoy them. But as for me, whether it's kids or adults, Toy Story animations are really enjoyable. They give us a different view to the hidden world of toys and also different tastes.Toy Story 4 is not just about how toys act when the owners are away, but also it has a love story. At the same time, the story is really touchable. The way Woody can give everything just to save forky and he doesn't want the voice box back even she gives back after she knows it's not working. It reminds me of the story between Wei Wuxian and Jiang Cheng (the truth about the golden core) of Mo Dao Zu Shi (The Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation). Of course there's a little bit of difference. When I saw that scene, it's touched me and so, I cried. Woody is the greatest doll of all.I didn't expect to see the love story hidden in this animation. I really love how Woody could leave Boonie and stays with Bo. I really want those two to be together forever.Sad thing is that Boonie doesn't care Woody. I really feel bad for him. It's really sad to see such a scene. As the one who loves to see happy scenes, that scene is too much for me.All in all, Toy Story 4 is a great animation as every Toy Story animation turned out great one. The story is great and the animation is also great as it always is. I don't care other people say that it's bad, as for me, Toy Story 4 is really great and I've enjoyed every second of it. If they are planning to make the 5th one, I'll be waiting for it to come out because I really love Toy Story animations.",9,3,4,15 September 2019
Non-Stop," Cold, but interesting story.
","Non-Stop is one of the best films of Liam Neeson. The main reason that made me watch this film is because of Liam. His acting is superb, so, I always watch his films. I find it his films are quite good and interesting.Although I'm Liam's fan, I must admit that Non-Stop is quite cold and slow moving film. But I could keep watching it. The reason I kept watching was that I wanted to know who was making all those things.It's taken place on a plane. So, I sometimes wonder what if we encounter the same problem? Will there be someone who would save us? Maybe there is. Maybe there's no. But later, I considered that it's just a film.As I've said in above, the film is quite interesting. And I'm sure that Liam Neeson's fans will find it a great film. Although it's a bit cold, as for me, it's one of my favourite films.",8,1,1,15 May 2019
Aladdin," A fine film with biggest flaw.
","Aladdin was one of my favourite animations that I love when I was a kid. As English language isn't my mother language, so, when I watched the animation when I was a kid, I didn't get the plot that much. So, without understanding that much, it can be said that I watched blindly. Even so, I kind of loved Aladdin. The main thing why I love Aladdin animation is Genie and magic carpet which are really cool. So, when I saw that the live action was coming out, I was kind of exciting to see it.Aladdin story is based on the love story, but what made me interest in the story was Genie and magic carpet. Because of the power they have, they are really cool. I kind of sometimes wonder why Genie only grants for three wishes? Why not two or four wishes? 😁 And also I always wonder if I got that, what would I wish for? 😁The casts are basically fine, but it's kind of weird to see Will Smith as Genie. Although Genie's body is kind of big, but I didn't expect that big. That's why I feel like it's kind of strange to see. And also I don't quite like Naomi Scott as Jasmine. I don't know about her acting in her other films, but she's not that good as Jasmine. I feel like she doesn't fit in the role. So, I prefer the animation for this part.Although Aladdin is a fine film, but there's one biggest flaw. 'Do you trust me?' part is the most important part of all. That was how Jasmine recognised prince Ali is really Aladdin. In the animation, it was fine. But in the live action, there was no the first 'Do you trust me?' part in the scene where Aladdin and Jasmine tried to get away from those guards. If there's no that part, how the hell Jasmine recognise prince Ali is Aladdin? And also saying 'what did you say?' (when Aladdin invites her to ride on the carpet with her) becomes nonsense. So, I'd say there's a big flaw.All in all, Aladdin live action is quite similar to the animation version. There's no difference between them and it can be said it's a fine film. So, I kind of loved watching it.",7,0,5,16 August 2019
Frozen," One of the best animations with one biggest flaw.
","Frozen is one of the best animations that Disney ever made. The story is great and also the animation is also great. I totally love it. It really deserved to get the best animation prize.What I love of this animation film is that they could do it in details. Most of the animators always do in common. I mean if the characters are speaking, they just draw their mouths are moving to look like they are speaking. No one could do it in details. But in this animation, they did it in details. Even how the mouth moves when they speak the words that end with 'f' sound, they actually did exactly the same of how we speak those words that end with 'f' sound in the real world. This is why I love this film very much.One more thing I love is the songs. Those two songs are so good. They are very popular. And a lot of people are loving them. That's why they do it in many languages. Different languages and except for English and Chinese, I don't understand the rest, they seem to be great.Although Frozen is such a great film, there's one big flaw. As some people pointed out, if Elsa could control her powers by wearing gloves, then why would she need to hide in the room for many years? What they said is quite right if you think about it.So, even Frozen has some flaws, it still makes the best one I've ever watched.",10,5,9,25 May 2019
The Lion King," Unnecessary live action film.
","The Lion King live action is something that Disney shouldn't have turned into live action film. The story is very boring. Even animation, I gave up watching. I also gave up the live action after the first scene of the little lion prince is introduced to their kingdom. As for me, that scene is quite touchable. For unknown reason, I even cried. But that doesn't save the film. The film is still awful and it's one of the films that I stopped watching.So, all in all, I'm so sorry to say that if I were you, I'll skip this one and watch the other films.",1,3,3,25 May 2020
Coco," One of the best animation films I've ever seen.
",It's the best heart-touching animation from Pixer I've ever seen. I even cried when Hector was about to disappear. I smiled when the whole family was happy. Beautiful story and so it really deserves an Oscar. *thumbsup*,9,0,1,6 February 2018
The Imitation Game," The best biography film I've ever seen.
","The Imitation Game is the one and the only one biography film I've ever watched. I saw a lot of biography films on local TV channel by accident but never carefully watched it in details. I always find that biography films are very boring and nothing to make me interested in. So, I'm always avoid those kinds of films.I only watched this film because it went into Oscar nominations. When I was checking out the Oscar nominations that year, I've found this film was one of the nominated and I was surprised when I read the plot. Moreover, Benedict Cumberbatch was in it, so, I decided to watch.I always find that whichever films Benedict Cumberbatch is in, they are kind of great films like Sherlock produced by BBC. I love his performance. The way he talks, the way he performs, I love all. That's why I watched this film and I was amazed because of it's quality. The film is so great. Even though the film is based on the second world war, but it's still doing great and I totally love the film.What I love of this film is the proposal scene. It's so funny and cute in some way. Too bad for Joan is that Alan is homosexual. Otherwise, I want Alan to end up with her.Another scene I love is how Alan find his members. That scene is kind of funny and I love those words which one of his members said after Alan solved the Enigma 'you just solved Enigma.....'. When I saw that scene, I smiled.Although those scenes are great ones, the final scene is so sad. Alan is a great guy. He doesn't deserve all that happened to him, especially, his homosexuality. I guess at that time, homosexuality was banned, so, Alan has to go though hell.The final scene makes me angry. All they tried is just to see how strong/secure their code is? When I saw that scene, I really want to hit them.All in all, this film is so great and so enjoyable. Although it is a biography film and I thought it would make me bored, but it didn't. Moreover, it is the best of best biography films I've seen. I would recommend you all to watch because you won't regret watching it since it's a great film.",9,0,1,5 May 2019
3 Idiots," The best Indian movie I've ever watched!
","The review title said it all. Yeah, it's the best Indian movie of all time. It's totally great. The actors are great. The music, the actings and everything is great. It totally shows the education system of our country, Myanmar. That's why i love it. The movie shows the University life is fun and not stressed. A great film to spend your free time. 
As for me, I don't even remember how many times I've watched this movie. If you are searching for a great Indian movie, watch this one. Spending time in this film is totally worth it.",10,0,1,25 February 2018
Beauty and the Beast," One of the best live action films from Disney.
","Beauty and the Beast is one of my favourite animations of all time. I really loved it and so, when I heard about they are making live action film, I was really looking forward to it. When it's out, I immediately watched it.The film is so great. I think they made the right choice of choosing Emma Watson as Belle. She's so gorgeous. And that yellow dress is so cool. It's prettier on her. So, I'd say the costume designer has done an amazing job.The effects on the Beast is quite good. I thought he'd be uglier. But he wasn't that much than I expected. And the performances are also great. I totally was in the movie and forgot the surrounding.Although it is so perfect, I don't like some of those songs that Belle sung. Maybe I'm not that much into original scores. But I still can accept it.Overall is that Beauty and the Beast Live Action is a great film and not inferior to the animation. It's on equal state. The film is so good, so, I recommend you all to watch it. You won't regret watching it.",9,3,4,14 May 2019
Thor," A great film. I loved it! Two thumbs up. 👍👍
","Thor, when I saw this film, I felt it's so odd to call his name. But when I watched it, I gradually felt it's okay. Just kidding. 😂 I didn't feel anything. I just felt it's something enjoyable when I read this film's plot on a website. So, I watched it.The film is so cool. I totally loved it. And also I love the actor. The special effects used in this film is so good. It really looked like so real. Because of it, I think this film turned out to be great one.The scene where Thor had to break the bridge is the saddest scene for me. He had to choose between two things because he couldn't have both. He sacrificed his feelings for peace. I really like how he thought and also what he chose. That makes him to be a great king.As for summary, Thor is one of the best films and my favourites. So, I watched again last night. And I totally loved it.",8,0,0,24 June 2019
Castle in the Sky," The best Japanese anime I've ever seen.
","I rarely watch Japanese animes because they are mostly lack of good stories, awesome animations, etc. Most of Japanese animes I saw were kind of dramas, the animations are very bad and characters are so ugly. Moreover, the stories are not that strong to be my taste. So, I always avoid Japanese animes.I just said that I don't watch Japanese animes, it doesn't mean I don't see one. Some local TV channels in my country air Japanese animes and so, I sometimes see them and didn't like them because the stories are very bad.Laputa: The Castle in the Sky is the first Japanese anime I watched and also it's the only one I loved. When I saw this anime on a website, the reason why I decided was two main characters were kind of cute and lovely. So, I watched it and I loved it.The story is not so simple and not so complicated. But because of the director, it turned out to be a good one. What I love about this anime is how Sheeta and the leader of those pirates became friends.I don't like the castle though. The castle is kind of ruined. Maybe it's because it is ruined in the story. So, the anime creators did like that. But it still works.The anime was produced in 1986 (way before I was born) but the quality is unbelievably good. I haven't a clue before I saw it's production year. When I saw it, I can't believe it because the anime is too good.What I love most is the end credit song. That song is so cool.All in all, for some people, the anime might be kind of inferior to those ones produced in 20th centuries but as for me, it's the best Japanese anime I've ever seen. It's totally worth spending time.",10,0,0,2 May 2019
The Shape of Water," Oscar thinks it's the best, but it's not for me.
","I didn't have my hope that high because it says drama on genre, but I must admit that this film turned out good. The plot was so simple, but even at the nearly end, it still gave me some excitement. But since it's about love and drama, yeah, it's sort of boring for me. But it wasn't as boring as Blade Runner 2049. At least I could finish it in a day. I only watched this film because it was Oscar's best film and it got three more Oscars. So, I wanted to find out how it was the best. But after I watched it, I had a little bit of disappointment. To be honest, it wasn't the best. Maybe it's because I'm not that much into love stories and dramas. If I was, I might say this film is one of the best just like some people said.This film showed the love could occur in different situations and even between different species. There's nothing to consider when it comes to true love. I might think like that if I'm into love stories and such those things.There were basically two main things I don't like. One was the completely naked scene and the other was sex scenes. As for me, my aunt is kind of conservative, so, I was lucky that I didn't watch this film with her. I watched alone. Thus, no one could scold me about I'm watching films with adult contents. I prefer if there were no such scenes.All in all, this film is on average. If you are kind of into love stories and true love those kind of stuffs, this film could be a good one for you. But as for me, it was just a normal film. So, 6 stars only.",6,4,12,8 March 2018

Zombieland," Not that great, but it's not that bad either. Just somewhere in between.
","I didn't know about this film until I saw it right here on IMDB. It was on recommended section. So, I checked it out. And also, I found a film named 'Zombieland: Double Tap' a few days ago. This is how I came across this film.Zombieland, as the title says, it's all about zombie apocalypse which I like to watch. Zombie thing is one of my favourite genres. So, I watch it immediately when I saw this film. Before I watched this film, I didn't have that much hope for this one even though it really has high rate. After I watched it, I found that this film is difficult to rate because I don't know how to rate or write a review. The film is less serious, unlike 'The Walking Dead' TV series. But it has funny things. In some scenes, I laughed out loud. It kind of released me from some stress. On the other hand, some scenes made me feel those are really useless. If those scenes are out of the film, it'd be better. That being said, I admit that I've kind of enjoyed it indeed.So, I really don't know how to rate or write a review. I can't say I like it that much, but again, I can't say I don't like it that much. This is my first time of encountering this kind of situation of how to say whether I like or hate it. Hence, it's kind of enjoyable but it's not that much serious. I'm sort of a girl who likes to see some serious film, thus, this film isn't the best one for me. But again, I kind of enjoyed it and I'd like to see sequel as I'm impatiently waiting for it.Finally, is it true that Bill Murray's house really has private home theatre?",5,1,1,30 October 2019
The Holiday," Seems to be boring, but it's a total fun and sweet film.
","The Holiday is kind of one of the best films I've ever watched. Of course the film is kind of a drama, and seems to be some sort of boring film, but if you carefully watch it, you'll find it's not entirely boring. The plot is so simple and normal or ordinary, but it's totally fun Movie. I really love it because it makes you happy because of it's happy ending.I must admit that exchanging house, cars, everything is kind of crazy and I've never seen it in the real world. But just because it's rare, it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It might exist in somewhere in this world, but it seems to me that that kind of actions is a bit weird and crazy if you're rich.It has the spirit of Christmas, so, I'd say it's the best to watch in on Christmas day. Although it's kind of drama, but maybe the casts and crews are great, the film turned out to be highly enjoyable and it's kind of fun. To be honest, I feel really happy when I watched it.To summarise, this film is very good to enjoy. I admit that I didn't have that much hope for this one, but after watching it, I realised that I was totally wrong. This film is a great film. Jude Law's performance really amazed me. He is one of the best actors of all time. Because this film is very good, I totally enjoyed and hence, it was totally worth watching.",8,0,0,25 May 2019
The Reader," A different version of Kate Winslet.
","The Reader was one of three films (of Kate Winslet) that I watched. When I watched it, I didn't know what's gonna be this film and also, I din't know it's rating. I just watched it blindly. But I kind of surprised. Not because this film was so good, but I felt it's kind of strange.The plot is a little bit weird and confusing. Honestly, I don't quite understand the story. Although it's about Hanna, but I feel like it's about the boy. I think what they want to show is the main character, Hanna doesn't know how to read, and then by some events happened, she learned how to read and so, she becomes able to read and write. And also they want to show her life with a boy who is way younger than her. That is what I guess of the plot.This film shows knowing mother language is very important. Everyone must learn how to read and how to write. That is what we could learn from this film.What I like about this film is that Michael recorded the stories and sent them to Hanna. He knows Hanna loves him reading her stories because Hanna can't read. And I guess Michael also wants to read Hanna stories. So, he recorded while he's reading out loud and sent those tapes to Hanna who's in prison. That's so sweet and cute. I totally love that scene.If there's also what I like, of course there's also what I don't like. I don't quite like the scenes where Michael and Hanna have sex. I feel like it's disgusting.All in all is that because the plot is a little bit weird, so, this film is not a bad film, but it's not also a perfect film either. But it's kind of watchable.",4,0,2,25 May 2019
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," The best of Hobbit series.
","As for me, this film is the best one in the entire Hobbit series. It's not because it's the last film, just because it has some exciting fight scenes. The Hobbit series gives me a different taste. Mostly because the main character and his peoplr are shorter than normal people and so, they are cute. Just kidding. 😁 The main reason is it has a lot of awesome things.As the title says, the five armies. The elf army is the best. I can't believe that Legolas' father is such a coward. I can't even distinguish whether he wants to protect his people, he doesn't want to be part of the other people's businesses for no reason or he's just simply afraid. No matter what it is, he seems to be a coward, so, I don't like him that much.What I love is those awesome scenes where Legolas fight with the Orc. The scene he walks up by stepping onto the bricks when he's falling down is the best in the entire film. I totally can't take eyes from the screen when I saw it.To summarize, this film has a lot of fighting scenes and it's so cool. I can say that it's one of the best films I've ever watched.",9,1,3,23 June 2019
Inception," Great concept, but a little bit confused.
","I didn't know this film in the first place until someone mentioned in a list saying that it's full of twists and turns. So, I thought it might be something interesting and that's why I happened to watch this film. The running time was a bit long. At first, I was a bit lazy to watch. But recently, I watched Avengers: Endgame which has 3 hours of running time. After I watched Endgame, I felt 2.5 hours was nothing. Thus, I watched it.When the film has started, I felt a little bit confused. Maybe because of the presentation style, I was confused for some minutes but I continued to watch. After some minutes passed, I kind of could followed up the plot. Then I felt it's like Matrix film, but later I found out that it's not that much alike. Matrix is concerning with controlling things with minds. This film is concerning with dreams. So, they are very much different.This film is kind of sci-fi film and sometimes, it makes me feel like some sort of fiction. I kind of like the concept, but maybe the presentation style is very confusing, so, it's really a big confusion. Moreover, the dialogues are a bit odd and different. Maybe I'm not native speaker, I don't get some parts. In general, I only get 70% of the film.The performances are not so bad. I really like Arthur character. He's really cute and talented. It's like he's so capable of everything he's facing. So, I'd say it's quite good.Too bad that they didn't show the result of what they were doing. I mean we all know what's going happen and what the result is. But I feel that if they showed the result, it'd be better. It really gives the viewers a lot of satisfaction. And about twists and turns, I didn't see them that much. I feel like it's just so normal.All in all, the script needs to be less confusion and if the presentation style is a bit simple, I'm quite sure that this film will be better.",6,2,2,1 August 2019
Murder on the Orient Express," Drama but watchable.
","The concept and plot is good. I didn't guess the murderer. As usual, Agatha Christie fooled me every time. But there are a lot of things in the movie which I don't like. Firstly, I want to say that it's better than Crooked House. This film is a little bit of drama and a little boring. But at least it didn't make me feel sleepy.Second, the accent is killing the film. I know that some people like to have real national accents. But for viewers, the accent is quite difficult to catch, especially for me. I put a lot of effort on listening. So, I prefer British accent or American accent. Thirdly, it might just me. I don't see the built-in translations for French. Not everyone in the world knows French, you know. Thankfully, the one I watched had Chinese translations, so, I could understand what they were saying in French language.Finally, some scenes are not clearly, especially the camera angle changed when they shot the dead body. The viewer can't see the wound on the dead body clearly. That is the only fact that made me angry. Maybe the director didn't want viewers to be afraid, I guess. But my opinion is that if we could see the wound on the dead body, it'd be great.Finally, the train. That train seriously has one exit door?Okay, all in all, it's not that much perfect but watchable because of the plot.",7,0,2,8 February 2018
Wonder Woman," One of the best films ever made.
","Wonder Woman is one of the best films I've ever seen even if the other people think that the plot is not that much complicated. Maybe because everything is perfect, the film turned out to be a great one.Even though it's a great film, it's so sad to see Steve died. His love on Diana touched me. When he said 'I can save today, you can save the world', I really cried. (And that sentence is my favourite.) His death is the saddest scene in the entire film.Since Wonder Woman is flawless, so, there is not much things to point out in this review. Thus, to be short, this film is highly enjoyable and I totally recommend you all to watch. I'm quite sure you won't regret it because it's really, really a great film. Totally loved it.",9,5,13,23 June 2019
Fifty Shades of Grey," Fifty Shades of Grey aka A Porn Film.

Black Panther," An ordinary film with high rating.
","People might think that Black Panther is a great story and etc. As for me, it's just a normal film. It's all about fighting for the throne. To be honest, I've seen it for thousand times in Chinese films, so, it can't amaze me. And in some way, when I see it one more time, I get sick of it. Thus, I'd said the story was just an ordinary.Even though the story isn't that much very different from those ones I always see, I must admit that the effects are quite good. But it still can't make the film to get 9 or 10 stars rating. They still need to improve it to get high rates.All in all, if they could improve the story and everything somehow, it'd be better than this.",5,0,2,27 May 2019
Cinderella," One of the best animations of all time. A must watch.
","Cinderella is one of those animation films I watched when I was young and I still love to this day. I know it's a fairytale, but I always thought that Cinderella is real. Her life is so pitiful and her love story is adorable and admirable. That is one of the reasons why I love this animation.It's cute that Cinderella can actually talk to mice. And the animals can really understand her, except for Lucifer. He's such a trouble maker.What I like is Cinderella's costume which was created by fairy godmother. The dress is so simple, but it's indeed better than that ugly one from live action film. The songs and original scores are also good too. Because everything's perfect, this animation turned out to be a great one.All in all, Cinderella is old but gold. Thus, it is one of those animations that everyone must watch at least once in their lives.",10,1,2,10 May 2019

Annihilation," Feels like it's a combination of Blade Runner 2049 and 7 Guardians of the Tomb.
","As I've said in the headline, the movie is like a combination of Blade Runner 2049 and Guardians of the Tomb. The plot is normal. As they have stated it's a drama, so, the first 23 minutes is so boring. I wanted to stop watching and I did last night. After having enough sleep, I could finished it this morning. The performance are basically fine. Unlike Mu Ji Zhe, a Taiwanese film I've watched, they couldn't make the audience excited (I mean background sound) even there were some exciting scenes. That's not what I expected from American films. The video effects were quite amazing. That makes me wonder one thing. How could the wild animal that attacked Anya make Cass' 'help me' voice? I really don't know how.One thing they have in common whenever the film has a forest is the same forest. When I saw that forest that Lena walked into, Twilight film came into my mind because they are the same. But this is the fact that I randomly said it and it doesn't count in the review.All in all, it's kind of boring for me. But it's not as boring as Blade Runner 2049 and it does have a point. At least the audience knows what is that Shimmer thing. There's only one part I don't get was the final scene. Kane and Lena's eyes were glowing. Does that mean whoever survived from that Shimmer thing infected with some kind of virus or whatever? They didn't explain and made me wonder. That's why I said it's a combination of Blade Runner 2049 and 7 Guardians of the Tomb. A little boring like Blade Runner 2049 and it's final scene is like the final scene of 7 Guardians of the Tomb. But if you are into some kind of drama, watch it. Who knows, you might say it's a great film and enjoyed it.",3,1,5,19 March 2018
Incredibles 2," It's one of the best animation of 2018.

The story, animation, everything's great. It's so perfect! I totally love it.Although I love it, the only thing I don't like is the underminer thing. The Incredibles are dealing with that underminer guy, but they are just cut off. No more arresting that guy scene, no more. I want to see that guy has been arrested at the end of whenever in the middle of animation.Except that little fact that makes me unsatisfied a little bit, everything looks great and the animation is perfect. I totally love it.",10,5,11,22 June 2018
Warm Bodies," A great film. Very different from those zombie films.
","I didn't know this movie until a friend posted on Facebook that this film is kind of a great film. So, I watched it.This one is very much different from those movies I watched. It's unusual that the lead character is a zombie. I mean normally, directors make films from humans' points of view. They never make anything from a zombie's point of view. But in this film, you'll see it's difference.Changing the point of view makes the film very different and very good to enjoy. Some people get tired of zombie films because every time they see is that zombies are bitting people and people are killing them. But in this film, you'll get the new taste which is one of the best thing of this film.The actors and actresses' performances are very good. I totally love them. Because of their awesome performances, this film becomes better and better.As time passed, we all forget how much old films are good. And some people don't watch films that are over three years old. But this film is better than some films produced in 2018. All in all, the film is flawless and very enjoyable. I recommend you to give it a try. You might not regret watching it.",9,0,0,5 May 2019
