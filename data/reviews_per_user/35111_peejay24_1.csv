Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Critics Are Wrong
","The critics are wrong, but then what is the use in saying that as it is generally always the case. Make up your own mind and see this film and you will not be disappointed. The story is simple for this is an introduction to a much larger story. The special effects are amazing and I felt the acting was great.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
