Iron Man 3," Rating should be R, not for kids.
","This movie would score higher if it had a proper rating. Seems they want to get movies rated as low as possible anymore regardless of content. My son and I have been watching the Marvel Universe movies, this should have been skipped. Its by far the worst of all. Tony Stark talks about 'going to town' on a woman in the beginning. There are a ton of 4 letter words who's use isn't just bad, but they are used in bad ways making it worse than just normal curse words. They also shoot each other left and right, and may as well be a Jason Borne movie the way they shoot each other in the head and blow each other up in this movie. Only difference in this is you do not see the blood splatter. This is one PG-13 where the 13 should be taken seriously.",4,0,1,30 May 2017
Captain Marvel," The WORST of all Marvel movies.
","This movie seemed like Marvel knew they needed a Captain Marvel origin story, so they took some generic story from something else and slapped everything Captain Marvel on it. It was extremely boring. I saw it last night at the premier with my 6 year old. There was a major lack of story, or anything to make me care about what was happening in this movie at all. It was mindless generic story, special effects, mindless generic story, more special effects. What a disappointment! This movie was intellectually empty. When this character comes into Endgame in a couple of months I hope Thanos snaps his fingers again and makes her disappear. It would be worth it to have half the universe dead if they took Captain Marvel with them.I own every Marvel movie, and I will never watch this one again. Watching this has also ruined my expectations for Endgame.",2,60,125,9 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," They are more concerned about race and gender than aliens and the force
","Watching a battle in this movie is ridiculous. They make sure to cut to every race and gender, but no aliens. They might as well have been fighting around our own moon. The men are moronic, only the women are intelligent. They portrait the men as just wanting to blow things up without thinking and are regularly outsmarted by these super genius women. The bridge of the main resistance ship is 100% women, no aliens, NOTHING. Imagine watching Episode 4, without Mos Eisley, without the Aliens helping in the final battle. Imagine Return of the Jedi with no Jabba the Hutt Palace. Everything that made star wars unique and special is dead. They are now complaining about animal cruelty of alien racing animals, and worry about freeing them when the movie was seriously lacking at that point already. If Star Wars 4 were half as bad as this, that would have been the end of everything star wars decades ago. This movie makes Episode 1 look like a masterpiece. Real shame, I grew up watching these and was born in the beginning of the 80s. This movie is so bad I wish they didnt even make 7, they ruined it. I was super excited to see this and took my son. I had zero care about anything that happened halfway through.",1,2,4,30 December 2017
