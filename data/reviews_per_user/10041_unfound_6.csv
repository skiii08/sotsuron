Requiem for a Dream," Disturbing in every way, shape, and form
","Requiem for a Dream, is a film that will have you reaching for the remote........to turn the tv off for all the right reasons. By far, this is probably the most disturbing drug film ever made, because director Darren Aronofsky pulls out all the stops, to make you feel as if you are participating in this drug induced nightmare. He intensifies it minute by minute of screen time, having you experience what these people are going through. A film like this, will not end on a happy note because it will scare you in the sense that you'll never want to see a needle. The performances are top notch. Jared Leto, trying to eschew his pretty boy image, is well cast as a loser with a dream to make money, along with Marlon Wayans (distancing himself from any kind of comedy) as his best friend. The most startling performance by far is Ellen Burstyn, in a role that should've won her the oscar, because it's unflinchingly sad. She plays a woman coming apart at the seams from the beginning, only to have drugs set them off. Jennifer Connelly is a strong actress who ends up whoring herself to make money for her boyfriend's business. This is a film that is worthy to watch in classrooms, if you want to scare your students off drugs forever.",Null,0,0,8 July 2001
Pearl Harbor," Sorry, there's no red carpet treatment......
","I recently read in the San Francisco Guardian newspaper, that 'Pearl Harbor''s producers, wanted to remake 'Titanic' by way of 'Saving Private Ryan', and in it's reference to one of the many harsh reviews this movie received, it called the film 'oscar-baiting' before it proceeded to destroy the cast.        Now, first off, my review of Pearl Harbor isn't as harsh as some critics reviled it, but this movie, is most definitely no 'Saving Private Ryan' and it just breathes 'Titanic'. This $135 million monster of a film follows two soldiers named Rafe and Danny (Affleck and Hartnett), best friends since childhood who are now in the air force, just days before one of history's darkest incidents. In a fit of chance, Rafe falls for Evelyn (Kate Beckinsdale), an attractive nurse, but alas, things change and Rafe is out of the picture (for a while), and Danny falls for Evelyn, and the two embark on a romantic affair, complete with powerful visuals of the two necking. Of course, those visuals are all that you see when you consider the more than overbearing romantic subplot between Danny and Evelyn, as well as Rafe. It's so innocuous that you'll desire for the film to be over. At least half the film is the two making love or kissing or what not, that you'll want to put a gun to your head.        The film, is essentially a summer movie because there really isn't much intrigue, you believe that Pearl Harbor is a truly disastrous moment that is gone but not forgotten. The characters, about every one of them, are very one dimensional and that's a no no for many films that desire to be in the best picture category. Alec Baldwin, Jon Voight, and Cuba Gooding Jr. do however make their characters have real depth because they're all based on real people. But their presence in the film isn't huge, because the film focuses on it's lead characters and their RIDICULOUS triangle of love. I believe Bay and Bruckheimer, (of whom many film aficionados have dubbed 'the devil' and 'the antichrist' respectively) wanted the red carpet treatment. They want the award shows, the endless coverage, and the numerous praises, but their film, doesn't have what it takes to be rewarded those illustrious chances. They're both terrific filmmakers and make a hell of a team as director and producer, but 'Pearl Harbor' shows that Michael Bay isn't ready to get serious yet. He was preaching with 'Armageddon', but 'Pearl Harbor' is a weakness. Spielberg was in his forties when he helmed 'Schindler's List' and 'Saving Private Ryan' (which strangely lost Best Picture) because he was ready for it. Bay hasn't matured as a serious filmmaker yet, and he moved too fast into this film. However, the real power of this film is in the historical incident itself, which Bay orchestrates with a raw intensity. The looks of soldiers as they are being relentlessly shot at and blown up. The explosions are massive fireballs that sink whole battleships sending innocents to their doom, and Bay makes you feel as if you are one of those soldiers. He doesn't portray the japanese as an evil totalarian army, but as soldiers fighting the war, and aware of what the consequences may very well be. Spoilers! One particular image that stands out if the view of endless soldiers carrying themselves through the field covered in burning oil, their faces nothing more than just black masses of people screaming. It's a powerful image, and Bay shows it.     Honestly, I'd say Pearl Harbor is something you can rent, if you haven't seen it in the theaters, you haven't missed anything.Grade: B-",Null,0,0,8 August 2001
Mission: Impossible II," A sequel with enough cliches to kill a small horse
","'Mission: Impossible II' can proudly place itself in the hall of fame of worst cliche movies ever. It's not a bad film, aside from the cliches. John Woo, master director that he is, has his touches to the film. But if you're looking for Woo's spectacular action sequences, forget about it, glory in the days of Hard Boiled and The Killer. Woo's symbolic touches from the mandatory doves to the poetic visuals to a character seeing what the other doesnt, are put in place of this film. His character touches however, don't seem to work as they are riddled with the cliches. If you're looking for a thought provoking film, MI:2 is at the bottom of the list, if you're looking for a brainless summer film, rent MI:2 as you will find some intense action.",4,0,0,23 January 2001
Mission: Impossible II," Relentlessly Stupid
","Synopsis: This sequel to the $183 million grossing blockbuster, has returning agent Ethan Hunt in search of a turncoat IMF agent who has stolen a virus and plots to unleash it on the unsuspecting city of Sydney, Australia. Part of it a plan to become a very wealthy individual in cooperation with a treacherous pharmaceutical executive. With the help of a former lover of the agent, Hunt infiltrates his operations and finds himself enraptured with his new romance, and driven by his job.The Review: I am nowhere near as good as the reviewer on the first page, but I have to admit, 'MI:2' is relentlessly stupid, and borrows cliche after cliche, after cliche. There's nothing funnier than seeing the leading action hero shout 'I'm not losing you!' to the damsel in distress, something we've seen in dozens of films in the past decade. John Woo, quite literally the best action film director today, adds a few deft touches to a film, that is just bad. It seems like all critics want to do is kiss a superstar like Cruise, right on the keyster because he's such a big star. 'Don't take it seriously.' they proclaim, as they do a direct hypocrisy of this statement with virtually any other summer film, because it may not have a big star. If you want a good action film, I suggest Woo's earlier efforts 'Hard Boiled', 'The Killer', and 'A Better Tomorrow II'. His poetry of violence is sprawled throughout these poetic films that are brilliant on their own level. 'MI:2' is completely different from the DePalma film, in thought and action sequence.

Any Given Sunday," Don't let the trailer fool you
","Synopsis: A behind closed doors look at a football team and their ever tumultous season both on field and off. An aging football coach struggles to keep the team together while an up and coming quarterback refuses to stay down after spending time in the trenches. Meanwhile, an aging quarterback contemplates retirement after one injury too many in his career. An unethical doctor's beliefs extend to that of the team when he keeps the players on the field. The team's owner, a ruthless businesswoman with a shoot first, ask questions later attitude threatens the future of the team. All in the midst of this, the team players all battle their own conflicts.The Review: The trailer shows you everything that gives you the impression that this is a hard hitting, no holds barred football film with raw intensity. The sounds of Kid Rock's 'Bawitdaba' only foreshadows what kind of images you'll see in this film that will fuel you with testosterone. The epic scope shots of the field, the roars of the crowd, and the performances of the actors has you thinking this is going to be an unbelievable film. Unfortunately, it's nothing like that. Oliver Stone's take on the football world is nothing more than 'Natural Born Killers' with a pigskin football. It's constant barrage of images filling up the screen only contributes to screwing up the film's narrative. It's because Stone wants to show us the commerical world that is football, but it's just used too much to create an impact. Shot like a football documentary, the performances are all around good, with the always satisfying Al Pacino at forefront as aging coach D'Amato, and Cameron Diaz as one woman who needs to be taken down a couple hundred notches for her ruthlessness. Dennis Quaid and James Woods are given their own space for performances and manage to create convincing characters. Woods is excellent as the ever so conniving doctor. The cast is impressive, with people such as Matthew Modine, Jim Brown, Bill Bellamy, and Aaron Eckhardt contributing worthy performances. More notably is LL Cool J as one of the players intent on playing the game and holding onto his endorsements. Jamie Foxx, a talented comedian is probably given the juiciest part of the film, and his performance is riveting as the cocky yet naive Willie Beaman, the upcoming quarterback who won't stay down. But unfortunately, if you're aiming to see 'The Program', just stick with the said film, because 'Any Given Sunday' is not that film. It's a political statement disguised as a ruthless sports film.

Rear Window," A classic
","Synopsis: A newspaper photographer with a genius for catching the perfect shot, finds himself shackled to a wheelchair after his latest photographic shot has landed him there. Bored, he develops an instinct to naturally look over at the apartment complex that is within his view. His insurance nurse belittles him with questions about why he refuses to commit to marriage, with a beautiful woman faithfully at his side. But within his reach, he notices something peculiar about one of the tenants in his observation, and it's only a matter of time before he's convinced that tenant has committed murder.The Review: Probably one of the best films Hitchcock will be remembered for. 'Rear Window' is stylish in the sense that all the action takes place in one locale, an apartment. The performances are right on the money with frequent co-star Jimmy Stewart playing the unfortunate protagonist, and Grace Kelly as his doting girlfriend and Thelma Ritter as his nurse. Hitchcock develops the film a good hour and a half, setting it up with little subtle hints and surprises, but it's only in the last ten or fifteen minutes, that everything really kicks in. Hitchcock takes the audience out of text, and they are no longer made out to be the observant, but a participant in this film. Voted one of the American Film Institute's 100 Greatest Thrills, 'Rear Window' is an unnerving classic. Definitely a classic film.",Null,0,2,1 September 2001
