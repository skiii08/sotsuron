Sucker Punch," The plan was sound, its execution maybe otherwise
","For starters it was definitely something unique, faltering in those small places which could have possibly made this movie one to remember. Pretty girls battling in high heels is probably not the best way to make a lasting impression with viewers and the fact being they have all done a very good job made it easier for me to like sucker punch. The fighting scenes in the movie could have been better (shorter), not the effects but the whole approach seemed kind of monotonous. And also taking the high roller scene off the reel has probably caused a lot of damage to the movie. Emily Browning(the best reason at first i watched this movie for) more than qualifies for the role of baby doll. Sucker punch is not a movie where every single thing is explained, it leaves the audience to figure most of it out. Looking for an action movie with a brain??- its right here.",7,1,2,20 September 2011
