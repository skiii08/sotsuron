Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It serves its purpose.
","Don't expect any wonderful themes or social issues expressed.  There is a small political message however.  It is just your common summer movie.  It has special effects, and oh how wonderful they are.  It has not the same heart as its predecessor but it has heart all the same.  I went to the theaters in hopes of being dazzled and I was.  It was no real gem of a movie, but it didn't need to be.  I had thought TITANIC was something good until I saw it for the second time and realized that it wasn't.  THE PHANTOM MENACE is just one of your typical summer movies and once you accept this as true you could have no trouble with plot or characters.I do have trouble with one thing.  That is when they describe the Jedis as having 'midichorians' in their cells.  This had not been mentioned in any other STAR WARS movie and made the FORCE seem a little less mystic.I'd also like to mention three other things that I thought were pretty funny.  You will be able to see Warwick Davis, the guy from WILLOW, in a few of the spectator shots at the pod race.  Also one of the Gungans uses something similar to the pain prods in THX-1138.  There is also a small allusion to INDIANA JONES and the LAST CRUSADE when Jar Jar Binks is hanging on to the cannon on a tank.",7,0,0,22 May 1999
Barry Lyndon," It was not Kubrick's most popular, but it was his best.
","Out of all the Stanley Kubrick films, this is the least heard of.  This is a real shame for this is his best work.  Don't ask me why.  You only need to see it to know.  I'll also say that this was the only Stanley Kubrick film that made me really sad. It runs very long, but it is better that way.  It makes it seem more baroque.  Whatever you do, get this movie and watch it.",10,1,2,24 May 1999
The Shining," I completely understand Jack Torrance' anger.
","After reading some of the comments, I wasn't able to realize how some of these people didn't understand how Jack went insane.  I understand how and was deeply moved.  All summer long I am cooped up with my parents without the alleviation of my anguish from my friends.  If someone deep down dislikes or hates the people they live with and hold it in too long, they will slowly deteriorate.  Jack hated Wendy because she was simple and she took his alcohol away from him, or he leads himself to believe that. There was never love there in the first place.I would also like to mention two mistakes that I think are worth mentioning.  When applying, Jack mentions that he had been on the wagon for four, or possibly five, months.  One month later in the story, he mentions the same number of months when it should have been one more.  The second mistake is a technical flaw.  In the opening scenes with the aerial camera following the bug on the sidewinder, out of the corner of the screen you are able to see the helicopter's shadow.  This is when it first shows the car. The reason I mention this mistake is because Kubrick later acknowledges it in FULL METAL JACKET when the characters are flying in a helicopter one of the shots is staring at the helicopter's shadow from the helicopter. Kubrick always did have a terrific sense of humor.",9,0,0,21 May 1999
The Shining," The movie as compared to the book
","This is about the movie THE SHINING as it is compared to the book THE SHINING.  The book was the first King novel I'd read and it was enjoyable. It had better character development than the movie.  Also Jack Torrance's insanity was much more gradual in the book.  That was where the movie was weak. The movie was strong where the book wasn't.  That was the ending.  The book's ending was very weak and fell apart where it wasn't all that scary. In the book the the hotel was frightening up until the ending.  In the movie however, the end was the most frightening and it left the viewer feeling very haunted. I don't usually say this, but I thought the movie was much more preferable over the book.  It's structure remained strong throughout and the scares gradually built themselves up.  One of the most chilling and scary movies I have ever had the pleasure of watching.  They did a wonderful job adapting the book for screen.  John Alcott's straight forward cinematography never ceases to impress me.",9,0,0,21 May 1999
