Skyfall," Well, what can I say? It sucks in it's most complete form. The Legend Killer.
","Skyfall, a fraction of the Bond series, with a promising title for assurance of greatness and an descent of one of the greatest ancestor. To be given such an opportunity and to destroy it is a very difficult job and they have done it with pure perfection! Skyfall, the name of the city where Bond came from, an useless concept in a movie where the agent is supposed to think of new ways to destroy 'evil' and protect the world. This movie falls in line with other movies like 'The Bourne Legacy', 'X-Men : First Class', 'The Dark Knight Rises', movies that have no significance to it's Box set. Bourne Legacy, ironically, destroyed it's legacy with a single move! :) The Dark Knight Rises rose to it's glamour and fell to it's knees with a single knife to the back of the 'Dark One'(which wasn't the techniques of Ras'Al Ghul). X-Men First Class has nothing to offer, no logic, no irony, just a portion of stupidity and crap, which is more than enough, now that I think about it! I haven't watched the previous parts of 007, but now that I've watched this, I'm glad that I'll be feeling happy that nothing can be worse than what has just come to light. If you haven't watched this yet, do not do this mistake. It really is an Legend Killer. It has great graphics..that's it. Everything else has been made room for disappointment, it is just a point of us filling that room. Seriously, I do not understand how someone can say this was a good movie using their brain and have the will to post to share that message to the Internet using facebook. A spy movie doesn't contain spies who talk to each other to get the job done. Spies are classy, they keep thinking of new ways to get out their own messes. They are ready for any event to occur, no matter what age they are. They are built for all circumstances in life, and destroying the character of James Bond, 007 wasn't worth pointing out the message, 'People Get Old'. And, worst of all, M dies! Might not be a bad way to continue a 'story', but the people of an secret agency are not dumb. They cannot break character, and they do not die without a fight. It is not too late to turn away from this awful story, filled with bullshit(Dirt would be saying the movie is dull, but this is filled with loud noises, women-who just take up time for no reason-, and meaningless action--qualifies for the location in the Pile Of Crap). The Sky has fallen, and it cannot rise from this. Because they couldn't afford to use their money and innovative abilities, they didn't use any new gadgets, thus proving to themselves that people can get fooled by the actors and the name of the movie, thus making us a delusional pack of fools. After finding out there are 2 more movies to join 007, I packed my hope up and left for the past--to go back in time-- and watch the classics, where, at least they gave a rat's ass about questioning the story and the way the characters in the movie are. With popularity of the movie to rise so high, the world has gone blind. I can't believe that they allowed this movie to be released. Quantum Of Solace was the last normal-good part and Casino Royale was the last best part, and I don't believe there's a possibility of this series to be good anymore. I'm going to satisfy my disappointment by watching different possibilities of how it could have ended, go to sleep and wake up to another day of disappointment of movies--Frankly, the cracks on the wall give out more better stories, they make sense-- and move on from this horrible day. Have A Good One! :)",3,4,12,3 February 2013
