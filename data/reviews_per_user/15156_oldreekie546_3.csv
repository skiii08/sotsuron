Minority Report," just needed that touch more integrity
","In 2054 Washington, the cop in charge of a pilot programme using human precognitives to detect crime before it is committed is himself accused of an upcoming murder and goes on the run to prove his innocence.Minority Report is a frustrating piece of future-noir; a classic example of a good film which could have been great but for the infuriating compromises of mainstream Hollywood.So much about this film is excellent; the thoughtfully imaged future, taking modern concepts of computer technology, architecture, consumerism and urban living to believable representations of where they are likely to be in 50 years time. Social concepts of disfunctionality, drug abuse, abandonment and invasion of privacy are equally well observed, and done so with impressively little moral comment.The photography is suitably grainy, harsh and washed out, the casting excellent and the premise, very much influenced by American detective fiction, agreeably stuffed with plot twists and memorable characters.There are basically only two things wrong with Minority Report, but they are both serious misconceptions which damage the films integrity and originality. The first involves the action sequences, which jar from the otherwise sombre and realistic tone and put the characters straight into over-the-top superhero territory. Cruise leaps across skyscraper-climbing cars like Spiderman. With the aid of a jet-pack he goes flying across buildings, through ceilings and plummeting down alleyways like Superman. He emerges from frantic fist-fights on automobile production lines without a hair out of place like James Bond.It doesn't need to be like this. Minority Report is an action thriller crying out for realism and suspense delivered by believable human characters with proper physical limitations, not the gratuitous pyrotechnics of comic books. Spielberg shows a loss of nerve here, like he wants to remind us that he can still compete with the Wachowski brothers in the OTT action-showman stakes and never mind how out of place it all looks with the rest of his film.The second mistake is even more grave. Without giving too much away, there is a point about three-quarters of the way through the film when the plot comes to a shocking, downbeat, but entirely appropriate end. It completely makes sense in context of the plot and in terms of the film's, bleak dystopian viewpoint. Popcorn-munchers and action junkies might moan, while still finding it acceptable; finding it true. Instead the Hollywood bean-counters, the marketeers and worst of all Spielberg and Cruise themselves can't bring themselves to go along with it. Faced with the choice between an artistically correct conclusion or a cynical, audience-friendly, uplifting and utterly jarring curtain they pump for the latter. By this stage of their careers both of these Hollywood powerhouses should have the guts to go for what's right rather than what's blandly thought to be commercially acceptable; but neither, it would appear, have quite enough conviction. The dollar wins out in the short term while the film's reputation, which could have been gigantic, loses out almost immediately.The difference between a great Hollywood movie and a merely good one is often simply a matter of courage and integrity in the script, in the cutting room or in the board room. Spielberg and Cruise had another Blade Runner right in the palm of their hands here, and let it slip.",Null,0,0,2 June 2003
Barry Lyndon," Get a move on, Stanley!
","The rise and fall of a lusty Irish adventurer and social climber determined to sleep his way to the top in 18th Century Europe.Elephantine Stanley Kubrick adaptation of Thackery's novel containing all his characteristic detail and realism and equally characteristic flatness and emotional distance.As usual with Kubrick, every frame is painstakingly composed and lingered over in tribute to its own craftsmanship. Actors, landscapes, props and even the weather are designed to emphasise the words DIRECTOR IN CHARGE. From a cold, technical perspective its all very impressive and polished, with a clinical auteur in evident control throughout. Kubrick doesn't so much tell a story as present a lecture in film craft; no wonder the arthouse critics and film academics love him. But there's about as much life, spontaneity, joy and emotional connection in this film as in a dead lab rat; especially in the last hour when Kubrick's attempts to engineer some audience sympathy with his anti-hero are cringeworthy.The acting? Well it never does get much of a chance with Stanley does it? Ryan O'Neal always was pretty wooden but you can almost feel his boredom as Kubrick puts him through the wringer of take after take, with the drained and laboured results so typical of his later films.  Now here's a director who really would have loved digitally created performers to manipulate like a micro-surgeon.",Null,10,18,23 May 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A class act thunders on
","Director Peter Jackson wastes no time with prologues or resume's in this breathless, no nonsense mid-point to his ground breaking trilogy. Apart from a brief reprise of Gandalf's fate to deliver a rousing opening, its straight on from where the original story left off as the Fellowship, now divided into three clear factions, pursue their individual fates.In being denied both a begining an an end, the film  is inevitably more episodic than its predecessor and the story is less clearly defined and progressive. Indeed one of the film's few real flaws is that after three exhausting hours of spectacle the story has not really moved on in any meaningful way. Jackson compensates for this by delivering a full-blooded action adventure, more grounded in genuine fantasy than 'Fellowship' with no compromises made on the more fantastic elements of Tolkien's imagination, such as the tree-like Ents, which might have been by-passed by a less confident director. If the action and special effects are more to the forefront in this effort than the characterisation of 'Fellowship', it is a consequence of the plot and Jackson's need for some rather brutal editing to stick within three hours. It will be interesting to see if his special edition DVD restores some of the character balance lost here. For all that, the actors continue to get plenty of opportunity to show their worth, particularly Sean Astin and Viggo Mortensen, whose heroic, leading man status is cemented here. Ian McKellan and Christopher Lee are dissappointingly underused this time around and even Elizah Wood becomes more marginalised (again a reflection of the book).Inevitably, the real star here is Jackson himself; ceaselessly inventive, bold, uncompromising, relishing the detail and sheer mad imagination of Tolkien's text, he delivers an exhilerating spectacle. What next for the Kiwi Hobbit?",Null,0,0,25 February 2003
