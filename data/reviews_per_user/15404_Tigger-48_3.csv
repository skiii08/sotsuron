The Blair Witch Project," Probably the scariest movie I've ever seen....
","I finally got to see this movie last night, and Oh my God....I was freaked out. The movie goes beyond the traditional jump every 5 minutes. It scares you in not showing you what's in the dark. I felt myself slowly getting more and more frightened during the duration of this movie. As the characters slowly began to lose it, I felt myself losing it with them. This movie definitely scares you with its subtlety: the noises heard in the distance, the cackling, the cries for help. The darkness carries the movie's fear factor. I felt myself holding my breath at several parts. My girlfriend's fingernails dug into my hand at some parts--mainly the end. The end is truly disturbing. The image will remain with you. I was definitely spooked, disturbed, frightened......I'll tell you what: It'll be a while before I go hiking in the woods again.",10,1,2,19 August 1999
The Mummy," Wanna-be Indiana Jones, but not....
","I admit, my expectations for this movie weren't all that high. It still sunk beneath them. The creators of this movie seemed like they wanted to fill the Indiana Jones-less void with this special effects driven movie. It doesn't come close to the cinematic masterpieces of the Indy movies. The movie is so cliched, it's sickening. There are some honestly funny moments. Brendan Fraser delivers his constant one-liners with great, if not predictable, timing. He was the best part of the movie (other than the special effects, of course). He was a delightful distraction from the hokieness that is this movie. I'll admit there were a few suspenseful moments, and some of the action scenes were great, but overall 'The Mummy' lacks in any real cinematic quality. Overall, a cheesy movie with some redeeming qualities. I've given it a 6 out of 10.",6,0,0,9 May 1999
The Matrix," This will blow you away.
","After seeing the trailers for this movie (especially the one where they play Enigma to the slow motion action sequences), I was over-excited to see this movie. Once it finally came out, I walked into the theater with high expectations. The movie far exceeded my expectations. What we have here is a masterpiece of filmmaking. It is visually, as well as intellectually, stimulating. It's a special effects ride with a storyline, an actual plot. The special effects don't get in the way of the story, they enhance it. The action sequences were amazing. The slow-motion technique used throughout the movie gave me chills. The Jackie Chan/Bruce Lee-like martial arts sequences will leave you smiling and wanting more. I felt myself tensing and holding my breath throughout the whole film. And the bullets!! They speak for themselves! The cinematography was perfect. I loved every camera angle, every shot, every extreme close up-fast out, in this movie. The acting of everyone was very well done. Say what you will about Keanu Reeves' acting ability, he did a good job with this movie. He had the perfect look for the character he played. This movie is highly recommended to anyone who is even the smallest fan of sci-fi, cyberpunk, film noir. It will blow your mind.",10,0,0,16 April 1999
