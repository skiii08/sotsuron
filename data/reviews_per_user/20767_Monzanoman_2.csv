Kill Bill: Vol. 2," What a stupid stupid movie!
",After watching the first movie and hated it! I don't know why I even tried to watch the 2nd one. This one is even worst then the 1st kill bill! I could only stand to watch 30 minutes of the second film and had to leave to room. I could not even stand to hear this movie in the back ground as I tried to read a magazine at that point. I lost interest of the movie when Uma was shot in the chest. After being shot in the chest with a beanbag and buried alive she manages to claw her way out. I would not recommend this movie to any one! In fact there should be a rating lower then 1 representing awful. I can't believe people were so jazzed about this movie. I was very disappointed I give the 1 million thumbs down!,1,4,10,8 March 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Is this movie worth the 8.3 rating people gave it?
",I rate this movie 1 out of 10 because of the fakeness this movie provided. The special effects were awesome but the story had no real plot other than revenge. Uma certainly gets her revenge but it's a bloody squirting revenge. I don't take movies to seriously if a person is brutally beaten wakes from a coma paralyzed from the legs down and becomes this expert martial artist. What chokes me is this woman has a fight seen fighting over 40 guys all charging her with swords Uma kicks the crap out of them and has a challenge fighting the one woman. What is that all about? The movie cartoon animation is really great! I would rate the cartoon animation of this movie 8 out of 10. I wouldn't recommend this movie to someone unless they are a die-hard Karate Kid fan. I give this movie 2 thumbs down. Great action flick just not enough to get me to be a fan.,1,3,12,8 March 2005
