The Avengers," The Avengers!
","I would like to preface any comments i have regarding this movie with a confession, i never thought The Avengers Assemble would ever happen. Even when Marvel started to weave the characters and films together (rather cock handedly i thought) i still felt it would be a step too far. The main problem (or so i thought) would be to balance the characters and actors. Indeed, the very thought of Robert Downey Jnr, Edward Norton (replaced here by the excellent Mark Ruffalo), Chris Evans and Samuel L Jackson in the same film is enough to melt even the hardened film fans little heart. This perceived problem is definitely the films major strength, the way Joss Whedon (finally getting his props) allows each character their space to shine whilst adhering to the 'confines' of the super group is exemplary. None of the team are ever neglected, no matter how varied or relative their strengths seem to be. The obvious odd men out here, Hawkeye and Black Widow, get just as much screen time both kicking ass and burping exposition as Stark or Banner do. Its this care and attention that gives the movie its weight, that even when we are watching a 20 minute slew of explosions and flying kicks, we are still pondering the fragile dynamics of the group.The action sequences, although never particularly groundbreaking, are never the less brilliant. Probably the shining light is the emergence of the Hulk. The Hulk has had a checkered cinematic past and its nice to see him finally get the treatment he deserves. Firstly, we get the fragile, brilliant and a little kooky Dr Banner. We are inundated with references to his dangerous 'other self', which serves to amp up excitement for the eventual breakout of Banners monstrous alter ego. We really get a sense of how dangerous The Hulk is, everyone on the team seems all to aware of his power none more so than Banner himself. Watching The Hulk single handedly take down one of the larger shark-like alien spacecrafts was utterly beguiling and left me reeling with excitement. The bench mark for marrying visual effects and emotion in this type of movie was Spiderman 2, to my mind at least. It was the perfect balance between caring for Peter Parker and believing in the power of his alter ego. That's exactly what we get in spades here, whether its watching Thor whipping up a storm, Iron Man deploying his TnT or Captain America wielding his starry shield.Another particular strength is the films humour. Since Batman Begins we have been told that movies have to be darker, edgier and more realistic and whilst i love Batman Begins (and its sequel) i am growing tired of the trend. Here we have a movie that is peppered with fragrant, wholesome humour. Most of this is supplied by everyones favourite smart arse Tony Stark, his witty one liners prop up some of the more lengthy expository scenes and give them a welcoming zip. Also present is Whedons own brand of silly visual comedy which he honed on Buffy The Vampire Slayer. A few scenes continue past the usual action or emotional beat to great comedic effect, for example, after watching Hulk and Thor beat on a few faceless baddies we watch as they recover, the scene should end there but Whedon has us stay around just long enough to see Hulk knock Thor across the room with a single punch. The moment is simple but so effective, it breaks up any monotony accumulated in the drawn out action sequences, breathing fresh air into the proceedings.Everyone (without exception) comes out of the film with their heads held high, even Scarlett Johansson impressed me as the manipulative Russian spy (Black Widow) and that is something i never thought i would say. I hear the argument that all the actors represented here aren't doing anything taxing or game changing but no matter how frivolous the entertainment may be it still takes some craft to make the world believable. Its Mark Ruffalo that steals the show as the tetchy Bruce Banner. It might be down to the unique fact that we have seen a few incarnations of this particular character over the years and therefore have a solid reference point(s) in which to examine Ruffalo's performance. Its his awkwardness that is the key to this performance, we had always seen Bruce as a gifted but tortured soul. Here Ruffalo plays it smoother, we get a man who is seemingly confident, articulate but broken it seems then, that he is always one step from the Hulk (as he states a one point in the film). The Hulk element isn't portrayed so much as an accident (as in previous incarnations) but as a dangerous personality trait of Banner himself. This is a much more allegorical reading of the character and a much more intelligent one. It is far too easy to write him off as an experiment gone wrong and ditch him as such. Banner learns to control his inner demon and tries to follow the path of the righteous man, well, as much as he can anyway.This film easily represents the most satisfying instalment of the super hero movie genre. That's not to say its the quintessential super hero movie, but its the most watchable and enjoyable movie of its kind. It doesn't have The Dark Knight's brooding intellect nor does it have Watchemens genre critique but what it does have is fun. I couldn't believe leaving the cinema that the film was a whopping 2hrs 20minutes long, this is testament to the scripts strength and the films charm and charisma. Judging by the films opening box office receipts, i don't think i need to urge anybody to go see this movie but if its simple, loud fun you want you absolutely, positively cant go wrong with The Avengers Assemble.",6,4,10,5 May 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Inane.
","Peppered with enough pointless slow mo and colourful explosions to keep most people happy Sherlock Holmes 2 is bloated and direction-less. It just about flirts with a vague and familiar plot involving an evil genius and a possible world war but never quite embraces it properly and fully. The film also manages to skip any meaningful character and story progression by virtue of a succession of languid expository sequences and monologues. Furthermore, it fails to engage or involve the audience as its overtly 'clever' central characters have to constantly remind us what is going on and more importantly, why we should care. The trick with this kind of movie is to show us the intellectual merit of our characters but to always let the audience be smarter, it has to be this way otherwise there is no connection, no cinematic symbiosis.It is too easy to lambaste the film for not holding true to the source material, so i wont do that here but it is important to note that the film is astonishingly short on mystery or indeed, any interesting ideas. Instead we get so-called 'clever' disguises, whimsical plotting and an overwhelming sludge of absurdity more akin to that of a Tom Cruise era Mission Impossible film. Finally, Guy Ritchie continues to be director of interest although this is not always due to the importance or success of his films. Indeed, he seems to have a few ideas up his sleeves but sadly gleams too much delight from showing us the same ones over and over again from project to project. How is the fighting between Sherlock and his faceless baddies here any different to Brad Pitt's bare knuckle forays in Snatch? Also, how long can we endure the Tarantino-lite, pseudo-intellectual rumblings of his central characters who seem intent on talking around the films hollow plotting with puffed up similes and mindless metaphors. Anyways, this all results in the movie being a mildly watchable piece of cinematic pap.",4,1,2,29 December 2012
Django Unchained," A masterclass in pulp cinema.
","Django Unchained isn't Tarantino's most consistent work nor is it his best, it is however, still a truly great spectacle.The film initially focuses on Dr Schultz (Waltz) who is a skilled and charismatic bounty hunter. The good doctor soon enlists the help of a hopeless slave called Django (Foxx) who crucially can identify conclusively the men currently on Schultz's kill list. Shultz who is sympathetic to the black slaves of the deep south despite his own morally corrupt profession, soon sees the potential and merit in having Django around. Then the focus shifts as we learn that Django has been separated from his wife and the odd pair endeavour to rescue her from a plantation run by the eccentric and possibly psychotic Candie (DiCaprio).I'll start by stating the obvious, Tarantino is a Cinephile. This often works to his advantage but every so often its a hindrance, Django represents a good case to highlight this. Django's opening two acts are very strong, focusing on character and setting, providing us with a rich and inviting world that is equal parts grim and hilarious. However, much like Tarantino's more recent efforts Inglorious Basterds and Kill Bill, Django suffers from an odd and inconsistent tone. When the film is funny, it is very funny. When it is sad, it is truly heartbreaking (see all of the numerous torture scenes). However, when the shoot-outs and action began, by and large i switched off. The violence here is campy (as are most of the performances) but there is an odd cinematic grandiosity that simply isn't present in much of the rest of the film. It is strange to focus so much on character and development to dispel it so whimsically with a series spurts and loud bangs. Its mainly the last act that is afflicted with this problem, bullets fly and blood is spilt but the films bite and feeling gets lost in the mêlée. Django himself soon becomes a caricature, he becomes the movie equivalent of what his character sets out to be at the start of the movie and this is a shame. Thus, the last 45 minutes is shade too light and throwaway, seemingly at odds with the world Tarantino painted with his first hour and 45 minutes.The above being said the film is still masterfully crafted. Everything from the tawdry vernacular (i wont comment on the rights and wrongs use of the N word), to the costume design right through to the performances are simply sublime. Waltz, Foxx and DiCaprio are all great as the various shades of humanity on parade but its Waltz who again steals the show. His charming, effervescent musings mixed with his unwavering empathy make Schultz a force of nature from his brash entrance to his heroic exit in the film. All of the Tarantino-isms are present, the fluid use of time, witty villainous monologuing, extreme violence and an expert use of cinema language. Tarantino shuffles his deck like few can and once again shows why he is a true original. Most films struggle to nail down one mode or tone and Tarantino valiantly tries (with varying success) to juggle a plethora of moods with an intelligence and arrogance few can match. Case in point is the films tongue in cheek seriousness, even in the face of Django's vengeful retribution the film isn't afraid to jolt straight back into farce with the wink of an eye.It might be a little long for some and it could have been wrapped up more cleanly but hey, thats just not the Tarantino way. I think a more straight forward, more succinct ending would have been more effective than the one offered here but Tarantino is much more comfortable being subversive and revelling is his ever colouful, lovingly created pastiches. So in short, this is an often great but ultimately solid piece of cinema and yet another interesting chapter in the already bulging book of Quentin Tarantino.",7,3,8,10 January 2013
Zero Dark Thirty," Bigelow's Masterpiece?
","Zero Dark Thrity is the new movie from Hurt Locker director Kathryn Bigelow who has enjoyed a rich and varied career to date which will surely be swamped under the weight of opinion lumped on this picture. She is a highly adept film-maker and the aforementioned Hurt Locker might just be the finest example of a war movie since Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket. Zero Dark Thirty is a different beast altogether. It is a fact-based account of the events leading up to the killing of Osama Bin Laden. Its a touchy subject which is largely handled with great care and aplomb by the cast and film-makers. Thats not to say the movie is perfect, its actually far from it.The movie is talky without being overly analytical or detailed. I learned nothing from the 157 minute runtime that i couldn't find out in 20 minutes on the web, but maybe that's the point. The word chronicle is often bounded around when talking about Zero Dark Thirty. Chronicle is defined as 'A factual written account of important or historical events in the order of their occurrence' and thats precisely what the film is and not a touch more. There is no meat offered to the viewer by way of engaging character or story development, indeed, the film is mostly an anti-cinematic experience aside from the last 20 or so minutes. An interesting counter point is the popular 'Homeland' show which also charts a driven female CIA agent as she tracks a known and dangerous terrorist. Its true that both works have completely different end-games but it is interesting to note just how far removed the two are. Homeland is purely for entertainment purposes and Zero Dark Thirty strives to be factual and relevant. I would argue that Zero Dark Thirty could have never won over every critic and begs the question, can you really expect to make a piece of solid entertainment about tracking and killing Osama Bin Laden? The answer is no. They would have been surely lambasted for glorifying a potentially inflammatory event (please see Oliver Stone's dreadful 'World Trade Center'). Therefore, we are left with this glossy, extremely well made, pseudo-documentary which is never particularly involving or like-able. Also with all due respect, Chastain can count herself very lucky to have just been nominated for best actress. She was surely a shoe-in for the Oscar nod for just turning up here as the film lends itself, due to its 'factual' nature, to receiving the adoration of the academy. Her performance, much like the film, barely exists but to prop up and relay the events. She cries when people die and she is cast iron in the face of a male dominated, scary world but she is barely a character in her own right. People aren't talking about Maya's dominance of the screen, they are talking about the half-truisms of the events themselves. I'm not asking for any meaningful superfluous back story or exposition but i wanted to see her out of the situation, if just for a few minutes. As an audience we need to know the characters aside from them telling us what is going to happen in the movie. Don't get me wrong, Chastain does nothing wrong here, its more a problem with the writing or maybe just with the style of movie they were trying to make here that breaks her for me. Another interesting counter-point is Ben Affleck's excellent Argo. Here we have a movie based on some pretty harrowing true events but its handled with a cinematic eye. Affleck takes some liberties with the truth in Argo but what he does make is a piece of cinema that excites the audience, involves you in the picture and the characters completely and most importantly stays with you after the fact. I felt nothing at Zero Dark Thirty's conclusion, even when watching Chastain cry, i didn't appreciate the action or care. I didn't feel anything for her character, i knew her about as well as i did Osama Bin Laden (movie equivalent of course).I think my main problem was with the point of the whole exercise. Its a film that sits on the fence, never glorifies or revels nor does it offer any comment or insight. So what then was the point? Do we really live in a world where is it necessary to make a film about every important event in history? How is this any different to watching a fluffy news story? Do we really need attractive people on the silver screen for people to give a sh*t about whats going on in the world? I hope not.All of that being said, Zero Dark Thirty is never an exercise in patience, it rumbles along at a steady pace and if all your looking for is a chronicle of events post 9/11 you'll find a lot to be interested in. I just cant shake the question, what was the point?",6,26,51,11 January 2013
Prometheus," Stupid, bloated and only midly entertaining.
","Ridley Scott's much anticipated return to the sci fi genre is finally here and is likely along with a certain not so friendly neighbourhood bat, to prop up the summer box office. I must say however, that Prometheus is not a popcorn flick, it strives for the lofty heights of such sci fi fare as '2001: A Space Odessy' it rarely even approaches those heights.Prometheus concerns a group of explorers who lead a expedition to find the origins of man. Two members of the expedition had recently unearthed clues relating to a distant cluster of planets in the furthest reaches of space and the crew set off to meet their maker(s). The plotting is lose and the narrative scope is massive. Ridley Scott as per usual fills the visual landscape with a tapestry of treats, feeding even the loneliest deserted landscapes with hidden mystery and encroaching dread. Its the films anima that struggles to surface, what is Scott's true intention? What is the whole point? The ship Prometheus isn't a prominent enough character for the film to be a chart of its lonely journey, so we are left with the shreds of emotion and hammy dialogue to which to pick any cinematic merit. I cant help but reference Roger Ebert and hark back to his sentiments regarding Scott's excellent 'Blade Runner' in which he says 'It looks fabulous, it uses special effects to create a new world of its own, but it is thin in its human story.' Here we have the same problem, we have a very human centric story but we get stiff and synthetic characters to feel it out. Unlike Alien or its sequel, Prometheus suffers from a humourless and flat crew, their looks are stern and the dialogue is cloaked but there is never any real pay off.The writing is spotty and suffers from a hotch potch of ideas, it feels like a world was synthesised around a central idea and the script was secondary. The movie feels like one big theological Trojan horse but in eventuality its a cracked empty shell. Don't get me wrong, i was excited by the prospect of someone tackling the eternal question but to see it displayed so lazily is heartbreaking. Certain characters seem to be motivated by a historic sense of Hollywood logic, bad people do bad things for no apparent reason and (apparently) good scientists seem intent on forgoing actual science and reporting to satisfy their own illogical need for answers. There are more than a few trophy moments too, including a pointless 'love making scene' (which then leads to the films most insane sequence) and a heroic suicide which is completely out of the blue in terms of story and character. The film also follows a way too familiar pattern, it feels like you could almost run the movie adjacent to Alien and it would follow almost to the second its emotional beats. Sombre openings give way to discovery, discovery turns out to be very negative and things get very heavy very quickly. As a by-product of the writing, there are problems too with the acting, here we have a who's who of British (almost) talent and they sadly exist solely to toe the line. Idris Elba for example, does what he can with the role of 'Janek, The Captain' although his poor southern American accent is distracting and his character lacks meat and drive. He says meaningless things and acts exactly like every other captain on every sci fi ship we have ever seen since 'Star Wars'.Its not all bad, the creature design (as to be expected) is absolutely breathtaking for the most part, particularly the 'human aliens' which are stunning with all their Greek mythological referencing. Its a shame then, that these creatures aren't given more time or weight, they seem powerful but rarely display it until the films hurried and confusing ending. The action set pieces are all vaguely familiar but none the less enjoyable although the 3D adds nothing and if anything, is ultimately a distraction. The final set piece involving the alien ship is memorable and genuinely exciting but nothing i haven't seen a thousand times before in a film with half the budget and media hype. Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender are good as the two main driving forces of the piece but eventually they suffer from an odd unlikeability. They are too defined by their mission and the movie and not as fully fleshed out characters outright. I felt that the movie would be an exercise in psychosis much like the enjoyable 'Moon' or dare i say it the now cult classic 'Event Horizon' but the film is more about the beautiful aesthetics and a strange new world. Its funny then to watch Scott make his own version of 'Avatar' where his ego and supposed eye take precedent over any meaningful story. Note also, the vague socio-political mumblings under the films decorative canvas which is never fully realised and thus completely wasted.Promoetheus's main problem is its confused subject matter, here we have a film that can never answer its own question. Therefore, no cinematic satisfaction was ever going to be gleamed from the films finale, the film then seems to triumph the very human need to know how or why we came to be. The film seems to suggest that we may never know and it may cost our lives to find out but we must try, which is ultimately unsatisfying and frustrating. Within this framework then Scott could have still delivered a piece of cinema instead of falling blankly between two very disparate stools. Prometheus is never solidly an actionere nor is it clever enough to be 'A Space Odessy' or the like, it simply just exists, much like life on our planet, i guess.",4,1,3,5 June 2012
Taken 2," Dreadful.
","Taken was a rare movie that somehow captured the hearts and minds of the cinema masses without being particularly good. Taken 2 is much worse. Its like the grey-scale version of the first film, there is no plot, no direction and it has a amazingly juvenile script. Its hard to believe any adult human beings were involved in making this movie.Don't get me wrong, Liam Neeson is by all accounts a good actor but I've rarely seen a performance of such disconnect and disinterest. All he does here is punch and mope. Neeson's Mills is barely a character aside from his mumbled, failed, half cocked one liners. Also, Famke Janssen presents one of the single most insultingly bad performances i've seen in modern times. I found it hard to sympathise with anyone in the film, everyone is so unlikeable and stupid. Watching Maggie Grace prance around in her knickers throwing grenades and drawing circles was also dreadfully misplaced and laughable.There are a few non sensical, Hollywood moments too, such as sinister terrorists using flimsy plastic ties to try and hold a dangerous 'spy'. Or when Neeson drives through the American embassy blockade for no other reason than to see some bullets fly and to re-affirm the notion that he will never ever be hurt. The movie also seems to be heavily edited at choice moments of violence; this was surely to secure the coveted 12a rating helping the movie to be seen by as many adoring juveniles as possible. A good example of this is in the films rushed ending where a few kills happen without defining shots or sound-effects which was ironically more painful to watch. We have seen this trend before especially with the more enjoyable Die Hard 4 in which lines were clearly re-dubbed and violence was trimmed needlessly.The fighting and action should be the saving grace but its difficult to follow and uneventful at best. There are so many better movies that have done this very thing much better, so why bother? It tries its hardest to look exactly like and to be as exciting as The Bourne Movies but fails miserably on both counts.This movie is a complete and utter failure.",3,24,45,7 October 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," subversive but unsatisfying.
","A group of witless teens travel for a weekend out in the woods, only to find that they are being hunted and killed by a malevolent evil which might not be all that it seems.It is a difficult line to tread, to both intellectually engage your audience whilst ultimately giving them what they want. Meta-horror has experienced a checkered and relatively unsuccessful life since Wes Craven re-opened the box with New Nightmare. Subsequently, we have been treated to such delights as Scream, Behind The Mask, Trick R Treat but for every (relatively) successful movie we have had to sit through dirge like 'The Cabin In The Woods'. Its a movie that seems to revel in thought of its clued in audience pointing and laughing, picking up its silly and needless references to better movies. It forgoes any weight and intensity to firmly pat its own back. Its a movie that seems to forget about the genre its poking fun at, whereas the best meta-horror (or self aware horror movies) are the ones that can equally scare and pick apart. Behind The Mask is a good example of a movie that shatters the veneer of the slasher movie whilst actually being a great slasher movie.OK, the central premise is quite enjoyable and well conceived but the screenplay it has sprung is lifeless and uninspired. The writing is subversive and hokey to a fault for example, the scene in which the twisted hill-billy is on speaker-phone serves only to break the film entirely and is insultingly mis-placed. I liked the idea of the 'directors' changing the characters to fit the mould of a horror movie but it was done too obviously. Maybe this idea (or its execution) would have worked much better as a short film or even as a mini series. Indeed, it seems that the humour and some of the ideas are lifted straight from Whedons other creations such as Buffy and Angel. Within that format there is much more scope to be inflammatory or tonally subversive as you can just pick up the normal story arc next week (the musical episode in Buffy is perhaps the best representation of this). I think in cinema this has to be more subtle or cleverer or else you alienate your audience. By the end of the picture, i didn't care one sh*t for either character or what was going to happen to the world if the cinematic tropes weren't fulfilled, i was just praying for the curtains to roll.It is clear then that 'The Cabin In The Woods' left me cold. It wasn't overtly funny enough nor was it innovative in its scares to warrant its tidy billing and after all is said and done, it was just another good idea chopped up and left for dead.",4,2,4,10 September 2012
