The Blair Witch Project," Unfairly maligned classic
","It's a great shame that The Blair Witch Project is probably going to go down in film history as an over-hyped gimmick, endlessly lampooned by all and sundry, and rejected by the horror fraternity.I couldn't agree less. I loved it. It's very. very rare that a film will affects me physically, but even watching Blair Witch on video was an adrenalin rush for me. There were times when I felt like standing up and cheering. This is audacious movie-making, breaking all the conventions of the genre (and most conventions of any genre) and pulling it all off brilliantly. It seems hard to imagine just a few years down the track, but this was a trailblazer of a movie. I also believe it to one of the very best horror films ever made, and certainly the best in the last 25 years.  Please note, I am not a horror movie buff. And herein lies the rub.It quickly became apparent to me, after talking to many people who slagged off the film, that their predominant reasons for doing so were that it didn't have any special effects or gore, and that they were somehow offended by its low budget look. In other words, horror is about mindless violence, not psychological suspense. And apparently it isn't about waking up at 3 am the next morning with you heart in your mouth, because you suddenly understood what that last scene actually meant.Maybe two or three times a decade a film comes along that changes the course of filmaking. In the 90's, the first two which spring to mind for me are Pulp Fiction and Blair Witch. Bravo.Oh, of course the sequel is absolute rubbish...",Null,1,2,12 October 2002
Minority Report," Philip K Dick is shortchanged again
","*** Contains Spoilers ****sigh*  Philip K Dick was one of the finest, maybe even the finest SF writer of the second half of the 20th century. The science fiction movie of the 90's has just caught up with what Dick was doing in the 50's and 60's. Films like The Matrix, The Truman Show, Dark City, Pleasantville, and The Thirteenth Floor are so obviously and totally inspired by PKD and his endless interrogation of the nature of reality that I really think if he were alive, Dick could probably just file suit against Hollywood in general. NONE of these movies credit Dick in any way, and they're ALL good. So why, oh why, whenever someone gets hold of an actual PKD story and film it, do they make such a mess of it? (Bladerunner excepted, but Dick was still alive for that one).Minority report has one great thing going for it: the central idea of citizens being arrested and punished for crimes they HAVEN'T YET COMMITTED, on evidence provided by gifted precognitives. Unfortunately it's the only really good thing about Minority Report the movie, and Steven Spielberg had nothing to do with it.Most of my criticisms have been covered below. Inconsistent, uninteresting future world, bad pacing, lapses into sentimentality (and stupid gags), irritating, overexposed cinematography (I've watched films in sepia before, but this is the first one I've watched in chrome), and some really bad plot holes.Oh, BTW, before I get on to the big spoiler - I realised something while watching this movie. I'm sick of CGI. I really am. This movie is like the last Star Wars. Every outdoor scene is crammed with billions of things whizzing all over the damn place, and what's more they somehow just don't look real. I don't find this exciting anymore; I just find it tiring. Compare this maelstrom of whizzing whatnots with the sparse, ominous sets in Kubrick's 2001.Ok.... QUITE A MAJOR SPOILER COMINGI admit that if I have read PKD's original story Minority Report, it must have been 20 years ago, and I don't recall it. I mostly read his novels. But I am willing to guess that Dick would have gone some way to explaining this scenario, if indeed it existed in his story:Tom Cruise's character has been accused of a murder he is yet to commit. The supposed victim is someone he doesn't even know, and he rightly rationalises that it's unlikely he would be going to commit this murder. It's due to happen in about 20 hours, and meanwhile he has escaped and is on the run. He has managed to elude capture so far.Can someone tell me why his response to this situation is to have his eyes gouged out by some sadistic backstreet doctor (who used to set his patients on fire and make movies of it), disfigure his face, and then sneak into the pre-crime center, which is the place he is most likely to get caught (somehow the security scanner still recognises his retinal scan from the eyeballs he's carrying, despite his being wanted for murder. In fact they still work when his wife uses them, after he's imprisoned), and then abduct a pre-cog and rush off with her, with the whole Washington police force in tow, en route to the supposed future murder scene?Why doesn't he just sit somewhere safe for 20 hours and wait until the murder doesn't happen, proving his innocence by simply doing nothing?This is two bad SF movies in a row for Spielberg. Elsewhere I have given one of his movies 10 out of 10. Minority Report scores a 5.Oh, and could someone make a movie of one of PKD's NOVELS? What is it with this short story thing? It's the same curse that seems to have befallen H.P.Lovecraft. Let's see UBIK, or The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, or A Scanner Darkly. Only please find someone else to direct it.",Null,0,0,20 January 2003
Mulan," Very good, but not classic.
","Mulan is just about Disney's last really good 'classically animated' style movie (at the time of writing). The whole thing has a pleasing, mildly intoxicating atmosphere to it. There are scenes of considerable emotional impact, mixed with sufficient comedy and adventure, and some really nice landscape shots. Eddie Murphy, though slightly annoying as the salamander-thing, has not at this stage developed into the outright annoying animated voice-over artist which would come with Shrek.The film could have strayed into irritating political correctness (G.I. Jane in Ancient China), but it pretty much manages to avoid this. If you can put up with the silly American accents used for Chinese characters, I'd recommend Mulan. Particularly in a visual sense, it has the feeling of a traditional oriental painting at times. I'd sooner watch this than anything by Disney I've seen since (though nearly most of them have been at least alright)",7,1,2,8 April 2004
Fight Club," Well, you can tell THIS one was made before 9/11...
","That was my overwhelming feeling on re-watching 'Fight Club' last night. Could you imagine this movie being released after 9/11? And I think that  if I can take that a little further it might speak to the generally unadventerous, uncontroversial, scared to put a foot wrong film making which has been coming out of Hollywood in the past three years. But we don't have room for that here.I watched Fight Club when it was first released and I didn't like it. In fact I disliked it so much that I turned it off 3/4 of the way through. Watching it four years later I can't imagine why I didn't stay riveted to the set. Maybe back in 1999/2000 it had a bit more meaty competition.Yet another film which you really can't talk about in too much detail without spoiling, but let's allow this much: the main character is a yuppie who, through a chance encounter with a charismatic stranger on a plane, discovers the hollowness of his life, and uses physical violence and self-injury as a means of liberating himself from it. Or so it all seems...This is an audacious and confronting movie, artfully put together, with lots of lovely scenes where the whole illusion of film-making is highlighted. Characters suddenly speak to the audience or walk through a scene which morphs into a furniture brochure. And there are more, and more pivotal shocks of this kind to come.  It's funny, smart, unexpected, brutal, and takes no prisoners.  The only thing which lets it down and keeps it from being an almost perfect movie, IMO, is that the ending (an albeit marvelously unexpected ending) just starts to push credibility to its breaking point, even for a film which doesn't take itself entirely seriously.Still, this film is currently averaging a score of 8.5, and I'd say that's about right.",9,1,3,10 June 2004
Bloody Sunday," How NOT to make a pseudo-documentary
","I've read review after review stating that this movie is made in a documentary style. I don't agree. The purpose of a documentary is to convey information. Generally there will be a narrator. If there isn't, then there will at least be an introduction; a background of some sort.
There is none of this. To many who weren't already familiar with the events and background to the massacre, this movie must have been a frustrating and confusing affair. Scenes shift leaving you with no firm sense of the geography of the action, which is really crucial to understanding events on a purely physical level.Worse, the film tries to have it both ways by having 'characters', except these characters are so poorly realised that even the major ones are sketchy in the extreme, and the incidental ones are sometimes plain bewildering. I felt little compassion for most characters in the movie, because: the producers evidently didn't feel it was important enough to give the slightest background or character development. Even if this HAD been a real documentary, the narrator would have at least told us SOMETHING about the subjects being filmed.Oh, I don't know. Really - I don't know how anyone could make a movie about such an emotionally charged and compelling subject, and end up making it dull, but I found myself alternating between boredom and annoyance for at least the first half of the movie. Admittedly it did pick up somewhat towards the end, but even then the emotional impact was blunted by a total lack of identification with any of the characters.There were a few exceptions: the British army officer who asked 'why not just let them march', and then sat impotently and listened to the thing unfold. But again I find myself thinking, this could have been done so much more effectively in a conventional dramatic narrative.It wasn't a bad film: the acting was excellant, from the POV of it appearing genuinely spontaneous (in fact I suspect much of it was improvised) but my main impression was of a well intentioned film with a talented crew and cast simply going wrong because they tackled it the wrong way.",5,6,15,12 September 2003
The Day After Tomorrow," Shallow Impact
","*contains what some may consider minor spoilers*I watched this on election night in Australia. A disaster movie seemed like a good idea.Actually I'm kind of fond of good disaster movies. Lived through the original craze as a kid, starting with 'Poseidon Adventure'. You learn not to expect anything profound - just some well done, big-scope action/adventure fun in a well-done example. Such an example of the more modern variety was 'Deep Impact', which was followed by a parade of increasingly more tedious clones, right down to the utterly awful 'Tychus'.Whereas 'Day After Tomorrow' isn't that bad, it's no 'Deep Impact', either. Maybe it's the subject matter. Having run out of disasters to have disaster movies about, the makers of 'Independence Day' turn to Global Warming. Only trouble is, this is a cataclysm which takes place over decades, or maybe centuries, so they speed it all up into a few weeks. Unfortunately not even this is enough to obscure the fact that, in disaster movie terms, watching things get frosted over really quickly isn't exactly jaw-dropping.The first 45 minutes or so are fairly strong. The appropriate sense of awe, as in 'something awful is coming', with scientists trying to convince skeptical politicians (including a VP who looks far too much like Dick Cheney to be coincidence), and people saying 'Oh my God' in hushed voices a lot. You've seen the same thing in 'The Towering Inferno', 'Deep Impact', 'The Arrival', perhaps even 'Contact'. It's what happens when the action part of the film eventually gets under way that lets everything down.A tidal wave hits New York (this isn't a spoiler, since it says so on the back cover). The thing is, there is zero build-up to this, nobody says 'Oh, my God, a tidal wave is going to hit New York' in hushed tones; and when it does arrive, frankly it's rather sluggish-looking. Even the tornadoes in LA are sort of blown off (if you'll excuse the expression) without summoning what should have been the appropriate amount of awe and dread.What really kills the thing though is having Dennis Quaid trudge for ages across the snow while his son sits about in a library in Manhattan. There's nothing really wrong with the film moving into this phase. Every disaster movie has its narrow-focus human story part, after the macro-focus cataclysmic event part. It's just that whereas in say, 'Poseidon Adventure', this part was genuinely exciting, in 'Day After Tomorrow', it's genuinely dull.Unlike some disaster movies, this one isn't a disaster itself, but it fails to deliver much beyond the opening sense of awe. Not quite 6 out of 10.",5,0,0,11 October 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," What are you all thinking?
","Ok, this is really not a review as such, so I'll keep it brief.At the time of writing, the IMDb users have this movie voted as the #4 best movie of all time. Why?  Are you all out of your minds? To me it's riddled with problems. Sure it has some nice cinematography, but the character development is incredibly superficial (and I mean down to the point that if you hadn't read the book, you probably wouldn't even remember who some of the major character's names were until you'd been watching the movie for 2 hours).Jackson has 3 hours to try to convey Sam's devotion to Frodo, and the individual pesonalities of the other three young Hobbits, but by the end of the movie Sam is only just beginning to fill out as a character, and the other two are just cardboard cutouts.To be fair, the film begins well, is often glorious visually, and ends well, with some great action sequences in the last 45 minutes, but well before then I was getting bored and losing interest in the lethargic middle section, which seemed to contribute nothing much of value except some plot details which could have been revealed far more quickly.It's not a bad movie at all - I gave it 6 out of 10 - but you blokes have it rated above dozens of cinema's all time greats. Come on, you've got to be kidding. There's no way a movie this imperfect deserves to be in the top 100, let alone the top 4.At least it's way better than Ralph Bakshi's atrocious 1980 attempt, but for me this movie just proves what I suspected all along. No film is ever going to do justice to the book.",6,1,2,7 August 2002
Dark City," Dark, moody, clever, and quite silly
","First, just for the record, this film did not rip off 'The Matrix'. It came out a year earlier. Such arguments seem pointless to me anyway, since the basic premise both of these movies, plus 'The Thirteenth Floor', 'The Truman Show', 'Pleasantville', et al are so blatantly appropriated from Philip K Dick's SF of the 1950's. Never mind that, though. This is another 'What is reality' film (a question Dick apparently used to pose himself every morning); this time the variation being that an alien race has abducted a city of humans and is performing experiments on them to try to find out the nature of the human soul. That isn't a spoiler, BTW. In fact the very first thing that happens in this film is that the narrator tells you what I just told you. You can't help but wonder if it might have served to achieve a better sense of mystery if they hadn't thought to lay that on you in the first 30 seconds, but the film manages to be quite suspenseful all the same.'Dark City' is directed by the bloke who brought us 'The Crow', which I thought was utter rubbish. It has a similar dark, stylised look, which will probably appeal to goths - but in 'Dark City' there is at least a reason for this perpetual night. 'Dark City' is SF, nominally, but the kernel of hard SF which mostly emerges (quite pleasingly) at the end of the movie is subsumed by the complete stylization of the movie's visual elements. There really isn't any need for the aliens to all look and talk like Riff-Raff from 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show', for the scary, gruesome, dark sets - for the fact that people are driving 1960's cars around and wearing 1940's fashions. There is no need to have an evil little kid alien, or for the aliens to all chatter their teeth when they do something ominous. You have got get over the silliness of this sort of stuff and appreciate that it's just part of the weird, atmospheric world the director has created. Really it all owes as much to comic book horror and super-hero stuff as it does to traditional science fiction.'Dark City' is the sort of film which can easily annoy you if you allow it to, but if you can forgive its affectations and the fact that it doesn't even attempt to explain various obvious logical oddities (e.g. why don't people who collapse face-first in a bowl of porridge drown after a few hours?) then the film can win you over as the hero goes through his version of taking the red pill (or was it the blue one? I always forget.)This film also raises several important questions about Kiefer Sutherland. How come his glasses don't fall off when he's hanging upside down? Why does he speak haltingly, stutteringly, EXCEPT when he's stressed out? Did he just get this job because his dad knew the producer? Fortunately Sutherland's typically ridiculous acting is balanced to an extent by William Hurt as Inspector Bumstead (honestly!) - the cop who's chasing after the hero. Hurt is, as always, almost completely devoid of personality, and looks as if he's in a trance most of the time. Of course he's always like this, but in this movie it actually makes sense.Rufus Sewell is fine as the hero - the guy who 'wakes up' - and so is Jennifer Connelly as his 'wife'. The aliens are all over the top and silly, and they float through the air and chatter their teeth, but like I said, you have to just think comic-book, and you can forgive it all.In some ways 'Dark City' is a film that I hate myself for liking, but the truth is it's a pretty darn effective, if somewhat ridiculous SF story, and what makes it work are precisely the things that make it silly. Go figure. 7 out of 10.",7,32,44,4 June 2004
Spirited Away," Amazing
","About ten minutes into 'Spirited Away' you realise that this movie is going to be totally unlike anything you've ever seen before - even the director's previous movies. Half an hour into the the thing, you feel like you're witnessing some sort of collision between Walt Disney and David Lynch. Put simply, 'Spirited Away' is damn weird - sometimes charmingly weird, sometimes excitingly weird, but sometimes just plain old what the hell is a 'stink spirit', and why does it have a bicycle stuck in its side type weird.
If you think that is supposed to be criticism, think again. 'Spirited Away' is every bit as incredible as the most incredible things written about it would have you believe. It simply transports you to a meticulously realised universe of spirits and mythology; a world utterly brimming over with fantastical sights and characters. The realisation of this whole mise-en-scene is a monumental cinematic achievement. You come out of the movie really feeling like you've just spent two hours in some incredible parallel universe.The attention to detail is staggering, the surprises endless (and I just mean every damn camera shot has something in it that will make your jaw drop to one extent or another), and somehow through this barrage of unheralded ideas the central character comes through rock solid, as do all of the supporting ones.That isn't to say that characterisation is the movie's long suite. Perhaps it's just a cultural thing, but it seems to me that even the best Japanimation doesn't _quite_ have the Disney capacity to make you fall in love with the characters. Or perhaps you could argue that Disney is just overly sentimental. In any event this is really the only very slight fault I could find with 'Spirited Away' - and it is slight, because there are scenes, particularly in the latter part of the film, which will bring a lump to your throat.One quibble: people keep saying how much better the animation is in this film than in Disney (well, Disney aren't even doing hand-drawn animation anymore, but you know what I mean.) I think they mean that the backgrounds and drawings are better. The animation - literally the movement from frame to frame of the characters - is not up to top notch Disney standards. Watch a car drive along the road in the early part of the film: it is conspicuously jerky, unlike the smooth panoramic, sweeping animation of Disney in the past decade. However, except in those very early scenes, it isn't very noticeable, and even if you did notice it, you would be so gobsmacked by the amazing, almost poetic backdrops in so many of the scenes that you'd soon forget about it.I guess I've picked a few holes in 'Spirited Away', haven't I?  That's why I'm only giving it a meagre 9.5 out of 10.0.  It's a masterpiece. See it.",10,8,13,19 June 2004
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," The first of the 'canonical' Miyazaki films.
","The first thing to establish is that this is a science fiction epic. It has more in common with 'Dune' or any number of SF novels - Brian Aldiss's 'Hothouse' springs to mind for one- than it does with a typical western animated children's film. Therefore one's expectations should be a little different, and ultimately it was the SF aspect which gave the movie such a high grade in my books. Whereas it didn't have quite the emotional clout that I look for in an animated feature, it was a stupendously told SF story.Technically not a Ghibli film (Miyazaki actually used the studio which did most of 'The Last Unicorn', and which more or less became Ghibli when 'Laputa' was made a couple of years later), 'Nausicaa' is a far-future SF story with a princess/warrior/nature-lover heroine and strong environmental themes. There's also an opposing princess/leader trying to use technology to overcome the apparently hostile environment. If you're starting to think 'Princess Mononoke', you'd be on the right track. In some ways 'Nausicaa' seems like an early stab in the direction of 'Mononoke', though the latter would delve far more into spirituality and mythology, eschewing the SF aspects.There aren't really any major weak points in Nausicaa - unless you count the frustrating 12 drawings per second animation which I constantly complain about in Japanese animation. The backgrounds aren't as amazing and the animation not as good as the last few Ghibli films, but for 1984 it was plenty good enough. I have a fairly trivial complaint in that the character of Kuratowa is drawn in a slightly more 'anime' style, ala Lupin III, whereas all of the other characters are done in a realistic style. He just seems a little out of place, though he's quite delightfully drawn.The really strong points of the movie are its pacing (at least until the very end. Miyazaki was unhappy with the end too), its story telling, which manages to be sophisticated without being impossibly complex, its engrossing background drawings and settings, - and most of all in the amazing attention to detail in the fully realized post-apocalypse SF-fantasy world in which the story is set. Every little thing is worked out and placed such that you find yourself admiring inventions, ideas, structures, creatures, etc which don't draw attention to themselves, but simply exist as part of the backdrop of the movie. Of course 'Nausicaa' had existed for several years as a serialised Manga, so Miyazaki no doubt knew its universe inside-out.There's a very clever plot, which I won't give away, but which involves humanity's relationship with the Earth and nature.It's the sort of movie which you can get thoroughly caught up in, and which will stand repeated viewings. It really is a film which is perfectly pitched at both a young and an adult audience. As Miyazaki's second feature film it is also, rightly or wrongly, usually considered the start of Studio Ghibli, and is arguably worth watching for historical reasons, too.Not the very best from Miyazaki or Ghibli, but an auspicious beginning.PS, in case you didn't know, there was a heavily butchered US version floating around called 'Warriors of the Wind', which is universally reviled as a disgrace. Just to make it confusing, some of the Japanese copies are also called 'Warriors of the Wind'. The thing to look for is the 116 minute running length. If you get that, you've got the right one. At the moment the only way you can get the film is in Japanese dialog with English subtitles. Personally I'd go ahead and do that, rather than wait while Disney squats on the US distribution rights (Amazon gives it a release date of 2010 for God's sake). You can always replace it later.Good stuff.",8,88,106,18 September 2004
Grave of the Fireflies," A masterpiece, whose beauty is often overlooked
","When I watched this movie, I steeled myself for a traumatic experience, based on every review I'd ever read of it, which usually include phrases like 'don't watch this if you're suicidal.' Instead, if I had to pick a single word to sum up the movie I saw, it would probably be 'beautiful'.Certainly it was sad, and arguably depressing, but I've read this movie compared with 'Saving Private Ryan'. That's ridiculous. 'Grave of the Fireflies' is gentle and poetic more often than it's violent, and it's remarkably restrained in its anti-war message. It simply tells a story : there's very little at all in the way of moralizing or polemics. Why would a story like this need such heavy-handed tactics?I've also read it argued that the movie is robbed of any suspense or impact when it's revealed in the opening scene that the main characters are dead. I have a quite different view of that device.Firstly. the beginning of 'Fireflies' is, for all intents and purposes, a 'happy ending'. This is such a non-linear plot development that you could fail to notice it, and thereby only see the movie's gloom. The moment where the ghostly Seita takes the ghostly Setsuko's hand and nods to her is not only a happy moment, it signifies that the suffering - which is yet to come, as far as the viewer is concerned - is over, and they are together again (albeit still without parents).As for a character revealing that he is dead in the first line of the movie, this is a device which has been used in centuries if not Milena. The crucial thing here is that 'Fireflies' isn't _about_ tension. It tells a story whose ultimate conclusion you already know (a legitimate narrative approach), and everything which happens during that story is emotionally infused with a foreknowledge of its ending. You find yourself hoping that things will go right now for Setsuko and Seita, and then the knowledge that ultimately it won't undercuts you with real emotional power. You know the characters are going to die, but you hope things won't be so bad in the meantime. It doesn't take much of an effort to make that an analogy for our own lives, which makes us all fireflies.Perhaps what might make someone feel disappointed or cheated by this film is simply that it's so damn honest. I mean that: it's one of the most honest, artifice-free movies I've ever seen. It doesn't even really try to ram an anti-war message down your throat there is very little overt violence, and if there are some scenes of corpses and suffering, it's never gratuitous, and it's over quickly. Compare this with 'Private Ryan', where you have to suffer through 40 minutes of the most horrific blood and guts, only to reach a conclusion which, after much blood and thunder, signifies very little.'Fireflies', OTOH, has far more beauty than gore. This is what really surprised me about it. Probably two thirds of the movie takes place in gorgeously drawn, tranquil rural or urban settings, with an almost pleasant dreamlike quality - even when the American bombers are flying overhead at one point there is a surreal, almost serene sense to it - and there are plenty of moments of happiness to offset the undeniably sadness and frustration of other scenes.Perhaps best of all, Setsuko is one of the very, very few (if not the only) animated 4 year-old I've ever seen who actually _behaves_ like a four year old. I'm so sick of seeing preternaturally smart, sassy, sophisticated and precocious children in Hollywood movies. Setsuko's emotion and behaviors are _exactly_ right for a completely normal four year-old, and recognizing this lends many scenes incredible poignancy. Similarly, Seita is a teenage boy who behaves with the sort of mixture of pride, compassion and hubris which you'd expect of someone his age. He still believes that Japan will win the war he thinks it's up to him to take care of his sister with their mother gone and father who knows where. This leads him to make mistakes: possibly the most obvious one being where he fails to take the farmer's advice, swallow his pride and ask his nasty aunt to take them back in again. You would probably have to say his decision not to even try - to go it alone instead, was a very bad one, but - hello, people - here is a character who makes mistakes because he's actually human: a believable teenage boy in an extraordinary situation, who doesn't miraculously save the day, because his best judgment just isn't good enough.Of course, his aunt may well have knocked them back anyway. Who knows?Don't go into the film expecting tension, drama or even a tirade against war. It's a movie about the beauty and fragility of life and youth. If you think Japanese animation is all giant robots and superhuman schoolgirls, this could be the film which changes your mind. It's slow, poetic, beautiful and sad, and extraordinarily honest.I must be the only person who didn't cry during this film (and I mean, I get choked up during some Disney movies). Yes, it is sad, but its beauty and honesty is what I'll remember.NB: this review refers to the subtitled version of the film.",10,554,576,4 September 2004
The Last Samurai," Disappointing
","You can't really fault Tom Cruise's performance: once again he reveals that he can be more than adequate without being stellar. It's more the film as a whole; it's general lack of emotional impact.Cruise plays a frontier hero of the American-Indian 'wars', cynical and filled with self-loathing over his part in the atrocities. A large salary lures him to Japan to modernise and train the Emperor's army, and to fight off an insurgent Samurai and his peasant army, who refuse to use firearms.The most obvious parallel that springs to mind is 'Dances With Wolves', but 'Last Samurai' has little of the emotional clout of 'Wolves'. Instead it seems a transparent white liberal attempt to redeem the country from American Indian holocaust by personifying the nation in  Cruise's character. This may have worked if the film hadn't been so inexplicably flat and dull. It makes gestures at poignancy and intensity, but they fall curiously flat, and for much of the time it's simply too slow.Not a bad movie, but falls short of its own goals.  6 out of 10.",6,1,2,21 June 2004
Castle in the Sky," Impressive, but not a masterpiece
","The first of the official Ghibli films, Laputa is most similar to its predecessor Nausicaa, but whereas Nausicaa was a SF epic, this is more of an action comedy-adventure with a fairly weak SF premise.For the first half hour of the movie I thought I was going to love it. Once again you find yourself in awe of Miyazaki's attention to detail, and his ability to conjure up an imaginary world in meticulous, beautiful perfection. The animation, though still not in the league of the later Ghibli films, is a little better than in Nausicaa.I mentioned in my review of Nausicaa that one character is drawn in a more 'Lupinesque' anime style. Here there are a whole bunch of them: the pirates. They provide the comic element in the film, though quite why it needs a comic element I'm not sure. There was nothing funny about Nausicaa, and I think it was better off for it. Still. having said that, Dola, the pirate leader, is easily the most memorable character in the film (even if she's basically a female Long John Silver. Don't be surprised if you're reminded of 'Treasure Planet' at times) and is well voiced by Cloris Leachman in the American dub.The English voice cast acquit themselves well for the most part, actually. However something started going pear-shaped for me about this movie by about the halfway mark. I think the best way that I could describe it is that the characters get swallowed up by the vast scope of the story. I'll come back to that later.There is so much to admire about Laputa, and so many people obviously love it, that I almost feel mean for only giving it 8 out of 10, but for me the operative word here is 'admire'. It was more impressive than personally affecting, and at over two hours it just started to drag.The crucial thing for me was this: I really found that I didn't care much about any of the characters. Disney would have taken the care to develop the characters, make you really fall for them, rather than leave them as relatively two-dimensional pieces to be moved around while you gawked at the amazing vistas in the movie. Even that would have been tolerable if there was some hard SF in the story to make up for it, but it was basically a lot of gobledegook about Princesses and magic crystals. That's where Laputa falls down as far as I'm concerned, and that's what holds it back from being a potential 10 out of 10 movie. Having said that, it must be admitted that Miyazaki was leagues ahead of Disney in general in 1986, when you consider that their movie of the same year was the pretty dire 'Great Mouse Detective'.Laputa is a good film in some ways an amazing film, and you should definitely see it, but I do feel it's over-rated. I definitely prefer the earlier 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind'.BTW, if you manage to watch them in chronological order, watch for the fox-squirrel from Nausicaa popping up briefly in Laputa.",8,6,11,20 September 2004
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Real improvement on the first movie
","Well, I was quite pleasantly surprised with Harry Potter II. Like LOTR, I thought the first movie got off to a visually terrific start, but then got progressively bogged down for one reason or another.To an extent 'Chamber of Secrets' suffers from the same problem, but in this case the first half hour isn't just visually terrific, it's absolutely amazing. The fantasy vision just completely enshrouds you. After that it does suffer a bit from the same problem as its parent: i.e. once they get to the school, you find that without amazing, panoramic things to look at, the story tends to grind on a little (it's a 155 minute movie, after all). However this fault was less bothersome than the first time around, and there is hardly a scene which doesn't contain something unexpectedly delightful (or horrible).That's one thing that impressed me about Potter II: whereas George Lucas would just fill his second trilogy of Star Wars movies with a plethora of fantastic, whizzing objects, and hope that their cumulative effect would be to daze you into not noticing how boring the film actually is - Columbus deploys all his little cameo monsters, gadgets, objects and scenery with some loving care. The result is that you don't just get gratuitous weird things; you get pleasing weird things which look like they belong where they're filmed, rather than shoved in your face to amaze you.Though it's quite a while since I saw the original, it seemed to me there was a more adult tone to this film. Certainly there was at least one fairly substantial sequence which was skin-crawling enough to provoke a response in the average adult.The casting is just superb - again, Columbus employs people who not only can act, but are perfectly suited to their roles, whereas Lucas relegates his few good actors to bit parts and fills his lead roles with people who would barely cut it on 'The Young and the Restless'.A really impressive film that gets a solid 8.0 from me (the original got 6.0)",8,0,1,8 August 2004
Any Given Sunday," Oliver Stone finally loses it altogether
","Up until now, Oliver Stone was the film-maker I hated to love. He could be annoying, polemic, and distractingly 'filmic' for no reason.  I think the perfect example of this hate-love relationship for me was 'JFK', which was basically an annoying, opinionated recreation of 'history' presented as fact, but which had enough narrative drive, great characters and generally good film-making and excitement to be really enjoyable anyway.On any Given Sunday is the movie where, for me, the style runs away with the substance. Changing the film stock; going from an overexposed scene to a grainy scene, suddenly changing the camera angles, moving the camera around for no apparent reason, cutting to insert shots of unrelated material, having the camera show the listener rather than the speaker - these are all techniques which have their place, and which, on the whole cause the viewer to be distracted from the narrative and more aware of the fact that they are watching a construction. Unless used carefully, they interfere with the suspension of disbelief.Now, Stone will use all of these techniques in the same scene, and it will be a scene where two people are standing in a room arguing about football.I'm sorry, but WHAT'S THE POINT?If it's not enough that a simple scene looks like it was shot by four different directors and film crews, all of whom were drunk, we have to have these absurd cuts to scenes from the chariot race from 'Ben-Hur'. 
Stone has the virtue of being one of a dying breed which I suppose you could call auteurs. Movies like this make me wish he could just tell a damn story properly.",Null,0,1,8 March 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Tasmania
","To be honest, this is less a review than a complaint about film sound and the dynamic range of modern movies. Alright, I have hearing problems, but I can watch a movie made before about 2000, usually without too much trouble. However the increasing obsession with soundtracks which swing between whispered dialog and thunderous sound effects is driving me to distraction. After about an hour of straining to hear about one word in ten of the dialog, and replaying sections to try to make them out - only to recoil from the set when the volume jumps 30db when someone closes a door or drops something in a pond - I just gave up and rewound the damn thing.  And this is just with the VHS version. God knows what the dynamic range on the DVD is like. My parents have the same problem with most new films.Please, film people, try to grasp this basic fact: unless the scene is taking place in a hurricane, the wind should not be louder than the actor's voice. And lip-reading won't even work. Have you tried to lip read Gollum?Ok, I will include something by way of review, and since I never reviewed part two of the trilogy, I'll let this count for the whole epic.I did watch parts one and two all the way through, and at least _some_ of part three, and the more I saw of it, the more I wanted to go out, scruff all the LOTR fans by the neck and tell them to just READ THE DAMN BOOK.I am not some sort of Tolkien purist. I haven't even read the book myself in about 20 years, but I do have images graven in my memory from when I did. Furthermore, they are MY images, conjured by a combination of Tolkien's imagination and my own. LOTR is a superb fantasy epic, and deserves to be read, so that it might spark images in your mind which belong to you. As it is, we have a generation of people wandering around with Peter Jackson's images of LOTR in their heads. This is true of any adaptation of course, but with something as intensely fantastical and visual as LOTR, I think that people who have read, loved and internalised the book would do well to steer clear of the movies. I might just read the book again instead. At least all the words are the same height.",Null,2,4,3 June 2004
The Bourne Supremacy," Very weak. A major disappointment
","I'm amazed that this film rates so well here. The re-make of 'The Bourne Identity' (which I actually only watched for the first time two days before this movie) was a decent thriller. This was a hopelessly weak, half-hearted, over-stylised and predictable bore of a movie.The signs were there early on, when Jason reacts to a traumatic event with barely any emotion (nor at any time later in the movie). Events happen rapidly and confusingly, a blonde woman who talks very quickly is assigned to the case by the CIA, Bourne runs about the place using different passports, there are car chases. There is more editing in this film than in an Oliver Stone film on picture search. Honestly, there are fight sequences in which the shot changes so fast, so often, that you can't even work out who is hitting who. I actually sat down at one action sequence in the film and tried to time a camera shot that lasted for more than a second, and failed. This pointless stylisation is just really irritating and makes things difficult to follow.More importantly though the movie just has no feeling. You can understand why Bourne would be motivated to behave the way he does, but he doesn't actually seem to be experiencing any such feelings, except the usual confusion and determined anger left over from the first film.Honestly I just thought this was a weak, weak film. It didn't engage me emotionally, there was too much frivolous editing, the characters and plot were predictable, despite the best efforts of the director to render the plot hard to follow. It was just very obviously a case of 'Well the first film made a lot of money, we'll have to make a sequel.' If the ratings here are any judge, I suppose they'll have to make another one, but I can tell you now I'll be staying away from that.",3,3,6,7 February 2005
