The Hangover," My Favorite Movie of the Summer
","The Hangover is summer's best film! I won't go into details about the funny parts because if you are one of the few people who still haven't seen it, words just won't do this film justice. I will, however, give kudos to those involved in making this movie.Primarily, the film works as a result of a brilliant narrative device: we are just as clueless as the characters are about what happened the night before. As the film progresses, we are given one shocking revelation after another, each building to high comedy. The momentum is almost non-stop! A lot of the humor is also generated from the corky characters and how they react to each shocking development. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis all turn in brilliant performances and stay in character rather than just acting goofy. The fact that they all seem so believable makes the chaos that they face all the more hysterical.Laughter is valuable to your health and it is hard to produce an effective comedy these days. Anyone who needs to laugh is well served by seeing this movie; even if you don't need a laugh: see this movie!!",10,3,6,2 September 2009
Orphan," The Best Horror Movie I've Seen in a Long Time
","'Orphan' is a great horror movie! It is made all the more effective in the fact that the characters are three dimensional and complex. This is one of the few recent movies where I was more interested in the characters than the action on screen.It would have been easy to have had the evil orphan, Esther, move into the perfect family and disrupt their harmony, but the family in this film has such dysfunction that the destruction caused by her is more dramatic. The horror of the situation is made all the more palpable because you care about the family members, especially the mother, who has lost a great deal of reliability as a result of her alcoholism. This also makes the scenes where she can't get anyone to believe her about Esther's true nature more authentic as opposed to being a plot device.The movie also has a plot twist that would seem implausible, but, because the film-makers have kept you sold on the reality of the situation, you buy it. In light of what I call the 'Sixth Sense' phenomenon, I usually roll my eyes when a film does a plot twist that changes the entire context of the story. This time, however, it's like a kick in the gut! The final 20 minutes of this movie are so intense that audience I saw it with got very vocal in response to what they were seeing on the screen. In addition to that, Esther is such a malevolent force of nature that the entire audience clapped when she finally got her comeuppance. My advice: see this movie with someone you can grab onto during the many moments of suspense!",10,2,3,1 September 2009
Shrek Forever After," Shrek goes out on a low note:(
","It's sad to watch a fall from greatness and that's what can best be described for the 'Shrek' films. The series started out strong with the first two movies and began to stumble into routine with the third. Now all the novelty and energy is gone and with 'Shrek Ever After' the audience gets a predictable, by-the-numbers, formula movie.I think the main problem has to do with the fact that Shrek, Donkey, Fiona and Puss have lost all of the chemistry that made the earlier movies fun. The comfort in their interactions drains all of the opening scenes of life. The main crisis in this film is also a little weak: Shrek has grown tired of his life as a celebrity ogre (this plot point is handled awkwardly in the opening scenes) and makes a deal with Rumplestilskin to go back to when he was feared by others. You know the movie's in trouble when this 'It's a Wonderful Life' scenario is inserted to try to breathe some novelty into Shrek's story.This wouldn't be a problem if the movie had fun with this situation. Sadly, it focuses more on action scenes to show off the 3-D effects rather than focusing on the alternate realities of the characters. There is an extended scene of Shrek flying a witches broom to escape from Rumplestilskin's castle, which is cool, but really exist for no other purpose than to give the audience a roller-coaster simulation. The same can be said for a drawn out flying dragon scene in the beginning of the film as well.This movie also has less of the pop culture references that made the other films in the series enjoyable for adults as well as kids. The first film, in particular, seemed to be taking a lot of jabs at Disney, now it seems like Dreamworks is less hostile towards their competitors. Ultimately, The film wastes opportunities to have fun not just with the series regulars but also with the new characters: the Pied Piper, Rumplestilskin, the witches and all the other ogres. This was disappointing way to say goodbye to Shrek:(",4,72,142,23 May 2010
Into the Wild," Lessons from 'the Bus'
","I had been familiar with this story for awhile, but had never set time aside to read the book or see the movie. This week, however, the library was promoting novels about nature and I took the opportunity to pick up the book. I read it in one sitting. It was that type of book; one that touches you on an emotional level and makes you forget all of your surroundings. Tonight I watched the movie.I've read some of the criticisms of Chris and I agree with many of them: yes, he did not know nearly enough about the wilderness to go on his endeavor and he would not have met his end had he heeded any of the advice of people more knowledgeable about Alaska. But what intrigued me about his story was not the 'how' of the adventure, but the 'why'.The motive to escape his synthetic family is more apparent in the movie than in the book, but I think he would have still gone on this odyssey regardless of his damaged home life. He just could not handle the responsibility that went with the attachment to other human beings. You see that in all of the people he meets while on the road. He packs up and leaves whenever it gets too emotionally intimate. The saddest example of this is when Ron asks to 'adopt' him and Chris dodges his request. His reaction inevitably seals his fate.His story would not have been possible to tell if it weren't for the people that he met on the road putting the pieces of his two year sabbatical together. For all these people to remember him so vividly and embrace him, he must have had some special qualities. It's tragic, however, that he denied all of these people from relating to him. He would only have his outlook on life shaped by authors such as Tolstoy and London. I think the lesson to take from his story is that although we may all want to shun the world we live in, we cannot prevent ourselves from connecting to other people. If we do we all end up trapped on some form of the same bus that was Chris' coffin.You will notice that I haven't said anything about the aesthetics of the film. For me to focus solely on the emotions that the movie produced and filter out all its technical qualities should give you a clue as to how well this film is made.",10,1,3,20 March 2010
