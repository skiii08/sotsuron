Ford v Ferrari," Exciting races with great performances and touching moments
","Ford v Ferrari (AKA Le Mans 66 in some European countries) is a story based on the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari in the 60s. It's a sport biopic of sorts with the characters of Ken Miles played by Christian Bale and Carolle Shelby played by Matt Damon of course being real individuals. The story of course exaggerates lots of things for the sake of dramatisation even more than other films so it isn't necessary a typical biopic. The film is directed by James Mangold who directed the masterful film 'Logan' but the film certainly feels drastically different from Logan. Still, I came in with high expectations because James Mangold directed it and plus all the oscar buzz around the film.Firstly, the story is very compelling and engaging for a film about racing cars. The human drama between the Ford executives and the main characters is very natural albeit cliche. However, the director manages to balance out the racing with the human drama naturally so that none become too overwhelming or boring. Despite being titled 'Ford v Ferrari' the film is more about the clash of Miles and Shelby against the meddling executives. The heart and passion of Miles/Shelby with the cold and calculative business choices of the executives is really the heart and soul of the film with some added bonus of intense racing. There are a lot of poignant and genuinely heart warming touching moments but with some funny moments and that is not normal for these type of films. Secondly, Both Christian Bale and Matt Damon give great performances with strong chemistry between the two that makes the friendship more believable. The supporting cast Jon Berthal, Caitriona Balfe,Tracy Letts give good performances as well and definitely do well in making the world more alive. Special mention to Josh Lucas who I say is the REAL antagonist of this film by somehow being suave but absolutely detestable. Thirdly, the race scenes are incredibly done and intense with great wide shots and none of the shaky camera garbage. The film really excels at creating exciting and thrilling auto action which is in part thanks to excellent score by Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders. The score captures the electrifying race scenes but also uses score and music from the 60s to elevate the era the film is set in.Likewise, the sound and sound editing in this film are done perfectly as I could feel the engine turning or when the gears change. It's just really good.I do have some issues with this film and the first is the amount of cliches used by this film. The monologue at the beginning being used at the end again, Ken Miles being the typical cliche underdog character from a sports film, the montage with the amount of failures, the main character knowing more than the experts and machines etc. The cliches are done masterfully but it did surprise me a lot about how many cliches were in this film. My other minor issue has got to be the run time which is at 152 minutes. The pacing of this movie is mostly fine but there are certain points in this movie after they build the car where it just kind of drags. These are mostly in the scenes where there are paperwork or meetings where it just feels a bit too long for no reason.Other than some minor nitpicks, the movie is almost near perfect. The film is carried by great performances with thrilling car scenes but some genuinely touching and funny moments. The movie drives you along a road of contrasting emotions that leads you to an exciting finishing line. Give this film a watch.",9,1,4,14 March 2020
Knives Out," Flipping the Whodunit genre on its head
","Knives out is advertised as a whodunit movie. In a way it sort of is but this is Rian Johnson, he loves subverting expectations. Seriously though, this movie really subverts a lot of expectations. It's better to go into this movie with little to no knowledge which is why it is difficult to review this without giving away too much.First off, this movie has an amazing cast with Daniel Craig pulling off an American accent as the private investigator. Chris Evans post Avengers work has him play a much more terrible character which is a huge contrast to Captain America. Christopher Plummer while a minor role gives a very lovable mystery novelist. Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson and Toni Colette give a very convincing performance as egotistic rich snobs. Ana de Armas must be praised as well for being able to convincing give the audience a sort of POV character in this massive all star cast. I will also give props to Lakeith Stanfield, Katherine Langford, Jaeden Martell and Noah Segan as well as they did a great job as well. The story and the screenplay is just phenomenal with the witty and charming dialogue. Likewise, the twist are smart and really keep the audience on its toes.I do struggle to find negatives but I guess the one and only true blatant negative is the very obvious political message. 'Right white conservative' are bad. The movie doesn't emphasise it a lot but there are scenes where is delves into these such as immigration and having the white rich characters talk quite negatively about it. Likewise emphasising how the children of Christopher Plummer's character have not earned anything of their own legitimately or have been given massive money to earn anything. It's a very simple and obvious message that anyone can see throughout the entire film. Additionally, maybe the misleading advertisement can be quite a deterrent to some viewers. As stated at the beginning, Rian Johnson completely flips the Whodunit genre on its head but the trailers and advertisement suggest it is just a typical whodunit story when it really isn't. To me this isn't exactly a negative but it could be seen as such to other viewers.In conclusion, this is a must watch to everyone. It is such an entertaining movie and is a great reminded of films from the old Hitchcock days. While the director's previous work, The Last Jedi, was divisive; This movie is amazing. Give it a watch!",9,1,4,22 February 2020

Independence Day," They'll never let you fly the Space Shuttle if you marry a stripper
","The 4th of July is almost upon and what movie is fitting for Independence Day? Of course, the movie 'Independence Day' by Roland Emmerich. The premise is simple, aliens have come and attacked Earth on the 4th of July and the planet but mostly America has got to stop them. I've watched this movie years ago so rewatching it will be a very interesting experience.One thing I've remembered while starting this movie is how amazing and tension-filled that intro is. The scene with mankind's footprint on the moon getting blown away by the alien ship and the people on earth panicking about the ship in the sky is good stuff.My biggest praise for this movie has got to be the visual effects though which still look great even today. I think everyone remembers it since it was all in the marketing but the iconic white house getting blown up by the alien ship is just phenomenal honestly. Looking at how the movie was made and finding out that they built a miniature white house and blown it up which is cool. All the action scenes in this movie are just very thrilling and exciting to watch with its fast-paced air battles and spectacular explosions. The first act with the alien destruction and the final third act with the war is just so good! The movie contains a lot of comedic moments especially from Will Smith and they all gave me a slight chuckle and work in the movie's favour.Speaking of Will Smith, this and Bad Boys are the movies that practically launched his career to action fame and watching this movie again I can see why. Will Smith is extremely charming, funny and awesome as 'Captain Steven Hiller'. He punched an alien in the face while giving a cheesy one-liner, what more could you ask for? Jeff Goldblum is also likeable as the tech expert 'David Levinson' and Bill Pullman is charismatic as the American President 'Thomas J. Whitmore' and gives one of the most memorable speeches in movie history. The supporting cast is also great in their variety of different performances from the weird to the serious and they all do a great job.The negatives of this movie are very clear and it is that the plot is just very thin and bland. However, this is kind of expected since the movie is just an alien invasion but the movie runs for 145 minutes which is LONG. So the director does a lot of padding which ruins the pacing of this movie. This is especially noticeable in the second act where it feels like everything is slowing down and coming to a halt just so they can find a way to bring all the characters together and it just drags. Additionally, the movie has to find a way for humans to fight back and win but it is not very convincing. You are required to ignore questioning the logic of the plot and characters and dialling down the sense of believability for this movies plot to work.While I did praise the actors for their performance, the characters themselves are very lacking in depth. I don't feel like I understand any of the characters motives or backstory and none of the main characters changes by the end of the movie either. I never really cared for any of the characters dying and there are moments I've feel where they want you the audience to feel something but it doesn't work because none of the characters is that interesting for us to care. Well except for the dog who is a character we all care for and has a great moment in the movie. Rewatching the movie I've noticed how stereotypical the characters were which is probably why this movie was a product of the 90s and wouldn't be allowed today necessarily.Overall, the movie is still a fun movie to watch and even to rewatch. The true main star of this movie is the visual effects with its stunning action pyrotechnics giving us some of the best destruction in movie history. The production and set design are great and the amount of practical stuff is astounding as well. However, the movie is pretty cheesy and dumb with a very stupid conclusion which I've still find dumb even during my rewatch. One line still sticks to mind is 'they'll never let you fly the Space Shuttle if you marry a stripper' and honestly I still think about that because it shouldn't affect ones flying ability but apparently that is important. Nevertheless, this movie is just pure spectacle filled fun and no doubt watching this movie was an enjoyable time which is all that matters in over the top, cliche movies like these.",7,2,2,4 July 2020
1917," Film making in its glory
","People call this film 'The Birdman of WWI' and to be fair that is a justified assessment. This entire film is filmed like it is one camera shot and it is AWESOME! think one of the most impressive thing apart from the one looking shot is the AMAZING CINEMATOGRAPHY. This shouldn't be no surprising since it is the legend himself Roger Deakins (Blade Runner 2049 Cinematographer). Every scene feels like a painting and it is absolutely stunning. There is a scene at night where the lighting was done in such a creative way that heighten the tension of the scene. On that note there must also be praise for the score by Thomas Newman who somehow manages to make a score that somehow manages toe elevate every scene and help tell the story. There is also some amazing sound design that manages to make the War actually scary with moments that give horror movie jump scares a run for its money. Additionally, the props and set design should also get praise for creating such large,realistic but elaborate sets to accommodate for a more natural one shot scene. Everything in this film just feels like a technical achievement. We haven't even touched on the acting or story yet but just for the way this was filmed is already engaging enough. Nevertheless, the two main actors George MacKay as Lance Corporal William 'Will' Schofield and Dean-Charles Chapma as Lance Corporal Thomas 'Tom' Blake manages to do a phenomenal job in showing the horror of war and giving authentic,believable characters. The story, while relatively simple, is engaging enough to keep you invested in the objective of the main characters. They must send a message to allies stop them running into a trap. It's simple but works well for the aim of one shot as now it makes the audience a part of the journey.There isn't much negative to this movie but I guess if I have to be quite nitpicky it is the fact that halfway through the movie there is a obvious cut. So this movie is actually really a two shot film. The cut was necessary to make the situation more desperate and allow for a unique change in scenery even though it was a bit of a jarring cut. Another sort of nitpick is that we don't really get much info on the main characters. We get their names and we know what their mission is but their backstory is just given in tidbits. It goes in a Dunkirk route in which we care about these characters because of the situation they are in rather than the fact that we are invested in the characters. It can be argued that the tidbits more than gives you enough info about the characters but it's really up to the audience in the end. Personally, I don't find it too much of a fault but can see how others could consider it so.Honestly my negatives are just nitpicks. This movie is amazing and it is definitely worth watching right now.",9,1,1,29 February 2020

Parasite," Masterful film making
","I don't what to say about this film apart from how this film is masterful film making. I don't even want to give a synopsis for this film as this film is best experienced with no knowledge whatsoever.The plot is amazing and extremely gripping with every twist and turn. Likewise, the way it tackles the social themes is so intriguing and done so extremely well even if the theme has been done many times before. The entire cast is amazing and honestly not even one of them getting a nomination for best acting is quite the robbery. Huge praise to Song Kang-ho and Park So-dam especially, they gave amazing performances. The cinematography/set design is also impressive and uniquely correlates with the ongoing story. The use of staircase and lines to tackle the ongoing theme, while not subtle, is done extremely well. The soundtrack, while not exactly memorable, manages to elevate the tense atmosphere and keep people on the edge of their seats. Finally, the film is absolutely entertaining with the way it incorporates contrasting genres, black comedy and thriller, into one surprisingly cohesive and exhilarating movie.THIS IS A MUST WATCH! It deserves best picture for a reason.",10,3,5,23 February 2020
