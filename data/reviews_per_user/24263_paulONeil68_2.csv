","Biggest load of rubbish that I have ever watched.Believe me I get the plot. But with.You just sit waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting.
Poor Gabrel Byrne having to lower his standards to star in this film.

3.3 absolutely rubbishDo not waste your life on this movie",2,1,7,21 June 2020
Joker," WOW
","Well this was brilliantly done,what can i say the movie is such a tragic story that as you mind blown away in the finals minutes of the end. the sadness of one human life so tragically intense but yet so psychotic
very well put together and very well acted.This leaves you wonder by the end how much of that was in his mind and how much was real.over the last decade DC and Marvel have had too many pretty boys to play pretty parts and had way to much CGI and Photoshopwhat we have here was a raw character played and played without any facades
#JoaquinPhoenix did this movie justice he created something bigger than the writer ever anticipated , now he has raised the bar they need ( the writers) to deliver the sequel",10,4,6,12 January 2020
