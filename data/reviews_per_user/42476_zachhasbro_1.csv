Skyfall," Count To Ten
","This film is ambitious. The more I think about it the more I appreciate the real, raw emotion that was captured on screen and thrust at the audience. I don't believe any other Bond film has ever had the ability to do this; the campy, guns blazing, invincible Bond is not what a real-life Bond would be. My opinion the best opening/credit sequence of the series. One of the best Bond villains. The acting and directing couldn't be better.In terms of the tone of the James Bond series, there was only meant to be one Skyfall. And it's done brilliantly. Now that Craig is signed for two more Bonds he needs to save the world, and dare I say venture into space?",10,5,15,10 November 2012
