It," Not a scarier horror than most, but a better film than most horrors.
","This remake wasn't probably the scariest of horror films I have ever seen, despite being petrified of clowns (I saw the original with Tim Curry when I was 4 years old), but it held up very well as a film. The characters had a certain integrity, the ignorance of adults in the movie capture the eerie hive-mind ignorance of the town of Derry in the book. This is what I imagined it to be like, when I read the book. It was also a good call to focus just on the children's story, and leave out the 27 years later, that is intertwined in the storytelling in the original. It makes it easier to track, and helps focus on the story. And leaves them an option to do It 2 when and if they want to. Having the kid from Stranger Things play Richie Tozier was also a nice touch. You can also find references to Tim Curry in the clown room. Not a scarier horror than most, but a better film than most horrors.",9,4,11,9 September 2017
