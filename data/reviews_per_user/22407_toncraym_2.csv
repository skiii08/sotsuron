Hereditary," Mind blown
",Holy smokes. That movie scared me and everyone else in the theatre. I've never seen a movie where everyone in the theatre literally screamed. Yes. I said screamed.The movie has that classic build up of good old fashioned horror movies but the end makes you leave the theatre asking yourself what did I just watch?!? Think ending of sleepaway camp surprise without the crossdressing. It's that kind of surprise.I really want to see this movie again knowing what I know and look for more things.,8,0,2,24 March 2019
Us," It was meh.
","I was SO excited about this movie!Movie started and its visually pretty. I'm waiting for the scary part to start. Still waiting. Half way through...still waiting. Movie ends and I get it, I paid to see a movie that was SUPER overhyped. That was the scary part.The movie had way too many plot holes and way too many times you went 'but why?!?!?' to make it the 10 out of 10 that people are giving it.Trust me people. Let it come to redbox or on demand to get it. Save your money and allow yourself to watch it where you can take bathroom breaks. You wont miss anything.",5,1,3,23 March 2019
