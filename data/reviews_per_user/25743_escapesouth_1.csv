The Avengers," I guess i am too old
","I saw this movie without any expectations, the trailer did not entice me at all but took my 11 year old and 16 year old son, of course I saw the high ratings from IMDb and thought OK I got to go see it.My first impression was totally predictable, second not at all impressed with the 3 d effects so, I guess I have to sum it up to either At the age of 46 I am way to old old. But then again I was not a big transformers fan.Everyone said this movie was really funny OK was it the dry homor or the hulk slapping Thor, in any case did not fall off my seat laughing. The rest of the story line was kind of mondane but. I guess this is what people today are looking for in a film.",6,6,15,15 May 2012
