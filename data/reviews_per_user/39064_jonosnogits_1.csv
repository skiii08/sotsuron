Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 6 years after i first saw it
","I had the opportunity to view this film again 6 years after i first saw it. Resting assured i had forgotten about all the hype & expectations surrounding its' initial release in 1999, i felt confident i could enjoy this film if i wanted to completely unbiased.It seems incredible though how almost all the actors performances suffer virtually the exact same short comings, very flat & one dimensional. I guess a drab forgetful script doesn't help but it also seemed like they've all been told by George L. 'if any one of you try anything clever- I'll see your career is finished!'.I'm sure this was not the case though.Understandabley Lucas had a fresh new young generation to impress but sadly it still seems too childish. The super bike race sequence with Anikin goes on too long and is over produced. i personally find too demanding on my eyeballs.The film probably suffers too much conscious control and not enough naive passion from all involved. Some parts of the film don't really seem to make any believable sense, they're just there to set up the next scene (which is then an anti climax). It all felt a bit like going through the motions for me.I struggled to get charged up by any of the characters and perceive any real depth to any scenes in the film. The JaJa Binks character ends up being quite meaningless & irritating after a while especially when none of the characters really relate to him. (probably because they were really talking to a blue screen.)Don't get me wrong it's certainly an easy watchable film but second time round reminds me why i forgot it the first time.",4,0,1,6 July 2007
