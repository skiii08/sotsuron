The Equalizer," Denzel y u do this?
","The summary says it all, he killed more people than Rambo with more 'gadgets' than MacGruber. This is the kind of a bad move i wish he got a lot of money for because it is not very good, and is one of those what did i waste my time on? Plot: Retired mystery man with great skills who stooped doing dirty stuff because a promise to his dead wife goes against the whole Russian mafia for a prostitute (with a good voice witch we never hear) he hangs around with when she gets beaten by her pimp.To sum it up: Do people really think one man can kill the entire Russian mafia and a few petty criminals along the way with house whole appliances/chemicals. The only reason i gave it 4 stars and why this movie is different than low budget TV movies is because of the actors and their performances.",4,18,37,15 December 2014
