The Avengers," Nothing different.
","Honestly, I would give this movie 4 or 5 stars. The 1 star I gave is only to average out all the 10 stars it got earlier. Avengers is no different from other superhero movies. There are a bunch of people with superpowers, there is a villain who wants to destroy the planet(He starts with the United States. All evil powers that plan to destroy the planet begins with the United States. And most of the damage is done only to a portion of New York), and all the superpowers combined, defeat the villain. Required amount of drama, humor, etc are placed as necessary. Nothing more. Somehow, everyone loves this? Good reason to believe that paid reviews can affect the overall rating to a good extent.",1,9,34,19 August 2014
