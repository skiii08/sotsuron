The New World," save the best for last
","The first quarter of an hour was bearable, the next hour and a hour - well patience is a virtue, patience that was well rewarded in the last half hour with a, as usual, excellent performance by Christian Bale. Normally preferring action to mush (nothing like a good rugby game!!!), an emotional roller-coaster - from happiness for John Rolfe as the woman he truly loved finally returned his to absolute adoration and then dissolving into an unusual flood of tears as his love dies, but then at least some hope as she leaves him with their son, with who he returns 'home'. Enduring 1 and three quarter hours of Colin Farrell was worth it for the last half hour of Christian Bale - half a fabulously and well done hour.",8,2,5,9 June 2006
