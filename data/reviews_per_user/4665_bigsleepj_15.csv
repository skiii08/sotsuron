Vertigo," The Creepiest Movie Ever made...
","VERTIGO is one of my favourite Hitchcock movies, but not because I find it to be a beautiful love story, but because it makes you think. And because the 3rd Act (so to speak) is the creepiest thing I ever saw.
(Spoiler starts here) James Stewart Making Kim Novak look like his dead girlfriend is the creepiest, sickening thought imaginable. Makes my stomach turn and makes my skin crawl. A friend said 'how sick is this guy' when he watched it, yet he liked the movie in the end. (Spoiler ends here).This movie is haunting, and Scotty Ferguson is a person worth pittying. I can't help but feel a huge burden of sorrow whenever I watch this romantic thriller.But one complaint. (Spoiler starts here). The ending is unsatifying. I know this movie can't have a happy ending and I can't imagine James Stewart and Kim Novak walking down the stairs with a 'The End' and romantic music playing. If they could have found another way to end this that doesn't seem so forced then I would have had a better sad ending.(Spoiler ends here).For anyone who loves a good art-house movie, Vertigo is for you. One of Hitchcock's best.",Null,1,2,11 September 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," Get a Life!
",I like Shrek. Other people like Shrek too. But to compare Monsters Inc with Shrek shows you have no life! Both are computer generated. Other than than they have nothing even remotely in common.Just stop comparing every other movie with Shrek. Just enjoy monsters Inc. will ya! If you got to compare everthing to something else you're never going to end up anywhere in life.Yes. Monsters Inc is no Shrek. But it is something special. Maybe it's even better than Shrek! Get a life! Stop living in the past! Go see each new movie on its own merits and maybe you'll get through life happy.,10,1,2,5 November 2001
"Monsters, Inc."," Stabs of Joy.
","I have commented on this before, but I would like to ad that I really enjoyed this movie! It knocked me over, left me breathless, gave me what author/ critic/ scholar/ philosopher/ spiritualist CS Lewis calls a stab of Joy. It is that feeling of pure, unperverse warmth (not to confused with pleasure which can get guilty) that errupts something takes your fancy. Not that I can describe it half as good as that fellow. I think MONSTER'S INC is one of the best movies ever made. Best animated movie, though. Should have taken the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, but Shrek is good enough to get away with it. Unlike Shrek, which is silly yet deep(I own it on DVD, so don't complain), Monster's Inc builds more on character developement and scenario than pop-culture references (it has a few, though).This movie took me away into the World of Monstropolis. I was practically one of the characters (I have two eyes, in case you were wondering).I just can't understand how anyone could NOT like this movie. A work of art!",10,0,1,7 August 2002
Fargo," Best Score ever!!
","The Coen Brother's Fargo is somewhat of a classic, depending on the viewer. For the last five years people have been loving or hating this movie for their own reasons.Some people like it because it's gory and bloody. Some people like it because it's funny. Some people like it because it's a complex human tragedy-comedy of terrifying proportions, filled with greed, evil and decay of morals.Yes, all this makes a good movie. But what makes this such an outstanding movie is Carter Burwell's haunting music. Other reviewers on this site have omitted this, so I'm going to discuss it's effectiveness.Movie scores are a complex business. You get movies that has beautiful music, but it doesn't compliment it in any way. Some music try to be too complex, like John William's score for the Phantom Menace. Despite the main theme and 'Duel of the Fates' parts most of the soundtrack is like ill conceived ballet music.Burwell's theme is slow and simple, like the Fargo itself. When the 'This is a True Story' line appears you hear a solitary instrument bringing forth the tune. Then by the time they actually show the title of the movie, a full orchestra joined in. This theme explores the tragedy of 'Fargo' and all who lives in the Coen's vision of the Northern USA.The orchestral part of Fargo's Soundtrack is the best ever created for a movie. Ranks right up there with Forest Gump, Braveheart, Titanic and the Original Star Wars!Fargo would have just been another independent film with a good story if it hadn't been for this great soundtrack which made this film a classic. I think there are a lot of Hollywood A-list directors crying in darkly-lit recording rooms wishing they had Fargo's main theme for their movie.Who knows? Maybe 'Freddy got Fingered' might have won Best Picture if it had this score.",Null,0,1,21 August 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," There seems to be 2 problems that makes this movie away from perfect
","(Slight spoilers) Ah, yes. The perfect movie. Is there such a thing?No! Even CITIZEN KANE has it's flaws! There's a pterodactyl in KANE, for crying out loud.The main problem with THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING the beefing up of the role of Arwen, played by Liv Tyler. She is only slightly mentioned in the book, but now she is Xena's more-covered Elven Clone! And she talks as if she has learned to live with something stuck in her throat! One of my friends, who did not read the book, commented that this part of the story could have been better, but since it never existed in the first place, we can see why Fellowship of the Rings couldn't win Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay.The other flaw is that, after the Council of Elrond, the story's pace becomes faster, but at what cost? In the second half the Hobbits (and Frodo) seem to be deminished from their roles by Aragorn, ogres, orcs, elves, and only seem to be some kind of irritation. Making it longer by twenty minutes could help.(I'm the only person who wants this longer)And the balrog, despite being wonderfully done, dissapointed me because he looks like a run-of-the-mill demon.Other than that, the movie's fine.",8,0,0,28 March 2002
Spirited Away," A bit confusing...but BEAUTIFUL!
","This is the first time I consciously watched a movie by Miyazaki Hayou (I watched the butchered version of 'Valley of the Winds' which doesn't count anyway) and I have to say it's brilliant. Although the story lags it never bores. It's confuses and confounds and you forgive it for that. Most movies you want some underlying logic. Outside of basic Shintoism there is no logic and maybe that's what makes the movie great. It's not bound to Medieval Japan or the Modern one but is sort of trapped in between.
My favourite part is the 'Oh my, a paper-cut!' bit.The only part I really disliked is Noh-Face's rampage. It seems to be the only thing that really doesn't fit. It's too eccentric and shifts the movie a bit out of place.Other than that it's fine. But I guess some people won't buy Haku's real identity (which is a bit OUT THERE, I must admit). But I'd really like to own this movie on DVD, because it's a beautiful movie.",Null,0,0,1 July 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Sigh. So much for that idea.
","Without a doubt 'The Two Towers' is a magnificent epic motion picture even that will go down into the list of Classic Movies. It's bound to pop up on several top-100 movies list and will probably end up in my DVD collection.(!! SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS !!)There's only one problem. THIS IS NOT THE STORY TOLKIEN WROTE! The story was changed too much. What's with Aragorn falling from a cliff into a river and getting saved by Trigger, the world's smartest horse? Pah! Pooh! Ack! What about the Uruk-Hai Orc yelling 'Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys?' Ugh! Eeek! Pooh! And let's not forget that when they made Faramir mean they made him BORING! And why wouldn't Treebeard want to fight while in the book he clearly wanted to? Because Peter Jackson either does not understand the intricacies of the book or he just ignored it.Not too mention some of the changes brought into the book ONE MASSIVE inconsistancy. When Faramir takes Frodo and Sam to the besieged city (which was obviously inspired by 'Saving Private Ryan') one of the Ring Wraiths attempt to seize Frodo. The inconsistancy lies in the fact that he has been spotted. So this is how it works; if the Black-Riders Ring Wraiths know, the Sauron Knows. If Sauron knew the Ring was so close then he would have send all his forces to that spot to capture Frodo and the Ring. Since, in the movie, this didn't happen, we now have something that does not make sense. The Dark Lord would have guessed what they were up to and would have tried to stop them.Another major problem is the fact that Jackson threw out all of Tolkiens subtleties and blew everything out of proportion. (Although the part where the Ents rampage through Isengard is still a great view! Ha!).
Sigh. 'Fellowship of the Ring' had it's forgivable faults. 'The Two Towers' is almost unforgivable.",Null,1,1,1 July 2003
Moulin Rouge!," Now I know what it's like to be on pot!
","That's pretty much the effect the movie left on me. It was bright splashes of sound, colour and general halucigenic imagery that it leaves your head spinning when you're done watching it.Not that it's a bad movie. I've liked, although the first hour Luhrmann tries to be, maybe, a bit TOO weird. He tries to give us too much in the first hour, and then there's far to much post-production slow motion. Far too much.Other than that Moulin Rouge! is great! The last hour is brilliant, even though it is a bit raunchy. And who can forget Nicole and Ewan's singing! Great!But I guess, like pot, you might be left with a headache at end. Beware the Weird Red Windmill if you don't like Strange Cinema.And if you don't like it, I understand completely!",Null,1,2,6 August 2002
Black Hawk Down," What I wanted 'The Siege' (1998) to be.
","Remember that small hit (if it was one) in 1998 with Bruce Willis and Denzel Washington about New York being attacked by an terrorist force. I was disappointed in that movie because the 'force' laying 'siege' to New York was just a bunch of crazy loonies with TNT strapped to their chests running around and blowing stuff up. Boom!With a title like 'the Siege' I expected an invasion force rolling off at NY harbour and starts running through buildings, people running in panic and entire buildings being toppled. Then the US army would come in, try to take control of the situation and run around, trying to chase the invasion force out of New York after much have been destroyed. But I didn't get that. The closest I came, that year, to that sorely missed movie experience was GODZILLA!Then, out of nowhere came Black Hawk Down to rid me of a movie I had wanted to see back then! Not that it had toppling buildings, demolishing tanks, and Mogadishu remained as intact as what it was before the battle depicted in the movie. But instead of the US army chasing around the invades it turned out the US army was the invaders and the Mogadishins were trying to chase them out and that was good enough for me!On a more serious note BLACK HAWK DOWN wasn't as much as an anti-war movie (which it is) as a warning to America that said 'keep your noses out of nonsense that did not involve you!'. After September 11th this idea, which was indirectly caused by operations such as this one.All the acting is superb, the location was excellent and breathtaking and looks like a warzone. The action is grizzly, the pain is practically real. It will make you laugh, it would make some cry, but it is definetly the best war movie of the new mellenium and all others, especially those in a modern setting, would have to be compared to Black Hawk Down.And if Black Hawk Down doesn't take your fancy as a warmovie you could always view it as a comedy of errors.",Null,1,1,17 September 2002
Psycho," Musaeum Piece, unfortunately...
","I really like this movie, I really like Hithcock and I really liked Psycho. But unfortunately Psycho, thanks to pop-culture references and Time, had degraded over the years into nothing more than a museaum piece. Unlike Vertigo, which needed time to ferment before being accepted, Psycho is now, like 'Beowolf' or 'The Devine Comedy' something that not all would find appealing.It deserves the name 'Classic' but it doesn't deserve the place as 'The No. 1 Most Suspensful Movie Ever Made.' Sorry.The music, on the other hand, is timeless...",Null,0,2,11 December 2002
The Lion King," Boo! Hiss!
","I'm very angry at Disney for adding that dumb song 'Morning Report' to the movie. It's just plain stupid. It is one of the worst songs ever to make it's way into a Disney musical. Next the Seven Dwarfs from 'Snow White' is going to do an Eminem Song in a Special Edition of the Classic. Ugh! I just wish Disney would stop fidgeting George Lucas-like with their movies!The Theatrical Release of The Lion King is an all time classic. It's hard to access on the DVD, but it's far better than the Special Edition. The Special Edition is an inferior version that makes me sick...",Null,0,0,1 December 2003
The Shawshank Redemption," Unorginal Prison Fairytale my hairy foot!
","***SPOILERS***    ***SPOILERS*** Imagine me as an old man with a beard sitting on the stoep (porch) waving my cane at people passing by.'How dare you call the Shawshank Redemption an unorginal prison fairytale! It is not supposed to be a run of the mill prison movie. Its not supposed to be The Birdman of Alcatraz! It's not supposed to be MIDNIGHT EXPRESS! It's not even supposed to be Stir Crazy, you wippersnappers! The prison is only the backdrop! It's about overcoming the odds when you are at your rope's end. This is a movie about hope and finding it in the darkest and dreariest of places.'This movie could easily have been set in Nazi Germany in opressed Germany, in a concentration camp, in a 19th century work house! It's about breaking free from things that oppress us needlessly! (Spoiler starts here) Andy is the only person in prison that doesn't belong there! If he had done something bad he would have accepted it, but he didn't, so he tunnels through a wall to freedom. (Spoiler ends here).'Sentimentalism can be bad in a movie if handled incorrectly, but Darabont uses it better than other Capra impersonators out there (even beating the Coens with their Hudsucker Proxy). And there is nothing wrong with sentimentality in The Shawshank Redemption. And I can't see what cliches you are talking about. Just because good things happen doesn't mean they cliches.'This is a meditative movie. It's also has a lot of little things to enjoy for repeat viewing. So get off your high-horse and enjoy this movie.'This is all I have to say.'Get back onto his chair and blows bubbles out of his pipe.",10,0,0,11 September 2002
Amélie," Gnomes, ID photos & suicidal fish.
","I'm not a lover of French cinema. I'm am a half-liker of Art House Cinema. But this movie is great, in a limited capacity.I can see why some art-house goers did not like 'Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain', since it doesn't bear any of the art-house characteristics (depressing message about the hopelessnes of life, detailed sex, and characters that die in the rain of an overdose of some drug).This movie is a whimsical delight for the eye and ear, while having the message 'that if you do good things you would be rewarded' karma-type nonsense. Much better than a movie about dance marathon on the Titanic while it is sinking and being looked on by other ships who don't want to help them. (Yes, there's no movie like that, but you never know what the French might do!). The art of the movie in how it is put together. Each shot was planned to the last dot, sketched. There's no rugged post-production slow motion, no bad special effects. The planning had to be done to a T! For instance: one scene, four ID photos start talking to one of the characters. And the photos are all the same person. And then they start arguing with each other! Yikes. How do you plan something like that?The special effects are excellent, the sound effects weird, the pacing bizarre, the characters are bizarre, yet human in a looney way. Fun, fun, fun. Maybe be just slightly too perverse to take seriously (sex-jokes never seem to make you take movies seriously; why do you think the Monty Python movies never won any Oscars?).It depicts Montmatre as a beautiful district in the heart of Paris (in reality they had to paint some houses to cover up graffiti) where dreams come true and outcasts meet. I suggest you go see it if you don't want a headache because of 'Mulholland Drive' or a tear for 'In the Bedroom'.",Null,0,1,18 May 2002
Kagemusha," Akira Kurosawa Strikes Back!
","After spending a decade (or so) in solitary confinement from the Japanese Film Industry Akira Kurosawa returns to make his semi-masterpiece 'Kagemusha', which he called a dress-rehearsal for 'Ran', made in 1985.Kagemusha is, probably, the best example of cinematic overkill where nobody actually cares. Cinematic overkill is when someone constructs a complex multi-layered movie, stage epic-battles, introduce likeable and complex characters without having a very complicated message. The message of 'Kagemusha' is simply this: If you pretend long enough to be something else you'll become it. Too simple, maybe, for what's delivered.Not that 'Kagemusha' is a bad movie. It's haunting, it's spectacular and it's just great. I keep thinking about it over and over. I can't get it out of my head. Simply put 'Kagemusha' is a masterpiece, albeit one up for debate. Not all Kurosawa fans would like it, but that's they're business. Personally, this is one of the movies currently that I'd really like to see again.PS: Thank goodness for George Lucas and Francis Ford Copolla who funded this movie.",Null,32,50,9 September 2003
Rear Window," Rear window effectiveness!
","There has always been this irritating desire to know what your neighbours are doing, even though it is none of your business. Jeff (James Stewart) is not like that. But he is stuck in a wheelchair with a large telescopic camera lens near him, and his one neighbour is acting VERY suspicious. And so this silly, yet brilliantly spellbounding movie, is off.But that's the problem. It builds up far too long (longer than most Hitchcock movies), but once it gets going you forget about it (untill it's over that is).But since 99% of this movie takes place in one room, it's rather, if you asked me, a piece of experimental cinema. But the experiment (unlike SOME movies) succeeds so that, once it gots started, you FEEL like your in James Stewarts wheelchair, watching whatever is happening (no spoilers here).
Brilliant, cried I! It's well worth the long build-up. But a lot of people wont like the build up! They prefer loonies who kills you like an urban legend, rather than realism. Shucks. Very effective movie, Rear Window. Do you yourself a favor, draw your curtains, rent it and watch it! And remember, you are always being watched.",Null,0,2,17 May 2002
