The Blair Witch Project," I was so scared & disturbed it had me in tears...
","Three young people enter the woods to film a documentary on the myth of The Blair Witch. Does the myth have some truth in it, or is it just a scary story passed down over the years. Heather, Mike & Josh intend to find out. A year after their travel their footage was found, and the movie is their footage put together.'The Blair Witch Project' is a creepy psychological horror film. Stepping away from hack 'em up slasher movies, Blair Witch is more of a 'what was that noise?!' kind of film. Your imagination plays host a lot of the time. The more wild your imagination runs the more scared you get.And certainly it's not a 'jump out of your seat' scary film, its more of a 'jump out of your mind' film. During the film there were two scenes that were extremely creepy, but the ending is the best part (or worst depending on how you look at it!). Coming up to the end I was rather disturbed, but the final scenes tipped me over the edge. The final scene had me in tears I was so scared and disturbed, I was almost shaking.And through all the scares it actually contains quite a bit of humour. I was impressed with the three leads, all conveying a sense of terror in their own way. Heather is a really nice character, I would have like to have seen more of her. The interviews with the locals at the beginning were also very interesting and well done.A lot of horror films have made me scared or jump out of my seat, but none have ever made me so frightened I started to cry...9/10",9,1,2,25 August 2002
Unbreakable," The Sux Sense
","David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is the only survivor in a horrific train trash. Remarkably he doesn't break a bone, or even have a scratch on him. On the other end of the scale is Elijah Prince (Samuel L. Jackson), whose bones are as brittle as glass. Elijah thinks the two have a special bond, total opposites. David thinks not. But upon thinking about the situation, and having some revelations, David starts thinking that Elshia might be right. But is he just falling into a trap or does he really have remarkable powers, the gift of being 'unbreakable'?I am a huge fan of M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Sixth Sense', so I was always very interested in seeing 'Unbreakable'.While I enjoyed most of the film, I ultimately left the film with a huge feeling of disappointment.There are several scenes that are just totally contrived, such as the 'kid with gun' scene. How that cut made it into the final edit, I have no idea! And the weight-lifting scene just goes on and on. And a few plot hole/inconsistencies really played on my mind. When I first heard about the plot I thought it sounded really interesting. But while watching the film the premise ran around my mind, and I started getting really bothered by it.Setting that aside, the film offers some intrigue. And the beginning is quite interesting. However the film is really let down by the end. We have to endure a really long, quite pointless scene. And then the twist! The 'Sixth Sense' this ain't. While it is slightly creepy, it was kind of predictable and ultimately unsatisfying. While looking back at it, it seems rather ridiculous.*** SPOILER ALERT ***
And what is with ripping off 'The Dead Zone'? If his bones are unbreakable fine, but what is up with touching people and seeing things. That whole story-line seemed very under-written and got quite boring. If this premise was talked about earlier, than that would have been OK (if a little unbelievable). But to spring this on us so late. Thats not good.*** END OF SPOILER ***Bruce Willis comes across as not very good. Though Samuel L. Jackson is as good as ever. The supporting cast don't provide sterling performances, though nothing really bad. There are some nice looking scenes. My favorite being the comic book store (not Elisha's 'Limited Edition'), very dark and stylish. And the photography is quite nice. The music score, however, is forgettable.This isn't a really bad film, just very disappointing. A lot of the good scenes are stained by the poor ones. If it was the only thing on television on a rainy Saturday afternoon I would probably give it another outing. But I certainly won't be going out of my way to see it again.7/10",7,5,9,11 June 2003
The Others," Good or Great? Hmmm...
","War World II has finished, and Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her two children, Anne and Nicholas, live in a huge foreboding mansion. Grace sadly, and perhaps naively, awaits the return of her husband, who went off to fight. Currently Grace has no home help, but she doesn't have to worry for too long. One day three people knock on the door and offer to be her servants. Grace not only needs help for the garden and cleaning but also for her children, who are photosensitive, which essentially means they are allergic to light. Keeping the children away from all light, except for dim candle-light, is a hard job, and this has taken it's toll on poor Grace. But soon Grace will have something else to worry about.A weird noise here, a bizarre occurrence there. Strange things are happening in the house. Is it ghosts? Is it Grace's imagination? Or is she going mad? And do the three servants have anything to do with this, or are they innocent bystanders?When the credits started rolling, I didn't know what to make of this film. I had enjoyed it for the most part, but near the end I started to wonder whether the film really was as smart as it thought it was. I had heard the film contained a nice twist, and when I watched what I thought was supposed to be the twist I was greatly disappointed. But I was wrong, and the film had a little bit more to go. I enjoyed the twist, but I don't think it's of jaw-dropping quality. Which is quite like the whole movie, very understated. If you only like big action movies, this isn't for you. I enjoyed the slow pace of the film, and the score is very nice, along with the cinematography. I enjoyed all the performances, with the children being stand-outs, and Nicole Kidman as good as ever. One complaint is that I would have liked more scenes with Lydia.In the first half of the film there were several scenes, that while not boring, I thought weren't as amazing as the movie seemed to make of them. However, upon finding out of the twist I feel these scenes would have a bigger impact on me. So I certainly will be going back for a second viewing.
I have seen the other film by writer/director Alejandro Amenabar, Abre los ojos, and enjoyed it greatly, and I look forward to seeing more films from him.Whether this is a good or great film doesn't really matter, have no doubt, this is a very fine film. I just didn't know how good it was. I couldn't decide whether to give it an 8 or 9. If I could, I'd give it a 8.5 out of 10. But I can't, so...8/10",8,1,2,31 May 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Martial Arts meets Romance
","Li Mu Bai wishes to no longer own an ancient and beautiful sword, it brings back to many bad memories, so he gives it to his friend Sir Te. That night someone brakes into their compound and steals the sword. What ensures is a breathtaking fight scene. The martial arts in this movie are wonderful, but the 'flying' is purely incredible.Li Mu Bai and his friend Yu Shu Lien then try to get the sword back. The film then takes on some different sub-plots, including a very bizarre but nice love story, so I won't reveil anymore of the story.Cue more breathtaking fight scenes, a very long but amazing flashback, scores aplenty to settle and some beautifully filmed scenes.Michelle Yeoh is as nice as ever. She is a wonderful actress and I greatly enjoy seeing her in all her movies. Ziyi Zhang (Jen Yu) is also a very beautiful and talented actress. The cinematography is wonderful. The flying in the fight scenes just amazed me and the bamboo tree scenes near the end are to beautiful for words.
Only complaint, one of the special effects near the end of the movie looked rather cheesy.'Wo Hu Cang Long' is a medium paced martial arts film, combined with a touching romantic story, and a nice, if at times a little slow (not a bad thing in this case), look at Chinese culture. Ultimately the film asks questions about life.I greatly enjoyed this film and would recommend it for both lovers of martial arts and romantic films.9/10",9,1,1,23 August 2002
Mulholland Drive," Masterpiece of Mystery
","'Mulholland Dr.' is a one way street to mystery, suspense and a hefty dose of 'what the?!'The movie starts out with a woman in a beautiful dress being driven along Mulholland Dr. in a long black limousine. The limousine pulls to a stop and the driver pulls a gun on the woman. Before he can do anything a car of speeding teenagers hits the limousine, killing everyone except the woman. She wonders around for a bit before falling asleep in the garden of some apartments. When she wakes up she hides herself in a woman's apartment.That apartment belongs to Betty's Aunt. Betty has arrived in L.A. to kick start her movie career. While her Aunt is away Betty will be staying in her apartment.When Betty and the 'limousine woman' meet they realize the woman has amnesia. Together they try to solve the mystery. Who is the woman? Where does she live? Why did the driver pull a gun on her? And why is there a heap of money in her handbag along with a blue key? Their journey will take them on a wild journey of mystery.But Mulholland Dr. is not that simple. There is a bigger mystery lurking.***SPOILERS*** ONLY READ IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIEOkay, so you've seen the movie. Pretty confusing huh! Well maybe it isn't. Mulholland Dr. is unlike most films as its ending can be taken in many ways.1) The first and best idea is that the first part of the movie is a dream/fantasy. Right after the dancing bit at the beginning we see someone going to sleep on a bed. This is telling us its a dream right from the start! And the rest of the events near the end of the movie is reality. Salon.com has an awesome theory on this, read it and the movie's plot will seem very simple. Really!2) The whole movie is reality, but it takes place in two different realities. This is the first theory I thought of after viewing the movie the first time. The blue box is almost like a transporter between dimensions.3) All of the movie is a dream. This is my least favourite theory, but if you think about it it does make sense. When we dream a lot of the time the dream will move onto different scenes and characters and rarely make sense in a normal way.*** END OF SPOLIERS ***Mulholland Dr. is like many different movies. You can watch it with a certain theory, and next time watch it with a different theory. Choose your favourites and even try to come up with crazy ideas. Or you can just watch the film without trying to work out what it's trying to say and marvel at it's beauty.The acting is excellent. Particularly Naomi Watts, who does an amazing job. Her acting in this movie blew me away, she is an awesome actress and should have won an Oscar for her performance.Angelo Badalamenti's score is just wonderful to listen to and creates an amazing atmosphere.'Mulholland Dr.' is like a painting. For example, take a painting of a Mother and her baby. One person may view the painting as very beautiful and a display of the bond a Mother and child feels. A different person may take it differently. Say, a Mother who lost her child. The painting may bring back sad memories and this person may feel the painting is sad and upsetting instead of beautiful. One painting. Two different ideas and feelings. Mulholland Dr.: One movie, many ideas. It's almost like David Lynch created a moving painting. Maybe being a painter from way back he feels as if paintings and movies can be the same kind of art. I truly love this movie and get great feelings when thinking about it's amazing logic and mystery. And it contains a very funny hitman bungle scene to boot.Remember, with most mystery movies the mystery is in the movie. Mulholland Dr. maybe one of the only films where the mystery is not only in the film but also the film as a whole.A masterpiece that you don't have to 'get' to love.10/10",10,3,4,23 August 2002
The Sixth Sense," Future Classic
","The Sixth Sense chilled me to the bone, with it's excellent performances, brilliant storytelling and wonderful directing by M. Night Shyamalan (who also wrote the screenplay). Malcom Crowe (Willis) is a child psychologist, and Cole (Osment) is Malcom's latest patient. I won't reveal anymore of the plot, as I feel less known about it the better. The film has a tremendous amount of atmosphere that oozes out of the screen, engulfing your every sense. There were at least two scenes that made me jump! And the film also has some rather funny moments, namely the video camera scene. If you never thought Bruce Willis was a very good actor, your mind will definitely be changed after seeing his excellent portrayal of Crowe. Australian born Toni Collette shines as Cole's Mother. And Haley Joel Osment brings shame to almost every other child actor in a film. He truly is a gifted actor, and I look forward to watching his career blossom. Much has been said of the films ending, and I don't dare say anything about it. Only that it is truly amazing. In the future I feel this film will be looked on as a landmark in cinematic brilliance in every aspect. 9/10",9,0,0,14 July 2002
