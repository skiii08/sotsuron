The Incredible Hulk," A pleasant surprise!
","HULK SMASH! 'The Incredible Hulk', while not without it's flaws, is a much leaner and meaner version of the comic book tale than Ang Lee's disappointing 'Hulk'. Instead of delving too deep into psychological issues and family trauma, the new film keeps moving and never strays from the action.Now let's get something out of the way that bothered me a lot. 'The Incredible Hulk' cheats here by being a sequel to a film that doesn't exist! It's not an origin story but it's not a sequel to Lee's film either. The opening sequence recaps events that didn't actually take place in 'Hulk' and this makes the first ten or fifteen minutes especially awkward. It's almost like you have to do your homework on HOW the Hulk gets created before turning up, which is OK I guess because it's such a well known character.Now onto the positives. The opening action sequence in Rio's shanty towns is amazing, up there with something out of the Bourne movies, except with the added bonus of including a Hulking-out scene! Ed Norton and Tim Roth are both good as enemies while their digital counterparts are also rather impressive but more on those in a sec. There's some nice humour thrown into the mix, stopping the film from getting too serious.With ten times more energy than 'Hulk', the movie leaps from one action sequence to another and although it gets a little bit choppy later on, it's much better than the incoherent finale of the other version. The effects range from fantastic to that kind of gravity defying look that most comic book movies seem to pick up. But on the whole I was impressed and every time the Hulk gets mad (which is a lot in this film) it always makes you smile.The final battle between Hulk and Roth's Abomination is savage stuff, with the pair roaring and growling like wild beasts. If you a bit let down by the Transformers-lite showdown of Iron Man, then you might prefer this one which I'd say is better.Sorry if this review is all over the place, I just felt I needed to say that 'Incredible Hulk' is a pleasing entry into the genre and I'm actually looking forward to the inevitable sequel!",7,3,8,12 June 2008
Hot Fuzz," Funny but frustrating
","First off, Hot Fuzz is a funny film... most of the time. It\\\\\\\'s also a great action film... some of the time. Pegg and Frost are good as the leads, but the show is stolen by sneering villain Timothy Dalton who seems to be really enjoying himself.The problem with Fuzz is the running time. Instead of thinking about pace and plot, the film was written deliberately to last 2 hours exactly which is risky for a comedy. There are some great gags in Fuzz, but also a lot of empty space, uninspiring characterisation and wasted cameos.The action is fairly light, consisting of foot chases until... the final shootout which is the most fun I've had in a cinema since... well, Rocky Balboa. But the point is, it's a great sequence that ranks up there with Shaun of the dead.Hot Fuzz is very much a hit and miss film. It misses an awful lot, but when it hits, it hits you with a shotgun to the head and a spinning kick out the window.3/5",8,1,4,15 February 2007
The Expendables," Mostly successful and action-packed
","'The Expendables' is an old-school throwback to the 80s, we all know this was the intention from the beginning and overall I think it succeeded.The plot is perfect action movie fodder; the Latin American dictator, the slimy villain in the suit pulling the strings, the traitor in the group, the gang of big hard-nuts carrying even bigger firepower etc. Aside from a sub-plot for Statham's character, which slows the film, 'The Expendables' walks a well-trodden path, but delivers some cracking action along the way. In terms of pacing, Stallone has ensured that the action only gets bigger as the film reaches it's climax. Unlike this summer's 'A-Team' which I enjoyed, this peaks at the right moments.In this situation, analysing characterisation and story is pointless. Genre classics such as 'Commando', 'Cobra' and 'Predator' were about the mission in hand. The characters may not be as memorable, but they all look the part and get their chance to shine. Those films I mentioned were definitely snappier in terms of dialogue - which is my only real gripe with this film.Like the last Rambo movie, there is a period at the beginning where the dialogue is forced and laboured. In 'Rambo', Stallone tries to make a point about humanity and redemption etc. but in this case it's more to provide a punchline on which to close the scene. The cameo with Bruce and Arnold is the best example; awkward and not very funny. Similarly, the group scenes (of which are surprisingly few) don't try hard enough to create a sense of camaraderie which we never buy into.However, the stilted dialogue stops being such a problem once the plot kicks into gear on Stallone's first trip to Vilena. Speaking of Sly, it was nice to see the man himself back in some proper nasty brawls again.This leads us to the action, which I think Sly has delivered on in spades. The final half-hour is obviously the talking point here, but I also enjoyed various sequences throughout. The dock explosion HAS to be seen on the big screen, it's that epic. Fight scenes were fast and brutal and while some people criticise the camera-work, I was never lost during these scenes. Only the car chases were too frantically shot in my opinion. The finale is truly some of the best action I've EVER seen with an energy that few films of this type manage to capture. Needless to say, the entire tunnel sequence (featuring some kick-ass brawling and Terry Crews' monster of a shotgun) will go down in action movie lore for years to come.'The Expendables' never overstays it's welcome and that's a refreshing thing in this age of 150mins+ epic family movies. It's short, to the point and a great slice of brainless fun and I am certainly looking forward to the sequel!",6,1,5,30 August 2010
The Bourne Ultimatum," Superior spy thriller and a great close to an excellent trilogy
","The Bourne trilogy is certain to be considered one of the best ever, especially when compared with the uneven Pirates, Matrix and Spiderman outings. In terms of consistency, Bourne has come up with the goods for all three films, with Ultimatum being a fitting, breathless and stylish conclusion.Unlike the previous two films however, Ultimatum plunges headlong into the action before the title card even appears. Picking up from where the last film, Supremacy, left off, we follow Bourne as his escapes Moscow and continues to pursue his past. As more detailed flashbacks start to emerge, Bourne gets closer than ever to finding out his origins as an assassin. His first stop is a British reporter who has been getting leaked information on Bourne and various black ops.The pace of the film is relentless and aside from a scene where Bourne visits his dead girlfriend's brother, there is barely a moment to catch a breath. This is because, once again, the CIA are determined to find Bourne and terminate him at all costs. This time, his journey takes him across four continents with a whole bunch of hit men after him. The action sequences are, once again, fantastic and include a number of brutal punch-ups and a couple of awesome chase sequences.The story itself is very satisfying, with revelatory moments packing the punch they need. This is helped largely by the late appearance of Albert Finney as Bourne's 'creator'. Matt Damon fits back into the role like a pair of old slippers and there's not one weak link in the chain, with regards to the other actors and the script.In fact, Ultimatum plays like a greatest hits of the first two Bourne films - not just in terms of action. The score brings together all the music from Identity and Supremacy, while key scenes and lines are recreated. Incidentally, there's also a brilliant moment where the last scene from Supremacy is used (the conversation between Landy and Bourne), which shows that this is a trilogy that rewards those paying attention as well as those in search of a slam-bang chase thriller.",9,1,2,16 August 2007
Predator," They just don't make them like this anymore
","Predator is my favourite film, next to Rocky, and has always had a special place in my heart. Scaring me to death as a youngster, the film succeeds completely in merging different genres together. For the first part, a gung-ho action flick - for the second part, a nerve-jangling horror that develops into a tremendous adventure film.The film feels like a real team effort, much like the heroes of the film itself. Everyone involved in the production has brought something creative, unique or memorable to the table and has made Predator become a hugely popular film and franchise.Firstly, the scipt is chock-full of classic dialogue, making this one of the most quoted films in history, with so many cheesy one-liners that you've be forgiven for thinking the characters were being hunted by a hungry mouse. However, the script and the premise is genius - by simply pitting an alien hunter against Earth's finest prey, humans (commandos even), the situations write themselves; boy-scout traps, mud-camouflaged Arnie and the villain which imitates and toys with its prey. The sequel, which is OK but not a classic, managed to develop this idea even further with a wider arsenal and deeper understanding of the alien race, which gives this film a little something to separate it from other standard Alien-ripoffs.Secondly, director John McTiernan keeps the film zooming along at a sensible pace. When there's any danger of actual character development, we move straight on to the next scene and dispense with said character lol. There's a tremendous atmosphere as the commandos enter the jungle - it's like another world and straight away the audience is thrown out of its seat with a shocking discovery up in the trees. In fact, the massive outbursts of violence in Predator are still very savage today and despite more violence now getting through censors, we don't get to see anything quite so shocking as skinned corpses and spinal cords being ripped out! Eventually, the tension is cranked up to breaking point as it's left to Arnie to 'stick around' and avenge his team, Tarzan-style.Next, the visual effects people should be congratulated. From amazing pyrotechnics to the legendary heat vision and camouflage which is part of Predator's unique quality. Even today, the image of a blurry silhouette running through the jungle gives me the shivers and when the final battle kicks in, sparks truly fly. The cameo-effect is one of the best special effects i've ever seen and feels like the discovery of bullet time or something just as classic.Thank the lord for Stan Winston, who practically saved the film by ditching the original dopey design of the Predator and coming up with the masked humanoid with some nice dreadlocks. Most people prefer Giger's Alien design over this, but I always prefer the Predator, largely thanks to Kevin Peter Hall's performance. Instead of a guy in a suit, which Alien eventually seemed like at the end, we get a nasty looking alien under a mask. Never do we think that it's just a bloke under there. The Predator swings from to tree to tree like a monkey and bounds great distances like Frankenstein's monster on steroids. Instead of a clumsy, fake alien, we get something that really does act and look intelligent enough to hunt a team of crack commandos. The appearance itself is truly memorable and it's debatable whether the Pred looks cooler with or without his metal mask.As I said before, it's a real ensemble effort and even the actors bring something to the film that stands out. We don't need character development for this type of film, we just need something that makes each guy different so that we know who's getting wasted - a problem which many monster flicks mess up by throwing in a bunch of blands. Here, every character is radically different; Dutch, the sensible team-leader (although Arnie doesn't exactly need to be distinguished), Dillon who has shades of Apollo Creed in trying to keep his cool and save face, Mac who starts off quite laid back and eventually goes mad, Blain who utters the best one-liners and carries a bleeding mini gun around(!), Billy the tracker who is just out-there and knows something's wrong from the off, Poncho who speaks Spanish and wields a grenade launcher and Hawkins who reads comics, works the radio and tells dirty jokes.Finally, the score needs mentioning as this is one of the most atmospheric soundtracks ever and adds to the films pounding tension. As soon as we enter the jungle, the music spells doom for all with subtle tones that soon explode to life. Considering how much hiking through jungle there is (and yeah, the locations people should be noted as well because this is some truly bad-ass bush), it's surprising we don't feel it because the whole time Alan Silvestri keeps us entertained with the film's classic theme tune.Spawning a decent sequel and countless other media, it goes to show the power of Predator. It all started here, when it was just considered an alien-ripoff but has since shrugged off those roots and claimed it's own slice of history. Everyone involved in the film has contributed something - it's as though their careers have all peaked at the same time and met up on this film. The result is just quality; remarkable, memorable and exhilarating.",10,13,15,20 April 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Entertaining? Yes. Flawed? Oh yes.
","First of all I'm not a comic fanboy, just a faithful follower of the movie series. I remember when we first saw Toad and his wicked tongue, when there was that huge mystery of Wolverine's background and when we first saw Magneto working his magic. Therefore my disappointment comes from feeling a little cheated after six years and three films.Singer basically kick-started the comic book film again with X-Men and it was mature, intriguing and funny. Then, X2 capitalised on the plot threads with great enthusiasm. Now, it's up to Brett Ratner...As another reviewer mentioned, you can only criticize Ratner so much. His directorial style is rather bland, for sure, but with a decent script, they can be elevated. Rush Hour was funny, Red Dragon was based on a decent story to being with. X3, however, has some truly awful dialogue and it's handling of popular (even certain unpopular) characters is disgusting.The so-called 'plot' involves a so-called 'cure' this time. However, this plot device is thrown away by the end, suggesting that the cure doesn;t even work. So apart from certain deaths, the situation of many mutants seems to return to normal which only proves this is not the last stand were promised and certainly not the epic showdown we expected.There are some juicy set-pieces, I'll tell you now. Once again, they all involve Magneto and his amazing powers which allow his to 'fly' the Golden Gate bridge to Alcatraz and crush an entire motorcade effortlessly. The action sequences, or fight scenes, are less coherent and the fact that there are only a few X-Men involved at the final battle emphasises that this is not the film it should have been. Characters are killed or rendered useless, otherwise they are simply shoved to the side, to allow for the new generation of anonymous characters to show off. It angers me to see how veteran X-Men are written out-of-character and discarded so easily.So should you see X3? Yes, for the usual mutant shenanigans, but no for seeing you favourite characters become shadows of their former selves.",6,0,0,30 May 2006
The Mist," Overall, a nice horror package but has it's fair share of problems
","The Mist is a rare film you'll probably get to see it 'clean' (with no spoilers or even much expectation at all). It's not a big film and is shot more like a TV movie than a Hollywood blockbuster. In a small American town, the residents become trapped in a supermarket by a thick mist - but soon realise that something is IN the mist. A siege ensues that becomes as much about the human soul as it does about the nasties outside.On the whole, I liked 'The Mist' and I think it was a decently acted piece, with a strong human element that's sorely lacking in today's horror movies. Tom Jane is very likable as the typical 'everyman' to which people gravitate towards to at times of crisis. Marcia Gay Harden is delightfully OTT as a Christian fanatic who gradually convinces the townsfolk that it's God's will that they be destroyed. As the situation worsens, so does the behaviour of the people and this becomes one of the more successful parts of the film. The sanctuary of the store, becomes just as dangerous as the mist itself.While it's a proper B-movie, which I love, the lack of a big budget makes some scenes less effective than they should be. The ropey CG is thankfully kept in the mist or the shadows for the most part, but when it's first revealed around the half hour mark, the impact is taken away by the fact that it's clearly not real. The creepiest moments are those where characters go into the mist and where the horror is unseen. The gore effects however, particularly during a gruesome foray into the drug store are impressive and help to counter the CG beasties' deficiencies.As I mentioned before, the acting is pretty good and help to sell the situation. However, there are some incredibly dumb mistakes that lead to disaster (and for a horror film, the fact that they stick out is bad). For instance, if you're holed up in a glass-fronted store, don't leave the electric lamps on display right next to the windows! Or if somethings trying to get under a metal gate... try closing the gate!!! It's a shame that a film which concentrates on the human condition, quite successfully, ends up stretching common sense like that.Now on to the now-famous ending... which I won't give away of course. What I will say is that it's both extremely downbeat AND unexpected. It's bleak, but in a way that you probably wouldn't see coming until it hits you. The idea is fantastic... but I'm not so sure about the execution. First, the music (largely absent until now) smothers the final scenes and changes the entire feel of the film from small intimate B-movie to overwrought epic. Then, the passage of time is so short in the final moments that the outcome loses its impact. Finally, Tom Jane (who has been very good in the film until this point) doesn't quite sell the drama in my opinion. I just don't think the ending manages to deliver the powerful sucker punch it intended - and only a tiny bit of editing would have changed that.But the good things about The Mist make you forgive the flaws unlike some films where they overshadow them. Either way, it's worth a look but rent it first, because this is looking like a case of love it/hate it.",7,1,3,15 August 2008
Transformers," Does exactly what it says in the tin (or battle-worn chassis I should say)
","I braved the torrential rain last night to go see the UK midnight screening of Transformers. But the real thunder was inside the theatre.First, off ignore the snotty critics who have an issue with the premise. Anyone who goes to see a Transformers movie should be ready for metallic brawls and cheesy dialogue. The film gets off to a rip-roaring start, settles down into the story and closes with an extended smackdown between Autobots and Decepticons.The special effects are astounding and will surely bag an Oscar next year, whilst the main performances from Shia LeBeouf and Peter Cullen were brilliant. Fans will be pleased to see various elements in tact from the cartoon. Bumblebee and Sam/Spike's special friendship is the main success at the heart of the film. Also, the Autobot dialogue is pretty much lifted from the cartoon with Megatron and Prime taunting and exchanging dialogue during their climactic fight.The humour was spot-on although it felt more forced as the film got down to business. Typical Bay-isms were all present and correct, which leads me to my main criticism. The action was at times disorientating and hard to distinguish. Transformers dive past the camera so quickly that it spoils an otherwise flawless sequence.If anyone was left disappointed by the lack of Decepticon footage, then I'm sure the inevitable sequel will up the stakes. All in all, the film did exactly what it set out to do and I have no issue with that.",8,0,1,20 July 2007
The Dark Knight," Flawless and thrilling, deserves Best Picture.
","This gets a 10 for now simply because I cannot think of a SINGLE thing I didn't enjoy about 'The Dark Knight'. After months of speculation, a massive viral campaign, huge hype and the tragedy of Heath Ledger's passing, the follow up 'Batman Begins' is here.Does it live up to the huge expectations I had going in? It did and more.After months of cleaning up Gotham's streets, Batman sees a chance to live a normal life by passing the reins of crimefighting hero to brave District Attorney Harvey Dent. But when Dent, Batman and Lt. Jim Gordon cut off the mob's funding, the criminal community turns to the unpredictable and dangerous 'Joker'. Essentially one huge social experiment for the Joker, the city of Gotham becomes the battleground for the 'unstoppable force' Joker and the 'immovable object' Batman.I loved the fact that 'The Dark Knight' plays like a high-powered crime thriller for the most part, and the comparisons to 'Heat' and 'The Untouchables' are pretty spot on (especially the latter, with a great partnership between Dent/Batman/Gordon). When the Joker's reign of terror starts to tear Gotham apart, the film becomes relentless and unpredictable.There are strong themes throughout 'The Dark Knight' - a rare blockbuster with more substance than many past Oscar winners. How do you fight a terrorist, without stooping to their own brutality? How do you maintain order, hope and morals in a world gradually falling apart? Questions that are more than relevant in today's climate but also universal themes of integrity and sacrifice. I thoroughly respect Nolan and co. for trading in a traditional plot device of destruction for a more real and natural threat. While 'Begins' had a handy microwave emitter and a hallucinogenic to spread panic, here it's the impossible dilemmas and choices that Joker imposes on the whole city, as well as Batman.One thing I wasn't expecting to like was the third act. I heard that it was rushed and incomplete. I was pleasantly surprised then. Without giving too much away, I can say that the change that occurs and the motives that drive that certain character are perfectly plausible.In this battle of wills, the character development is crucial. Ledger's Joker has no arc, but serves more as a 'plot device' in itself to change the other characters. Dent (played by Aaron Eckhart, who was excellent) gets the best development his inevitable fall from grace is magnificent to watch.While everyone talks about Ledger's performance, I want to talk about Bale. I wasn't expecting much for Batman/Bruce Wayne because the focus has shifted to the villains again. But it was nice to see that Bruce still has some issues to deal with and not break his 'one rule' in the face of a new type of villain. Bale's gruff Batman voice was grating at first, but I'm already used to it and understand why it's used, so even that didn't spoil my enjoyment.Gary Oldman gets much more to do this time around, and even Lt. Gordon gets some tough decisions to make. Gordon is brought to life by the excellent Oldman, bringing both courage and fear to the role, making it more realistic. Maggie Gyllenghaal was much more lively and likable than Katie Holmes' preachy, moany Rachel Dawes and becomes a major factor in the storyline later on.Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman don't undergo a HUGE change but rather serve to deliver a shred of hope thanks to some wise words. These scenes REALLY help to balance the tone and stop 'The Dark Knight' from becoming depressing.OK, so NOW let's talk about Ledger. Three years ago when Batman Begins first signalled the Joker's arrival, I was gutted. But that was then... this is now and you know what, and this ISN'T because of his death, he does an Oscar-worthy job! He doesn't PLAY the Joker, he becomes the Joker. It's accomplished through a plethora of mannerisms and habits which make the Joker seem so real and threatening. While Nicholson did a great job in 89 (and I'm not one of these people who's going to turn against that film when I still enjoy it), it was a different type of film. This is much more grounded in reality and the Joker has to be scary... and he bloody is! His 'gags' consist of the classic 'chop into pieces' routine as well as the old 'pencil through eye' howler... hilarious eh? Nolan and Ledger understand that ONLY the Joker should find his gags funny and that's why his performance blows away any other. The energy and conviction which Ledger throws at the role deserves an Oscar and that's all that needs to be said.I haven't even got on to the action yet in a review of a Batman film! The major set-piece in the middle is a technical marvel and had me on the edge of my seat. But apart from a death defying glide through Hong Kong, the action is mainly a series of brief but brutal punch-ups. Batman takes out his enemies with efficiency rather than showmanship. This time, however, Nolan actually allows the audience to see what the hell is going on. Here's the best part though - for two and a half hours I wasn't missing the action! Not only that, but the action serves the story in EVERY case.While writing this review I've still been unable to think of a single thing I didn't like, love about 'The Dark Knight'. It's a fantastic balance of thrills, horror and drama, with a small touch of humour (which goes a long way). It's bleak and unsettling yes, but profound and substantial and easily transcends it's genre to become something much greater. It's not just the best film of 2008, not just the best superhero film ever made - it truly is one of the best films I've ever seen - no joke.",10,3,7,25 July 2008
Man on Fire," Over-edited and overlong
","The violence of 'Man on Fire' isn't the problem here. In fact, the hard-as-nails approach we were promised is the reason that I was looking forward to seeing the film.However, this film is prime example of how to run a potentially good film into the ground. The story is good enough and provides amble motivation for the violent second half. The chemistry between Dakokta Fanning and Denzel Washington is superb and gives the film some heart at least. In fact, the performances are all very good - so why five out of ten? Because Tony Scott and co. can't let a good film speak for itself.When you've got great locations, a trio of fantastic actors (Fanning, Washington, Walken) and a emotionally charged premise, why do you need over stylised techniques to make the film work? Just about every single frame is spoilt by flickering, blurry or jittery camera-work. For instance, a simple interrogation sequence becomes a pop-video, full of freeze frames, sped-up imagery and so on. What's wrong with just letting the story flow in its own way? The film is also a bit too long. While it takes the time to build a relationship between the leads, it could still have done with taking 20 minutes out or so. But thats not what makes the film nearly unwatchable, its the director who tries to show off every few minutes and massage his ego.With a different editor and director, the film could have been much better but as it stand, Man on Fire is disappointing.",5,5,12,15 July 2007
The Wrestler," Beautiful but heartbreaking.
","On paper, 'The Wrestler' just seems like another 'Rocky'-type sports movie - but within minutes, that preconception flies out the window and you realise that, despite the well-worn premise, this moving drama is something else entirely.I haven't seen a film in ages that manages to be both uplifting and truly downbeat at the SAME time. There's no clear separation between the two; in 'The Wrestler', those two things stem from one another. This might not make sense until you see the film, but it all comes down to one man, his flaws and his passion. That man is Randy 'The Ram' Robinson.A huge wrestling star in the 80's, Randy has seen his best years pass him by - at the expense of his family. Now, 20 years on, Randy reluctantly works in a supermarket, spends his weekends wrestling at school gyms and community centres for small crowds and otherwise blows his money on steroids and a stripper named Cassidy.Inside the ring, Randy feels alive and most importantly, feels loved. Outside in the real world, his life is an empty mess. What makes 'The Wrestler' so different to standard sports dramas, is not in the fight for victory (after all, the sport itself is inherently a performance), but rather in one man's desperate efforts to maintain the bubble in which he's lived for 20 years. One the one hand, it's thrilling to see him in action but on the other, it's depressing to think that he has nothing else in his life.Randy is a good guy at heart, but generally messes up and doesn't know how to fix his mistakes. After suffering a heart attack, he decides to retire and tries and reconnect with his estranged daughter and build a romance with Cassidy. However, the outcome one might expect is not the one that we get and the effect is heartbreaking.Mickey Rourke absolutely nails the role and truly deserves an Oscar for his honest and emotional performance - he also looks fantastic in the ring. 'Sin City' brought him back to the big time, but this his his show and if he doesn't win that Oscar I'll eat my lycra shorts. Marisa Tomei is pretty good as Cassidy, whose own career parallels with Randy's. Her character, however, knows how to separate her life from her job (also a performance for the cheering crowd) and serves more to demonstrate how Randy is incapable of doing that.The script and direction are both very well done - Darren Aronofsky reins in his own style to suit the story which is admirable. There are still some little touches and subtle tricks, however, which have a tremendous impact. For one example, Randy makes his way to the deli counter for his first shift - the camera follows him as though he's making his way to a big match, with the sounds of cheering crowds in the background. Randy pauses, takes a deep breath and goes through the plastic flaps - and the sound vanishes. It's a perfect insight into Randy's borderline-delusional mind.But Randy isn't crazy, by no means, he's just passionate for one thing in life. Unfortunately, that one thing is just an act, a show - which makes the whole thing so tragic. I recommend 'The Wrestler' and only knocked 1 star off for a couple of times where the film seemed stuck in a routine, whether that was intentional or not, but it wasn't a major problem. Go see it!",9,1,1,20 January 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Revenge of the 'Sixth'
","There's so much to get in this film that its shockingly relentless, but if you can bear with it, its extremely rewarding and Lucas even manages to ADD to the saga's story at one or two points (inc a suggested and tantalising back story to Darth Sidious).The action? 9/10 The dialogue? 5/10 The acting? 6/10 (better performances by McGregor and Christensen) The structure? 8/10 Set pieces? 9/10If you Can put up with the dialogue and acting which have still got better since last time, this is a cracking good film and easily on par with JEDI.",6,1,4,29 August 2005
The Dark Knight Rises," Despite notable flaws, it's a worthy climax to a stunning trilogy
","'It takes a little while to get back into the swing of things' explains loyal butler Alfred during one scene in 'The Dark Knight Rises'. He's right too, as anyone expecting Batman to fly straight back into action will be disappointed. However, if you're expecting a solid and emotional end to Christopher Nolan's trilogy, then you'll be very satisfied.It's eight years since Harvey Dent's death in 'The Dark Knight'. Bruce Wayne has given up the role of Batman, due to the physical and personal toll which it has taken on him - not to mention that Dent's heroic legacy has resulted in organised crime being stamped out in Gotham altogether. So Bruce has become a recluse, his life an empty void without having Batman around. But a new villain, Bane, threatens to destroy Gotham and Batman needs to come back... but does he have the strength, or the spirit, to defeat him? 'The Dark Knight Rises' is not a perfect film by any means. The problems mainly lie in the lack of ideas compared to the last installment. At times, it feels like the most derivative film in the series, with various nods to other films like 'Die Hard With a Vengeance', 'The World is Not Enough' and especially 'Rocky III'. But also, especially towards the climax, it just feels like a bigger, louder rehash of 'Batman Begins', resorting to much more traditional plot devices (ticking time bomb anyone?).That being said, the quality shines though in this film and everything that happens is executed with a flourish. The action sequences are impressively done, especially the fights between Bane and Batman and there are a couple of incredible set-pieces. As you'd expect, though, it's in the quieter, tender moments where the film succeeds. There are some heart-wrenching moments between Christian Bale and Michael Caine as Alfred, who really sells the role of surrogate father to Bruce.There are a lot of new characters (and their subplots) in 'The Dark Knight Rises' which means that, for many, the lengthy first act will have audiences struggling to keep up. Anne Hathaway is very good as Selina Kyle (aka. Catwoman) in a role which I honestly did not expect to like. She adds an element of much-needed humour and playfulness, rather than the more sexualised version we saw in Tim Burton's film. Joseph Gordon-Levitt gets quite a lot of screen time, but isn't quite as convincing, as a cop who catches the eye of Commissioner Gordon (the ever-reliable Gary Oldman).Finally of course, there's Tom Hardy's crucial performance as Bane. After all, what is a Batman film without a decent villain performance? Well don't panic, because Hardy is wonderful and manages to exude more menace and charisma from behind a facemask than many actors can normally. Physically imposing as well as intelligent, it's safe to say that Bane's brutal encounters with Batman easily rank among the highlights of the trilogy.One major problem people will have with 'TDKR' is that there's a severe lack of Batman on screen. This is true, but I think we've reached the stage where we can look on Bruce Wayne in the same light whether he's dressed in the cape and cowl or not. Remarkably, the film maintains the running theme of the trilogy and sees it through - the idea of Batman being a symbol of inspiration, not just a man.Another flaw of 'TDKR' is how events are rushed as we reach the climax. Nolan manages to gather an impressive sea of extras for the film's final confrontation, which takes place after months of misery and oppression from Bane, but drops the ball when within seconds he takes us away from this epic scene in favour of the familiar runaway-vehicle chase sequence (taken straight from 'BB'). Also, a surprise twist is revealed way too late in the game to have any substantial impact on the film.Technically of course, the film is astounding and maintains that level of excellence we've become used to from Nolan's work. The cinematography, special effects and production design all come together nicely. The Hans Zimmer soundtrack is powerful, almost too powerful actually, often drowning out dialogue but in the big scenes it really packs a punch.Overall, I really enjoyed 'The Dark Knight Rises' but felt that I needed a second viewing to really appreciate it. There are more problems but the way the film expands on the backstory and mythos of Batman, along with it's huge emotional clout, easily make up for it's shortcomings.",8,1,3,25 July 2012
Tombstone," Dramatic, epic and downright cool!
","Tombstone is one of all-time favourite films. It's definitely my favourite western. It features one of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen, many of who take meagre supporting roles in a film that never stops entertaining.While perhaps not accurate, Tombstone is the story of retired lawman Wyatt Earp who moves to the title town and plans to go into business with his two brothers Morgan and Virgil. Before long, his reputation attracts the attention of the Cowboys, a gang of vicious outlaws who essentially rule the region. When the Cowboys target Wyatt's family, he and longtime friend Doc Holiday declare all out war on the gang.Tombstone contains some quality acting, sharp dialogue and tense set-pieces which combine to form a truly rousing package. Production values and the score are also top notch. The story takes the odd detour now and then, giving the impression that a much longer version is around somewhere (with lots of characters and sub-plots touched upon). Nevertheless, the appeal of the film comes from it's strong characters.Kurt Russell makes a career-best performance in a role he was born to play. Both quiet and intimidating, he commands authority whilst able to show his more personal feelings and concerns. Val Kilmer is also fantastic as Doc Holiday and for many, he is the stand-out performance.Compared to it's counterpart 'Wyatt Earp', the film goes straight for the jugular and pulls on the heartstrings. As a result, the film is unapologetic in it's violence but also at times very moving.Tombstone is definitely a gem of a western and never have moustaches looked cooler.",9,0,0,23 November 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," It's Die Hard, cleaned up and polished but still entertaining!
","First of all, the feeling that most people will get is that this isn't a true Die Hard film. You can divide the four films into two pairs; one, the trapped, claustrophobic actioner and two, the mobile a-b-c-z thriller. I didn't have a problem with McClane running around from town to town because you can't carry on reusing the hostage premise.On paper, the storyline looked weak - McClane vs. computer nerds didn't sound that great and their dastardly plot just didn't appeal to me. However, I thought the film did well to show the kind of dependency we have on computers and how we'd be lost without them. The film came across as Die Hard 3- meets -Enemy of the State, with bad guys pulling up every detail and piece of surveillance possible to track their targets. This made the villain slightly more interesting, when it later shows what kind of danger he holds. My other concern was the sidekick aspect. While Samuel L Jackson was good in the last film, the idea of McClane having to protect a geeky kid was worrying. But once again, my fear was quickly removed when Justin Long (despite that awful radio scene) gave a good performance, especially in his comic timing.While the plot surprised me, the pace kind of dragged to a halt at times. The tech talk will either go over your head or be drilled into it, having been repeated over and over again. Also, the film has a sanitised feel about it, with muted colours and steel/glass interiors, taking away the rawness that McClane is better suited to. The climax was my main disappointment though - after witnessing some amazing action set-pieces I expected good things from the final face-off. Instead, we get the lamest villain-dispatch in the series (even worse than the tacked-on DH3 ending).On the whole, I was still impressed by the movie - and the action. The Die Hard films have been memorable for including insane stunts ever since the fire-hose jump. In Die Hard 2 the ejector seat was the money shot whereas in 3 it was the car chase. This time, we are treated to some of the best in the series. Even a shootout in an apartment manages to be more entertaining than it should be. Later on, there are some jaw-dropping stunts as McClane uses a number of vehicles to take out... well, other vehicles. The visuals are fantastic and the fighter plane vs. truck sequence looks very cool. While the blood has been toned down, there is lots punishment dealt out. In fact, everyone is super-durable in the film - getting constantly hit by cars, falling great heights and getting up afterwards.But also, there is plenty of humour. This is where it probably beats DH2, which had faults that crippled the film (awful dialogue, dopey characters). There are plenty of great one-liners which got a good reception at the cinema I went to. The performances are also very good, with Long likable, Willis on form (obviously) and the villain Olyphant playing the detached type rather well.Overall, the film IS a Die Hard because it keeps the three elements in tact, all the way through: eye-popping action, juicy one-liners and of course, Bruce Willis.",7,2,4,5 July 2007
300," Visually stunning, completely shallow but solid entertainment!
","'300' is one of the most famous underdog stories (next to Rocky) ever told, recounting the Battle of Thermopylae where 300 Spartans held off the entire Persian Empire.First off, let's just put things into perspective. This film is based on the graphic novel, which itself was based on the film 'The 300 Spartans' which was then based on the event. In other words, 300 is very much removed from historical accuracy and should not be approached if thats what you're expecting.Told from the perspective of Dilios, a Spartan soldier/messenger, the film is given the freedom to embellish and exaggerate as much as possible. Therefore, as the battles go on, each one is more and more OTT featuring everything from chained-mutant-giants to bomb-throwing magicians. In fact, you get the feeling that the film is constantly trying to out-do the last set-piece. As a result, the pace rarely lets up until the last 20 minutes or so where political aspects take over.On a technical level, the film is a masterpiece and a real assault on the senses. From the booming opening logos, to the epic-choral soundtrack, the film sets out to impress. And it does. Just about every shot in 300 could be framed and put up on your wall, it looks that good. The film is a series of iconic images that range from a tree covered in dead bodies to fleets of Persian ships being smashed in a storm.Finally, while most of the dialogue is pretty dodgy and there is very little depth to 300, the film is carried well by Gerard Butler as King Leonidas who's performance convinces as a man who you wouldn't wanna cross, but would follow to certain death.There are plenty of flaws to 300, but I think it comes down to what you expect from a film that was quite clearly advertised as a visual spectacle more than anything.",7,4,11,30 March 2007
