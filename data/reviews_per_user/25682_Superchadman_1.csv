The Avengers," The greastest film ever made
","I went into this movie with such high hopes, I have been looking forward to it for so long now. Not one second of this movie was disappointing, it was incredible, funny the action was incredible. I love Robert Downey, he as iron man is excellent, but I'm pleased to say that The Hulk stole the show. I really recommend this film not just to people who like this type of film but anyone who enjoys all type of film. It's awesome, just are black widow in that suit!! All of the characters get great screen time, and all of them feel in place, no one is left out and the character development is something to congratulate Whedon on. This film has everything in it, and I was so surprised by the humour because it wasn't cheesy, it was well done and clever, I look forward to the sequel! I do however feel sorry for Nolan, for his film should be overshadowed by this film, in fact all films this year should be. I might just go see it again. All of you should, such an achievement, credit Joss Whedon...bravo. And now that I have put spoilers, just wanna say, Hulk Vs Loki was one of the greatest scenes ever. Just pay to watch that scene and that merely will be worth the money.",10,5,13,29 April 2012
