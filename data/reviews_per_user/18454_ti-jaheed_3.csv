Vertigo," Overrated and out of film-logic
","This movie seems illogical from many perspectives. I normally skip not a single second of a movie except in the case of this one. It contains some random characters, nearly no story, top to bottom poor in terms of logic. It felt like let abandon watching this movie after 2/3. But quickly thought to add another count to my watched movies list. However, disappointed by the high rating.",6,0,4,21 March 2018
Sicario," I don't know what the director wanted to show!
","Look, I have watched as many drug, gangster, ops movies to comment worthily that this movie falls into no class. It keeps you waiting and waiting without giving you what's going on. The director raised the tension from the very beginning, but disappointed the viewer by leaving them blank, without a clue. Music seems to be very tension-raising... but no points to be tensed about. Screenplay tries to allude so much that it misses the main point right away. Nothing's clarified. Not a clue. You remain clueless till the end. Equations doesn't hold.
Could have been a masterpiece, however.",1,1,3,20 September 2019
Mystic River," Not up to the mark
","Loved the tone and mood of the movie at first. 
But it's a sub-optimal direction from Clint Eastwood. Looks like characters know many 'little things' beforehand to pave the way to solve the case. 
Eastwood did a bad job. But not as bad as the Oscar board.",5,0,1,26 July 2018
