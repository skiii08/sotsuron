Blade Runner 2049," Totally disappointed
","It's been awhile since i see such a bad film. Studio throw too much budget on marketing this thing. If you can please invest such money to the film, it would be better. Lousy trailer, Worth sound, bad acting, the worst film story ever and the theme is so dark that you just don't want to live in the future anymore",1,24,49,7 October 2017
