The Avengers," Closest movie to the comics...
","wow 8,8 is truly sky high for a an action flick. But it deserves it..Have seen this movie twice...and it gets better the second time around because you can really enjoy the action.The best thing of this movie is the way they are able to put such a high degree of a comic book feel to it. It's almost perfect. A major weakness to the movie is the 3D effects and watching it in Imax is a major waste of money. The movie was turned into Imax and added 3d effects to get extra cash...but it's truly disappointing.So be warned...cant avoid 3d, but the Imax version should be avoided. Save the money.To the characters Hawkeye doesn't come out so great. Lack of arrows...not a problem in the comics, but on screen it felt quite sad. Also the fight scenes(h2h) with a bow is kinda forced and not so greatly choreographed. (maybe an idea to get Yuen Woo Ping next time to choreograph some nice fighting moves for him)Cant complain about black Widow and Scarlet Johansson. She is always a treat to watch...but like Hawkeye she doesn't have any superpowers. The feeling i have is...during the fight scenes...does she have any chance at all? To me it feels like toddlers fighting along with Marines in a real war. No chance at all.I still don't like Thor. He is always a favorite in the comics...but on screen he is just not so impressive. But most of the characters are great. Iron man and RDjr are great as usual. iron man is much much better on screen than in the comics. Always felt he was kinda boring on paper...but RDjr has build such a character around him. Incredible....truly masterful how he has able to interpret this character and build him up. And the humor he has instilled in iron-man and the other movies are i think a great influence in this movie too.Probably the best character here is the Hulk. Sure Ruffalo doesn't disappoint as banner. But lets face it...who cares. Its about the HULK. And this time he has been portrayed perfectly. There are two hulk characters...the brilliant scientist and mindless monster version. This version has been on big and small screens most of the time and is getting really boring and we have seen all the different stories of this. Than banner is important. In avengers we see the second version...Hulk the super hero. And i love this version. matter of fact...to me Hulk had some of the best scenes of the movie.Captain America to me has the most depth. Remember the standalone captain America movie is about the beginning of Cap's story. In this movie we see how he struggles adjusting to the new world and age. It's just a small bit...but it's so interesting. Evans does a great job. So stiff and to good to be true. But thats Cap America. Hope they will make a new movie. Frankly the Cap America story is getting better the older it gets, because the differences are getting bigger and bigger. He is part of the 1940s generation. Part of the one in a life time generation that made a country great and set the stage for US dominance. When he wakes up...it's a different USA. We might even say...a USA thats in its decline as a world power. Anyway it's a great movie and I think deserves its high marks. Give him a 9 out of 10....3d is weak and Imax a waste of money.",9,2,6,12 May 2012
The Monuments Men," hmm to unbelievable...
",Well it was not as expected. Thinking abit of fantasy caper like oceans 11. Instead was an almost documentary. But in such away that its not believable.Love the story. But it was shown in such haphazard way. Seems the adventures in the book was collected and divided amongst the few actors involved. COme on.8 people did all of this? I cant believe it.Well at least its making me buy the book.And read how it all happened. Because for sure it's a story I never realised before.I love florence...didn't even realise it was destroyed. Surprising to see the paintings stolen that they recovered. And Now I can enjoy seeing them..never realising what they came thru.I have a feeling that something went wont with the filming. Sad the story deserved better. A huge misser for clooney.And people saying whats the use...this story is still relevant. Remember Al Qaeda destroying the statues in Afghanistan. Its not about the Nazis..it s about the sort of people they are. And sadly such kind of people still exists.,6,0,0,21 February 2014
The Hunger Games," The movie is even better after reading the book...
","I saw the movie before reading the book.After I saw the movie I quickly read the trilogy. I must say the movie is even better after reading the book. that's not something I can say very often.To be honest watching a movie first and learning the characters first of course colors the persons when you read the book. Is like you have idea how they look. So that's a plus. But the characters and atmosphere in the movie are true to the book. I truly appreciate how they are able to portray the subtleties of the book in the movie.It's a great story and it will only get better in the following books. So go for the movie. The ranking is really to low.One thing I never understood how this movie is just pg 13. It shows a massacre of young children that's quite disturbing to me. I have read the trilogy and this story is just the tip of the ice berg. But why is sex unacceptable for pg13, but violence as shown is acceptable. Maybe the civilization in the books/ movie is closer to us than we would want.",9,1,6,12 May 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Reboot failure...
","First of all I love the original spiderman. Tobey Maguire is great as spidey/Peter Parker. Even though the films are quite dated now with regards to special effects...it followed the story i know about spiderman much better than this movie.The sad part is...it uses plenty of elements from the original story but they simply jumbled up the plot and worked it out quite badly storywise. So it is quite disappointing. I mean the scene how Uncle Ben dies....is quite silly. How PP gets bitten by the spider....not as good as the original. How he confesses to being Spiderman so quickly.I was quite shocked that this is a marvel movie and also endorsed by Stan Lee. I mean spideys beginning is a classic story, just like Batman and Superman's. You can do reboots...but YOU MUST NOT CHANGE THE BASIC PRINCIPLES. And if you change it a bit...it must do the original story justice.To bad really because it started quite interesting and the special effects are awesome and a huge improvement over the original series. Like the suit and also that he has to reload his webs. I guess they tried to explain how Spidey learns how to go webslinging. But wasn't worked out to well. The cast are mainly quite good...only Peter Parker is not that great. PP is a nerd, who turns into a smart aleck superhero when he wears his suit. The difference now is not that great. Tobey maguire did it much better.Also again 3d was quite disappointing. Right now i feel 3d is just a money making machine and a way to protect the movies vs piracy. The colours are truly effected by wearing the 3d glasses and thats quite a pity.IMO if you do 3d...make it look goodm, a true asset to the movie. i wont have problems paying extra for it.So my conclusion it's quite entertaining movie, but lower your expectations and you won't be to disappointed.",4,5,12,1 July 2012
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Leaves you wanting for more....
","Something for Disney to learn here. This sequel is amazing. And true world-building. Not just a question of earning extra money.Dreamworks don't have the animation stars like Disney. But they are slowly building up a great collection. If Disney don't watch out...they are going to be overtaken by Dreamworks. To be honest..I don't understand why Disney is making such bad sequels. All they have to to is make a new storyline and some hard work making animation and they have a new movie. No need thinking up new characters or worlds.Strategy is simple...world-building and great sequels. After Shrek, it didn't comes as a big surprise with Dragon 2. But what didn't surprise me was the depth of the world and all the different dragons. To be honest cant wait for the next sequel.",9,7,14,15 July 2014
Frozen," What a lovely film and song...
",I love Disney movies. And while watching the movie reminded me of my two little nieces. A movie about sisters.I hope they don't befell the same tragedy(knock on wood). But hope their relationship would be just as great. A must have for my Disney collection for them. I guess for now they are a bit to young for it.Awesome comedy from the snowman. Like the lion king it has emotional value that touches young and old. Making it one of Disney best in a long time. Where Lion King is about a father and a son. This is about sisters. And add the great song 'let it go'...without me knowing a song you hum when walking out of the cinema.,9,4,8,21 February 2014
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The least satisfying episode
","It was a long sit, but in the end it felt so unsatisfying. Almost like a waste of time. The previous 3 episodes I have read the book and the movies didn't disappoint at all. But this time the movie was a disappointment. It felt so disjointed...seems like they tried to put in as many parts of the book in the movie. If this movie is part of the doubleheader...I must say this movie was the least satisfying movie-episode since Star wars part 1.Even though the visuals were stunning...you weren't able to engross yourself inside the movie.6 out of 10 because it was such a disappointment.",6,1,1,19 December 2005
Prometheus," Most disappointing movie 2012
","How can this movie receive such a high rating? This movie should be a sort of prequel to the whole aliens saga. Giving us extra insight to the alien universe. Instead its become the worse prequel since Star Wars 1. Matter of fact ... compared to Prometheus SW1 is a masterpiece.The role of the heroine is a bit like a reboot of Ripley...down to how she looks, acts and what she wears. I mean couldn't Ridley Scott try to be a little more original here? Even the Plot seems eerily similar with the android with its own agenda. this plot has been used time and time again.Anyway when the movie ended I had more questions...not because its story and plot was so great and interesting. But everything is just simply full of holes that the whole movie seems like a HUGE waste of money.Awful movie...no logic involved in the story, plot or scenario. Serious lack of originality.Conclusion...wait for the second movie....on Bluray, than you can watch both movies. If there is no sequel...just ignore it and you can thank me that i have saved you hours of your life that could be used for something better...like watching Star wars episode 1...using slow motion when Jar jar binks comes up.",1,46,77,1 July 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," A perfect ending to a landmark trilogy
","A perfect ending to one of the great trilogies ever. Easily top 4 with Godfather, Starwars and of course LOTR.The movie was so good....simply blew me away like with Avatar. Something i didn't expect at all. It even caused spontaneous applause after its finish...in Holland thats really not the norm.I think Batman, the most human of the superheroes is portrayed here perfectly by Bale. Someone who has given his all and more, is required to do it all again. WOW. It was done so well...you sympathize and even pity him. Adding a layer to the Batman Saga that I won't soon forget.All the actors were spot on and gave brilliant performances. Able to add a human touch to there acting making it all believable and quite unforgettable. After Ledger's Joker, Hardy's Bane is the perfect followup villain. Totally different and it just works. Hardy must be one of the premiere physical actors ever. Just using his voice, body and posture to create so much menace is incredible to behold. Anne Hathaway as cat-woman is the best of the 3 versions on film. Halle Berry is still the hottest one, but hath aways is the most interesting and she gave it all her own twist and i simply like her version a lot. But my favorite is somehow Joseph Gordon Levitt...he is portrayed as the truest hero without the taints unlike the others and in the end it all makes perfect sense.Of course the movie is not perfect. Somehow even lasting nearly 3 hours it could have used more time. Somehow it seems to shortchange the story.The time passing by while the city was held hostage or being conquered with the suffering and desperation of the city and its populace was not so evident. The weather change was the only indication of the time passing by. Maybe a montage scene would be a good idea here.:)",10,6,13,22 July 2012
The Hangover Part III," Trilogy?!?....just simply turning a quick buck. A con-movie.
",To me it seems they borrowed a plot from another movie/script and replaced the characters with the ones from hangover 1..to get It's purely trying to milk out the characters for as much of our money as possible. Realising they have run out of ideas for a similar hangover movie. They just borrowed a script somewhere and try to cash in on its famous predecessors. A quick heists before people realize what the movie actually is. A con movie.The funniest bit is the Giraffe sequence...but thats only at the start...not even part of the actual movie. Simply an amuse bouche.The rest of the movie doesn't have any hangovers in it or really any comedic moments. Just a straight crime-caper trying to be funny.Sad sad end and showing the true colors of the makers and participants of this movie.,1,13,22,2 June 2013
