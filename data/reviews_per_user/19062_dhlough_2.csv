Lucky Number Slevin," MacGuffins
","Lucky Number Slevin  no, that's not a typo  will easily be dismissed as Tarantino-esquire. Starring Josh Hartnett as the unlucky title character, the film has more twists and turns than a high-tech roller-coaster, but it's just as much fun (and almost as immediately forgettable).Directed with breakneck technique by Paul McGuigan from a clever though highly implausible script by Jason Slimovic, the film is cast, with one minor exception, impeccably. It marks the first role that justifies Josh Hartnett's hype, and bestows Lucy Liu the most normal  and incandescent  part of her career. It's a bonus that they have palpable on-screen chemistry, as well as great foils in the guise of Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman (though Ben Kingsley's high-strung performance as The Rabbi is a miscalculation). The film itself is stylized  written in high gumshoe/screwball mode, with a guided tour of ugly wallpapers throughout history as part of its hard-boiled milieu  though the actors' convictions root the topsy-turvy narrative in recognizable human terrain.At its best, Lucky Number Slevin has the feel of a minor John Huston caper directed, with prankish glee, by Brian DePalma. It's a blood-revenge thriller with no depth, though there are reservoirs of feeling in Hartnett's and Liu's performances, as well as wit. Liu seems to the screwball manor born. And Hartnett prances around for nearly 30 minutes of screen time in nothing more than a long purple towel and a quizzical expression. He's such a game actor that his performance is both a put-on and homage to the long line of Macguffins in film noir. With, of course, a twist.",7,32,64,23 June 2006
Hostel," Effective Little Gross-Out
","Eli Roth's Hostel isn't a very good film, nor is it  in its genre  all that imaginative. But it's effective, intermittently engaging and, above all, very satisfying.Two Americans  the cocky Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and the broken-hearted Josh (Derek Richardson)  are backpacking across Europe with an Icelandic pick-up, the party-hard Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson). Stuck in Amsterdam, and bored with the influx of Americans, they meet the bug-eyed (or is that cross-eyed?) Slav Alex (Lubomir Bukovy, with the freaky presence of a young Marty Feldman). He entices them to head to Slovakia, where the women are all supermodels and will screw you just because of your foxy American accent. So off they go, soon in the clutches of babes who bed them, drug them, and sell them to an organization that allows you  with the right amount of cash  to kill another human being.A film like Hostel lives and dies by its concept. This movie's queasy set up is a doozy. Roth takes his time getting his entertaining trio to Slovakia, and the camaraderie of men in pursuit of cheap thrills and cheaper women feels right. The scenes in the murder factory aren't as gross as the ads would have you believe  you grow immune to the shock fast, and reminisce about the more ingenious gross-outs of Saw. Yet the last thirty minutes are everything a horror movie should be: tense, funny, and insanely reliant on crazy twists of fate that are never less than satisfying to an audience.And Hostel is a film that requires an audience: one that shouts, groans, and laughs at the sheer giddy high of more bloodshed and its attendant acts of revenge. The best revenge may come from the spike (pun intended) in travel to the countries of Eastern Europe; regardless of the carnage (and the pus and the gristle), there isn't one ounce of cellulite on its women.",6,0,0,23 June 2006
