Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Need a more sophisticated plot
","Who can doubt the power of the force?  Star Wars is indubitably one of Earth's greatest treasures of the 20th century.  From the first Star Wars in 1977 to the last of the first trilogy in 1984, Lucas has proven himself to be among the greatest film artists in history.  I, for one, had great expectation in the latest episode of his space saga.  However, this one--The Phantom Menace--though with outlandish CGI special effects and superstar casts, lacks the glory that the previous three SW films have left behind.All I can say about the greatness of this movie is the special effects. Nothing else.  Sorry.First, I'd like to criticize Lucas' inaptitude in script-writing.  There are many obvious faux-pas lines that ruin the show. (e.g. Jar Jar Binks: 'You sa you sa...people are gonna die-ei?',  Anakin Skywalker: 'Mom, you said the problem of the universe is that nobody helps each other. [followed by long pause]', Obi-wan Kenobi: 'I have a bad feeling about this.')Dude, what the hell?  I'd prefer these lines not to be uttered at all. There is absolutely no immediate need for them to be expressed, dammit!Second, one character I really hated: Jar Jar Binks.  If he were there to substitute Chewbacca, I'd say, 'Damn, George, bring back the growling, rifle-shooting, sound-and-fury Wookie!!  In TPM, JJB is not shy to demonstrate his clumsiness at any time.  His stupid, unheroic appearance in the movie only makes the flick worse.  Indeed, he has introduced many comical elements into the film, but damn, man, this is SW!  It's not supposed to be a Disney film!  We don't need to see his tripping and fumbling during the battle scene.  It totally ruins the intensity.Third, Anakin Skywalker as a Christ figure.  Okay, as we all are well aware of, young Anakin will eventually emerge as the dark lord known as Darth Vader.  If Lucas is aware of that Anakin is the ultimate bad guy of the galaxy, why would he illustrate him as the savior???  Born from immaculate conception, protagonist of the chariot (pod) race??  Maybe I'm a little slow, but I don't remember that, in the Bible, Jesus will turn to the dark side.Fourth, Ewan McGregor.  When I watched him in Trainspotting, I immediately realized this dude can be no less than the protagonist of any film.  But here in TPM, he's a yes-man, lap dog; his brilliance is completely hidden behind his master, played by the poise Liam Nieeson.  Only until the very last scene is Ewan standing alone and exuberating the Jedi power.  What a waste of him in the first episode.Fifth, the accidental saving the day.  Anakin, again, a 9-year-old kid with supernatural power (Jedi potential), by chance goes hiding inside the fighter plane canopy.  He, by chance, activates the plane, by chance, wipes out the formidable obstacles, by chance, flys to the space, by chance, participates in the outer space dog-fight, by chance, lands inside the Trade Federation's space station, by chance, fires at a crucial spot that subsequently destroys the entire space station; he, by chance, is the savior of the day.  You gotta do better than that, Lucas.Sixth, ground battle.  The primitive Gungans vs. the high-tech equipped Trade Federation armies.  Surprisingly enough, the Gungans receive the ultimate victory in the battle.  Man, what are the odds?  And the clumsy JJB survives the lazer cross-firing battlefield.  One of the lamest scenes is that when JJB accidentally diabled a TF robot, from which his leg gets entangled with, and in attempt to get rid of the clinging robot, he accidentally kills three more TF robots (for the robot on his leg fires at the TF robots whenever he flings his leg).  All I can say is WTF.I'm tired of counting the no-goods for this movie.  Nevertheless, I'm amazed how the movie technology has created such eye-popping effects in this movie, which is really exhilarating.  I give this credit to Lucas and all the crew in Lucasfilm.  They really deserve this.I'm sure many of you die-hard SW fans beg to differ, and might want to kill me in the next 24 hours.  Fortunately, I'm scrupulous enough not to include my email address here with my comment.  Haha...",Null,0,1,22 May 1999
