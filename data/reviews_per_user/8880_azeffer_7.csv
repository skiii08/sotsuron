Black Swan," This swan was superb
","I saw Black Swan and it was without a doubt the most superb film I have seen in recent memory.It was perfectly paced. The acting was tremendous. The plot captivated from the beginning. It was visually spectacular and stylized very, very well. It made me think of how fragile the human mind can be, and how often we are our own worst enemy.In short it had it all - and was not a piece of garbage like so many films made these days.I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a well-crafted film. Natalie Portman gave an Oscar worthy performance. Barbara Hershey was the quintessential passive-aggressive controlling stage mother with the right hint of bitterness. Also Oscar worthy. Mila Kunis was impressive. Nice to see Winona Ryder is a small but pivotal and role that stood out. And the guy who played the ballet director was perfectly creepy.",10,9,18,12 December 2010
The Ring," Didn't scare me, but it sure annoyed me
","This movie isn't horrible, but it is a clear rip off on many levels from the Sixth Sense.  For starters, the spooked out and somber little boy with the glazed eyes - a clear rip off.  The thing about the tape was interesting, but it bugged me.  I wanted to know more, like what the hell was so wrong with this freakish girl Samara who was so wretched the mother had to push her down a well.  And Samara supposedly died in 1978.  So why the hell was the mother wearing a laced up Victorian dress when she tossed her in? 
Finally, this last point really bugged me.  What the hell is a little kid like that calling his mother 'Rachel' for?  Is that supposed to be cool or something? That this supposed tough, hardened, independent, career-driven single mother insists on having her kid call her by her first name?  That made me want to vomit.  I know it sounds petty, but for somereason it really, really irritated me.  It was like they were trying to make the mom cool, like they were trying to make this movie cool.Instead of being scared I was annoyed.  if you want to be scared, try The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, or Helter Skelter - a true story that will have you shivering.",Null,0,1,4 May 2003
Erin Brockovich," Inspirational and Important
","After viewing this film I have a whole new respect for Julia Roberts.  I have always thought most of her films have been vacuous and sappy (but for the most part I can't stand romantic comedy no matter who is in it).  This movie is inspirational and touching without any cliches or same old formula. Julia's performance as Erin illustrates the frustration and hardships of an individual who feels trapped and devalued by society due to lack of skills and opportunity.  The rest of the cast is superb as well, especially Albert Finney.And what an amazing story.  Erin is a woman to be admired.  As someone who is concerned with our environment, I hope this movie helps to raise peoples awareness of environmental health.  Not only toxic water, but air pollution, increased asthma, climate change, etc.I'd be glad to see this movie grab awards.  They would be well deserved.",Null,1,1,20 January 2001
Alien," Brilliant. Gritty. Chilling.
","A great representation of our gritty and ruthless industrialized world in the future.  Worn out and tired crew waiting to return home encounter a deadly creature that leads to their destruction, all in the the name of the comapnies greed.  Sound familiar?  Not too far from our world of today at all.Weaver is magnificent, the scene where she flips out at Ash and slams him against the wall is brilliant.  Holm was so convincing as Ash, the droid who leads the crew to their destruction that I wanted to hit him throughout the whole film.  And the rest of the supporting cast, such as Cartwright and Skerrit pleading to be let back into the ship as the carry Cane with the disgusting creature attached to him are great as well.A classic.",Null,0,1,31 May 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," entertaining, but not all that brilliant
","I was amused by  the film and thought it was interesting how most of the action is centered around female characters (a la Xena, Charlie's Angels, etc.) and the cinematography was beautiful.But the story is rather childish.  I was really annoyed at how everyone kept giving that bratty girl Jen more chances to clean her act up when she had no respect for anyone, whether it be her lover, Jade Fox, or the warrior couple.  If these warriors were so smart, why did they keep giving her more chances?  She was so irritating and petulant I wish someone would have killed her already, and smashed her stupid comb while they were at it.
And since when can martial arts experts fly like Peter Pan?!  The whole time I was watching that all I could think about was Tinkerbell. That really ruined a lot of the fight scenes.If you want to see quality Chinese films, check out 'Farewell My Concubine' and 'Raise The Red Lantern'.  But most of the viewers here won't - because lets face it, it is men who like the special effects.I'd say it gets six stars.",Null,0,0,2 January 2001
Cloud Atlas," I loved it
","I thought it was exceptional. Very telling about humanity. The performances were amazing. Very touching. And I did not think it was convoluted or hard to follow at all. If anything, I thought it was a feat. I hope that the film will get more exposure than it has. It is a movie that is very telling about humanity, and sometimes humans just don't want to face the truth about humanity. There were touches of comedy with the tale of the old publisher. And there were also hints of other famous films. The story of the server girl slave had hints of the film Soylent Green. And I thought that the storyline of the 1970s reporter was a bit remnant of Silkwood. It was amazing how everything seemed to weave together.",10,3,10,13 November 2012
Atonement," Superb Triumph
","Gripping, heart wrenching, thoughtful, and pieced together brilliantly. Notice the subtle nuances of the filmmaker, how Cecilia's foot slips out of her shoe during the love scene in the library, or the piece of china sinking to the bottom of the fountain. The depiction of war is perhaps one of the most accurate in recent history, bringing the horror to full effect. This provoking story gives everyone pause to reflect on the fanciful lies that children can tell, and the havoc they rake. The acting is perfection. Sheer artistry. The chemistry between the two leads lends a great deal to the believability. The scene of their reunion in the tea shop, where Robby moves his hand is so telling.Bravo to everyone involved.",10,3,6,23 December 2007
