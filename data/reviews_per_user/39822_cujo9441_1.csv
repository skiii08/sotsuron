The Benchwarmers," More Than Just Comedy:: Moral
","This is the story of three grown men playing internet broad-casted games as The Benchwarmers against 4 or 5 different teams of Bullies.David Spade (Richie) plays a Smart-mouthed scaredy-cat that plays to impress a lovely lady fan of the Benchwarmers. John Heder (Clark) plays a dorky lovable mama's boy who needs to get out more. & Rob Schneider (Gus) plays a tough guy who carries the team who fights (plays baseball) for all the poor nerds that never got to before, so that his kid will someday be free from bullies.The movie contains some crude humor so be aware when taking small children, but otherwise this is a Hilarious story of the way that life should be, not that it will change, but still so that adults see how truly cruel children can be.I loved this movie, I laughed hard but lets not miss the message.Enjoy!",9,46,90,8 April 2006
