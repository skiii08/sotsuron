Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Waste of time
","Terrible. I am a fan of horror films especially ghost stories and those with creepy atmosphere. Unfortunately this one is not even close to that. Every vampire film from 70' s or before no matter how small budget it had was far better than this. This one feels more like a comedy than vampire film. It is basically a non stop action film with almost no horror elements at all. Like John Wick with an axe. No atmosphere, no story, with cliched characters and bad CGI it looks completely artificial and cartoonish. Terrible camerawork, color grading changes from scene to scene, (people are sometimes white, sometimes yellow and then green or pink), amateurish direction etc. Avoid.",2,0,0,15 June 2020
