Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good Movie (but not ground breaking or profound)
","If you are looking to see an exciting action/sci-fi movie with great special effects you won't be disappointed.  If you want subtle plotting, believable dialog, and insightful characterization; or a Great Movie with a profound message, go rent Twelve Angry Men or somesuch.On the whole, very well done, but I have two major gripes (don't worry, no spoilers here):1) Dialog via exposition: at times it is painfully to the obvious that the characters aren't talking to each other, but talking directly to the audience, filling them in on what they need to know.  This gives a stilted, unnatural meter to every conversation, the script's dialog could have used a great deal of polish.2) Annoying kiddie focus: this is not as bad as was rumored, but a lot of the movie seems to be targetted exclusively at those not old enough to know how to write in cursive.  A goofy, clumsy alien sidekick with a shrill ET-goes-Jamaican voice is provided.  Fairly annoying, but fortunately this only mildly detracts from the picture.IT'S GOOD THOUGH.  I like to complain because it's easier than being positive.  SW:TPM is a very good movie when all is said and done.  I especially like how Senator Palpitine was portrayed.",8,0,0,21 May 1999
