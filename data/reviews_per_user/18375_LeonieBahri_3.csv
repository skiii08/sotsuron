Marie Antoinette," This movie really stayed with me...
","The whole time I was watching Sofia Coppola's take on the famously ill-fated Queen of France I felt like I was missing something. This came close to hampering my enjoyment of the film, but I must admit that it was this sensation that has caused my mind to linger over the aims and intentions of the film long after I left the screening. Coppola has taken a decidedly idiosyncratic stance on Marie Antoinette's years as a monarch at Versailles, and her youthful, teen-aged approach to her subject goes quite some way to reclaiming a much-maligned character.Kirsten Dunst is transfixing as Marie Antoinette, and the film is relentlessly focused on her performance; mirroring the intense focus of the French Aristocracy on their new monarch. There are some great supporting performances (Rip Torn and Asia Argento amuse as the old King and his common lover) and some not-so-great (Jason Schwartzman - an actor I love - is somewhat miscast as the shyly impotent Louis XVI) but what is important is that the support remains as support, never distracting from Dunst's stellar performance.Filmed on location at Versailles, the film has a rivetingly lavish style overflowing in elegance, but never more beautiful than in the sequence where the Queen sets up her own self- consciously romantic idyll in the form of a rustic village in the grounds of the palace. One of the key criticisms levelled at the historical Marie Antoinette is her extravagant spending in the face of the poverty of the French People and the debt of the monarchy itself. This is the one accusation that it is hardest to answer in defence of Marie Antoinette, and yet in displaying the lush surroundings of Versailles in such minutely sublime detail, Coppola makes it obvious how hard it must have been for a girl of such a young age to align in her mind the warnings of the financial state of her country given her by her husband and ministers with the supremely extravagant lifestyle led by all at court. Sofia Coppola brings to the story of Marie Antoinette a vibrancy that is rarely seen in period dramas, and her decision to focus solely on the years at Versailles and not dwell on the path well travelled by dragging on to the Queen's well-documented fate will leave you pondering the social justice meted out to her and her family by the French Revolution.",7,4,13,12 September 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," A Winner of a movie about Losers
","A dysfunctional family takes a road trip in a run down VW van so that the 7 year old daughter can participate in the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant, and along the way they learn about themselves, each other, and change their perceptions on life in general. Sounds about as good as Hope Floats or National Lampoon's European Vacation, right? But this is dysfunction taken to extremes and dealt with with just the right balance of humour and sensitivity, and so a movie that could veer dangerously close to schmaltz and sentimentality instead reins itself in, becoming as deeply funny as it is moving.The family that squeeze themselves into that van comprises of Sheryl (Tonie Collette), working mother and sole breadwinner; Richard (Greg Kinnear), her husband and wannabe motivational speaker; Sheryl's brother Frank (Steve Carrel), a gay, pre-eminent Proust scholar who's just failed in a suicide attempt; Sheryl's son, Dwayne (Paul Dano), who, inspired by Nietszche, has taken a vow of silence until he's accepted to train as an fighter pilot; Richard's father (Alan Arkin), an oversexed pensioner experimenting with heroin; and Sheryl and Richard's daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin), a beauty queen obsessed 7 year old with a truly idiosyncratic fashion sense.These descriptions may sound like a ragbag collection of depressed caricatures, but the performances by the cast prevent it from lapsing into emotional parody, and truly a star is born in the form of Abigail Breslin to whom this movie entirely belongs. Surrounded by veteran scene stealers like Collette, Carrel and Arkin, she effortlessly transcends the film in possibly the most honest performance a child actor has ever delivered on screen. Her bemusement at her despicable father's sneering dietary insinuations when she orders ice cream for breakfast and subsequent lack of appetite almost made me cry.This movie is painfully truthful and yet shockingly funny, and just when it seems it couldn't get any bleaker, it suddenly swings round and turns out to be the ultimate feel good movie.",7,4,8,12 September 2006
Rosemary's Baby," Scarily Brilliant
","This movie means so much to me. It is exceptional in every sense of the word. It is a film that demands to be viewed more than once, and unlike most horror movies, where repeated viewing dulls the experience, this film only becomes more terrifying as you watch it again and again getting more and more caught up in the conspiracy that surrounds Rosemary.Mia Farrow is the living, breathing heart of this movie. Appearing in every scene, her delicate portrayal of the beautifully innocent Rosemary Wodehouse provides a stark opposition to the disturbing nature of the movie's true subject. How she didn't win 1968's Best Actress Oscar is beyond me, let alone the fact that she wasn't even nominated.Polanski's obsession with imbuing the mundane with sinister qualities has never been more effective than in this, his masterpiece (some may argue Chinatown or Repulsion as deserving that title, but Rosemary's Baby takes it simply for the way it manipulates its audience at the same time as forcing them to become emotionally involved in a truly outlandish plot). He is aided here by the film's setting, the creepy Bramford. The film begins with a long-shot of the New York skyline. Komeda's eerily melodic lullaby is being sweetly sung over the pink curly credits by Mia Farrow as the camera eventually settles on the Gothic Bramford building, nestled malevolently amongst the innocuous houses and apartment complexes of modern New York City. As the newlyweds Guy and Rosemary settle in to their newly purchased apartment it becomes increasingly obvious that every step Rosemary takes in search of a modern domestic bliss is in fact sucking her in to a nightmarishly evil scenario beyond her imagination.Farrow is ably supported by the wonderful Ruth Gordon as the sinisterly over-solicitous next door neighbour and John Cassavetes (who famously clashed with Polanski onset) as her devilishly handsome actor husband. But Farrow is the star, and the year IS 1966, so although we never get to lay eyes on the eponymous baby, our thoughts are never far from him, his deceived mother and, of course, the lurking presence of his father.",10,4,6,12 September 2006
