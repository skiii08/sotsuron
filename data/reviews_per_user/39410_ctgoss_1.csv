The Blair Witch Project," Easily the worst movie I've ever seen
","*POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT*Despite all the hype & critical praise, Blair Witch Project is hands down the worst movie I've ever seen (& I've seen LOTS of bad ones of all Genres). Easily makes Plan Nine From Outer Space look like Citizen Kane in comparison. Basic pretense is 3 obnoxious documentary film-makers go in search of an urban legend. They camp in the woods & complain & argue for most of the film & nothing else happens. You will want for these extremely grating alterna-hippies to get offed about 5 minutes into this tragic waste of celluloid. About as exciting as watching cheese melt or paint dry. The blurbs for the film stated 'More terrifying than the Texas Chainsaw Massacre & the Exorcist combined'. I've seen episodes of Scooby Doo that were scarier,  & pornos that had better plots & character development. If you want to see a truly disturbing psychological horror film, watch Repulsion or Peeping Tom. If you want to see a scary supernatural film with innovative cinematography, rent Suspiria or Kwaidan. While no great shakes itself, the much maligned sequel is a million times better & more entertaining movie. Skip this one unless you need a cure for insomnia. Minus a million billion stars.",1,3,6,6 February 2003
