The Avengers," avengers over rated
","If you haven't seen any of the other movies such as, Thor, Iron Man, The Hulk, or Captain America, then this movie will have you lost. It does not give you enough background information to understand some of the film. For instance, when Natasha Romanoff says to Agent Phil Coulson that she didn't want to bring Tony Stark better known as Iron Man into Headquarters because Tony didn't, 'trust her as far as he could throw her' I wonder to myself, 'why doesn't he trust her?' and the question is never answered throughout the film. Along with the scene when Agent Phil Coulson and Thor are standing in front of a computer with a young blonde women's profile opened and the Agent tells Thor that he got her out of the country to keep her out of danger during the battle to come. The movie does not explain why she is important to Thor and it doesn't explain who she is. The characters do not mesh together and the acting his horrible. The scene that Captain America is in a plane with Agent Coulson, the acting is horrible and the dialogue with the intended humor is bland. My first time watching the film, I paid more attention to the special effects and I do give credit that producer Joss Whedon and his crew did a decent job with that. But the second time watching the film, I focused on the characters and plot and I was not impressed. The movie has no surprises in it, the fighting scene in the end is dull and drags on and the ending result of the fight is not only predictable, but clich√©d. I do not believe this movie deserved an 8.7 rating because for a two and a half hour movie, it does more dull action scenes then character explanation and background that it needs to make the viewer fully understand what is even going on between all the characters. The most confusing relationship between two characters is between Natasha Romanoff and Agent Barton. When Natasha is speaking with Loki, they discuss Agent Barton a little bit but the conversation bounces from Agent Barton to Bruce Banner so much that I got completely lost. If you are all caught up on your Marvel movies, then I'm sure the film would be much more enjoyable for you, but as for me, I was not impressed in the least.",3,4,10,19 November 2012
