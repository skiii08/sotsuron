The Hangover," Dude, Where's My Car + Very Bad Things = A Slightly Less Entertaining Film Called The Hangover
","Firstly I must say this isn't a bad movie... it's simply below average. It is funny which means it fulfills it's purpose. If, however, you watch a lot of comedy don't expect to see anything new. Other than Zach Galifianakis everything here has been done and even his character would simply be the clich√©d bumbling idiot if not for Galifianakis' genius. The plot itself is very thin and poorly though out. If these guys simply utilize the logic that everyone else uses when something goes missing the movie would be over very quickly. Instead they go on this over bloated journey full of insanely obvious red herrings and numerous secondary characters that never seem to fit in with the atmosphere of the movie. But again this is comedy and because it is, it allows itself room for illogical plot holes and unnecessary silliness. I recommend if one is sitting at home and this comes of TV or if your at a friend's house and they happen to own it then go ahead and watch it but don't expect the type of movie you'll be talking about in 20 years (or even 2.) As I tell my wife time and time again just because something is funny doesn't make it good. I think in the grand scheme of the comedic genre of American film The Hangover ranks just below average.",4,8,20,8 June 2009
