Hereditary," Not good
","I'm a huge fan of horror and thrillers and my opinion counts. Believe me. People asking me what I suggest.
This is not a good movie.
Is very slow and helps to sleep, many scenes without reason (the 1 of 2 hours is unessesery), trying to make a twist at the but it fails.
An accident without police envolment, brother and sister from different human race, a mother full of Botox.
No point for decapitation. No point for wall hanging ghosts. No point for burning. Waste of time.",2,1,6,25 August 2019
