The Blair Witch Project," Scarier than the Exorcist? Don't make me laugh. Scooby Doo is scarier (and better).
","It just shows you what hype can do.  This is very poor indeed.  I don't care how much it cost to make; it still cost the same to watch.  When the ending came, I sat there thinking 'Was that it'?  I honestly think that the distributers did this for a laugh - let's see what we can get away with.A pile of bricks can win 'art' awards, so why not?",3,0,1,10 September 1999
U-571," history hollywood style
","What a stupid movie.  There were so many true stories from the War that could have been made.  Why make one up, and such a stupid one?Of course the whole story is ridiculous, but how about this:  A black man aboard a US ship as part of a special mission and is 'one of the guys'?  I'm sorry, but not in the 1940's.",2,7,14,23 November 2000
The Exorcist," Classic shocker, never bettered
","The first part of the film were a bit flat and I thought everything I'd heard about it was was an exaggeration.  But when the scary bits started I knew exactly what people were talking about.  My hair actually stood on end at one point.This really is a classic film, one you'll never forget.  I had to sleep with the lights on for some days after watching this!  The visuals are excellent, the sound is terrifying, the whole film is very well-made by a very good director.One thumb up!",10,0,0,10 September 1999
Schindler's List," What is wrong with you people?
","Exactly what one would expect.  What a surprise that he won an Oscar for this one.  What an awful, awful movie.  Spielberg's movies get worse and worse.  Still, at least this one has no 'wise kids' at the centre of the action.  Too serious a subject, I suppose.  Black and White.  Or is it?",1,58,152,10 September 1999
The Iron Giant," Superb family film
",This film was a real surprise.  So rare today to see a film with wholesome morals and not dirtied by the usual Hollywood filth.  Very good for children and adults - I recommend it heartily for people who are sick of their kids watching the usual trash.  I also enjoyed it myself!,10,0,1,29 March 2000
Jurassic Park," Special Effects and no plot - may as well play a video game...
","Poor acting, casting, writing, direction.  The 'plot' is very, very silly. Even when I was a kid I would have thought this very childish.  The dialogue was awful and Jeff Golblum was especially dreadful.I like Sam Neill and Bob Peck.  What were they doing in this?  Dicky Attenborough, we've come to expect this silliness of him.Typical Spielberg precocious 'wise kids' at the centre of the action as usual.  Cheesy themes, predictable outcomes.But the special effects were great...",2,24,73,10 September 1999
