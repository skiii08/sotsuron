The New World," Beautiful, poetic, visually arresting picture
","The New world is one of the best films I have seen in a very long time. Rarely do I see a movie that speaks to me on that level, perhaps not since I saw the Pianist, have I been so touched by a work of art. This movie is light on the dialog, in fact I *might* recommend watching it with subtitles just to make sure you don't miss anything, however I'm torn because I wouldn't want anything to interrupt the visual aspect. I'm not always able to appreciate a movie which is not purely plot driven, but this one was almost perfect in how it captured the essence of 2 people without needing explicit love scenes or constant dialog or strategised plot. The only warning is that you may have to be in the right frame of mind to be swept away. 'Mission impossible 2' it is not, (tho I loved that movie). The New World may drag a bit in the middle, and I wont give anything away but I found myself hoping things didn't have to be the way they are halfway through..but I guess that's what Disney is for.Beautiful movie. Please do yourself a favor & have this experience. It's not an elitist art-house movie that you can't get into, trust me I love everything from X-Men2 to Dirty Dancing, and it left me wishing Q'orianka Kilcher had gotten at least an Academy nomination. Colin Farrell also surprised me with how subtle & understated he could be, I fell in love with him a little. This movie should have received some of the standard Hollywood nods for a job well done. Since it didn't, I write this review to encourage any & all to see it.",Null,0,1,15 June 2006
