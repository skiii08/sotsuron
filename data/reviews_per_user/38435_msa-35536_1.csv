It," First time viewing this movie
","I have not seen the first movie created. I watched the movie with no prior knowledge of the theme or plot. The movie not well thought out. There was high interest at some parts but, between the interesting scenes were dull scenes. The graphics were poor quality and many of the scenes seems like I was watching a low rating comedy movie. This is targeted for middle school students. I would not recommend others who have not seen the original to view this movie. It was more like the Goosebumps TV show.",1,2,3,31 October 2017
