Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Brilliant
","Thanks to sharp satirists that came before, like Lenny Bruce, Andy Kauffman, Norman Lear, Redd Foxx and Eddie Murphy, Sacha Baron Cohen and his colleges create a sensation with 'Boart.' Co-scripter Anthony Hines and Director Larry Charles join forces with Cohen to satirize every sacred cow they can conjure. This includes nationalism, racism, politics, sex and religion.One outrageous joke after the next leave some audiences in stitches throughout. Indeed, it would be good to have nurses in the lobby to treat those whose sides ache (or have upset stomachs).Not that this is everyone's cup of tea; far from it. Like much avant garde and underground humor, there is much here that could be construed literally, and be downright offensive.I suspect this will play better in larger cities and more hip cosmopolitan regions than in more conservative provinces. Well, if some folks don't 'get it,' that's their problem.The rest of the younger, hip set will, and laugh themselves silly over the stinging satiric thrusts taken at so many folks' ridiculous prejudices.There's never been a film quite like 'Borat,' and it lifts the humor bar several notches higher (or lower, depending on your point of view) -- daring others to 'top this.' As for 'bad p/r,' what's scandalous today will be tame turkey tomorrow.'Borat' is a brilliant piece of work, powerful and unforgettable.",9,2,8,30 November 2006
Dead Poets Society," Who's Remembered Most?
","After these impressionable students graduate and go on to adult endeavors, do they remember the poets and poetry they studied--and are moved to read more? Or do they more fondly recall their colorful and unconventional teacher, with his unorthodox style of putting over his subject? True, poetry has taken a down slide since the fifties, and for many adults, they hardly crack a book all year, though their library displays may be full. And when they do read, the last thing seems to be poetry.So, Prof. John Keating has his work cut out: get the class' attention right off the bat, and keep holding it with innovative techniques. This he does, including standing on the table, doing imitations of Brando and Wayne reciting the Bard, and keeping the class on their feet and moving about.When Prof. John's taken to task, his young admirers come to his defense, which gets pretty emotional before it's over. Audiences seemed to go for this film, while critics were more divided. Robin Williams is energetic while yet being somewhat restrained, and Peter Weir's direction is quite serviceable.Maybe it's not enough to allow the poetry to intrinsically speak for itself anymore. Perhaps teachers are competing with the media for students' attention, requiring more and more 'creative' ways to get through. Whatever the case, Prof. Keating earned his keep through sheer effort exerted, if not through traditional academic standards.",Null,0,1,9 February 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Utter Perfection
","Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana did a commendable job of transforming E. Annie Prouix's short story into a 134-minute feature film. Added to this Rodrigo Prieto's beautiful cinematography and Ang Lee's expert direction, and 'Brokeback Mountain' emerges as genuine masterpiece.The two leads, Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger are wonderful as Jack and Enis, two 'cowboys' who have an intimate relationship beginning in 1963 and continuing for several years. In fact, the entire cast is excellent, and all contribute to a moving work of art. 'Brokeback Mountain' was an instant classic the first week it was first released in 2005, and has every indication of greatly expanding its audience as the years pass. It really should be seen by every man, woman and child over 13 in the nation.It is now part of American culture and its artistic and social impact has helped change the world. In a word, 'Brokeback' is superlative.",10,12,14,29 December 2005
Pan's Labyrinth," Minority View
","What prompted me to see this film was, quite frankly, noting the rating of 98 it received on the MetaCritic website. I've never seen a rating that high here before, and it peaked my interest.Then, just to be sure, I visited Rotten Tomatoes, and found a rating almost as high. This plus the 8+ general public rating sealed the deal. This film must be pretty good! Unfortunately, I found it to be murky, muddy and muddled; long on horror, short on fantasy, and filled with brutality, blood an torture.It didn't help that the multiplex where I saw it had the most ear-splitting volume I'd ever experienced in a theater.I'm not sorry I'm with the minority on this one. It's a picture I'd rather not learn to appreciate, and one I'd rather forget.In short, I'm happy to be an outsider here.",1,50,111,24 February 2007
Gone Baby Gone," Gone Over With Much of Public
","A morally ambiguous tale is told within a quite murky structure. It seems to wander here and there, without the feeling of anything but free form. Rather reminded me a bit of that similar detective yarn of yore, 'The Big Sleep,' in which Bogart and Bacall danced around a convoluted script--and managed to get away with it.The acting in 'Gone, Baby Gone' is so confident and dedicated, and the production so convinced of itself, that when one 'doesn't get' everything, one tends to think it's just their lack of understanding.I suppose if one would make the effort to analyze everything, much of it would make sense. Indeed, the production is designed to make one think all the ends are tied up. Still I've a suspicion that some of it's a conjurer's trick, through crafty writing and editing manipulation. Director Afflect shows us just what he wants us to see at any one time, leaving other 'bits of evidence' either out or delayed, to create a 'surprise effect' down the road.Lead actor Affect slurs and mumbles his way through his lines, I suppose giving a 'realistic' performance. Some of the violence seemed a bit gratuitous and pat; still, I admit the plot needs some action from time to time to liven things up.How long this film will 'last' remains to be seen. I've a feeling it won't be among the 'great' detective stories, but only time will tell. On the positive side, Messers. Afflect and cast and crew have made a respectable piece of work, and the much of the public and critics tend to agree. ###",Null,3,10,20 October 2007
The Battle of Algiers," Unforgettable
","There's no doubt that, once seen, 'La Battaglia di Algeri' cannot be forgotten. It's stark and horrifying images are forever imprinted on the mind.What's so utterly striking is that no documentary footage is used, only carefully staged scenes. Sometimes literally thousands of Algerian extras are employed--a remarkable feat for Director Gino Pontecorvo.Every shot here in this elaborate retelling of one of history's bloodiest battles rings true. The actors are remarkably real, and the black and white cinematography gives an authentic look and feel to every episode.I'm not sure just how accurate the politics are here (its being banned in France is notable) or exactly what statement Pontecorve is making. It seems to be pro-Algeria, and indeed the use of torture casts a shameful blemish on the French garrison.Still, one wonders what point of view the French have regarding this terrible conflict. In the end, one ponders what it's really all about. Ownership of a piece of land? This film undoubtedly prompted Marlon Brando to agree to work with this talented director in 'Burn.' The director's professional career seems as spotty and uneven as his film folio. In an interview Gino admitted to only making a film when he felt like it, even if years might pass in the interim.'La Battaglia' remains the high point of his career, and a lasting contribution to the mock-documentary style in cinematic art.",Null,1,2,4 February 2007
Amadeus," Too Many Notes
",". . . That's the way the Director's Cut struck me. Simply too much of a good thing, especially toward the end when the drama should be nearing its wrap up. We have extraneous scenes that only confuse momentum toward a dramatic finale. As for the film itself, it seems fundamentally skewed, with the author taking what appears little more that a footnote in a Mozart bio, and blowing it up to enormous proportions. The result is long on entertainment, short on history.Some films benefit from director's cuts; Amadeus does not. Fortunately, the studio cut version remains the better choice.",6,2,7,1 October 2007
The Graduate," 'Shaking the World'
","AMC preceded a showing of 'The Graduate' with its series, 'Films That Shook the World.' 'The Graduate' followed 'The Birth of a Nation' on this series. . . an indication of the social impact of these films.While many feel art doesn't have much influence on actual life, the record speaks for itself. It's documented that riots broke out in the streets when 'TBOAN' was first screened in 1915.In the case of 'TG,' it caused an uproar among 'moralists,' and was denounced from pulpits around the country. In fact, 'TG' ushered in a whole new crop of films dealing in 'sexual sensitive' and formerly 'taboo' subjects.All this can be attributed to Charles Webb, who penned the original novel. In an AMC interview, Webb admitted to having a dysfunctional family home life and an real postgrad affair that provided the basis for the fictional 'Mrs. Robinson.' Where did all this social/sexual upheaval lead? To a couple decades of grossly excessive sexual activity, only to be followed by its opposite (which we're experiencing today).The era of '60s-'70s' x-rated films, spouse swapping, groupies, undergrad affairs and the like gave way to startling 2005 STD stats, such as the incidence of herpes and related STDs.As for 'TG,' one thing that may be forgotten is how physically huge the Panavision screens were in '67. The images of 'TG' were so overwhelming (especially with Mike Nichols use of closeups and medium shots) that the viewer was thrust 'into' the action. The closest one finds now to that screen size may be in the largest of the malls--and even they may not compare.'The Graduate' hurled American cinema into a new adult dimension--and (to be honest) not all that healthy, either--for we have the societal results of that 'movement' today with STDs running rampant.One thing, though: Novelist Webb proved a genuine 'non-mainstreamer,' refusing or giving away his portion of the gross film receipts, and declining offers of fine houses and the like. You can't say anything about the man's integrity; his actions speak louder than words.",Null,1,2,22 October 2005
