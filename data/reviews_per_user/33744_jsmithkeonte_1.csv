Hereditary," If you must see it, I suppose...... I suppose you should pay for another and sneak in to this one.
","This movie for me was terrible, and I don't think it is fair to have such a high rating for a low quality movie. I thought in places it had potential, but it was all over the place. For the longest time I thought well where is the grandmother, you saw glimpses of her after her death, but she completed disappeared until the end of the movie. There was one only good scene in the movie. The audience could feel Peters' pain for the lost of his sister, I could feel the anxiety, the hurt the sorrow, the psychological trauma and I understood being a teenager and not wanting to deal with the pain. The next scene was the most powerful I felt Annie's emotion. Other than that it was drawn out and boring.There was a scene with Annie and her husband towards the end of the movie, that made cringe. The acting was poor and the scene dragged along for about 5 minutes.This movie has a satanic and demonic plot that they spring on the audience at the end of the movie, there's not a clue of any secret colts or secret societies, as if to tell the audience I trick you into watching a crappy movie. There is no indication of this anywhere in the movie or trailer.",Null,9,22,8 June 2018
