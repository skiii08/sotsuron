Scarface," Enjoyable
","Very good movie, would definitly advise a watch but it can be very violent so if you don't like violence give it a miss",9,0,0,23 February 2019
Aquaman," Good movie but not spectacular
","I enjoyed watching this movie, storyline was good and action was entertaining. However I felt it could have been more, maybe my expectation were too high going in. Definitly worth the watch, would recommend",7,7,12,4 January 2019
Suicide Squad," Should have been so much better
","This is an OK action movie, but a poor superhero/comic book movie. Had great potential but didnt live up to it, I like that first half with the introductions etc but once the story gets going it kinda slumps into a stereotypical action movie.",4,1,1,29 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Terrible
","Last Jedi was bad but this was much much worse. Storyline basically destroyed all the previous movie lore and basically means everything done episode 1 to 6 was pointless and meant nothing. Well done Disney, you actually killed it this time",1,5,9,15 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Best of the three but still poor
","Not great. Best of the bad lot but still a big let down. Practically stole the final battle from return of the Jedi, lines and all. Waste of time and money, sad to see Disney destroy the franchise",1,3,15,22 December 2019
The Killing Fields," Very good
","Watching this made me see how crazy this event was. Always heard about it but seeing the real life account brought it home, highly recommend it",8,1,1,18 August 2018
Justice League," Good, not great as it should be
",While I enjoyed this movie and have watched it I must admit that it's not as good as it could have been. It's clear where the reshoots were made and sadly looks like we'll never get the proper cut. Would recommend a watch though,6,1,3,16 November 2018
Justice League," I liked it but not perfect
","I enjoyed this movie when it came out. Bought the dvd and watched it and still enjoyed it, it is not perfect though. Synder cut would have been better as the comedy put in by Joss was poor 80% of the time. Hopefully we get a directors cut but this was still good, however I am a DC fan so I am a bit biased I suppose",6,1,4,29 August 2018
Man of Steel," Best Superman by far
","Really enjoyed it, was a dark and realistic which some people didnt like but I thought was a good chance from all the other comic book movies out there.",9,0,1,18 August 2018
American History X," Everyone should watch, still relevant today
","This movie covers a very controversial topic which oddly has become a big talk point in the modern world. The statistics they use, the arguments are all what you here in today's world. Definitly a must watch to show how people get caught up in extremism. Everyone should watch it and learn",9,0,0,2 September 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Very poor star wars movie
","I tried so hard to like this, I really wanted to like it but I just couldn't. As a big fan of star wars I was very disappointed by this movie, so many storylines that went nowhere, boring annoying characters, terrible treatment e'd legacy characters. Just give it a skip",1,11,15,29 August 2018
Wonder Woman," Well worth the watch
","Pdajjw enjoyed this movie, good action and storyline as well as likeable characters. Definitly give this movie a watch",9,3,5,31 August 2018
Black Panther," Good marvel movie
","Everyone was talking about this movie being the second coming of Jesus, that cinema would never be the same but all I saw was a typical Marvel movie, nothing more. However was enjoyable (like most marvel movies) and would recommend people to watch",6,1,2,29 August 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Great movie
","Highly recommend this movie, especially the ultimate edition. Very gripping storyline and great action scenes, definitely my favourite comic book movie to date",10,3,4,18 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Have you seen episode 4? Then you've seen this
","Saw this on release and was excited but boy was I disappointed. When everyone was pretending it was good I felt like a lone voice saying it was terrible. Glad more people joined me on that. It's such a poor remake of episode 4, Ray gets power from no where and is the best Jedi ever when she didn't even know they existed. Joke of a movie, avoid",1,6,7,15 March 2020
Annihilation," Trailer didnt do it justice
","Thought the trailer for this was poor so had to be convinced to watch it and I'm glad I did. Very good, gets your attention from the start and holds it till the end. Glad I gave it a chance",8,2,5,5 January 2019
