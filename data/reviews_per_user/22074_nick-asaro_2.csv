The Avengers," One of the best comic book movies i've ever seen.
","What can I say about the Avengers that everyone else hasn't already said? Well, believe the hype! it's great! why? well numerous reasons. One of them is the director they chose for the job of bringing one of the most iconic super teams in comics to life.Joss Whedon has showed time and time again that he knows about both the Marvel Universe (see his run on Astonishing X-men) and Team dynamics(See Firefly or any of his other works)and he works his magic to the max here. another reason is the great cast. while all good, two performances really stand out to me. The first one is Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk and the second one is Tom Hiddleston as Loki. While I enjoyed Ed Norton's Banner, I felt something was missing from him, Likability. Mark Ruffalo had Likability. Tom Hiddleston's Loki was a great villain that really had that sinister aura about him and he's better here than he was in Thor. Another Reason is the action. Not only does the final scene have An epic battle that rivals Robots trashing Chicago in Transformers 3 (This is way cooler) But other great action scenes come throughout the movie. one of my favorites is the scene at the beginning where Loki steals the Tesseract/Cosmic Cube and takes down a whole bunch of S.H.I.E.L.D agents including Nick Fury and Hawkeye. Also, The plot is fairly simplistic but what really makes this movie shone is the character dynamics. So final verdict: possibly the best movie of the summer of 2012. Assemble and go see it.",10,4,7,17 August 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Nolan's finale knocks it out of the park
","I Can easily say when i saw Dark Knight Rises, my expectations were that it would be good but it wouldn't come come close to Dark Knight. boy, was I wrong. if anything, This is even better than the Dark Knight. The plot is a good Batman story with lots of twists.It was kind of a combination of the story lines Knightfal and No man's land. i'm not going to give anything away but one of the twists involves Ra's Al ghul and his legacy. Christian Bale gives his best performance yet in the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman, who is this time around, a very different character than in previous films. The other cast members did good too. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was great as Batman's kind-of sidekick, Police detective John Blake (there is a twist involving him). I had low expectations for Anne Hathaway as Catwoman but she played a good femme fatale. Tom Hardy was great at channeling the Bane of the comics. and of course, there are the cast members from the previous films such as Michael Caine as Alfred, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox and Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon, all great. The ending even sets it up for a spin-off or a continuation of some sort. overall, better than the Dark Knight and possible contender for best Batman movie ever.",10,4,10,18 August 2012
