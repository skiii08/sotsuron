Requiem for a Dream," A Powerful Experience...
","This is my favorite movie tied with Shawshank Redemption. This movie brought so much emotion out of me that I almost cried. All the actors' performances are wonderful and Ellen Burstyn was robbed at the Academy Awards. How Julia Roberts won best female performance is beyond me. The only thing people may not like about this movie is that it is very depressing. I wouldn't recommend watching this movie if you are having troubles in your life and are in need of a laugh. A comedy would be better, but if you're looking for a wonderful movie experience I'd definitely check this one out.
Also another great point in this film is the soundtrack. Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet did an awesome job.",10,0,0,7 March 2003
The Piano," American Viewers bad? European viewers good?
","American viewers bad? European viewers good? The movie had no hidden meanings, everything was right there in the open. One has to look no further than George Baines' full frontal nudity scene. However, if I, the superior European, offered insight for the true meaning of 'The Piano' it would go something like this: Jane Campion's story was about the assassination of JFK. When Ada McGrath (Jackie Kennedy) lost her finger, that was the symbol of JFK being assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald (Alisdair Stewart). The George Baines character represented Ari Onasis. He took Jackie away from the USA to the safety of Greece. And of course Flora McGrath was none other than John boy. Jane Campion used poetic license in an ingenious way making him a female, to further add mystery to this powerful story.",3,5,12,2 January 2006
