Miracle," It's a Miracle I wasn't enthralled
","I won't always use full sentences.  A phrase, or word is as good as a mile.Expected to embrace this film with my entire being.  Forget entire.Kurt Russell gave a fine performance as Herb Brooks, coach of the U.S. Olympic soccer team that won the gold medal at the 1980 Olympics.  The 20+ soccer players were interchangeable with semi-memorable personal stories. And this is where MIRACLE failed me.  Unlike SEA BISCUIT, where 3 human lives and 1 animal life, combined to form the 'perfect storm' that was the story of Sea Biscuit, in MIRACLE the chemistry that makes good stories extraordinary was missing.  Hooray USA.  Hooray soccer team.  Hooray Herb Brooks.  But I was only touched intellectually, not viscerally.  And, since I'm no script doctor, I offer no further opinion in that area.Give me stories about people, real or fictional, that I can care about, cry with, be frightened of, or admire beyond description.MIRACLE failed, for me, by not even arousing deep feelings for Herb Brooks who had such a desperate need to win that Olympic game because he had been sent home, 20 years before, being unable to play on the U.S. team that won the gold medal in 1960.  Here was a human story barely touched upon and which, with a little milking, might have possibly saved MIRACLE, a wasted opportunity - quite sadly so.",6,0,2,7 February 2004
Match Point," Spoiler (I think) - 'Crimes & Misdemeanors II' - otherwise entitled 'Match Point'
","I am so frustrated and terribly disappointed in what I hope is a final re hash of redemption as an old-fashioned notion and the relish with which Woodman gleefully seems to enjoy 'getting away with murder,' shades of 'Crimes & Misdemeanors.' I have been a Woody Allen fan since I was a teenager (moons ago) and he's finally lost me. Not to say I won't see his next film but it looks as though Woody has finally decided, once and for all, there there is no God and God is LUCK. In 'Match Point' he alludes to how punishing the killer would renew his faith in the human condition (paraphrase) but he places the final nail in the coffin with this second tale of none redemption - luck (?) or simply poor choices all around. I found no surprises in this film except for the sorry surprise of no new 'Allen'. Even the phrase, 'I'm walking on air' was one that contributed to Michael Caine's Academy Award for 'Hannah & Her Sisters.'Just need to get over my disappointment. Or, maybe I'm expecting too much. We can all get stuck somewhere in our lives. I'm going to pray for Woody whether he likes it or not.Oh yes, the acting, directing and cinematography were just ducky!",5,0,2,25 January 2006
Closer," When a film should be rated 'X' and Isn't
","Like most films I've seen that upset or disgust me greatly, I am going to buy the Patrick Marber play, 'Closer,' to see just how close Mike Nichols & Marber got. What I'm really hoping to see in the play is more about the humanity underlying these sexual neanderthals. The word 'love' is used in the film. LOVE is non-existent in it. These 4 people play sexual ring-a-round-a rosy with each other and think the word 'commitment' is spelled the old anglo-saxon 'f' way.And maybe 'f' is what they are basically committed to. There's some line about 'truth' in the movie (in my head I kept hearing Jack Nicholson say, 'You can't handle the truth') and this is a movie in which there is little if any truth among the sexual predators. The only 'truth' comes as a semi-surprise at the end of the movie. I don't want to be a spoiler so you'll have to sit through the whole, nauseating mess to find what seemed to me to be the only 'truth' in this ugly, sometimes funny - although not meaning to be, exercise in pathetically unfulfilling lust. The acting sufficed.Oh Mike Nichols what in hell are you crying out for?",4,0,4,4 December 2004
The Alamo," Where oh where has inspiration gone?
","Had the good fortune of seeing the 1960's version of 'The Alamo' this evening, after suffering through the 2004 version of 'The Alamo' yesterday. 
How to describe the dull dialogue, one-dimensional characterizations (with the exception of Billy Bob Thornton's exceptional 'Davey Crockett'), and the claustrophobic view of the Alamo fighters who apparently were not respected by either the film's writer or director.And, there's one line that seems to sum up the politically correct view of those involved with the film - the line - something like - the Mexicans are fighting for Mexico, the Texicans want to conquer the world. 
On the other hand, in John Wayne's 'The Alamo' the fighters are treated with respect, both American and Mexican.  There was a story and dramatic line that carried you from the beginning to the end.  Situations that were unclear in 2004's murky pc film were presented clearly, thoughtfully, and with solid dramatic impact.  And the acting -- Lordy, Lordy -- Richard Widmark's feisty Jim Bowie, Laurence Harvey's powerful, yet prissy Col. Travis, and Richard Boone's powerful Sam Houston....What's the phrase - there were giants then...With a strong thumbs up for that exceptional actor - Billy Bob Thornton, who unfortunately could not singlehandedly save the current film.John Wayne respected his material, respected the people.  The writer of the 2004 version toyed with the material and provided dialogue of little consequence.  Subtlety does not appear to be his strong suit as he hands Billy Bob Thornton one-liners, shows Jim Bowie as a one-dimensional consumptive, portrays Col. Travis as an uptight incompetent and General Santa Anna as part peacock, part buffoon.Let's face it, since everyone's long dead and gone, a writer has lots of freedom in which to create his fantasy of what really happened at the Alamo and both movies have silly scenes that don't track.  But, with all of that, I'm left with that old cliche - they just don't make them like they used to.",2,2,7,12 April 2004
The Butterfly Effect," sad to see a dead butterfly!
","Please.  See 'Memento' or '21 Grams.'  Different films.  Same puzzle technique.  'Memento' is the major diagram.  Start at the end and arrive at the beginning of the story.  'Memento' - brilliant.  'Butterfly Effect,' a poor plagiarism at best, confused, & worse, the author(s), director(s) need immediate psychiatric intervention. In 'Butterfly Effect' it's almost impossible to arrive at a distinction between illusion and reality, a difference I suppose between the young performers who think they're brilliant (and are just confused) and the pros who can truly grab tough abstractions and give them a film 'reality.'Two martinis still haven't made 'The Butterfly Effect'  disappear from my memory.  Yup, it was powerful.  Worse, it couldn't and wouldn't help either you (or them) distinguish reality from illusion.  This fllm saddened me because it tried so hard to 'best' the brilliant 'Memento' and failed so miserably.",2,5,11,31 January 2004
City of God," Talk about overkill!
","Great reviews.  Disappointed by the relentless violence.  Had no idea this was based on a true story because of the excess.  As seems to be the case in 2004, graphic violence is supposed to make and help us feel the impossible situation of the poor slum kids.  It doesn't.  Damn it.  Is there anyone who remembers that the story of one, only one, victimized character is more powerful than watching millions of people slaughtered.It was like watching 2,000 St. Valentines Day massacres in 2 hours. Horrific but not touching.  We need to care.  This film had too many stories.  Tried to link Vietnam with corporate greed and the eternal reach for money and power.  This could have been a brilliant film.  Instead it was a two martini film (you had to wind down) but one which left even the photographer survivor, suspect.",7,1,3,14 February 2004
Big Fish," Wouldn't have believed it, but this one reeled me in!
","Like DUETS, which many reviewers called a 'road comedy,' not a tragic homage to music's transforming power, BIG FISH is being called a fable and a lot of other nonsensical things.'Big Fish' in a little pond called Ashton.  This was a father-son reconciliation story told in parables (golly, am I sounding biblical?). With wit, humor, charm and suspense, Tim Burton made me a believer as question after question was posed  - what is the truth about who we are?  If we dramatize and enlarge stories, is our essence forever lost in them or can we, with desire and patience, at last discern who we are and who the people we love are, understand and be understood.My bet was that I wasn't going to like this movie.  Tim Burton's work has usually had too dark an edge for me.  Even here we're dealing with death and understanding our lives and their meanings.  But Tim Burton hit every mark for me - acting,story, direction, et al.  Tears began rolling down my cheeks as the son takes over the telling of his father's last story, finally understanding that he really does know and love his father.  The son completes his father's death story/image for him in a beautiful reconciliation sequence, and life continues.Aint' that the truth!",10,0,0,10 January 2004
The Terminal," See Hungry Man staring at people scarfing down Big Macs - Hilarious!
","Directed by Stephen Spielberg. Enough to steer one to their nearest Cineplex. Advertised as an endearing comedy...No mention that this film is based on the plight of a real human being who was held at the Charles De Gaulle (sp?) Airport for some 15 years, and was paid some $100,000 by the Spielberg people to use his plight as the basis for a fictional piece of garbage. The documentary I saw on CNN mentioned that the gentleman was now free to leave the airport, the glitch having been solved, but that his mental state was so fragile he still remained at the airport. Supposedly he bought some new clothes and books with part of the $100,000 he was paid.No, it's not funny to see a hungry man watching airport travelers scarfing down burgers while he picks up the scraps. (Who the hell wrote this screenplay?) Nor is it endearing to find that the airline hostess who has a thing for married men is an OK broad because she doesn't ask her lover(s) to leave their wives! What a gal...Yes, this could have been a good movie but it needed good and honorable (and honest) people to write it.Waste of talent and money. Insulting to the real man caught in this dilemma.Oh, yes - the set is Academy Award worthy. Yes, Tom Hanks is delicious and Stanley Tucci a vicious authority figure - what else? Catherine Zeta Jones is beautiful, if confused (as the written character).What a dishonorable, disagreeable, and dishonest story. Where are the writers?",3,0,4,4 July 2004
Shall We Dance," How Can We Not Dance???
","I vaguely remember enjoying the Japanese version of this film. However I also remember its limited impact.Deep breath! My partner had tears in his eyes. People were dancing down the stairs of the stadium style theater at the River in Rancho Mirage. People waited until the very last credit & sound before leaving the theater.(A problem reviewers who think they're too important to be bothered by audiences face, when they sit in the cold comfort of a studio & couldn't' care less what the average moviegoer thinks.) This film celebrates the joy of music and dancing while it also explores the difficulties of marriage, growing older, and keeping long-term relationships alive.Some things we expect to happen don't. Something we expect to happen do.A lonely dancer stares out a dancing school window. An older man, Richard Gere, who's afraid his bones are turning cold looks up & sees her. He comes home to his wife and family. Susan Sarandon who loves him but feels she's being shut out of his life. As Richard Gere comes alive when he finally takes the dancing school plunge, so do we the audience and everyone in the film come alive. Richard is having such a great time learning his ballroom dancing that we can't help but take the ride with him. Problem with this film is the age barrier. I don't think anyone under 40, who is insensitive and filled with the arrogance of youth can really understand how wonderful this film is with its depth of understanding about the human condition and the joy of being filled with music that moves you to movement yourself, and, more importantly, revives your joy of life and living.",10,9,18,17 October 2004
