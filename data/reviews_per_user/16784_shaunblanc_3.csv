Requiem for a Dream," tough to watch and hard to forget
",Requiem is difficult to watch. It takes you into the lives of hopeless drug attics that get deeper and worse into their addiction. Very bad things happen to all of them.  Save this film for a day that really sucks so you can say 'hey my life really isn't as bad as it could be.',7,0,0,24 October 2000
The Rookie," he was as old as the movie is long
",it started out great.  Somewhere in the middle it got real boring. there were scenes that made me feel I would be able to become a pro ball player.  Even at thirty two and five foot two.  it was an inspiration with lots of time in between.,6,1,1,29 March 2002
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," The movie that brings Arnold BACK!
","Of all the sci-fi movies this year this one rates the best.  I saw the Matrix, Hulk, X- men 2, etc...None of those can compete with the energy and excitement that this movie brings to the screen.  Get off your couch and into the theatre.",10,1,1,1 July 2003
