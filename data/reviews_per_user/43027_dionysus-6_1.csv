Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Flawed but stunning
","Visually, this is one of the most incredible films I've ever seen. As a fully imagined universe it has, simply, no comparison. Despite (or perhaps because of) its hodgepodge of the world's architecture, flora, fauna, and art, it seems completely self-realized. As a complete fantasy world it holds its own with Metropolis, 2001, and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.Most of my comments are going to be about what I don't like, so let may say from the beginning: This film has magic. It is totally convinced with its own purpose and believability and is beautifully realized. It's not beautifully realized as a story, but as a world - as a universe that is alive with endless amounts of wealth and detail. If you accept it on its own terms, it is, at times, awe-inspiring.The acting, however, was decent but not great. I liked Portman, Neeson, and most of the minor characters, and didn't care for Jake Lloyd (Anakin Skywalker). One large acting problem: several of the minor characters had unfortunate stereotypical ethnic accents (the Trade Federation Viceroys and the Gungans). I don't know what this means, but it was at times borderline embarrassing. I wish they had made the accents more alien.The story sets the stage for the coming two chapters. The storyline itself is a little clunky and very reminiscent of the serials that Lucas and Spielberg love so much (like all of the Star Wars movies): a bunch of inter-connected roller-coaster rides held together by the larger plot. I enjoyed the larger plot; I just didn't enjoy the way Lucas put it together.In particular, I think Lucas writes horrible dialogue. The film is littered with unfunny non-contemporary kid-phrases like 'slime-ball' and 'doo doo.' Over and over, the characters slip from a very formal use of the English language to a faux-hip outdated slang. It's not quite 'gee whiz' but several kids do say 'yipee!' This has marred all of Lucas' films (with the possible exception of THX-1138) but in this film he really lets himself go. I wish he had a strong editor to reel in his outdated slang and his predilection for prat falls and fart jokes.The prat falls and fart jokes were mainly directed at or the fault of Jar Jar Binks. I didn't have a problem with Jar Jar. The character was annoying and received too much screen time, but the other characters reacted to him as you or I would. They constantly told him to be quiet, stay still, and shut up. Despite what you heard, the cuteness and Disney-ification isn't as bad as it was in Return of the Jedi. Still, as a kid, I never wanted to be pandered to. I enjoyed Star Wars without a silly Ewok trolloping around. I enjoyed it without gratuitous fart jokes. A big scary Wookie, a strange alien-filled bar, and creepy Vader were enough for me. But honestly, Jar Jar is no worse then C-3P0's banter in the first two movies.The movie recycles a lot of the previous movies: the destruction of the Death Star, the young boy longing for adventure, the hero's journey, and the end of Obi-Wan Kenobi (I can't tell you more). I didn't really mind that. The Star Wars films have always borrowed, like the Tarrantino films, from everyone and everything. As a kid, I didn't know and didn't care. Today, I still like the films, and love figuring out all the films or sci-fi books he refers to.Last gripe: I wish Lucas would refrain from using anymore Joseph Campbell tropes. In this one, he pushes a savior myth WAY too far. And I would have liked to have seen more of Darth Maul. He was an amazing character. Creepy and cougar-like, he stole every scene he was in. His fight scene against Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon was spectacular; it was the best sword fight I've seen in American cinema.All in all, it's not a movie that can survive all the hype that has been built up around it. It is a good film; not great, but it is a film filled with daring virtuosity and sprawling vision. Lucas may not be Welles, but he has provided a dreamscape that many will run through for years to come.",5,0,1,20 May 1999
