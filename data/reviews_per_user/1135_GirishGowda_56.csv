The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Breaking Dawn: Part 1
","As a guy, I can say that I pretty much like all the Twilight saga movies, 'Twilight' being my most favorite of the lot, like a sweet first crush, I suppose. We already know that the Twilight movies have a huge fanbase and a lot of haters too. If you know you won't like the movies, I just wonder why you would even bother watching this in the first place or if you are just dragged into it by your friend, girlfriend or somebody, you should already know what you are getting into. I also don't see why the movies or the actors attract so much hate. Robert is a good actor and Kristen, in particular is very versatile in movies other than The Twilight Saga. Bella is supposed to be awkward, nervous, clingy and moody even in the books. So, keeping that in mind, Kristen does a terrific job in portraying her character of Bella Swan. Also, come on, there is no such thing as 'real vampires' and hating on it just because of that is immature. You can dislike it all you want because lets be reasonable and face it, the acting nor the writing is groundbreaking. I have read all the books too and they aren't as good as many would have you believe, but both the books and movies are entertaining enough if you have an open mind and don't expect miracles.Moving on to the plot. Its 'The Wedding of the Century' between the vampire, Edward Cullen and his human soulmate, Bella Swan. Jacob, in a fit of rage and agony runs off into the woods hearing about their matrimony. Everything is proceeding wonderfully during the wedding, with the occasional jealousy from Jessica bubbling to the surface. Jacob arrives to the wedding to see Bella in her human form for one last time before she is whisked away by Edward and turned into a vampire. In what is a very honorable move by Edward, he lets his bride to have a dance with him. She confesses her plans on consummating her marriage in her human form which enrages Jacob. Edward travels to Isle Esme, a gift by his father, in Portugal with Bella for their honeymoon. In a twist of fate, he ends up impregnating her and the rest of the story is about Bella's determination to keep the 'abomination' growing inside, no matter the deathly consequences it will have on her. The wolf pack wages a war on the Cullens, since it has its own set of rules and cannot let her 'baby' live.This movie is more mature in its themes and tone compared to the previous ones, even though it is quite lacking in content. Oscar winner, Bill Condon has done as good a job as he could, by staying completely true to the original book source and thereby gaining the appreciation of all the Twihards. The story flowed smoothly and the effects were spectacular. Making the wolves to converse in autobot voices was an awesome touch. The opening sequence with Bella having a nightmare, where she marries Edward over the top of a pile of dead bodies, which had her friends and family was hauntingly fitting. The movie is filmed beautifully and the Carter Burwell's score and the songs are perfect in most of the scenes, though the songs may be overbearing in some sequences. And what's up with Edward talking in British accent all of a sudden and not sparkling in the sunlight! Well, it did make the movie better in my opinion. Much has been hyped about the sex scene since its inception. I was expecting it to be hilariously cheesy from the trailers, but was pleasantly surprised by the subtlety that Condon brought to them. I am, and always was, a fan of Edward-Bella, but have to say that the director could have spent a little less time on the honeymoon and wedding scenes and put in some more meat (pardon the pun) in Jacob and the wolf pack story lines. His refusal to obey Sam and breaking off from the pack wasn't done properly, because most of the viewers wouldn't understand the sheer will power and strength that took to disobey the leader. His and Rosalie's repartee which was so much entertaining in the books was just glanced upon. His inner turmoil and trying to move on from Bella by roaming the city searching for a soulmate would have added more depth.Rebecca Mader (Charlotte from Lost), the brother and ice-truck killer in Dexter and some other prominent faces made an appearance at the wedding, who will all play a big part in the next movie. The performances were mostly dependent on the main trio, who acted well, and the rest of them did the best they could have done. The standout being Charlie (Billy Burke) and Jessica (Anna Kendrick) from the rest of the cast in their minor roles. Kristen Stewart deserves a round of applause for making us emotional for Bella during the pregnancy moments and playing the awkward part perfectly, during the wedding and honeymoon scenes. Her skeletal look and the ribcage cracking were exceptionally horrifying with the help of cgi effects. Finally, her transition from the brink of death to a gorgeous vampire, with blood red eyes as the closing moment looked stunning to say the least. Bearing in mind that this is only the first part in the two parter, it laid the groundwork for the last movie quite well. I can't wait to watch Breaking Dawn: Part 2, since all the fast paced and cool bits will be in that movie.",7,8,17,28 November 2011
The Ring," One Of The Most Horrifying Movies In My Early Teens...
","I saw this movie when I was only 13 and I didn't switch on the TV for 2 weeks after I saw this movie. I cursed my parents for taking me to watch it in the theatres, I was so afraid. After I actually lived for more than 2 weeks, I was feeling better and have watched it and The Ring 2 many times since then. The Ring 2 didn't match expectations. But that is my next review, I will explain in that. The Ring and The Sixth Sense were the movies which played a huge part in making me a fan of the horror genre. Gore Verbinski directs this movie which is a Japanese movie remake. This film and The Grudge spawned all those bad Asian remakes in the coming years.Anyway, coming to the story, Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) is a journalist in Seattle city. Her sister's daughter died under mysterious circumstances and when she investigates, she finds out about an urban myth according to which a person after seeing a video dies exactly after a week. Her son had predicted his cousin's death before it had actually happened. She also watches the tape and knows that she is going to die within the week. Along with her boyfriend, she tries to find the reason behind the killer video and finds a strange and creepy story behind it. Can she save her son from Samara Morgan (Daveigh Chase), the girl in the video? Will Samara rest in peace? The beautiful and talented Naomi Watts captures Rachel's motherly instincts perfectly. Rachel is the only person to uncover anything about the video. So far, all the others simply died without knowing anything about Samara and her adopted parents. The son Aidan Keller (David Dorfman) is actually very creepy because his tone is very adult-like. He is no Haley Joel Osment (The Sixth Sense, Artificial Intelligence), but he really made me nervous. The film worked on many levels, mainly because the director does not go over the top with cheesy special effects. The backstory is really coherent and the film is completely sure of itself and that is a major plus of the film. It doesn't have long pauses in the story just to push the running time, as in many horror movies. For adults, the film may not be that scary, but it works as a thriller as well. Brian Cox as Richard Morgan is also very good. The story about the horses is something I had never seen before and it was amazing. When the plot unfolds and we know Samara's story, it is not too difficult to sympathize with her fate. A very satisfying horror movie which will be classic in the future.9/10",9,18,20,28 May 2010
Se7en," Se7en is a dark, depressing, powerful and a clever movie
","I didn't know what I was getting into when I sat down to watch this movie along with my friend. He had brought the DVD to my home and as he is a hardcore fan of Brad Pitt, he has bought almost every major hit movie of Pitt and since I am also a fan, we both watched it together. I thought it would be a cool movie like other Pitt films, but it was so dark and has so much more than other films of this genre.Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is on his last week in duty and he's all set to retire when the case of a strange death is made his responsibility to solve. Though all others think that it was a psycho who was responsible for the death, Somerset has his doubts, he thinks that the murderer is simply a clever and disgusted man who is trying to rid the society of evil. In many ways, his and the killer's view about the degrading society is alike, except that Somerset wants to leave the city for the country life and the killer is taking action. Enter Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt), the young and dynamic sleuth who has a positive view on the society, and he is made the partner to Somerset. Then onwards, there are more disgusting, shocking deaths with the seven sins as its identity. The seven sins are - Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Envy, Pride, Lust and Wrath. While Mills believes the killer is an insane person, Somerset tells him that he is a very clever, normal man and nowhere near insane with his precise killings and no clues to be found anywhere. The killer is a John Doe (played brilliantly in a cameo role by Kevin Spacey) and it takes every last bit of Somerset's and Mills willpower to not get carried away by the magnitude of the brutal, methodical killings. Tracy Mills (Gwyneth Paltrow) is the wife of Mills and they are very much in love. Will the detectives be able to stop this killer who claims himself to be a servant of God and who will bear the brunt of this maniac's insanity eventually - The society or the detectives? David Fincher is at the helm of this amazing film. This could have been a routine cop-killer story, but he does not even step into the tired and old Hollywood clichés and is not afraid to make this a dark, unique and depressing tale about the human life. Also, he does so in a very powerful and clever way. I was racking my brains to figure out who the killer was, as in films like these, they would show the killer beforehand. And in the end, it was true; the killer had come in contact with the detectives. Morgan plays the old and more worldly wise man, rather in contrast to Pitt's character who is a hot-head at times. No matter how insanely talented Pitt is, the press always seems to give more importance to his charming looks and relationship with Jolie (back then, it was Jennifer Aniston). Tracy is genuinely portrayed by Gwyneth Paltrow. She played a major part in bringing Mills and Somerset together. I loved her scene where she introduces each other. Though she didn't get enough screen-time to have satisfied me, I got over it as the ending was so emotional and I cried (I am a straight guy and I am not ashamed to say that I cried) when Pitt finds out what was in the box. I could see that one coming a couple of minutes before the movie got to it, but it doesn't mean I didn't get emotional at that point. I was hoping against hope that it wasn't what I was thinking. But, it was and I cried. Don't see this if you can't handle brutal death scenes (although they show only the aftermath of the death, it is still nauseous) and are easily bored when things are not non-stop action. But, the screenplay is one of the best I have seen in this genre. Also, the colouring layout of the movie is dark, everything is subdued and always raining, except save for the climax which is bright and hot, which served as an irony of sorts and it was wonderful. When John Doe tells Mills to become wrath, I got chills running up and down my spine.I still consider Fight Club to be the best Pitt-Fincher movie, but I can't ignore this brilliantly made movie. Though not everyone will like this film (case-in-point, my Brad Pitt fan friend), because of the dark overtone, I loved it as it isn't flashy and predictable like most movies of this genre, and actually was very brilliant.10/10",10,13,19,2 May 2010
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino's On Fire ..!!
","In Nazi-occupied France during World War II, a group of Jewish-American soldiers known as 'The Basterds' are chosen specifically to spread fear throughout the Third Reich by scalping and brutally killing Nazis.This is the ending that the holocaust truly needed & millions wished for. The opening scene between Nazi Colonel Hans Landa (Christopher Waltz), nick-named the Jew Hunter & LaPadite is one of the best scenes in cinematic history. This scene will take your breath away & your heart will be pounding all the way through. Brad Pitt does not dominate the film, as one would expect & its not really a bad thing in this case. The scalping scenes with Brad Pitt & his Basterds will leave you in splits or freak you out. I loved the way this movie was told. Tarantino is one of the best storytellers ever.Christopher Waltz, god this man made me hate him & love him at the same time & he won an Oscar for that. I am very happy that he won, he portrayed the most insane character so well. Humour is very much a key part as with all Tarantino films. The violence is sudden & lyrical. This film is a piece of art. Shoshanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent) who manages to escape from under Landa's nose & plays a key part at the end was wonderful. There are so many parts to this movie that I can't indulge here. Diane Kruger also gives a solid performance. For a Holocaust movie, Hitler is very much sidelined.This is a beautiful film, inspite of its questionable politics & its textured characters, the poetry of the dialogue & its exquisite images. But more because it is so acutely bizarre that it's the closest we might ever get to the truth. This is definitely one of the most satisfying films in all aspects.10/10",10,7,16,3 April 2010
World War Z," Smart, Fresh, Immersive and Entertaining
","Former UN employee Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt), his wife Karin (Mireille Enos) and their two daughters sit in heavy Philadelphia traffic when the city is attacked by a horde of zombies. As the chaos spreads, the Lanes escape the city and take refuge in an apartment complex. Deputy Secretary-General Thierry Umutoni (Fana Mokoena) - an old friend of Gerry's - calls and sends a helicopter to rescue them. The helicopter takes the Lanes to a U.S. Navy vessel off the coast of New York City, where a team of scientists and military personnel are analyzing the scope of the worldwide outbreak. A virologist, Dr. Andrew Fassbach (Elyes Gabel), argues that the plague is a virus, whose origin must be found in order for a vaccine to be developed. Because of his expertise as a former UN investigator, Gerry is tasked with helping Fassbach find the outbreak's source.Even though Brad Pitt is one of my most favorite actors, I wasn't expecting anything from this movie. When we were at the theaters for this one, I was dragged to another movie since my friend didn't want to see it based on the ridiculously generic trailers. In a world where there have been all kinds of zombie movies, this one didn't look particularly appealing. I finally caught it and was surprisingly entertained. First things first, World War Z actually admits that people living in this world know about zombies instead of cleaning the state clean and setting it in a world where people have no idea about the undead. Since this wasn't a comedy, that alone was very awesome.The movie travels around the globe as most doomsday movies tend to. Its also PG-13, but the terror of the relentless pursuit of the unconventionally super strong and quick zombies and the impact of the off-camera kills are as genuine as what most good rated R movies can achieve. For a PG-13 zombie movie, it has a refreshing sense of gravitas about it. Brad Pitt looked like he wasn't even trying to 'act' per se, but that came off as very good, while Mireille Enos is tragically underused. It was genuinely amazing to see that both these actors had no make up on. Matthew Fox (Lost) was in a blink and you miss role which was quite intriguing. But by far, the biggest scene stealer was the soldier, Segen (Daniella Kertesz). I just found out about the production troubles of the movie and how the entire climax had to be reshot. I honestly felt that the ending had fluidity and even elevated the stature of the movie by giving us a closer look at the predatory zombies. This doesn't follow the book in any way and has its share of flaws, but can be forgiven for being smart, fresh, immersive and immensely entertaining.7/10",7,1,4,14 September 2013
The Hunger Games," Everybody cheer the state sponsored child murders!
","Three things first: (A)-Read the review and think about it first. (B)-I'm a guy! Haven't read the books, but I now want to. (C)-Please stop shouting 'Team Peeta/Gale, bitch' everywhere! In 'The Hunger Games', a futuristic oppressive upper class society sets 24 children in a battle to fight against each other to the death every year. There are 12 districts and each district randomly selects one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 as tributes to enter the Hunger Games as a way to keep the districts in check and keep any signs of uprising at bay. The strong, sure-footed hunter, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), in a first of its kind, volunteers to be a tribute in place of her little sister in the games. The huge success of 'The Hunger Games' should be attributed to the awesome marketing and the apparent title of being the next 'Twilight' when it comes to its money making ability in the teen-fantasy genre. The camera-work is just fine, save for the jerk motions when somebody is being killed. You won't feel any nausea if you are used to Greengrass's style of cinematography. The acting from Jennifer Lawrence, Woody Harrelson, Stanley Tucci, Elizabeth Banks and Josh Hutcherson were great. Where the movie falls apart is in the second act when the contestants are inside the arena. Say what you may, at least 'Battle Royale' provided a highly definitive motive for the kids to become killers, didn't glorify the regime and didn't hold back. Of course, since this movie is PG-13, there's relatively no bloodshed on screen and I can overlook that aspect. What kept nagging me throughout the whole movie is, the kids in 'The Hunger Games' have no motive to kill each other! Sure somebody should win. But it never explains why they would pick up arms and go kill someone instead of letting nature run its course as Woody Harrelson's Haymitch Abernathy character explained earlier.The only ones with any kind of character development are Katniss and Peeta. All the others, save for the little black girl and Isabelle Fuhrman barely get to talk in the movie. We have the standard white hunk and his gang of cliché cronies who are the 'villains' and must be brought down. They smirk and take pleasure in killing others while our leads don't get their hands dirty, at all. Peeta, as far as we could see doesn't kill anybody while Katniss killed one guy in self defense trying to save the little black girl. Even the main 'villain' is killed off by cgi animals instead of our leads. So by the end of the movie, our leads are relatively guilt free and their actions in the arena doesn't affect them much. Also they never showed any of the parents being affected by watching their children kill others or being killed brutally. For a movie where 'hunger' is the main context, the children who come from ravaged, starved homes seem to adapt to the rich lifestyles quite quickly and they are barely starved even during the games. The social commentary completely fails in every aspect. Here we have a world that is like ours, which attempts to market every atrocious thing in a shiny package for the audiences. It was just touched upon and I felt like the writers were afraid of exploiting that storyline. They wanted to tell the story of a totalitarian regime, but ended up ditching it in favor of pleasing the masses. For all its talk of female empowerment, the movie panders to the audience who love Gale/Peeta including cheesy scenes which never come off as true. The Katniss we grew up liking in the movie wouldn't have kissed Peeta at that moment, unless of course it was a ploy to make the 'star-crossed lovers' notion work for the sponsors in the movie, which was never quite clear.I was in fact, highly excited to see 'The Hunger Games'. But in its attempt to appease the masses and thereby glossing over the disturbing (yet intriguing) social commentary, 'The Hunger Games' does the most heinous act any movie could do. The system which we are supposed to loathe and be disgusted by, is cheered and celebrated by the movie by virtue of making the deaths of the children in the games inconsequential by making them caricatures and inserting a convoluted love story even in the most vicarious of situations, set to pander to the teens who will go weak in the knees and forget about the immoral world this movie is actually set in. By refusing to look directly at its own story and by instead fashioning a convenient morality out of its murderous sporting event, it lets the audience off the hook and even encourages them to enjoy the blood-sport as 'entertainment'.3/10",3,139,216,26 March 2012
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," One of the best of its genre.
","Romantic comedies are dime a dozen these days and they are all mostly tacky, boring or unbelievably clichéd and raunchy but even then they are soulless rehashes of the same stuff over and over again. So when my friend recommended 'Crazy, Stupid, Love', I wasn't too interested to watch another romcom even though it starred some of my favorite actors like Emma Stone, Julianne Moore, Steve Carell, Bacon and Ryan Gosling. But, she finally persuaded me to watch this with her last week and boy do I wish I had seen this sooner.An average middle-aged couple, Cal (Steve Carell) and Emily Weaver (Julianne Moore) are out on a date when Emily announces that she wants a divorce as she is stuck in a rut and is bored by her married life. Cal cannot process the thought that the woman he loves doesn't want him anymore and is sleeping with another guy, Lindhaaaaaagen (Kevin Bacon) and leaves home. He keeps on moping at the hot local club to everybody who would listen to his plight. Here Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling), who is a real charming ladies man and seems quite successful in his life, decides to help out Cal in becoming a real man and score with the opposite sex. But Jacob cannot score with this one hottie, Hanna (Emma Stone) who is in a stupid relationship with a lawyer, according to her best friend. The rest of the movie is about how their paths collide with each other and a babysitter's crush on the dad, while the son crushes on the babysitter.This movie is really refreshingly different from the tons of other romcoms that are being churned out by Hollywood. Its surprisingly deep without throwing it at our faces, tugged at my heartstrings in a few scenes and yet made me laugh so much and relate to these flawed characters. Marissa Tomei's cameo role was awesome! Emma is as usual, brilliant in the movie. Its nice to see Gosling in a comedy after a long time. He really looked and acted like a sexy heartthrob and reminded me of Jensen Ackles for some reason. Julianne and Carell rarely disappoint me. The lovestruck babysitter, Jessica (Analeigh Tipton) deserves a special mention. It could have come off as cheesy and disgusting, but any scene involving her and Cal or her and the teen boy were so intense and ridiculously hilarious! Suffice to say that all the actors were great and I can see no flaws in the storyline or anything which made me not like the movie in any way.Oh, and also nobody could predict that amazing twist at the end! If anybody says they could see it coming without knowing that beforehand, is just plain (insert expletive) you! Or they're just saying it randomly and sticking to it. Most comedies are dragged down by the second half of the movie, but that never happens here. There's no slump!! All the credit goes to the writers and actors for pulling this off seamlessly and rooting it in reality while not compromising on the laughs. It has its heart in the right place and the story doesn't depend on cheesy, raunchy antics to push the plot forward.As I grow older and being a guy, I am finding that the romcoms I once loved are getting more nauseating day by day and there are very few of them that I really like. 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' is a little gem of a movie, quite easily the best comedy of the year. I'm not exaggerating when I say that this movie should have been nominated for the Oscars in place of 'Bridesmaids' if they wanted a distinct comedy movie to be in the Best Picture category. Watch it folks, you won't be regretting it.10/10",10,7,12,7 March 2012
Public Enemies," Its Awesome To Be Bad!!!
","This was Marion Cotillard's first film after her Oscar win a couple of years back. My heart ached when she was beaten by the police. I wanted to rip the man apart. This is the kind of feeling you want to feel when you watch a movie.The Feds try to take down notorious American gangsters John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson and Pretty Boy Floyd during a booming crime wave in the 1930's. That's the plot people.Based on the non-fiction book by Bryan Burrough & set in the time of the Great Depression, Public Enemies is a cops-and-robbers drama, only its more layered than that. John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) is the FBI's most-wanted man, responsible for robbing over a dozen banks & murdering several police officers. Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) is the FBI agent who heads the operation to catch Dillinger.Dillinger introduces himself to Marion Cotillard magnificently. He tells about his childhood & that he loves fast cars & HER! That was actually very romantic, in a weird way..! Christian Bale does what he's best at, simply staring intensely & barking orders. The fact that this was a true story made it all the more exciting. Christian Bale brings his Batman tone to some of the scenes. Some may like it, some may not. I didn't like it. I half expected Depp to get by on swagger & charm like in the Pirates Of Caribbean, but he does so much more than that. Marion Cotillard gives one of her best performances. The camera-work used in the film makes the whole setting look authentic & gives a gritty feeling to the film. You gotta love Johnny Depp's style..:) Watch this film because it is not only a gallant tale about honour & loyalty, but also because it's one hell of a thrilling ride.8/10 -Girish, 20",8,4,6,3 April 2010
Troy," Immortality Awaits - In This World Or The Next!
","'If they ever tell my story, let them say I walked with giants. Men rise & fall like the winter weeds, but these names will never die. Let them say I lived in the time of Hector, tamer of forces. Let them say I Lived, In The Time Of Achilles'King Agamemnon (Brian Cox) of Mycenae wants to rule over the world. He has already conquered most of Greece, forming them into a fragile alliance and the only kingdom powerful enough to rival the Greek nation is the kingdom of Troy, with whom they have made a peace pact. Achilles (Brad Pitt), considered the greatest warrior ever born on the face of the planet fights for the Greek army. But his disdain for Agamemnon's rule threatens to break apart the fragile alliance. In Thessaly, Greece, Agememnon challenges the King of the land to fight the war in the old fashioned way, the best fighter of each side fighting one another and deciding the result. Of course, Agamemnon calls forth Achilles, whom he hates from the bottom of his heart. Achilles finishes the fight in one move and both the armies are confounded by his superior battle skills. He has many myths surrounding him; his mother being an eternal Goddess, his immortality even in the toughest and fiercest of battles, to name a few. His only aim in life is to immortalize and etch his name into the minds of men and history books for ages to come. When his bones will be dust , he wants to be remembered as being the greatest warrior in the the time of Achilles. Paris (Orlando Bloom) is smitten by Helen (Diane Kruger) who happens to be Agamemnon's brother's young wife. They both run away from Sparta along with his brother, Hector (Eric Bana), the Prince of Troy. Having got his reason for a war with Troy, Agamemnon gets his troops and marches his massive fleet across the great seas in hopes of bringing down Troy's unbreachable walls and defeating Troy to become the greatest Emperor. The greatest of fights are always fought because of or over a woman, look at Mahabharatha and Ramayana from our Indian mythos (cannot say its completely a myth, proof is being uncovered that it all happened). Brad Pitt has probably immortalized Achilles much more than the real Achilles had ever anticipated or hoped for. Brad Pitt is like an incarnate of Achilles' ferocity, beauty, love, strength, agility, prowess, his defiance, his supreme confidence. I was left in awe of this man's performance, he is such a good actor. And everybody in the film complement him with some wonderful, fine method performances. Achilles gives a short speech when approaching the beach of Troy, saying immortality awaits beyond the horizon. He takes the beach of Troy with only 50 men, defying Agamemnon's orders! I had read the story of Troy and knew how it ended, most would also guess given the ending involves a certain 'Trojan Horse'. Well, here is how the name 'trojan' stuck to a virus. Agamemnon is really a back-stabbing, lying, cheating bastard whom I hated from the bottom of my heart. In that respect, Brian Cox was awesome as Agamemnon. Wolfgang Peterson has brought the story of Troy to life in this superb movie. Everything about this movie screams of a tale of epic proportions; love, betrayal, valour, justice, evil; and the movie is filled with testosterone filled six pack hunks to satisfy the viewer. Orlando Bloom plays the role of the scared younger brother of the heroic Hector to perfection. Other than Achilles, I loved Hector. He is like a Trojan (A man of Troy) version of our own Yudhishtira, the brave, kind and righteous king. I loved Bana's performance, I was hoping against hope he would win his fight against Achilles. The women in the movie, though having very less screen time, give amazing performances. The fight scenes are amazing even with the cgi effects, which you will rarely notice. The story is pretty authentic and the director has made a good effort to stay true to the story and make it entertaining. Give this movie a try if you haven't seen it yet and I promise you, you will be glad you saw it. 10/10",9,4,7,9 August 2010
Orphan," A chilling tale with a memorable performance by the kid
","An American couple in their 30s, who can't get over the tragedy of losing their third child, go ahead & adopt a nine-year old Russian girl, Esther to make up for the void in their lives. In all outward appearances, Esther is a silent, well behaved, responsible, kind & sweet & pretty much the kind of child you would like to have in your life.This is one of the very best 'evil child' films I have seen. Isabelle Fuhrman, who plays Esther, is brilliant with her malevolent characterization as is Aryana Engineer who plays the part of Maxiene. Kate and John Coleman (Oscar nominee Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard) have given a high calibre performance here. Daniel (Jimmy Bennet) plays their son.Let me be clear, I thought this was going to be a ghost horror film. I never saw that coming. It was a complete shock to me. I haven't been that scared or shocked in quite a while, so this film completely delivers in all aspects. The layers of the story is peeled one by one as the story unfolds by director Jaume Collet-Serra. Although everybody's performances were very good, none stands out long after you have watched this, except Isabelle Fuhrman. This girl delivers a powerhouse performance that will have you scared for quite a while. The other actors only feel like props in front of this girl's brilliance. Aryana who plays the deaf child, Maxiene is also brilliant. The anti-adoption feeling this movie gives you after you have watched it is the only drawback, & it shows it delivers where it wanted to..:) Of course, without all the drama, it wouldn't have impacted this much, so don't watch this expecting a bloodfest. This is a thriller which delivers horror.Watch it, you definitely won't regret it. This is truly a gift to the horror genre.9/10 -Girish, 20",9,7,11,3 April 2010
500 Days of Summer," Timeless..!
","(500) Days Of Summer is a beautifully woven story around two ordinary people. In the beginning only the narrator bluntly says: 'She's who he's been searching for. This is a story about boy meets girl. But you should know that this is not a love story..'Whatever this may not be, this is a story about love. The feeling of true love is captured by the timelessness of the film. It only chronicles 500 days of Tom (Joseph Levitt) with Summer (the amazing Zooey Deschanel). The first time director Marc Webb gives a story that is too real. The dialogues are not so memorable and you can't actually quote it, but it is an amazing narration with its back & forth story-telling. Though the film is in IMDb's Top 250, I don't think it deserves to get into it because there are way more films which are more better than this.The friends of Tom were caricatures, but I loved his sister Rachael (Chloe Moretz). She was a breath of fresh air in this film. And there is a Bollywood song and dance routine in the film when Tom spends the night with Summer. I am an Indian and I do like some dance and songs in Indian films. I don't go to see a Hollywood movie to see our style of dance. You may like the song and dance in the film, but I didn't like it. Summer's character could have been better etched out. Why did she leave him when she told him she was happy with him? She has a commitment phobia, but this vanishes in the ending for some trite reason. Zooey is a very likable person in all her movies and I love the way her eyes are - all big & blue like the ocean. She can also act and she and Levitt are going to have very good careers in Hollywood. And the cinematography was excellent. I heard the director was a video song director and his creativity shows in every frame. I couldn't end this without talking about the songs. What a glorious infusion of music in the story. All the songs were good and fit perfectly. If one hears the soundtrack, you can almost guess the story. I still give it an 8 on 10 because of the acting and direction and timelessness of the film - 'I am the hero of this story, don't need to be saved...'",8,14,22,26 February 2010
The Prestige," This movie is a masterpiece
","I remember seeing 'The Illusionist' a couple of years back and I was so impressed as it was my first film of the genre (give me a break, I am 20 and I wasn't seeing many films of this kind back when I was a kid). Well, this is my second film of the same genre and they were both released in the same year, with my favourite actors - Hugh Jackman & Edward Norton. They are both strokes of genius, but this is the better one of the two, as this is more complex (much much more) than The Illusionist. I am glad that I saw this last night on TV. I didn't know anything about the story and I really enjoyed it.Every magic trick consists of three acts - the first is 'The Pledge', the second is 'The Turn' and the final, hardest, most important act is 'The Prestige'. Thus begins the story of The Prestige. The climax is shown in this scene itself, that of Angier being drowned and Borden just standing there. So, Borden is convicted of Angier's murder and is sentenced to death. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) has stolen Borden's diary to unravel his 'Transported Man' trick and has went to Tesla to make his own machine, which is better than Borden's trick. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is a tormented man who doesn't want to part with his secret near his end, but doesn't have a choice if he has to see his young daughter grow up perfectly. Cutter (Michael Caine) is Angier's producer or something, but he's more like a close confidante rather than an employer.Then, the true story begins to reveal itself which is set in the 1900's. Borden and Angier have a long history. They are two rookie illusionists who work for the same man, Cutter. Borden had inadverdently caused the death of Angier's wife who was also his assistant. Then Borden has the audacity to tell Angier that he doesn't know which knot he tied on her, but it is not his fault really, he truly doesn't remember. Angier is a born showman who has everything that a magician should have, knack for misleading the audience easily. Borden is a more talented magician who doesn't have the showmanship, but he is improving constantly. Angier and Borden now entangle themselves into a life of dual in which neither can win, as we are shown at the starting itself. While Borden falls in love with Sarah, a sweet and beautiful young lady, Angier is sinking into a life of revenge against Borden. Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson) is the beautiful assistant of both Angier and Borden. She loves both of them, but she has a much more meatier part than I am telling. I won't elaborate more on the plot than this, as it will be more amazing to see it without knowing anything about it.Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play off each other perfectly and the period setting of the movie is beautiful. Except for the Batman movies, this was the first time I saw Bale in any other character and I loved his portrayal of Borden. (I skipped Terminator 4 as my friends said it was bad). Every actor performs amazingly and this was a film which I loved as the plot takes so many beautiful turns and twists, all done in a believable way (except, Tesla's machine, which won't give a shock to humans). The film also has three acts, the ending which they show at the beginning is elaborated further in the real climax. This film flows forward like a calm river which has a fall coming. It was really beautiful and poetic in many ways. The cinematography is excellent, the background score is also beautiful and the sets look very authentic. I didn't root for any one character, as both of them are flawed and no one's an upstanding man. They have their own beliefs and different methods to achieve them, but I didn't root for one, I cared for both. The ending is quite shocking and pleasing as well. If you still haven't watched this, please don't let this gem of a film pass you by. If there is a choice to see three films before I die, this will definitely be one of them.10/10",10,10,16,8 May 2010
The Adventures of Tintin," Billions of blue blistering barnacles! Tintin and Haddock make a spectacular debut!
","I still clearly remember the first time I was introduced to Tintin's world. It was the winter of 1997 and I was just an 8-year-old kid who had come home from the hospital after a freak accident. I was supposed to stay in bed for a month. The next day after coming home from work, my mom brought me 'The Black Island'. I instantly fell in love with the artwork, the soulful story, the endearing nuanced characters and exciting adventures of Tintin. I quite admired Tintin and during the course of the month I devoured all the books in the series. I kept re-reading them till I was 14 or thereabouts and every time I delved into the world of Tintin, it was like an epic adventure. Frankly it didn't matter that I knew what the story was or how it ended. That was the power of Herge's masterful storytelling. Subsequently, I also loved the 1991 TV series which was extremely faithful to the narrative of the books. So, as you can well imagine, I was very excited when I heard that one of the best and one of my most favorite directors, Spielberg was directing its big screen adaptation. Herge was a fan of Spielberg's early works and had written in a note that - 'If anyone can bring Tintin successfully to the screen, it is this young American film director, Steven Spielberg'. Almost three decades after Herge's death, his wish has finally been fulfilled. 'The Adventures of Tintin', the first big screen adaptation of the world-renowned and beloved classic comic books of the same name has been released all over the world. The animated world of Tintin is amazing to look at; every little scene has been done in great detail and care. This isn't Pixar CG animation, nor Disney's hand-drawn animation. Herge's world is created wonderfully using WETA digital by motion capture technology. The sense of wonder never ceases to exist in this world and the human emotions on the animated characters have never been richer. We can sense Spielberg's love and admiration for the original source material through the almost noir atmosphere of the film and the effort put into the characters to make them as interesting as they are in the books.PLOT: Our young, well-known reporter Tintin buys a regal model of a three-masted sailing ship, 17th century 'The Unicorn', for a good price. But he is then immediately accosted by the sinister Ivanovitch Sakharine and the mysterious figure of Barnaby, who both try to buy the model from Tintin, without success. Tintin does his research on the ship and discovers that Sir Francis Haddock was the sole survivor and captain of the ill-fated ship. Sir Francis' last words were that only a true Haddock would figure out what happened on that last voyage of The Unicorn. He returns home to find his model of the Unicorn stolen. When he breaks into Sakharine's mansion, he uncovers the truth about the existence of other Unicorn models. Along his journey to uncover the truth, he is kidnapped by smugglers. While trying to escape, he teams up with the drunkard, Captain Haddock of the Karabudjan and thus begins the epic adventure of Tintin. The movie is a combination of three books - 'The Crab with the Golden Claws', 'The Secret of the Unicorn', 'Red Rackham's Treasure'. The desert scene is taken from 'The Land of Black Gold'. While the narrative of the stories remain somewhat the same, the creative liberties taken somehow takes away the essence of what makes the character of Tintin - 'TINTIN'. I didn't admire him, like I admire the comic character. Due the fact that this movie is being released in 2011 and aimed for a completely new generation of kids and adults who may have never even touched one of Herge's masterpieces, the writers have gone for the quick paced roller-coaster ride form of storytelling. But Spielberg knows that at the center of every great movie, the hearts of the audience must empathize with the characters. He makes one of the most memorable, lovable, animated characters in history with Captain Haddock. Haddock shines over Tintin and it is to be expected since all the three books which were adapted were telling the story of Haddock's ancestors and his origins. While I did enjoy the movie, it was very jarring to see Tintin chasing after the falcon in such an unrealistic way. Herge's Tintin, while being intelligent, courageous and caring, never would have done what Spielberg's Tintin did in that particular sequence. I am not being a purist and blasting it apart. On the contrary, I got over it soon enough and even enjoyed it. Also, its quite refreshing to see that even though it is PG movie, it still showed drunkards, murders and Haddock's swearing. Interpol agents Thompson and Thomson have a small part in the movie and they are hilarious. I was glad they didn't overuse the incompetent, blundering idiots. That made them all the more likable.The movie ended with the possibility of a sequel. I hear Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings) will be bringing 'Tintin and Prisoners of the Sun' to the big-screen next. I hope to see many more Tintin movies if it has its heart in the right place like this one did. Die-hard fans of Tintin may not find the movie to be as emotionally engaging as the books, but its an excellent endeavour nonetheless. This is the one of best action-adventure movies of the year. Master filmmaker Spielberg's first foray into into the world of animation and motion capture, 'The Adventures of Tintin' is a spectacle to behold and cherish. It may even be nominated for Best Animated Picture next year. Take your kids, friends, family and have a jolly good time at the movies. 8/10",8,34,59,13 November 2011
Snatch," For Every Action, There's A Pikey Reaction!
","I saw Sherlock Holmes a couple of months ago and it was very good. I couldn't believe how much I enjoyed that and my friends were raving about Guy Ritchie's style of film-making. So, now I wanted to see Ritchie's previous works & rented out Snatch as it was 135 in the top 250 of IMDb. I have to say I was very impressed. I didn't want to know anything about this film beforehand as it takes away something from the experience and told my friends to shut up about the plot of Snatch. This was Jason Statham's second film, he was not so well known and Brad Pitt was already a superstar. This is one of the best films out there and I totally agree with IMDb users.So, this is the plot. Unscrupulous boxing promoters, violent bookmakers, a Russian gangster, incompetent amateur robbers, and supposedly Jewish jewelers fight to track down a priceless stolen diamond.Turkish (Jason Statham) and Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt) are obviously the first reason anyone would want to watch to the film. I cannot believe how awesome both Statham & Pitt were in this movie. Tommy is like Turkish's brother, they have known each other for a long time. Turkish is a boxing promoter. He entangles himself in Brick Top's hands, who is a bookmaker and Brick Top is a man you wouldn't want to end up owing him. Franky Four Fingers has a large diamond, 86 carats, which he stole and he is in league with cousin Avi. Boris The Blade wants the diamond. Everyone's a gangster or a goon, so this is a film which has nobody but thugs. Doug The Head is a dealer & if anyone knows about the diamond, he is the man. He has two twin daughters working as his assistants in his shop. Anyway, Tommy wants a caravan for himself and Turkish and goes to the pikeys to buy one. But, there he is scammed and Gorgeous George (Turkish's boxer in the unlicensed match in which Brick Top has invested a large amount of money) and Mickey fight it out in a bare knuckle match and Mickey wins, so George is out for a few months. Now, Turkish hires Mickey as the boxer for the match. The deal was that Mickey had to go down in the fourth round, but he wins in one shot, which doesn't go down too well with Brick Top. Sol and his bumbling amateur robbers get involved with the diamond, the damn dog is in all the scenes they are in which is very funny. Bullet Tooth Tony also wants the diamond. You know what? Trying to explain the plot line is ridiculous. All you need to know is, the story is set in London and most of the English spoken is in British accent.Mickey's mom is burned down along with the caravan by Brick Top because Mickey tried to get a new caravan for his mother from Turkish and had said he wouldn't fight till he got it. That was very touching, the expression on Brad Pitt's face made me so sad for his mother, I felt is anguish & anger. That was a defining moment in the film. Then the big finale match at the end of the film was just awesome. Tommy, Turkish, Mickey's life and the lives of the whole family and friends of Mickey are on the line on this match. Being the bastard Mickey is, he could not possibly go down in the fourth round at least this time, can he? Brad Pitt, Jason Statham & everybody give an engrossing performance. The film is pure brilliancy on the part of Guy Ritchie, the man has style ingrained on his bones, every scene is visually stylistic and the dialogues are superb, the background score is also really catchy. The way he has interwoven the lives of all these characters is brilliant. How else can you empathize with these characters who are all basically villains going against each other? One thing is for sure, you cannot predict one scene in the film, no matter how many movies you have watched. Go snatch a copy of 'Snatch' (I am lame, I know.) 10/10",10,15,23,14 April 2010
Pacific Rim," Baby Kaiju should have just swallowed this movie instead of swallowing that man.
","When monstrous creatures, known as Kaiju, started rising from the sea, a war began that would take millions of lives and consume humanity's resources for years on end. To combat the giant Kaiju, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes - a washed up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi) - who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past. Together, they stand as mankind's last hope against the mounting apocalypse.I knew what one could expect from a monsters v/s robots movie, but was very excited to see a popcorn flick directed by Del Toro even after reading middling reviews about it. Well, I drifted to sleep twice while watching the movie and had to go back to see what I missed. Finally realized I could miss nothing since anyone could easily predict every beat of the story since its the most clichéd movie ever. This is a movie that's dedicated to the mechanical aspects of its futuristic technology while forgetting about its narrative core. It could have been a fun ride though, but the movie didn't even try. I just couldn't take the bland and annoying 'acting', the boringly derivative plot line and the lack of even the most basic of intelligence or common sense at display in the movie. I don't even understand how Idris Elba is praised for his acting in one of his TV shows, Luther, if this is the kind of intensity he brings to the table. Simply put, he's terrible here and the rest are nipping at his heels for the Worst Actor Award.There wasn't any need to portray the world leaders as ignorant morons when the ridiculous 'wall' was their most logically sound plan to run with. But, there needed to be a contrived debacle for our heroes to overcome just like the modern blockbuster handbook dictates and decent character development be damned. There are a couple of positives though. The female lead Rinko Kikuchi, thankfully is not just a love interest and has her own little truly frightening story. Also, I thought that the massive battles were done really well, no matter the inherent logical fallacies. This is a cgi-lover's wet dream come true. What was unbelievable was that this mediocrity (at best) was directed by the master storyteller Guillermo Del Toro, the same man who brought us Pan's Labyrinth, The Devil's Backbone and Hellboy. It has a theme of humanity working together to overcome a seemingly impossible alien problem and has shots of a grand scale, but the auteur in Del Toro is hidden and everything feels small and contrived. Unless you haven't seen many monster blockbusters or don't mind wasting a couple of hours, ignore this at all costs. This is just another glorified two-hour long commercial for toys and a push to expand Hollywood's movies in the Asian territory (which worked since Pacific Rim tanked in the US, but was saved by its worldwide collections). If Michael Bay's name was stamped on the same movie instead of Del Toro's, I imagine there would have been even more deserved backlash to the final product. Baby Kaiju should have just swallowed this movie instead of swallowing that man.4/10",4,4,9,20 October 2013
21 Jump Street," A Genuinely Funny Movie
","Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are the stereotypical nerd and jock in high school who are on the opposite sides of the social spectrum. Seven years later, they both bump into each other while joining for the police force and they team up to utilize each other's positive aspects and improve themselves. They both connect and become genuine friends in due course. When a drug bust goes south, they are sent back to the local high school to blend in as students and bust a synthetic drug ring.Personally, I'm not a big fan of either of the leads, but do enjoy some of their better fare. This, as it turns out, is one of their better movies. If you can picture Tatum as a high school kid, then right off the bat it starts out funny. The chemistry between Schmidt and Jenko is infectious and instant. The actors make us connect to these characters. In that regard, Jonah and Channing were fantastic. The script deserves credits for dextrously balancing outrageous humor with great character development. The movie is subtly self-aware and relevant to today's social scenario. The explanation for why a 20-year-old police idea was being rehashed, a loopy drug trip sequence which included ice-cream heads, the explosions or the lack of them and sequences like that are insanely hilarious. The movie also deserves credit for not only not hooking up Schmidt with a superhot girl, but actually managing to believably create a bond between him and a normal (but beautiful) girl.I knew 21 Jump Street was the TV show that kick-started Johnny Depp's career, but haven't seen the show that the movie is based on. Even though the original was a serious drama and the new version veers into comedy territory, this is one of the best reboots I've seen. Johnny Depp's cameo came out of the blue and that was unbelievable. It was jaw-droppingly awesome. Overall, the movie is so much better than I thought it would be and is absolutely one of the best buddy comedies in a long time. The movie has real stakes, is fun, smart, honest, grounded and has a lot of heart along with its crude, comedic wizardry.8/10",8,2,4,10 March 2013
We're the Millers," Lewd at times, stupid throughout and overlong, but was funny more often than not
","Low level marijuana drug dealer David Clark (Jason Sudeikis) is robbed of his money and stash, some of which he owes to his supplier. His boss, wealthy drug lord Brad Gurdlinger forces David to smuggle marijuana from Mexico in order to clear his debt. Realizing that one man attempting to get through customs is too suspicious, he hires a stripper named Rose (Jennifer Aniston), a runaway teenage girl and thief named Casey (Emma Roberts), and his 18 year-old neighbor Kenny (Will Poulter) to pose as a bogus family called the 'Millers'. Because of the extra load of the marijuana on the RV, one of the radiator hoses breaks while going up a steep incline. A family they had encountered at the border called the Fitzgeralds, consisting of Don (Nick Offerman), Edie (Kathryn Hahn), and Melissa (Molly C. Quinn), catch up to them and tow the Millers' RV to a repair shop. On the trip to the shop, David learns that Don Fitzgerald is a DEA agent after finding his badge and gun in the glove compartment.By all accounts, this movie shouldn't work with its self awareness, breaking the fourth wall moments, a strip club where nobody actually do what they are supposed to, a formulaic tale told in a slightly different setting than the norm, a predictable comedy routine and lets be honest here, the entire thing was sold based on Aniston playing a stripper and still looking good at her age. But what made it work is that the Millers knows when to hold back the joke before it veers into absurdity (even more than necessary) and its actors, a plethora of NBC alumni, sell the hell out of it. That brat from the third Narnia movie is one lucky bastard who got to make out with both Aniston and Roberts. Don't go in expecting it to blow you away with its comedic ingenuity. Its lewd at times, stupid throughout and overlong, but was funny more often than not and made me laugh and that's not a bad thing.6.5/10",7,0,1,12 November 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," The Emperor's New Clothes
","Against medical advice, Pat Solitano Jr. (Bradley Cooper) is released from a mental health facility into the care of his mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver) and father Pat Sr. (Robert De Niro) after eight months of minimum court mandated treatment for bipolar disorder. Pat soon learns that his wife, Nikki (Brea Bee), has moved away and his father is out of work and resorting to illegal bookmaking to earn money to start a restaurant. Pat is determined to get his life back on track and reconcile with Nikki, who obtained a restraining order against him after a violent episode where he beat her lover to near death. At a dinner setup with his friend Ronnie (John Ortiz), he meets Ronnie's sister-in-law, Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence), a recent widow who just lost her job. Pat and Tiffany develop an odd relationship through their shared neuroses, and he sees an opportunity to communicate with Nikki through her.I so wanted to love this movie, but it turned out to be nothing more than a case of the Emperor's New Clothes syndrome. The story doesn't have one iota of surprise and painfully follows the clichéd romantic playbook to a tee. Just imagine this movie with a woman playing Bradley Cooper's character in the same style. This movie is being praised simply because its a romantic drama told from the man's point of view and he ultimately gets his young, hot girl after a bunch of pointless, heightened stakes which is supposed to develop their characters somehow. The best part is the beginning which was really strong and after that, it all spiralled down into mediocrity. Why would you want to introduce your bipolar friend who just came out of a mental institution to your wife's sister who herself was completely nuts due to the death of her husband! I like Lawrence and it wasn't her fault for the way her character oscillated between shrill shouting and constantly being on the verge of tears. The character was terribly written and the Oscar she got was completely undeserved, along with being in the wrong category to boot. Hers was clearly a supporting role. But hey, she's the new darling of Hollywood. The rest of the nominations are also flabbergasting since they are all mediocre across the board, though De Niro rose above the tepid writing. I do not even want to talk about the portrayal of people with disorder here, but you gotta hand it to Weinstein though, he makes great award campaigns. Generic, contrived and a mediocre melodrama with a faux happy ending.4/10",4,1,3,24 November 2013
Face_Off," Nicholas Cage could have given the Joker a run for his money!
","Castor Troy (Nicholas Cage) is an accomplished international assassin & Shaun Archer (John Travolta) is the head of an anti-terrorism police force. While on a mission to kill Shaun, Troy accidentally kills Shaun's little son. So, Shaun now makes it his life's mission to bring Troy to justice & gain peace of mind for himself. When Troy goes into a coma during his escape from the police, Shaun learns that he is planning to blow up a square mile of the city. So, with the help of ultramodern technology, Shaun transforms into Troy to get the information about the location of the bomb from Troy's younger brother & only three people know about this. Then Troy wakes up from his coma, transforms himself into Shaun, kills everyone who knows about the procedure & goes to live in Shaun's home. Can the real Shaun protect his family and thousands of people and show he is not Troy to everybody? Nicholas Cage is one of my favorite actors and this was coming on TV last night and I decided to see it as it had been close to a decade the last time I saw it and I didn't remember anything. Some of my friends told me that Cage could have played the Joker in Batman, if this performance was anything to go by and provided he still looked like it (he is not this good looking now). I completely agree with them on this. The level of insanity and brilliance produced by Nicholas Cage in this movie is simply mind-blowing for its time. I mean, the Joker was not the standard bar for maniac characters on screen at the time this movie was made and Cage made Troy such a chilling presence. Even as Shaun, Cage was perfect. John Travolta (this is my second Travolta movie after 'The Taking Of Pelham 123' last year) couldn't carry out Troy's maniac part very convincingly (or I should say, as convincingly as Cage), except in the climax with Shaun's daughter. But, he was perfect as Shaun. I thought that Troy was beginning to have good feelings for the daughter, while he was teaching her how to defend herself and was trying to look at life from a fresh perspective. But, that was blown out of the window and I found out that he never had any sort of feelings for anybody but himself and his brother. Joan Allen as Shaun's wife, Eve was fine in her short role. Pollux Troy also was very convincing as the nerdy and somewhat maniac brother of Castor Troy.Though the premise of the story is too far-fetched and the shoot-out between the main protagonists, whenever they meet, is insanely non-stop throughout the movie, it still entertains because of the powerhouse performance by Nicholas Cage and very credible acting from John Travolta. I hated the fact that most of the action scenes were made just to satisfy the fans, the climax was half an hour for god's sake. With this concept and these incredible actors, Face/Off's acting and dramatic scenes were so good that it would still be a great film without the shoot outs.7/10",7,9,15,2 May 2010
Dark City," Existential sci-fi!
","John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) wakes up alone in a strange hotel to find that he has lost his memory and is wanted for a series of brutal and bizarre murders involving hookers. An eccentric doctor, Daniel (Kiefer Sutherland) and his wife, Emma (Jennifer Connelly) try to make him get a grasp of things. While trying to piece together his past, he stumbles upon a fiendish underworld cult controlled by a group of beings known as The Strangers who possess the ability to put people to sleep and physically alter the city and its inhabitants lives as they please through the power of their will or telekinetic powers. John discovers that he has the power of The Strangers as well. Now he must find a way to stop them before they take control of his mind and destroy him.The title 'Dark City' is highly apt since there is no sunlight for most of the running time of the movie and the distinct, grainy, dark tone makes the movie feel almost poetic in its nature. The movie establishes the basic premise early on when we are let into the secret that nothing is as it seems and this might all be happening inside our lead, John's head. I was having 'The Matrix' feeling over and over again while the movie was unfolding. But it quickly explains itself and we understand that it doesn't happen inside the characters heads. The situations playing out are real, except the people playing them are not who they think they are. This is a mind-bender of a movie which is primarily a mystery thriller at its core. Who are the Strangers? How can John tune into their powers? What do the strangers want with this city folk? Are the Strangers, aliens or mutants? To what end are they experimenting with the people and why is the soul so important to them? This is a wonderful gem of a movie from Alexander Proyas, the director of 'I, Robot', 'The Crow' and 'Knowing'. The movie deals with the human soul and memories. Whether we are the product of our past actions, being ourselves through our memories or being who we are from another core place which has nothing to do with our past, but only our feelings. Proyas tells this complicated story through the actions of the characters. Most of the characters are intriguing and genuinely compelling. Kiefer Sutherland was outstanding in his portrayal of an eccentric scientist who has no memories of his own, but yet wants to defeat the Strangers. I have never seen this side of Jack Bauer and it somehow felt quite satisfying to see this awesome actor as such a varied character. Jennifer Connelly does well with the material that she had. William Hurt as Inspector Frank was amazing. The ending moments with his shoelaces untied, reminding him that his personality may have been switched with his subordinate was powerful. I was waiting for Rufus Sewell to turn into Jude Law for the whole movie! He resembles Law so much and Law would have been a better choice for this movie and it was very distracting. The only letdown of sorts is the climax which is over the top cheesy with the visual effects and one man bringing the system down storyline. He is one guy in a controlled experiment. They still couldn't catch him! Still, this is a very good sci-fi movie with the character interactions and mystery forming a very strong foundation. If you like Inception, The Matrix kind of movies, then this one is for you.8/10",8,1,3,25 March 2012
Now You See Me," Nothing More or Nothing Less than a Fun Ride
","Four magicians and illusionists each answer a mysterious summons to an obscure address with secrets inside. A year later, they are the Four Horseman, big time stage illusionists who climax their sold out Las Vegas show with a bank apparently robbed for real. This puts agents Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) of the FBI and Alma Vargas (Melanie Lauerent) of Interpol on the case to find out how they did it. However, this mystery proves difficult to solve even with the insights of the professional illusion exposer, Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman). What follows is a bizarre investigation where nothing is what it seems with illusions, dark secrets and hidden agendas galore as all involved are reminded of a great truth in this puzzle: the closer you look, the less you see.First, I thought it was going to be a character piece about these four master craftsmen, but it quickly turned into a heist movie. The CGI trickery, illogical setups and thinly sketched plot makes it kinda hard to appreciate it though. The revelation isn't a big surprise, but is contrived and the tricks that you don't want an explanation for are explained in detail, while the more outlandish tricks are left for the imagination since there's no possible way to explain it in the real world. It tries to come off as more clever than it actually is. There's no way the money they transferred from Arthur Tressler's (Michael Caine) account will stay in the people's accounts for long before the bank rectifies the problem. Still, it is very entertaining. The Prestige (2006) and The Illusionist (2006) are two actually great movies that you should check out if you're into magic and trickery. Doesn't matter if you love or hate this movie, you'll appreciate those two. Eisneberg is doing the same old Social Network routine here. Harrelson was frankly awesome. Ruffalo and Fisher were fine, though Fisher was greatly underutilized. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine reunite outside of the Dark Knight trilogy and they're kinda wasted really. French actress Melanie Laurent's naive Interpol character is hard to believe, but she is absolutely lovely and little things like her - 'Is this your card? Yeah? Kool' - makes the movie so much more endearing. Do not watch the movie expecting it to be an intelligent caper. It just comes off as stupid and pretentious then. This is nothing more or nothing less than a fun ride. Just for the sheer entertainment value and for the charming Melanie.7/10",7,1,2,12 September 2013

Bridesmaids," Good Times
","I wasn't interested in this movie even though it was being billed as the female version of 'The Hangover'. I liked The Hangover, but the trailers just didn't make me want to watch this movie. I'm not prejudicial when it comes to chick flicks and I do watch them with an open mind, but most comedies which are female-oriented tend to be on the boring side in my honest opinion as a guy. After it surprisingly got nominated for 2 Oscars, I had to watch 'Bridesmaids'. To be frank, I have watched only 4 movies out of all the Oscar nominated movies including all the technical categories as well. But I saw this movie due to the fact that Oscars don't nominate comedies for Best Picture, EVER! The closest was '(500) Days of Summer' which I absolutely love to pieces. So my expectations for 'Bridesmaids' was pretty high.Annie Walker (Kristen Wiig) had to let go of her passion, the bakery because of the bad economy. She sleeps around with a guy who doesn't respect her, barely makes her payments, her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) is getting married to a rich guy and the race for maid of honor is on with Helen (Rose Byrne), the new bestie who seems to be perfect for the job in every aspect, which culminates in Annie screwing up everything that comes along her way.First things first! The movie is highly overrated and didn't deserve its Best Picture nomination. 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' is THE best comedy of 2011 and if any comedy had a right to be nominated for the Oscars, it was that amazing movie. Don't misunderstand me, I liked 'Bridesmaids' and while I did enjoy it and laugh in many scenes, it plays it too safe. Secondly, I get that the movie is trying to send the message across to all of us guys that women aren't sex objects and we shouldn't objectify them. But the toilet humor was over the top and I always hate such cheap stuff. My real gripe is with the lead, Kristen Wiig. I love her in her SNL sketches, but I really didn't enjoy her character much in the movie. Annie was pathetic, unlikable and not even remotely funny most of the time! Which, in hindsight, was the way they wanted her character to go and so Wiig succeeded in that regard. Anyway, I didn't like nor care for her character one bit.This movie has lots of stuff going for it though. Melissa McCarthy deserved her nomination as she was the one who got the most laughs and was perfect in her role. Her character could have come of as atrociously cheesy, but thankfully it doesn't. I don't think any female character has ever made me laugh so hard as much as Melissa's Megan did. The ensemble cast which involves the weird siblings, a little boy, the police officer, the bridesmaids themselves and others are fluid and really enjoyable. Girls will really like this movie, my friend was laughing like a maniac. All in all, this is one of the better comedies of the year and you should watch it, but don't expect it to blow your mind.7/10",7,0,2,5 March 2012
Before Sunset," Subtle and Heartbreaking
","Nine years have passed since the events of Before Sunrise, when Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Céline (Julie Delphy) had met in Vienna. Since then, Jesse has written a novel, This Time, inspired by his time with Céline, and the book has become an American bestseller. To help sales in Europe, Jesse does a book tour. The last stop of the tour is Paris, and Jesse is doing a reading at the bookstore Shakespeare and Company. As Jesse talks with his audience, flashbacks are shown of him and Céline in Vienna; the memories of their night together have clearly remained with him despite nine years having elapsed. Three journalists are present at the bookstore, interviewing Jesse: a romantic who is convinced the book's main characters meet again, a cynic who is convinced that they do not, and a third one who, despite wanting them to meet again, remains doubtful they actually do. As he speaks with his audience his eyes wander to the side, and he can hardly believe it: Céline is smiling at him.The film is short, precise and has several impossibly long takes that are just marvelous to behold. The innocence and naivety present in the first movie is gone and they're both mature and beautiful thirty-something adults living their own lives. Yet, that one night nine years ago has been an integral part of their lives. The movie is great just to see these two people interacting again. The dialogues are more precise, the sexual tension is less, and their instinct to trust each other implicitly, like in Sunrise, is a bit held back this time around. As charming as it is, I just couldn't connect to this as much as I hoped for. Its all very subtle and heartbreaking as the movie moves forward, especially when they finally pour out their hearts and minds in the car, but - people may snigger at this - but, I needed more melodrama. I needed them to burst out crying in at least one vital scene. Its quite good, but maybe in a decade, when I'm closer to their age, then this movie might have a higher position in my eyes.7/10",7,1,1,4 November 2013
Behind The Candelabra," Sublime Performances
","Based on the autobiographical novel, the tempestuous 6-year relationship between Liberace and his much younger lover, Scott Thorson, is recounted. Scott, a young man raised in foster homes, is introduced to flamboyant entertainment giant Liberace and quickly finds himself in a romantic relationship with the legendary pianist. Swaddled in wealth and excess, Scott and Liberace have a long affair, one which Scott eventually begins to find suffocating. The life of a celebrity who only prefers other men at a time when being a homosexual was completely ridiculed at and it meant a complete destruction of one's career.I didn't know about Liberace before watching the movie. He's highly talented and is a legend, but his taste in clothes and lifestyle is awful. Flashy and expensive to be sure, but seriously revolting. There's nudity and several suggestive moments, but these scenes are done well and its a shame that many will give this one a pass because of the subject matter. I'm a heterosexual guy and it didn't bother me. Its surprising that this story is from Thorson's autobiography because it apparently portrays Liberace as a very sympathetic character although he's a very nasty individual and saw his young lovers as pets, while Thorson's own character turns from a genuinely likable, naive young man to a greedy coke head. But, even so, we can't make judgements based purely on one man's word since Liberace wasn't around to refute his claims when the book came out. Betty White's statement makes one think that maybe Thorson's account of the events are probably true for the most part.The acting is sublime with Michael Douglas finally taking a leap to genuine character roles and completely personifying Liberace. Though Scott isn't very interesting as a character, Matt Damon takes a masterful turn as the young lover. The makeup, special effects and cinematography takes years off his face and makes him look a lot younger than he is, but don't look for miracles and expect him to look like he's 20. Both Douglas and Damon should be applauded for taking on these roles. Their tender moments are unabashed and unapologetic. Dan Akyroyd is the fixer Seymour Heller, Rob Lowe as plastic surgeon Dr. Startz is just brilliant and Debbie Reynolds plays Liberace's creepy, controlling mother. For now, this is supposed to be the last directorial venture for Soderberg in feature films. Though it isn't completely captivating, it is quite competently made. The elaborate sets, the campy humor and the enigma of Liberace makes it worthwhile and the acting is a treat to behold.8/10",8,1,4,1 September 2013
Django Unchained," Pure Cinema
","In 1858, in Texas, the former German dentist Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) meets the slave Django (Jamie Foxx) in a lonely road while being transported by the slavers Speck Brothers. He asks if Django knows the Brittle Brothers and with the affirmative, he kills one of his masters and takes Django for himself, but treats him like an equal. Then Dr. Schultz tells that he is a bounty hunter chasing John, Ellis and Roger Brittle and proposes a deal to Django: if he helps him, he would give his freedom, a horse and US$ 75.00 for him. Django accepts the deal and Dr. Schultz trains him to be his deputy. They kill the brothers in Daughtray and Django tells that he would use the money to buy the freedom of his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who is a slave that speaks German. Dr. Schultz proposes another deal to Django: if he teams-up with him during the winter, he would give one-third of the rewards and help him to rescue Broomhilda. Django accepts his new deal and they become friends. After the winter, Dr. Schultz goes to Gatlinburgh and learns that Broomhilda was sold to the ruthless Calvin Candie von Shaft (Leonardo DiCaprio), who lives in the Candyland Farm, in Mississippi. Dr. Schultz plots a scheme with Django to lure Calvin and rescue Broomhilda from him. But his cruel minion Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) is not easily fooled.From anybody other than Quentin Tarantino, this would be their life's best work, but from Quentin, this was a little underwhelming, especially after having done the brilliantly subversive Inglourious Basterds with such perfection before this one. Here he excessively panders to his own vices, especially in the third act. The spatterfests were too silly and overlong. Jamie Foxx is inconsistent and doesn't convincingly pull off his character throughout the movie and this becomes more obvious towards the end when everything rests on his shoulder without Waltz and Di Caprio supporting him. For a movie that is all about him, he makes for one hell of a boring character and the actor wasn't able to bring many emotions that the character did require. The first choice for the role was apparently Will Smith who declined the role, and in my opinion, he would have made a good Django Freeman. Jackson was hilarious and Waltz was great as usual, but Di Caprio surprised me big time. He should have also been nominated for an Oscar for his flamboyant and sadistic performance. Kerry Washington is nothing but a damsel in distress which is consistent with the time and racism that prevailed back then. Tarantino also played two characters in the movie to hilarious effect. At the end of the day, this is a pure cinematic experience with great music and songs integrated with such fluidity along with sweeping visuals and reminds me of why I love movies so much.8/10",8,0,2,2 December 2013
2012," What happened to the Mayan prophecy? Only one place survives in the whole world?!!
","An epic adventure about a global cataclysm that brings an end to the world and tells of the heroic struggle of the survivors.This is what the plot is supposed to be, a heroic struggle & epic adventure. But, that was all only on the paper & not on screen. What you do get for your money is over the top special effects, with lots of good looking people having family crises & personal battles & they come together to save the world!! If you think Twilight Saga films dialogues are cheesy, this gives the word cheesy a whole new meaning on an altogether different bad level. You don't feel for any of the characters even when they are about to die. Every 5 minutes, there is a 'close call' that our heroes have to survive. How I hate myself for getting sucked into this garbage. What is more disturbing is the amount of success this film had. With the amount of money this film had riding on it, it could have given us a wonderful insight into the Mayan world & the present world when the catastrophes begin. But, it doesn't deliver. Even John Cusack, whom I like is bland. Everything about the film is boring & the special effects don't save the movie.I was aware that I should not expect much when in all the trailers they only showed things being blown up or cracked open. But, what I saw I couldn't even believe it, the characters are there only as an after thought to the effects. Ronal Emmerich's latest film had an amazing PR mechanism in place which drove herds of people in & many were tricked into believing that what they were seeing was actually good. This film was racist & idiotic. I am really glad this is Emmerich's last film. He seems to have lost his touch.Neither John Cusack's candy floss image, nor Amanda Peet's oomph manage to salvage a film that was meant to survive solely on mind-blowing special effects. What the makers seem to have forgotten is the fact that we've better video games today that allow us to create our own endings with similar special effects. Don't even think about watching this garbage even if its for free. I hate myself for paying to see this.2/10 -Girish, 20",2,11,17,3 April 2010
The Hurt Locker," War Is Painful And This One Hurts You In The Heart..!
","'The rush of battle is a potent and often lethal addiction, for war is a drug.' The Hurt Locker is about the soldiers involved in the Iraq war. Thompson is a bomb disposal expert and he gets killed during a mission to dispose a bomb. Then Sergeant First Class William Jones takes over Thompson's job and he becomes the team leader of the EOD unit. He has Sergeant JT Sanborn and Specialist Owen Eldridge in his team. Will is kind of a free spirit who doesn't give a damn about his life, this is what Sanborn thinks about him and is weary of Will. Owen is a newbie and he is very scared for his life every moment of everyday that he is out there outside his camp, he doesn't want to die. But theoretically, everything out there could be a bomb meant for them to die and they have to survive. 'War is really hell on earth' is what these young soldiers will learn on their journey.Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, this film is a very great character study of the soldiers in Iraq rather than just another mediocre war movie. This made me feel sad both for the USA soldiers, the children struck in Iraq and also some good Iraq people. They are just stuck in somebody's war and live in fear most of the time. The film has many moments and dialogues which bring a smile on the face, but beneath it all you can still feel the gloom the war brings. Will knows that he lives for the adrenaline rush that only a war can bring. Without it, in the real world back in America with his family, he feels like a nobody and he wants that rush of adrenaline. Sanborn and Owen are very angry over Will's 'devil may care' attitude because he is also putting their lives in danger. There is a scene with snipers in the hot desert and it is very heart breaking to see them suffer. Also the scene in the shower is very good. William, even though he has a lethal addiction to war, is a very sympathizable character. The little Iraqi boy, Beckham, I liked him a lot. When he becomes a human bomb, I cried for him, the pain in Will seeing him dead like that overpowered me and I just couldn't stop myself. I have seen loads of deaths of kids and people in movies, but never have I been this affected by a war film. I cared so much for the characters. The movie gives an insight into the everyday life in Iraq and its very agonizing to see what they do. All of them have just over a month to survive in Iraq, before they can come back to America and new recruits are brought over for one more year so that the whole cycle repeats itself.William Jones, Sanborn & Owen Eldridge give very good performances in the film. And how could I forget one of my favourite actress Evangeline Lilly (Lost, the TV series) who plays Connie James, wife of William James. She gives a highly believable performance as the hurting wife of Will. She just wants him to stay with the family, while he thirsts for war. This isn't like all those other war movies which just wants us to say 'look at those soldiers suffering, I want to help.' This is an intense film and is made with a lot of passion. You will have to decide for yourself, what moves you in this film.I went to see Clash Of The Titans and couldn't get tickets, so I went for this and am I glad I did. I think it deserved all those 6 Oscars that it got. I didn't know before this that no woman director had won, how sad, but I am very happy she won. But, this a film which will be always remembered as the film which resulted in the first Oscar for a woman director. Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker is a winner all the way. Go and see it if you still haven't seen it. The dialogues, camera-work, setting and everything is made to perfection.P.S: I can't believe how hot Kathryn Bigelow is:) Me & my mom thought she was only 34-38 when we first saw her in the BAFTA Awards on TV and we wondered why James and her separated. Also she is thrice my age and I have the hots for her!! Why James Cameron would divorce her, I don't know. Don't you agree? 10/10",10,41,66,19 April 2010
No Man's Land," This Trench is Not Just Another Trench
","'No Man's Land' is a black comedy set amidst an ethnic cleansing war in a catch-22 situation. Set in Bosnia and Herzegovina during 1993 at the time of the heaviest fighting between the two warring sides. Two soldiers from opposing sides in the conflict, Nino and Ciki, become trapped in no man's land, whilst a third soldier becomes a living booby trap. A UN unit go against their orders to help them.The opening night scene is powerful. The chaos, confusion and paranoia of conflict is quite realistic. The absurdity, intensity as well as the senselessness of war is shown well to an extent and there were times when the humor was very well done. I was surprised by the use of so much English in the movie, along with some French dialogues.'No Man's Land' is almost undone by the director's (who fought in the war as well) obvious partiality towards the Bosnian Muslims. The UN and the Serbs are nothing more than caricatures. Serbs are trivialized (in his opinion) as men who prefer other men (I thought that scene would have had more meaning than that and hence was disappointed) while the Muslim, Ciki is a completely heterosexual man who prefers busty, long-legged lasses. Serbs are mainly portrayed as fat, lazy, hateful and incompetent, while the opposite is true for the Muslims. The movie also chides the UN for not butting in (in addition to providing humanitarian aid) and ending the war. The UNPROFOR officer is shown as an obnoxious pervert and I'd wager there were many like him in real-life. But, all these things point to just one thing and that's propaganda. It also falters in the end when the journalists don't check out the trench and it just doesn't fit in with the character, much like Ciki shooting Nino.It won an Oscar for Best Foreign Film in 2002. While it certainly is a worthwhile movie, I cannot imagine how this won an Academy Award. It must be because of the topical issue of the twin tower blasts in the US at the time which had an enormous impact on Americans, since both Lagaan (that got lost in translation) and Amelie which were nominated that year were true masterpieces.7/10",7,1,2,15 August 2013
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," I loved this..!!
","While I don't think this deserves a 10, the harsh rating of 4.7 on IMDb leaves me no choice.I saw this movie last December itself, but writing a review now. Everybody knew that this movie would not win any Oscar awards or anything. So, before trashing this film, you should also know that. This was made for the fans & it sticks to the story in the book for most of the time. Let me make one thing clear, I loved the first movie & bought all the books immediately last year. The books are also pretty great. I loved Kristen's performance as Bella in this. My dream girl is Kristen Stewart. So, you have to know that I won't give one negative comment about her, because honestly, her performances are really good.Moving on, this is the story of the film. Bella Swan is worried that when she gets old, Edward Cullen, the vampire of her dreams will not love her anymore. In Bella's birthday party, there's an incident & Edward is noble enough to leave her from endangering her further. She always didn't understand why he liked her. She was insanely ordinary. So, though she knew there wasn't any reason for him to love her, when he leaves her she is depressed. Almost suicidal depressed. That is first love for you. Then Jacob, Charlie's friend's son becomes her 'own personal sun' & he turns out to be a werewolf. And he also loves her. Doesn't any normal guy get to love Bella? (Mike Newton is a pushover anyway). She still loves Edward & thinks that if Edward won't come back, couldn't she be with Jacob & make him happy instead of everybody being sad? She tries & then Alice Cullen comes into the scene to tell her that Edward thought she was dead & went to the Volturi to get himself killed. Bella immediately goes to Italy to save him. She doesn't want him to get himself killed over regret. (Well, she doesn't want him dead, period). All these are shown in the trailer & the final battle.Michael Sheen, the man who was nominated for Oscars last year, took this project around that time. Dakota Fanning, the actress everybody seems to love also plays a part in this. So, you have to know that this movie isn't terrible. The only terrible part was the werewolves taking their shirts off for no reason. The franchise should have stayed with Catherine Hardwicke, director of the first movie. She brought within the actors, a certain charm which was missing in some parts here. The new director Chris Weitz (The Golden Compass, American Pie), brings nothing to the table. He simply follows the book without any heart. Guaranteed box office hit will sometimes do that to some people.It seems true, pure, unadulterated love is not finding many takers among the reviewers who have judged this harshly. I would definitely hope that I would get someone who loves me even half as much as Bella loves Edward. Coming to performances, Kristen did a great job in portraying her hopeless yearning for Edward. Robert Pattinson wasn't even in 70% of the movie, but he gave a good performance. Charlie Swan (Billie Burke) is very good in his portrayal as Bella's dad. The relationship between him & Bella was better this time around. The enemy vampire, Victoria wasn't given much of a chance to act. Jacob (Taylor Lautner) gives an average performance. I was blown away by Michael Sheen's, Aro. He really shone in that part. Dakota Fanning is really wasted. I thought I was looking at a 25-30 year old woman, instead of a 16 year old girl. Also, the director should have shown the anguish in Edward after hearing about Bella's death, how he thought about a hundred ways to infuriate the Volturi clan. The scene where Alice comes back to the scene where Bella & Edward gloriously re-unite should have been dragged out, because it felt really rushed.The film doesn't deserve most of the hate coming towards it. Seriously, I think the reason why people hate the actors of Twilight & anything related to it (I'm talking about people who gave this a below 5 rating) is because the actors found overnight success & they became top stars in Hollywood. Ideally, this film would have a 8/10 rating from me, but because of the extremely low rating on IMDb, I give 10/10.-Girish, 20",10,6,14,3 April 2010
Brave," Straightforward Entertainment
","Set in Scotland in a rugged and mythical time, 'Brave' tells the tale of a young princess named Merida of the clan Dunbroch. One day she is given a longbow by her father, King Fergus, for her birthday, to her mother Queen Elinor's dismay. While practicing, Merida ventures into the woods to fetch a stray arrow, where she encounters a will-o'-the-wisp. Soon afterwards, Mor'du, a giant demon-bear, attacks the family. Merida escapes on horseback with Elinor, while Fergus fights off the bear at the cost of his left leg. Years later, Merida is now a free-spirited, headstrong girl with much younger identical triplet brothers. Elinor informs her that she is to be betrothed to one of her father's allied clans. Reminding Merida of a legend about a prince who had ruined his own kingdom by pride and refusal to follow his father's wishes, Elinor warns her that failure to consent to the marriage could harm Dunbroch, but Merida is still dissatisfied with the arrangement.Brave starts out quite enchantingly and has wonderful animation and music. We have a mother and daughter relationship that's going through a rough patch with both involved having to learn to respect each other's point of views and 'mend the bond' between themselves. In the beginning, it had the magic that most Pixar movies have, but somewhere after the first act there was a jarring transition into mediocrity when compared to other Pixar works. It lost its ambition and went into a straightforward clichéd storytelling without any scope for it to be enchanting or intelligent. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I did have high hopes. I didn't know about one director leaving due to creative differences and another one replacing her beforehand. I think the good stuff was done by the first director while the second one just added more action into it while some of the story elements were taken away to make way for plot devices. A shame really. The movie has lots of mixed messages and doesn't have a proper direction. That said, at the end of the day, its a fun and entertaining mother-daughter bonding movie.7.5/10",8,2,4,9 November 2013
Paranormal Activity," This became a hit only on hype..
","Katie Featherston & Micah Sloat move into a new home wherein they begin to hear noises enough to believe that there is something or someone else in the house. Katie believes that spirits have always followed her from the time she was a child. Her boyfriend Micah starts to believe her but also wants to record the behaviour of this paranormal entity.It was allegedly based on a true-story. Yeah, it was good in the final parts. But, the director has made 3 endings to it. So, how could it be a real story? The first part came in 2007. The 2009 theatrical ending was suggested by Steven Spielberg!! Moving on, you can see that these two actors were not professional actors. Some of the scenes were scary I accept, but I won't lose sleepless nights over this. I respect this film for having a budget of less than 20000$, but honestly how did anyone get scared like they showed in the trailer?I have watched similar programs on Discovery Channel & I believe that such things actually happen. But as a horror fan, I didn't like it, as it wasn't scary enough. I watched this at 11 in the night alone in the dark. Over-hype does that sometimes. I had sky high expectations. It didn't deliver. This was mediocre at best.5/10",5,5,9,3 April 2010
The Adjustment Bureau," The Observers.. um, Adjusters, are watching you!
","Are the choices we make really made on our own free will or is it all fate, predestined and set in stone no matter how hard we try to escape it? In 'The Adjustment Bureau', a rising politician, David Norris (Matt Damon) bumps into a ballerina, Elise (Emily Blunt) in the strangest of places under the strangest of circumstances and they are immediately attracted to each other. Even though mysterious men (The Adjusters) are dead set on keeping them apart, they keep bumping into each other by chance. Finally, one of the stranger mysterious guys kidnap him and lay it all in front of him. They are the course correctors of the world. Whenever they hand over free will to humans from the heights of human advancements, we inevitably decline into anarchy, the Dark Ages and world wars. He realizes the gravity of the situation where his and Elise's entire starlit future will no longer be a possibility if they fall in love. In the face of overwhelming odds, either he must let her go and accept his fate or risk everything to be with her and push their career into an abyss.People who haven't watched 'Fringe' are calling this movie imaginative and intriguing, while I'd say its derivative of a far greater work. The Adjustment Bureau in the movie is quite obviously fashioned along the lines of Fringe's 'OBSERVERS'. The differences being the notable not-balded heads, the use of 'portal doors' and The Adjusters being more or less angels. The Observers though, are obviously much more better written than The Adjusters who seem very non-threatening. Implying God as the Chairman was really funny to me. It made the movie less suspenseful than it should have been. Then there's a plot deviation in the middle when its revealed that David and Elise were meant to be together in all the previous plans, but the plan was changed suddenly. So, now they were meant to be with different people. This brings up the whole - Why the hell did the Chairman change the plan in the first place!! Thus, David and Elise, when you think about it, never had any free will to fall in love with each other since the remnants of the previous plans were subconsciously in their minds.Most people are comparing this movie to Inception which is highly unfair since its not an all out intelligent action/sci-fi thriller. But, if this is the kind of stories 'Inception' helps bring about in Hollywood, then its a step in the right direction. Let me be clear, I really liked the movie, but the potential it had was never quite achieved. Why did the Adjustors want humans to have a better life? What was their interest in all this? It was never explained. They didn't delve into the philosophical or sci-fi aspects of the story. The first half was far superior to the latter half of the movie. Also it didn't help with the fact that the gorgeous Emily Blunt is just the arm candy for Matt Damon and is completely under utilized, barring a few scenes. Matt Damon is perfect in his portrayal as always. By far, the breakout character being the Adjuster, Harry (Anthony Mackie) who goes against the rules and helps David Norris in his quest. In retrospect, his was the only arc where the philosophical and moral conundrum in following God's plans was even remotely touched upon (same storyline is done better in 'Supernatural'). This movie is just another 'love triumphs over all hardships' with a sci-fi/supernatural twist. Could have been done better, but its enjoyable nonetheless.7/10",7,3,4,15 March 2012
The Insider," Two of the biggest stars come together to do a true story
","I saw this movie today and this was the first movie I watched which starred either Al Pacino or Russell Crowe after I knew about them. I may have seen either of them before in other movies, but I don't recall watching either one of them previously on screen. It was coming on TV today and I knew that they starred in it and I watched it.Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) is a TV producer of '60 minutes' on CBS which is an explosive show revealing the darker side of society. Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) is a corporate Vice-President and Head of research & development in Brown & Williams Tobacco Company (or something). He is fired from his job as he was having a moral conflict with himself over the substances put into the tobaccos and the company felt threatened by him. They made him sign a legal confidentiality report and threatened his family. But, he wanted the truth to be told, that their tobacco was basically a drug. Thousands of lawsuits were brushed off every year by the company and he wanted the company to pay for their sins. Lowell Bergman contacts Jeffrey and they, with Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) as the interviewer, record Jeffrey's allegations on tape. But, due to the fact that the tobacco company could file a defamation lawsuit worth billions of dollars, CBS decides to cut out Jeffrey's interviews. In the end, Lowell gets his way and the company ends up owing $250 billion to America.The opening scene with Lowell and Mike Wallace in Iraq establishes them as true news presenters who fight for the truth and justice. They do their work with passion and are very good at what they do. The film also gives a lot of screen time on Jeffrey's family and his wife's inner turmoil on whether she could support her husband or not, in those dangerous times. Jeffrey is 'The Insider' who has lots of information about the company's illegal ways. Though the edge of the sword was always dangling above Jeffrey's neck, the villains were never shown, except in a couple of scenes and they weren't the routine big goons, as basically the tobacco company itself was the villain. Russell Crowe impressed me a lot and all of the actors did a wonderful job in portraying this real life story. But, I don't think I become a Al Pacino or Russell Crowe fan by watching this. This isn't completely a thriller, but also drama. It was perfectly directed by Michael Mann and as I didn't know how the ending went, I enjoyed it very much.8/10",8,4,7,2 May 2010
Elysium," No substance beneath all its glitter
","In 2154, the population is divided in two social classes: the wealthy people live in Elysium, a space station with all the resources; the poor people lives in the exhausted Earth. In Los Angeles, the former car thief Max da Costa (Matt Damon) is on parole and works on an unhealthy factory Armadyne managed by the CEO John Carlyle (William Fichtner). He dreams on saving money to travel to Elysium. Meanwhile the Secretary of Defense of Elysium, Delacourt(Jodie Foster), plots a coup-of-stat against President Patel (Faran Tahir), with the support of Carlyle. He programs a software that can override Elysium's data system and make any change, including the president's name to Delacourt. Carlyle uploads the software to his brain to increase its protection. Max is exposed to a lethal amount of radiation in Armadyne and has only five more days of life. He seeks out the criminal Spider (Wagner Moura) expecting to travel to Elysium, where he can use a medical chamber called Med-bay that is capable to heal any disease and save his life. Spider tells that if Max steals profitable information, such as bank accounts, from the brain of Carlyle that is on Earth. Max accepts the proposal without knowing the powerful knowledge in Carlyle's brain. When Delacourt learns that the information she needs to become president was stolen from Carlyle brain, she sends the notorious agent Kruger to hunt down Max and recover the software at any cost.Neill Blomkamp's Elysium is absolutely fantastic to look at, but it has no substance beneath all its glitter. It creates a believable future for the residents of Earth, yet Elysium doesn't look 'lived in' and the tale that's told isn't very compelling either. No matter how noble the intentions are to implement a class allegory into the sci-fi world, this was just hamfisted all around. Not once during the film did I really feel connected to the characters, story, or action. The script was way too-heavy handed in it's themes, while the characters were all woefully under-developed. The supposedly dangerous infiltration into the world's safest entity, Elysium, which has its own robot army, was breached so successfully without any defense measures when the protagonist wanted to. This is the kind of superficiality that hinders most sci-fi movies. In principle, this is the kind of movie I usually root for, but Elysium has mediocre acting, awful dialogues and one-dimensional characters along with a far-flung and completely illogical (within its own conventions) third act for me to support it. I like District 9, but don't worship it like its superfans, but this is miles apart from that movie. The only way to enjoy it is to turn your brains off and even that may not help its cause too much. Ideas don't make the movie, execution does.5/10",5,2,4,3 December 2013
Alice in Wonderland," Oh Alice, How Will You Find Your Way?
","Directed by the most crazy minded and one my favourite directors of all time in Hollywood, Tim Burton and having Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, who are as crazy and innovative as Tim is, this is a magical concoction of the classic 'Alice In Wonderland' story. Can Johnny Depp and Tim Burton do any wrong? My answer is a thumping, thundering, resounding - NO. They are the most entertaining, innovative and their movies are just incredible and other worldly. My favourite actor ever is Johnny Depp, I love his portrayal of all his characters; he is a charismatic screen presence who just wows you most of the time. I had read the book when I was a kid and except for Alice falling down the rabbit hole, I didn't remember anything. This was a fun way to fall in love with the story all over again. Tim made Alice a grown woman to help the audience connect better with the story. The dark backgrounds, the hauntingly beautiful, melodious and stirring music by Danny Elfman (Alice's theme song is really enchanting), the cinematography all add to the excellent screenplay. The cgi effects don't seem cheesy, visually this film is a juicy treat which makes one wanna take a bite at that world. The film released here in theatres this Friday (! what were they thinking releasing it so late here? Maybe a summer treat!) and I couldn't get the tickets for 3D because of the mad rush, still it was excellent in 2D. For a Disney movie, this movie was quite dark and it had the Burton stamp of authority all over it. Some users have commented that this isn't the best Depp or Burton film they have watched. They can't make movies which will triumph over their best works all the time, alright? Give them a break, they give amazing movies. Enjoy them for it is and stop complaining.Alice Kingsleigh (Mia Wasikowska) has been troubled by a strange recurring dream right through most of her life. Now, when she is nineteen, she attends a party with her mother when she is later told is actually her engagement party to wed Hamish Mascot, whose family owns her deceased father's trading firm. Unsure about everything she runs away and spots the rabbit in the coat in her dreams. She chases after it and accidentally falls down a rabbit hole. She gets trapped in a room and the only exit is too small, making Alice to drink some potions to shrink and escape. Upon entering the new magical world, she is greeted by the White Rabbit (Michael Sheen), the Dormouse, and Tweedledum and Tweedledee (Matt Lucas), who question her identity as 'the right Alice.' They take her to Absolem (Alan Rickman), a blue caterpillar, who supposedly knows about everything. He decides she is 'not hardly Alice.' She is supposed to slay the dragon, Jabberwocky on the Frabjous Day using a Vorpal sword. The Red Queen, Iracebeth (Helena Bonham Carter) has conquered Underland by stealing the crown from her sister Mirana (Anne Hathaway), the White Queen. She is informed by the Knave of Hearts that Alice has returned to Underland, causing her to send a search team to find Alice. The wandering Alice bumps into the Cheshire Cat, who takes her to a tea party where she meets the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp). Hatter is incredibly sure of himself and tells everyone she is 'absolutely Alice', settling any doubt. Now everybody but Alice have decided that she is their Champion who is going to save Underland from the evil clutches of Iracebeth and bring peace and glory back to the land.In the original Alice In Wonderland, Alice is a six-year-old girl, but in Tim Burton's bizarre vision she has become a grown nineteen-year-old woman on the threshhold of marriage. But Alice, even though more mature than before, cannot find her way through life and remains quite troubled over the prejudice against women, who are supposed to be all proper and respectful as society expects them to be. In its most basic form, this movie has a moral which tells us to be who we are and forge our own path in the world, not to be beaten down by others views of how you should conform to the society. Mia Wasikowska was good in her portrayal, quite memorable in my view. Mad Hatter is a guy whose emotions are on the surface and he cannot fake his feelings, Johnny was incredible in that role. Johnny Depp was awesome as always in these kinds of eccentric roles, but he needed to give the Hatter something more, something was nagging me all through his part. Helena stole the thunder in her hilarious and dark portrayal as the Red Queen - 'Off with his head!' That will be a classic line. Anne Hathaway is also one of my favourites, she did a decent job as the White Queen. But the whiteness in her place was mesmerizing. The other cgi character I really liked is Absolem voiced by the amazing Alan Rickman. This is the man who sent shivers down my spine as Snape when I was younger and he is absolutely enchanting as the blue caterpillar. Michael Sheen's voice was unrecognizable as the White Rabbit, but Matt Lucas's double fat boys were hilarious. The Johnny Depp dance sequence in the climax was really disturbing, it was way over the top. It is a great movie which will be considered a classic, a few years down the line. I am in love with this movie, can't wait for the DVD.9/10",9,8,12,8 June 2010
The Artist," A celebration of the silent era
","It's 1927. Arguably Hollywood's most admired movie screen idol, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), is enjoying the success of his latest picture, The Russian Affair. He enjoys his work and the adulation he receives by being a movie star, as witnessed by how he hogs the spotlight during The Russian Affair's post-premiere bows. Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo) is an aspiring young actress, who literally and figuratively runs into Valentin at the premiere, which ends up being the launching pad to her Hollywood acting career through bit parts. The advent of talking pictures brings a reversal to their fortunes as Kinograph, the movie studio where Valentin is under contract, is looking for fresh faces such as Peppy Miller to star in their talking pictures, while Valentin resists the entire notion of talking pictures. Peppy, who appreciates everything that Valentin did for her career, tries to help him as much as she can, but Valentin may have to decide on his own where and if he fits into the Hollywood machine, one where he doesn't think people want to hear him speak.A celebration of the silent era and I can surely see why it won the Oscar. This represents everything that Hollywood loves and has nostalgia for. Jean Dujardin brought his character's joy, pain, pride and the love for another woman who wasn't his wife to perfection on screen. Surprisingly, Berenice Bejo's Peppy was a heart stealer and is one of the best performances of the year by any actress. All the supporting actors like John Goodman, James Cromwell, Penelope Ann Miller (though her character was painfully one-dimensional) and others are fantastic. The music, the costumes, the sets, the execution were all great. I especially loved the metaphor when George taps his bottle onto the table and he hears sound and he can feel his career vanishing away from him. That was simply marvellous to behold and I was so in awe of that scene. The whole movie is well put together, but my only gripe is that it isn't daring. The movie doesn't do anything that hasn't already been done before and the ending is far too sweet and saccharine and very wishful for the tale its telling and that it has no worthwhile commentary to offer for what happened to many of the stars from the silent era who didn't have such a happy ending to their own tales. But, the movie is unoffensive and I do think The Artist deserved the honours bestowed upon it since its so infectious and charming.7.5/10",8,4,7,1 December 2013
Mama," Mama has the most terrifying cold opening of the year
","The senior partner of an investment brokerage Jeffrey (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) has a breakdown and kills his two associates and his wife. Then he takes his three-year old daughter Victoria and the one-year old daughter Lilly and drives his car through a winding snowing road. He has a car accident and fall off a cliff, but he brings his daughters to an abandoned and isolated cabin to kill them, but the children are saved by a creepy ghostly creature. Five years later, Jeffrey's twin brother Lucas finds the children that were raised without social relationship and claim that they have been raised by Mama. Lucas disputes the custody with the children's grandmother but Dr. Dreyfuss, who is studying the girls, selects Lucas to take care of the children. Lucas lives with his girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain), who plays in a rock'n'roll band, and Victoria and Lilly moves to their house. Soon Lucas and Annabel find that the girls were not delusional and they are not alone in the house.The cold opening scene where the father takes his kids to the cabin might be the most terrifying and heartbreaking opening of the year. It is so powerful that what follows after it seems quite mundane in comparison. Mama is quite refreshing in the sense that it fleshes out the kids characters unlike countless other horror movies which make them just caricatures and nothing else. The movie has a few genuine scary moments and is consistently creepy to th brim, but it should be viewed as a psychological drama first. If it weren't trapped in the horror genre, this could have been a great character study. There are a few jump scares and though I liked the ending, which I did not see coming, many might not feel the same way. Nikolaj (Jamie Lannister from Game of Thrones) and Jessica Chastain are good in their roles, but its the kids, Isabelle Nélisse and Megan Charpentier who are the real highlights of the movie. I also felt that Nikolaj's role was unnecessarily trimmed down instead of fleshing his character out more. The cgi kinda makes it hard to get scared when Mama is eventually revealed in all her special effects glory. Still, a good, original horror movie worth watching.7/10",7,1,2,24 September 2013

In Time," Time is Money
","Its the year 2161 and genetic alteration has allowed humans to stop aging after their 25th birthday thereby making it possible for them to live forever. But due to concerns of overpopulation, the system is tweaked so that money is replaced by 'living time' as the standard currency and people must acquire more time through labor and commercial means after turning 25 years of age, or die within a year. Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) is a 28-year-old man who lives with his 50-year old mother, Rachel (Olivia Wilde) in the ghettos and works in the factory. He encounters a 105-year-old Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer), who has more than a century on his clock and is attacked by Fortis (Alex Pettyfer), the 75-year old mobster boss of a gang called the 'Minutemen', who are infamous for stealing other people's time by force. Will helps Hamilton escape the confrontation. Hamilton tells Will that there's enough time for everyone, but it is being stockpiled for the rich to use in becoming immortal. An upset Henry describes how he is tired of being alive. He commits suicide, but not before transferring all his time to Will. Raylond Leon (Cillian Murphy) and his Timekeepers investigate the death and believe Will killed Henry for his time. So now Will is on the run from the law. After the tragic and unjust death of his mother later that night, Will promises to bring down the system and exact revenge. He forages into the upper class New Greenwich and along his travails, he meets the beautiful 27-year-old Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried) who is the daughter of the 90-year old millionaire, time-loaning businessman Phillipe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser). Will kidnaps Sylvia while escaping the Timekeepers.If not for the extremely powerful performance by Cillian Murphy, this movie would have been less than mediocre. He brings a level of complexity and intensity which is much needed to the movie. A few scenes on his back story wouldn't have hurt. Alex shines in his role as the bad guy. This is the first time that I thought Timberlake was actually an able lead actor who could carry a movie all by himself. Seyfried was amazing as well. She was perfect in her transformation from a doe-eyed, young, bored rich girl to a fighter who is rebelling against the system and more so, against her father who suffocates her life. The movie isn't too subtle about raising the issue of the huge divide between the rich and the poor or the human bodies which lay about the ghettos in broad daylight while the people never seem to be interested in them and move on like its normal, as in our society. But it never came across as heavy handed. The movie could have done away with some of the cheesier dialogues and scenes though. The opening scene where we find out that Olivia Wilde's Rachel is actually the mother of Will amazed me. Her death was heartbreaking and Olivia played her role wonderfully. It was a bit disconcerting to see everyone being so young in a movie and yet playing the parts of mothers, fathers and family. Also the use of guest stars was done really well. Johnny Galecki had a forgettable outing, but Bomer really impressed in his short screen presence. Andrew Niccol who has brought us really good movies such as Lord of War and Gattaca has let go of some of the intellect he had there. 'In Time' is a slick action movie which is quite ingenious and has a terrific concept. Its like a Robin Hood movie, where time is the money. But it is almost undone by some of its fatal flaws in screenplay and writing. The lack of security in time banks and video cameras on the streets, Will infiltrating the security of Phillipe, the apparent lack of Timekeepers who are the law enforcers and many other improbable, jarring flaws. But it does make us look at life from a different perspective and raise interesting questions. Its not as good as it should have been given the rich narrative. Despite that it is entertaining and I enjoyed the movie. The way i see it, people will be highly opinionated about it. But in the end, I think it is worth a watch and definitely not a waste of your time.7/10",7,26,45,8 November 2011
Zombieland," Rule #17: Don't Be A Hero!!
","Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is a regular boy with regular gaming addiction, but has serious people phobia & never had any friends in his life & is afraid most of the times. One day, due to the spread of an incurable virus, the whole of USA is over-run by zombies. He wants to see his parents in Columbus & during his journey meets up with Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) who loves to kill zombies. They are conned by a pair of sisters Wichita (Emma Stone) & Little Rock (Abigail Breslin). All of them become friends over their crazy journey across America.I seriously loved this film. The comedy is great, we care about the characters, the zombies are gross & the dialogues are seriously cool. This became one of my favourite comedy films of all time, as the character development is strong & there are laughs all the way through. This film has something which lots of films in this genre are missing, it has heart. The characters are warm & the little drama it has is very sincere.The standout performance comes from Woody Harrelson who is Twinkie loving and zombie hating. Jesse Eisenberg is really maturing as an actor. His latest films have all been good. And his rules, God The Rules, that was so much fun. Abigail Breslin plays yet again the girl-who's-mature-way-beyond-her-age. It may sound boring, but trust me it is anything but that. Emma Stone as Wichita, I loved her. All the characters were endearing to me.This will undoubtedly become a cult classic, much in the same way as 'Shaun Of The Dead'. A zombie comedy that's this good has taken too long to come after Shaun of the Dead. But it is definitely worth the wait:) 9/10 -Girish,20",9,40,54,4 April 2010
Psycho," A boy's best friend is his mother!
","Marion Crane steals $40,000 from her employer's client, and subsequently encounters a young motel proprietor, Norman Bates who has spent too long under the domination of his mother.Janet Leigh as Marion Crane was riveting to watch. She performs realistically and she is beautiful and radiant. The story of a young woman in love, who gets her hand on some money and wants to be better off in life with her lover. The scenes with her and the cop were absolutely thrilling. I was expecting the cop to search her bag and bring her to justice. The shower scene in the hotel room is a classic. How many films we know have tried to copy it!! And the scene which was shot from her eye was haunting.Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates was absolutely wonderful and terrifying in the end. He made me care for his character who was under his mother's subjugation and did what any son who loves his mother would do (atleast, to him it was true. I would have been scared out of my mind).Also, the little things in the movie do count. Milton Arbogast as the private detective, I wanted him to leave Bates alone as Norman was such an understandable character. Hitchcock delivers horror in a movie which has no gore. I never thought this old movie could be this awesome. I mean, the score was chilling and its still used today with all kinds of variations. This is the one of the films which spawned every horror filmmaker out there to follow the footsteps of Hitchcock and be as great as him (unfortunately, there are only a few).Words don't do justice to this movie. Hitchcock does not disappoint by leaving out his trademark dark humor. He is brilliant by making the climax so scary. I really didn't see the ending coming. It was sheer brilliance on the part of Hitchcock. We still got films that have the same theme recycled over and over again. But, nothing is as good as the original. As they say, 'old is gold' (I never thought I would say that). Hitchcock's decision to make this in black and white is impressive as it is more scary without the colours.Do yourselves a favour and make your kids watch this film before they can get brainwashed into thinking today's horror films are scary. The smile at the end by Norman Bates (I'm so awestruck and scared by it) - so creepy. I loved it..!! 10/10",10,4,7,3 April 2010
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Excellent performances complement a brilliant direction
","The opening shot of the film is a bleak glance at an Oregon morning. The background score is haunting, stirring and graceful. A car is approaching towards what would be a mental hospital. It contains a dangerous man, R.P. McMurphy who has been sent to the mental hospital by the police. He had raped a 15 year old girl (I still can't believe how anybody could do that to a child. Come on people, be kind and civilized. Women aren't just objects to satisfy your needs. Don't be cruel animals.) and gotten into lots of fights at the prison, which thereby was concluded by the prison officials to send him into a mental hospital for clarification on whether he was really crazy or just pretending. He meets the head nurse Ratched (funny name) in the weekly routine therapeutic sessions with the other crazy people. She is controlling and everything proceeds as she wishes. He befriends the other people in the ward and they look up to him as their hero when he does everything he can to irritate Nurse Ratched. In due course of time, he even manages to be friends with the Chief Bromden (no, no. He's also a patient), who is a huge native American and apparently can't talk or hear. But, he confesses to McMurphy later in the movie that he is just pretending. The performance of Jack Nicholson as McMurphy is really haunting. This film has won 5 major Oscars - Best Film, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay (adapted), only 2 others have managed that feat. Danny Devito's debut performance is heartwarming and the stammering boy, Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif) gave such an outstanding performance that the climax will be remembered by everyone who has ever seen this movie. The professor in Back To The Future movies also does a good job here. Everybody in the film give awesome performances. But, I am still wondering, did Louise Fletcher really deserve that Oscar? I mean she played her role really well, but that is what all nurses do. They don't give free rein to the patients and take the hard decisions. The one scene I liked was when Billy commits suicide and both Ratched and McMurphy seem to be thinking that it is their fault for his death and McMurphy tries to strangle Ratched, which eventually leads to a procedure called Lobotomy to be done on McMurphy and he is brain-dead after that. In the beginning, I knew McMurphy was just pretending to be crazy. But, during his time in the hospital we can see the subtle changes in him. How could he allow his lover to sleep with someone else? (maybe she was a hooker, I don't know) And nobody seems to be commenting on Candy (Marya Small) who gave such a sweet portrayal of a woman who likes a bad person, but even then continues to give into his every demands. I liked her very much. The Chief didn't want McMurphy, who wanted to get out more than anything else, to live on like that. So, he strangled him to death and in truly symbolic reference lifted the water basin or something and threw it through the windows and escaped into the bleak Oregon morning. I thought McMurphy was the one who would fly out of the cuckoo's nest, but it wasn't the case. If McMurphy had lived and escaped, this wouldn't be a great classic and it wouldn't have been remembered still today. Director Milos Forman, pat yourself on the back for this amazing gem. Three brilliant moments in the film are 1. the fishing trip 2. the party in the mental hospital. 3. The jaw-dropping ending. This and the very real performances by the actors as mental patients made the film excellent for me. I am only glad that today's mental institutions don't resemble the prison-like hospitals back then. This also represents the society's attitude towards mentally challenged people. There is a scene where McMurphy tells the patients that they are no more crazy than the average goon out there in the streets, that was a brilliant scene. And the shock that flits over McMurphy's face when he finds out that most of them have come into the mental hospital voluntarily and he is one of the very few committed persons in there is awesome. The dialogue after this revelation in which he says to Billy that he should go out there and be in a convertible, bird-dogging chicks and banging beaver is supremely spectacular. I haven't read the book, nor do I want to because I want to keep this amazing version in my head. Jack Nicholson is at his best here and everybody should see this movie at least once before they die. 10/10 - Girish, 20",10,4,8,23 April 2010
Inception," Is The Dream The Reality or Is The Reality A Dream?!!
","'Dreams feel real while we are in them. Its only when we wake up that we realize something was strange...' I think I am in love with this movie. This is a very captivating movie which is slickly edited and directed. I don't want to hype this movie too much, but this movie is truly the best film in this year by far, and one of the best of this decade. Christopher Nolan is one of my favourite directors and Leonardo Di Caprio is also one of my favourite actors. I cannot believe that this incredible actor gets snubbed at the Oscars year after year even after doing so many amazing movies. Anyway, the idea for the creation of this movie is not exactly new. I have seen some movies which take place inside the subconscious mind, but Inception pushes the boundary to a whole new level. There are three levels; a dream, within a dream, within a dream which is a whole new concept and it was exciting. For every 5 minutes in the real world, it is an hour in the first level dream state, a week in the second level and some decades in the third level. The film scores some brownie points for the concept itself. My friends and me were captivated by the world of dreams. The great background score along with the taut screenplay was spectacular.Cobb (Leonardo Di Caprio) is the best at what he does and the US government is wary of his skills for which it has made him an international fugitive. Cobb isn't your normal skilled thief, he is the best in the dangerous art of extraction, that is he delves deep into your subconscious mind while you are asleep and steals valuable secrets. This rare superior ability of Cobb has made him a coveted player in the immoral world of corporate espionage. During one of his normal extraction jobs, he cannot uncover the secret that a corporate leader, Saito (Ken Watanabe) is hiding. Saito offers him his life back in USA with his children if he does one last job for him; Inception. Planting an idea in the human mind is a far more dangerous job than extraction, but Cobb accepts and assembles a group of talented players to pull off this mission. Ariadne (Ellen Page) is the new comer and her job is to design the world in the dream, as the previous guy isn't exactly available and Cobb himself has took himself out from designing. Mal Cobb (Marion Cotillard) keeps ruining Cobb's perfect dream plans and there seems to be a dark secret which nobody know. Cobb could potentially destroy their lives if he cannot control his memories and dreams.When Christoher Nolan announced that he would put Batman on the backburner and make this movie with Di Caprio, I was really disappointed because although I am a fan of Di Caprio, I loved the new Batman franchise under the direction of Nolan. It was darker, more intense and definitely more exciting, and I wanted the third part to be made soon. If you have seen the trailers for Inception, you know that it doesn't explain much about the plot. But it looked stunning and I went along for Nolan's ride, being a willing participant. I was blown away and most of you will be too if you would be willing to accept the plot. To write a dream is difficult in this era when most of the stories out there are just rehashed versions of the same story. Somebody should try to follow in Nolan's great footsteps, because we need more filmmakers like him who aren't afraid to blast away the boundaries and create their own benchmark. This movie will be remembered and hailed for generations to come.Some movies make you think deeper even after you finish watching it and this is definitely one of them. Tom keeps on dreaming that one day he will be able to return to his home and live with his children in reality. But the boundary between dream and reality is blurring. Marion Cotillard's scenes were gripping and my heartbeat was racing when she was on the window sill. The English guy gave the lighthearted moments in the movie which I liked. The movie takes us through a roller coaster ride, oscillating between dream and reality and sometimes I was left wondering whether the events were taking place in someone's dream or in reality. Christopher Nolan has displayed some excellent film-making techniques and come up with a story that is intelligent as well as exciting. The performances are great across the board and I am truly hoping that Leo Di Caprio gets an Oscar nod this time around (Two back to back amazing movies from him - Shutter Island and Inception, Oscar is way overdue for him). The supporting cast of Ellen Page, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Marion Cotillard, Dileep Rao, Michael Caine were great. Di Caprio headed the group on his able shoulders and doesn't disappoint. Three cheers to the master director, Christopher Nolan.10/10",10,7,14,23 July 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Modern Take on a Classic Holmes Fires on All Cylinders
","First of all, let me start by saying that after watching this movie, Robert Downey Jr (Iron Man) is my new favorite action hero. Guy Ritchie directed this movie and I haven't watched his previous works, but I'm very interested in them now. The film opened here to packed theaters and awesome reviews. I was a bit skeptical because what would be so great about 'Sherlock Holmes - The Action Movie?' In the novel he is a brilliant but quiet detective who uses his stealth and brains and what type of action would that make in a movie? But anyway, I was very happy to hear that Sherlock Holmes would come to the big screen. I make it a point not to see the trailers of any movie. So, I was a novice having only seen the ratings which it got in local papers.Then the film opened and me and my friends were awestruck by the DOWNEY HURRICANE. I was literally grinning from ear to ear. I was even smiling with anticipation when Sherlock Holmes ends in a situation when his life is in danger. In the books, he's not much of a fighter. His fighting interests are just alluded to. But here, he was just wow!! Downey has an uncanny ability to make people sit up and care for his character (I have seen only Iron Man and Zodiac). The scene in which he fights in a wrestling ring in a dingy building was awesome, the background score really amazed me. I loved the score and the song during the fight and the end credits. The starting of the movie was accurate in its portrayal of Holmes as a miserable, irresponsible drug addict who did indeed sleep on the floor, insult his best friend, experiment on his dog, and never ever wore a deerstalker's cap (in the TV series this cap is made ridiculously famous). I loved Rachael McAdams in THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE (this made me cry), THE NOTEBOOK and in the supporting roles in MEAN GIRLS and THE HOT CHICK. In this, she epitomizes the Beauty with Brains saying in the role of Irene Adler. I loved her. And Watson played by Jude Law (I have only seen his The Talented Mr. Ripley and The Aviator mainly because of the lead actors there) was surprisingly very good when you take into account that he's not at all what other versions have portrayed him as (fat and bumbling) and is faithful to the books. Lord Blackwood, with his weird magical capabilities really gave me the chills. I didn't even feel like this movie was two hours long. The very authentic 1900's look of the movie added to the genuine entertainment of this action and surprisingly comedic movie. This is The Best Holmes-Watson duo in a very long time. Guy Ritchie is an amazing director and I have to see more of his works.Oh, and I have to say this; after AVATAR came here, Hollywood movies are attracting audiences like never before. So, I hope your screenwriters don't think of us subcontinent audiences as being dumb and give us trashy over-hyped movies like the annoying 2012, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY and DRAGONBALL: EVOLUTION which were way too crappy.9/10",9,5,8,26 February 2010
The Terminal," Really Funny and Moving
","I didn't know that this movie was directed by Steven Spielberg until the final credits came on screen. Though this movie has come so many times on TV, I only watched it today. I wasn't interested in it all that much before. This is a really funny and moving film.Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) from Krakozhia enters into the US JFK terminal. Before leaving for New York, there comes a news that there is war going on internally in his country. So, now he is a citizen of nowhere and has to stay at the airport till there is peace in his own country. In the terminal, he struggles for food, place to sleep and meets good people and falls for Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who is an air hostess. But Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) does everything he can to get Viktor out of his airport and hand him over to the authorities. He makes close friends in Gupta Rajan, a sweeper, and Enrique Cruz and another man. Why does he want to go to the Big Apple so badly? And will his romance with Amelia have an happy ending? And will he take the bait of Frank Dixon? The shot in the beginning where the camera zooms from Viktor's face to show us the entire lounging area is so heart-breaking. Even though he's surrounded by people, he is all alone. Directed by the visual effects master Steven Spielberg, this is quite different from the other films he has directed (atleast the ones I have seen). He addresses the discrimination that some outsiders face in the US. Viktor is very funny in his childlike innocence. Sometimes he reminded me of Mr. Bean. Tom Hanks portrayed Viktor wonderfully. Stanley Tucci is a great actor and he does justice to his role. In the ending scene, you can actually see that he is happy for Viktor. This is the man who did everything to make Viktor's life at the airport miserable. Though nobody will keep an outsider for 9 months in a terminal, it was a good fantasy film. Catherine Zeta-Jones, God this woman doesn't look a day over 25 years; she is so beautiful. She conveyed everything that her character felt through her eyes and tears. I was pretty moved by this film. One can't, but root for Viktor and hope against hope that he gets what he wants. Dolores Torres (Zoe Saldana) is a security authority at the airport and she also has a sweet love story. I recently became her fan after Star Trek and Avatar. She is extremely talented and beautiful. All I can say, this film will not bore for you even for one second and it is very entertaining.8/10",8,7,11,20 May 2010
The Conjuring," The Conjuring doesn't even remotely reinvent the genre, but its a darn good movie.
","In 1971, Carolyn and Roger Parren move their family into a dilapidated Rhode Island farm house and soon strange things start happening around it with escalating nightmarish terror. In desperation, Carolyn contacts the noted paranormal investigators, Ed and Lorraine Warren, to examine the house. What the Warrens discover is a whole area steeped in a satanic haunting that is now targeting the Parren family wherever they go. To stop this evil, the Warrens will have to call upon all their skills and spiritual strength to defeat this spectral menace at its source that threatens to destroy everyone involved.James Wan gets out of his 'creepy doll' playhouse (sorta) and successfully tries his hand at hauntings. The Conjuring doesn't even remotely reinvent the genre, nor does it earn the title of 'the best horror movie ever/of the decade', but based on the hype and incredible positive word of mouth its riding on, one would think it does.Pros: Wan simply succeeds by putting the story before everything else. The cast is filled with good, recognizable actors (whom I very much like). The acting, cinematography and score, especially the sound mixing, is top notch. It didn't feel like there were any unnecessary jump scares and I was totally immersed in the movie. There were a number of genuine tense moments. Not scary (except for one scene where I actually jumped off my seat and it didn't have much to do with the visual stuff), it was just very well done. Also, this is one of those rare times that I actually WANT a sequel for even though I was quite satisfied with the movie.Cons: The movie has nothing new to offer. It feels like you've already seen this movie. The special effects (which are quite minimal) take you out of the moment at times. Some stuff were left unexplained which will bother some people.I don't see trailers (except for superhero and sci-fi movies) or read about movies beforehand so as not to spoil myself. So, some of the things were quite a pleasant surprise of sorts. All in all, a very solid addition to the genre and one I look forward to seeing again in the future.7/10",7,3,7,4 August 2013
Never Back Down," 'The OC' meets 'Fight Club'
","I understand the low rating for this movie, but I thought it was better than a 6.1, probably in the high 6. I had extremely low hopes for this movie before watching it, but it was way better than expected. I am a big fan of both the TV show 'The Oc' and the awesome movie 'Fight Club', this is a combination of both, but far too less effective. I know this movie is a big cliché, but I really enjoyed it. This movie had a TV show feel to it and I liked that. Sean Faris looks like a younger version of Tom Cruise, too bad he doesn't have the same acting ability level. But it might be because of the mole, it is very distracting.Jake Tyler (Sean Faris) is a senior high school footballer who has daddy issues (his father was killed in a car accident) and blows off his steam in random fights: be it on the football field or on streets. He is moving to Orlando with his mother and little brother who has got a tennis scholarship and meets Baja Miller (Amber Heard) in class. He immediately has a thing for her, but it turns out she already has a super-rich, hot boyfriend Ryan McCarthy (Cam Gigandet). Ryan knows that Jake is a hothead who can fight really well. Being a good fighter himself and also the tough guy at school, he challenges him and kicks his butt, humiliating Jake in front of everybody. Jake's only friend Max Cooperman (Evan Peters) tells him about Jean (Djimon Hounsou), a professional who teaches Jake to control his anger while fighting a fight.You know rich kids just create unnecessary drama to make themselves feel important. That is what I have learned in my experience. They show it in this and it is very boring in real life, but the movie is enjoyable. The fights were really awesome and that is probably the reason anybody could watch this. I like Cam Gigandet, he was probably born to play the role of bad guys. With his good looks and acting skill, he could easily play the lead role, but he still plays the bad guy very convincingly. I actually hated him for killing off Marissa in 'The OC'. The film succeeds because of him and he has a real story. I don't have any complaints about the script, except it was too predictable. That was not necessarily a bad thing as the director has tried his best to make this an entertaining watch. Baja Miller is simply a prop for Ryan and Jake, she has no character development (she leaves one hot guy for another hot guy). The background music was good and the locations were superb.7/10",7,2,3,5 June 2010
The Wolverine," Starts off as a wonderful character study, but veers off halfway through
","In 1945, Logan (Hugh Jackman), the Wolverine, is held in a Japanese POW camp near Nagasaki. During the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, Logan rescues a Japanese soldier named Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi) and shields him from the blast. In the present day, Logan lives as a hermit in the Yukon, tormented by nightmares of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), whom he was forced to kill at the end of X-Men: The Last Stand. He is located by Yukio (Rila Fukushima), a mutant with the precognitive ability to foresee people's deaths and is skilled with a samurai sword, on-behalf of Yashida, now the CEO of a technology corporation. Yashida, who is dying of cancer wants Logan to accompany Yukio to Japan so that he may repay his life debt. The moribund Yashida offers mortality to Logan, transferring his gift to him, but Logan does not accept the offer.This movie is completely different from any Hollywood superhero movie. Its also a hardcore and character driven movie. It definitely stands out from the plethora of superhero movies. Halfway through the movie, I was thinking to myself about how surprisingly good of a character study this was even though I could predict most of the story and some of the action was over the top. Then it all went bonkers and the strong first half was ruined by a completely contrived romantic turn. Of course, the white guy has to sleep with the first beautiful girl that he sees in another country and she'd obviously be willing to jump him. I wouldn't really blame the girl though. Have you looked at Jackman! He could probably turn me gay. But, Logan moving on from Jean in such a short amount of time and loving the new girl didn't ring true on any level, especially when he dreamt of her every night and was highly emotional for her. A stupid typical final act destroyed any hopes of The Wolverine somehow veering on to the right path. The villains, Viper and the Samurai transformer, were ridiculously cartoonish and didn't have much purpose for the final fight to take place. The less we talk about them, the better. I'd still like to re-watch this movie someday in the future and see how it holds the test of time.6/10",6,0,1,21 November 2013
Iron Man," An Intelligent, Entertaining Superhero Movie
","Iron Man was coming on TV today and since me and my friends are going to 'Iron Man 2' sometime next week, I watched it to recall the characters and see if I still liked it like 2 years back. I am very happy to say that the second time I loved it even more. John Favreau directed this amazing movie which is one of the best superhero movies ever. I am keeping my fingers crossed, that Iron Man 2 will be a truly worthy successor to this amazing gem. Also, if anybody has a lifestory to tell, Downey Jr. has the ultimate comeback tale to tell. After all those stints in rehab and prison, he came back revamped in a new avatar and 2008 and 2009 were his years. He has become on of my favorite actors now.Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is rich, handsome, intelligent, quick witted, incredibly wealthy and a playboy. He is the owner of Stark Industries which specializes in making warheads for the US military. He is kidnapped by an Afghanistan terrorist group who forces him to help them make his new, modern missiles. But Tony Stark, along with another Afghan scientist who is kidnapped, builds a suit of iron and escapes from their stronghold. Unfortunately the scientist is killed and he returns to his home. He has now seen that his weapons are in the hands of the bad guys and wants to stop the production of the warheads. But Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) advices him against this, because the consequences will be too great. Stane was his father's best friend and a business partner and he is now a major player in the Stark Industries and a close confidante of Tony Stark. Will Tony Stark make a difference in the world with his Iron Man? This is kind of a breath of fresh air to the superhero genre. It doesn't have all the baggages of other superheroes. Tony Stark is a man who enjoys life and he is a ladies man. I thought, what were they thinking by casting a middle aged man like Downey Jr, but that was before I saw the movie. After watching and being enthralled by the story, I accept that Downey was really born to play the role of Iron Man. The underplayed romance between Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Tony Stark works well for the story. Tony Stark changed his views about weapons after seeing what it did to other people who were in the line of fire. He wasn't a born justice upholder like other superheroes and he is a man behind all that metallic gear. This is what makes Iron Man so much more endearing. If the character of Obadiah Stane was played by any other actor other than Jeff Bridges, it would have been simply awful. I didn't even know who Jeff was before this year's Oscar, but I still remember hating his evil persona character back when it released. Terrence Howard plays Stark's best friend Rhodey, who is an officer in the US military and his character is under written. But, I thought he would get a chance to display his acting in the second movie, but they have put some other man in his part and it is so sad that he won't be a part of Iron Man 2. The banter of Stark with his robotic assistants, the freezing of the Iron Man suit and everything except the final battle is brilliant. The final battle is supposed to be like that, so I can't hate Favreau for that.The background score is awesome and the cgi effects seemed insanely real. Iron Man 2 released here yesterday (so sad its releasing late here) and I hope it will be awesome :) 9/10",9,7,12,8 May 2010
Before Sunrise," Realistic, Infectious and Delightful
","Jesse (Ethan Hawke), an American, has been traveling around Europe on his own aimlessly for the past few weeks on his Eurail pass. His last stop, where he is currently heading, is Vienna, from where he will catch a flight home tomorrow morning. Celine (Julie Delphy), a Parisienne, had been in Budapest visiting her grandmother. She is currently heading back to Paris to resume her studies at the Sorbonne. Jesse and Celine meet by chance on the same westbound train out of Budapest. The connection they feel from their short conversation on the train is enough for Jesse to suggest at the last minute that she get off the train with him in Vienna and that they spend time together in Vienna - just wandering around the city as was his original plan as he doesn't have the money for a hotel - before he needs to go to the airport, and at which time she will board the next train to Paris. If it ends up she feels uncomfortable with him as time progresses, she could ditch him at any point. Celine agrees. As they wander from place to place in Vienna, they talk about their philosophies of life and love. They also talk about logistical issues regarding their time, such as why Jesse was in Europe to begin with, what they are feeling for each other, if there is a future for them together and if so what that future may look like taking into consideration both their current lots in life.Who wouldn't want something like this to happen to them? Its a dream come true to realize that you found the love of your life so unexpectedly in the most unexpected of places and clicked instantly. Of course, its near impossible not to stay in connection with each other nowadays, but the setting in the nineties and the characteristics of these people and their beliefs works wonders here. This is a simple story of love set in the beautiful city of Vienna over the course of a night between an American guy and a French girl, that's told in the most realistic, infectious and delightful way possible. The chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy is amazing. You might or might not warm up to Jesse who craves attention and generally has this snobbish attitude but is a romantic inside his heart, but no one, absolutely no one, will not love the free-spirited Celine who may come off as naive, but is so very hopeful and endearing. The sexual tension runs rampant beneath the surface. There are these most inane of conversations about their lives and how they feel about stuff, yet it is scintillating in the hands of these very capable actors who bring such joy, uncertainty, hope and fear to the table. There's no villain, action, slapstick comedy or any of the regular stuff that you expect from movies. The almost loving emphasis on breezy character interaction is quite remarkable. The dialogues flow naturally and is so good that I didn't want it to end. Definitely looking forward to the rest of the movies in the Before trilogy.8/10",8,0,1,3 November 2013
Signs," Not a Typical Sci-Fi Thriller
","This a very good movie . Mel Gibson's and Joaquin Phoenix's characters are not over the top and they are like a real family. Mel Gibson gets to try to portray an understated, confused, and emotionally scarred character. Joaquin also gets play a similar character, though he is less inhibited than Mel Gibson. Their calm, sullen personalities contrast with the unbearable situation they find themselves in. Directed by M. Night Shyamalan, this is one of his best movies and a very underrated one at that. I saw this movie when it was released back in 2002 and I was very impressed and I have seen it quite a few times since then. I didn't even know that the cute little Bo was Abigail Breslin until last night when I was reading her acting credits. I like that girl very much and she is immensely talented.Rev. Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is a former priest who has lost his faith after his wife was killed in a freak car accident. Six months later, he discovers a gigantic crop circle in his yard. Similar events begin to happen all over the world. Graham's children, Bo (Abigail Breslin) and Morgan (Rory Culkin) think it is aliens, his brother, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) thinks it's pranksters, and Graham doesn't know what to think. The crop circles cause a media frenzy and test Graham's faith as he journeys to find out the truth behind the crop circles. When the truth is discovered and it turns out his children are right and the aliens have come to take over the planet, it becomes a battle to save his children from the aliens.One of the reasons why this film is hated by some is the idiocy of the aliens. They can make huge crop circles in the middle of the night without anybody noticing, but they can't break down a door and enter into a house!! Even I was surprised, but not angered. It is like in some vampire movies where you have to open the door and invite the vampires in for them to come inside a home. The direction is amazing and Mel, Joaquin and the kids give awesome performances. Mel Gibson's character doesn't have as much dialogue as his kids have. Abigail Breslin is so cute in the movie. She is a attention grabber even when she doesn't have any dialogues and I loved her. Rory Culkin as the son who has asthma is also quite good. The atmosphere is bleak and they are all alone in their home. They do not contact other people much and this is a major factor in the delivery of the movie. Shyamalan is interested more in the human drama within the family, rather than the invasion itself, that is where he is brilliant. All the built up tensions in the family is being thrown right into each other's face due to the impending apocalypse. The reason for the alien invasion and their subsequent running away to their home planet may have come off cheesily, but it didn't. It seemed very realistic that water could be like acid to these creatures. Though the aliens come in only a couple of scenes, the tension is immense and I got scared a couple of times. The climax when Graham tells Merril to swing away is amazing. The aliens could have destroyed Earth by their weapons and all humans could have been extinguished and they could have won. Or humans could have blasted them away from the skies. Why didn't they do that? That was the problem with this movie. Still, it is brilliant if you do not think about that.8/10",8,3,7,28 May 2010
Identity," An Awesome Thriller
","Whatever I say about this movie regarding the plot will give it away. Still, I will try to explain by trying not to write spoilers. When the twist comes around in the film, you'll eventually figure out the killer if you have seen films like Se7en or Fight Club. This is a notch below those perfections, but still makes an extremely intelligent and engrossing watch. John Cusack is one of my favourite actors and he is extremely talented. He and Amanda Peet were the reasons I decided to check out this movie. Apart from 2012, they have never let me down. This movie is better than most of the films in its genre.Ten strangers with secrets are brought together in a savage rainstorm: A limo driver, Ed (John Cusack), an 80's TV star, Caroline Suzanna (Rebecca DeMornay), a cop, Rhodes (Ray Liotta) who is transporting a killer, Robert Maine (Jake Busey), a call girl, Paris (Amanda Peet), a pair of newlyweds (Clea DuVall & William Lee Scott) & a family in crisis (John.C.McGinley, Leila Kenzle, Bret Loehr), all take shelter at a desolate motel run by a nervous night manager, Larry (John Hawkes) in the Nevada desert. Their relief in finding shelter is quickly replaced with fear as the ten travelers begin to die, one by one. They soon realize that, if they are to survive, they'll have to uncover the secret that has brought them all together. Parallel to this story, there is also the hearing of a murderer who has already been sentenced to death.What if every choice we make was already made for us? What if there really were no coincidences in life & our destinies were already predetermined? I will not give anything away and spoil this for you. The film is only 80 minutes and I thought it was too short. The director, James Mangold could have extended the runtime more. I know it is petty reason when the movie is already as brilliant as it is, but that would have satisfied me more. Nobody in this film look like stars acting in a movie. All of them fit into their character perfectly. The standout comes from Ray Liotta and John Cusack.****Spoiler Alert**** Though I figured out the killer in the beginning, the plot made it impossible for that character to be the killer. So, I thought it must be Amanda Peet or Ray Liotta's character. But, that turned out to be a dud and the director made my first guess the killer. Anyway, its an awesome film. Please don't miss it and don't give away anything to others who haven't watched it yet.9/10",9,3,4,28 May 2010
The Cabin in the Woods," A fantastic deconstruction of the horror genre to its bare bones
","In an industrial facility, two technicians are preparing for their day on an unknown operation. Meanwhile, five friends are preparing for their trip to a remote cabin owned by Kurt's cousin. On the way, they stop for gas and have an encounter with the strange local who owns the gas station. They arrive to find they are quite isolated with no means of communicating with the outside world. When the cellar door flings itself open, they of course go down to investigate. They find an odd assortment of relics and curios but when one of the women, Dana (Kristen Connolly), reads from a book, she awakens a family of deadly zombie killers. There's far more going on however than meets the eye as the five campers are all under observation.I knew absolutely nothing about Cabin in the Woods except for the behind the scenes stuff where it got pushed forward due to MGM's financial difficulties. This is a fantastic deconstruction of the horror genre to its bare bones. Joss Whedon is one of the writers in the movie which is a satirical take on typical slasher/horror movies. Its original, strange, funny and has some surprising moments while all the time embracing its stereotypes. It works as an intriguing puzzle for us to solve for the most part. I didn't particularly care for any of the characters since they were so two dimensional (intentionally as the plot progresses). Chris Hemsworth was forgettable like most of the actors from the core group. Its the other part of the movie that was clearly the driving force for the movie's effectiveness and critiques of the typical modern horror fan (the ancient ones). Its a shame that Amy Acker didn't have more to do since she's a phenomenal actress. For anyone with a sense of humor, this movie will do wonders.7/10",7,0,1,27 October 2013
Law Abiding Citizen," This COULD Have Been BIBLICAL!!!
","'Law Abiding Citizen' opened here in the first week of this month. I was eagerly waiting for it because Gerard Butler, who plays Clyde Shelton is one of my fav actors. I like his acting very much. I loved Dracula, 300, Butterfly on a Wheel, P.S. I Love You, RocknRolla & the more recent, very sexist film The Ugly Truth. Gamer didn't release here, so I have to wait for it on cable.The point is Gerard Butler's portrayal of characters always moves you, whether to a positive or negative for his role is always the viewer's choice. He is one of those actors who manages to pull you into his world (like Johnny Depp, but he's even more amazing).In Law Abiding Citizen, he plays a father whose family is brutally murdered.. I rooted for his character from the opening scene. I won't go into the plot details too much. I didn't even have any issues with the director's twist of him as super-genius. In this 110 minutes roller coaster of a movie, the last 10 minutes is a slap in the face for us audiences. We had been anticipating so much more in the climax, than the lame excuse for a typical Hollywood ending. Aside from the last 10 minutes, this movie rocks & yeah I also didn't like the way they showed how he managed to kill all those people from his prison cell.Butler says to Jamie Foxx's character Nick Rice that 'This Will Be Biblical'. It COULD have been BIBLICAL if the writers didn't get cold-feet at the last moment & made a pathetic ending. My recommendation would be to get out of the theater before the last 10 minutes, so you could go home with a satisfied feeling instead of going home dejected & trying to find all the possible cuss words for the director & writers. 7 on 10 for the very trashy ending. You may have seen that I didn't talk about Foxx or any other characters, that's because you don't give a damn about any of the others. It's Clyde all the way & we love it.7/10",7,5,9,26 February 2010
Up in the Air," Excellent!!
","*****Only minor spoilers***** Ryan Bingham has a job that has him travelling around the country firing people. He lives out of a suitcase as he travels around most of the year & he seems to love it in the air. But, when his company plans to ground him, Ryan isn't happy. He takes Natalie Keener, an extremely vibrant, young woman under his wing to provide her some insights to his work before they can ground him permanently.It deals with the sorry state of the economy last year. How it affected so many people & their families. This film works well on so many levels & the Oscar nominations for George Clooney & Vera Farmiga were well deserved. Even though Anna Kendrick did a very good job in playing Natalie, I didn't think that she deserved a nomination. Don't hate me for that. I love the Twilight films, this has nothing to do with her in those films. The background score really fits the movie well.I loved Ryan's character. Who wouldn't want to be like him (but just for a while though, you do want that someone special with you as you grow up). Jason Bateman also does a good job as the boss of Ryan. Jason Reitman has written & directed a wonderful story about a man who doesn't want commitments in life, who doesn't want to grow up, who thinks of himself as being a free bird. This is one of Clooney's better performances. The film can be watched again & again. I'm glad I watched 'Up In The Air'. This is about family values, how one shouldn't get afraid of commitments & one must be ready to have their hearts broken at some point in life. Vera Farmiga plays Alex, the woman who wants a casual thing with Ryan Bingham. Ryan & Alex are both funny, smart, don't want to be in a serious relationship & just seem to us, as an audience, the perfect people for each other.The one scene I really loved was when Natalie breaks down at the airport & starts crying & Ryan was just so unsure of what to do. I didn't think Anna Kendrick was a good actress before this, but she's absolutely an amazing talented actress. Each scene stays with you, long after the film has ended. The whole thing is good. This is one of those films which has to be in your collection.9/10 -Girish, 20",9,6,11,3 April 2010
