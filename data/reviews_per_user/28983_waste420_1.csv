Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," A Disaster
","OKÂ… I don't know where to begin on how horrible this movie was. I guess I wasn't expecting much from the title, I have seen very bad movies before including ThanksKilling and Troll 2, and both were enjoyable in their own way. So I figured maybe a funny action movie with some bad lines. I could sit through that. Oh no. What was presented before me was Abraham Lincoln's life not only in Lifetime movie drama form but also a way, way over the top action flick. I literally could not stop laughing at how horribly corny and awful most of the scenes were. There was very little plot that wasn't already apparent if you have taken any American History class, which left the film stale, no plot twists or turns. Abraham is 'Honest Abe' the entire movie though somehow becomes this ass-kicking ninja warrior overnight (the montage is hilarious). And the movie is way too long. It covers a huge span of time and by the time you are at the end; you just can't believe it's still going on. I get green screen special effects are neat but this movie relied on it heavily, creating scene after scene that the movie literally had to keep outdoing itself. The action scenes that should have been memorable just weren't because there was way too much going on. Abraham also had very little emotion in his performance, they tried to make him heartfelt in his fight against slavery but it just felt way too forced as with the whole movie. He was in no real danger either; he was almost caught a few times but somehow just got lucky, too lucky to create a real suspenseful movie I think.All in all, I can deal with the history inaccuracies and even the action, the seriousness this film tried to portray just made is god awful corny. I can't describe how agonizing it was to sit through scene after scene of this nightmare of a film. I am horribly disappointed. If it had even a slight bit of humor or maybe dark comedy features, it would have made this a bearable movie. Even if Abe just had some one-liners, I think I wouldn't be so disappointed.Please don't see this movie, unless you want ridiculous way-over-the-top action. I say go for it! But beware of the lifetime overtones.",1,20,44,23 June 2012
