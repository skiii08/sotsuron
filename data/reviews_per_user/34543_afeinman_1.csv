Minority Report," Mediocre rendition of a cunning tale
","While the short story wasn't the best of PKD's work, it had some interesting issues in it, and a clever spiral conundrum at its heart that was basically ignored for the movie, making the title less meaningful than it could be. As for the movie itself, the acting was mediocre, the action somewhat disjoint with the plot (i.e., gratuitous), and the characters' motivations were alternately inscrutable and painfully obvious. It looked like a classic case of fitting a 3 hour script into a 2 hour movie.",6,0,0,12 May 2003
