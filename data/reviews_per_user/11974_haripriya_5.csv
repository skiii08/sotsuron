Sucker Punch," Really hard punch...
","Started watching this movie without any clue and even I don't know who was the director. I came across the fantasy fight scene of a girl against Giant Samurai on Youtube, while searching for some other video. I wanted to see this movie.I was not able to understand the plot or story in the first run. The visuals are stunning. Don't know why it is flopped on Block buster, but it is one of the must watch movie.The girls acted on this movie is fantastic. They do the character very clearly. On the fight scenes they seem pro and unafraid of what ever come. The dance scene and afraid of their master, they show clear emotions. How much training and hard work.",9,4,8,4 November 2017
Interstellar," Interstellar - Indian vedic science, right after The Matrix Trilogy
","Interstellar - Theory of Relativity E=mc2.I explained this lot of time to lot of people, for all of them here is the best way to understand it. Visualization of Expantion and Contraction of Time (wow), a fathers emotion on his failure to return back. Travelling on Time with Love and Science together.An other movie falls into Indian vedic science after The Matrix Trilogy. Matching the other 7 worlds (bathal, Bhu (earth), bhuvar, maha, jana, thapa and sthyaloga). Pleople live in these world have their own Time Expantion and Contraction: example, one Indra's life time is 5000 yrs in Earth time. Everyone questioned this unbelievable writing on Veda's, now see how Christoper Nolan visualized this.A very exciting and emotional Sci-fi movie after, The Moon.",10,3,8,8 November 2014
Justice League," I never rated such low
","This movie had potential to throw lot on screen.The villain of this movie sucks. He is not characterized. They say the mother box was not calling him because of Super man, but now it call because he is dead. Super man was on the Earth for few years only.The villain from X-Men: Apocalypse is far better than this.Batman has not super powers, but he is the leader and no strong scenes for him. In BvS, Batman had the vision of Flash call him and the vision of fighting against the bugs was raising expectations about this movie, but nothing went well.Man of steel and BvS tried to show Super man has a normal super hero (but he is not). Now they try to upraise him. I am 80's kid I know only Super man and He-Man as super hero. DC failed to show Super Man as he is.Main flaw is, how Super man is reborn, it was happening just like that. We where expecting some emotional touch over there. Wonder woman, Flash and Cyborg give some relaxation. Still the antagonist is too week.",4,0,0,19 March 2018
Joker," Theater gone silent in Chennai
","From frame 1 to the end of the movie the entire theater gone silent. Every one was engaged till the end.So dark, they gave 'A' certificate for the movie where the violence were very less than the Deadpool series or literally no nudity or sex scene or no thrilling scene or sound effects. But when we come out we know why a below 18 should not watch this movie.The hype is 100% true.",10,3,6,6 October 2019
Wonder Woman," My daughters fav.
","Gal Gadot is apt to this role. The first appearance on Batman vs Superman gave lot of hype, this movie filled those well. The story is bit slower until we see the Ares, but from there it takes us to the edge of the seat. All the characters from the Queen, Antiope to Ares everyone stand still on our mind. The chemistry between Diana and Steve is nice.",9,4,11,13 October 2017
