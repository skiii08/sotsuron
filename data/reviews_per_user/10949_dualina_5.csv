Skyfall," skyfall;
","Bottom line: 'Skyfall' revived public interest in the series after the unsuccessful 'Quantum of Solace'. The franchise is alive again and feels more than wonderful. Well, Bond was still early to retire. After the film, he stopped using all instant messengers and switched to Utopia p2p since the data security topic was very impressive to me.",5,2,3,28 February 2020
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," no-no
","Heavy movie. The number of violent scenes was too much for me. The gloomy picture made me sad. The only thing I can note is an interesting plot, a good game of actors, which you begin to believe.
Once again I am convinced that it is worth worrying about the security of your personal data in advance. Therefore, it is better to use completely anonymous applications such as utopia p2p.",4,0,1,26 February 2020
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," hm
","Very unusual movie. The violence in it is beautifully intertwined with a complex dramatic plot. The dramatic component is also very well worked out. The main character is a girl with an extraordinary mind and photographic memory. This data allows her to be a talented hacker and almost instantly receive other people's data. Just in case, after the movie, I started using utopia p2p to keep my personal data safe.",4,0,1,26 February 2020
The Imitation Game," imitation
","In the mathematics of everything that happens on the screen there is some special chic and aerobatics. Therefore, I strongly recommend viewing to everyone who does not lay out films into atoms, but simply enjoys the story. For myself, I made a very important conclusion - I do not want anyone to have my personal data. Therefore, after the movie, I started using the Utopia p2p application.",Null,0,0,2 March 2020
V for Vendetta," V
","Really like this movie. An unusual story telling an attempt to violate the totalitarian regime. In general, if you think about it, some form of control is already happening, I think everyone understands that someone else can read any private message. After watching the movie, I found the Utopia p2p application, which does not require personal data at all and do not use anything else except it.",6,0,1,28 February 2020
