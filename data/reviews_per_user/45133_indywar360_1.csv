Marie Antoinette," if you don't like this movie
","there is something wrong with you. Like Marie Antoinette herself, it seems like frivolous fluff considering the events that take place. But it's done so well. And French Revolution be damned, it's about a girl. It kicks ass. Sofia Coppola shows a lot of style, elegance, and intelligence in a work like this, not to mention humanity and tenderness, and knowing something about what it means to be a young woman. Obviously other movies of hers then come to mind, I think I'll watch them again soon.And Kirsten Dunst kicks butt. I was touched by the work she did anyway, all-around, but especially with that Swedish dude, and when she bids farewell to her good friends. Kirsten, you're the man.Oh, and obviously, Jason Schwartzmann as Louis XVI? wtf? lol. Awesome... so freakin' funny.",10,2,6,28 October 2006
