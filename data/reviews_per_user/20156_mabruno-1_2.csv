The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Weird/absurd plot, but an entertaining film nonetheless (Spoilers included)
","'Breaking Dawn, Part 1' reaches new levels of weirdness even by 'Twilight' standards. Whereas previous installments of the series preached abstinence before marriage, the message in BD1 seems to be that sex, even after your wedding vows, can basically kill you ! Not to mention the ludicrous idea that women should put up with a husband or partner who physically hurts them because they love him, or that a woman's future mate should be picked when she is born (i.e. the 'imprinting' nonsense). The author and the screenwriter do not make any effort either to conceal their position on abortion ('it's a baby, not a fetus'), which is not justified in the movie/novel even to save the mother's life ! Bella is actually willing to die rather than terminate her pregnancy, which is plainly insane.Having said that, leaving aside the absurd plot (which is Stephenie Meyer's fault), the movie itself is not as bad as most professional reviewers are saying. As expected, it doesn't have as many cool fighting scenes as 'Eclipse', but I wouldn't call it boring or excessively slow-paced as most other reviewers claim. I am also assuming most of the action will be left to Part 2, where, unlike in the book, we will probably see a much bigger/epic showdown with the Volturi guard.As far as the cast is concerned, as we all know, Taylor Lautner ('Jacob') over-acts and Robert Pattinson ('Edward') can't act (period!), but Kirsten Stewart ('Bella') actually does a better job in BD1 than in previous Twilight movies. Bella's physical deterioration during her pregnancy, the traumatic baby delivery, and her transformation into a vampire are well handled and acted, although the little 'Avatar moment' in the final scene when her eyelids open revealing a red iris is somewhat anti-climatic and predictable. The scene where Bella drinks blood from a straw in a soda cup is likely to be long remembered as a classic though ! Billy Burke ('Charlie'), Anna Kendrick ('Jessica') and Ashley Greene ('Alice') are great as always in the few scenes they have and I had a pleasant surprise with minor cast members who were finally given more lines like Julia Jones ('Leah') and Boo Boo Stewart ('Seth').Finally, Bill Condon's directing is OK, though not outstanding, but, given the bigger budget he had for the movie, we could have seen better CGI and, especially, make-up, which looks awful compared to previous movies. I also agree that the background music was often too loud, overwhelming the scenes. On the much-criticized 'wolf talk' scene, to be fair, it is pretty much how Stephenie wrote it in the book. Bill Condon uses multiple voices talking over each other precisely to illustrate how the wolves' 'hive mind' works. Viewers can appreciate then why Jacob and Leah are so relieved (and glad) that 'it's finally quiet' when they are severed from the pack's telepathic link.",6,6,11,24 November 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Probably the worst Twilight movie
","Breaking Dawn Part 2 is probably the worst of all 4 Twilight movies or, at least, the least enjoyable. I rate it that way mostly due to poor acting (even worse than in the previous 3 installments), low-budget B-movie special effects and Bill Condon's quick-paced, often abrupt editing that gives us a bad patchwork of scenes that are disconnected in time and space. Not even the soundtrack (usually the high point in any Twilight series) could save the movie this time ! Having said that, the now infamous plot twist at the end was actually clever. It gave a plausible explanation to why the movie ends as the book does (in the book itself, it made no reasonable sense at all). If the twist had actually turned out to be real, the finale would have been even better, but I guess it would have been too much for the die-hard fans who would have complained about how the movie diverged from the novel.Of course, in the end, the chick flick dream comes true: Bella and Edward, Jacob and Nessie (plus Alice/Jasper, Rosalie/Emmett, Carlisle/Esme, etc.) happily together 'forever', the last word before the final credits, which deservingly mention all actors involved in the 4-part series. And, as a commercial plus, the finale is open-ended enough to allow Ms. Meyer and/or Summit Entertainment to re-visit these characters any time they want to. After all, 'forever' is a long time. They might just need to recast the lead actors !",3,10,26,21 November 2012
