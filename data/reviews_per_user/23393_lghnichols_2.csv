The Hangover," HANG it on your Shelf....
","the HANGOVER... One Movie that lives up to it's expectations. Staring an unfamiliar cast to the comedy genre, and working on the backdrop of (do-dont-tell) Las Vegas, this combination of booze and 'what to do with your spare time' is a masterpiece of the seriously falling comedy genre.Zach Galifianakis stands as the greatest asset to the films success, a star willing to do whatever it takes for a laugh, and 'WILLING' to carry a baby on set, playing a man who's known for a dangerously 'dumb' mind is classic. Constructed of colorful and often gut-aching characters, ( Mr Chow: 'Watch out for him' ), the progress of the HANGOVER is well structured and plays the viewer perfectly as to what might happen next. Justin Bartha as Ed stands as the 'nerd in us all' and relates to so many men who want to get out and live their life.And Bradley Cooper as Phil; the one who screws it all up.. Losing his best friend Stu is funny enough, but when he actually finds where the groom-to-be really is, plays for an even funnier ending.Compiled to have you laughing and crying, the flow kills in its comedy-fashion and although the film does feature a 'severe' array of frequent language, its done so in a passive matter.Although the setback is found in legend Mike Tyson, starring as himself in a 'relaxed' and potentially skittish manner. Personally, the tiger touch was hilarious, but Mike Tyson really didn't do anything.Best scene however had to be the playback where Mike Tyson shows the boys his video camera from the previous night, catching his tiger being kidnapped and sexually assaulted by the drugged, drunk and ill'mannered boysome-foursome.The HANGOVER is a great film... funny, crazy... and a potential party pleaser..9* / 10*",9,3,6,26 June 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," FORMS a great a movie
","Potentially the winner of 'Best Special Effects of the Year' Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a masterpiece combination of max-adrenaline action, high speed, and in-your-face impact battle scenes. Expanding its previous prestige record, the new box-office hit introduces slick new Autobots and even meaner and stronger Decepticons. But without a doubt, the special effects department take the gold medal of all STAR ratings. Undoubtedly, the realism each robot brings to the screen is enough to repay your ticket with 'excitement'. Unfortunately, the presence of young and genre inexperienced, Shia Lebeouf, lets the movie flow down two STARS from 10... Amazing Movie, 8*/ 10*.",9,1,4,26 June 2009
