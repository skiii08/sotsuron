Sucker Punch," Impressions :)
","When I bought the ticket my expectations weren't high, I assumed that I'll be watching some standard action film with lovely girls and good action sequences but what I got surpassed all of the above and more. In the whole duration of the movie I managed to blink only twice as my sore eyes are so happy to remind me at the moment. The story line is superb, action sequences interwoven with such mastery that they didn't stood out, new actors to me came together better than puzzles and combined with stunning graphic scenery they deliver the best story I have seen in this genre. I believe some my have their views of the matter but in my eyes this one is shame to miss on the silver screen.",10,63,120,24 March 2011
