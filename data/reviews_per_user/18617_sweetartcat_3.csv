Lucky Number Slevin," Great Screenplay
","I've been studying screen writing by tearing apart screenplays while watching the movies. This is a terrific screenplay. It is almost too intricate at times because if you miss some of the dialogue you might miss part of the story. The only weakness it had was that I knew something was up with the Slevin character not being who he said he was because some of the dialogue wasn't logical (he wasn't behaving like someone who was terrified for his life). But that could be overlooked due to the great sets, acting, tempo, twists, and humor. Writing serious scenes with humorous dialogue is an art and I hope we see more movie scripts from Jason Smilovic.",9,2,3,18 October 2009
Across the Universe," Better than the Beatles
","One of the best movies you'll never see! I don't much care for the Beatles or their music. But LOVED this movie. If you like theater, history, and unique ideas and experiences, you'll love this movie. It's going to be a cult classic. Plus, it modernized the songs and I found myself humming them days after I saw the movie.And who knew Evan Rachel Woods could sing?? All of the songs in the movie are sung live. The only songs re-dubbed in a studio are a few that were sung on the street and there was too much background noise. Did I already say that I think these songs are better than the originals...? Unfortunately the movie jumped rapidly out of first run theaters into second runs because the studio gave it zippo support. But, YOU MUST SEE THIS ON THE BIG SCREEN. PLEASE, do yourself that favor and go and see it if it's playing in art houses or on the big white wall at your local park during the summer.BTW - Julie Taymor, the director, also made Titus and Frida, two more really excellent movies worth seeing. She was the brain behind the Broadway version of The Lion King.",10,3,7,5 June 2008
Children of Men," Blaaaa
","We saw this movie tonight. Interesting concept. Definitely a chase movie. Good acting, great sets.I think in 2027 civilization is going to be more worried about the inevitable fall out from global warming.And sadly, the 'war-torn' set reminded me of Iraq.Unfortunately, I never particularly cared about any of the characters. It had good production value, but I'm sort of ambivalent about it. Maybe the younger crowd felt more passionate about this, I wasn't drawn it and always felt that I was 'watching a movie'. 'Oh, it's cool how they moved the camera', 'I don't believe that she would behave that way...', etc.",5,5,8,5 June 2008
