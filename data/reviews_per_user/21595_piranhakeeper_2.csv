Scarface," The best crime drama ever by far!
","This movie delivers in every way that the Godfather isn't but is praised to be. I'm not putting down Godfather but it definitely does not deserve the status it has been given.  It is an above average film for sure but it no way compares to the brilliance of Scarface.Everything is acted perfectly by everyone in this film. The only three flaws I have with this movie are one old man in the riot scene is waving his board pointlessly in the air.  By his actions, you can tell he is being instructed by the director to act according to the action of the scene and is confused.  They really should have removed this extra and shot the scene again because he really sticks out.Another problem is when Montana stabs the former Cuban official, the blood is not realistic for a stab wound.The third problem is the police sirens after shooting the Colombian.  I can't imagine the police know about this and are rushing towards the crime scene without a pursuit ensuing.  They should not have had police sirens here.I loved this film as the mannerisms of each character including minor ones were totally realistic.  Exceptional acting from everyone involved.  This film delivers felt emotions from each character.Al Pacino's acting is, at least, one of the all-time best performances.  The best I have ever seen for sure.  I haven't seen all movies so I won't say it is the best.  He gives a great accent all through the film.  He wisely avoids trying a full Spanish accent but delivers a perfect Spanish speaker who has learned English and is in the middle of adopting an American accent.This movie is one of the few that goes completely over the top while maintaining extreme realism.  One of the things I really enjoy in a film.You also see a lot of Latin American mannerisms and attitudes in Tony's jeolousy and protection over Gina.  Also in his attitude when about to cause harm to a family.  As someone who's spent a lot of time with Hispanic friends, I am amazed at how Al Pacino was so convincing as actually being from Latin America.The violence is extremely realistic even the implied violence.  Although it was famous as the F-word king for quite some time, it did not seem as though they were included just for its own sake as in most movies today.  They seemed consistent with the characters at every point.This movie delivers in both excellent drama and action.  This is one of the all-time best movies ever made, if not the best.",Null,0,0,25 January 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Incredibly bad!!!
","I love the Star Wars Trilogy.  I was really anxious for this movie.  It has so many problems I could list them from now until eternity.Terrible special affects.  The pod races just plain stunk.  The flight patterns and effects seemed like a cartoon.  The underwater city and council were just repeating computer generated graphics.  Totally worthless.The end battle did not seem as a battle at all.  You would think computerized warriors would be able to do more than walk slowly and shoot? Of course, in the Trilogy, you would say there should be computerized warriors and human fighters would not be needed or useful, but the use of human fighters did bring the battles to be realistic looking and not absurdly held back to equal the parties.Inconsistent with the other stories.  Clearly Lucas wrote in the C3PO and R2D2 characters due to audience demand.  C'mon Anakin created C3PO?  Give me a break!  Plus Obiwan did not own R2D2 before!  That was a interesting development in Star Wars that is now twisted in meaning so Lucas could include the droids!*** Spoiler Alert - I don't know if this is considered a spoiler or not, but in case it is, here's a warning ****Weak storyline.  Nothing of dramatic substance happened in this movie. Anakin podracing to win his freedom from slavery really does not build the drama of the Darth Vader characters early years at all!Cameos galore!  All kinds of things were put in this movie as a hidden cameo!  This is a classic sign of movies attempting to offset lack of substance.A Kiddy Movie!  The humor in this movie was definitely for kids.  Despite what Episode I's defenders say, the Star Wars Trilogy movies were never aimed at kids.  They were not children's movies.  They were family movies. There is a huge difference.Jar Jar Binks.  I think everyone elses complaining on this character is sufficient!This movie seemed to be more to satisfy consumer demand for it than by George Lucas's inspiration to make it.  The incredible inclusion of cheap filler in all points show the vision and passion and content of the Trilogy are not what caused this movie to come into being.An absolutely horrible and disappointing film.  If you took the words 'Star Wars' off of this film, it would have been in and out of theatres very quickly.I wanted to walk out almost at every point.  I wish I had.0 Stars out of 10.",Null,0,1,27 January 2000
