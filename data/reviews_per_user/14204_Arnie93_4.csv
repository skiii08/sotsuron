Requiem for a Dream," Work of dark art
","When it came one evening a friend of mine came home with this DVD I was like OK another drug addiction movie.But this a class of it's own, this is great nothing beat its excellent story telling abilities .what can I comment about it's cinematography ,I was like next to wonderland watching it.and there I was crashed back to ground zero with the end.When is the last time I have seen such an honest movie.it is like a slap on each addicts face.very scary way of portraying the evils of society and the moral of the movie comes out to evidently I cannot just explain in words. I can just not be doing a justice if I would not tell about the performances.",9,0,1,20 June 2009
Ready Player One," Loved it.... Spielberg's awesome gift to us.
","This movie made me so nostalgic. I have never been a very avid gamer. But I had my share of games growing up.

I might be going again for this, only this time in 3D.",8,0,1,10 April 2018
Inception," Redefining himself again, Chris Nolan
","Inception by far the best by Christopher Nolan's work. I watched the with a mindset that I would not match Dark Knight but then again where it was Heath Ledger who was the Hero from the movie Dark Knight. It was Chris Nolan was stole the show in this one. Surely the best movie of this year. A movie even when it ends it casts an impression in ones mind, questioning ones belief in reality. This the movie that I wanna own the Blueray disc of when it gets released in DVD. I would give it 9/10. And yes will surely watch it again in the theater the end of this month, just so as to savor this brilliant masterpiece from the revolutionary director Mr. Nolan.",9,1,3,18 July 2010
The Dark Knight Rises," A decent balance of AWESOMENESS!!
","Actually killing somebody and breaking somebody's spirit are different things. bane broke batman's spirit too, but he rose to the occasion, re-discovered what it was to be Batman again, didn't he? if say some psychopath kills some people, terrorizes a city, turns one or two of its leaders/role models - yes, the spirit of the people of that city might break. people might lose hope. but they don't die. period. hope can be reborn. broken spirits can be repaired. but if someone kills all the people in that city, poof! they are gone. ashes. dust. which presents a more real threat? i think the latter. see joker's attack on gotham was a psychological one while bane presented a more real threat. if i am held hostage in my city, i am thrown out of my home and then i have to live under the constant threat of martial law and a nuclear bomb exploding any second, i think my spirit would break. i understand your gripe with bane - he isn't The Joker. but that is the reason why the joker is the best batman villain, if not one of the most iconic villains in entire pop culture. if you walked into TDKR expecting bane to unleash the same psychological warfare on gotham as the joker did, then that was foolish because bane is a completely different animal. The character of Joker and Heath Ledger's performance elevated TDK to a level, which few movies can touch and such magic happens only once a while. TDKR might not be at the same level of TDK but it is a damn good movie. Christopher Nolan has finally given a comicbook trilogy which is on par with some of the most iconic trilogies like Star Wars, The Godfather, LOTR.",9,5,11,23 July 2012
