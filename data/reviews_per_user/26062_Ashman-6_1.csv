Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Excellent special effects, another great chapter
","I saw this Episode I on opening day, and I enjoyed the movie so much I saw it again the following week.  I am a huge Star Wars fan, and I wish we all didn't have to wait another three years for the next installment!  Anyway, the special effects and compositing were some of the best I have ever seen, but the story seemed to not grip the audience as much as the original Star Wars did, it was a bit dull, like it was more showy to impress the kiddies. Also, Jar Jar was so annoying!!  Hope George has learned his lesson from all the negative feedback he's received from his childish character.  Even with these, it was still a great movie, and I'm looking forward to Episode II.",Null,0,0,12 June 1999
