United 93," An excellent film
","The film was nicely done. It didn't place the blame on anyone; it was a mostly a presentation of the facts.The first half was done as if the viewer was an observer and it bounced back and forth between all the different aviation authorities and military as they tried to figure out what the hell was happening. Halfway through, after the terrorists took over flight 93, the action never leaves the plane.I found myself rooting for the passengers. After they charged the cockpit when they were trying to take back the plane, I was saying to myself, 'Get the pilot up there. Come on, you can do it.' The film was so good and the actors so believable that even though I knew how the story ended, I still had hope they were going to be okay.The ending was the most powerful. As they struggled in the cockpit, I was all tensed up with my arms crossed and hugged close to my body. I was bracing myself for the impact. The plane is hurtling towards the earth and just before impact, I plant my feet and await the crash and explosion. Instead, the screen fades to black and silence. For five long seconds there is no sound, no picture, just the sobs of the patrons.",10,1,2,30 April 2006
