Hereditary," Drama that wants to be a horror and then it ends...
","I am writing this no more than a minute since the film ended.
I have not read any reviews prior to writing this, nor have I seen any previews or heard much (if anything) about the film. 
My girlfriend invited me to join her to watch Hereditary this evening. 
I was excited, as I love me a good horror. But that is where my excitement ended. 
I watched it all the way through, however my partner nodded off about 45 minutes in. 
I think I kept watching because due the cast and their fantastic acting, I guess I was expecting something great to emerge from the slow burn story telling. 
The film has a certain air to it, the lighting, the musical score and the cinematography kept me on edge most of the time, other times I was a tad bored and got to 'fidgeting'. At one point I considered stopping the stream, waking my partner and taking her to bed, but then something happened that made me stay. 
This movie had so much potential, but it seemed to get stuck in the drama genre for the majority of the time. It isn't until the final 20 minutes or so that the film adopts a rather haphazard and seemingly rushed horror/thriller feel and then it ends, leaving a void of unanswered questions. 
As a massive fan of the horror genre, I can't say I felt horrified by Hereditary. 
It had so much potential, but didn't deliver in my opinion. 
Give it a go, as the story is interesting, but do not expect anything to rave about. 
I have given Hereditary 5 stars out of 10 primarily for the acting and cinematography.",5,0,1,4 September 2018
