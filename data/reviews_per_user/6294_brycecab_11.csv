Despicable Me 2," One of the best animation movies of the year!
","I enjoyed the first 'Despicable Me' film very much. I was really excited to see 'Despicable Me 2' in the theaters. The first one made me laugh out loud and was heart-warming.The movie was not good, it was GREAT. Even better than the first film. I admired the voice talents of Steve Carell, Kristen Wiig, Steve Coogan, and of course: Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin as the Minions. I loved the story. The humor blew me away especially the Minions. The character, Lucy Wilde, is a perfect character. I enjoyed this movie with my family and we all laughed and felt (a bit) touched.I highly recommend this for the whole family (especially in 3D)",10,1,1,31 January 2014
The Avengers," The best Marvel movie ever!!
","I went to watch this movie in theater with my Dad. Me, my 2 brothers, and my Dad are huge Marvel fans. We enjoyed Thor, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, and everything else. When I heard of the Avengers, I spread the word to my family and friends. We watched 'The Avengers' in a theater with my Dad, expecting the movie to be amazing since it has more Marvel superheroes in one.This movie is the best Marvel movie I watched. The visuals blew me away, the acting was what I wanted from the actors, the humor was perfect and above all the story was magnificent. I enjoyed the performances of Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evan, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johhanson. The way how they portrayed their characters was exactly what I wanted in a Marvel movie. This is very 'PG'I recommend this to everyone who wants to see a funny, thrilling and an amazing Marvel movie.",10,1,3,31 January 2014
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Marvel just keeps getting better!!
","When I heard that Marvel was being bought by Disney, I was kind of nervous. I thought that Disney was going to change Marvel and make it a lot worse than it was before. I was wrong. Having Disney 'own' Marvel just turned out to be a great decision. The Marvel Cinematic Universe just got better. Iron Man 3, and Thor: The Dark World was amazing. And then I heard that they were going to make a Captain America movie that followed the events of The Avengers. I would say that Captain America: The First Avenger was a good film but it wasn't a great one. I am actually a Captain America fan. So I was looking forward to Captain America: The Winter Soldier..The Marvel Cinematic Universe just got better. I mean that Captain America: The Winter Soldier was a huge improvement on Captain America: The First Avenger. What Anthony Russo and Joe Russo did was very revolutionary to me. They were unexpectedly clever in making a great and descent film. I was very excited when I heard that they were going to direct Captain America: Civil War. The cast was perfect. Chris Evans was the one that stole every scene he was in. Scarlett Johansson and the rest of the cast were good too. The story is what caught me. It was revolutionary and one of my favorite scripts of Marvel. The action scenes were very amusing as well. The theme was very different than the other Marvel movies which is what made it enjoyable.Overall, an amazing, action-packed thriller with a lot of fun. I recommend it.",10,0,1,22 November 2014
The Lego Movie," Phil Lord and Christopher Miller's best work yet!
","'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' is a funny, unique and special film for everyone. Phil Lord and Chris Miller knows exactly how an Oscar-worthy animated film should be like. They are the perfect duo when it comes to directing fun and entertaining movies. A few years later, they directed '21 Jump Street', a hilarious and thrilling action-comedy. Phil Lord and Chris Miller are amazing when it comes to switching genres. From a friendly rated-PG animation- comedy-family flick to a rated-R action-comedy blockbuster.'THE LEGO MOVIE' is like the last two movies directed by the duo.......amazing and unique. I love how the movie provides a simple and not too complicated plot which follows Emmet (Chris Pratt), an ordinary LEGO minifigure who is mistakenly pulled into the world of the Masterbuilders in order to help stop an evil tyrant from his diabolical plan.What can I say? Amazing direction by Phil Lord and Chris Miller. They did something similar to what they did with Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, this time, with a lot more ideas and uniqueness. The voice performance of the cast was very splendid. especially Chris Pratt, who made the perfect 'chosen one'. Will Arnett and Liam Neeson did an excellent job providing the voices as 'Batman' and Good-Cop/Bad-Cop'. Morgan Freeman was great too. The script was great too, delivering humorous jokes and a story which does not go too far.All in all, The Lego Movie is the ideal blockbuster that is guaranteed to put a smile on your face.",10,0,4,5 September 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," My NEW favorite Marvel movie!
","I have been a fan of the X-Men trilogy. Especially the ones directed by Bryan Singer. And then, I heard that they were going to make an installment that unites the X-Men and their younger selves. That caught my attention. I loved the cast of X-Men: First Class especially James McAvoy, who brought an outstanding performance. The other cast members did an excellent job portraying their characters. At the premiere of X- Men Days of Future Past, I was so excited.The movie was spectacular, thrilling, and funny at some points. Bryan Singer did an outstanding job. The visual effects and slow motion sequences were extremely amazing. The performances of all the actors/actresses were outstanding, as well. Jennifer Lawrence, Hugh Jackman, James Mcavoy, Patrick Stewart, Michael Fassbender were absolutely amazing portraying their characters. Evan Peters was the perfect actor for Quicksilver. The story was amazing and very unique. All in all, the movie had the perfect combination of visual effects, action, drama and some laughs.",10,3,4,27 May 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Peter Jackson does it again!!
","I am a fan of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy along with 'The Hobbit' trilogy. I enjoyed 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey'. When I heard of 'The Desolation of Smaug', I got really excited to see it because I love Peter Jackson's creations.I watched 'The Desolation of Smaug' as soon as possible. I can tell you that 'The Hobbit: The Desolation Of Smaug' is absolutely fantastic. I love Martin Freeman's performance as Bilbo Baggins. His co-stars, Ian Mckellen, Richard Armitage, Orlando Bloom, Evangeline Lily and the others did a great job portraying their characters. The visual effects were absolutely stunning and the story was perfect. The make-up was quite unique.I cannot wait for 'The Hobbit: There and Back Again'",10,1,8,31 January 2014
Frozen," Truly is the best Disney animation movie ever since Lion King
","From what I have heard, the critics have been misjudging this title from what it looks like, not on what it really is. For me, Frozen is an incredibly amazing film which deserves more than just 2 Oscars.The story is very unique and incredible at the same time. The movie's humor was perfect. The actresses and actor's voice were absolutely astonishing. Now, here is an amazing Disney film that adults and kids will love together. I have to admit, the songs were pretty catchy and wonderful.The film focuses more on a sister relationship that is very emotional and unique. This movie sends out a great message to younger kids about love and care to their relatives.Extremely recommended to everyone who really just wants to see a great Disney movie after all the years.",10,4,13,18 March 2014
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," A heart-warming special
","I saw this movie in the theater with my Mom who was very excited to see this. The story was very interesting. I have watched the trailer again and again. I loved James Thurber's classic story of a daydreamer. When I sat in the theater, I thought the movie would be different. I was thinking that this would be a 'good' movie..I was wrong about thinking this was a good movie. It was a GREAT movie. Ben Stiller's performance here was amazing including his co-stars: Kristen Wiig, Adam Scott, Shirley Maclaine and the rest. This movie was truly inspiring and extremely entertaining. It's Oscar-worthy in my opinion. This is a special movie for those who want to see something inspiring. I know some critics may say this is boring and unoriginal or whatever, I totally disagree. Trust me, you're going to love this amazing film. This is Ben Stiller's greatest movie yet in my opinion.",10,0,2,31 January 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is well..... AMAZING
","I have been a fan of the Spider-Man comics and the Sam Raimi Spider-Man trilogy (2002-2007). When I heard that they were not gonna make the 4th installment of the Spider-Man series, I felt quite down. I loved Spider-Man. He's one of my favorite Marvel heroes. And then they announced that they were going to make another Spider-Man trilogy with a whole new cast, story, and director. I was not that excited because I liked Sam Raimi's work. They even changed the title Spider-Man to The Amazing Spider-Man. I went to see what it was like.Well, I was NOT disappointed. Marc Webb did a good job rebooting the series. I also loved the new actors\actresses. Especially Andrew Garfield. He stole the show. I kind of thought that he's a better Spider-Man than Maguire. Then, they announced they will make a sequel. I definitely had high hopes for the The Amazing Spider-Man 2. I went to theaters to see it.In fact, it was better than I thought. Once again, Marc Webb did an even better job than the first installment. The actors were great at their roles. Especially Dane DeHaan. He made a great portrayal of the Green Goblin. I enjoyed his performance in Chronicle. Jamie Foxx did a great job too. He was the perfect Electro. I just wasn't a fan of Electro's suit in this film but that's not important. The story was interesting and unique at the same time. They did something that made this the best Spider-Man movie to me. It had humor, some emotional scenes and action.Extremely recommended.",10,24,58,20 May 2014
Thor: The Dark World," Marvel does it again!
","After MARVEL'S THE AVENGERS, IRON MAN 3 aired into theaters. My friends thought it would be a disappointment. I had different thoughts. IRON MAN 3 looked very different than the other Marvel movies. I went to the theaters to see if my friends were right. IRON MAN 3 was amazing. Shane Black did an amazing job. Robert Downey Jr. was remarkably great in this film. He did something that he didn't do in the other IRON MAN movies. Overall, the movie was unique and funny at some moments. Then, THOR: THE DARK WORLD came out...I didn't get to catch it in the theaters so I downloaded it. I jumped on my couch and turned the TV on.The movie was absolutely spectacular and just plain awesome!! I mean the effects were so revolutionary that it feels like I'm actually in one of the Nine Realms. I loved the performances by Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman. But Tom Hiddleston did an incredible job portraying Loki. Alan Taylor did an amazing job here. The story was good and unique as well.Hang on, though. This will not be the last you'll here from Thor (and Tony Stark too)..",9,2,3,29 April 2014
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Better than the first (in my opinion)
","I am a big fan of the books. When I heard of the second movie in the trilogy, I was excited. I made my way to a nearby cinema. I sat down and to enjoy.This was a great movie in my opinion. It had a stronger sense of excitement. Francis Lawrence directed this film beautifully. Jennifer Lawrence made her best role in this film. So did Josh Hutcherson. Their supporting actors and actresses; Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, and everyone else were at their best here. i liked the costumes and make-up here. The visual effects were absolutely stunning, the acting was great, the story is good and above all this is quite better than the first.",10,1,17,31 January 2014
