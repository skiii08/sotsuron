Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I thought it was good
","I know there have been hundreds of bad reviews for Star Wars Episode 1 because of many problems, yet I enjoyed it very much. I thought the special effects were phenomenal, Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor were great in their roles as the Jedi, and Darth Maul was really cool. The number 1 problem I thought was the God awful acting of Jake Lloyd as the extremely important character of Anakin. I have heard some things that people said he's supposed to be like that, all nice and hopeful. I still thought his acting could have been better. If you're reading this Jake Lloyd, know I disliked your acting, no hard feelings. This is really the only big problem I thought. I know hundreds of people hated Jar Jar Binks but he didn't really annoy me as much as Anakin. I actually laughed at Jar Jar's comic relief and my 9th grade friend says Jar Jar is his favorite Star Wars character. I did like Jar Jar despite what other people say. I loved the podrace sequence and the climax. Those were my favorite parts. I liked those Battle Droids, but I do think the Stormtroopers were better. The fight with Darth Maul was great. The guy who played him (I forgot his name)was great I was hoping he wouldn't die, but was happy with the movie and its ending all the same. Overall, I give Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace an 8 out of 10. 2 points for plot, 2 points for acting, 2 points for visual effects, 2 points for its cool characters, and 2 points forit being a Star Wars film. That would give it a 10. Minus 2 for Jake Lloyd's horrible acting. Now Episode 1 gets an 8 out of 10.",8,1,2,13 June 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A great film with romance and is visually spectacular.
","Star Wars Episode 2 was a giant step up from episode 1. Special effects are better, acting is better (compared to the God awful acting of Jake Lloyd in Episode 1), and the story is better. Ewan McGregor was an outstanding actor for Obi-Wan. He is one of my favorite actors. Hayden Christensen, while he had just a few exaggerated lines, was awesome as the troubled teenage Anakin that soon becomes the legendary Darth Vader. Natalie Portman was simply great for Padme' Amidala. This movie reminded me of Spider-Man in that it was able to create a great love story combined with visually intense fight scenes. My favorite scenes are when Jango Fett and Obi-Wan fight, when Obi-Wan, Anakin and Padme' are in the arena fighting the monsters, the part when Jango Fett and Obi-Wan are trying to kill each other in the asteroid belt, Yoda's fight with Darth Tyranus, and the climax. A great movie. I can't wait to see Episode 3. This Episode, we'll probably get a glimpse at young Luke Skywalker and Leia. Anakin turning into the evil Darth Vader, and the real Clone Wars. I predict Episode 3 will blow audiences away. It'll be one of the best and most visually intense of the Star Wars saga!",10,0,0,8 June 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," My favorite movie of all time
","The one line summary explains it. This movie is just absolutely magnificent. My breath was taken away. The acting is perfect, special effects are perfect, what they added was perfect. This film is perfect! I have seen it 38 times. I can't wait to see the Two Towers this December. I hope it is as good or better than the Fellowship of the Ring.",10,1,1,6 June 2002
Black Hawk Down," Probably one of, if not, the best war films of all time
","I don't usually see war films because there usually real gory R rated features, which I'm not allowed to see. I was able to see this one though. This film is extremely powerful. The acting is terrific, Josh Hartnett's best role yet. This film really shoes you the graphic ways of war i.e. a man is seen blown in half, yet still alive for some last words. This film delivers a great message of war and the way of the Somalis' way of life and how it will never stop. That the Americans should not have come to fight someone elses war.And along with this powerful message are totally awesome, intense fight scenes of the lost troopers running through the deadly streets of Somalia where there is danger around every corner. A totally awesome war movie that is almost all action and delivers a great message with wonderful performances. 10 out of 10",10,0,0,1 August 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Supported by a background of an all star cast, the unexperienced child actors pull through fine
","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was not a perfect film, but is probably the BEST family movie ever and a very entertaining movie all around. When Chris Columbus decided to make this movie, there were extreme challenges and risks ahead of him. He would need to keep the movie faithful to the book, but would have to cut some stuff out. He would have to get a cast to that looked like the characters in the book since the characters are so vividly described. He had a lot of trouble trying to find the right kids and thousands auditioned. What do we get for a cast? Well, we get Danielle Radcliffe as famous Harry Potter, Emma Watson as the know-it-all, Hermione Granger, and Rupert Grint as the red headed Ronald (Ron) Weasley, and Tom Felton as the enemy, Draco Malfoy. What do all four of these actors have in common? They are very unexperienced actors. Danielle Radcliffe had done Oliver Twist, Emma Watson hadn't done anything, Rupert Grint was once in a play, and Tom Felton hadn't done anything. The best out of them was Danielle. The worst was Emma Watson (which still, she did a good job). So the main actors that Chris got, he did an excellent job.Yet, the background cast is so awesome. Consisting of critically acclaimed actors, Richard Harris as the 150+ year old Albus Dumbledore, Alan Rickman as the hook nosed, evil Professor Severus Snape, Maggie Smith as strict Professor Minerva McGonnogall, Monty Python's John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick, Warwick Davies as the goblin in the bank and midget Professor Flitwick, and Robbie Coltrane as gentle giant, Rubeus Hagrid (Hagrid). Such an awesome cast to help the children actors.Now, what does Chris do to the story? Well, it begins very good with Hagrid, Dumbledore, and McGonnagall dropping Harryoff at the Dursleys' and zooming forth a years to when Harry is 11. It begins good but they don't develop the characters too well. They add some things I didn't  like.
Either way, it's a good movie.",8,0,0,17 August 2002
Signs," TOTALLY INCREDIBLE!!! Hilarious, heartbreaking, horrifying! Scariest movie I've ever seen!STUNNING CLIMAX! 9 out of 10!
","I have not seen The Sixth Sense, but I have heard enough about M. Night Shymalan to know he could be the next Spielberg. I have seen Unbreakable and I thought it was terrific. I'm still waiting to see the highly praised Sixth Sense, but I saw Signs (twice already). Signs is the best movie this year in my opinion. Better than Minority Report, Spider-Man, better than K-19 (which are some of my favorites this summer). The movie begins with the appearance of crop circles in former reverend, Graham Hess's (Mel Gibson) farm. His children, Morgan Hess and Bo Hess, are terrified and confused by them and their dogs begin acting strange, as if they sense a predator. They try to shake off the shock of the signs but the children become obsessed with aliens and it soon rubs off onto former baseball star Merill Hess (Joaquin Phoenix), Graham's brother. Six months before the movie opens, Graham's wife died and he's lost all faith in God (just a big part of the movie). From then on you are frightened out of your mind with nerve wracking intense scenes and jump scenes.This movie was the scariest movie I've yet seen. Even scarier than the rather ridiculous 'The Exorcist'. This movie has the three H's. It's Hilarious, Heartbraking, and Horrifying. The only thing that keeps it from getting a perfect 10 is this: When they actually showed an alien, it didn't scare me. The scene was intense but the aliens aren't that scary. That's just me though. People in the audience were screaming their lungs out. The climax was incredible though.
We had a great audience. People cheered when an alien was (spoiler!) getting the Hellen of Troy beat out of it. People were laughing, people were crying, and at the end, their was an applause.Great movie, 9 out of 10.See it or be disappointed you didn't!",9,0,3,8 August 2002
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Horrible
","This movie consisted of some of the most unfunny British humor I've ever seen. I didn't find it funny at all. The only good thing about this movie was that it was accurate in depicting Medieval living conditions and such. Otherwise, I couldn't wait for it to end. I kept waiting for it to get funny, but it didn't. For a real spoof movie, check out a great one like Spaceballs.",1,12,51,8 June 2002
