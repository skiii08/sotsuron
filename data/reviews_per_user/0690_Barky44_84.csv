Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Not as good as the first
","While I thought Kill Bill Vol. 1 was a tremendously entertaining film, I was less than enthusiastic about Vol. 2.Problem #1 was the casting and performance of Darryl Hannah as the second-ranking assassin under Bill. I just didn't find her particularly interesting or menacing. True, she was dispatched with aplomb, but it wasn't that enjoyable. Perhaps it was her set-up: in the first film the final 'baddie' was a leader of the Japanese Mafia, someone who not only had to be tracked but who had a cadre of obstacles protecting her. This built up great tension and excitement and made the payoff fight more interesting. Darryl Hannah's character didn't have that big build-up, there wasn't much of a reason for her to be menacing at all.Problem #2 was the unsatisfying way the final confrontation with Bill was portrayed. To me, it was a let down. Sure, how he finally meets the Bride is a bit surprising, but again, there was very little menace in that confrontation. Tarantino makes a great choice virtually eliminating the violence by that last encounter (by then you tire of it and want something different), but his attempt at bad-guy 'mind games' falls way flat, becomes uninteresting, and lets the viewer down.Sure, there's some good stuff in this film, the best being The Bride's training under the ancient Kung Fu master. But overall, Kill Bill Vol. 1 is more entertaining.7 out of 10 Barky",7,1,4,9 December 2005
In Bruges," Very Good Second Work for McDonagh
","'In Bruges' is writer/director Martin McDonagh's second film (the first being 2004's 'Six Shooter'). I never saw the latter, but I saw the former last night, and it is a very good, very entertaining movie. McDonagh still has something to learn about writing, but he's nearly there, and I think I should have to keep an eye on IMDb for further works by this guy.'In Bruges' is a great collection of well-crafted sequences. First is the opening exposition on Bruges itself, a doddering old medieval town which Irish felon Ray (well played by Colin Farrell) despises outright. His entire commentary on frumpy tourist towns early in the film is hysterical and quite accurate (I've been to a lot of frumpy tourist towns and thought most of what Ray says more than once).The film continues on with other hysterical scenes, like Ray's encounter with obese Americans (this film is quite hard on America, actually, but I didn't mind one bit). There's also a botched robbery, where typical tourist-town criminals try to roll Ray for cash, and get far more than they bargained for.The film then moves on to introspective moments. Here is where Farrell's co-star, Brendan Gleeson, comes to the fore. He plays a quiet career criminal with a conscience, concerned for the future of Ray's very soul. I can't go into detail without announcing spoilers, but these scenes are good, too.Then there's a great closing sequence where the astoundingly profane crime boss, fantastically played by Ralph Fiennes, catches up to the two hit men for a big showdown in the doddery village.There are so many great moments and characters in this film, I couldn't really type them all up. But here's a quick list: a one-eyed thief; a racist dwarf; a goofy European movie set; a tourist trap ticket-taker who takes his job waaay too seriously; a beautiful local drug dealer; horse tranquilizers; a vulgar phone message; and a pair of smoke-phobic Canadians.My one and only problem with this film is the overall writing. As I said, there are a lot of great sequences in this film, and a lot of great dialogue. However, there's something not quite right with the structure of the piece. It has been said that the two toughest parts about writing a story are the beginning and the end. McDonagh seems to have trouble with beginnings, this film is quite fragmented up front and takes a while to build up steam. I found this quite distracting. He also doesn't really segue well. Sometimes you're wondering 'why did we move to this scene?', although once you do get there, you love what you're seeing.I think McDonagh is well on his way, though, for these flaws are something that can be overcome given adequate effort and experience. Overall, I liked 'In Bruges', and recommend it for those who like goofy criminal capers with a heart.",8,3,7,24 February 2008
Unbreakable," Plodding, uninteresting, forgettable
","Going way back, I felt 'The Sixth Sense' was a brilliant piece of film-making. I believed that M. Night Shyamalan had some real talent.I missed 'Unbreakable' during its first run. I saw 'The Village', which was horrible, and 'Lady in the Water', which was at least entertaining.Looking for some signs that Shyamalan was, indeed, a talented writer/director, I reached back to finally watch 'Unbreakable.' What a completely uninteresting film.The real problem is Shyamalan spends so much time trying to make this familial bond between the hero, his estranged wife, and his son, that he saps any possible tension or excitement or wonder out of this film. During most of the film, we just see these three characters mope around. There isn't even any real character development going on here, just three horribly depressed characters shuffling through life.Well, there's four horribly depressed characters, because Shyamalan throws in the wise comic book collector, who's also depressed because he's prone to injury. Gads, there wasn't a single interesting character in the entire film. Shyamalan really fails to create any connection between these characters and the viewer. There's no engagement, no interest, nothing.And without having characters to care about, the rest of the movie falls absolutely flat. In a thriller, you can't have tension if you don't care about the people in jeopardy. And he does a terrible job with the tension he does try to create. There's one completely pointless scene where 'our hero' thinks he finds a terrorist at a football game, but the guy is just a nobody who gets let go. Where is the tension in that? Yes, there's a scene towards the end involving criminals that's fairly well done, but by this time you've invested over an hour watching uninteresting people, this one sequence is hardly enough to redeem the film.To make matters worse, the Shyamalan-customary 'twist ending' is so completely uninteresting as to be a non-event by itself. And that was the big climax! 3 out of 10 stars, this film has practically no redeeming characteristics. The score isn't that bad, and the aforementioned criminal scene is somewhat watchable. Not as bad as The Village, but pretty close.",3,1,2,6 March 2007
Memento," Brilliant. Absolutely Brilliant.
","'Memento' is the most original, fascinating, expertly crafted piece of film-making that I may have ever seen. I was absolutely blown away by the sheer brilliance of the concept and the execution.What an amazing piece of writing and filming. To take a preposterous, and often overdone concept (witness all the amnesia flicks of the 50's & 60's), and from that, craft something that can only be described as amazing, is a feat of raw genius rarely seen on screen in this day and age.This film MUST be required watching for not only all film school students but any student of literature or even English Composition 101.Very impressive, very entertaining, very remarkable.10 out of 10 Barky",10,4,9,9 December 2005
Amistad," Powerful for Images of Slavery, but Only a Fair Portrayal of Legal Battle
","I am a fan of historically-based dramas. I enjoy the genre, and Amistad did not disappoint me. It is well shot, the look and feel is quite right, and it pulls no punches in its cruel depiction of the slave trade.Amistad shows this terrible business better than any other film I've ever seen. It portrays all the horrors: the capture of Africans at the hands of rival tribes; the abusive loading of slaves onto ships; the deplorable conditions; the murder and violence conducted in the name of economics; the hopelessness of the slaves' position; the crass indifference felt by the traders, auctioneers, owners and passers-by. Spielberg pulled few punches, only darkening the worst scenes to keep it from degenerating into some Rob Zombie horror film (thereby retaining an audience).The film also does a good job with the portrayal of the heroes, the slaves who fought for their freedom aboard the schooner Amistad. You can really feel their anger, confusion, and frustration as the events unfold. They are a people pushed from one holding cell to another, subjected to trials and procedures incomprehensible to them (both for language barriers and for the inanity of it all).One part the filmmakers did a fine job with was the communication barrier. Some of the best scenes involve the ignorance of the Connecticut gentry as they stare blankly at the Africans as they speak their tongue; incompetent linguists stating the obvious and disguising it as 'science'; lawyers trying to figure out the slaves' stories; and finally the leader of the escaped Africans declaring 'Give us free!' That part really stood out for me.There are a few criticisms I can lay upon this film, however. Firstly, they didn't do that great of a job in portraying courtroom drama. Filmed in '97, this film predates some great television courtroom dramas (Law & Order, The Practice). Much of what happens in court is either boring or confusing or pointless. I think if Spielberg was able to study some of these great courtroom dramas, these parts would have had a lot more 'punch'. Having said that, Anthony Hopkins did some fine delivery as John Quincy Adams...Another element I disliked was the clumsy interweaving of the 'Big Slavery Picture' elements. There's a scene at President Van Buren's state dinner where Senator John Calhoun of South Carolina shows up and makes threats of civil war. The scene was really just thrown in there to try to put in some jeopardy, but the film was doing just fine without that. The intrigue between Van Buren and the Spanish girl queen was really nice, however (a very young Anna Paquin!).The last element that didn't work too well was Morgan Freeman's character, Joadson. He really comes across as little more than an extra. He's such a fine actor, the script doesn't do him justice.For the most part, this is a fine, and important, film. It just misses a few marks that would have made it a great film.8 out of 10.",8,38,48,12 February 2006
The Hunger Games," God-Awful
","'The Hunger Games' is the amateur film of the simplistic screenplay based on the teenage fanfiction for the highly derivative novel by the marketing major. At least that's what it looks like. It's Awful with a capital 'A'. I continue to be amazed that insipid, sickly-sweet pablum like this continues to be made with any seriousness.The whole thing seems like a joke on it's own audience, a twisted experiment by Hollywood to see how bad they can make movies before the audience simply abandons them. Based on this experiment, it seems they can make them pretty damned bad.Here are some of the plot points in this mess:-- A world starving so badly the answer is to pit children against each other in battles to the death? -- Rich parents train their kids to fight these battles on purpose? Seems to me rich parents keep their kids OUT of battle :coughIraqcough: -- Computers can create matter out of 3D images? Yet people are starving? Make some, like, you know, FOOD!! -- My Little Pony fashions will become the norm? -- Beard trimming by Mandelbrot? -- Flames that don't burn? -- Magic cake-decorating powers? -- Woody Harrelson not stoned to the bejeezus?? This film is an unwatchable mess. Unless you're stoned, perhaps. That's it, next time it's on the ballot, I'm voting to legalize marijuana. At least then I might not regret watching movies like this.",1,11,13,31 December 2012
Mississippi Burning," An important film, but fails to connect with its characters
","Mississippi Burning is probably the most important film to come out in 1988. It is a fictionalized account of the murder of three civil rights activists by the Ku Klux Klan in 1965, a tragic, yet important, period in American history.I only wish the film itself were better.The key problem with this film is the character connections. I just didn't feel connected to any of the characters, they all seemed fairly shallow. Gene Hackman's bad cop, William Defoe's good cop, Francis McDormand's bullied housewife, even Brad Dourif's treacherous deputy sheriff, none of them really had bit of magic required to make the viewer connect with the character. I don't think it's the acting, they all tried to do the best with what they had. I think the fault lies with the writing.I think the writer made a mistake by including too much interaction between the two FBI agents (Hackman & Defoe) and not enough into the interactions between them and the locals, and between the locals themselves. Frankly, the film relies so much on stereotype to create these characters, it's hard to get into them.I also feel they shortchanged the black cast members. They're basically relegated to being beaten around, and singing at church. There's only one important scene involving blacks, the lynching of a father who's only trying to save his cows. Otherwise, they're simply window dressing.I would love to see this film remade by a talented writer/director. Perhaps Spike Lee would love to exchange his New York City backdrop for a deeply Southern one. Now THAT would be a film.8 out of 10. It's still an important story, and a risk for Hollywood, and it deserves props for that. But it could have been better.Barky",8,3,5,15 June 2006
Shaun of the Dead," We always knew zombies were funny!!
","At last, someone has taken the only logical step with a zombie movie: made a comedy out of it!! We always laughed at the campiness at Dawn of the Dead and other such flicks, the filmmakers have made the natural progression to romantic zombie comedy.For zombies are not incredibly scary. Yeah, they eat ya, but you pretty much have to be nailed to the floor for them to catch you.Shaun of the Dead has taken this approach with the zombie flick, and has done it to tremendous applause! This film is funny, satirical, a bit tender at times but very entertaining. It is the best approach to a zombie film I have ever seen.It also shows that comedy is not dead, it's just American comedy that's dead. The Brits have continued to 'nail it', from Monty Python to the original 'Who's Line is it Anyway?' to 'Office Space' and now 'Shaun of the Dead'.Hollywood can learn something about how to make funny movies from these cats.9 out of 10. There is a bit in the middle where it slows down too much, but beyond that it is a classic.Barky",9,3,7,2 October 2004
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," The Best Musical Comedy ... Ever!
","This movie, as irreverent, gross, & perverted as it is (well, it is South Park...), is by far the best musical comedy I have ever seen, period!Not only does it have the typical S.P. vulgarity, all told by supposedly innocent third graders. Not only does it have the bizarre characters of Chef, Mr. Garrison, Mr. Hat, Mrs. Brozlovski, and the rest, but it's also a musical! And a thumping good one!I grew up on musicals, my mother being a big fan. I, of course, found them repulsive. But there is a certain pattern, a specific style about musicals, and this film parodies them all! You have the grand opening number, the tender love numbers, the dance numbers, even the flash-card summation montage containing all the bits of the other musical numbers. Anyone who's seen musicals of any type knows these patterns, and here the creators of South Park have them down pat!I laugh outrageously every time I see it. Sure, it's vulgar, but it's vulgarity with proper hysterics and silliness. This is a keeper, highly recommended for pretty much anyone with any sense of humor (and a willingness to laugh at yourself ... these guys insult pretty much everyone).10 out of 10!Barky",10,5,6,18 October 2004
Spider-Man 2," Best comic book movie ever!
","Wow, what a movie!I liked Spiderman 2 a lot. It has a lot of elements that are rarely, if ever, present in a comic book movie:-- interesting characters -- real-world problems (Spiderman has to pay rent, too) -- true ensemble players, not just the hero and extras -- decent actingIt also has all the bells and whistles one would expect from such a movie: chases, fights, explosions, special effects, fast pace. The battles between Doc Ock and Spiderman are intense and visually stunning (the multiple arms are played up terrifically).I only took one point away for a silly, pointless plot element regarding Spidey having problems with his powers. Was really out of place and made no sense.I also didn't particularly care for Aunt Mae, I think she was better in the first.But overall, an great film. 9 out of 10

The Mummy," Campy, but a lot of fun!
","The Mummy is an effects-laden re-manufacture of the classic Mummy tale. It's an action movie, not a horror movie. Although there are some creepy parts, by an large this is a standard, shoot-em-up, monster movie. And that's just fine.When you take it for what it is, it's a lot of fun. The visuals are stunning, the effects are enjoyable, the action keeps you on the edge of your seats. The whole film has a fast pace to it, but not overwhelmingly so.But the best part of the Mummy is the characters. They're a lot of fun, and easily make up for any flaws in electronic gimmickry. Brendan Fraser as the hero, Rachel Weisz as Evie, & John Hannah as Jonathan are a perfect trio, they bring a great deal of humor and just the perfect amount of campiness for a movie of this type. They, and the supporting cast as well (including the American tomb raiders, Kevin O'Connor as the sleazy desert guide Beni, and especially Omid Djalili as the Warden, are THE key reason to see this film.I love this film, and grab it off the DVD shelf every now and then when I'm just looking for some plain, old-fashioned entertainment.9 out of 10 Barky",9,0,0,28 March 2005
Troy," An excellent retelling
","Troy is a retelling of the ancient Iliad by Homer. The story is familiar: Paris of Troy abducts Helen, wife of Menelaus of Sparta, brother of King Agamemnon. Agammemnon gathers all the armies of the city-states of Greece and sets sail in a thousand ships to sack Troy.Director Wolfgang Peterson has crafted an excellent retelling of this story. Not only does he get the look and feel of the epic poem (including the arms and armor and even the nudity), not only does he craft horribly wicked battle sequences, but he actually tells the stories of the characters.
In so many movies today the characters and plots take a back seat to the action sequences. Peterson has done a great job balancing all of this. The filmmakers also give good screen time to the stories of Achilles vs. Agamemnon over Briseis; the fondness Achilles has for his cousin Patroclus; the loyalty between Hector and Paris; Paris' love for Helen; Agamemnon's general greed. You can actually feel Priam's pain as he begs Achilles for the body of his dead son. Sure, he left out the rivalries between the gods, but their absence does not detract from the film at all (IMHO it enhances it).The only issues I have with this film were a few implausible elements here and there, and a performance by Brad Pitt that stumble for the first 30 minutes. It takes that long to get used to him in the role of the great warrior.I am very pleased with this movie. 8 out of 10.",8,5,10,16 May 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Ridiculously implausible
","What a ridiculous flick.Global warming leads to ice melt which leads to the cooling of the Gulf Stream. OK, fine, there's some plausibility in that.But sudden supercyclones over the northern hemisphere with eyes so large and powerful they suck supercooled air from the upper troposphere and freeze the planet in 48 hours? Gawd that's totally unrealistic.There are other events like tornadoes in LA and a massive surge of ocean water that floods NY that make no sense and are left completely unexplained, they are only there for 'shock and awe' factor.It's films like this that give the environmental movement a bad name.The only redeeming factor for this movie was some of the effects sequences, especially the freezing ice chasing after the heroes of the film. But notice I say 'some', other effects really stank (like the CGI wolves).I won't even bother to mention the bad acting. The actors of Twister deserve Academy Awards next to the pathetic performances (by even such luminaries as Ian Holme) in this film.3 out of 10, and I'm being gracious.Barky",3,0,1,5 September 2004
Zodiac," Wow, what a GREAT movie!
","Phew, wow. Just finished watching Zodiac, and I have to say that it FAR exceeded my expectations!Frankly, I wasn't sure what to expect. 'Zodiac' popped up on my Netflix 'recommended' list for unknown reasons. I had heard good buzz about the film, although I don't remember it being out. So I said 'meh' and rented it.This film has reminded me of what good, suspense drama is all about. It has literally renewed my faith in the genre.I don't want to over-analyze the film, because I think that might ruin it, but here's a quick list of what I found appealing about the film:-- Its pacing and tension is reminiscent of some of the dramatic elements of great 60's/70's crime dramas like Serpico and Bullitt.-- Yet it tells the story without any great car chases or shoot outs. This is a VERY good thing, for you find yourself absorbed into the story without being shocked out of it by noise.-- It is even filmed using 70's era lighting techniques. It looks like you're watching a classic, but it was filmed in 2007! This SO suits this film.-- The characters are gritty and real. No pretty boys or hot vixens. This helps absorb you into the story.-- The acting is top notch. These folks do what good acting is supposed to do: makes you forget these are actors, even though some of them have big names (one exception: Brian Cox does come on a bit strong as attorney Melvin Belli, but actually, he ROCKS this performance, because it's supposed to be over-the-top). The cast is quite stellar in this.-- It keeps you guessing all the way through, but it also doesn't lose you in vagaries. The writers aren't TRYING to lose you, they're just telling a complex story and asking you to keep up. Kudos to them.-- It does not overburden you with heavy detail like some murder mysteries. Instead it portrays the illusion that the CHARACTERS are overburdened with detail. This is a huge plot point and very well played. There are no deus ex machinas here, you can tell the characters earned every bit of their successes (and failures). -- There is enough creep, gore, and suspense to keep you adequately 'wierded out'.I tell ya: I really liked this flick. Makes me have hope for movies again.",9,2,3,30 November 2010
Hotel Rwanda," Powerful -- Not Just a Political Message
","Hotel Rwanda is a great film. Yes, it has direct ties to a very heart-wrenching part of history, but what makes it powerful is the strong performance by Don Cheadle, an excellent supporting cast, great direction and storytelling.I love movies like this. I very much enjoy movies with historical settings, even if their not always accurate (not a problem with this film). But anyone can make a drama based on historical events. What matters to film is the event gets the proper focus and circles around a handful of important characters. 'Hotel Rwanda' does just that: it shows the Rwandan genocide as it occurs within a few square kilometers with the hotel as a focal point. More importantly it shows the tragedy through the eyes of a handful of people (if you focus solely on Cheadle and miss the viewpoint of the main character's wife and children you miss a great deal). This is how great historical dramas are made. Look at 'Patton', one of the best WWII films ever made, not because it showed the action any better than any other WWII movie, but it focuses on a single, strong character brilliantly played. 'Hotel Rwanda' is such a movie.A great film, great performances (Cheadle was robbed of an Oscar on this one), and a powerful story. 'Hotel Rwanda' should be shown in high schools across the country come fall.9 out of 10. Sometimes it was hard to figure out which side characters were which (perhaps that was the point based on the whole Hutu-Tutsi past), but that is only a small nit. Otherwise the film is excellent.Barky",9,1,1,31 July 2005
Crash," A Bold Look at Racial Perceptions
","'Crash' could be considered as one more film trying to throw racial prejudice into our face. There have been many films out there that try to preach to an audience about racial intolerance in a bigoted America.If you blow off this film because this is what you think it's about, you'll really miss out on a good film with good writing.What makes 'Crash' so good is it's the first film I've seen that really digs at racial 'perceptions', not race 'relations'. After all, in life the perception comes before the relationship. The filmmakers recognize this point and go right at the heart of it.We are shown an upper-class white woman see the Hispanic locksmith as a potential criminal. We see the Iranian shopkeepers treated as Arabs. We see the working woman accuse the Asian wife of not speaking English (to which the latter retorts 'I am speaking English, you :expletive:.' This whole film is like that: a myriad of differing viewpoints. The director changes viewpoints so frequently yet so flawlessly. He shows the world through black eyes, through white eyes, or through Hispanic eyes, all without confusing the viewer. But he doesn't stop there (that would stereotype far too much), he also manages to rotate through class structures, through religious beliefs, and through various degrees of morality.If you allow it to happen, the effect is to alter your perceptions of race and humanity. There isn't only one view of the world (your own), there's billions of viewpoints, all as real as yours. This is real life (amplified for drama by the movie industry, to be sure, but real life nonetheless).Continuing to mimic real life, there's no big story of racial tolerance in 'Crash', no big 'group hug' between the white man and the black man that redeems the characters in the end. Like a car accident, the participants fill out their paperwork and go their separate ways, never to meet again, never to learn anything from each other. Just continuing on as before. It's not the normal Hollywood ending, but it's by far a more honest one.It may be far too much to ask of a film of this sort (it simply isn't a film for the masses), but hopefully a few people manage to change their own perceptions after seeing 'Crash'.9 out of 10. There are one or two plot elements that are simply unoriginal ('I need to shake hands with a black man to get elected' -- oh brother), but other than that it's a very good film.Barky",9,0,7,3 June 2005
Pan's Labyrinth," 24 Hours Later ... Still Not Sure What to Make of It
","It's been over 24 hours since I saw Pan's Labyrinth at the local Googleplex. I'm still not sure if I liked it or not. I'm giving it a good grade (8 out of 10) because it is wonderfully shot, and has great art direction, cinematography, and set design. It's also very well acted and directed, and it's not pretentious or overbearing or simplistic or goofy.I guess it just didn't connect with me, like it's apparently connected with thousands and thousands of true fans. I'll try to describe the reasons why in a couple of paragraphs, but I doubt they'll be able to capture my antipathy properly.First, this isn't really an 'adult fantasy film' as some have ascribed. It really is about kids, namely a girl who's stuck in a horrible position (forced to live with the cruel captain who married her mother). The film shows how kids in terrible situations can often mentally retreat into various fantasies, in this case a realm of fauns and fairies. So why did they give it an 'R' rating and market it to adults? They should have cut down the violence a bit (it's not gratuitous, the extra notch of 'R' rated violence doesn't markedly propel the plot) and gone for a PG-13 rating. This way, it would have been actually directed at kids (albeit older ones).As a reference point, consider what Stephen Spielberg did with his classic 'Empire of the Sun.' That, too, is a story about a kid caught in terrible circumstances (namely imprisonment in Japanese-held China during WWII). That was a PG-13 film, and shot through the eyes of the child, instead of through the eyes of the adults around the child. Something about 'Pan's Labyrinth' doesn't ring true because of this. We're seeing a young girl's fantasies, but we are constantly torn back to an adult viewpoint. As a result, we never see this young girl grow and understand (and the evolution of a character is a prime force in cinema). If the director had kept us looking through her eyes, our sympathy for the character would be larger.I think that last paragraph was quite convoluted, so I'll try to re-phrase the main problem of this film. 'Pan's Labyrinth' does not maintain the cohesive point of view throughout the film. Is this film about a bad world shown through the eyes of a child, or is it a film about the fantasies of a child shown through the lens of the real world? It's this lack of viewpoint cohesion that leaves me cold.8 out of 10.",8,7,14,28 January 2007
Final Destination 2," Shouldn't have bothered -- the first one was so good by itself
","Ah yes, the curse of all decent teen slasher flicks: the unimaginative sequel.For the most part sequels are the bane of film. For every 'Empire Strikes Back' you get ten 'Final Destination 2s'.Sequels work like this: producer A has run out of ideas. So instead of trying to get imaginative people to bring good ideas to the studio (an expensive process), they simply rehash something that had success in the past (a cheaper process). They find one of the stars from the first one, usually one of the weaker talents (all the good people went off to do real projects). They get a hack writer to throw together a screenplay almost wholly contrived from the first one (I hope it at least pays their bills). Then they film it in the fastest time possible, super-size it with a made-for-MTV soundtrack, and send it out. Raking in the cash from teenagers with disposable income is the easy part.I just realized that I've been typing for a while and haven't really talked about the movie. It sucks. Rent something else.4 out of 10.Barky",4,0,0,5 June 2005
Shutter Island," Great little mind warp of a movie
","I'm gonna try to write a completely spoiler-free review of 'Shutter Island'. Movies like this absolutely demand that you do NOT know what's coming next, and I really hope folks don't read spoiler reviews before seeing SI.Let me start by saying this is NOT a horror movie, contrary to what the trailers suggest. This is Martin Scorcese's take on the Hitchcock suspense thriller, and a thumpin' good one. It follows a lot of Hitchcockian beats: unsettling beginning, that feeling something isn't quite right, with enough action sequences to keep you distracted from what's REALLY going on. Hitch would be a fan of this movie.Let me also say that Leo DiCaprio does some really good acting here. He plays a U.S. Marshall dispatched to an insane asylum to track an escaped prisoner. He ends up wrapped in the madness himself, trying to separate madness from reality, conspiracy from banality, truth from fiction. DiCaprio is incredibly convincing even when you're not convinced what you're seeing is real.The supporting cast is quite stellar: Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo, Jackie Earle Haley, and that master-of-the-creep Max von Sydow. There's even a surprisingly gruesome cameo by ... well, that would be spoiling :-). Now sometimes their acting is flat & unconvincing, or is that exactly the effect Scorcese wants?? Hmmmmm.....I have to throw in some kudos to the location scouts and set designers. Shutter Island itself is wholly part of the cast and crucial to the success of the film. How they managed to find this place ... incredible score on their part! So now for the negatives, the reasons I don't give this a full 10. The script does have a couple of plot holes, but because the theme is 'truth or madness', they're mostly forgivable. There's also a definite sense that you've seen this story before (this is not 'Memento', a film that was truly unique). And they did struggle a bit at the end (honestly, I don't know if there COULD be a wholly satisfying end for the story). But even this is forgivable, because films like this are DEFINITELY about the journey, not the destination.8 out of 10.",8,1,4,20 February 2010
Empire of the Sun," Brilliant, beautiful, poignant, touching
","Empire of the Sun is such a terrific movie. It is a shame it never received the accolades it should have. I'll never understand why, even today, critics look down upon this film. It is truly brilliant.The key to this entire film is the way the filmmakers framed the entirety of the Chinese wartime saga through the eyes of a British boy. The film is broad in scope, with sweeping vistas and immense crowd scenes. But the heart of the film is concentrated, focused, into the character of Jamie Graham, outstandingly played by young Christian Bale.The writers really got into the head of this 12-year-old boy. This kid goes through so many changes, like all children do, and you're with him, every step of the way. They start him off as a spoiled brat, then suspend him in a state of shock as riots hit the streets of Shanghai. Then they put him on his own, where he makes safe yet foolish decisions. Then he becomes enamored with a less-than-savory role model. He moves through survivor to panderer and even has a touch of hormone-induced lust. Towards the end, he even investigates his own spirituality. All the while the effects of war rumble on around him.The best of all war movies focus on a few, or even one, characters. It's so easy to wash away all the soul of a film by focusing on large battle sequences or broad vistas. By capturing the soul of the people caught up in war, you capture the soul of the war itself. Spielberg does this so brilliantly here, he has made a terrific film.It's a shame others don't feel that way.10 out of 10. A perennial favorite.Barky",10,3,7,31 December 2005
American Hustle," American Ham
","American Hustle is a fine movie, I suppose. I'm not really sure, to be honest. The problem is it's such a hamfest of a movie, it's hard to focus to know for sure.This film has a lot going on beyond the characters and the story. It's set in the 70's, and such a horrendously clichéd version of the 70's it distracts you from those characters & story. You've got the red velvet leisure suits; the badly-fitting toupees; the ridiculously over-sized automobiles; the tight-curl perms; the bra-less, droopy dresses (OK, some distractions are worth it). Folks use 'ham' to describe over-the-top acting, but here we have undeniably 'hammy' use of sets, costumes, props, and locations. It's as if someone said 'find me everything 70's and dump it in this movie!'.The problem is they don't just use these clichés for setting and atmosphere (like 'The Ice Storm', for example), they just pile them up throughout the movie, right down to hackneyed scenes involving 70's-era mobsters late in the film. It's a cliché fest, and that distracts from the rest of the story. It's hard to take the main protagonist seriously under those ridiculous glasses.Then again, it is a fairly shallow plot, with a somewhat weak 'surprise ending', wrapping up the con inside a con inside a con. You've seen it all before, in movies of the 'con man' genre over the decades. I'm guessing the writers wanted to dump all the 70's clichés into one film and wrote tossed together a con-man script to tie them together; OR they had a fairly weak script and felt they needed to dress it up with 70's nostalgia to generate interest.The movie is OK. It has some funny moments. But it's not worth a full-price movie ticket, and is definitely not worth an Oscar nod.",7,0,3,28 December 2013
The Aviator," A great film, good for a wide variety of audiences
","The Aviator tells the story of aviation pioneer and eventual nutbag Howard Hughes. Leonardo di Caprio plays the title character, the wonderful Cate Blanchett plays the wonderful Kate Hepburn, Alec Baldwin plays the CEO of a competing airline, and Alan Alda plays a sleazy U.S. Senator.This is a very good film. I found it very entertaining, as did my 71 year old mother! This is the beauty of this film: it has plenty to appeal varying audiences. Are you riveted to E! Entertainment Television? You'll love Howard the Hollywood Playboy. Addicted to Discovery Channel? There are enough aerospace gewgaws here to satisfy any of you. Is the History Channel your thing? This is a beautifully-filmed period piece. Enjoy a weeper? The downfall of Howard into madness will set you off.Above all, if you love well-made, well-written, well-acted films, you'll like The Aviator.Don't be daunted by the fact it's a Martin Scorsese picture, it's not a violent picture. He has taken a turn from his standard fare and proved, at least to me, that he has great talent even outside his regular genre.9 out of 10. It didn't quite have the full emotional impact on me that I like films to have, so I just shaved off a point for that.Barky",9,0,3,8 January 2005
The Killing Fields," Powerful, Important Film
","I've finally seen The Killing Fields, more than 20 years after it was originally released.This is one of the most powerful, important films ever made. It is so important, now as ever, for everyone to understand what evil truly is. This movie shows evil in its worst form: the form of mass murder thinly disguised as ideological cleansing.What makes this film so special is not only the bare-faced method of its delivery (including some horrid shots of the dumping grounds of the murdered), but the way the film keeps a decidedly Southeast Asian feel. The filmmakers worked to keep that style, in the scenery, the music, the set design, and, most importantly, by keeping the Cambodian journalist front-and-center in most scenes. In fact, the only time the film doesn't work is when it focuses on the New York Times reporter (the main reason I give this film a 9 instead of a 10 are the pace-stealing scenes stateside). Far too often we only see such stories from our own viewpoint, it's incredibly refreshing (and bold) to film a story like this from the viewpoint of the foreign country whose ruin was precipitated by the careless policies of our own government.Wonderfully filmed, well acted, brilliantly scripted, The Killing Fields is a timeless, important classic. A must see for any student of history or film.9 out of 10 Barky",9,7,7,30 July 2006
The Italian Job," Great, fun, caper flick
","The Italian Job is a real blast to watch. It's a genuinely entertaining film, something you watch just for the sheer enjoyment of it. It's not heavy with drama or emotional hand-wringing, it has no cosmic statements about life, and it's not violent or profane. It's just a fun movie. Between watching the little Mini Coopers fly around the crowded streets of L.A. and the great bits by stereotypical computer geek-turned-crook (played gleefully by Seth Greene), I had a lot of fun watching this film.Special kudos to the background music. They truly set a masterful tone for such a movie, so subtle yet keeps you on the edge when needed. Apparently a lot of artists contributed to the music, I found it to be the classiest part of the film.8 out of 10. Not awe-inspiring but a great film to watch at the end of a lousy day at the office.Barky",8,88,128,29 June 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The best of the trilogy, sets a hard-to-beat standard
","The Fellowship of the Ring is the first episode of Peter Jackson's retelling of JRR Tolkien's trilogy Lord of the Rings. It tells the tale of Frodo Baggins, how he managed to come into possession of the Ring of Power, and the start of his quest to destroy it.After watching the entire trilogy, I feel I can now say this is the best of the three films. It set a very high standard of excellence the other two (for differing reasons) were not able to reach.As with all three films, the locations, set design, makeup, special effects, and all those elements are simply outstanding. The film is beautiful to behold, so stunning and rich it is entirely believable that Middle Earth truly existed at some point in time. The filmmakers are to be commended for making a true work of art.But beyond the visuals, this film excels because of an excellent, well-paced script. The film flows from one scene to another, one setting to another, one adventure to another. Even an often-criticized scene, the elven tree city of Lothlorien, acts as a respite for film audiences before the next phase of suspense and tension kicks in.The main characters (and their corresponding actors) are given their best moments in this film. In the later films Frodo, Aragorn, and Gandalf tend to get lost in all the action; but here they shine with their best moments. Gandalf is most entertaining in his Grey Wizard form; Aragorn is infinitely more interesting as the mysterious ranger and exile than as a would-be king; and Frodo is still a man with a choice to make, instead of a victim torn between a promise and the lure of the Ring. By the time the third movie rolls around all these characters are being swept up by the events around them, in this film they are making the choices that put them there.This makes Fellowship of the Ring the more enjoyable of the three by this commentator.10 out of 10.",10,0,1,1 June 2004
Armageddon," My #1 Most Despised Film of All Time
","I absolutely hate Armageddon with every fiber of my being. This is probably not the worst movie ever made, but when considering the budget, the number of big stars, and the shameless over-promotion it is dollar-for-dollar the most despicable.The action is way over the top, it is wholly unrealistic, the characters are not at all interesting, even the special effects can only be marked as sub-par (especially when considering the budget of this film). It's just one lame gag after another. 'Oh my God, I dropped a screw! The entire mission is doomed' over and over and over again until you find yourself wishing the mission would indeed end in a spectacular fireball just to put the film out of it's own misery!Unlike it's counterpart Deep Impact, these filmmakers don't even bother to showcase the human element of this story, how the potential end of the world effects society or even the characters involved. It's all about the father who feels like a failure; the girl who pines for her loser boyfriend; and the various psychotic episodes of the rest of the characters. Never do we even get the sense that these people care that the world is about to end. It's this lack of caring about humanity that boils out of the screen: the filmmakers didn't even like their audience. This isn't even a case of a good screenplay idea poorly executed (like Deep Impact), but the writers and filmmakers simply didn't bother to make a good film.This film will always sit at the top of my Most Hated List.",1,6,11,26 January 2004
The Village," Village of the Dumb
","I never thought, in all my years, I would see a film that stirred as much loathing as my #1 Most Hated Movie of all time: Armaggedon. Yet M. Night Shaymalan has done just that with the creation of this insulting twaddle of a film.Shaymalan, who brought us genius in 'The Sixth Sense', and suspense and tension in 'Signs', takes a shallow run at the concept of an 18th century haunted village (done so well in films such as Tim Burton's 'Sleepy Hollow'). Unlike Burton's film, however, Shaymalan's is boring, cliched, and unendearing, and that's only up until the big 'plot twist' towards the end. Then the film turns downright stupid and, yes, insulting to the audience.What separates 'Village' from other, routinely bad movies, is it is wrapped in fine cinematography, lighting, costumes, and other marks of a good film. Plus it was promoted to a certain caliber of audience, not your typical teen slasher flick. So it was supposed to be a 'quality, thought-provoking film'. Yet it is not, it borders on the ridiculous that would only be believable to those with the mind of an eight-year-old.Shaymalan must regard his audience with contempt to have created such a despicable piece of work. Well, turnabout is fair play. I will never see another one of his films again.I award this the coveted 1 out of 10 award for lame-arsed theatrical presentation of the year.",1,5,10,7 August 2004
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," The-Film-That-Should-Not-Have-Been-Made
","Since we first heard of WBs decision to break the last book of the HP series into two books, we've all been asking 'is this required to give full treatment to the Harry Potter universe wrap-up, or is it just a ploy to make the studios more money?' After seeing HP/DH Pt I, I have to say 'it's the latter'.I say this because it's a very weak movie.It is slow. It is ponderous. It is blandly written, blandly acted, muddily filmed, badly directed. It has no heart, no soul, it's just a collected series of vignettes and action sequences strung together by lots of wandering around. This is a phoned-in movie, you can see that the filmmakers have simply stopped caring but do it anyway because they know people will buy it. Or perhaps it's like a parent who has read the same book to their 4-year-old 87 times and has had just about enough of it, but still reads it again.Purists will probably like this film because it does contain more 'canon' than prior films. But this film ALSO explains why you can't film a book beat-for-beat, it ends up bland and lifeless. The screenwriter did not do a good film-to-book translation this time, it seems like he just shoved the manuscript into screenplay software and called it a day. All the various episodes and incidents are simply chained together without much to tie them in. There's very little emotional reason to move this story along from point to point, things just sort of move. This is a lot like JKRs writing itself, she always found some little hunk of trivia to shove the plot along rather than developing a story that grows organically. It should have been the screenwriters job to find the emotional cores of the story, focus on those, and craft a screenplay accordingly. But he didn't. This is like recipe cooking instead of culinary artistry.The primary actors (the three heroes) didn't help matters much. Either through choices of their own or through poor direction, they woodenly carry on, showing very little emotional range, even during the various argument scenes. And AGAIN they're playing broody, angsty teenagers. OK, OK, we've seen that in the last three movies. Can we move along now, please???? These actors are not pushing themselves and are not being pushed. Again, they're phoning it in, just like everyone else phoned it in. I hope they at least made barrels of cash for the effort.And where are the rest of this stellar cast? There is some enjoyable stuff from Brendan Gleeson and Imelda Staunton, and Helena Bonham Carter has a far-too-short, intensely creepy scene with Emma Watson, but the rest are absent or nearly so. Alan Rickman only has a cameo, and basically everyone else acts as nothing but window dressing. Even Bonnie Wright, playing Harry's love interest, is given nothing more than a single scene, where in the book she's constantly in his head. Part of the appeal of the HP movies is the richness given by the myriad of characters, but here they're just set pieces. I'm not even a fan of Ralph Fiennes work in this film, he was better in earlier ones. They should have cut back-and-forth between actions elsewhere in the world rather than making us watch the Three Amigos lost in the woods for hours on end.Then there's the cinematography. Somewhere down the line, someone said 'this is a dark film'. And that's how it's filmed: dark. Has a perpetual eclipse hit the Hogwarts world? Ugh, it's downright putrid to watch. Guys, 'dark' is a DESCRIPTION OF THE FEELING OF THE MOVIE, not a literal description of the visuals. You can have moods and tension and 'darkness' in broad, sunny daylight. filmmakers have done this all the time for decades. Watch the ending of 'Se7en', filmed on a bright, sunny day in California scrubland, yet is one of the creepiest, nastiest scenes ever captured on film. Dark doesn't mean drab.What I see in HP/DH Pt. 1 is a full retreat into complacency, pattern, style, and motif that these producers have used for the past two films. They have taken no risks, are making no statements, are doing nothing more than mass-producing HP movies for our consumption. They are phoning it in. The HP franchise has officially become stale and lifeless.Sadly, they'll make millions making it.",4,22,33,30 November 2010
"I, Robot"," Good sci-fi mystery
","The film 'I, Robot', tells the story of a cop (Will Smith) in the not-too-distant future. A top robotic scientist commits suicide, and Smith's character is called upon to investigate. Being anti-robot himself, he soon discovers all is not well with the peacefully-programmed androids.This is a very good sci-fi film. It has a lot of action, special effects, and even a small handful of social commentaries. The filmmakers have learned well from the experiences creating Gollum in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, using the same techniques to infuse the robots with fluidity, interest, and, in one important case, emotion.The film is excellently paced, and (surprise!) comes in at under two hours, a rarity in this era of overblown filmmaking (not every film needs to be an epic).Will Smith, as usual, excels in this type of role. He makes this film, and for the most part the director smartly focuses on him and his performance. Many leading male actors are way to full of themselves, turning their parts into endless ego trips. Although Smith does throw in a couple of cute catchphrases, by and large he excels yet is still human in this role.I give this a film 8 out of 10. There is one highly implausible, and therefore comical, car chase sequence; and there is a character of a teenager that really makes no sense and is more of a distraction than anything. Plus the denouement is well intentioned but in the end muddy.
Otherwise, it's a very good sci-fi film.",8,0,0,1 August 2004
The Alamo," Standard Disney Dramatic Fare
","The Alamo tells the oft-repeated story of the last stand of Texas soldiers, including some famous historical figures, in the face of overwhelming odds. This historical event has been the basis for jingoistic nationalism so many times in American history it's gone beyond cliche.Fortunately, Disney didn't go down the big flag-waving path with this film. They have attempted to weave a tale around the characters involved, characters with their own personal trials and flaws. We see Jim Bowie laid up with cholera and pneumonia. We see David (not Davy) Crockett trying to come to terms with his own fame. We see William Travis attempting to turn from pompous dandy to leader of a doomed garrison. We even see the minor characters in this tale: the Mexican soldiers who fought under the Texas flag; the slaves of Bowie and Travis; the young Mexican soldier who doesn't want to die; Santa Anna's officers who see his fallibility and ultimate cowardice.These were all noble efforts on the part of Disney. Problem is, they didn't quite pull it off. It's still too much of a Wonderful World of Disney production, with largely uninteresting dialogue and generally weak character development. The acting is pretty good, the production values are not stellar but decent, it's just the script that falls flat. Just when they start to get interesting with one of the characters, they cut away and never go back to what made it interesting.So I had mixed impressions. I'm glad they didn't go all Toby Keith on us, but they missed the mark on what they did do. 5 out of 10.",5,1,5,17 April 2004
Van Helsing," A little over the top. Actually, WAY over the top!
","Van Helsing tells a tale crudely based on the fictional vampire hunter. It blends several stories together: Dracula, Frankenstein, and the legends of the werewolf.I won't bother going in to the plot. This is not the kind of movie to see if you're interested in plot. This is also not the kind of movie to see if you're interested in characters. This is not the kind of movie to see if you're interested in using your brain at all.Having said that, it's a fun enough movie. Sure, it takes loads of liberties with famous fictional characters. Yeah, it doesn't tax the acting abilities of Hugh Jackman or Kate Beckinsale (although David Wenham is terrific as the mousy, brainy, and horny Friar Carl).But it is action packed, with lots of stunts and special effects and other early-teen fodder. The make-up and sets (whether CG or real) are very well done. And it's not vulgar, a plus for movies of this genre.A big problem I had with this film was the overuse of CGI effects, especially during the climactic battle scene. It was almost painful to watch. They could have taken a few lessons from Peter Jackson on how to incorporate CGI into a film. Too much is too unwatchable.A good enough movie for what it is. 6 out of 10.",6,0,0,9 May 2004
The Machinist," Creepy Psychodrama
","It is so difficult to craft a first-person narrative from the viewpoint of a psychotic. When someone does manage this feat, however, the results can be fantastic, easily trumping any other type of thriller.The Machinist is such a movie.First we have the protagonist, played remarkably by Christian Bale. The problem with first-person psychodramas of this type is keeping the audience's empathy with the creep. Yes, it will be revealed that the protagonist is actually less than savory, but the audience has to still relate to the character as if he was the protagonist. The writer and actor do this brilliantly with Trevor. You not only physically see his pain, but you find yourself caring about the guy and wondering 'what in the world happened that led him to this awful fate?' We care about Trevor, yet we know that somehow he has done something horrible.Then we have the plot line. Psychodramas can overdo the plot, by overdoing the creep factor or make the person see obvious hallucinations. If it's too telegraphed you've demeaned the film by making it another teen shocker. But you can't underdo it, either, making it so boring the audience loses interest. The filmmakers here have kept a great balance. You're trying to figure out what's happening, what's real vs. what's imaginary, trying to see how the pieces fit. It's this puzzlement, with enough answers yet still enough questions, that keeps an audience involved. Too many questions and audiences give up, too many answers and the audience doesn't respect you.Finally, and most importantly, you have the climax. So many good psychothrillers resolve themselves in outlandish ways, or in mundane, pathetic ways. The Machinist ends so aptly, in a way that you can both despise and pity Trevor. So the whole build-up isn't wasted on silliness, nor is it lost in a sea of gore and action. The Machinist strikes a perfect balance.A few other things work in this film's favor: -- Supporting cast is very strong. Jennifer Jason Leigh is very believable as a sympathetic hooker, and the cast of the machine shop are spot-on (I've worked in machine shops and they got those guys down pat!). -- Cinematography. All throughout the film the lighting is just subtly off, and I mean that in a good way. It keeps you just slightly off balance, adding to the protagonist's unstable state.-- Set design. It's filmed in Spain, but dressed up as America. While I was watching this movie, I felt the surroundings were also a little bit off. I wasn't entirely sure why, until I learned it was filmed in Spain but dressed as America. This doesn't come off as cheesy at all, however. It actually adds to the 'tweak' of visual psychosis. All the details are accurate, but the 'feel' is wrong. It was probably a happy accident that this happened, but it does add to the feeling that Trevor simply isn't seeing things correctly.Overall, this is a well done psychodrama. 9 out of 10. For a bit of time it repeats itself, but other than that it's quite excellent.Barky",9,8,13,23 December 2005
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," OK, but could have been outstanding.
","The film version of The Prisoner of Azkaban is not that bad. Acceptable, in fact. What upsets me is it could have been so much more.This is the first novel in JK Rowling's series that really delves in to who Harry Potter's parents are. It's the big mystery up to this point. Who were they? What was their life like, and why did they meet their end? These are the questions answered by this novel.Sadly, the movie does a terrible job answering these questions. There is so much rich dialogue between Harry and the adult characters in this book, yet the filmmakers have shortened it to such an extent the message is lost. There are such great scenes between Lupin, Sirius, Snape, Harry and other key characters in the novels that would have been stunning between these fine actors, but they don't get their chance. And those bits of dialogue that are included are not sold in their proper way, just not played as they should have been so their meaning is lost.The filmmakers did an outstanding job with the three young characters. Their respective actors are definitely improving, and they have been given some very good dialogue and good direction from Alfonso Cuaron. They are indeed the stars of the show.Not overly impressed with Gambon as the new Dumbledore. The stupid pajamas they had him wearing for the duration of the film took away his authority and power, the costume department did him a major injustice.The effects are excellent, but I'm not thrilled with the cinematography. The colors are washed out, it's very brown. I think that's part of the statement: the message of the film is darker. But they can have a dark film and still make it stunning as well. It's almost as if they stopped watering the grass at Hogwarts over the summer.Overall, I think the desire to go darker was wise, but they only did it in a visual sense. Dialogue-wise, they are still talking to children. They need to ramp it up in subsequent novels, and stop shooting for that PG rating.7 out of 10",7,0,0,6 June 2004
The Commitments," A Film with Lots of Irish Soul
","The Commitments is a film about a fictional band of the same name. An eclectic mix of musicians from the hardscrabble sections of Dublin, Ireland, The Commitments is a band looking for its own soul through the music of American classic artists like Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, James Brown, and Wilson Pickett (featured in a great non-cameo).I loved this movie. It has a lot of elements I really enjoy in films:-- a terrific ensemble cast, a mix of actors and actual musicians. -- set in Ireland, a favorite of mine. -- set in urban locales (namely Dublin and a barrage of dank and nasty pubs & alleys). -- interesting characters. -- a very funny script. -- realistic dialogue, right down to the gutter talk and innuendo. -- great music.Overall, it's a winner in my book. 9 out of 10.",9,1,4,1 June 2004
No Country for Old Men," Good Start, Bad Middle, And, Eventually, Naptime
","I loved Fargo. It's on my own, personal Top 10. So I was very interested in No Country.The film starts out really promising. Local hick (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon the bloody remnants of a drug turf war, and slinks away with a satchel of cash. Creepy hit man (Javier Bardem) hops on his trail. Long-in-the-tooth sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) tries to head them off before carnage ensues.For about the first half, the film has great promise. Some of the sneak, counter-sneak scenes between Brolin & Bardem (like the give-and-take around the cheap motel) are suspenseful and tense. The Coen brothers start to build intrigue upon intrigue within the drug gangs themselves, leading to some real promising encounters at the end of the film.Unfortunately, the Coens let this film fall apart. For some reason, they take the focus off the criminal suspense and on to Jones' Sad Sack character. All we end up hearing is his moaning about how 'it's so hard to be a sheriff these days'. They then let the interesting hit man plot die abruptly, suck all the energy out of the film, and it dies a quiet death. I actually fell asleep during the last ten minutes or so waking up during the closing credits.The Coens really lost their way on this one. It almost looks like they got bored with the film and wanted to wrap it up quickly or something. Why they drone on about retirement, I don't know.All in all, a poor attempt from otherwise capable filmmakers. 4 out of 10.",4,4,8,1 December 2007
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Jackson's a kid in a candy store -- and we get the diabetes
","Peter Jackson's 3-episode interpretation of The Hobbit is turning into a sticky, gooey mess. What a horrid series of films.This isn't about book purism or Tolkien loyalty or any of that. I understand the difference between writing and filmmaking, and why one can never translate directly into the other (especially when the latter occurs 75 years after the former). My contempt for the Desolation of Smaug concerns filmmaking itself: storytelling, dramatic tension, character development. Even the framing, action and stuntwork do not work in this film.The root of the problem is PJ does not have an internal filter. He dreams up ideas of increasing ridiculousness, and throws them on the screen whether the story benefits or not. He dreams up wonderful elvish combat maneuvers: they're in the film. He dreams up various orc prosthetics: they're in the film. He dreams up goofy, hammy character appearances: they're in the film. He dreams up immense set pieces and constructs unbelievable battles in the midst: they're in the film. But you can't do filmmaking that way! Good films, even good action films, need to be built on a solid core of character and story. In fairness, the Hobbit itself is not particularly meaty in those areas: it's a bit goofy, a bit sparse. It was a children's book, after all. But that's what a good screenplay needs to reinforce in such cases. It's what PJ and his writing team did in LOTR! They beefed up the story and added emotional context to the characters to make the audience care about what was happening. When Frodo was confronted by the Witchking in the Two Towers, you were afraid for the guy because the film, up to that point, made you care! In the Hobbit, however, they are not shoring up the character and story in this three-layer cake at all. Instead, they are slathering on such a heavy coating of empty frosting in the form of goofy action sequences, sticking on gumdrops of forced slapstick comedy, and pouring on a thin crust of chocolate sprinkles in the form of CGI (much of which is poorly done and pulls you out of the film). In the end, you have a cake that's inedible because of all the sugary crud slathered on top. All this 'stuff' totally overwhelms the cake in the center, completely obscuring the overall storyline, and smothering the characters of Gandalf, Bilbo, Thorin, and the rest of the poor dwarfs (who mumble along in complete obscurity for the duration of the film). Even Smaug gets short-shrift (he is a marvel of visual magnificence, but is also reduced to a slapstick fool before too long).What PJ does not have is a filter. You can tell he's gained so much power as a filmmaker that no one is challenging his decisions. He gets away with everything no matter how ridiculous, no matter how distracting, no matter how smothering. He has no sanity check, no capacity to self-edit. And the film suffers for it: it's so overdone in action and set pieces, you become bored with it. I was praying for the movie to be over by the end.When you engage in any creative endeavor, it's important you get all your ideas on the table, no matter how outlandish. But then you ALSO need to learn how to edit, how to scrape away everything that is not helping you tell your story or portray the vision. It can be a hard thing, giving up that great idea, but if it helps you reach your goal, you drop it by the wayside, and focus on what's important.PJ did not do that, and as a result, we have a sticky, gooey, sickly-sweet mess of a cake that will surely give us all diabetes.",1,237,455,16 December 2013
Batman Begins," Surprise, surprise! Big action films can have character, too!
","Thank you Christopher Nolan & David Goyer!! Thank you for proving that you can make a big-budget action picture that also has the elements of quality film-making, namely plot, character & writing.These filmmakers have managed to do what we all considered was impossible. It is possible to have character development amongst ninja fighting. It is possible to have great dialogue amongst high-tech gadgetry. It is possible to have solid acting performances amongst green-screen CGI. It is possible to have an interesting plot line amongst explosions and carnage.All the Jerry Bruckheimers and Roland Emmerichs of the world should take careful note of Batman Begins and learn how to do this genre right.Quite possibly the best comic book adaption ever seen on the big screen. 10 out of 10.Barky",10,1,1,26 June 2005
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Disappointing
","Going in to the Hobbit, I had certain expectations based on Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy.I expected the film would be beautifully shot, with fantastic art design, intricate sets, detailed costumes, and spectacular scenery. They did not disappoint. The continuity of the art department and cinematographer from those films to this one shows, and it also shows that they still care about what they are doing. I especially love what they did with the dwarven stronghold of Erebor. My only criticism in this area is the make-up on Thorin Oakenshield, especially the facial hair. He does not look like a dwarf. I know it's a starring role and the actor needs to emote through the makeup in order to 'sell' it. You couldn't have him buried in extensive hair/bear/mustache pieces (like John Rys-Davies suffered through in LOTR). But Thorin is just not a dwarf in this film. Kili also does not look like a dwarf, but at least he plays the character in an upbeat, youthful fashion so his '5 o'clock shadow' scruff seems appropriate. But Thorin is a dour character, and his look -- which I call 'dwarf metrosexual' -- just does not fit. The rest of The Company have great looks, I know they could have come up with something better for Thorin.I expected this movie to have a great film score. Howard Shore's work on the trilogy was outstanding, and made those films complete. Here, well, there are few new pieces, but most of the score is derivative from prior works. I know it's important for some continuity. The hobbits, in particular, are very set in their ways, so it's highly appropriate to use the same themes for Hobbiton that Shore used in the first trilogy. But they recycled the Ringwraith theme, even though they don't appear in this film, and they used a lot of the same segue music and other cues. There are a few new songs, cues, and themes, but even there, a few fall flat. I remember one specific choral piece simply not fitting with what was happening on the screen. Choral music is used to imbue pathos into a scene, but I don't recall that scene requiring pathos. I just remember the choral music not fitting the mood.I expected this movie to have a lot of action sequences. This is where Tolkien's 'The Hobbit' is actually above LOTR: it has a lot more action sequences. There's a lot here to excite: Smaug's attack on Erebor is brilliantly portrayed, the above-ground warg chases are pretty harrowing, as is the film's climax. But there's an awful lot of goofy crap in it, too. The underground battle with the goblins has some goofy chase sequences that reminded me of a version of Pitfall produced for the NES some 15 years ago. A friend turned to me and said 'obligatory video game sequence', so it wasn't just me. The Goblin King and his odd army are brilliant, but the escape scene is just goofy. There's also this encounter with stone giants in the mountains that, although faithful to the book, is so ridiculous it pulls you out of the film. Then there's the Radagast sequence, which is complete 'WTF?' I know 'The Hobbit' is a kid's book. I know it's not LOTR. I actually like that they had goofy dwarfs and a generally lighter tone than 'Lord of the Rings'. But some of these action sequences are just so utterly ridiculous they ruin the whole thing.Finally, I expected the story to be expanded. The writing team said as much throughout the production. I was hoping it would be a good, meaningful expansion (like the Arwen arc in the LOTR films). I was also hoping the expansion would bring depth to the other characters (JRR Tolkien's 'The Hobbit' could not be considered a 'character piece'). I found myself not pleased with the results. I found the additional story elements (specifically the White Council/Necromancer backstory) to be irrelevant and uninteresting and not thematically appropriate to the story. 'The Hobbit' is a lighthearted adventure, adding in this heavy plot stuff interrupts that flow. I also found the addition of Frodo and 'old' Bilbo in the beginning of the story to be unnecessary. Sure, it was cool to do a transition between Ian Holm's Bilbo and Martin Freeman's, but it could have been simpler and to-the-point instead of the exaggeration it became. I know the filmmaker wanted to include his friends from the first production in The Hobbit, and I am a fan, they are all fine actors, but he should have focused on the story at hand instead.What really bothers me about these additions is they take away time that could have been used to work on the various characters, specifically Thorin and the relationship between and amongst his fellow dwarfs. Adding a bit of interpersonal conflict between the dwarfs would have made it so much more interesting than just adding another storyline. As it is, they are (as yet) undeveloped. We know Thorin is grumpy and determined, we know his dwarfs are goofy and boisterous, we known Bilbo is a fish out of water. Beyond that, there's not much going on with them. Contrast 'Fellowship', with it's touching character-driven scenes such as Gandalf & Frodo's talk in Moria; Aragorn & Boromir's encounter in Rivendell; the hobbit bonding experience running from the Black Riders; and all the touching stuff at the end when the Fellowship breaks. These moments don't really exist in 'The Hobbit', and that's the biggest shame of this film.Bottom line: it's entertaining, it's beautiful to look at, but it's overboard on goofiness, camp, and PJ's favors to actors, and not deep enough on character. It's disappointing.",6,7,13,31 December 2012
Saving Private Ryan," Quite possibly the best WWII film ever
","Saving Private Ryan is quite possibly the best World War II-inspired movie ever.I know, it's not at all historically accurate. I know, there are plot points that don't make sense. I know and understand all these criticisms.As a film, however, and as a statement on what war is and how war affects people, this film is Top Notch and should have won the Best Picture Oscar the year it was released.This film has exciting, graphic, horrifying and realistic battle footage. The opening montage alone represents the best film-making possible regardless of technology.The cast is simply brilliant, not a lame or hackneyed performance in the bunch. Tom Hanks is again Oscar-worthy, and if they had an Oscar for Best Ensemble Cast this film would have won hands-down.This film is absolutely *nothing* like the cheesy WWII movies with John Wayne or Henry Fonda or Ernest Borgnine. This film is not all jingoistic patriotism, it is a real look at what real war is like, with heroic soldiers and cowardly soldiers and soldiers simply trying to do their jobs and survive. It shows the futility of war and the necessity of war. And it pulls no punches in showing the horrors of war.Beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, terrifically written, truly an amazing piece of film-making.10 out of 10 for an inspiring film.Barky",10,4,7,3 July 2005
Seabiscuit," Good entertainment, even with the schmaltz
","Seabiscuit is a tale not only of a champion horse once deemed unfit for racing, but of three people (owner, trainer, and jockey) who were once marked marked as failures in their own right. Fighting various adversities, and leaning upon one another, they come through and win in the end.It's a fine movie. It doesn't take any great leaps into the soul of humanity, it doesn't have any far-reaching ideas to propagate to the masses, it doesn't investigate the meaning of the universe. It is a simple story with simple messages of 'never giving up.' It's not especially challenging but it's good.I think the only thing I disliked about the film was the syrupy film score. We've all heard it before, the same musical cues to denote sadness or victory or suspense or joy. Sound tracks like this one have become cliches and IMHO worsen the film by taking away any sense of mystery of what happens next. 'Oooh, the strings are high, we're all supposed to tense up now.' Yawn.",8,0,1,6 February 2004
Lawrence of Arabia," Classic, Epic Fillmmaking
","I have finally sat down to watch the entirety of Lawrence of Arabia, David Lean's 1962 classic film.Watching this film, it is easy to see how today's epic films (from Braveheart to Lord of the Rings) owes so much to David Lean's brand of storytelling. This film is a lesson in how to make an epic film. He sets the standard and shows us how it's done.The cinematography in LoA is absolutely stunning. Shot setups are superb, and the beauty of the photography belies the fact that desert shootings represent some of the worst possible lighting conditions. And Lean really uses the scenery, the desert setting is really a character in the film. Shot choices in this film have been used in other desert films ever since, you cannot help but say 'Oh, they copied this shot for Hidalgo' as you watch this film.The action sequences are also superbly shot and exciting. Again, David Lean sets the standard for such sequences, and without all the high-tech gadgetry available today. The cavalry charge on Aqaba show real mastery on the part of the wranglers and stunt coordinators, as does the train attack. This action seems 'toned down' by today's standards, but is perfect for this film: it is exciting to watch but does not distract the viewer from the story or the key characters.For it's not all about the epic, it's really all about the characters (in this case, Peter O'Toole's T.E. Lawrence). Lean doesn't forget this film is about this character, and does a great job keeping that focus, and not getting lost in the vastness of the scenery. Clearly this is O'Toole's movie, he does a great job portraying the transformation from slightly arrogant but thought-provoking lieutenant to the fractured war hero known as Lawrence of Arabia. This is O'Toole's first major work, yet it seems he was built for the role. He does it brilliantly. Clearly he had something to prove, and prove it he did.I only have mild criticism for this film. First of all, Alec Guinness as Arab Prince Faisal was really bad casting. Sir Guinness is one of the greatest actors of all time, but I found his performance here distracting, not embellishing. It's not one of his better performances, he seems to try to hard to be Arab, but can't hold it together.I also found the musical cues out of place at certain times. Maurice Jarr's score is striking, and did set the tone for all desert pictures since, but not all the cues work well. Sometimes the music is overdone for no reason, and other scenes call for music where there is none. Film scores have advanced since that time, and credit should be given to a pioneer in the epic score, but it was still distracting at times.Otherwise, this is a top-notch film, and a must-see for fans of epic film-making.9 out of 10 Barky",9,4,8,29 August 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," Not too bad, but not quite right, either
","I went in to this movie with incredibly low expectations. www.aintitcoolnews.com was merciless with bad spin and reviews for this film, and I tend to believe them.Fortunately, it wasn't as horrible as they were saying. I found it entertaining. The storyline was interesting, the characters were kept interesting (albeit some had unfortunate early exits). The effects and stunts were fun.The big problem with this film was the polishing. Basically, it wasn't polished at all. And there's nothing like a good polish to make the silver shine. A few of the elements that could have used some fine tuning:-- The look of The Beast. A bit too silly for my taste. -- The character of The Phoenix. She had her menacing moments, but mostly she just 'hung out' and waiting for things to happen. It was like the writers couldn't figure out what to do with her. -- The stunts, especially Storm's flying. Clearly this was wire work, and clearly could have used some polish. Storm flies, she doesn't just hover or bounce around. -- Too many characters spoils the broth. There's simply too many mutants in this film, it's like a cook throwing in the entire spice rack because he doesn't really know how to cook.None of these things are fatal to the film, they are just things that kept it from being a great movie.It's a shame, really. The first two X-Men films were really top-notch, it's a shame the studios couldn't stay committed to make the third one top notch as well.Of course, it does have Ian McKellan. You can't go wrong with Ian McKellan.7 out of 10, for lack of polish.Barky",7,0,1,14 June 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Tough to put on film but came out very well
","Long before it came out, I knew The Two Towers would be the toughest of the three Lord of the Rings books to put on film. Not only is it the middle child, but the very structure of the book makes it hard to craft a linear story with all the plot lines in tact and interesting.But I think Peter Jackson and company did a very good job. It's not as strong as Fellowship, but is still outstanding.All the elements of the LOTR films are here: the beautiful photography, set designs, costumes, scenery, special effects. All amazing, all brilliant, all Oscar-worthy.The performances are terrific, too. Bernard Hill, Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Miranda Otto, all did great jobs. The supporting actors, too.It is sad that Ian McKellan's role is relegated to almost cameo status, but that's the nature of the book. The biggest shame is Christopher Lee. He has so little screen time in this film, I think he only says two or three lines on camera, the rest is 'brooding'. Such a waste, he is one of the great actors of our time, a real joy to watch (and a scene stealer to boot).But the stars of the piece have to be Gollum and Treebeard and the Uruk army. The sequence with the Ents seeing the destruction Saruman wrought upon the trees brought tears to my eyes, and their revenge brought cheers to my voice. The battle of Helm's Deep was probably too long, but impressive nonetheless (and will probably be the model for 'epic battle sequences' for years to come). And Gollum. What can be said about Gollum that hasn't already been said. We have entered into a new age of CGI, and, like all great works of art, it has a human soul.A great film. 9 out of 10, the only items keeping it from getting a 10 are the short-shrifting of Christopher Lee and that some parts don't quite flow too well (a problem rooted in JRR Tolkien's novel, not the fault of the filmmakers).",9,14,16,5 August 2004
Hero," Living Anime (If You're Into That Sort of Thing)
","'Hero' is a Chinese high-art film. It tells the story of a sword master (who is never named) who kills three assassins and goes to the king for his reward. But it is not quite so simple. There is intrigue here, exploring issues of trust and subterfuge.In essence, 'Hero' is really a comic book. Not your average 'Green Lantern', but from the anime genre of comic books, artistically done, beautifully drawn, intriguing in their own way. The film's characters are all symbolic avatars of emotion or thought or action, involved in fanciful fight sequences surrounded by a lush and beautiful landscape of scenery and set design. On set design alone 'Hero' deserves an Oscar nomination.The problem with 'Hero' is it serves a niche audience: those who favor such comics and anime features such as 'Gundin' and others. It is not a particularly strong film beyond that. The fight sequences are overdone and so unbelievable as to be boring. The characters are really one-dimensional, and the plot is quite transparent. As drama, it fails.But as this exclusive oriental art form, it succeeds.Well, except for the music. The music really blows. I'd like to be more descriptive but I think that sums it up pretty well.7 out of 10. I am not a fan of anime so I am being harsh. I think if you like that genre it deserves a 9 or 10.Barky",7,0,1,18 September 2004
Patton," All good war movies are about people
","I finally sat down and watched Patton end-to-end. And I have to say that, even after all these years and advances in film-making, it's still an excellent motion picture.Patton is one of those war movies that isn't really about the war, it's about the people in them. Bad war movies either aren't about the people at all, or use the characters as some stereotypical element lacking in any sort of realism or personality.Patton is different. It is a war movie about a man, one very ambitious, very egotistical, very talented man. A man so obsessed with combat he has forgotten how to be a human being, and is eventually forced to learn how to become one all over again.The film probably contains factual errors about General George S. Patton, but as a film it is an terrific character study about a man whose gifts are such a powerful, motivating force that all other characteristics are lost in their wake.10 out of 10. Stands the test of time.Barky",10,1,5,26 February 2005
Pi," Can you make a good thriller out of mathematics? You bet!
","What an amazing piece of film-making, all on a shoestring budget! And from such odd beginnings, too. The idea that you could make an exciting, tense, and thought-provoking film based around mathematical computations is absurd. But this is exactly what the filmmakers created with 'Pi'.Although the math clearly takes a focal point in the story, it's really just a vehicle for investigating what happens when a man gone mad. Paranoia, obsession, aggravation, grief, with tiny bits of joy (as shown by his interactions with a little girl): all parts of a man descending into insanity. So brilliantly crafted by the writer, so brilliantly portrayed by the actor, it's this descent that makes 'Pi' so fascinating.This is a film that uses symbolism to the Nth degree. This is the closest thing an American has ever gotten to an Ingmar Bergman film. You've got science, and religion, and philosophy, and the origins of universe, and the essence of thought, and the stuff of life. The film is just chock-full of suggestions on all of these things.In the end, we aren't entirely sure what happened to to the main character. Did he suffer a debilitating attack, thereby losing his genius? Or was he cured of his affliction, of which genius was only a symptom? In the end, there is a question on an old adage. If there is a fine line between genius and insanity, is the corollary that there is a wide split between genius and happiness? This film surely suggests that.Overall, a deep, thoughtful piece. Shot on a shoestring, so don't expect much in terms of film quality. But it's a fine work nonetheless.",9,0,1,24 February 2008
Children of Men," What a horribly dark future Alphonso Cuaron envisions!
","Children of Men is a post-apocalyptic vision of a world gone mad. The year 2027 finds all of the women on the planet made sterile. Entire countries collapse, and Britain becomes a shell-shocked land ravaged by racism, police brutality, and death squads.Enter reluctant hero Clive Owen (who's brilliant in pretty durn near everything he does, 'Children of Men' included). He is recruited by former lover Julianne Moore (slightly less believable as the rebel leader) to save the life of a 'fugie' (short for 'fugitive') who, miraculously, is pregnant. He needs to escort the young woman to meet up with the Human Project, a Amnesty International-like organization who rescues such people from the clutches of the government.This is a very dark movie. It's not directly violent, at least not to an extreme extent, but there are such subtexts, subtle and not, that are really reflecting a dark interpretation of our own world and the people who inhabit it (like all good speculative fiction stories should). We are shown a world where apathy and hatred are joined hand-in-hand, creating a world so terribly depressing it just oozes sadness from the screen. We are looking at a society without hope, and without hope, there is nothing but pain, torture, and death (handed out by the government in convenient carry cases of suicide pills).The film does have many exciting action scenes, including a terrific scene of an ambush. I won't spoil the scene, but Cuaron practically invents a new method of shooting an action scene from the viewpoint of the passengers in a car. It's quite spectacular, and worth the price of admission alone. There are some other great action scenes, filmed not head-on (as Spielberg would have done), but as sidebars (Cuaron focuses on the hero's drive to find the pregnant girl, and simply wraps those character-driven scenes amongst great battle sequences).The one and only reason I am giving this a 9 instead of a 10 is pacing in the early part of the film. I gauge a film's pacing by how often I look at my watch, and in the first half of this film I was so bored I took many glances (and even risked nodding off at one point). I think the director spent too much time developing the hero and his pot-smoking mentor (played cleverly by the great Michael Caine). The film could have used some tightening right there.Otherwise, this is a great film.9 out of 10 Barky",9,2,5,13 January 2007
Garden State," Pretty good tale of twenty-something angst
","Garden State is Part stoner flick, part love story, part family drama. The main character flies back to his New Jersey home to attend his mother's funeral. He reconnects with old friends, meets a new girl, and faces the demons haunting him in the form of his father.This is a good film, well acted and well written. The characters are compelling, the situations are funny when they're meant to be and sobering when they're not. There are some hysterical scenes involving illicit substance abuse at a house party; some tender scenes involving the new girl in his life; and some dramatic scenes with his father.The best part of this film is how they portray the psychopharmacology. The main character was put on lithium as a child (after he inadvertently caused a tragic accident), yet he leaves all of his meds in L.A. when he goes to New Jersey. The filmmakers do a great job portraying how this young man becomes more and more alert, to not only love but also to pain, as the drugs leave his system. In the end he is more capable of feeling anything than he ever was.9 out of 10. Could have been a little tighter here and there, but nothing major to quibble about.",9,0,1,22 August 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A Blast!
","A quintessential Tarantino campy slash-fest, full of gore and farcical violence but an absolute joy to watch! I love campy slasher flicks. I grew up on the Dawn of the Dead movies and a lot of kung fu stuff. The brilliance of Tarantino is he takes the best parts of all those off-the-wall films and puts them into superbly entertaining films. Kill Bill Vol. 1 is one of those.You've got guns shot through boxes of kids cereal. You've got unbelievable swordplay. You've got graceful choreography. You've got more profanity than you can shake a stick at. This film has all that stuff, and I loved practically every minute of it. And what a departure for Uma Thurman!! 9 out of 10.

Green Street Hooligans," Green Street Hooligans: A Must-See for Film School Students
","Green Street Hooligans is an independent film by German-born director Lexi Alexander. Starring Elijah Wood and Charlie Hunnam, it tells the story of an American's introduction to the violent culture of English football hooliganism.It's an interesting idea: GSH tries to portray a subculture that, to my knowledge, has never received a motion picture treatment. This alone makes it unique, a clever hook to tell a story about violence taking control of a man's thought process. This is usually Lesson One in any art form: finding a new story to tell.Unfortunately, this film has a lot of problems. There are problems with the script, problems with the acting, and problems with the photography. That's why I am giving it a poor rating. It's also for this reason I heartily recommend it for all film school students. All of the problems are completely salvageable, for the premise and foundation are sound. It just has some problems with execution that could be quite educational for aspiring filmmakers. A few of the lessons to learn:1)When casting against type, modify your script accordingly. Elijah Wood is a fine actor, but he doesn't quite sell the role of a football hooligan (even if the character is a fish-out-of-water). Frankly, he's too small. But the script writers could have compensated for this, by playing up not only his American ancestry and his lack of knowledge about football, but also his small stature. If that was *also* given to his character as an obstacle, the film would have been more interesting. As it is, they glide over that aspect of the character.2)Every troubled character needs a conscience. In every story, especially stories with violence, you need a 'Jiminy Cricket' character to represent the internal conflict to a troubled character. This adds the element of decision, of choice, and, therefore, of choices gone bad. Yet Wood's character, Matt Buckner, doesn't have any such character as counterbalance. The sister character doesn't really sell, she doesn't have the authority. And clearly Matt Buckner has contempt for the father character (which is nice, but not really effective as the conscience of the film). 3) Believable, exciting violence is difficult to film. It's taken years to get the technique down. Apparently, Lexi did experience hooliganism herself to some extent, but experiencing it and being able to convey it on screen are two different things. Some fight scenes work well (the brawl in the bar and outside the train station come to mind), but others (like Buckner's first fight in the alley) do not. It was probably a budget restriction, but a good fight choreographer could have done wonders. At the very least, research other films with great fight scenes before attempting to film one yourself.4) The climax needs a believable element of risk and danger. In the film, Matt Buckner's sister is endangered by a rival gang. Sadly, her reason to be there, and her entrance into the fracas, is horribly contrived and makes no sense. The audience can forgive a lot of plot holes if the film is good, but if the plot hole immediately proceeds the big finish, it takes away a lot of the film's momentum. 5) Don't underestimate the value of sex. If there's anything this film needed, it was at least a smattering of sex. These are adult men engaging in this world of violence, yet there are no women around! Highly unbelievable. I don't think hooligans are an abstinent bunch, it simply doesn't make sense. There is this one brief scene where Matt Buckner gets the phone number of some blonde, but he never hooks up. Are hooligans gay or something? It makes no sense, there should have been some women around, even one-night stands. A well-placed female lead could have provided the conscience needed in #2, or the risk needed in #3. 6) A character's journey needs to be shown, not simply implied. At the end of the film, Matt Buckner confronts a man who screwed him over in college. After perhaps a year of fighting and football-watching, he doesn't look very changed at all. Yes, Wood has a bit more of a scowl, but he just doesn't convey the tough-guy image. The director should have spotted this and made some adjustments, coaching the actor better. It was also a make-up problem: his face isn't even tanned (die-hard sports fans are quite tan in the face); and he doesn't have visible facial scars. His stance isn't even that tough. 7) Music is everything in film. There are some great soundtrack moments (gotta love the Stone Roses), but right at the end, after Buckner's confrontation, it really needed a 'hurrah' musical moment. Yet there isn't much of one. There is the chanting of 'bubbles', a pub song oft sung by the gang, but it really needed a bigger moment than that. It just doesn't sell. I don't think the film needed a big John Williams orchestration at that point, but 'bubbles' wasn't enough. I don't mean to be overly harsh of Lexi Alexander. She did give it a good try, and I hope she learned from the experience. And I do like the general concept. Perhaps, some time in the future, someone will make a better movie about this subculture. And hopefully Lexi will continue working in film, I sense that she does have a good story in her somewhere.6 out of 10, but still worth watching for the lessons it provides.Barky",6,1,3,21 October 2006
Blood Diamond," Decent enough movie, but could have used better editing
","Blood Diamond is my kind of movie. It has action, and stunts, and explosions, but they are really used to propel the storyline, not in and of itself. It also has an overriding ethical theme to it, in this case the tragedy that is war-torn Africa.It's a very compelling storyline. A simple fisherman from Sierra Leone tries to raise his family and educate his children. Yet the rebels have a different plan: they attack the village, slaughter many, drive the rest away, and capture the fisherman, making him a slave in a diamond mine. He discovers a large pink diamond, tries to smuggle it away, and the story begins.The story of modern-day Africa is not a simple one, and this plot is not a simple plot. They touch on the constant state of rebellion of some of these nations; they touch on the practice of turning boys into soldiers and killers; they touch on cross-tribal slaughter; and yes, they touch on the notion of blood diamonds.The acting is pretty good. Not fantastic, but decent. Leo DiCaprio does a fine job as Danny Archer, a mercenary diamond smuggler. This isn't an Oscar-worthy turn, sometimes his accent is cloying, and his final scene is a bit overdone, but his performance isn't too distracting and, in general, is pretty good. He's just a bit better in The Departed IMO.I liked Djimon Hounsou as the fisherman, Solomon Vendy. But he, too, overreaches at times. I think he suffers from writing or direction at times, you can tell he's being directed by a white American, his 'African-ness' doesn't really shine through. In other words, he's just a bit too unbelievable as a Sierra Leone peasant, but, like Leo, he does a good enough job with it.I wasn't totally thrilled with Jennifer Connelly in the role of reporter Maddy Brown. I'm not sure if it was her, or her character, that I had a problem with. It seems they just threw her in there because the film needed a conscience, and she solves some inconvenient plot holes, but overall, I don't think this particular character adds much to the film.That brings me to the overall flaw with this film, and the reason I give it an 8 instead of a 10. What the film really needed was editing and tightening. The addition of the Brown character, plus the expansion of the diamond cartel into an army of mercenaries, distract the viewer from the real meat and bones of the film. The best parts of this film are the unworkable relationship between Archer and Solomon; Solomon's quest for his family's safety (including his search for his soldier son); the overall chaos and brutality of a nation at war; and the sliminess of the blood diamond trade. Anything else (the reporter, some Dicaprio-Connelly sexual tension, the mercenaries), really distracted from those important elements and really should have been chopped, not on the cutting room floor, but in the script revision process.Filmmakers need to learn how to cut to the heart of the movie and tell that story, and leave the chaff by the wayside.8 out of 10, points taken off for some poor editing choices.Barky",8,4,5,22 December 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A clever, touching look at ending relationships. It's just not funny.
","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind looks not only at relationships themselves but at how important people in our lives affect everything that revolves around us.Jim Carrey plays a man who's girlfriend (Kate Winslett) has had him erased from her memory by Lacuna, Inc. (headed by Tom Wilikinson). In retribution, Carrey's character pays to have his memory erased of all knowledge of her.The film is played out through out-of-sequence scenes and bizarre imagery. This is a trend of many independent films (the recent 21 Grams is an example). I am not a large fan of bizarre filmmaking (I usually find it too pretentious), but here it is used pretty effectively to show the erasure of the lead character's memories of the ex-girlfriend.The big problem in this Jim Carrey movie: it's really not very funny, and his character isn't incredibly likeable. The journey the character goes through is indeed fascinating, but the character himself is humorless and bland. They should have injected him with a soul, then we could have cared more. There are some great moments with the Lacuna staff (the highly unethical trio of Mark Ruffalo [outstanding in this film], Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood). There are some quirky moments with the free-spirit only adequately played by Kate Winslett. And I do like the ending, both the poetic justice of the plot summation, and the question 'how do you recover a relationship when both parties know what you really think about each other.' But I'll only give it 7 out of 10.",7,0,1,28 March 2004

Like Star Wars, and The Abyss, and Jurassic Park, and The Matrix, this is the next generation of special effects and science fiction.I have to be honest: it is a wonderful cinematic experience. The visuals are spectacular, the animation is nearly flawless. This is a movie almost entirely composed of CGI animation. This is indeed a great leap forward in technology, and (being a big fan of animation), I was in awe of the technical achievement. By itself, it's almost enough to carry the film.I say 'almost' because, unfortunately, the film lacks so many fundamentals that have been around since the time of William Shakespeare, fundamentals that, if applied, could have made Avatar a masterpiece instead of a pre-teen Disney flick with stunning visuals.I'm talking primarily about plot, story, and connection. This is a weak plot, told so many times before you can guess every beat before it happens. You've got a primitive, happy, nature-connected tribe; you've got evil corporations intent on despoilment for profit; you've got their military dogs led by a grizzled Marine vet with anger management issues; you've got scientist-pacifists as their unknown collaborators. Then there's the epic, underdog struggle against a stronger foe solved by a singular plot twist and/or deus ex machina; and the happy tearful ending.I think what happened is James Cameron had this big CGI vision for this film, but he couldn't invest time or effort on a unique story. Perhaps this is just the way it had to be to make this great technical leap: grab together a simple story told a hundred times before, and use all your effort and energy in design and animation. Perhaps, in the future, we'll see an Oscar-worthy original screenplay told in a CGI universe. Avatar certainly isn't it.I will spike out the soundtrack specifically in this review. It is AWFUL!! You know what this soundtrack is? It's a conglomeration of music used in Lion King, Pocahantas, and other Disney films. There isn't anything interesting or unique about it, and that's a terrible tragedy. Here we have a new visual experience, and to not couple it with an original, creative, special soundtrack is a damned shame.I'm still giving it an 8, because it is so stunning it's enjoyable. And I always 'mark up' according to level of difficulty.",8,2,4,9 January 2010
Invictus," Sadly disappointing
","I'm very sorry to say it, especially because this film was created by talented folks such as Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood, but 'Invictus' is terribly disappointing.Nelson Mandela is a tremendously important figure in 20th Century history. His inspiring story affects not just South Africans but all of us. He deserves a film of the same emotional caliber as 'Ghandi' was for Mahatma and 'Kundun' was for the Dalai Lama. But 'Invictus' falls flat and fails to live up to that standard. This is an incredible shame, too, for if IMDb Trivia is to be believed, Mandela himself believed that the world cup rugby story sums up his history, charisma, and leadership quite nicely and would make for a good film.There are multiple problems with this film. First and foremost is the pacing. This movie is so dull, so lifeless, it clumsily plods along from one meeting to another with barely an emotional center at all. The script and the direction are the culprits here: too much idle chit chat. The biggest problem is the focus on the security detail. Fully 1/3 of the film is devoted to these chaps for no reason! There's little payoff for all that time investment. They should have been relegated to the sidelines, providing their one redeeming quality in this film: much-needed comic relief.Next is Matt Damon. Now I am far from a Matt Damon basher, I think he's a fine actor and never find him to be an ego distraction like so many other stars. But he adds very little to this story, his character could also have been sidelined. It seems like the producers wanted star power to get this project off the ground so they fished around for a big-name white star to give the film some cred and hopefully an audience. Then there's rugby itself. This has to be one of the worst sports movies ever made in terms of not engendering interest in the sport itself. I think 'MIghty Ducks' did more to promote hockey than 'Invictus' did to promote rugby. A sports movie should engage and excite the viewer. This one simply showed the stereotype that rugby is a brutal, pointless sport. I doubt there will be many kids lining up to learn rugby as a result of this film.Most aggravating is something the film LACKS. One of the most inspiring things to ever come out of Africa is the music. Where are the great African rhythms? This soundtrack, and the use of music throughout the film, is terrible. There's even this full-blown American pop number in the middle of it. None of the great, traditional, powerful, inspirational African music is in this film at all, and that really bothers me.This is a crying shame. Nelson Mandela's story needs to be told. 'Invictus' fails to tell it well.",5,11,22,3 January 2010
Reservoir Dogs," A truly excellent film of this genre!
","What a great movie.Yeah, it's horribly violent and profane, with lots of gore.But this really is a character study of a certain class of criminals.This represents not only the best of what independent films can be, but also how you can get tremendous bang for very little buck if you have a good script and good actors.Notice this film has very sparse sets, no chase sequences, very few stunts, and no special effects. Yeah, there's one dog but beyond that there are no tricks at all. Just great dialog well delivered.This is a classic. Quentin Tarantino at his near-best (in my opinion he parlayed this into Pulp Fiction, his best work).It's a shame that Tarantino hasn't been more prolific. But his handful of films truly revolutionized the whole indie genre.10 out of 10.Barky",10,2,5,9 November 2005
How to Train Your Dragon," Fun, fun movie
","What a great film. I had a lot of fun watching this movie, and the kids in the audience had a lot of fun as well.The film is endearing, with great dialogue and fun and moving moments. Lots of jokes, both for the kids and for the adults, and lots of action and excitement. Overall, a 'must have' in any parents' DVD collections.The only flaw with this film, the only reason I'm giving this a 9 instead of a 10, is the inconsistency in design. The main dragon character ('Toothless') is so wonderfully drawn, so sleek and mysterious, so emotive and beautiful, but most of the other dragons are goofy, pudgy, misshapen, and ludicrous. I guess it's in-line with the original kid's book on which it's based, but I found it distracting. If all the dragons were as beautifully and carefully designed as Toothless, the look of the film would be infinitely better.9 out of 10.",9,0,0,15 November 2010
Inside Man," A Keep-em-Guessing Thriller that Actually Works!
","Hoo boy, I really liked this movie! Witty, intelligent, well-acted, well-written, cleverly planned, what a great film. The writers did a brilliant job, and Spike Lee did a brilliant job bringing their idea to the screen.This is so much more than just an elaborate, twisty-turny crime drama. There is so much to like here, from terrific dialog to spots of terror to political intrigue.For several years now Spike Lee has evolved from a 'ghetto filmmaker' to a true icon of film. This film, along with '25th Hour' a few years back, prove that he has the ability to reach across all lines of society and make something with mass appeal. I was in a theater with a large cross-sampling of ethnicities and ages, and EVERYONE loved this film. One minute the theater is laughing with the lines, the next everyone's holding their breath, wondering what happens next.This is also Denzel Washington at his finest. His delivery is impeccable here.My only beefs are with the film score (the opening music was brilliant, but occasionally the music didn't set the right mood for the scene), and the somewhat miscast Jodie Foster (whom I love in virtually everything else she's ever done). She played her role admirably, but I don't think she was the proper person for that part.I have to give it 10 out of 10. I thought it was brilliant.Barky",10,2,4,1 April 2006
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," An Absolute Double-Barrelled Blast!
","Gads what a great flick! This is a twisty, turny, shoot-em-up and laugh at the outcome type of flick. Brilliant in its pacing, plot, scripting and delivery. THIS is how comedies should be made.It has a plot that's so complex it's hard to explain, but they pull it off brilliantly. All comedies have a screwball plot, but not all of them can pull it off. Sometimes you're so fixated on the fact that 'this film makes no sense' that you can't revel in the humor. With 'Lock, Stock' that is NOT a problem at all. You can go with the flow, and can be amazed as all these diversely bizarre threads come together at the end.The movie also dives into that great comic well -- known as Lower Class Britain -- and delivers everything it can possible promise. Copious profanity. Indecipherable (for us Americans) Cockney slang. Seedy locales. Multicultularism that blends in famously. And stuff that only is funny out of a Brit's mouth (if an American delivered these lines it would be horrible).The timing and pacing of this movie are spot-on. Only very rarely are there bits that 'hang', most of it is just one spot after another, bang bang bang bang. These folks really have comic timing down to an art form.Love the over-the-top hints of violence, too. In true Brit fashion they don't throw violence on the screen like Tarantino might. It's all there, though, and in great form. The ludicrousness of it is suggested, both in off-screen sounds and in the hilariously gruesome aftermath. Utterly brilliant in delivery! The filmmakers clearly had a plan and executed it to perfection. 10 out of 10, one of the funnest films I've seen in a while. Sure it's almost 8 years old, but it's worth renting it even now.Barky",10,6,9,14 December 2005
The Da Vinci Code," Anacrostic: The Movie
","Have you ever sat and watched someone else do a crossword puzzle? Not particularly interesting, is it. Sure, maybe there's that one tricky word that causes a bit of consternation, but beyond that, it's quite dull.Such is the film version of The Da Vinci Code.This film is such a non-event, a total waste of the talents of Ron Howard, Tom Hanks, Alfred Molina, and Ian McKellan. You're effectively watching others meander through a puzzle, without any sense of drama or human interest or anything to keep you involved. The worst part is you're not even shown the clues! You just trudge along, being told what's happening. It's like listening to color commentary at a Scrabble tournament.Character development is non-existent. Hanks' character is dull and lifeless, as is his partner (the sultry Audrey Tautou). Jeopardy is non-existent, frankly who cares if the Catholic Church is turned on its side (that's happened so much in recent years it's old news). The antagonists are not particularly threatening and only mildly creepy (and their eventual dispatch is, again, a non-event). The only interesting character is McKellan's Teabing, who provides the only levity and humanity in the film.There are a few interesting visuals involving flashbacks to events in the distance past. There is also one real shocking sequence that made me swear out loud (it is that good). Beyond that, this film doesn't have many redeeming features.5 out of 10, and I'm being generous.Barky",5,2,6,19 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Great Effects, Poorly Crafted Film
","I am quite disappointed with 'Goblet of Fire'. The key problem: this film can't decide what to be.Is it an action-oriented, effects laden moneymaker? Is it a coming-of-age story? Is it a kiddie flick? Is it a comedy? Is it a mystery? Is it a thriller? I don't know, and I doubt the filmmakers did, either.I empathize with them. GOF is a very large book, there are a lot of subplots and 'things' going on. But, sadly, they weren't up to the task.Sure, there are some great effects sequences, and the young actors' acting has improved over prior films, but the filmmakers lost the focus of the story by an inability to dictate the genre.Example: there is a mystery in the beginning when the premiere wizard sporting event is disrupted by terrorism. That incident is then ignored for some time, whilst the school hosts a sporting tournament of its own. Then we're told (not shown, but told, a key error in film-making) that someone is trying to kill Harry. But then that is put on hold while we watch teenagers fumble over dating (which is very well done, I'll grant). Then suddenly Harry is in danger again, and then the big spooky pre-climax climax, then a wrap up to the earlier mystery that we've all forgotten about.Prisoner of Azkaban was a much better film. It's a shame Alfonso Cuaron couldn't work this one, too.7 out of 10. Some great battle/special effects sequences and the 'teen angst' stuff was fun. But the pacing and scripting issues can't hold it together.Barky",7,0,0,9 December 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," Almost completely pointless
","Like most sequels, this film is more shallow than the original.I do not understand the attraction of this film series. Lots of cryptic gibberish nestled amongst fight and stunt sequences. Yeah, whatever.Look, I like good stunts and special effects as much as the next guy. But for me, there has to be a point to it all. There has to be a reason, something dictated by the plot, for all the chases and explosions. Otherwise you may as watch Saturday morning cartoons.This film makes no sense plot-wise. Lots of characters coming and going, lots of battles with purposeless bad guys.Not impressed. 2 out of 10.Barky",2,2,4,4 November 2005
Enemy at the Gates," An Underrated, Excellent Film
","This movie did not get the credit it deserved when it was first released. It should get it's credit now with the DVD. I heartily recommend it to any fan of war movies.It is a rarity amongst World War II movies ... a story told from the Soviet point of view. The Soviets suffered heavily during the war, both from casualties in the face of the Nazi juggernaut and from the stupidity and cruelty of their own leadership. Yet there was great heroism and bravery on the Eastern Front, as there were on the Western, told in perhaps hundreds of films.'Enemy at the Gates' tells the tale of one Soviet hero, the sniper Vassili Zeitsev. It's an excellent film. It has epic battle sequences, including a terrible flight across the River Volga. It has tension and suspense well fitting the stalking mentality of the sniper. Best of all it has an emotional core surrounding an unlikely hero and the woman who earns his respect.I only gave this film 8 out of 10. Although they did a good job, the main actors Jude Law and Rachel Weisz really didn't play their parts as Russians. Joseph Fiennes and Bob Hoskins (who is superb as Nikita Kruschev) did just that, and Ed Harris played Major Konig as the perfect noble German. But Jude and Rachel didn't quite hit that mark, although other parts of their performances were quite good.Even with those flaws, this is still a very good telling of the Siege of Stalingrad, with sadness and tension and action and emotion. It's earned a place in my collection.Barky",8,1,3,15 May 2005
The Departed," Scorsese Needs His Oscar ... and This is Worthy
","'The Departed' -- what an awesome *expletive* movie! Yeah, it's another of those cop vs. bad guy vs. cop movies, but this is probably the best interpretation of that style of film-making that has come out in years, perhaps even decades. It's gritty, and vulgar, and violent, and yes, a bit overacted. But it's fraggin' entertaining, I tell you what! This film has so many great elements. First, and most importantly, it's a great movie to watch. It's very rare for a movie to be entertaining through-and-through, 'The Departed' pulls it off. Most movies make me look at my watch several times, as if saying 'um, are they getting near the end?' Not 'The Departed'! Most of the actors play their characters slightly over-the-top. Matt Damon's vulgar turncoat cop is excruciatingly squeaky-clean. Alec Baldwin's vulgar police captain is excruciatingly by-the-book. Martin Sheen's vulgar police lieutenant is excruciatingly trusting, loyal, and competent. Mark Wahlberg's vulgar sergeant is excruciatingly tough, combative, and vulgar (yeah, I used 'vulgar' twice, and for good reason). And Jack, what can one say about Jack? His portrayal as crime lord Frank Costello is both over-the-top and subtle, for he really sells the idea of a powerful crime boss realizing his empire is falling apart.Now normally one would see these exaggerated characters as a negative in films, but in this case it works brilliantly. The film's core is Leonardo DiCaprio's conflicted undercover cop, Billy Costigan. He plays this very straight, and does a great job. What we are seeing is the world through Costigan's eyes, a regular guy's view of the ridiculousness of office politics in crime and law enforcement. When you're an undercover cop, the straight-laced police hierarchy (Baldwin and Sheen) seems comic. When you've overcome a tough childhood, phony toughness (Wahlberg) seems ridiculous. When you've struggled to make it in life, those who've had it easy but act otherwise (Damon) appear pathetic. When you're an honest guy thrown into a world of crime, the paranoia and wrath (Nicholson) seems otherworldly. By having these supporting actors put that bit of 'top spin' on their characters, it gives us the viewpoint of the main character.This movie (as also suggested) is quite vulgar. Expletives tossed out at every turn, the petty (and not so petty) bickering and demeaning that fills up this world. This movie is *highly* quotable (something not said about too many movies today). Some of the lines are hysterical! Of course, this is Martin Scorsese, so the film is quite violent. But these comical interchanges between bitter rivals keeps it light, you're not drowning in a sea of blood but are peppered with comedy amongst the carnage.The writing, of course, is really top-notch. This is a clear case where the writing makes the movie. The writers did a great job keeping the plot complex and surprising, yet intimate. The banter between characters is superb. The plot itself is not wholly original, so you may think 'I've seen this before.' I suggest you pay attention to how the pieces are put together: this is more of a character study than an action film, although there's plenty of the latter. And they did a beautiful job making an ending unlike most films of this genre. You do want to watch it all the way through. I don't know what the qualifications are for an Original Screenplay Oscar, if this fits the rules then these guys should surely be nominated.The soundtrack is also terrific. I don't know who's doing that Irish-ska-punk sound heard at various points, but I'd love get one of their CDs.I would love to see Martin Scorsese get his Oscar. I'm not entirely sure if the Academy will give it to him for 'The Departed'. Personally, I think it's a great movie, well-crafted, and Oscar-worthy, but I could see how the voters may be put off by the violence, vulgarity, and over-the-top acting by the various leads.However, if the rest of this season is like the season that has already passed, full of uninteresting crapola, 'The Departed' should be a shoo-in for at least a nomination.10 out of 10, a ranking I haven't used for many movies in 2006.Barky",10,3,6,21 October 2006
War of the Worlds," Clearly Not a Feel-Good Action Movie
","I left the theater with a real bad taste in my mouth after seeing War of the Worlds. Not so much because of the suggestions of gore towards the end of the film, but because the film impresses upon you a real sense of futility.Unlike other disaster films, this film has no positive emotional thread to carry you through the tension and horror. The main character, played by Tom Cruise, is such an incredible loser in life and does virtually nothing heroic or redeeming (except tossing one grenade). He, and his dysfunctional family, are basically tossed about by events instead of influencing them.Without either a positive emotional core, or characters that actually make a difference to the plot, this film ends up being an exercise in how to destroy others with great efficiency. And the ending, although faithful to H.G. Wells' original novel, doesn't play to a contemporary audience. Instead of redemption from divine design (Wells' original intent), the ending suggests that man doesn't really matter. And based on the uninteresting, lackluster characters, that suits mankind just fine.5 out of 10. An action/disaster movie without an emotional core falls pessimistically flat.Barky",5,0,2,3 July 2005
There Will Be Blood," Garbage. Vile, Sadistic Garbage.
","I didn't think it was possible. I didn't think it was in the least bit possible to make a film that I would forever despise more than that film dreck known as 'Armageddon'. But somehow, Hollywood manage to produce a filth of a movie called 'There Will Be Blood.' My title says it all: I consider 'Blood' to be vile, sadistic garbage.I can find practically no redeeming qualities about this film at all. The plot, centering around a success-driven early-20th century oil man (Daniel Day-Lewis), is only vaguely interesting. The first half is just a series of the same, tired 'independent businessman tries to make deals' storyline that we've not only seen dozens of times, but is patently boring. I nearly fell asleep during most of it. Then it turns into 'independent businessman becomes malicious psychopath' that is so utterly repulsive, I just wanted the ruddy thing to end. I don't think I've looked at my watch more times during any film, ever, just praying for the closing credits! The only thing that kept me seated in the theater was inertia  The pacing is terrible. This is a film that could use a good 45-minute edit. There's no need to have this movie two and a half hours long, it says all it can possibly say (which isn't very much) in a lot less than that. But it just gurgles along like oil seeping out of the ground: slimy, filthy, and repulsive.The characters were practically devoid of any interest whatsoever. I can't remember any that had any redeeming qualities. Day-Lewis' character was vaguely pitiable for a while, but then becomes just a sordid pile of hate and intensely unlikable. The son is mildly interesting, more so after a tragedy takes his hearing, but then is cast aside and so mishandled by the writers he almost becomes a write-off. Then there's a preacher, such an insane caricature (even by anti-religious Hollywood standards) he's instantly unbelievable and just ridiculous. I found nothing 'fascinating' about any of these people, nor of the actors who portrayed them.This isn't a case of 'I can't tolerate evil characters'. I just can't tolerate evil characters who are simply caricatures of evil characters! They aren't Gordon Gecko or Alex from 'Clockwork Orange' or the cast of 'Pulp Fiction'. These are one-trick characters, whose only trick is repulsiveness, something they (admittedly and unashamedly) excel at.And the music! I don't think I've heard a ghastlier soundtrack on a major motion picture in my entire life. Whomever did the score doesn't understand anything about cues or setting mood or anything that goes into making a good film score. It's a cacophony of ill-timed, poorly mixed, angry themes. This score suits this film like iron nails on a chalkboard suits a memorial service.About the only redeeming feature of this film are the period set design and costume pieces. There's also a terrific sequence involving an oil derrick fire. It does give the sense of the time period. But this is such a small part of the film, it's not enough to redeem it.Looking back on this entire, miserable experience that is 'There Will Be Blood', I can only say, with all seriousness, that everyone associated with this terrible motion picture, including those who rave about how terrific it is, needs to take a serious look at their own lives. If anyone I knew actually said 'this is a good movie', I would instantly recommend counseling for what must obviously be severe depression. I could not even fathom reducing myself to a state so wretched that 'There Will Be Blood' would be considered, by me, to be a creative endeavor! This film is a cry for serious, serious help.I think the members of the Academy have gone completely nutters if they consider any part of 'There Will Be Blood' is even vaguely worthy of an Oscar nomination. I consider it pure garbage.",1,15,32,15 February 2008
The Last King of Scotland," Well done study of a charismatic nutjob
","'The Last King of Scotland' is an interesting film. It tells the story of tyrant and murderer Idi Amin, as told through the eyes of a fictional Scottish doctor.It's pretty fascinating, how Amin's charisma kept the world guessing, at least during the early parts of his tenure. Forest Whitaker does an outstanding job portraying the nutbag, egocentric tyrant. But, in typical Hollywood storytelling, he's just a side character.The real story concerns the moral dilemmas faced by the fictional Scottish doctor, Nicholas Garrison, who befriends Amin and ends up in the bear cage. James McAvoy does a great job playing this character, he's a very fine actor, but I have to admit, the contrived storyline ends up being a negative for the film. I wound up investing a lot of time and compassion for this naive and torn character, yet later I found out he was an entirely fictional creation, and it was really a let-down.It's one thing to invent a character to ease in the telling of a story, this is done all the time. But to invent the lead role, and make the primary role of interest the secondary role, just cheats the audience immensely.Personally, I think they invented a white character to make the film marketable. The filmmakers should have learned from the excellent Hotel Rwanda, such a thing is not necessary. But, alas, the producers are still stuck in the stone age ...Fine performances all around, including not only Whitaker and McAvoy, but the cadre of supporting *black* actors who give tremendous performances in everything from Ministers of Health to neglected wives to lounge singers really makes this film great.8 out of 10, two points taken off for the contrived plot line.Barky",8,3,7,25 October 2006
Con Air," Awful. Utterly awful.
","What an awful movie. Everything in this movie that makes it vaguely interesting has been done in dozens of movies and with far better results. There is practically nothing original in Con Air. This is a Schwarzenegger/Stallone wannabe. There are far better one-liners in 'Total Recall' and far better action scenes in 'First Blood' than in this knock-off. This is a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy: washed out, unnecessary, and says the same stuff as all the action films that preceded it. Plus it's just badly made. Nicholas Cage is not only a fish-out-of-water here, he's at his hammiest worst. The action scenes & stunts are just goofy. The jokes have been done over and over again. It's just lame.The only redeeming quality is Steve Buscemi, but even there, he's been in a LOT of better roles. Watch 'Fargo' or something.A terrible movie. Shame on you, Hollywood!",1,16,38,31 December 2012
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," This Just In: Another SNL Alum Flops
","Anchorman is a comedy starring Will Farrell of Saturday Night Live fame. It is a spoof of 70's local news broadcasting, complete with sexist humor and wide lapels.It's a mediocre comedy at best. There are some very funny bits about lame local news stories (including the obligatory waterskiing squirrel), and a lot of sexist jokes about the new anchorwoman (played by personal favorite Christina Applegate). The scenes where the threatened reporters try to distract her during her first telecast are hysterical.The big problem is the film is not consistently funny. They ruin it right away by making Will and Christina an unbelievable 'item', it goes downhill from there. A promising but eventually ludicrous scene involving a rumble between rival telecasters shows one of the problems: over-the-top humor. Humor can be at it's funniest when it's smart and sly, here they try to pummel you with it, but unlike Airplane, they carry it too far.I give the film 5 out of 10, because it's funny about half the time.

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Meh ... :shrugs shoulders:
","At last it arrives ... the film linking the glory of the original Star Wars saga with the mediocrity of the new series.I am relieved it is finally over. It has been too painful to watch, but I felt I needed to get to the end.I suppose this isn't that bad of a film. I was 12 years old when the original Star Wars was released, perhaps today's twelve-year-olds will look upon this with the fondness I have of the tale of Luke, Leia, Han, and the Big Walking Carpet. I suspect they will, because in the nearly thirty years since the original release, this film series hasn't matured, hasn't grown, hasn't met the contemporary standards of quality film-making.Movies themselves have changed since 1977. Good filmmakers have built upon the ground-breaking work of filmmakers that have come before them. Spielberg built upon Kurosawa. Tarentino built upon Scorsese. Ridley Scott built upon John Ford. Everyone learns from those who came before, and therefore make better films.Not George Lucas.George Lucas has only looked upon himself. He wrapped himself in a world of his own creation, a world of profits, merchandising, and lavish praises from those seeking to capitalize on his earlier success. Yes, he made great advances in the field of special effects, but has lost all the soul, all the passion, all the emotion of good storytelling. He has not learned from those directors past, and is not paying attention to those great directors of today. If, for example, Lucas studied Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy, he would have learned how to infuse a majestic, awe-inspiring, effects-laden magnum opus with heart, and love, and loss, and pain, and success, and failure. But Lucas did not, and therefore Star Wars languished in several reels of mediocrity.Visually, this film is too busy. Too much going on, too many effects, too much action, too much noise blocking the focus on the heart of the story. The performances are too wooden and so poorly filmed the tension and doubt are washed out. The story is so convoluted and contrived it's hard to see the political allegory that should be intended.Such a waste. Such a waste of icons of popular culture. It could have been so much more in the hands of a talented director.I give this film 7 out of 10, really out of the kindness of my heart more than on the merits. I grew up on the original series of films, even tolerating the Ewoks because of the message of redemption in Return of the Jedi. Sadly this film has no redemption, but I lend it some anyway.Barky",7,1,1,26 May 2005
Ray," Fine toe-tapping tribute to a musical genius
","'Ray' tells the story of musical genius Ray Charles. Son of a single sharecropper mom, he started out dirt-poor in Northern Florida and became a national (er, international) icon. Along the way he transformed music by mixing jazz, gospel, blues, pop, country, and soul. He almost single-handedly tore down the walls separating genres and taught everyone how to mix it up.I really enjoyed this film. It is far superior to other films about musicians. The music itself does not stop, highlights of his career arc wonderfully throughout the tale, acting not as a musical backdrop but as a storyteller, a Greek chorus of sorts. Every song is put in context, telling us another part of Ray's life. Music was Ray Charles' life, and music puts the life in 'Ray'.Jamie Foxx was surprisingly good in this film. In the earliest scene involving Foxx he cracks a joke to a bus driver. For a moment you see the real Jamie Foxx, comedian and performer from 'In Living Colour'. But that is the last time you see Jamie, for the rest of the piece you only see Ray. This is a great tribute to the actor's talent.The supporting cast is terrific as well, again so good you don't even notice it. You only see the people in Ray's life (for good or evil). There has been talk of Jamie Foxx getting an Oscar nod for his performance, I think Sharon Warren, who plays his mother Aretha, deserves at least consideration in the supporting actress role.This film is especially appealing to amateur students of musical history (such as myself). I liked the portrayals of behind-the-scenes legends Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records and eventual producer great Quincy Jones. It was just an interesting time and fascinating to see on screen.Overall, a great film. My one and only beef, and I am loathe to point out any flaws, is in the pacing. There is a patch about 1/2 way through where the story doesn't seem to move, I think it could have used a tighter cut, perhaps 2:15 instead of 2:309 out of 10",9,5,6,5 November 2004
Casino Royale," Much needed refresh of the series, but they bollocksed up the ending!
","I haven't been to see a Bond movie in the theaters in 20 years, but I felt compelled to do so with Casino Royale. They promised an update to the tired franchise, and they delivered quite nicely.I like that Bond is now tough. I couldn't believe Dalton, and especially Brosnan, were tough at all. Suave, perhaps, but not tough, and suave just doesn't carry an action movie very far any more. Craig was so well-cast as Bond in this updating, it's like the film was scripted around him. Finally we have a tough-guy Bond, someone who could have been a Navy Seal if he was an American.I like that they've made him all business. In former Bond films, there were a few minutes with M giving him the mission, and then Bond would cavort all over the globe. This one, the 'head office' is involved in the storyline. Makes much more sense.I was a bit disappointed with the Bond gimmickry this time around. Bond always has cool cars and cool toys. Casino Royale definitely has some great cars, but the toys are pathetic: his cool car comes equipped with ... a defibrillator?? They should have just scrapped that scene completely, it is so out of place they should have bagged it.I can understand why they included that particular scene. Much of Casino Royale centers around a high-stakes poker game. When they were going to start playing poker, I groaned. 'Here comes the boredom', I said to myself. They tried to keep it interesting with regularly scheduled breaks, where Bond would get involved in fights. That worked great the first time (with a fairly exciting sword-in-the-stairwell fight), but then they put in this defibrillator scene. Goofy and a major plot hole. Why poison a player mid-game? Would a player who died during a game forfeit his chips? Sounds implausible.But it's Bond, and plot holes are a Bond tradition. At least these writers tried to make a complex plot. A good friend of mine pointed out this was not a typical Bond plot: no army of bad guys working for a single leader that Bond must fight through a la Mortal Combat. This is a convoluted plot involving terrorist funding, insurance fraud, money laundering, and kidnapping. You do have to pay a bit of attention. I liked it. It's no Academy-award winner, but at least they tried to make it intriguing.There is one glaring error that these writers made, however, one key point that I felt ruined the overall experience. They bollocksed up the ending! See, towards the end of the film Bond falls in love. Now, even mild Bond enthusiasts know James was married at one time. For this, the 'reboot' of the series, they absolutely needed to answer the question: who was James Bond's wife? And it looked like they were going to do just that, with Eva Green looking fabulous as Vesper Lynd. There was this whole setup with the two of them running away from the spy business and enjoying life. But what did the writers do? They turned her into a turncoat, someone trying to save her own husband from capture by Algerians or something. Then the film runs on with Bond trying to kill her in an act of revenge.The writers clearly blew it with that one. Here was their chance to put their permanent stamp on the series by showing us the circumstances around Bond's marriage and the eventual death of his spouse. It would have been the Bond equivalent of killing Spock in the second Star Trek movie: an iconic moment that would have made movie history and truly reinvigorated the series. But they went back to the same, tired, formulaic 'surprise' ending. They either didn't have depth of vision, or they chickened out with such culture-defining material.This movie was a welcome change for the Bond franchise, but it would have been spectacular if only the filmmakers had the foresight and capacity to finally tackle one of the greatest mysteries in the history of film: who was James Bond's wife.8 out of 10, points taken off for this egregious oversight.Barky",8,1,2,26 November 2006
Trainspotting," What a horrible movie! Two thumbs up!
","Trainspotting is the story of a humor, violence, goofiness, abuse, friendship and sadness in heroin-addicted Scotland.It's a really vulgar film, with lots of disgusting scatological humor, pointless violence, and the pain of a life on heroin.But it's very well done, with a snappy, realistic script, lots of genuinely funny moments, some truly moving and sad scenes about this horrible existence, and, in the end, many important things to say.I ended up liking this movie, even with the harshness of some of the scenes. I don't know if I necessarily need to see it again, but it's worth seeing once.8 out of 10.Barky",8,9,10,26 March 2005
Speed," A Lesson in Making Excellent Action Movies
","Speed is an excellent action movie. This is how action movies should be made. All producers of schlock ranging from Armageddon to National Treasure need to take a good, hard look at this film and learn something from it.The storyline from Speed is incredibly simple: madman threatens to blow things up if ransom isn't paid; law enforcement hero & co-workers try to stop him; innocent people in the mix throw in a wild card. The storyline is very simple and very linear and has virtually no complexity. And that is exactly what films like this require. They are action films, don't try to get all fancy with complicated plot lines. The audience wants to see stuff blow up, just get to it.The plot line is also believable. Sure, some of Speed's setups are pretty complicated (the elevator trick seems like an awful lot of work for a simple ransom gig). But overall it's written with great plausibility. The story has to be simple, but it also has to be believable, otherwise the audience is too busy laughing at the ludicrousness of it all to really get into the excitement of the film.The writing has to be crisp and to the point. There's not a lot of chatter in this film. This is an action movie, so dialogue is supposed to be short and sweet. No long discussions in a command center about what to do next, just think on your feet, bark orders out, make those snap decisions, and save all the small talk until later. Nothing ruins the pacing of an action film like laborious strategy discussions.The stunts have to be believable. Fans don't mind spectacular stunts, heck that's why we go to these movies! But the stunts can't be completely outrageous. Yes, the bus jump in Speed is outrageous, but the rest of the stuff is entirely plausible, and you can forgive one off-the-wall stunt. But most of Arnold's or Steven Segal's crap is so full of impossible stunts and crashes, they play like multi-million dollar episodes of CHiPS, where every highway crash involves cars doing cartwheels in the air...The actors have to be genuine. The best part of Keanu & Sandra's performances in Speed is they really play it with a high degree of believability. Keanu looks and acts like a hard-driven cop, too serious for his own good. Contrast that with his completely unbelievable performance as an undercover FBI agent in Point Break (a truly horrible movie). And Sandra plays it straight as a wise-ass woman who lost her license. She's not just a screaming bimbo but she also has a heart (as seen in the baby carriage scene). And the best part of these two stars? This film is not created as a star vehicle just for them, something you can't say of Nicholas Cage or Van Damme flicks.The action carries through the whole film. Some films (Bond films like to do this) have action then dialogue then action then love scenes then action then something else. If you're going to make an action flick then devise a way to have action through the whole thing. This film does just that, and without making it boring, either. Just when you think it can't get any worse for Our Heroes it does indeed, and that's good film-making.Other elements in this film are top-notch as well. The music is the perfect accompaniment to the story. The cinematography is not at all claustrophobic even though most of the action takes place on a bus. The special effects are seamless with the live action. The supporting cast is quite good as well (with the exception of Alan Ruck as the neurotic tourist, but that's really a bad part, not Alan's fault).All in all Speed is an example of how to make a contemporary action film.10 out of 10.Barky",10,0,1,30 July 2005
Final Destination," Quite good for a teen slasher flick
","I really liked this movie. It's probably one of the better teen slasher flicks to ever hit the screen.Let's face it: teen slasher flicks are not outstanding cinema. The writing is always lame, the plots are even lamer, they're usually vehicles for the latest trends in fashion and music and showcases of the heartthrob and/or bombshell-of-the-month. They're really just vehicles for post-pubescent hormonal stimulation.But 'Final Destination' is different. First, it has real imagination going for it. The plot is unlike your typical 'madman in the corn chases teenage bombshell through puddles,' it actually took some thought to put this together. It's not just shock-factor movie-making, they actually sat down and outlines how all the deaths would work in a way that keeps the plot alive. A tale of kids trying to cheat death's design is much harder to write than a dude with a chainsaw.Then there's the death scenes themselves. Outstanding! I love a clever death scene in movies like this ... it's why you pay the $8! And these are some doozies. You can tell the filmmakers sat around for hours simply trying to find the coolest way to kill people. And if you have a sick mind (like yours truly), you'll find these death scenes simply hysterical! A really good movie. 8 out of 10. I'm giving it a high score because it's outstanding within it's genre.Barky",8,29,38,5 June 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A great film, but something is not quite right
","The final episode of Peter Jackson's telling of the JRR Tolkien classic comes to screen.Return of the King is the big wrap-up to this landmark project. The filmmakers have done an excellent job bringing this 'unfilmable' project to screen. As always, they deserve kudos for such a beautifully crafter work. From the set designs to the costumes to the scenery, the CGI, special effects, sound, all of these elements are Oscar-worthy and far surpass anything ever shown on screen.The performances, too, are stellar. Ian McKellan, Viggo Mortensen, Miranda Otto, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, and Andy Serkis are all excellent. Even the supporting cast gives it their all. It is a shame Christopher Lee didn't make the final cut, but alas, it wasn't meant to be.Even with all these kudos, this film still has problems.The sequence with the Palantir in Edoras is very silly, I have heard others call it the 'Glowing Bowling Ball of Doom'. Rather sloppy for the quality the filmmakers have shown to date. And the ghost army is way too ... phosphorous and Disney-like.But beyond various technical flaws, the real problem is both the rush to the ending, and the drawn-out portion after the ending. For the former, we have the tense lead-up to the great Battle of the Pellenor Fields, which by itself is unlike anything ever put on film before. We have Frodo and Sam facing great dangers all by themselves. Then, suddenly, Frodo and Sam are back on track, the battle is over, and we rush right along to the climax of the film. That whole portion is simply rushed right along.So then we have the Big Finale ... and fifteen more minutes of movie (at least). Depending on how you count, there are five or six endings of the film. Here, unlike anywhere else, the writers have actually been too faithful to JRR Tolkien. His books also end (or not) in this fashion, and that is acceptable in a book, but not in a movie. The multiple endings simply drag us along to collapse. PJ should have kept some of that footage for a future DVD release.Even with these flaws, I have a hard time grading this movie poorly. I am, after all, a huge fan of LOTR and PJ. So I am cutting him some slack, and give the film 9 out of 10.",9,4,8,5 August 2004
Munich," Assassins Have a Soul
","The one and only problem this film has is the nature of the subject matter. Any film made from a contemporary event will *always* be subject to criticism; making one that involves contentious issues such as terrorism, Israel, assassination, or intelligence agencies simply amplifies that criticism to stellar heights.The best advice to give anyone going to see Munich would be to put your politics on the shelf while you watch. This is a VERY good film, with a VERY good performance by Eric Bana (he was so good I didn't even realize it was Eric Bana until the closing credits).This film does what so few intrigue movies do: it puts a human face on those doing the dirty work. Most films, based on real events or not, portray all operatives as cold-blooded killers or soulless robots. The screenwriters treat these Mossad agents as real people with real fallibilities, real doubts, real strengths, and honest reactions to incredible stress and danger.Above all, it's that last phrase that most aptly describes the power of Munich. Men are irrevocably changes by killing others, regardless of the justification. It changes one in many varied ways. Some collapse inward under the strain; some become more monstrous with every event; some become careless, as if they want to be killed in return; for every man it is different. This phenomenon, and the obsession of vengeance, are the two big themes of Munich.Beyond this, the film is well shot, quite fitting for the setting. It's also well cast and well acted, beyond Eric Bana there are good performances all around. And the score is pretty compelling, too. Not your standard John Williams' fare.I very much recommend this movie. 9 out of 10.Barky",9,0,1,14 January 2006
The Matrix," Overrated ... and boring
",The Matrix is quite possibly the lamest cultural phenomenon since The Blair Witch Project. It's all polish and no substance. Frankly I don't find any redeeming qualities to this film franchise at all.Lots of big flashy fight sequences with no context. Lots of high-tech special effects with no character. Lots of plot complexity with no heart.I plain and simply do not get what all the fuss was about.And it took me multiple tries to watch this film end-to-end without falling asleep in the middle. The whole sequence of Morpheus teaching Neo about the Matrix put me to sleep every time.Horribly overrated. In ten years people will look back on this and say 'what in the world was I thinking?'4 out of 10.Barky,4,8,19,4 November 2005
300," Completely Amazing!
","Ya know what?? Forget about historical accuracy or realism. '300' has little of that. But it doesn't matter. This is an amazing work of art. Yes, it's a violent work of art, but it's incredible nonetheless.I found practically every shot visually stunning. The color choices, the flow of movement, the camera angles, all overlayed with majestic music, this film is one of the most fantastic visual/audible experiences I've seen on film in quite a while. This is the first western film I've seen that truly emulates the majesty of such Oriental visual classics as 'Hero' and 'House of Flying Daggers'. It's absolutely brilliant.I think that, as a society, we've completely forgotten that film is a visual medium. That's a very odd thing to say, but it's true. When one really wants to create artistry on the screen, one has to remember film is really a canvas, a bare receptacle ready for whatever one wants to throw at it.Most filmmakers want to tell a story and put that story on the screen. And that's fine. But all they are really doing is putting that story into life (i.e. real actors in real settings), and simply using the camera to capture that story for show on a screen. Sure, that can work fine (witness Stephen Spielberg and other great filmmakers).But what Yimou Zhang does with his fantastic films, and what Robert Rodriguez, Zack Snyder, and Frank Miller have done with 'Sin City' and '300', is actually craft visual masterpieces directly for the screen itself. They aren't simply taking pictures of a story, they are actually crafting directly for the projection screen at your Googleplex Cinema.This difference between capturing an image, and CRAFTING an image, is understood by world-renowned, artistic photographers, and it is my hope films such as '300' will help spread this understanding among filmmakers.Oh, and the film has lots of beheadings. Gotta love beheadings.10 out of 10.",10,6,21,25 March 2007
Inside Llewyn Davis," Anti-Epic Coen Brothers Tale of an Anti-Hero
","There are people in the world who are, quite intentionally, their own worst enemy. This is their story. Alternately, it's about a man and his cat.Like all Coen Brothers films, 'Inside Llewyn Davis' is a character study. Theirs is a style that takes a trait of humanity, cranks it up to 11, and puts it through its paces. In this case, they take on people who purposely sabotage their own happiness.The film follows Llewyn Davis who, recklessly and tortuously, destroys his relationships at every opportunity. Time after time after time, he returns kindness with selfishness; responsibility with irresponsibility; support with abandonment. Grossly judgmental, incredibly unsympathetic, utterly foolish, this is a man who brings on his own suffering with an odd sort of sustained glee. He seems to revel in his own misery, constantly making bad decisions, and then getting mad at those who did what he told them to do.This is an odd juxtaposition with his chosen artistic pursuit: folk singing. Folk singing is all about empathy and connection, but Llewyn can't empathize, and definitely can't connect. This is pointed out to him time after time after time, but he just doesn't pick up on it. At all. Therefore, he fails. He is very similar to his co-star, Ulysses, a cat who (in a very characteristically cat-like manner) seems disconnected from what is happening around him, until it's time to wake someone else up from a sound sleep.It's not a bad film, there are some quirky, funny moments in it. But I gave it 7 out of 10 because it lacks that characteristic 'special heartwarming spark' of a Coen Brothers film. 'Raising Arizona', 'Fargo', 'Hudsucker Proxy', and 'O Brother, Where Art Thou' had a heartwarming character or situation to help pull you out of the morass of darkness, intentionally acting as counter-point to the misery of life; but 'Llewyn Davis' doesn't really have this. I suppose the cat is meant to fill this role (there is a neat little moment when Llewyn and the cat track each other's expressions quite effectively), but it doesn't really work as well as (possibly) intentioned.An OK movie. Not the Coen Brothers' best.",7,2,3,31 December 2013
Sin City," THIS is how to make a 'stylistic' film!
","I was not incredibly enthusiastic about seeing 'Sin City'. Lately there have been so many horrible films based solely around art direction ('Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' is the first one that comes to mind). Plot, characters, drama, tension, excitement, humor; all of these become lost when a film is based around a 'look'. Even some of those vaunted 'film noir' films of the past ... well, frankly they suck. Bad acting, lame plots. I never saw what the interest was in them. They may have been fine for their time, but now they are just patently uninteresting.I was very pleasantly surprised to see that 'Sin City' is not one of those films.This film has excitement; it has tension; it has very interesting characters; it has funny dialogue at times. In short, this is a fun (but violent) trip through a graphic novel.Benicio Del Torro is an absolute hoot. Elijah Wood is an amazingly believable (and creepy) assassin. Bruce Willis is great ballsy cop on the edge of retirement. And the women! Wow, are they hot! I've always been big on Rosario Dawson, but ... wow! So many cast members are excellent in their roles, and they play it over-the-top like the characters they portray.This is not a film for the kiddies, it is very violent, even gory at times. So it's clearly not for everyone. But if you like watching movies with a very dark edge, this is for you.This is also a film based on 3-4 different story lines (like Pulp Fiction). Not everyone likes that, either, so if you like linear storytelling this isn't for you.I do have to take off a few points here and there. Clive Owen's performance was pretty lackluster. And the edits between the various stories were too short, it ended up not flowing too well together at times.But overall a good flick. 9 out of 10.Barky",9,0,1,12 April 2005
Donnie Darko," Very strong, very powerful, but a bit cluttered
","Donnie Darko is the name of the depressed main character (ably performed by Jake Gyllenhall). Donnie is a genius, but like the stereotypical genius throughout history, is also on the edge of psychosis. It is indeed a dark and creepy film, but not really a horror movie, at least not in the sense of modern shock-value horror. This is a thinking person's horror movie, a psychodrama if you will.This film is not only the story of a mad genius trapped in the body of a horny teenager, but in a broader scope is a philosophical work about the meaning of existence, the meaning of God, the importance (or lack of importance) of the family, the essence of truth, the fabrications of commercialism, and the relative hotness of Christina Applegate.Confused? Well, the movie is a bit like that. I think the purpose is to make you think about all these things rather than provide any answers at all. When the end comes you're left a little bit bewildered, but that forces you to try to find meaning in the film, to see the points the screenwriter has tried to make.A very good film, well acted, with some clever camera work. Has an excellent script, plenty of humor from both the kids and the adults, and a lot of deep, thoughtful bits that make you go 'hmmmm'. Could have used a little trimming (like perhaps the entire infomercial character played by Patrick Swayze), but otherwise a very interesting film. I can see it has the makings of a cult classic (it may already be one for all I know).8 out of 10",8,0,1,26 November 2004
The Bourne Supremacy," So much better than Bond
","The Bourne Supremacy tells the continuing saga of amnesiac spy Jason Bourne (Matt Damon). A highly-trained assassin, Bourne snapped several years ago (as told in the film The Bourne Identity). Since then, he has lived a peaceful life with his girlfriend (the beautiful Franka Potente), away from the CIA and the world of espionage. Until, that is, someone comes after him...The Bourne Supremacy is a fast-paced, action-packed yet (almost) believable espionage thriller. Damon excels as Bourne, the character not has stoic determination but an emotional core filled with the terrors of his past. This character is so much better than the one-dimensional James Bond ever was: he's human, grim, deep, sad yet dangerous.This film is so much better than any of the Bond films in terms of human drama. Sure, there are no fabulous weapons, there is no endless stream of shaggadelic babes, there are no cars that turn into para-sailers. But there are the worldly locales, the incredible car chases, the sudden twists, the dangerous assassins (Karl Urban), the double-crossing inside operatives (the omnipresent Brian Cox), and the smart Deputy Director who has to figure it all out (the incredible Joan Allen). And all of it told in under two hours, the perfect length for a film of this type.I have only two beefs about this film. The director overuses herky-jerky, highly edited photography that is distracting (especially during a fight scene between Damon and a fellow CIA assassin, so hard to watch it may be seizure-inducing) and so over-used in today's cinema it's become a parody. Then there is this highly unbelievable, indestructible Russian-made taxicab tougher than the Humvees used by the Marines Corps. The only comic moments in this film involved this cab careening off SUVs and barriers yet still outrunning cop cars.These are minor quibbles compared to the rest of the film. 9 out of 10.",9,3,4,5 August 2004
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," What a fun and whacky movie!
","O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a very different kind of film. Ulysses (George Clooney) and two co-conspirators manage to free themselves from a chain gang, record a record, meet exotic women, battle a one-eyed Klansmen, meet up with lost loved ones, win an election and nearly drown. All set in the Deep South during the Depression, and all surrounded by some terrific folk music.I thought this movie was a lot of fun. The plot is goofy, the characters are goofier, the situations are quite ridiculous but that's the point. It's the Coen brothers! Only they could take one of Homer's epic poems, set it in 1930's Alabama and throw in a jug band for good measure!9 out of 10. Sometimes the goofiness can be distracting, but it really is a lot of fun.",9,0,1,5 November 2004
