Deja Vu," where do i start
","have our writers in the US lost all sense of logic? this movie lacks logic in the plot. he only starts the investigation because of the ship blowing up. in the course of the investigation he finds the clues that he leaves for himself when he changes history. however were he successful in changing history, there would have been no need for the clues or the investigation. had he changed history, he would never have been involved to begin with, thus no clues left. he would have had to find his own body in that case. good action and adventure. great explosions....... great SNL reference to needing more cowbell..no logic involved with the plot whatsoever",3,1,3,29 April 2007
