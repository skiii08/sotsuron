The King's Speech," Speaking with a voice
","Prince Albert, the Duke of York (Colin Firth) was tasked to represent his father King George V (Michael Gambon) to give a speech closing the 1925 British Empire Exhibition at the Wembley Stadium. He stammered throughout, and that was being broadcast by radio worldwide and those present at the stadium. Even if the Duke had given up finding a cure to his stammer, his wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) has not and sought help with Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), an Australian speech therapist living in London.The Duke of York would be persuaded by his wife to see Logue and during the first session, he calls him 'Dr. Logue' while Logue calls the Duke 'Bertie'. The Duke of York was surprised, given that is the name only his family uses to call him. Even if he felt that Logue's methods and his manners are unsuitable, Logue would wager a schilling with him that he would be able to recite Hamlet's 'To be not to be' soliloquy while listening to 'The Marriage of Figaro' on headphones at the same time without trouble. Logue would put the Duke's performance on record, and the Duke was convinced he had stammered throughout after the end and out of frustration, declared how he did as 'hopeless'. Logue would give the Duke the record as a keepsake.It would be after King George V had delivered his 1934 Christmas radio address, he explained to his younger son Prince Albert of the importance of broadcasting. The King was worried of how Albert's older brother David (Guy Pearce) would bring ruin to the family and country when he ascends to the throne, an indirect reference to David seeing the soon- to-be twice-divorcée in the American socialite Wallis Simpson (Eve Best). The King would let Albert recite the radio address he gave earlier as a form of practice, but to no avail.The Duke of York would later listen to the record of him reciting Hamlet, and he realised he had actually did it unhesitatingly. He and his wife would return to seeing Logue again, where the Duke would do physical exercises, even if Logue would gently probe along the way on the root causes of the Duke's stammer. That was when the Duke began to open up, and the two men became friends.King George V would pass away on January 1936, meaning that David would succeed his father on the throne and becoming Edward VIII. But it further complicated matters when the new king insisted on wanting marry Wallis Simpson even with his position as the head of the Church of England when the two brothers was at Balmoral Castle where the Duke of York and his wife were invited to a party hosted by Edward VIII. Edward VIII's insistence sparked a constitutional crisis, and he would return to his younger brother's stammer and accusing him of wanting his place.But before Edward VIII would eventually abdicate and thus thrusting his younger brother into the spotlight, the Duke of York would meet Logue again and spoke of the progress he has make. But the condition never improved whenever he is speaking to his older brother. Logue's suggestion that the Duke would make a better king than his older brother got the Duke accusing his speech therapist of treason and dismissed him on the spot.There were times watching Colin Firth first as the Duke of York before becoming King George VI, it was painful trying to imagine how it was like for the real Bertie trying to speak in public with his stammer. But it is only after the belief of Elizabeth and Lionel Logue, the future King George VI was able to believe in himself where all that training would prepare for his biggest challenge yet as a monarch. It is the story of a future king who had never believed in himself when speaking in public, and the wife and speech therapist who do.It is a film which gives hope to anyone, anywhere that if a king is able to overcome his stammer, they are able to do it as well. It became poignant when Firth as King George VI would say 'Because I have a voice!'. It does make one want to root for the king in the film, as what makes it compelling that it is actually based on real events and the personal notebooks of the real Lionel Logue. It even has the royal seal of approval from the reigning Queen Elizabeth II, the daughter of the king depicted in the film.",8,0,1,23 February 2014
Despicable Me 2," More minion action
","Something is amiss in the Arctic Circle and is worrying the Anti-Villain League, or the AVL. The AVL, headed by Silas Ramsbottom (Steve Coogan), had tried to recruit Gru (Steve Carrel), a former villain-turned-businessman and busying being father to Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier), and Agnes (Elsie Fisher). Gru would change his mind after his friend and assistant Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) decided to leave for new employment, and he would reluctantly work alongside AVL agent Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig).The bakery shop 'Bake My Day' at the Paradise Shopping Mall would be Gru and Lucy's headquarters while they go undercover to investigate who might have been behind what happened at the Arctic Circle. Gru would come to suspect it could be the owner of the Mexican restaurant Eduardo Perez (Benjamin Bratt), whom Gru felt reminded him of the villain 'El Macho' and believed to be dead.In between Gru and Lucy investigating if it was Eduardo or somebody else, Gru also has to deal with the realities of fatherhood and fending off claims from Agnes that he will fall in love with his new co-colleague Lucy. But just like in the first film, it was the minions which stole the show yet again. Whenever the minions get their space in the film like in the first, they never fail to provide the laughs.Watch it for minions who are as adorable as ever, but also for the transformation of Gru as compared to how he was like in the first film.",8,0,0,16 January 2014
Angels & Demons," Of merging religion and science
","The Roman Catholic Church is mourning the sudden death of the Pope. While there is mourning happening at the Vatican City, it is also preparing for the papal conclave which will elect on who will be the next Pope. Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor) assumes the temporary control of the Vatican while thousands have been pouring into Saint Peter's Square, waiting for the vote.Meanwhile at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), Dr. Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer), Father Silvano Bentivoglio (Carmen Argenziano) and their colleagues are initiating the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and create in three vials, suspended antimatter particles bigger than any that have been detected before. Dr. Vittoria Vetra searches for Father Silvano Bentivoglio and found him being killed and a vial missing as well.At Harvard University, Vatican police officer Claudio Vincenzi (David Pasquesi) found symbology professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) swimming at the university pool. Vincenzi's job is to summon Professor Langdon to the Vatican. Professor Langdon eventually followed Vincenzi to Rome, via a helicopter.Back at the Vatican, Professor Langdon met Dr. Vetra. It was there the two knew why they were being summoned to the Vatican, and what Langdon was being shown by Vincenzi back at Harvard began to make sense. The Vatican has been receiving threats from an enemy of the past in the Illuminati which has been threatening the lives of the four preferiti (the four most likely cardinals to be elected as pope) which the Illuminati warned of killing each cardinal at each hour, one each before midnight where by then, the Vatican will be destroyed in a burst of light. Langdon deduced from the video message which the Vatican received that the four cardinals will die at the four altars of the 'Path of Illumination.' But no one knows where the four altars are located. And the clock is ticking.The film adaptation of Dan Brown's mystery-thriller of between religion and science was originally meant to be the first of a trilogy which has the Harvard symbology professor Robert Langdon. But with the success of The Da Vinci Code which brought American author Dan Brown into the wider international audience, the adaptation of the original prequel to The Da Vinci Code has been viewed as a sequel to the 2006 release of the film adaptation of the novel. The timing of the release of the film adaptation of Angels and Demons is clearly reflected in the interest in the election of a new pope, like in real life, how Pope Benedict XVI was elected. In the novel, the papal election attracts little interest. Readers of the novel will also be able to detect other significant differences in the film. The camerlengo in the novel is an Italian, and not someone of Northern Ireland origin, as Ewan McGregor's character at one time in the film explained to Dr. Vittoria Vetra of how he came to be at the Vatican.As someone who has read the novel of the same name and thoroughly enjoyed it, there was a certain degree of expectation. But what saved the film for me were the scenes at the Vatican Secret Archives and the race against time to find out where the four preferti might have been kidnapped.",5,0,1,12 December 2011
Black Swan," The danger of seeking total perfection
","Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is a young dancer at a New York City ballet company, and she also lives with her mother Erica (Barbara Hershey), a former dancer herself. As the film begins, Nina dreamt that she is the Black Swan in Tchaikovsky's 'Swan Lake'. It would be the same ballet that Nina had dreamt about which would come to form the new season at the ballet company she is part of.The ballet company director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) wants a new approach to 'Swan Lake', wanting someone to play both the White Swan and the Black Swan for the production. But he wants a new face for the new season, which meant that Beth Macintyre (Winona Ryder) was forced to retire. Beth's anger at the news would lead to near-fatal consequences: Getting drunk at a banquet and hitting out at Thomas and Nina, before being seriously injured in a car accident which Thomas suspected was done deliberately.Before what Beth did which landed her in hospital, Nina auditioned to be both the White and Black Swan. While she performed well as the White Swan, she could not quite do it as the Black Swan which led her to persuade Thomas to reconsider. Thomas would forcibly kiss her before Nina bites him back in a sudden change of character. Nina would eventually get what she wanted, becoming the Swan Queen.But after being awarded the lead role as the Swan Queen, Nina started to witness strange happenings at the ballet company, and this is not including the tense working relationship she shares with the new addition at the company in Lily (Mila Kunis), and at home battling against her mother on the insistence of taking part in the production. As the film progresses, Nina began to understand how Beth must have felt to be forced to retire.There are times watching the film, one cannot but wonder at times what Natalie Portman's character was going through after being awarded the lead role was real or just of her own hallucinations, as it look very real each time. The production of 'Swan Lake' in the film may have being served as a backdrop, but it does make one stop and wonder whether questing for total perfection in anything is the appropriate thing to do.Regardless of how one views the ballet scenes in terms of how the likes of Portman or Mila Kunis's respective character dance to the music, ballet is never easy to begin with. But it is for certain that searching for total perfection can has its consequences.",7,0,1,19 February 2013
Miracle," Miracles come...if you believe.
","At times, I remembered where I was when some of the world's famous sporting miracles happened. Here in my country where people can be football-crazy at times (soccer in American English), we are more accustomed with football-relating events. With the current FIFA World Cup in Germany (football's biggest prize) still happening at the moment, I thought it's kind of a little freaky I saw this last night on the cable here.I had actually once watched this on the cable before. But back then I was watching more of the scene where it's USA against the Soviet Union. Now it's re-watching practically more or less the whole thing again. It's based on the real-life events leading to the 1980 Winter Olympics.Though it's months before the showdown in the 1980 Winter Olympics, Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) had already started with preparations for the ice hockey team. His tactics might had deemed radical at times to those around him, but then he still stuck to his guns.Because he knew what it feels like to almost winning that elusive goal medal once. Brooks, who was once part of the national ice hockey team, was cut out at the last minute in 1960 Winter Olympics and eventually witnessing from the TV his fellow teammates winning. He don't want history to repeat in front of his charges again.So after all that intense preparation, the big day beckons. People are starting to believe their national team can beat the seemingly-talented Soviets. Well...what happens after that is for everyone to see. It was the period of the Cold War then...but when miracles happened, everyone started to believe in their country once again.At times I do ask myself if I really believe in miracles. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. Sporting miracles are for those who really dare to believe because, who will have given them a chance in the beginning? I seemed to be seeing it at the World Cup too which is still going on...Trying to find some real-life awe-inspiring moment? Then this one is a good recommendation for you.",9,0,0,3 July 2006
Captain Phillips," Survival on pirate-infested waters
","Popular culture meant that piracy has always been romanticised. But in the real world, piracy is a real and serious issue and is happening. One such example took place in 2009 when container ship Marsek Alabama found itself to be a victim of hijacking off the Somali coast, a known hotspot for maritime piracy.Experienced ship captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) had been tasked to take command of MV Marsek Alabama, which is an unarmed container ship docked in Oman with the orders to sail through the Gulf of Aden to Mombasa, round the Horn of Africa. Meanwhile in Somalia, a team had been selected for preparing to head out to sea with the mission of hijacking a ship.With the route MV Marsek Alabama was taking, a warning system was issued to the ship on the possibility of piracy activity. Wary of what could happen when the vessel is off the coast of Somalia, Phillips decided to ramp up on security around the vessel and having practice drills with the crew. It would be during a drill where the vessel would be chased by Somali pirates in two skiffs. One of the two would be fended off after Phillips had outrun them and when he had called for support.But the day after, one of the two skiffs would be returned with four heavily armed pirates led by its own leader Abduwali Muse (Barkhad Adi) but with the ladder hastily welded the night before. Despite the best efforts from Phillips and his crew, the Somali pirates managed to board and capture the Marsek Alabama. By this time, the crew were hiding in the engine room as Phillips had told them apart from cutting the ship's engine power to while he had been captured by the pirates themselves. Even if Phillips had tried to negotiate with the pirates, they were insistent on wanting to head for the engine room.What happened in the film is actually based on the real-life events of the MV Marsek Alabama hijacking in 2009, the first time an American cargo ship had been hijacked in two hundred years. But it is also based on the experiences of experienced ship captain Richard Phillips who captained MV Marsek Alabama when it was hijacked from his book 'A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALS, and Dangerous Days at Sea'.What took place in the film may look dry at times to the viewer who may not be familiar with the workings of the maritime industry, but it helps to shed light to the challenge which has always plague the industry when it comes to piracy on the seas especially off the Somali coast. But what happened in the film is a reminder of how it can turn into a matter of between life and death, where it was exemplified by Tom Hanks's character. For how he did in the film is something recommended and worth the watch, alongside with the man who played the leader of the pirates in Barkhad Adi.",8,0,1,26 February 2014
The Sound of Music," The hills are alive...with the sound of music!
","I am someone in my late teens, and yet some may wonder why I like this movie which came out in the 60s. Interstingly enough, it was actually during my past History classes where my History teacher mentioned about this movie. The Nazi era under Hitler was part of the syllabus in my History textbook then and it touched a little in the movie itself.Enough of history over there. So, actually this movie was shown here last year like days before the musical version of it arrives here. Given my family has the tickets to go watch the musical (we were being invited to go watch), it was me who was actually more excited than anyone else in the family when the movie came out here on the local television to maybe somehow coincide with the musical production.Based on the events of Maria and the Von Trapp family (they do exist in history), the viewers are taken to beautiful sights in Austria. Now that is only a part of the movie plot. Maria (Julie Andrews) was actually a nun in a convent when one day she was being sent to be a governess to a family of seven children. When she was there, she began to bring to joy and music in the house, which was what the head of the house Captain Von Trapp once told Maria about the latter. Music was what was missing in the house. Ever since the passing of his wife, he had turned his house almost like a military of sorts.Each of the seven children has their own characteristics. It's especially interesting to see the eldest child and daughter being the one who told outright that she does not need a governess given she is 17 or something (thus the song 'Sixteen Going On Seventeen' and also one of my favourites) but yet in the end, she accepted Maria.But, the joy in the house was soon marred by the incoming occupation by the Nazis from Hitler. Anschluss, as it's being termed in German as meaning the union between two countries (considering what I had learnt in History is almost becoming rusty, oops). Captain Von Trapp was never a Nazi supporter and he make it indirectly clear. Also at this time, he has actually met a baroness and wanted to marry her. His seven children had never like the baroness one bit. They rather prefer Maria over her. Soon the Captain understood his children's intentions and he marries Maria.Still, given the political situation in Austria is getting a little sticky with the intending Nazi occupation, the Von Trapp family plotted a way to escape after a singing competition. And they managed it successfully.I know indirectly I am telling the whole plot outline...but I cannot help it. This is one movie musical which is just a pure winner not only in terms of the songs, other than the plot outline which is based on real events. Everyone in the family will be able to enjoy, regardless of age! Definitely a classic movie.",8,3,11,12 June 2006
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A classic!
","It was four years ago my family and I watched the 20th anniversary edition of the DVD. My father actually had fond memories of this movie when it came out (in his single adult years), mainly because of this famous line ' ET Phone Home'. After I saw it on DVD, I realised why my father said that.It's really touching and moving. The alien (ET) is also quite cute, maybe given the overall appearance is not what one can consider cute actually. And I can never imagine that I will see a young Drew Barrymore (given I often heard this movie is one of her earliest participation) on the screen.It's really amazing and heart-warming, especially when Elliot is very attached to ET though the latter has to be send back to where it belongs. It almost broke my heart as I watched. I almost cried. Yes.It first came out five years before I was born (okay, indirectly saying how old I am now...LOL) but then in its 20th anniversary edition, I guessed I knew why director Steven Spielberg is considered among the best in the business. It says it all in this movie.",9,1,2,20 June 2006
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," Brings back great memories.
","I was eight when my schoolteacher showed this to the class. Now, I am born in the late 80s and so this will give you an idea when I first saw this animated feature.Definitely it brought back so many memories for me. It was really sweet seeing all those dalmatians. I don't know maybe how many times I almost squealed when watching at that time. And even thinking at that time how many will be able to squeeze into my house... The drama was there as I was watching and I remembered at that time I had never like Cruella one bit.Overall, one of the best animated features I had ever seen.",9,3,4,30 June 2006
Kung Fu Panda," Believing in things they are to be
","The Valley of Peace could soon see the escape from prison of the snow leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane), as being visioned by Grand Master Oogway, an old tortoise. Tai Lung is also used to be the adopted son and former student of Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), an elderly red panda. He wants revenge for being denied the Dragon Scroll, which is said to hold secrets to limitless power. That alarmed Shifu, who sent the goose Zeng (Dan Fogler) to prevent the escape of Tai Lung.Meanwhile, giant panda Po (Jack Black) who has always being a kung fu fanatic and a fan of the Furious Five in Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), and Crane (David Cross), somehow managed to arrive in the arena which was to select the next Dragon Warrior to defeat Tai Lung. It was suppose to choose from one of the Furious Five who had all being trained by Shifu himself, but Po ended up becoming the Dragon Warrior instead, much to the dismay and shock to the Furious Five where they questioned Po's abilities to be one. Po is originally the son of a noodle restaurant owner in his goose father Mr. Ping (James Hong), and that originally stood against him.But what was originally thought of an accident from Oogway's part in his way of selecting the next Dragon Warrior, would lead to Po train hard under the guidance of Shifu. That is even if the Furious Five themselves tried to deal with Tai Lung himself, before realising how powerful he has become.What happens when it comes to the crunch, when Po and Tai Lung comes face to face with each other is definitely worth thinking about. In terms of how Po thinks about his kung fu abilities, and how Tai Lung sees his own as well. It is also what the film is trying to drive home as well.It is a film which moves away from the traditional stereotypes about kung fu, and brings home a simple universal message. It does have its comedic moments, but it is all done without resorting to clichés and stereotypes. It is actually enjoyable to watch to begin with.",8,0,0,25 January 2015
Shakespeare in Love," Nice masterpiece.
","My mother was the one who introduces me to watch this movie on the DVD she got five years back because she knew I have to study a few of Shakespeare's works (it's the case - Twelvfth Night, The Merchant of Venice & A Midsummer Night's Dream) in my English Literature class. And later on when I found out about the original rating for this movie here in my country, I became flabbergasted. I wasn't even of age when this movie came out here.Anyhow, I still survived watching the movie anyway.William Shakespeare (played by Joseph Fiennes) was trying to write this play he has been writing on. He has run out of ideas and is desperately needing of money. Then Lady Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) appeared and the two began a forbidden relationship, given Lady Viola is betrothed to Lord Wessex (Colin Firth). Viola actually became Shakespeare's muse for the eventual play which is maybe one of the most famous ones in our time - Romeo and Juliet.Some may wondered why guys have to dress up as women in plays in Shakepseare's time because at that time, women were actually not allowed on stage. But Lady Viola violated the rules at a great cost, given she did knew of the consequences.Overall, it's not what maybe some are expecting of a biography of Shakespeare's life. It's just a love story. I do actually like Queen Elizabeth's (Dame Judi Dench) appearance too. Or maybe it's because I'm one of those who are always fascinated over history. And maybe even literature as well.Nice movie over there.",8,1,2,17 June 2006
Happy Gilmore," Crude but funny.
","Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) had always wanted to be a professional ice hockey player. But somehow, he just could not make it. Then one day, his grandmother's personal belongings and the house she had lived in were both being confiscated because of not paying taxes for a long time.That became the reason why he make the unexpected move of from someone who had always wanted to be an ice hockey player to a professional golfer, in order to get back his grandmother's house. He immediately wowed the audiences with his long shots and the occasional eccentricity he displayed on the golf course.But with all the hype surrounding Gilmore's popularity, someone is not happy at it. He is Shooter McGavin. The professional golfer who has so used to winning titles is facing the threat of someone who does not fit into the golfing world. He tried ways to topple Gilmore and while initially the former had succeeded, Gilmore decided to buck up ahead of an important tournament.Well, whatever happened to McGavin...is almost everyone's guess.It may be crude at times to see Adam Sandler (who played Gilmore) fighting like an ice hockey player on the golf course whenever someone provoked him, but overall, the movie is just funny. Thankfully the real golfing world is not like that!",6,1,3,16 June 2007
Billy Elliot," A dream admist the struggle
","It was the 1984-85 miners' strike in Britain. The miners were on strike throughout the country, including 11-year-old Billy Eilliot's (Jamie Bell) father Jackie (Gary Lewis) and older brother Tony (Jamie Draven). Billy also lives with his grandmother (Jean Heywood).In the midst of the miners' strike, Jackie took his son Billy to boxing lessons. It was not what Billy wanted, and he one day chanced upon a ballet lesson going on nearby in the Sports Centre where he has his boxing lessons. Billy soon became interested in what he saw and initially took lessons secretly from whom will be his teacher in Sandra Wilkinson (Julie Walters) along with the other female ballet students in the class. It was something which Billy's grandmother would know about initially, as she talked about how she could have become a professional dancer herself in her younger days. Billy's father Jackie would come to know about the secret ballet lessons and he forbade his son from doing so. That did not stop Billy from taking lessons from Mrs. Wilkinson, which also intertwined with the miners' strike getting more violent and bloody.It would be when Billy was supposed to attend an audition at the Royal Ballet School in London which Mrs. Wilkinson felt that Billy has the talent which put Billy's talent on a collision course with his father and especially his older brother. There was a skirmish between the police and the miners which Billy's older brother Tony got involved and saw Billy missed his audition in London. There would be a major confrontation at the Eilliot's residence when Mrs. Wilkinson visited the family where it would become over whether Billy should be allowed to become a professional ballet dancer.It is quite a heart-warming and up-lifting film, of a young boy and his dream of wanting to be a ballet dancer and the obstacles he had to face along the way, considering of what was plaguing his family in the form of the miners' strike. The backdrop of the film which forms the basis also gives an insight of the struggle between the miners and the government of the day, for the non-British audience. Still, it is a film which gives hope to those who dare to chase their dream.",8,0,0,25 June 2012
The Fifth Element," Very futuristic.
","Will anyone want to believe that this movie was actually being used indirectly once for one of my Art lessons back then in my school days some years back?Our Art teacher actually showed us this movie and we had to watch to get ideas. Though in the end I don't get too much 'insipiration' out of it, I still enjoyed the movie anyway.It's only very much later on I realised this was directed by one of France's acclaimed directors Luc Besson. No wonder! Though I may not really understand much what was really happening in the movie half the time, I like that it looks so futuristic. But maybe given science fiction is not really one of those genres which is up my alley, it's a little of a pity though now I think of it.The music, the colour, the people...really like, wow in the movie.",7,0,1,19 June 2006
The Day After Tomorrow," One of those times to send the harsh but real messages home on global warming.
","This was one of those movies my father was kind of looking forward to watch when it first came out on the cable here. I know, being once a Geography student makes him aware of climate changes and all that in between.For me, since once the class few years back had to do researches on each type of pollution that each group has chosen (my group was on water pollution), it's something which has really made me more aware about the state of the world we are living in. Thanks to our careless ignorance of the increasing global warming.The movie centre around a climatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) who has been giving lectures on the impending danger of a new ice age on planet Earth, and his son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) who was caught stranded in New York with his friends because of the ice age. But in the movie, who will care a hoot on what Jack is saying anyway? And in the case of Sam, no matter how much he and his friends tried to persuade those who were trapped in the same building as them about waiting for help to arrive to them because of the alarming decrease of the temperature, not all heeded his word.Sometimes, it's all a matter of whether one wants to believe what others will say in desperate times. As it's often being told time and again that the truth is always stranger than fiction and the truth always hurts, this was one of those times which drove it home.I know I heard so many about this movie before I saw it with my family on the cable then, but then maybe sometimes we need a little 'pushing' to remember that our Earth is very vulnerable nowadays. And no one can dare to mess with Mother Nature when she's angry.",8,2,7,21 June 2006
Children of Heaven," The elements of childhood innocence
","How far will you go to get something you badly want? What happens if there is only a pair of shoes between you and your sibling, and your family is not well-off at all? It begins with Ali (Amir Farrokh Hashemian) fetching his younger sister Zahra's (Bahare Seddiqi) pink shoes from a cobbler who had repaired them. While Ali gets some potatoes, a garbage man accidentally picked up the pair of shoes and took them away. Ali would knock over crates of vegetables while trying to get his younger sister's shoes and is chased away in the process.With the financial situation of Ali's family, the landlord is arguing with Ali's mother (Fereshte Sarabandi) over being behind in paying the rent. As for the missing pair of shoes, the two began to devise a plan on what to do with it after Zahra had promised her brother not to tell their mother about it as they were doing their homework; while before that Ali's father (Reza Naji) had reprimanded Ali for not helping his ill mother when asked. The two siblings decided to share Ali's sneakers with Zahra wearing it in the morning to school before she returns it to her brother at midday so that he can wear it to class in the afternoon. This arrangement would see Ali being late for school three consecutive times with at the third time, the principal nearly wanted to send him away before Ali's teacher (Dariush Mokhtari) intervened.Meanwhile once at the school's morning assembly, Zahra noticed her missing pair of pink shoes were on another student Roya's (Nafise Jafar-Mohammadi) feet. She would secretly follow Roya home and later brought her brother Ali along to try getting her shoes back, before both learned that Roya's father, who is actually the garbage man, is blind. Zahra would come to be very dismayed when her new friend Roya tell her that her father had threw away the pink shoes after Zahra noticed the new pair of purple shoes Roya was wearing as a result of doing well in her studies.Ali and Zahra's father was anxious to earn extra money and decides to head for the rich suburbs of North Tehran to try his luck at being a gardener, with Ali accompanying his father. Not only that, Ali had learned in school of a long-distance footrace involving schools in the area and he noticed that the third prize is a one-week vacation camp and a pair of sneakers.The beauty of this film is how the child actors played their parts, with their innocence shining through at various moments. The fear of simply not having a pair of shoe to wear, of Ali temporarily making up to his sister Zahra with the gold pen which he got after being in the top three in a class test, and especially personally for me, of where the siblings were blowing bubbles. Even despite the agony of losing a pair of shoes, such scenes still appear.It may be something we take for granted in our daily lives, but Ali's determination of getting a pair of shoes for his sister after losing hers very early on is something to be admired, despite his age. It does remind us of what do we really treasure in our lives, and how despite the world we are living in, there are not many things in life which is as pure as childhood innocence as shown by the siblings in the film.",7,0,0,17 February 2013
A Bridge Too Far," Quite good.
","Being once a former History student myself and WWII is part of the syllabus, any movies relating to that era I will always try to catch it. This is one of those which I saw it just days ago on the TV here.Now, to the movie itself proper. The war is about to end. Telling from the viewpoints of the various Allied forces and even Germany as well, it showcases the failed attempt to capture several bridges to Germany in World War II in a campaign called Operation Market-Garden.When I saw the cast list over here, it's amazing that few of those are well-known till today. Sean Connery, Michael Caine, Gene Hackman, Anthony Hopkins and so on. No wonder it's like an all-star cast of sorts in a WWII-relating movie.What one of those things that my History classes never taught is that some of these stories surfaced during the war but often went unnoticed. Maybe this has to be one of those cases.I have to say eventually - quite good.",8,1,1,16 July 2006

Like any rookie just stepping in the real working world, she initially fumbled on her job and fitting in poorly with her colleagues, especially Miranda's senior assistant Emily Charlton (Emily Blunt).Andrea began to sacrifice her personal life to her new career, including changing her dressing style, with a little help from the art director Nigel (Stanley Tucci). While Emily is surprised at her new look, Miranda notices the change in her junior personal assistant and hands her more near-impossible tasks. Like securing the unpublished manuscript for the next book in the Harry Potter series for her twin daughters. Just when Andrea thought that she has been fired given she initially could not get the manuscript, it would be the up-and-coming magazine writer Christian Thomson (Simon Baker) who is also an acquaintance of Andrea's who said that he has it and saves Andrea from getting the sack at Runway.The charity benefit which saw both Emily (who is actually falling ill) and Andrea attending along with Miranda would eventually see Andrea being favoured ahead of Miranda's senior assistant Emily (whom forgotten one of the names of the people they were meeting before Andrea bailed her out), resulting in Andrea being chosen to go to Paris with her boss instead of Emily who have been boasting about it for some time. But just as Andrea is about to break the bad news to Emily, Emily is being met with an accident. The two had a confrontation at the hospital, before Andrea left for the art gallery which her friend Lily (Tracie Thoms) opened. Andrea saw Thomas there who gave her a kiss on the cheek, much to the horror of Lily. Andrea then confronted her boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier), telling him that she is going to Paris. The two realises that they have nothing in common, and broke up.It would be in Paris where apart from attending a fashion show with Miranda and actually meeting famed Italian designer Valentino, Andrea learned of her boss's personal plight and the day after, learning that the editor-in-chief of the French Runway magazine in Jacqueline Follet (Stephanie Szostak) would replace her boss. But Miranda had knew of the plot all along and told a stunned Andrea after attending a luncheon in honour of up-and-coming designer James Holt (Daniel Sunjata) of how she would announce during the luncheon that Follet will be the creative director at Holt's new company.While Miranda is pleased Andrea's show of loyalty by warning her of her position at Runaway and commenting that she sees a lot of herself in Andrea, Andrea replied that she could never do what Miranda did to Nigel (as he was supposed to be creative director at Holt's new company). But Miranda pointed out that she had already done so, by stepping over Emily. And told her that the choices she has made are necessary to lead the life that she is living. After the two had reached the event from the luncheon, Andrea did not follow Miranda and walked away, throwing her phone into a fountain on the Place de la Concorde when Miranda called her.It may be a film more suited for the younger set and for those who are interested in the insights of the fashion industry, the film which is a loose screen adaptation of Lauren Weisberger's novel of the same name (which Miranda Priestly is said to be based on Vogue editor Anna Wintour), is surprisingly good. This is from someone whom like Anne Hathaway's character early in the film who has not much dress sense and has a vague idea of the fashion industry. Meryl Steep who plays the Runway editor-in-chief Miranda Priestly portrayed it well, and Hathaway as the aspiring journalist who dreams of working for The New Yorker one day, did the similar thing in her role as Andrea Sachs.",7,1,2,23 March 2011
Bridget Jones's Diary," Just plain funny.
","I admit, it was maybe around the time when this movie was released here in my country then, it was the Hugh Grant and the Colin Firth factor which made me secretly wish I could go watch the movie. I don't know, it was just like that. Suddenly thinking the British guys can be uh, handsome.Five years on, I managed to catch it on cable.Adapted from Helen Fielding's novel, it's about the main protagonist Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) trying to set things right on a new year by writing whatever she wants to say in her diary. In her 30s and still a single and a little kind of plump, she is determined to get a man in her life. The movie began with Bridget who went to attend a party and she met her former childhood friend who is now a lawyer Mark Darcy (Colin Firth). Mark had been divorced with his wife and is single again.But on the other hand, Bridget's boss in the publishing company she works for, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) started to become interested in her. Bridget found out later that her boss and childhood friend actually knew each other back in their university days. And the two guys never seemed to be on a good terms even before Bridget is in the middle of them.It was made worse when Mark and Daniel realise they both like Bridget. Though Bridget found out once that Daniel had a girlfriend, Daniel told her they had broken up. And he told her that during her birthday. It was complicated to Bridget that Mark had did expressed his feelings to Bridget before Daniel came for the birthday party.Well, who ended up had the girl in the end? The childhood friend or the boss? Overall, I managed to catch the accents and I have to say Renee Zellweger did pretty a decent job in having a British accent for her role as Bridget to match with her fellow cast members. Definitely one movie which is just plain funny.",8,0,0,5 July 2006
Notting Hill," Pure magic.
","Being a fan of Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant, just imagine my total 'happiness' when this movie was shown here on television few years back. With me as well being a hopeless romantic of sorts, this is what I like.Can a famous female movie star and an ordinary man just get it along together? You will be surprised how it progressed. Julia Roberts as this famous movie actress in the movie happened to be in a Notting Hill bookstore which is owned by Hugh Grant's character. Then everything just happened.As this film is almost very British, watch out for some of the mannerisms. Maybe some of the lines can be cheesy and corny but then hey, it's love we are looking at here.Overall, it's just magic that both of among all my favourite celebrities are part of the cast. The whole thing just worked out for me and there is nothing more I can ask for.",8,0,0,28 May 2006
Grease," Grease...is the word!
","I remembered watching the 20th anniversary edition when it's on the television. It was kind of over-hyping then in terms of the media side, with also my parents remembering what happened to them when they were first aware of the movie during its original release. (It was way before they met each other.) The movie musical of a good-girl Sandy (Olivia Newtwon-John) meeting the greaser Danny (John Travolta) is the main plot of this feel-good movie. Being so retro all over again is something I had been so liking to be because not many I know is aware I am a closet retro music fan too. The song 'Tell Me More' between where Olivia's and John's characters is the one which always stood out for me because maybe...it's so darn catchy.For someone like me who was born in the late 80s...it's actually kind of interesting I do also like some of the songs before my time. Feeling like a real me all over again when I saw the 20th anniversary edition then.Grease is definitely...the word!",8,1,3,21 June 2006
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Who do you trust?
","Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore has died. The Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour (Bill Nighy) addresses the wider wizarding world at the Ministry of Magic, on Lord Voldermort's return of power.Meanwhile, Hermione Granger saw her parents were in the living room. Standing behind her parents without them noticing her and with a heavy heart, the Muggle-born talented witch began wiping away her parents' memories and erasing her from all of the family portraits which also included her childhood days. It is to remove her parents of any knowledge of having any memories of the existence of their only child. As for Harry Potter, he saw from his bedroom window as he sees his relatives pack up the car and leaving him behind. For Ron Weasley, he stood outside the family home of the Burrow, thinking about the task which lies ahead for him and his two friends.Severus Snape has arrived at the Malfoy Manor where Lord Voldermort is holding a meeting between himself and his Death Eaters (which also now includes Draco Malfoy). After Snape takes his place, he began to inform the date and time Harry Potter will be moved from his home. Not only that, Snape also added that the Ministry has been infiltrated. Voldermort then said that he must be the one to kill Harry, but he cannot do so as due to the connection shared between the cores of his wand and Harry's. It would be Lucius Malfoy's wand Voldermort uses and kills his hostage in the Muggle Studies professor Charity Burbage (Carolyn Pickles) and later feeds the body to his pet snake Nagini with the Death Eaters looking on.At Harry Potter's residence, members of the Order of the Phoenix (which now includes engaged couple Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour) arrived to bring Harry to the Burrow. But there is a problem. Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody explained that since Harry still has the trace in him (as he has not 17 yet, which in the wizarding world is under aged); they can't apparate or use the Floo network without being watched by the Ministry of Magic, so flying to the Burrow is the only way. But before everyone can go to the Burrow, they have to all disguise themselves as Harry first by taking the Polyjuice Potion. The plan is that if the Death Eaters attacked them while they are on the move, they will not know which the real Harry Potter is. The real Harry took off with Hagrid on Sirius Black's flying motorcycle, as before that with Harry releases his owl Hedwig to fly and meet them at the Burrow. As everyone takes off, they are being attacked by the Death Eaters almost immediately. Soon there was a chase, which even Hedwig is being involved but eventually got killed in the process. Harry then found himself being pursued by Lord Voldermort, and his wand acts on its own accord and defends Harry from Voldermort, destroying Lucius Malfoy's wand in the process.After Harry and Hagrid landed at the Burrow, the rest of the Order arrives, with everyone shaken of the attack and the betrayal. When George Weasley and Remus Lupin show up, it would be George having his left ear being cursed off. After George's older brother Bill arrives at the Burrow, he informs everyone that Mad-Eye Moody has been killed and that Mundungus Fletcher (Andy Linden) has escaped in fear. When everyone is asleep, Harry attempted to leave, with the guilt that people are either getting injured or died for him. Ron stopped Harry from leaving and convinces him of what he has to do, and that he should stay longer for Bill and Fleur's wedding. But Harry had a dream of Voldemort raging at an imprisoned Ollivander, the wandmaker, about Lucius's wand not working to defeat Harry.While everyone is preparing for the wedding, the Minister of Magic in Rufus Scrimgeour arrives and specifically meets Harry, Ron and Hermione. Scrimgeour then revealed that Albus Dumbledore has left them possessions in his will. For Ron, it is a Deluminator. For Hermione, it is a copy of a series of wizarding children's stories in The Tales of Beedle the Bard. For Harry, it is the Golden Snitch which Harry had caught it in his first Quidditch match. But that is not it as Scrimgeour added that Dumbledore has also left him the sword of Godric Gryffindor, but since it was not Dumbledore's to give away and that the sword is missing currently, Harry cannot receive it.At the wedding, Harry talked to Elphias Dodge, who had known Dumbledore and wrote the obituary in The Daily Prophet. Their conversation was cut short by Ron's Aunt Muriel (Matyelok Gibbs) who filled them with various stories of Dumbledore's past. Just then, the wedding was interrupted with by Kingsley Shacklebolt's Patronus arriving and informing that the Ministry has fallen, Rufus Scrimgeour is dead and the Death Eaters are on their way.Thus the uncertain times really begins in the wizarding world, with no one is sure of whom to trust and even the friendship of Harry, Ron and Hermione being tested in their search for the Horcruxes. The film is certainly not one for the faint-hearted, but watch it for why the title of the film adaptation takes after the seventh and final book of the famous series in terms of being called 'The Deathly Hallows'.On a personal scale, what stands out are the scene of Hermione removing the memories of her parents and herself from the family portraits, where the meeting of Voldermort and his followers is close to what I expected after initially reading the book, the 'Seven Harry Potters' scene which does provide some comic relief in a film which is surely not sunny given of the direction being taken as we are reaching near the climax of the series which will be revealed in the second part.",7,0,1,3 December 2010
Cold Mountain," Finding the long way home.
","I had heard news and stories about this movie before and so this kind of piqued my curiosity when I saw this on the cable days ago.I don't know much about the Civil War and all that, I have to say first. Given I only understand this is based on Charles Frazier's novel about the final days of the Civil War and that is it.It's the final days of the Civil War. Inman (Jude Law), being wounded from the war, slowly made his way home to Cold Mountain to be together with his sweetheart Ada (Nicole Kidman) once more. Along the way he had to overcome various obstacles as he had learnt that those soldiers who had escaped will have to be brought back to be on the battlefront once more. Something definitely not all those who had escaped wanted.Also at the same time, Ada is trying to keep her faith that Inman is still alive and well. She even got a helper for the house and it's in the form of gutsy Ruby (Renee Zellweger).I was almost horrified looking at the war how some of the soldiers treated the ordinary folk. Looking at how Ada and Ruby are like, they cannot be more different from each other. Maybe Renee's convincing portrayal of Ruby was the reason why she won at the Golden Globes and the Oscars as well.Maybe for someone like me who may not understand the historical aspects of the Civil War, but then maybe at least the love story part kind of won me over.",7,2,4,30 July 2006
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Something wicked this way comes.
","It's Harry's third year at Hogwarts. But as soon as after he left the Dursleys and set off for a new year at school, catching up with Ron and Hermione again, things were not as smooth-sailing as it seemed to be.The wizarding world is abuzz with the news that Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban. Many were convinced that Black was indirectly the reason why Harry's parents died 12 years ago. As a result of Black's escape, Dumbledore had ordered tighten security with the Dementors guarding the school. But somehow, Black managed to enter in the school compounds.The new school year even sees a new Defence Against The Dark Arts professor - Remus Lupin (David Thewlis). Sybil Trelawney (Emma Thompson), the Divination professor makes her presence. She may be eccentric at times and not many taking her seriously all the time, one of her predictions did came true.And when Ron's new pet rat Scabbers ran away on its own, a whole new set of adventures await the famous trio of Harry, Ron and Hermione. Which even led to who was the real person who went over to Lord Voldermort's side 12 years ago, leaving Harry's parents dead as a result.Lies, betrayal, friendship...do they really have a place in Harry's world? Something (really) wicked this way comes! It was really enjoyable, and I'm glad I finally catch it when it was on the television here few days back.",7,0,1,3 July 2007
Pearl Harbor," Very average piece of work.
","I forgot when was the last time this was shown here on the television. I know they showed it here a few times. I did watched in one of those times it was on the TV.Given I am once a History student, and WWII was part of the syllabus, Pearl Harbor is also part of it...though not much in detail in my History textbook actually... Anyhow, I still watched the movie anyway. Given this is about what led to America's participation in WWII, I just kept my comments to myself till the movie ended.And I realised after I saw the movie, what is really going on? Okay, I think the love story part might had played a little too much and spoiled the entire movie almost. Speaking from someone who once took History, this is not really what I had expected at all.This one is very, very average.",6,1,2,3 July 2006
Mamma Mia!," Let the good times roll
","After slightly more than a month since it's being released here, I finally get to watch it over the weekend at the cinema. I will always remember the original musical version for all the happy reasons - it was because of Mamma Mia! I went to the theatre for the first time in my life.Though it was four years ago when I watched the original musical when it arrived here. Having a father whom count ABBA as one of his favourite music groups in his teenage years, I began to like their songs as well. He did watched the original musical production when he was in London for work four years ago and it brought back all those past schooling days for him. And I have to say I didn't regret watching the musical production when it came here. Now anyone will wonder why someone who had only just been in her early stages of adulthood be liking a film which is based on songs coming out before way she was born. But then I actually grew up listening to songs from my parents' time, apart from listening to what is on the radio these days.To the review proper. Growing up, Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) had always lived with her mother Donna (Meryl Streep) on the small Greek island of Kalokairi where her mother runs a hotel. Sophie is going to get married to Sky (Dominic Cooper) and she wants her father to give her away on her wedding day. But the problem is, she doesn't know who he is and how he looks like. It was after she read her mother's diary from 20 years ago, she realised there are three possibilities. Sam Carmichael (Pierce Brosnan), Harry Bright (Colin Firth), or Bill Anderson (Stellan Skarsgård). The three men who had once entered her mother's life.The three arrived at the island, thinking it was their old flame Donna who had invited them. Sophie hides them upstairs in the old goat house, before revealing it was her who wrote the invitation. At the same time, other guests have arrived for the wedding and it even included Donna's friends: single writer Rosie (Julie Walters) and rich three-time divorcée Tanya (Christine Baranski).For many years, the hotel has been run down and while Donna was making repairs, there was a tremor and the dolphin mosaic in the courtyard floor splited. It was when she was searching for supplies, she heard noises coming from the old goat house after peering into the window, she realised the three men whom she used to date in her younger days had arrived. That was the beginning of what was to come. Donna confronting with her past, Sophie trying to find out who is her father.It's definitely a fluffy kind of film. Adapted from the original musical production, based on the hits of Swedish group ABBA, being brought to life to the screen. A young woman, searching for who is her father, searching for her past. A film which makes you want to know who is Sophie's father given after all, he only revealed himself towards the end of the film. And there is even a twist to the ending as well.Whatever I remembered back when I watched the original musical version, the important scenes were there. Though I actually know because of the time constraints, not all the scenes from the musical fit into the film. Of course I'm happy when my favourite scenes from the musical were being brought to the screen. Like when Donna was singing 'Money, Money, Money' when she was making repairs to the hotel, Donna and the Dynamos (the group she together with Rosie and Tanya formed in their younger days) in their 80s outfit, Tanya rejecting the playful advances of Pepper and some of Sky's other friends in 'Does Your Mother Know', when Donna sang 'The Winner Takes It All' to Sam.One thing did amazed me. Pierce Brosnan (who is Sam in the film) can really sing.If you like musicals and/or like ABBA, then Mamma Mia! is for you. For me, it's a case of both. My younger sister, whom I will never associate with listening to songs which came out way before she was born, had actually said after watching the film that she wants to see it again. That is just the impact of Mamma Mia!.",8,0,0,21 October 2008
The Pianist," A heart-wrenching movie.
","As this is one of those movies which is part of an Oscars special here on the local TV in March this year, I so know I have to watch. Being once a former History student myself, WWII and the prejudice that the Jews faced since the time of Hitler are among the stuff being discussed in my History textbook.Watching the movie which is based on a real life story is just so haunting. And with the WWII as the backdrop, it's even more heart-wrenching. It really made me so angry at how sometimes, there are those who have a prejudice against the Jews. Living in the modern times where we always talk about equality, maybe this is something I just cannot accept.It's really amazing to see how Adrian Brody who plays the famous Polish Jew pianist to really portray the emotions of how a Jew survive the horrors of WWII. War stories and events through the papers and my past History classes are what I only know of WWII so far and so this is something which almost blew my mind away. I may have watched those few documentaries my former History teacher had picked in relating to my History lessons before, watching the accounts of the war through the eyes of ordinary people is even more humane.And this is one of those movies. It's always very sad that in the end that a war only leaves nothing behind but innocent people who suffered or died from it. An amazing account from a Polish Jew who survived is just so...heart-wrenching.At least I know why it's an Oscar-winning movie after it ended.",8,0,1,29 May 2006
Schindler's List," Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.
","1939 Poland. Polish Jews from around the country were being relocated to the Krakow Ghetto. Meanwhile, ethnic German businessman Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) had also arrived at the Krakow Ghetto, hoping to make a fortune as a war profiteer.Bribing high-ranking officials to build a factory for the production of army mess kits, having a Polish Jew in Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) who is an official from the Krakow's Jewish Council as his accountant and administrator in his factory. Stern would also be credited for typing the list of names eventually famously known as Schindler's list, the Jews who would come to survive the Holocaust because of his boss Oskar Schindler. Schindler had originally hired Polish Jews instead of Polish Catholics because of cheap labour, but he soon realises the horror of what some of his workers were going through. It is in view of SS Lieutenant Amon Göth (Ralph Finnes), who at the concentration camp, oversaw the massacre (which eventually came to be known as the Operation Reinhard in Kraków) where those who were protesting or appeared uncooperative were to be shot.Oskar Schindler who saw what was going on from the hills overlooking the area with his mistress, become increasingly affected by those whom he call 'his' workers. Mindful of his friendship with Göth, Schindler brides him to build a sub-camp for his workers in order to prevent any more random execution.There is a reason why Oskar Schindler will always be celebrated for what he did for the Jews he had managed to save during the Second World War, despite the various faults he had as a person. Acclaimed film director Steven Spielberg, who based the film on the novel 'Schindler's Ark' written by Australian novelist Thomas Keneally (which the inspiration for the work in Poldek Pfefferberg, who is one of the many Schindler Jews was the one who decided to bring the story of Oskar Schindler to the wider audience), has make the film such that we are being transported back to the actual war years itself with the black-and-white images. That is with the exception of the opening sequence and what happens after the war ended where it is in colour.Liam Neeson played well in his role of Schindler, while Ralph Finnes perfected the role of SS Lieutenant Amon Göth, to the extent it was rather convincingly that it could be really Göth himself.While it is a film depicting the horrors of the war and how one ethnic German decided to go all out to save as much as he could despite his Nazi connections, it is also a film which is still relevant in the times we are living in apart from the fact that the Holocaust denial is still alive in certain quarters and neo-Nazism has not really gone away.",9,10,15,21 March 2011

Moulin Rouge!," Sheer musical excitement.
","There has to be a reason why this movie musical was shown twice on our local TV. I even watched it twice, though the second time never really watched from start to end. Given Nicole Kidman is one of my favourite celebrities, it's one of those reasons I watched it.Christian (Ewan McGregor) is a writer desperately searching ideas for his works till he was being thrust into writing a play, by accident. He went into Moulin Rouge and met some very interesting and colourful characters and people.Satine (Nicole Kidman) is the most famous courtesan at Moulin Rouge and many are stunned by how she looked. Though she is being engaged, she began a forbidden love story with Christian.The song and dance are a big draw to this movie musical and both Ewan and Nicole can actually sing well. 'Come What May' is just so touching which almost made me cry. I know.Watch it not because Nicole Kidman is in this movie musical (which I soon learned). Watch it because it is just so beautiful.",9,1,3,23 July 2006
Lincoln," The presidential courage of a lifetime
","The audience has already being warned of what is to come before the film officially begins. Like it would be the case before it would show at times throughout the course of the film of the mentions to the names of the prominent scenes it is showing and the people involved, a short introduction for the international audience who are not tuned in into what the film is going to be about.It might have been about Abraham Lincoln's final months in office starting at the turn of 1865, which is how the film begins, but there were two things Lincoln (Daniel Day-Lewis) was attempting to grapple with before he officially begins his second term later in the same year. The effort to negotiate an end to the painful and bloody American Civil War, and persuading a divided House of Representatives to vote for the passing of the 13th Amendment which is to abolish slavery once and for all. The opening scene after the introduction gives a glimpse of what Lincoln has to deal with, a battlefield of white and black men fighting and casualties from both sides before his meeting with four young white and black men (Lukas Haas, Dane DeHaan, Colman Domingo, David Oyelowo) waiting to join their companies while they recited excerpts from what he said at the Gettysburg Address from two months before.After that, it is dominated by scenes of where the American soul, identity and psyche are to be fought and form the basis of this film. Private meetings with the likes of one of his closest advisers Francis Preston Blair (Hal Holbrook) and his family and meetings in his office with ordinary people like a Mr. and Mrs. Jolly (Bill Camp, Elizabeth Marvel) which he termed it as his 'public opinion baths', cabinet meetings with his administration in the likes of Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn), Secretary of War Edwin Stanton (Bruce McGill) and Secretary of the Interior John Palmer Usher (Dakin Matthews) along with the Republican congressman often present at those meetings in James Ashley (David Costabile), the verbal battles between the House of Representatives members at the chambers over the debating of the 13th Amendment with Fernando Wood (Lee Pace) and leader of the Democrat opposition George Pendleton (Peter McRobbie) representing the Democrats and Radical Republican Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) representing the Republican Party which is controlling the House at that time.Lincoln the politician and president is a consummate one at best in terms of trying whatever means possible, even on the verge on doing arm-twisting deals for the procurement of votes for the 13th Amendment from especially the lame duck Democrat congressmen who had lost the re-election two months before via the lobbying group Seward had organised consisting of people like William N. Bilbo (James Spader), Robert Latham (John Hawkes) and Richard Schell (Tim Blake Nelson), giving illustrations to tie in with what he is to talk about and telling seemingly irrelevant stories on cue which before Lincoln did led to his Secretary of War Edwin Stanton not able to tolerate him as they were waiting for news from Wilmington at the War Department. But Lincoln the family man is a different matter altogether in terms of his relationships with his eldest son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and his wife Mary (Sally Field). The death of one of their younger sons in Willie three years before the film begins had complicated the husband-wife relationship between the president and the First Lady and that also influencing Mary on her insistence of not wanting to see Robert on the battlefront. Even despite studying at Harvard at that time and coming home to see his family at the White House, Robert has always insisted on wanting to serve in the Union army.But at the end of the day for all the procurement of votes and the verbal battles between the Democrat and Republican congressmen, Lincoln is still trying to figure out what the black population signifies to the United States of America as a whole should the 13th Amendment be passed in the House of Representatives after all. A conversation with his wife's black dressmaker and seamstress Mrs. Elizabeth Keckley (Gloria Reuben) would provide food for thought.While the likeness and voice for the 16th President of the United States is there for Day-Lewis which does feel at times it is the real president himself speaking, special mention has to go to Tommy Lee Jones and his portrayal of Thaddeus Stevens, for his performance and the wit he has always especially reserved for his Democrat colleagues at the House of Representatives in Wood and Pendleton which provided some of the best scenes in the film, apart from when Day-Lewis's character nearly lost it in front of his cabinet colleagues after they were squabbling among themselves.Keen observers of American history and/or politics will know what the final outcome of the 13th Amendment was, but it is something when director Steven Spielberg is able to pull off the suspense almost to the end. Still, it is something to have the audience at the edge of their seats, wondering whether the amendment is able to pass or not. Politics was never meant to be a glamorous thing in the first place even in the 19th century United States of America, but it is a glimpse of what can be made possible despite the various strong challenges and obstacles along the way.",8,0,1,23 February 2013
Million Dollar Baby," A little melodrama, but still as good.
","Heard so much in regards to this Oscar-winning movie and it's amazing how generally I had read over here over the comments. It proved why this won the Best Picture Oscar last year.Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) is a waitress who wants to be a boxer and met Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) and asked him to be her trainer. Narrated from the point-of-view of Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman), it tells how Maggie is so determined to be a boxer that even Frankie has no choice but to coach her.The narration somehow added a little 'darkness' into the movie and that is almost like the general feeling of the movie. It may look a little draggy for some, but then looking at how Maggie is so determined to make her mark and not just being a waitress for her entire life, at times we really need to ask ourselves about our purpose of life. Sounds a little cliché, but always worth considering about.It's a little dark at times, but the plot is enough to make us ask about so many things in life.Hilary Swank is so into her role as the determined female boxer Maggie that it's hard at times to remember that she is just portraying Maggie. Clint Eastwood as the trainer Frankie, quite good. Morgan Freeman being the narrator, not bad.",8,0,2,9 July 2006
World Trade Center," 9/11...revisited.
","Ever since whatever happened on September 11 2001, people often asked each other what did they do on that day. From then on, it became one of those dates where it naturally entered the history books like the time when the Berlin Wall fell.But back to the movie. Based on real-life accounts of New York Port Authority Police Department's Sergeant John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and his colleague, rookie cop William Jimeno (Michael Pena), the movie brings us back to the day which eventually changed the history of the 21st century since.It started as just another day in the lives of these two men and their other colleagues at the Port Authority Police Department. They all went about doing their work till they received news that a plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. Some sounded sceptism at first, but whatever happened on at the streets of New York City later led to the men thinking that this was something big. McLoughlin and his team of volunteers entered one of the two towers. When the building finally collapsed, it was too late.They were being trapped under 20 feet of steel and concrete and, silence.Above ground, the country and the rest of the world (from Africa to Europe to the Asian continents, as being shown in the movie) started to comprehend what really happened. This even included McLoughlin's wife Donna (Maria Bello) and Jimeno's pregnant wife Allison (Maggie Gyllenhaal). Allison was especially hysterical, given her conditions. It was quite a terrible ordeal for the two of them when they learnt that their husbands were among those reportedly unaccounted for.Inside the rubbles, the two men kept themselves alive by chatting with each other about their lives and exchanging Starsky and Hutch trivia. They never knew that above the ground, ex-Marine David Karnes (Michael Shannon) was determined to find if anyone was still alive below the rubbles.Criss-crossing various groups of people who all came together on the fateful day, director Olivier Stone paid tribute to those who survived and those who were among the 2,759 perished. McLoughlin and Jimeno were among the 20 who were being rescued alive from the World Trade Center's rubbles.If one had noticed, the replica of Ground Zero just looked so real that it is just like the real thing. It was specially created to give the raw feel of the rubbles. And I am also lucky to sit through the entire movie over the weekend at the cinema given some of the scenes are just, painful to watch.Emotion and humane and courage, this is what the movie is just trying to do.",7,1,4,15 October 2006
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Surprisingly good.
","Summer has arrived but it's not something Harry liked, after what happened at Hogwarts before the holidays. What was meant to save his cousin from the Dementors resulting in Harry being framed (as usual) by his uncle and aunt while they take Dudley to see the doctor's. Harry had no choice but to perform the Patronus Charm before it was too late for his cousin as the Dementors were near Dudley. So, a letter came for Harry from the Ministry Of Magic to attend a hearing regarding what he has done.After Vernon and Petunia left the house with Dudley to bring their son to the doctor's, members of The Order Of The Phoenix (Tonks, Moody, Kingsley Shacklebolt and etc.) arrived at the house and they come to bring Harry to the Order's headquarters which happens to be Sirius Black's residence ahead of the hearing. It was at Black's residence Harry wanted to know what has been happening since the summer began. It was then Harry learned more about The Order Of The Phoenix.On the day of the hearing, it was Arthur Weasley who brought Harry to the Ministry Of Magic. But they have to act as ordinary human beings first by blending into the ordinary London crowd before they arrived at the Ministry which Arthur knows where it is. Once Arthur and Harry arrived, Harry can only be the one to attend the hearing and it's Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic who is overseeing the hearing while there is a whole group of jury behind him to hear Harry's case. The Headmaster Albus Dumbledore arrived just in time to help clear Harry's name. Arabella Figg (Kathryn Hunter), whom Harry saw after he defeated the Dementors, became the witness as to what happened. Eventually, Harry was cleared of all charges.It was back to school and many chose to ignore Harry, except Ron and Hermione and a handful of others like the Weasley twins, Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch), Ginny, Cho etc. Almost everyone in the wizarding world thinks Harry is mad. Not everyone is believing that Lord Voldermort has returned and is actually more powerful than ever. After the trio returned to school, Harry saw Cho but she was with her friends. It was also then the trio saw the loony Luna. At the feast, it was being made known by Dumbledore that Hogwarts has a new Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher - Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton). She was last seen at Harry's hearing.It was the beginning of what's to come from Umbridge. No learning of practical magic, only what is being approved by the Ministry and nothing else. And under the orders of the Ministry, she has become from the Undersecretary to Fudge, to Hogwarts High Inquisitor and later on, Headmistress (Dumbledore was being sacked from his position as Headmaster). The last thing happened after she managed to find out about the secret army that Harry and his friends were part of - Dumbledore's Army. It was Hermione's idea given they are not learning much ahead of their OWLs. Harry was the only one who can teach proper magic, based on what he had experienced. In order to save Harry, Dumbledore said that he was the one who gave Harry the approval to form the group. Given the formation of societies was banned under Umbridge's so-called Educational Decrees.With the wizarding world divided on people believing that Lord Voldermort is back and those who don't, which group will win in the end?What impressed me was especially Imelda Staunton's role as Dolores Umbridge. In JK Rowling's best-selling series, Umbridge is whom many hate because of what she is - her appearance, squeaky voice and etc. Staunton almost perfected it.I was initially worried the movie may not live up to its expectations for me, given I had once read the book. But I understand not many things were in the movie because of the timing. Except for a few personal complaints, I actually like it overall. It never disappointed me.",7,0,0,15 July 2007
Annie Hall," Love, quite contrary
","The comedian Alvy 'Max' Singer (Woody Allen), opening his monologue, is trying to understand why his relationship with Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) ended a year ago. Growing up in New York, he had vexed his mother on the emptiness of existence while also being preoccupied by his own sexual curiosity.It would later show Alvy as a grown up, now with Annie but getting into an argument as they went to queue up in a movie theatre watching 'The Sorrow and the Pity'. There would be someone in the queue just behind them who would especially annoy Alvy on interpreting loudly on the works of Marshall McLuhan. It would be not long the real man himself steps in to correct what the man in the queue behind Alvy had been talking loudly about.Later that night, Annie had no interest in having sex with Alvy. Instead, the two would discuss about Alvy's past two relationships. The first was Alvy's first wife Allison Portchnik (Carol Kane), the second was an intellectual. It is different when it comes to his relationship with Annie, along with Alvy mocking the men Annie had once being involved with before it would show how Alvy and Annie first came to know each other. Things started to get tense when both were beginning to like each other, in terms of their view of the world and their respective family backgrounds which Alvy found out when he met Annie's family.While Alvy did try to see other people after breaking off with Annie for a period of time, he still finds himself coming back to her, but after Annie was calling him for help on the phone. But separate meetings with their respective therapists showed that there is still a divide between them.If one is able to follow the story well, one is able to understand the story Woody Allen's character Alvy is trying to tell about especially his relationship with Diane Keaton's character Annie, and the two's views on love and relationships in the film itself. The interchangeable scenes as Alvy is trying to explain his own life and past relationships, inserting with the present-day version of himself when revisiting something from his past, may seem confusing at times to some in terms of trying to catch what he is trying to put across.But the quirkiness of Allen's character speaking directly to the camera at times, seemingly trying to emphasis or tell the viewing audience something is definitely something refreshing. And the randomness of Keaton's character randomly breaking off into 'La-dee-da, la-dee-da' when she has nothing else to say brings out the spontaneity.",7,0,0,12 March 2013
Pride & Prejudice," First Impressions.
","Many had regarded the novel version as Jane Austen's best work ever, and it's more or less easy to see why. I had heard about Colin Firth's near-perfect interpretation of Mr. Darcy in the BBC series and it did not really affect me much prior to watching this film.Mr. and Mrs. Bennet (Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn respectively) has five daughters - Jane, Elizabeth, Kitty, Mary and Lydia. For all of Mrs. Bennet's married lifetime, it is to find suitable husbands for all of her daughters. But for the second one Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) or Lizzie as she is affectionately known, she does not want to be married no matter what.One day, the Bennets received news that a wealthy bachelor and his friends are coming to take up a summer residence nearby where they are residing. Naturally especially for Mrs. Bennet, this is good news. At the ball, there's Charles Bingley (Simon Woods) and his sister Caroline (Kelly Reilly) and even Bingley's friend Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfayden).So while Mr. Bingley had been taken with the eldest Bennet daughter Jane, Lizzie does not like his friend Mr. Darcy at all. She thought he is just arrogant.Or is it really the case? Jane Austen's work of the same name certainly lives up to its film version. With all that beautiful setting which is so Georgian England in Jane Austen's time, it's quite a joy and delight to watch it. And given it's being a while since I first read the novel, it certainly brings back a lot of memories to me.",9,1,3,4 February 2007
Chariots of Fire," Inspirational, and which almost drove me to tears.
","It's been a year since London is being awarded as host for the 2012 Olympics. I know this all too well, because it was announced from here in my country a year ago. The man responsible for bringing the biggest sporting event on Earth to London (six years from now, given now a year has passed since) is also the one who once reenact the scene (the running scene on Cambridge grounds between Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams) with his then-rival on the track Steve Ovett - Sebastian Coe. Interestingly back then when I was reading and checking about his life as the Olympic runner, this movie's name surfaced.This is how it all began. Very interesting way of how I learnt of this movie.This is based on the real-life story of the lives on a British Jew (Harold Abrahams) and a Scottish Christian (Eric Liddell) in leading to the 1928 Olympics in Paris. One who run for the sake of removing those prejudices against fellow Jews like him, and the other who did it for the sake of his religion. Their lives crossed each other many a times, from the time of their Cambridge days. Liddell even made a radical decision not to participate in a race which was supposed to be held on a Sunday when the Olympics was going on at that time. Doing it for the sake of his religion.A moving and inspirational story where people do a common thing (in the case here, the Olympics) for the sake of very different reasons. The opening theme to the movie...I so know at once it's the one where it is often used for mega events like the Olympics. One of those tunes which still kept giving me goosebumps whenever I hear it! This movie - definitely really recommended.",9,0,2,6 July 2006
Life Is Beautiful," When you believe in hope
","1939, Arezzo, Italy. Carefree Jewish-Italian Guido Orefice (Roberto Benigni) has come to the town with intention of opening a bookstore. But meanwhile, he is working as a waiter at the hotel restaurant where his Uncle Eliseo (Giustino Durano) is the maître d'. Not only that, he met and fell in love almost immediately at the female schoolteacher Dora (Nicoletta Braschi) whom he calls 'princess'.And that is despite Dora is being engaged to another man, but whom she did not like at all. Guido began popping up at unexpected timing in order to woo her. On the day of Dora's engagement which happened to be taking place at the hotel restaurant where Guido was working, he managed to whisk her away in a green horse. They managed to live happily for five years at the house of Guido's uncle, having a son along the way in Giosué. All these while the Second World War was already taking place.But on the day of Giosué's fifth birthday, the Germans came and took away Guido and Giosué, just when the family was preparing for Giosué's birthday party. Wanting to be with her family, Dora (a non-Jew) insisted that she would be taken as well. But she would be housed at the women's side of the camp.Pretending that he knows German when a German officer requires a translator, Guido claimed that they are playing a game and they have to collect points in order to win the prize which is a real tank. Guido did that in order to protect his son from the real reason why they are being sent to the concentration camp.At the camp, Guido tried to build up hope for his son Giosué but his own days were beginning to be numbered. Realising his plight, he had Giosué hiding in a junction box, telling him that everyone is actually looking for him. And that is while he tries to free his wife Dora from the camp and giving his own life away at the same time.The day after, the Americans entered the seemingly deserted camp just as Giosué emerges. Hitching a ride on the tank from the American solider, Giosué soon spotted his mother and they were being reunited.It may be a fictional story set in a real-life scenario amidst the backdrop of a war, but the fact that the father would go all lengths to try telling his son that it is all a game and he will get his prize if he collects the points required to win a tank, it is very admirable considering of the situation the family is in. It is actually very heart-warming, with award-winning actor Giustino Durano who plays Guido reminding us why, life is beautiful.",8,2,4,17 January 2011
National Treasure," Endless adventure indeed!
","I realised that this movie was released two years back. The freaky thing is that, Dan Brown's Angels & Demons came out on in 2001. I have to admit only after reading that book recently, I then only know about the Illuminanti and the Masons. Those two groups were mentioned in that book.So imagine I was gasping away when those various references to the Masons showed up as I saw this movie on the cable. I am do aware of the Mason's probable role which led to the independence of the USA, because that mention first came out on Angels & Demons. I knew it was somewhere in there. The Knights Templar mention in this movie also almost got me gasping because to admit again, I am only aware of that after reading - The Da Vinci Code. Yes.So, this movie first started in the year of 1974 and a young Benjamin Franklin Gates accidentally found something which led to his grandfather John Adams Gates (Christopher Plummer) to tell him not to look at those documents. John Gates then tell the story of their ancestors' role in the founding of the independent America. But the thing is, John's grandfather's life was counted and so he only left behind a code. Clearly when Patrick Gates (Jon Voight) saw that his father is telling that to his son, he was not pleased. But that does not stop the young Ben from really finding out what was the treasure is.Fast forward to the present day. The now adult Benjamin (Nicolas Cage) is travelling with his friends to the Arctic in hoping of searching the clue which his grandfather had told him when he was young. And when they did, Benjamin realised one of his friends Ian is also wanting to steal one of the most important documents in the history of America - The Declaration of Independence. It's what Benjamin, who is part of the famous Gates family, who wanted it first.But there is a catch. The Declaration Of Independence is highly guarded. So this led to endless chases from the police and even the friend who turned against Benjamin - Ian. With the help of Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), Benjamin and everyone else included (even the father Patrick eventually) started to search from one clue to another, bringing them to various places throughout the country.The endless adventure and non-stop fun and history (I am a little history buff at times) were what left me enthralled and speechless. Almost something like out of The Da Vinci Code (that book came out in 2003) but not really the case, it almost left me breathless. Maybe given I did read Angels & Demons and it's where I only began to know about the real existence of the Masons, whatever this movie might had mentioned, it always brought me back to the time when I read that book.Adventure is the key to this movie and if anyone likes it, it's a good recommendation.",8,0,1,2 July 2006
Pretty Woman," The transformation of a pretty woman
","Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) is a businessman who specialises in taking over companies and then selling them off piece by piece. On a business trip in Los Angeles, he has gotten lost and takes on detour on Hollywood Boulevard, asking for directions. While he did so, he encountered a beautiful prostitute in Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts) who is willing to assist him in getting to his destination.The morning after, Edward hires Vivian to stay with him for a week as an escort for social events. As the week went, little by little, their feelings for each other grew. Along the way, Vivian has also being transformed in her appearance, which blew Edward away. But at the same time, the time spent with Vivian has also changed Edward's outlook on life which Edward's attorney of 10 years in Philip Stuckley (Jason Alexander) accuses her of. Philip tried to rape her before Edward arrived in time, punching his attorney and forcing him to leave with his belongings.While Edward tended to Vivian and tried to convince her to stay with him, she refused and returns to the apartment she shares with her friend Kit (Laura San Giacomo), preparing to leave for San Francisco in the hopes of a better life than the one she is having. Edward then got into the car which took her home.And instead of heading for the airport, he went to her apartment. Despite his fear of heights, he climbs up the fire escape with a rose clutch between his teeth and the intention to woo her. The limping from the limousine, climbing the outside ladder and steps...all are the visual metaphors of what Vivian had told Edward about her childhood fantasy. The knight on a white horse rescuing the princess from the tower. It ended with the two kissing on the fire escape.It was the film to have said to really launch Julia Roberts's career, and that is not that bad considering it has always been considered as one of the best modern romantic comedy films. And the accompany songs to the film also compliments well, with Roy Orbison's song which inspired the film stands out in the scene which Julia Roberts's character went on a shopping spree with a totally transformed Vivian from the first time where the salesgirls of the shop who snubbed her.",7,0,0,27 February 2011
Les Misérables," Do you hear the people sing?
","It has always been known by the famous stage musical which first came out in the 80s and it is still running since. Discerning fans will know that it began life as one of Victor Hugo's most well-known novels. Regardless how one first came to know Les Miserables, it has now made it to the silver screen.Especially for those who have watched the original stage musical and/or read the novel which first inspired it, there is a certain degree of expectation in terms of how it will translate to the big screen, considering there have been movie adaptations before, but without the singing. It is different this time, with the entire cast singing it 'live' as it progresses. A personal disclosure before the review: Yours truly actually first came to know about Les Miserables in its stage musical form learning to sing one of the songs from the musical 12 years ago in school, which the movie musical version certainly brought back memories. It was what happened 12 years ago where from there yours truly read the novel which formed the basis of the famous stage musical and now, the movie musical version.For those who have watched the original stage musical, the movie musical directed by Oscar-winning director Tom Hooper (first known for his work in The King's Speech) along with the crew who had played a part in the success of the original musical production by the likes of Cameron Mackintosh, Alain Boubil (who co-wrote the original French lyrics), Herbert Kertzmer (who wrote the English-language version of the lyrics), Claude-Michel Schonberg, it follows the original musical's storyline in its adaptation based on Victor Hugo's novel.For the uninitiated, set in post-French Revolution 19th century France, the story began in 1815 of ex-convict Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) who has been released on parole by Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe) after spending a 19-year sentence for stealing a loaf of bread for his sister's child before finding solitude in the Bishop of Digne (Colm Wilkinson) who pardoned him for stealing silver where eight years later, Valjean under the disguise of Monsieur Madeleine, has assumed on a different identity as factory owner and mayor in Montreuil-sur-Mer who is well-liked and respected by the locals. One of his factory workers Fantine (Anne Hathaway) would eventually be sacked for sending money to her illegitimate daughter Cosette (Isabelle Allen as young Cosette) who works at an inn the Thenardiers (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter) run. Fantine would become a prostitute in a desperate attempt to support Cosette, before being saved by Valjean (whom she only knows as Monsieur Mayor) after she was arrested by Javert for attacking an abusive man, who brought her to hospital. Valjean would reveal his real identity to the court after learning from Javert a man believed to be him was arrested, before arriving at the hospital to promise Fantine's dying wish of looking after Cosette. Valjean would escape from Javert again at the hospital before finding Cosette at the Thenardiers and paid them to allow him to take care of her and promising to be like a father and mother to her. It would be nine years later in 1832 where revolution was in the air after the death of the only government official sympathetic to the poor in General Jean Maximilien Lamarque with people like the student revolutionaries in Enjolras (Aaron Tveit), Marius Pontmercy (Eddie Redmayne) and street urchin Gavroche (Daniel Huttlestone) discussing plans for heading to the barricades on the same day of General Lamargue's funeral. In between talk of a revolution, Marius fell in love at first sight with Cosette (Amanda Seyfried), now a young woman.One cannot escape the goosebumps when it comes, and it did at various moments in the movie musical for yours truly. There were times it does coincide with the poignant scenes, like Hugh Jackman's Jean Valjean character after being pardoned by the Bishop of Digne with 'Valjean's Soliloquy' and questioning his own identity with 'Who Am I?' and the highly-publicised performance of Anne Hathaway when she sang 'I Dreamed A Dream'. Apart from those moments and the times yours truly actually nearly cried given of the level of the poignancy from different scenes, there is also the comic relief provided by the Thenardiers from especially Sascha Baron Cohen as the 'Master of the House', one of the songs he sang along with Helena Bonham Carter.With the memories of yours truly learning to sing Young Cosette's 'Castle On A Cloud' back in school in music class before learning the background story to the song and Les Miserables in general, there is a degree of expectation prior to watching the movie musical with all the more of what has been said about the movie musical in terms of how it was made. Yours truly have been disappointed by a past movie adaptation she once watched, and it has nothing to do with no singing was involved. While I am impressed by the fact that the cast of the movie musical has to sing their parts 'live' with especially Jackman and Hathaway in terms of what their roles demand of them in Jean Valjean and Fantine respectively, it is the camera angles which can be a put off, being a little too close for comfort at times.Other than that, despite never seen the full stage musical version before and more of depending on what I know of Les Miserables from the novel itself and what I have read about the stage musical, it still manages to do one of Victor Hugo's well-known novels justice and making it relevant for the modern audience once again.",8,0,1,16 January 2013
The Da Vinci Code," Watch it with an open mind. You will like it!
","As this movie has been touted as one of the most anticipated films of this year, certainly expectations are high. And it does not failed me at all. I had read the novel beforehand and so at least I know what to expect of the movie.The critics had been saying so much about this movie, it had actually made me kind of dread how the movie will turn out as I had read the book already and like it. Still, I went to the cinema with an open mind. And I realised, having the open mind really works. Yes, it's all just work of fiction and it's up to oneself to decide what is real and not. I am not a Christian myself but yet I like overall how it's presented. Also for someone who had read the book before, I do like that it stays with the book most of the time despite the time constrains with few minor changes here and there in the movie.The places being featured in the movie are just - fantastique! I like overall how the cast are being presented. Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon, Audrey Tautou as Sophie Neveu, Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing, Jean Reno as Bezu Fache, Paul Bettany as Silas...it really fit altogether.For my father who had accompanied me to go watch this, he had certainly asked me a lot of questions (and I patiently replied him back after the movie ended) about what the movie was trying to say. Still eventually, he had managed to get the gist of it. The pace of the movie is the reason why he and I managed to understand the whole thing. For me, it's better because I had read the book beforehand. I know I had said that many times but then for one who had not read the book, you will still more or less get the hang of it.The final few moments of the movie can really drive home why director Ron Howard had made this movie well. Even if I dare say I was not aware of the novel version beforehand, I think I will still be almost choked up towards the end of the movie.So much had been said about Dan Brown's bestselling novel and this movie adaptation but then I can only give this one advice for those who are going to go watch the movie - watch it with an open mind. It will surely do value to your movie ticket as it does to mine.",8,4,6,23 May 2006
Titanic," One of my all-time favourites. Yes.
","When I say that, I am not kidding anyone. Had I knew it earlier, I will have posted my review here beforehand. I had watched it once when it was at the cinemas here (and someone I know actually watched more than once!), watched twice or something when it was on the television here. The last time was like few years back on the television.It goes to show how much I so love the movie, despite some may think now it's cheesy to bring it up. Hey, this was a box office winner and it's still at the top here in terms of ticket earnings for an opening release of a movie, from what I know. And whenever I heard Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On', I will almost become a drama mama. Literally.Interstingly, I first remembered back then some years back in my school days, I was doing a comprehension passage about the cruise liner prior to the movie's release and the thing at that time, I had never thought much about the comprehension passage I did after that. I had never thought that it will become a big blockbuster of the time few years later it came out. Till I (even) begged my family that I wanted to go watch it at the cinema (which it happened). I know it's all fiction in the movie about the love story of Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack (Leonardo DiCapirio) before watching it.The entire movie setting is almost perfect and it will almost bring you back of the era when the actual cruise liner had its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York. Even as I was watching each time, I had often wished I am boarding a luxury cruise liner (still waiting for that day). Anyone can dream.I have to kind of admit, interestingly, I never cried (but just felt deeply moved then) towards the end of the movie when I first saw it but subsequently when it was on the television here, tears almost started to come out of my eyes.Almost a real perfect masterpiece. Just don't care what others will say.",9,3,5,19 June 2006
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," It's all about the magic!
","I will never, ever forgive myself (just kidding) if I never gave a review to this. Given though I only became a Potter fan after I watched this on DVD, I so know I have to do it.There must be something about this first instalment that it was actually being aired twice here on the television, with the latest like early last month. I watched it the first time when it was on the television. It really brought back the memories for me.Based on the best-selling debut novel from JK Rowling, it's about the adventures of Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) who realises that on his 11th birthday that he is actually a wizard from Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) who came to receive him. And a famous one, even when Harry was a year old. Thus, it became the beginning of his school life and various adventures at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Some of those people he met were like, the son of an old wizarding family- Ronald 'Ron' Weasley (Rupert Grint), the very smart witch who is actually of Muggle (non-magical people, in Potter-speak) parentage- Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), the one whom Harry soon knew will become one of those he will never always like- Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) and so on. It was because of a troll incident in the girls' toilet (yes, Harry and Ron went there to save Hermione) that Harry, Ron and Hermione became the best of friends since.Harry was also being discovered as being the youngest Seeker since a century ago as well. His 'popularity' grew. But, someone in the school does not seemed to like him at all like Malfoy. It's his Potions professor- Severus Snape (Alan Rickman). Harry, Ron and Hermione thought it was Snape who was being the bad guy in wanting to steal the sorcerer's stone.But it's someone else. Their Defense Against The Dark Arts Professor Quirrell (Ian Hart). They only found out very much later after Harry confronted Quirrell.Now, with me only being hooked on the Potter series after watching it like four years ago on the DVD, it was start of the endless magic in the series to come. Any Potter fans will surely love this!",8,0,1,18 June 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The average fan will like this.
","As I am a Harry Potter fan myself, the movie's opening last year was what I looked forward to. I had heard so much how the book's plot had to shrink in order to fit into the movie but then given the time constraints, there is no way out.The serious Potter fans will be complaining that so many things are left out but then, there's no choice at all. For an average fan like me, it's alright. The three tasks just get tougher and difficult as it goes along in the movie. The Yule Ball scene was another highlight too.Don't even get me started on the graveyard scene when Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) met Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes) in the graveyard. After Cedric (Robert Pattison) was murdered by the Dark Lord's servant, I almost noticed my eyes was beginning to swell. Innocent people are always the first victims.Ever since the whole Harry Potter movie series began, I had already pictured who is who in the books as to who they are in the movies. It's the same for this fourth instalment as well. I can really picture how the Dark Lord (aka Lord Voldermort) looks like (it's scary!), Cedric looks like given the description given in the book as him being handsome and all that. It had never failed me on that.Also - Growing pains, teenage hormones...so who says the people in the magical world will not face it too? It does as well and it can be comical at times watching it unfold in the movie. As me in the late teens at the moment, I so know how it's like.For any Harry Potter fans out there, especially the average ones like me, you will like it.",8,0,0,28 May 2006
A Beautiful Mind," Good and inspirational.
","I was never the one being cut out to be good in Mathematics. I admit, it was a little below average. But I ended up studying accountancy instead.But it never stopped me back then to watch the movie when it was shown on the television here back then like few years back or something. If I cannot be someone good in Mathematics, then watching the life of Nobel Prize winner John Forbes Nash Jr. is good enough for me.Russell Crowe plays the Nobel Prize winner in the movie. Though he (as in Russell's character) has schizophrenia (the real John Nash Jr. did contracted it), he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics (this is as a result of my own mini research). I am not clearly aware of the Game Theory though, but then I guessed I realised why Nash is a mathematical genius in his own right after watching the movie.The reason I am only starting to remember about this movie once again as one of those I once watched, was because of, The Da Vinci Code (I did saw that movie and read the novel beforehand). I know this sounds funny, but back then when I read about who is going to direct The Da Vinci Code, director Ron Howard was credited in directing the Academy Award-winning movie A Beautiful Mind. It was then it hit me that I had actually once watched one of Howard's earlier works.Back to this movie I am reviewing on. If someone like me who has never really able to succeed in her Mathematics do like this movie, I don't see why others will not like it too.",8,0,2,22 June 2006
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Second instalment works out well too.
","Prejudice starts to become the dominant theme in the second of the Potter series and it certainly does. Who is a pure blood, half-blood, or just Muggle-born? Coincidentally, Ron, Harry and Hermione come under each category respectively.Our three friends have returned for this second instalment of the popular series only to find themselves in their second year, that something really bad is going to happen in the school they all attend. With even this time Ron's youngest sister Ginny (Bonnie Wright) able to attend Hogwarts now, and even a maybe over-zealous Harry fan in the form of Ginny's classmate Colin Creevey (Hugh Mitchell), things are getting more complicated.Harry realised he can actually speak snake language, something only the descendants of one of Hogwarts' founders, Slytherin, can only achieve. Soon all the accusations that he is the Slyerin's heir (given he is in Gryffindor actually) started to come out. But his two friends and those who believed he is not the Slyterin's heir all stood by him.Things only get worse when students in the school are getting Petrified, and Hermione is one of them. Soon, Harry and Ron found out all the reasons behind all the sinister actions that has been going on in the school. And it's all up to Harry to save the day.Finally one can know how the young Tom Riddle (aka Lord Voldermort) looks like, from his memory. As he said that to Harry when they were in the Chamber of Secrets. Well, those who are aware of the instalment will know what happened in the end.Saw this on DVD as well actually and it once aired on the television here like days after the fourth movie came out in the cinemas. A nice time to refresh the memory and revisiting the old days. The second one does live up to the hype too.",8,1,3,18 June 2006
Love Actually," It's all about love!
","What is love, really? This movie is all about exploring the various aspects of love in our daily lives. From the prime minister, to the ordinary man on the street, it's always happening. I first watched this movie on cable here in my country some time back and so this is my review...It's kind of fun and interesting to see how the cast celebrate love in many different ways leading up to Christmas in London. Hugh Grant as the prime minister, it's kind of funny and cute. Rowan Atkinson's appearance also brought some laughs.Love between friends, lovers, couples, siblings...most of it were being dealt with in the movie. It just gives you the fuzzy feeling.The accompanying music in the movie is also quite good as well. Overall, if you are the kind who is searching for some movie to cozy up with the ones you love, this is the movie for you.",7,0,2,28 May 2006
The Lion King," Just what Disney fans will like.
","If my memory never fails me, I think I remembered that this was one of the earliest movies I ever watched at the cinema. Given I look at the year when it was released, I was about seven at that time actually.I mean, how can I remembered much as a kid at that time? I remembered it was my mother who asked what we want to see at the cinema. This was what we wanted to watch then.You know, a young girl at that time will always be fascinated with over the animation and the animals' voices in an Disney animation movie. I remembered at that time Samba was one of my favourite characters. From the time he was a cub to a lion, I just 'ooed' and 'awwed'.The accompanying song to it, Elton John's 'The Circle Of Life', I still remembered how the song goes actually. Now thinking again, it's quite fitting to the animated movie.Almost a near-Disney masterpiece.",9,0,0,19 June 2006
Bring It On," With spunk and moves.
","Torrance had been made the new cheerleading captain of the Torros. The cheerleading squad from Rancho Carne High School are five-time national championship winners.But she found out that being the captain is tough. Searching for a replacement after one of the members had to be sent for the hospital while being injured during practice...and also to realise that the choreographed routines that she had been doing all along were actually stolen from the Clovers, a hip-hop squad from another school by the Torros' former captain. Torrance had to act fast before the upcoming national championships.But while she was busy searching of ways to help salvage the squad, the Clovers' squad captain Isis has problems as well. Her squad do not have enough money to pay for their travelling expenses to the national championships.Both captains facing different set of problems, but only one squad can emerge as the winner when the big day arrives. Which side will have all the moves eventually? The cheerleading scenes in the movie certainly do bring up some memories of myself when for a period of time, I was also part of a cheerleading squad (which I eventually withdraw from it). Watching all the spunk and moves that the cheerleaders are showing, it does certainly make me admire how much hard work the girls (and the guys) had been putting in.",7,0,0,14 April 2007
The Queen," A reflection of the modern times.
","Many of us remembered the day when Diana, Princess of Wales, died. The woman who was being called 'the People's Princess' by the then-Britain Prime Minister Tony Blair. Her death had triggered quite a response in the UK and around the world. But how did royal family reacted? Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) had been elected as the new prime minister of the country, and he had created history by being the youngest in the 20th Century to be elected to 10 Downing Street. Months later into his term in office, something happened which would shook the world. The Princess of Wales had died in a car crash in Paris. Almost immediately, the entire nation was in grief and it was evident in the newspapers' reaction to the princess's death. But somehow, there was no word or statement from the royal family with the media wanting to know what they have to say of it.Chronicling the immediate seven days since the death of the People's Princess, The Queen goes behind how the Prime Minister managed to convince HM Elizabeth II on how to express her and the royal family's reactions to the death of the country's most popular monarch of our time. Royal protocol don't always work in modern times where people want instant reactions. A sad but true fact of the society of today.What stands out for me is how Michael Sheen portrays Tony Blair. He is almost like the real McCoy. Helen McCroy as Cherie, the wife of Tony...the likeness is almost there. Helen Mirren's portrayal of the Queen herself had me almost convinced for a while she is the real thing.",8,0,1,1 March 2008
Space Jam," Loony Tunes meets basketball...fun!
","I had so know about the Loony Tunes. I mean, Bugs Bunny and gang are among the ones which I grew up watching those cartoons which feature them.Add in NBA star Michael Jordan, and one gets a movie about a bunch of animated characters playing basketball. I remembered I saw this when my teacher showed it once in class. I forgot when was it, but it was some time back already.Winning over evil can be a little cliché at times, but who cares when this makes up those crazy Loony Tunes characters and Michael Jordan at the same time? Great for anyone who is young and young at heart.",8,2,2,16 July 2006
La Vie En Rose," The life of the 'soul of Paris'
","From the streets of Paris, to international fame. Her voice has been dubbed as the 'soul of Paris'. La Vie en Rose, which is also Edith Piaf's signature song, may have been mainly in French, but it is about the life and times of one of France's most famous singers, possibly the country's greatest cultural export in the modern era.The film began with the adult Edith Piaf (Marion Cotillard) collapsing on stage, before the audience is being treated to flashbacks of the singer's past starting with her childhood, before concentrating with the key moments in Edith Piaf's life interwoven as she was entering her final days. The first defining moment when she sang the French national anthem 'La Marseillaise' with raw emotions to passersby who were disinterested in what her father was performing, to how she got her first big break in Louis Leplée's (Gérard Depardieu) nightclub where he gave the diminutive Edith the stage name of Piaf after an informal audition. Leplée's death turned Piaf into a suspect, before she turned to cabaret with no success.Raymond Asso (Marc Barbé) would be the next person to help develop Piaf's career, apart from polishing up on her singing. With her 'great hands', she became a national sensation after overcoming bouts of stage fright to make her maiden music hall performance. Piaf would travel to New York City to perform for the American audience, and along the way, meeting fellow Frenchman and renowned boxer Marcel Cerdan.The determination of Piaf insisting on singing even if health was catching up on her at the age of 47 was what fascinated me. For her, the show must go on despite of her constant drinking. And just as she has said, she did performed at the Paris Olympia, singing the song which describes her life as she acknowledges it herself – Non, je ne regrette rien. Her life, her loves, and the drinking, all encapsulated into the film.For those who do not listen to chanson, Marion Cotillard has made it sound like it was Piaf who was really back on stage once more. There are times watching the film, I thought it was Edith Piaf acting in her own biopic.",7,1,2,13 September 2011
Amélie," Very simple but yet amusing movie.
","Like many at that time, I had heard so many great things about this movie. But given the rating for our cinemas here in my country then, I could not go and watch, even if I have a chance.It is also the first time I first learnt of Audrey Tautou before she is in The Da Vinci Code movie recently. But, way before the world knows about The Da Vinci Code like me, many are mesmerized by Amelie (Audrey Tautou), the main character. So I was thankful this was once shown on the television before here (few years back). Given I had always been kind of interested in the French culture at times, it's a good way to start.Audrey as Amelie...it is almost quite perfect for an actress like her. Showing some of the quirky things she does and the people she knew around her in Montmartre, it's just one of those kind of French movies one will like to expect. Not so sophisticated as we like to think.Maybe at that time as I was watching on the television I did not really understand at times in terms of some of the dialogue...but Audrey really lighted up the entire movie with her portrayal of the protagonist.Simple, fun and amusing.",8,1,5,30 June 2006
The Sixth Sense," It may freak you out, but worth a watch.
","One of the most famous movie lines in history - 'I see dead people', comes from this movie. I had always knew why when I first saw this like four years ago back at school (it was after our exams), I will get freaked out at times.Because, I am the sort who does at times believe that ghosts, may be lurking around us but we just don't know it. Call me superstitious, but then I had never did anything serious to believe that. It's just, me.Child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) realises that his young charge Cole (Haley Joel Osment) actually has the ability to see dead people. Thus that famous line in the movie.About every corner and turn, it's just suspenseful, and scary. It may actually really scare those who are not really into movies like this, but it's worth a watch. Just don't give yourself too much stress.",7,0,0,20 June 2006
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Ending with how I liked
","It brought me back to how it all started. To how I come to be a Harry Potter fan by reading the books as well after watching the first film. The theme music from the first film which was played when the credits rolled in was a reminder of the more innocent times, of how like many in the fandom, we have come to grow together with the characters. But there has to come a time where the series has to end.The film continues where it left off in the first part of the final instalment of the series, after the burial of the elf Doby. In what would become a theme for throughout the film until the aftermath of the grand battle of Hogwarts, the solemn marching of the Hogwarts students in the school compound before the start of the film would become the embodiment of how much the wizarding world has changed. Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his determination to search for the remaining Horcruxes apart from those which were already destroyed in the first part of the final instalment, and Lord Voldermort's (Ralph Finnes) ever-determination to finish Harry off by himself.After burying Doby, Harry Potter manages to convince Griphook (Warwick Davies) of breaking into Bellatrix Lestrange's vault at Gringotts after Griphook was convinced that he would get the sword of Gryffindor in return. Harry believes that a Horcrux lies in Bellatrix's vault, which would turn out to be Helga Hufflepuff's (who was one of the four Hogwarts founders) Cup. He then turned to Ollivander the wand maker, whom was also being rescued from Malfoy Manor from the first part of the final instalment, to identify the two wands that they took from there which Ollivander (John Hurt) later explained belonging to Bellatrix and Draco Malfoy, but Malfoy's wand has changed its allegiance.Using the Polyjuice Potion to disguise herself as Bellatrix with Ron being disguised as a random wizard and with Harry and Griphook who are under Harry's Invisibility Cloak, they managed to breach the security at Gringotts. They nearly did not get to Bellatrix's vault, but with the help of the Imperius Curse, they managed to get to the carts and onto the vault. After Harry managed to retrieve Hufflepuff's Cup, Griphook took the sword and turned his back on the trio, with the trio fled by jumping onto the back of the dragon which was guarding the vaults earlier. During the escape, Lord Voldermort manages to enter Harry's mind and has been learning that his Horcruxes have been discovered and destroyed. At the same time in the vision, Harry saw that the next Horcrux he needs to find and destroy is in Hogwarts itself and it belongs to another of Hogwarts founders in Rowena Ravenclaw.When the trio arrived at Hogsmade, they were nearly being found out. But it was the owner in Abeforth Dumbledore (Ciarán Hinds), who is the younger brother of the late Albus Dumbledore, saved them. He had seemed to lose all hope in fighting Lord Voldermort, but Harry manages to change Abeforth's mind in letting them reaching Hogwarts so that they may be able to find the Horcrux. Abeforth instructed the portrait of his younger sister Ariana (Hebe Beardsall) to find Neville Longbottom who leads the trio back to Hogwarts. But Harry's Hogwarts return would eventually be found out by the new Hogwarts Headmaster in Severus Snape (Alan Rickman).For those who have stuck with Harry and his friends since the very beginning (that means people like me), there are reminders of the past in the second part of the final instalment. The most evident is Hogwarts itself. It is a time when the wizarding world knows where their loyalty lies in the Battle of Hogwarts, a time when Neville Longbottom has really come onto his own. But even despite the gloomy theme which happens throughout most of the film which was expected, there are still spaces of moments which stand out for me. Harry's confrontation with Snape at the Great Hall, the duel between Professor Minerva McGonagall (Maggie Smith) and Snape, and probably the most heart-warming moment for me came during when Harry was looking at Snape's memories in the Pensieve, (the untold story of) Snape's unrequited love for Harry's mother Lily which was shown especially after she sacrificed herself to save her then-one-year-old son.A fitting ending to the series, bringing an end to which the neutrals should like where the good triumphs over evil. Even if I don't review it as a Harry Potter fan who first got onto the fandom after watching the first film, it is an ending which I still do like.",8,0,2,16 July 2011
Minions," The early days of the Minions
","When do the minions really began their place in history? Definitely longer than the human species. Ever since the beginning of time, minions have always wanted to serve the baddest, meanest villain around. Over centuries through history, they have come to find serving humans is what they find most enjoyable.But it was during the time of Napoleon, things did not go quite as planned, and the minions were driven into isolation and started a new life in the Antarctica. The minions would come to grow restless over the years with no purpose in life, but it was to be one minion Kevin who decided to do something. He would be joined by the musically-inclined Minion Stuart who had no idea what he was joining in for, and the young and inexperienced Bob, and the trio would come to find their journey take them to 1968's New York City.After trying to blend into their new surroundings, the trio came to find themselves at a departmental store and spent the night there. They would come across a television advertisement advertising Villain- Con, a convention for villains and supervillains in Orlando. That got them eventually hitchhiking a ride with a family of villains called the Nelsons who were also heading there, and the Nelsons were to be impressed at their skills. At the Villain-Con, the Minions would come to meet the first female supervillain Scarlett Overkill (Sandra Bullock) and they did enough to impress her, leading Scarlett to send them over to England with her, where the Minions would also come to meet her husband Herb (Jon Hamm).It was in England where the Minions came to know what they needed to do. Scarlett came to tell the Minions of the plan to steal the Queen's crown jewels, and gave them the tools needed to be successful in their heist. But what the Minions came to attempt to do would soon be heavily publicised, and the whole of Britain would come to be heavily destabilised for a few days.While much like the two Despicable Me films, the comedic elements were there with the Minions around, but at the same time, the Minions could not quite hold it in their very own film of how they would come to find their eventual owner. Still, what made this enjoyable like the human characters in Scarlett and Herb. But it definitely takes the viewers on a journey of how the Minions came to settle for the owner we would see in the two Despicable Me films.",6,0,0,6 January 2016

Slumdog Millionaire," Feel-good as you can get
","What do you get when you have an underdog story, the essence of India, a gameshow which has gripped a country? It would come to be British film director Danny Boyle's Oscar-winning film of 2009 of Slumdog Millionaire, based on Indian novelist Vikas Swarup's Q&A.It tells the story of 18-year-old Jamal (Dev Patel), the former street child now working as a tea server at a call centre being on the Indian version of 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?'. Just as he was one question away from the big prize where his incredible run has captured the nation's imagination, he was being suspected of cheating. On the basis of how a 'slumdog' knows the answers on the gameshow.As the gameshow progresses, we are being treated to flashbacks of Jamal's life which corresponds to where every step of the way on the gameshow, where each round provided a clue as to how he knows the answers which he constantly stuns the jealous host Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor) who had even tried to frame him in the penultimate round. Along the way, the flashbacks also included his brother Salim and the person he has considered to be the 'third musketeer' Latika who comes from the same slum as him and his brother, based on the famed Alexandre Dumas novel of 'The Three Musketeers'. And the various adventures the trio had after they escaped from gangster Maman (Ankur Vikal).One of the reasons why this is a feel-good film for me because one cannot help but along the way, rooting for Jamal to succeed. Only cynics does not like an underdog story, where the main character overcomes all odds to come up tops at the end of the day. Not only that, Patel's character who comes from the slums before he would be a tea server at a call centre shows not only the unglamorous sight of India via the slums, and what the world knows about India through what happened in the final scene in terms of what Bollywood has presented to the world. And the final reason is partly biased on my part because the fact that it also uses the element of the gameshow 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire' brought me back to the days when I was a big fan of the gameshow when it was still very popular a decade or so ago.A recommended film for some feel-good factor, especially if one needs a pick-me-up.",8,1,5,4 July 2011
The Great Gatsby," Searching for the elusive green light
","It has always being considered as the 'Great American Novel', and considered unfilmable at the same time. Such is the veneration for the novel meant that there is always a great deal of responsibility to whoever is adapting it on screen, and Australian film director Baz Luhrmann's take on an American classic is the sixth attempt, since the days of the silent film era.The plot is known to generations of readers who have read the novel. But it is the opening scene which may have some taken aback on how narrator Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) tried to recall the events taking place in the summer of 1922 on Long Island and New York especially on Long Island's West Egg where he and his mysterious wealthy neighbour Jay Gatsby (Leonardo diCapiro) had lived. Carraway had initially no idea whether anyone would want to read on the events which took place in that particular summer which had quite an impact on his life, but his doctor at the sanitarium where Carraway was at encouraged him to do so.Thus Carraway let his writings do the talking on what happened three years before, which began with him talking about the America he knew at that time as he began his career as a bond trader in New York, his home on West Egg and living next door to Gatsby, along with the visit to the Buchanan mansion opposite the lake on East Egg where he will meet his cousin Daisy (Carey Mulligan), cousin-in-law Tom (Joel Edgerton) whom he knew from their time at Yale and Daisy's childhood friend and golfer Jordan Baker (Elizabeth Debicki) where they will all have dinner together. Before the conversation flowed at dinner, Jordan had remarked about a party she had attended at Gatsby's mansion, leading to Daisy wondering whom her childhood friend was talking about.But little did the narrator Carraway realised that the man who is his mysterious neighbour does also have a relationship with his cousin. It would only be after he had been invited to the party, and the only one being invited where everyone else just found their way to Gatsby's mansion with people of all sorts, he began to slowly unravel through the glitz and glamour of the parties his neighbour Gatsby had threw consistently on weekends after both men were reunited since both served in the same unit on the front during the war, that he began to learn of the man behind the parties, and from Gatsby's Jewish friend Meyer Wolfsheim (Amitabh Bachchan). At the same time, learning about Gatsby's connection to his cousin Daisy with also Jordan acting as the go-between as she recounted the day when she first saw Gatsby and the tensions leading up to Daisy's wedding to Tom Buchanan.That is not the only thing which had a profound impact on Carraway in that particular summer. There is also the affair between his cousin-in-law Tom and his mistress Myrtle Wilson (Isla Fisher), whom Tom first met at the garage ran by Myrtle's husband George (Jason Clarke) at the Valley of Ashes, and the people Tom and Myrtle know in New York whom he met including Myrtle's older sister Catherine (Adelaide Clemens).Things start to go a little awry at the Gatsby mansion after Daisy and Gatsby were reunited, leading to all sorts of questions being asked in the newspapers over the origins of Gatsby's enormous wealth, which is also something Daisy's husband Tom started to get a little suspicious over apart from wondering how and when his wife first met Gatsby. The chain of events leading to the final fate of his neighbour and friend Gatsby would lead to Carraway becoming a changed man on how he look at the America he once knew.Much has been debated over the fusing of hip-hop into a film which is set in the 1920s where it also known as the 'Jazz Age', but it is also bringing it to a modern audience with a contemporary relevance apart from how people in that period would interpret jazz as how Lhurmann saw it. Other than that, one would probably a sense of déjà vu over the film's plot and how it mirrors the America the narrator Carraway saw, and the constant reference to the green light as seen from the dock of the Buchanan mansion and how that fitted into the whole narrative.Still, it is the spirit of the novel being reflected on screen which had stayed true for very much throughout. It is the story which still has its current relevance.",7,0,2,30 May 2013
All the President's Men," The story behind the story
","It is a story which the final outcome is a well-known fact. The case of the 37th President of the United States in Richard Nixon resigning from his post, before Nixon's former vice-president Gerald Ford took over. It is the story of Watergate, and the two Washington Post reporters who will come to be known for their reports. It is based on the book of the same name written by the two reporters from the Washington Post at the time of Watergate in Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who would come to uncover what, would lead to the eventual resignation of Nixon.It is June 1972. There was a break-in at the Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate complex. The young Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward (Robert Redford) was assigned to cover the story at the courthouse and began to establish the identities and the backgrounds of the five who were caught in the break-in. It would lead him to conclude the five were being connected with E. Howard Hunt, a former CIA employee and Charles Colson, the special counsel to the president Richard Nixon. As the break-in would become more than just how it looked on the surface and took on a more political twist to it, Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) would come to be assigned to the story as well, along with the colleague he only knew briefly before in Woodward.Woodward and Bernstein went from being reluctant partners to collaborating well together, following up on the two men (Hunt and Colson) in connection with the five burglars. The Post's executive editor Ben Bradlee (Jason Robards) was not convinced what Woodward and Bernstein had uncovered so far to be deemed worthy of being on the front page, and encouraged them to uncover more information. Among the sources who were willing to talk to the duo assigned to cover the story apart from those who refused to divulge details or slammed them or the Post in various ways all coming at a time when Nixon would be undergoing a re-election campaign and was guaranteed to beat his Democratic opponent George McGovern, there is an anonymous source whom Woodward had used before and trusted who goes by the codename of Deep Throat (Hal Holbrook).As it shows throughout the course of the film, which was released two years after the resignation of Nixon and the publication of the book which formed the basis of the film of the same name, there is nothing glamorous in terms of the process Woodward and Bernstein went through before getting their reports to be on the Post. Doors getting slammed in their faces, the doubts from the various Post editors on the sources Woodward and Bernstein had used in their reports including Deep Throat.Watching the film, it is also a reminder of the press at its best. Watch it as a reminder of a time of how it was in Woodward and Bernstein's day. It is a film for fans of American politics and contemporary American history, those who like a little sense of adventure and suspense in films, and definitely recommended for students of media and aspiring journalists.",8,1,1,29 November 2012
