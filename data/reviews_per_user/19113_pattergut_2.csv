Blade Runner 2049," A flawed masterpiece.
","Blade Runner 2049 is a fantastic movie filled with brilliant performances great characters, near perfect cinematography that make up for the sub-par story and writing. 
It's exiting to see that there are still filmmakers that have both a unique style and the bravery to do something different. While Dennis Villeneuve doesn't have the most distinctive style, he still is one of the best directors working right now, making unique and interesting films that are pushed forward by stellar performances, and 2049 is no different. What Villeneuve does with the world of Blade Runner is expand the scope, and this pays off amazingly. The original Blade Runner (based on Philip K. Dick's book) is a movie that is flawed but still good, having an amazing production value and a world that feels realistic yet is brought down by a mediocre story and a bland main character. 2049 takes this elements and makes the better in almost every way, introducing a new main character that is both complex and interesting. Yet 2049 still has a pretty mediocre story, having a sub-plot at the end that has no real pay-off and some voice over that is there to spell things out for viewers even though it's pretty clear to begin with.
The movie has some cool symbolism with the character of Luv.
The movie also has what I consider to be, Harrison Ford's best performance yet, considering how mediocre he was in The force awakens.

Ready Player One," Dull, boring and overall bad.
","With stilted dialogue, bad acting, a predictable plot and sub-par special effects, Ready Player One feels like another bland, boring action movie like Black Panther, yet the movie somehow manages to be worse. It's lead character is painfully bland and uninspired just like everyone else in the movie. The dialogue is stilted at best and cringeworthy at its worst. The only redeemable quality of this movie is the concept of the oasis, but somehow the movie manages to mess that up to, leaving the first 15 or so minutes of the movie to explain the viewer its history and purpose, yet the world doesn't feel real at all, the characters visit 5 or so locations in the oasis, making it feel small instad of the huge universe that it should be. The performances are either terrible or mediocre, even Simon Pegg manages to be mediocre. Every character (with one exception) is one dimensional and bland, especially the main lead and the antagonist who have no motivations for anything they do and are extremely unlikeable and un-relatable. Overall Ready Player One is a boring, dull action movie, with little redeeming qualities and a predictable plot. 2/10",2,104,216,4 April 2018
