Requiem for a Dream," Absolutely incredible
","I just finished watching Requiem For A Dream, and I'm typing this right now so I won't miss any details, although I'm sure I will. I feel completely drained, physically as well as emotional. This film has sucked the will to live straight from my body. Its a depressing story, more depressing than any other movie I have ever seen. However, it is also a very powerful film. Believe me, I will NEVER do drugs, take pills, etc. The main cast of four are all amazing. Some of the best acting I've ever seen happened in this movie. The big star here: Ellen Burstyn. She plays the mother of one of the characters, but its not your average mother figure. She delves into true insanity in this role. Not insanity, like the funny stuff in most movies, but actual, REAL insanity. This is a performance by which all others should be judged. I've never seen Jared Leto before, but he is also incredible in his role. Everyone in this movie spirals downwards over the scope of the film. There are no heroes here. The standard plot arcs are flipped upside down, and the only winner is each character's addiction. There are truly no winners. But enough about the plot. The film-making is also absolutely incredible. All the flash shots, rapid fire camera changes, sounds, etc. There is intense film-making vision and skill here. The best scenes are those in which drugs are being used, with rapid-fire camera views of the drugs, the person, the drugs entering the bloodstream, the person's eye dilating, etc. They are impossible to describe using mere words, so I will not attempt to. However, they are incredible. Everyone who is considering trying hard drugs, please watch this film first. What begins as an easygoing having fun and doing drugs movie shows what happens in real life with its massive downward spiral. This is the harsh reality that surrounds drug use. Finally there is a film merging really cool film-making with harsh reality. This is an absolute must-see for everyone. I will NEVER forget this film, and I will never forget the characters. I will never think about druggies the same, I will never think about prostitutes the same, I will never think about old widows the same. This movie has changed my entire perspective on life. Stop reading this s****y review and just watch the film.",10,0,1,20 June 2004
