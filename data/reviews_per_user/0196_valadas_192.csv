The King's Speech," A common man after all
","But one with special responsibilities. This movie about the drama of King George VI because of his severe stammer and the fact that due to his position first as a prince and later as a king, this is a great problem, may be considered by republicans as dealing with something not worth of great interest or value since they abhor and despise monarchy and monarchist institutions. But we must see this as the true historical fact that had political impact not only in the UK but even in Europe or the world. The voice limitation of the Chief of State of a great European power in such critical times as the Thirties of last century was, with the ascension of Nazism putting a dark cloud over Europe and the world, a theme worth a movie or any other artistic or literary work. And this movie tells us this dramatic story in a very effective and realistic way with all performers doing an excellent job. The movie direction was a solid one, recreating very well the British palatial atmosphere of those times and showing us very expressively the sometimes tumultuous relationship between the stammering prince and his very peculiar speech therapist. Not exactly a masterpiece since the theme doesn't allow such ecstasy but a good film anyway, one of the best we have seen this year.",7,0,0,13 March 2011
Moneyball," Great Performance
","If you like baseball you will love this movie. But you don't know or don't like it you will appreciate this movie all the same because it is a well told and filmic epic story. The meanders of baseball are complicated. The evaluations, the contracts, the plans and the philosophy of the game are complex indeed. Brad Pitt has a marvellous performance as general manager of the Oakland AAs club and team and along the movie he makes us greatly feel the suspense and drama of building a victorious team out of the usually admitted parameters.
This story, though romanced, is based in actual events and is psychologically fascinating. Of course you need to know and understand a bit of baseball to appreciate it. I don't know almost anything abput baseball but apreciated the movie in spite of that.",7,1,1,7 November 2018
The Avengers," Splendid
","And remarkably brilliant. The action is dazzling the whole movie through. And the story escapes somehow to the usual plot of this kind of movies. All goes around the Tesseract, an energy source and who has got it or is trying to. Loki an exiled Norse god takes it and tries to use it to control or even destroy Earth with the help of and extra-terrestrial army of evil soldiers. The only solution S,H.I.E.L.D. (an agency aiming at Earth protection) envisages is to put together a team of legendary heroes to fight that threat. But these heroes (Captain America, The Incredible Hulk, Thor and The Iron Man) are not exactly at the beginning very friendly to each other so their conflicts must be first appeased before they enter in action as The Avengers to fight Earth's enemy. Then the action develops itself in overwhelming fights, collective and individual of astonishing and appalling quality until the final defeat of the bad ones. Chiefly the final scenes are excellent indeed. This is one of the best movies of this kind ever made.",7,0,3,30 November 2016
Blade Runner 2049," Replicants
","Many of them. Replicants are copies of human beings who can behave like humans do and also feel and suffer like them. Well if you like science-fi you'll love this movie but if you don't I don't advise you to watch it. A complicated story that tells also about the conflict between replicants and humans who are their bosses and to whom they must obey totally. The story is a about young blade runner (a replicant) who is a detective of LAPD and who is ordered to kill one of the old replicants whose models must be retired. During that task he finds a box buried under a tree and there begins his engagement in solving the mystery contained in the box which includes a disappeared child of a replicant woman which adds more mystery to the plot since replicant women cannot be pregnant. From there on a lot of violent episodes develop themselves involving humans, replicants and virtual creatures who can transfigure themselves and merge into others. The visual effects are terrific and excellent and that is perhaps the main motive to go watch this movie.",7,0,3,9 October 2017
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Sentimental violence
","Well first you must take for granted that The Bride (Uma Thurman) is a superwoman that can survive injuries that would kill the strongest mortal in this earth. This second part has a much less poetic atmosphere than the first one and less ballet-like fighting scenes and dwells more upon the psychological displays of the characters which culminate in the final scenes where sentiment and emotion prevail over violence though the latter is always present more or less intensely. In this movie you'll find the full explanation of what looked like a flaw of the first movie: the motive behind the killing of all the people at the wedding rehearsal and a quite plausible one. Well these killers may have sentiments too, who knows? Negative or positive of course. Anyway the love-hate relationship that exists between the two main characters is depicted with real strength and a certain contained emotion well displayed by Thurman and Carradine, emotion that explodes in the very last scene played by Thurman. It's a good movie of its kind (of course) after all.",7,0,1,12 May 2004
First Man," Exciting and thrillling
","And even hallucinating. Technically an excelent movie. We viewers feel sometimes that we are also in the space capsules suffering all those swings and rockings. This is the story of Neil Armstrong the first man who put his foot on the moon. We can also realize that astronauts have also private lives, a wife and kids. In this case Armstrongs' wife is not very happy with her husband's space tasks being always afraid that it could turn out badly. But this movie is rather good and the technical details of the space flights are realistic indeed and almost documentary like.",7,0,1,22 October 2018
Vertigo," Too fanciful to be credible
","I never was a Hitchcock fan and this review must be read in this light. I always thought that his films always created an intricacy of situations smelling of false that are suddenly disentangled in the end through an easy and doubtful solution. This movie is one more instance of this with a story full of gaps and snares, unreal and illogical in what concerns not only facts but also the psychological behaviour of the characters. In the end he concocts a rather dramatic final through the disclosure of the true story that was hidden behind the one that was being told us till then, in a rather superficial way This movie has not even at least the suspense or the thrill of some of his other movies like 'Psycho' or 'North by Northwest' for instance. It has several flaws and illogical or unexplained situations like for instance: a)- The plan to kill one's wife is too complicated involving a ghost story and the hiring of a double and a detective through a series of too artificial scenes; there is most surely a much easier and credible way to kill one's wife without being suspected of it. b)- It's unbelievable that when the detective meets for the first time after his friend's wife death the woman who lives in the hotel room that was supposedly used by the former, he couldn't recognize at once the woman he was in love with despite the different hair-do and make-up. c)- When the detective goes to that hotel for the first time trying to meet whom he then thought it was his friend's wife after having seen her through the window and it turns out that she isn't there after all, is the hotel lady manager also an accomplice in the plot when she says the other woman has not been there? And so on and so on. To declare this movie as the best movie ever made like a panel of distinguished critics recently did, is not only a huge falsehood but also an insult to tens of excellent films, hundreds of very good ones and even the thousands of those simply good.",5,9,18,20 September 2012
The New World," Only love is real
","Q'Orianka Kilcher in the role of the young Indian Princess Pocahontas 'is' the movie. From the first to the last image she captivates us with her presence, her smile, her pure and sweet look, her words and last but not least her deep inner thoughts that we hear through her off voice. All the other characters are mere counterpoints of her acting which deeply fulfills our sight and our hearts and minds. I don't care if the movie respects truly the biography of Pocahontas which is itself full of less clear aspects as far as you know nowadays. Artistic freedom allows some creative liberties in that field providing they don't adulterate the essential truth which this movie doesn't. Besides the main theme which is the princess herself and her love story with a British captain, we are allowed to watch enough of the clash between the world of the British soldiers and settlers and the Indians living and owning that part of the New World of which they finished by being dispossessed violently as we all know. One final note that is also a key to understand this movie better: Captain Smith in the end admits that after all the true reality was made up by the love hours he had spent with Pocahontas in the forest in the beginning of the movie and nothing else. Love scenes shown here in very chaste images (we hardly see a lips to lips kiss) sparing us the sight of breasts and other anatomic delicacies which sometimes don't add anything to the meaning of the scenes and are totally gratuitous.",7,1,3,28 June 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Kazakh who?
","We must begin by saying that this movie's director was surely never in Kazakhstan nor has he ever seen a Kazakh in his life. The character impersonated by Sacha Baron Cohen shows only the stereotype that Americans imagine when they think about Mediterranean popular characters, from his physical appearance to his way of talking and behaviour. This movie is only a succession of gags of which a few are funny indeed but whose majority is not funny at all and sometimes even disgusting. The story of the Kazakh journalist who went to USA to learn about American way of life is poor indeed. The best parts of the movie are those episodes where some idiosyncrasies of American society are shown like for instance a religious meeting near the end of the movie and the behaviour of white and black young people. But even those are almost only commonplaces we have seen much better treated in lots of other movies. This movie is a real disillusion.",6,1,7,10 January 2007
The Monuments Men," Terrific team
","Not exactly a masterpiece but a movie worth to be seen anyway. It's the story of a team charged to rescue works of art namely masterpieces stolen by the Nazis from museums, churches and private owners (mainly Jews) at the end of World War II when their defeated army was retiring from occupied countries (France and Belgium) chased by the Allies. The story is told in a pleasant visual terms and with an excellent performing of all actors in a good vivid rhythm and in a very well rebuild sceneries and atmosphere of locals and action of that time. The rescue team acts very courageously and with great comradeship among them. The story is totally credible despite several odd and dangerous situations in which the rescue team gets involved also because sometimes they lack support from the American army for their actions. It's lively and active and it's said that it's based on true real events. The vexed question it poses is that if the rescue of an art masterpiece is worth the loss of a human life since the rescuers incur in real life dangers.",7,1,2,11 March 2014
3:10 to Yuma," With a little more this could be a good movie
","For those who saw the 1957 version of this same story by Delmer Daves the difference is clear. A dramatic plot described in much simpler scenes but full of intensity now changed into one more western movie with the usual clichés: shootings and killings galore, attacks, horse riding, suspense and even Indians. Not altogether bad anyway since the acting is good, the most thrilling scenes are well built and the suspense not exaggerated. But it has got the usual unlikelihoods in western movies in terms of facts such as for instance the almost miraculous deeds in those shootings that defy the laws of aiming with small hand firearms as anyone who has ever fired these guns too well knows. Besides that this movie has a rather inconclusive end on the contrary of the Delmer Daves' version in which the end is meaningful and clear although surprising. In both movies the story is the same though treated in different ways: an outlaw is captured and must be taken forcibly to another town (Yuma) in the train that leaves at 3.10 to be imprisoned, tried and eventually hanged there while the outlaw's gang is trying to rescue him at all costs. If I remember rightly in the first movie the outlaw is captured and led all he time by one man only, a sheriff or Marshal of another town, while in this movie he is escorted by a small group of men though in the end it's only one that tries to lead him to the train facing a lot of obstacles due to the fierce opposition of the gang. It's a movie you can see with a certain pleasure but not exactly what you might call a good movie.",6,0,0,3 March 2012
Ali," Almost only box
","This could be the story of Cassius Clay aka Muhammad Ali the fighter for Afro-Americans rights. But it turns out to stay almost only as the story of the world heavyweight boxing champion with a few references now and then to his political activity and positions and only through some utterances of his and never through any actions. The movie even ignores all of his life after 1974 (the year when he won the world title again in Zaire) despite the fact that his political and social actions went on. Therefore as a movie about boxing it's a passable one and will certainly be most appreciated by boxing fans but it has enormous gaps in what concerns the personality of Ali mainly in his political,social and religious aspects particularly those which resulted from his early conversion to Islamism. In biographic terms this movie is therefore a disappointment.",6,0,1,11 June 2012
Source Code," Stupid story although entertaining movie
","Yes we keep ourselves entertained while we watch that stupid story of an air force captain being used without being asked on a mission to discover a terrorist and thus avoiding a further large attack after a train explosion that killed all passengers that the terrorrist has carried out through a cell phone. The plot is rather silly and develops iself hrough a lot of repeated scenes in created alternate times while our hero is trying unsuccesfully to find the terrorist
A poor imaginative screenplay.",5,0,2,24 July 2019
Skyfall," Fabulous and fantastic
","We must forgive a few plot unlikelihoods, inconsistencies and not very well explained developments for the sake of the greatness of the visual features and aspects of this movie. The action scenes are fabulous and terrific, the camera movements, the cut and the images framing are excellent and the special and miniature effects overwhelming. Last but not least we have the splendid performance of a luxurious cast composed beside Daniel Craig as James Bond, by such great performers like Judi Dench, Ralph Fiennes, Javier Bardem and even the old veteran Albert Finney in a small part in the end. The story is about the theft by a terrorist group led by and ex-agent of MI6 of a computer drive with the identities of other agents and that must be retrieved by 007 at all costs since some of them are anonymously infiltrated in terrorist networks. The action is constant and takes place from Istanbul to the Scotttish Highlands passing through London, Shanghai and Macao. The chases are overpowering indeed. The movie opens with perhaps the most fantastic and fabulous chase I have ever seen on a movie including cars, motorcycles and even a train running in tunnels from time to time. And the plot has even (which is rare in this kind of movies) some moving personal sentimental aspects mainly in the last scenes.",7,3,11,27 November 2012
Catch Me If You Can," Not too exciting
","A kid with special talent for cheating and swindling takes it as a way of life after the shock he feels with his parents' divorce. After that there is a succession of forgeries and impersonations some of them a bit unbelievable that take place in a not too exciting development. The kid is not a bad guy after all and has a lot of chances to show his good sentiments. He almost always behaves nicely. The affection developed between chaser and chased (maybe the most important feature of the movie) is not deeply explored. Well the story is a bit lukewarm and makes you sometimes think how is it possible that the kid has not been caught on several occasions. We only believe it due to to the great individual freedom and personal mobility that exist (and existed already in the sixties when the story takes place) in USA with the possibility of people changing their names all the time if they want to, etc.. I think in most European countries that kid would be caught very soon with our much more tight personal controls, mandatory identity cards, etc.. Concerning the acting, Di Caprio is equal to himself as we know him and in my opinion Tom Hanks' real talent is waisted in this movie. By the way a curious note: FBI agents are not shown here as the usual supermen and heroes but many of them as somewhat poor guys and not very bright. Well just a tolerable movie no more than that.",6,0,2,12 March 2003
Minority Report," If you take it for granted...
","As everybody knows the best way to prevent crime is to eliminate its social roots on the one hand and to educate individuals not to commit them on the other hand. Well but somewhere in the future someone in USA has discovered that the best way to do it is by foreseeing crimes to be committed and arrest their perpetrators before they commit them using for that purpose a trio of overgifted youngsters with powers to predict the future who are preserved like sardines in some kind of fluid. If you take this for granted you may enjoy and appreciate this movie a lot since it's made with the usual skilfulness Spielberg puts in everything he makes. It has substantial amounts of the usual ingredients: suspense, mystery, humanity, righteousness, good feelings, love, adventure and even small quantities of good humour all very well combined. And of course those special computer effects without which it seems no movie can be made these days. But if you are one of those so called bores who insist that a movie like any work of art must have some message to deliver which has to do with real men and women in real situations dealing with real problems of life that's Ok then go to your video club and fetch yourself a good classical movie and enjoy it comfortably at home. Oh anyway don't lose the final message of the movie. It's positive after all.",7,0,0,13 October 2002
A Star Is Born," Do you love rock music?
","Because if you do you will love this movie. Otherwise it is better that you avoid it.
A story of an alcoholic musician that helps a young singer fo become a star (Lady Gaga). Besides this there is a sometimes quarrelsome love relationship between them. When he is drunk things turn out badly. When he is sober he is a fine lover indeed. But she is deeply in love with him and that helps a lot. Technically this movie follows the modern cut that consists in quick series of plans, images and sequences with sudden and abrupt interruptions sometimes with the sound of one image still staying in the following one. Well, not bad at all after all.",6,1,3,17 October 2018
Gravity," Dreadful and wonderful
","Through a succession of terrific adventures and incidents after an accident in outer space we follow two astronauts, a man and a woman fighting against adverse conditions resulting of the total absence of gravity in which they move most of the time in open space, floating and sometimes drifting helpless at random The appalling visual scenes are filmed with great mastery and the performers do a great job with special mention of Sandra Bullock. The visual effects are of excellent technical quality. This movie has practically no story or plot since its main theme is made of the astonishing rhythm of dreadful and wonderful scenes that make the viewer to hold his breath most of the time. This is the more important aspect of the movie and makes it worth to be seen. Of course we must take for granted the unlikelihood of a few scenes like it is usual in this kind of movies",7,4,7,26 October 2013
The Big Lebowski," Under bowling spell
","That game in which you throw a huge ball at an arrangement of wooden pins trying to pull them all down and stay suffering the suspense of watching the ball trajectory along the alley till the end (in slow motion camera is much more thrilling) where it can pull them all down or fail some or most of them showing that at bowling like in life you are a loser. This movie strikes a certain parallel between bowling and real life, being the story of the misadventures of Jeffrey Lebowski (and Jeff Bridges performs a good role at it) caused by the fact that he has got the same name as a famous wealthy man which gets him into a lot of trouble narrated in a series of tragicomic episodes along with his two bowling pals one of them pretending to be a very smart guy but who only brings more trouble to our Lebowski man. Some of these episodes are funny indeed and are the best part of the movie since the story itself isn't worth much. Some others are not so funny including the one of an unnecessary death because death is rarely funny. The dialogues could be funnier if they didn't abuse of a well-known obscene four letter word which is repeated about three times in every five word sentence. I am no moralist at all but never could find any humour or aesthetic value in four letter words. I neither condemn nor approve of them; they just don't make me vibrate at all leaving me totally indifferent. They are only necessary in a work of art when they serve the purpose of defining someone's character. Is that the case here? In conclusion we can say that it's a lukewarm comedy lacking vibration.",5,1,3,5 July 2007
Unbreakable," Meaningless and inconclusive
","The shoemaker mustn't go beyond the slipper (old Portuguese proverb)and M. Night Shyamalan seems to be totally incapable of making a valid movie based on the top ideas behind this one. It would require the talent and genius of a Carpenter or a Kubrick. Moreover a thriller is supposed to thrill and this story of a man who cannot be physically hurt or wounded due to a supernatural power while another man in the opposite extreme of the human life spectrum is called Mr. Glass because his bones are so weak that they get broken by the least blow, is told in a dull and monotonous way of mostly inconclusive and almost meaningless images, scenes and sequences which aren't fit to thrill anyone. Near the end the movie seems to stir a little more but it ends inconclusively and meaninglessly once more. The attempt of connecting the story to the universe of comics is not convincing or understandable. In short, this movie is a failure though maybe original in terms of ideas which are not bad in terms of fiction and could be better developed by another director with the capacity and skill to feel their depth and put it out in convincing images and scenes.",6,0,0,19 February 2001
Monster," The Human Soul is an Abyss
","So the great Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa wrote in one of his poems. And this is true. Besides that the society where we live now creates these monsters like this movie clearly shows. Two young women (one of them much younger than the other) coming from quite opposite social and living poles meet one another by chance, fell in love with one another and start a tragic life together. The eldest had thrown herself into prostitution at the age of 13 after (like she herself tells at a given moment) having been continuously raped by a friend of her father. After having killed a client in self-defence, she takes hold of his gun and becomes a serial killer in part because she needs the money she takes from the victims after killing them, to support herself and her girlfriend but also because she hates them and herself and the life she leads. In the abyss of her soul good and evil live side by side and weave tragically together. On the good side there is also still the love she maintains by her companion who is a fragile person and much weaker than her and raising a few problems to her. Both characters are well depicted psychologically in words, manners and behaviour though Charlise Theron (Aileen the prostitute) has maybe too many facial and corporal ticks and twitches but maybe also the real woman (this is supposed to be a veracious story) was also like that. Anyway the performance of both actresses is good enough though not particularly brilliant. Summing it up although this is not exactly a masterpiece (even because the story is simple enough) but certainly a rather good movie.",7,0,1,13 January 2012
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Epic movie
",And full of action. This movie is neither worse nor better than all the others of this kind. Of course to be able to understand fully the story and the plot you should have seen all the other movies of the Star Wars series which I haven't. I have understood this is about the prolonged war between the Empire and the Rebellion with lots of fights between spaceships and soldiers on the ground and attacks to Empire bases. The image and action sequences are well succeeded and keep the viewer attentive and interested. This is about a terrible super weapon the Empire has got and that is capable of destroying any planet. The Rebellion is trying to get the weapon plans to be able to turn it inoperative by activating a flaw that was put in it by the scientist who created it and was secretly supporting the Rebellion. Felicity Jones does a great role as the heroin. Well this is a movie that keeps you attentive all the time and that is all.,6,1,5,20 August 2017
Shakespeare in Love," Nice movie, poor story
","Well of course I know that John Madden never intended to give us any accurate true episode of Shakespeare's life. But it reveals lack of imagination to base the plot of 'Romeo and Juliet' on a totally invented love that would (could?) have happened between the playwright and a lady promised as a bride to a lord. But if you just forget this detail the movie is agreeable to watch, being a half-comedy and a half-tragedy. The best moments of the movie are the parts where the real play is performed since 'Romeo and Juliet' keeps being the best and most beautiful love story ever written not matched at all by the love story narrated in the movie. One word of praise to Gwyneth Paltrow, her shining beauty and her splendid performance. Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth acts also her part very well. But Joseph Fiennes is almost totally displaced as Shakespeare. Just only a goody-goody movie after all.",6,1,3,6 September 2006
Alien: Resurrection," Nothing original
","The problem with these stories that develop themselves in several successive episodes is that quality deteriorates from the first on. This saga of the alien monsters doesn't escape this rule. If the first movie was good mainly for the originality of the main theme and the creativity of its conception the following ones became repetitive and mere action movies for lack of ideas(I must say however that I have not yet seen the third one). If you still recall the first movie you may remember that the monsters' image was only suggested by some glimpses which left large field for the viewer's imagination to conceive them. From the moment they began to be shown entirely they lost much of their power to thrill or scare us. This 4th episode has indeed some good and some original ideas. But like someone already said about a certain novel, the good ones are not original and the original ones are not good. The rest is mere action to rivet your attention till the ending which is moreover predictable. There is therefore not much to credit this movie except that it's technically well made but you know the part that computers take nowadays in this kind of sci-fi movies. A final note to say that the acting was not very good with the exception of Sigourney Weaver of course. All the others were much stereotyped some of them almost as monstrous as the monsters themselves mainly in moral terms.",5,1,2,5 August 2005
Zootopia," Full of imagination
","This animated movie can be appreciated both by children and grown-ups. It shows a cast of anthropomorphic animals living in a big town who are shaped and conceived like humans also in behaviour, virtues and vices. Their facial expressions and body movements are truly human and very varied. Their conception is full of imagination and originality. The story is very human also, simultaneously funny and thrilling: a conspiracy that tries to convince the town inhabitants that a biological change has occurred in predators till then peaceful making them again wild and dangerous. This conspiracy is investigated by the strange pair of a sly fox and a zealous rabbit police girl which results in some funny episodes. An enjoyable movie to spend a couple of hours watching it.",7,2,12,22 March 2016
The Impossible," The Impossible may sometimes become possible
","Mainly when family love and human solidarity are at work. This is the true story (so it's said) of a family of five (father, mother and three small children) that goes on what was intended to be relaxing holidays in a seaside resort in Thailand but is suddenly caught by a horrible tsunami that puts them on the verge of losing their lives in the question of a couple of hours or even less. The mother and the eldest son are swept miles away by the razing stream while the father and the other two children manage to keep themselves more or less unhurt by managing to climb to trees around the resort. The mother is however severely wounded by hitting herself to several heavy objects on her forced and violent course. Each of these two groups know nothing of what happened to the other and even suspect that the others could be dead. Although a tsunami is a rare phenomenon the story in its terms is a normal one I mean that in any similar circumstances it's normal that each member of a family who is separated from others by a catastrophe does all efforts to look for and find the others. But the great merit of the film resides not only on the dramatic scenes and episodes of the desperate father's search of his wife and eldest son but also on the intense emotional happenings and experiences in which the story is told and develops itself till in the end the five members of the family are again reunited due also to a few coincidences and incidental events (i. e. the difficulty in starting the engine of the small lorry where the father is to be carried away of the hospital where his wife and son were without having being able of finding them, which delays its departure and allows that father and son meet at last)which are nevertheless totally acceptable in terms of verisimilitude. And the images of the tsunami razing everything in its course and of the fight of mother and son against its violent and tumultuous stream are appalling and and overwhelming and filmed with unsurpassable realism. To end it up we must refer the acting which is very good mainly of the eldest boy (Lucas, performed by the young Tom Holland).",7,0,0,1 February 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A succession of thrilling scenes
","If you still remember those old pirates movies with Errol Flynn, Walter Slezak or Douglas Fairbanks (Sr and Jr) please forget them because this movie has nothing to do with them not only because the means employed are quite more developed but also because we are not in presence of a mere adventure movie but before a movie which combines in well balanced doses comedy, suspense, horror and of course also adventure and action. The images are fairly beautiful making a pleasure for the eye, both static and action ones. The characters are sufficiently typical and convincing and the stereotyped traits of some of them are aimed at making you laugh. And what about the story? Well as you know the story in this kind of movies is always the weakest part with its usual flaws but we must tolerate it as the necessary conducting wire giving a logical sequence to all the scenes. So if you don't have anything better to do or to watch go see this movie. It will keep you fairly amused during more than two hours.",6,2,4,18 September 2003
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Almost good
","It would be a good movie if it weren't for its indecision between being a funny movie and a serious sentimental one. But anyway it has enough of both features to make it agreeable to watch though on the whole it has too many funny scenes to be considered serious and too many serious scenes to be considered funny. But it has some witty dialogues and a few powerful sentimental scenes along with funny ones. The story tells us about a few crossed love situations: a 13 year old boy in love with his 17 year old babysitter who is herself in love with the boy's father, a husband and a wife who seem to be on the verge of a divorce which appears not to be wished by the husband and maybe also not fully for the wife despite of her confessed adultery, a husband who tries to take lessons of seduction from a professional philanderer and a few confusing situations that finish with a great surprise in the end. In sum a pleasant but not too ambitious movie.",8,0,1,16 October 2011
The Danish Girl," Passionate
",The intense drama of a man awakening for his transsexuality is admirably given in this passionate movie not only for the plot building but also for the excellent performance of its actors chiefly of Alicia Vikander and Eddie Redmayne in the main roles. His drama spreads itself to his loving wife and later on to a childhood friend (Mathias Schoenaerts as the friend Hans Axgil) forming a love triangle. This is based on a veridical actual story of real people that took place in Copenhagen and Paris on early 20th century. The movie develops itself in scenes of great dramatic depth and intensity. In those early times transsexuality was often confused with homossexuality and even classified as insanity. This atmosphere is also somewhat felt in the movie. This is one of the best movies shown in 2015/16.,8,1,2,11 November 2016
Elizabeth," The building of a Queen
","A historic fiction work (a novel, a play or a film) doesn't need to respect historic true in every detail to be of great value. Some narrative freedom may be allowed in order to promote aesthetic values or beauty providing the true essence of historic facts is not altered. This movie abides entirely by these rules and gives us a story of what in its essence might have been the ascent of Queen Elizabeth I of England to the throne and the intrigues, enmities and hardships she had to fight in that ascent and on the first days of her reign to impose herself in the end as the Queen who made England the first power of the time. Cate Blanchett does a reasonable and rather acceptable role as the Queen, passing from a somewhat childish behaviour in the beginning (very understandable allowing for her youth) to a progressively more serious and stern one as far as she went on imposing herself to friends and foes. The images and scenes show adequately an accurate and even beautiful reconstitution of that historic epoch. However I think that some scenes and dialogues are too 'modern' for the epoch in terms of values as well as of some liberties Lord Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes) takes with the Queen in the presence of other people namely the court, which I don't think would be admitted at the time. Not a masterpiece but just a rather good historic movie anyway.",7,0,0,2 January 2012
Spider-Man 2," If crime could be fought this way...
","These movies are rich in terms of images, action and movement thanks to computer tricks but usually poor indeed in terms of ideas and sentiments which is something computers are not yet able to create. Spider-Man 2 also abides by this rule since it has got good and original ideas but the good ones are not original and the original ones are not good. In what refers to sentiments it's not above cheap pink novels level except in the dialogues where Parker's aunt takes part which are very moving sometimes. The old story of the crazy scientist that wants to create new powerful energy sources in order to be able to become master of the world or something like that ultimately, is already worn and weary. And in this movie you never come to understand very well how and why the mechanical arms that he invents come to dominate his brains and seem to proceed by thinking for him. The story of the hero who renounces love to fight crime is also a bit worn and weary. Moreover if crime -- which has got social roots like everybody knows -- could be efficiently fought by any comic strips hero or the like, the problem would have been solved long ago. This being the case, what is left of this movie in positive terms besides the amazing cybernetic images? The rare moments of emotion in the above mentioned dialogues, a very powerful and excellent musical sound track and a few successful situation or visual gags which exploit the naïveté and awkwardness of the Pete Parker character in his normal life, i. e. out of the moments when he personifies Spider-Man. It's very little indeed.",5,0,1,28 July 2004
Billy Elliot," Life is hard and art is beautiful
","Well, life and art don't always get along with each other. Life has its hard laws and art is an expression of human freedom. Two miners, father and son fight for a better life for themselves and their family while the youngest member of that same family dreams of becoming a dancer. That means also a hard fight for himself, against his own family to begin with. In the end life meets art. For ever. This movie is really beautiful and moving and shows us that even on a mount of stones a flower grows sometimes. All the actors involved have excellent performances chiefly the young Jamie Bell in the main role.",7,0,0,6 March 2001
Finding Nemo," Take your kids along with you
","These more or less anthropomorphic cartoon movies in which animals behave like human beings can convey strong moral messages while at same time amusing your kids a lot. Therefore it's very appropriate to take them along with you. On the other hand they can also feature animals (or some species) as friendly creatures ready to love and be loved and prone to tribulation sometimes too. In this concrete case we have an animal species not very often portrayed: fish. Which can also be nice and attractive like any other animals. I remember now 'Bugs' another movie featuring a much less attractive species and which was also a good one. If you can make bugs appear as nice beings you can make it with any other kind of animals. Nowadays those movies are all made with the help of computers which makes them much easier to make without by saying this, belittling the directors and other technicians' talents. In this movie fatherly love is the main theme and you can draw the following maxim from the story: kids must obey their parents to avoid getting into trouble. A last word to the images and visual effects. Yes they are beautiful visions of underwater seascape and of the sea bottom, full of colour and fantasy. In conclusion I can say that I've seen better cartoon movies but also some not so good therefore the final conclusion is largely positive.",7,0,1,25 February 2004
Alexander," Great film too
","The story of the great king, later emperor, Alexander of Macedonia, son of Philip II is here somewhat abridgedly told (for instance Alexander invaded Persia twice and not only once) but with great, beautiful and strong images based on an acceptable screen-play from the historical truth point of view. If not for other virtues that the movie has got, the battle scenes would be enough for they are filmed with great realism and boldness indeed in spite of involving thousands of men, horses and in the end even elephants, with the camera (or the cameras) moving right in the middle of the fighting whirl. The story of how this young king has built from the small kingdom of Macedonia (including Greece already conquered by his father)an empire that reached the borders of India is in fact here presented with great force, realism and credibility notwithstanding its fictional nature. The character of Alexander is very well performed by Colin Farrell. The narrative process is rather original but very effective anyway. It is Ptolemy, one of Alexander's immediate successors to whom the throne of Egypt was given after the emperor'r death, who, already an old man tells the whole story that develops itself before our eyes, to a group of young students. This movie must be seen by everyone who loves Cinema ans History simultaneously.",8,2,3,8 January 2012
The Others," A story of life and death
",What's life? What's death? And who are the others after all? The living or the dead? You will not find the answers to these questions in the movie though it deals with them somehow. This a very original movie in its kind I mean the ghost story movies kind. It has a few contact points with other movies involving ghosts and children like for instance 'The Innocents' or 'Shining' though maybe not so scary like the latter(nevertheless of course a bit scary anyway like any ghost story worth of its title). But it has the advantage of having a very surprising end that will leave you almost breathless though not exactly horrified since it's even somewhat poetical. The acting is great not only by Nicole Kidman as the main character but above all by the two children that do extraordinary performances. The interior scenery of the old mansion where the story takes place is quite convincing and very much fit to the general atmosphere of the plot. A good movie indeed though not exactly a masterpiece because the story doesn't give great occasion to that classification in all its details since in these stories that mix natural with supernatural it's always difficult to make things logical and illogical at same time.,7,1,2,29 March 2009
Spotlight," Courageous journalism
","A reporters team of a Boston newspaper engage themselves in investigating deeply the scandal of pedophilia practised by some Catholic priests on children supposed to be guarded and protected by them. They intend to publish the investigation results afterwards. What begins to look like just only a handful of cases becomes to reveal itself a practice of systematic abuse of lots of children in several places in the country during many years with the covering of high placed members of the hierarchy. The team comes upon several obstacles, from the more or less disguised opposition of the Church members to occultation attempts by lawyers who took part in private and half secret settlements between some victims and the hierarchy, passing through occultation of important documentary evidence (not only by lawyers) and the resistance of some victims to talk about their cases. Everything is shown in this movie in an almost documentary style with great fluidity and dynamism and very elucidative of what has really happened since this was a real case.",8,0,0,11 February 2016
Insomnia," It's so easy to kill someone
",It's really so easy to kill someone even when you don't want to. Or is it that you really didn't want to? What is conscience? What is guilt? Does the end justify the means? What is a good cop? What is a bad one? Someone already said that a good cop is the one who solves more crimes than those he commits himself. This is all what this movie is about and the story evolves in the beautiful and almost unreal landscape of Alaska in summer when there is no sunset and insomnia seizes bodies and minds. The first images are terribly ominous showing an almost unwordly landscape seen from the air and they are made even more ominous by a music sound track of heavy and overwhelming density and sullenness. Al Pacino is great is the role of the super-detective who nevertheless has got his Achilles heel and what a big one. Robin Williams on the contrary seems not very much at ease in his first role of a villain. Anyway this is a good movie and in my opinion much worth to be seen.,7,0,0,12 September 2002
The Day After Tomorrow," Almost good
","If it were not for a certain naïveté in the treatment of the story, a few inaccuracies and some improbable human exploits, this movie would be a good one. But it reaches almost that stage because the excellent images chiefly the appalling ones that show the storm breaking out upon the urban scenery and the people and the incisive cut of sequences developing themselves in several different places add to its credit. And last but not least the strong message conveyed by the movie as a warning to what can happen if mankind goes on wasting and damaging natural resources and the global climate. Of course we know that such a dramatic catastrophe could not occur in a few hours as the movie shows. But that is purely symbolic and irrelevant. The important is the impact those powerful images have in our minds; of course the movie could not narrate with such impact a process developing itself in years, months or even weeks. The sentimental story narrated along the movie integrates it well and combines itself adequately with its general atmosphere. One last word for some well presented secondary characters. I mention for instance the tramp with his dog caught like all the other people in the middle of the tragedy and the two workmates of the scientist who chose to stay with him in his dangerous exploit instead of looking for a safe place for themselves. Well in fact in this movie all people are good. There are no villains.",7,0,0,2 June 2004
Match Point," Good movie weak story
","If you still remember Woody Allen's movies just forget it while watching this movie because it has nothing to do with his style or his favourite themata. We are thousands of miles away from a movie built along a series of witty, rich and vivid intellectual dialogues and monologues. We watch here only a serious psychological drama. It's doubtless a movie made with great mastery upon a weak and trite story. As a matter of fact we have already seen lots of movies and read lots of novels about the parvenu who climbs the social ladder by beginning to marry a tycoon's daughter and getting a good job in one of father-in-law's companies till his love affair with a woman out of his new acquired social ring comes to compromise everything, leading from a certain moment on to dangerous crossroads where dramatic choices must be quickly made. We remember for instance the excellent 'Room at the Top' (1959) by Jack Clayton with Lawrence Harvey and Simone Signoret. In conclusion I think that although this is not a bad movie the story is too trivial for the genius of someone like Woody Allen to be wasted upon it.",6,2,4,23 March 2006
Zodiac," Not particularly brilliant
","This was a veridical case so they say. It's more the story of the investigation of several murders done by a psychopath serial killer than a thriller about the murders themselves. After police having given up the investigation and closed the case without getting any solid evidence that would allow them to get to the murderer, a newspaper cartoonist becomes obsessed with the case and starts an investigation on his own account. This is the main feature of the movie sometimes a bit thrilling but most of the time rather dull and monotonous like a not very exciting investigation documentary report. I must confess I almost fell asleep a few times during it. A not exactly bad but not particularly brilliant movie",6,0,0,24 April 2011
Milk," Real, true and convincing
","If you are strongly prejudiced against gays don't go to watch this movie because it will do you no good at all. But if you are unprejudiced or think you can overcome your prejudice you'll find this movie a good one. It was based on real events that took place in San Francisco's public and political life in the seventies of last century when an assumed gay after a few previous defeats, ran successfully for the post of municipal supervisor in the city, protesting to defend not only gays but all the other discriminated minorities rights. The whole story is well balanced in the sense that we are confronted with all the usual arguments for and against gays rights but showing anyway gays as normal human beings and not freaks. Sean Penn does a remarkable role as the protagonist and his acting is really strong and convincing. The only weak part of the movie seems to me to be the character of Dan White (done by Josh Brolin) another municipal supervisor which is not very well and clearly characterized particularly in what concerns his tragic actions in the end of the movie whose motives don't appear as strong enough to explain such tragic deeds. Nevertheless this is a good,true and well told story (both in images and dialogues), well acted and well directed in terms of form and content.",7,1,4,4 March 2009
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Appalling images
","Yes appalling images, scenes, creatures and special effects of the best quality. That's what aestheticians call the horrendous beautiful. But before going further on I must issue a warning: I have never seen the first part of this series therefore my comments are focused exclusively on this second movie without any direct or indirect reference to the first one. This movie combines science and historical fiction with romanticism and even good humour sometimes in a delightful mixture. It's not common to see paranormal and supernatural creatures behaving, talking and feeling like human beings and mixing up with them in a natural way. We have seen this for instance in the Star Wars trilogy but the action in those movies was not taking place in our planet Earth not in our times like this one is. We can even see the paranormals in some funny human-like situations and telling human-like jokes though these are only mere details in the general atmosphere of the movie which is by no means funny. The story is quite credible, taking of course for granted its supernatural fiction features and aspects. It's indeed one of the best movies of this kind I have ever seen.",7,0,2,3 September 2008
Cloverfield," Good form not so good contents
","Yes we keep bound up on our chairs and thrilled watching that appalling escape of the youngsters through New York while a monster is attacking the city and giant spiders attack the fugitives to bite them.. All is filmed supposedly by the portable camera of Hud, one of them, that's why the thrilling images go up and down all the time. The contents of the movie are rather poor. We don't know who the monster is nor where did he come from and why is he attacking the city. And the final scene is utterly strange and unexplained. Well it keeps you chair-ridden till the end anxious to know the ending but it is quite disappointing and ununderstandable. And what means 'Cloverfield' in this movie? All this not enough to make a good movie.",6,0,0,29 November 2018
Hotel Rwanda," The word is genocide
","Yes genocide committed against Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda in 1994: almost one million dead. The authors of the massacre were the Hutu militiamen. A particular savage massacre including of children and women done chiefly with cutlasses. This is what this movie is about and it describes and shows the situation and the various acts of violence in a very realistic and convincing way. But this is also the story of a particularly courageous man, a Hutu hotel manager married to a Tutsi who, risking his own life and safety, sheltered in his hotel in Kigali more than 1,000 people of the Tutsi ethnic group thus saving their lives. A small parenthesis now to say that some ethnologists say that the differences between Hutus and Tutsis are much more social than ethnic. It was fomented by German and Belgian colonists during their respective rules of the countries of Rwanda and Burundi following the old maxim that to rule you must divide; the German colonists considered Hutus those natives who possessed more than ten cows or (and) had an European-like straight nose. Both groups had lived in peace till the arrival of Germans first and Belgians later and only after that and after the decolonization period they began to be at each other's throats with Hutus killing Tutsis in Rwanda and Tutsis killing Hutus in the neighbouring Burundi. But going back to the movie this is in fact a true story (in the sense that the narrated facts happened indeed) and told in a succession of revealing episodes, images and dialogues of great strength that don't put aside the clear responsibility of western powers who deliberately withdrew their troops and abandoned the victims to their doom betraying their mission of maintaining order and protecting innocent civilians. Also an excellent performance of the cast mainly of the principal protagonists such as the Hutu hotel manager, his Tutsi wife and the UN commander in charge of protecting the hotel with a ridiculous half a dozen troops or so but who, despite that, accomplishes his mission in a brave and gallant way (performed by Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo and the veteran Nick Nolte).",8,0,0,7 June 2009
The Hateful Eight," A brutal movie
","I don't remember having ever seen any such brutal movie like this, with so many killings in a close space. But it is anyway a good movie though not very good only because the story is not particularly moving or interesting. Fundamentally it deals with a bounty hunter who is taking to a town as his prisoner in a stage coach a woman who had committed a murder, to be presented to justice and probably hanged. For that he will receive 10 thousand dollars as a reward. All this in the middle of a terrible snow storm and an awful cold. What would be an easy task turns out a very complicated one for the appearing of several individuals and the gathering of all the people in some kind of bar cabin in the middle of that stormy wilderness. Later we learn that some were there to wait for the prisoner and free her although they disguise their aim and identities. What has begun to be an apparent cordial relationship among all the people turns soon out on a relation of violent hostility with successive killings and blood everywhere. However, technically it is a very well made movie and very well acted. All the characters are very well characterized and made up in terms of physical appearances, dialogues and action. There are also scenes of great dramatic intensity. It is a movie that has also something to do with human nature.",7,2,6,18 February 2016
Ocean's Twelve," Confusing and unconvincing
","Would you believe that a casino owner who has been robbed by a group of gangsters would seek them one by one one giving them 15 days to give him back all the money they stole him in a holdup plus interests, to avoid being killed? And that the gangsters would get together again and decide to do as he wishes planning then a few more holdups to get the necessary money to pay the casino owner? And that they would come to Europe to carry that plan out in Amsterdam and Rome of all places? And that their ways would cross with other famous thieves' tracks one of them known for a lot of holdups in a short period including stealing the King of Morocco's yacht? And that there would also be a competition among our bunch of thieves and another well known burglar with the only aim of proving which one was the best? OK if you can believe all this go and enjoy this movie that will take you into a very confusing and unconvincing plot full of sudden, unexpected and unbelievable turns. The movie is only saved of being totally disgraceful by an excellent sound and music track and a good performance of all actors involved. It's a poor sequel of Ocean's Eleven but modern movie directors seem not to be able to escape the temptation of making sequels of famous movies thus trying to revive their success almost always without good results. This time not even the attempt of giving the sequel a more cosmopolitan atmosphere than the first one had, has contributed in whatever to improve it. A misused cast of great actors who deserved better.",6,0,1,19 January 2005
The Expendables," Not bad
","This movie isn't worse or better than movies of this sort. No special flaws. The usual lots of fights, killings, shots, explosions, fires and car chases. Great work by the stunts. Particularly in this movie about 50% of the time is spent with these violent scenes. A team of tough mercenaries is hired by CIA in a half clandestine way to go to a Latin American Island ruled by a dictator with the complicity of a CIA deserter who also lead a huge drug trafficking business. Their mission is to kill the dictator The gang men are very muscular as usual with Sylvester Stallone which is very helpful in physical struggles they have to get involved in. A sentimental detail is introduced in this violent climate when the Stallone's character takes a liking to the dictator's daughter who is betraying her father and acts also to save her from the grab of the CIA deserter. Well a movie for you to watch if you have nothing better to do. Then you can spend some time entertained.",6,0,0,2 August 2015
The Book Thief," It could be better
","We have here a movie that portrays with enough realism the atmosphere of Nazi Germany in the years that preceded World War II and during it. A tyrannic atmosphere where human beings lived oppressed by inhuman values no matter they were supported by a lot a fanatics. It's the story of a girl whose mother was a communist and as such she had been probably sent to a concentration camp, a detail we never are exactly aware of. The girl is withdrawn from her mother and comes to live with a couple who has adopted her and of whom the husband is a tender hearted man but the wife is rude although not wicked. They shelter a young Jewish man who is trying to escape arrest and deportation to a death camp like it's happening to all Jews in Germany then. The girl steals books of a Nazi authority's library and bring them home to read and lends them to the Jewish young man with whom she at once establishes a very deep friendly relationship. The story is moving though not particularly deep. But it could be much better if it didn't erect Death -- let's say -- as the main character whose voice off as narrator is heard now and then as if he was master of the world and mankind which in my opinion introduces a negative value in the movie.",6,1,2,15 June 2014
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Such good players so ill-spent
","Such excellent players like Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are ill-spent in this not better than fair movie. The best of it is the Victorian London atmosphere in interiors, exteriors and clothes, aristocratic and popular. The story in itself is somewhat abstruse. A corrupt judge is aroused by the beautiful wife of a barber and to be able to take hold of her has her husband imprisoned on a false accusation and sent to deportation. He comes back fifteen years later with a false identity and wants to take his revenge on the judge. The next episodes are grandguignolesque and somewhat incomprehensible filled with several murders of the barber's clients in the barber's shop he had installed in the first floor of a confectionery owned by a woman with whom he starts a love relationship. He cuts their throats while pretending to shave them. The victims' bodies are used by that woman to bake meat pies. Among other things, what is strange is that no friends or relatives ever turned up to query about those disappearances. The barber ends up by getting hold of the judge after attracting him to the barber shop on a false promise and he cuts his throat there. And from horrifying scene to horrifying scene everything turns out badly to the barber, his companion and even his wife that appears in the end and who he thought was dead a long time ago. He cuts her throat too since he didn't recognize her and thought she was the beggar in whom she had changed herself. Awful indeed.",6,1,2,30 June 2016
The Polar Express," It could be a great movie
","Are human actors expendable? Are we witnessing the beginning of their replacement by animated characters no matter how much 'human' they can look like? Why? Is it cheaper? Or does it avoid directors the trouble of directing them and having so often to deal with their whimsical behaviour? Well anyway it's indubitable that my vote of 7 for this movie could be 2 or 3 points higher if the characters where human and not mere computer made puppets. Because it has all the ingredients to be a great Christmas movie conveying everything good that's contained in Christmas spirit and message: a good and original story, beautiful images (some of them breath-taking) and a well shaped team of characters, everything totally adequated to the beauty and fantasy of the Christmas atmosphere as we all have always imagined it mainly when we were children. And don't tell me please that if the movie were made with human actors it could not have the amazing and fantastic scenes it portrays. Today computer techniques allow to combine the most audacious special effects with human acting including that of children. And no computer can replace real human acting, real human gestures and expressions. Thus this movie left me a bit disappointed.",7,1,4,2 January 2005
Closer," What is love?
","This is old Mike Nichols at his best. The theme of love which he treated so many years ago with a dramatic approach in 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' comes back now in an apparently less dramatic way. What is love indeed and what is the meaning of the words 'I love you'? Are those who pronounce them always convinced that they are speaking the truth? Can a man (or a woman) love two women (or two men) at same time? All these questions arise in this movie in a continuous succession of encounters and dis-encounters in a permanent sway between the same four people whose characters are superbly acted by the four main performers. This is how love between men and women must be faced in modern life and I can't remember now any movie where this conflicting reality is presented in such an authentic way. The most important feature of this movie is made by the dialogues between the protagonists. The sentences are short, incisive, bright and intelligent. Through them we can learn all about the characters and penetrate deeply inside their souls and discover their feelings. It's true that love and all the feelings related to it maybe the same since the Antiquity till nowadays. But modern times with all the liberties they have brought give birth to more dramatic events because it's not true that freedom of love has curbed drama down. On the contrary the more freedom the more drama mainly interior drama because freedom of decision and choice brings more responsibility and the correlative anguish. One detail: the faked cybersex scene is hilarious and reveals much of what human soul hides in its deepness even in what concerns normal human beings. I think that this movie will enrich your knowledge of the modern human behaviour in respect to love between the sexes.",7,0,1,19 February 2005
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Almost only images
","Yes images show car crashes, cuffing snd punching, shooting, fires and explosions galore and all the time. The visual effects and the stunt performers are overwhelming indeed and that is almost all since the plot is rather weak. We hardly can tell who are the good boys and the bad boys (supposing of course that Captain America is on the side of the good ones) and it's difficult to tell who is against whom and what are they aiming at. The Winter Soldier is mentioned only once and it is difficult to say who he is. Well it's a movie to be seen and forgotten.",5,1,4,16 September 2018
Life of Pi," Some scenes are gorgeous
",Chiefly those at the sea including the stormy ones. It's actually a very well filmed movie from the technical point of view. The story is deep enough I mean the story of the boy in a boat with a tiger for 22 days after the shipwreck of the boat where both were travelling. Because as we see at the end this was only one of the two possible stories since the boy after having reached Mexico and been admitted to a hospital tells the representatives of the Japanese company that owned the ship a quite different story (although dramatic as well) after they told him they didn't believe in the first one. This feature of the plot enhances the quality of the film. Which one was true? We'll never know but both are very rich in their dramatic contents. The visual special effects are splendid and fortunately most of them were made by computer work since a few acts of cruelty against living animals (or presented as such) would have been to blame. Not exactly a very good movie but good enough and worth to be seen.,7,2,5,30 December 2012
Ocean's Thirteen," Weak movie, weak story
","'Ocean's 11' was an excellent movie, 'Ocean's 12' was much less good and this one is merely passable. Our well known gang of crooks decides to revenge one of them who had been victim of another crook in some affair, by sabotaging the splendorous inauguration of the latter's casino in Las Vegas. Then we watch for two hours a tedious succession of the several actions of the preparation and carrying out of the sabotage plan most of them quite unplausible and not well explained. For instance the drugging and seduction of the swindler's right-hand lady by a young member of the gang leading her to take him to the secluded room where the diamonds the gang must steal are stored, is plainly ludicrous and unbelievable. If I rated this movie with 5 it was only for the performance of its cast including some famous actors like George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Al Pacino whose talents are here clearly wasted.",5,4,7,19 June 2007
Lost in Translation," Combustion without flame
","This story of sudden love between a middle-aged man and a young wife, disillusioned with her marriage and in poor spirits, in a Tokyo resplendent with lights and neon, is not very convincing for lack of enough definition and explanation of both characters. Nevertheless the story in itself is well told and Bill Murray makes an excellent imperturbable and somewhat phlegmatic typical American including in some funny situations like the one when he is visited in his hotel room by a modern geisha trying to offer him her massage ability in which he seems not to be really interested. There is not much more to say about this movie whose development including the final scenes, is predictable. We have seen this same theme of an impossible love developing itself in a combustion without flame in many other movies. We'd like to stress however, to its credit, that the story shows remarkable chastity avoiding the trap of the too easy outcome of lovers going hurriedly to bed with each other sometimes and in some movies in a nonsensical way like if sex, which is undoubtedly a very important thing, were the most important thing in this world and always unavoidable. This movie is also well made technically in an agile and lively cut made of short and contrasting expressive scenes. In short, you will neither gain not lose anything if you see this movie.",8,0,1,5 February 2004
Doctor Strange," Not too good not too bad
","But it keeps you entertained all the time you keep yourself watching it through a lot of suspense and frightful visual effects that make you to forget its several goofs and factual errors usual in this kind of movies. It is the story of a great neurosurgeon that has a car accident which ruins his hands preventing him of perform surgery anymore. He is a kind of stubborn guy with a powerful ego and since he cannot be cured by traditional medicine he goes to Nepal to meet a magic master (a strange lady)hoping that maybe she can cure him through the learning of mystic arts. From then on, however the story complicates itself a lot turning itself into a struggle between forces of Good and black forces of Evil that are trying to destroy our world. Besides its several adventurous scenes this movie has also some metaphysical ambitions and tries to deal with things like Life, Death and Eternity which are too complicated themes to be successfully treated in a movie of this kind. Anyway I have seen better of this kind but much worse also.",6,1,1,28 June 2017
American Sniper," Only technically good
",Of course Clint Eastwood is a great film director and this movie is technically very good. The fighting and shooting scenes are particularly well filmed. But in what concerns contents it is just only passable. This is based on the true story of Chris Kyle an American that decides to enroll himself in a special army corps after he sees on TV the terrorist attacks on 9/11 in New York. He becomes a special shot of exceptionally good aim who kills lots of enemies in Iraq as a sniper which makes him a legend. He can shoot them at such long distances that might make it a bit unlikely in the view of anyone who has served in the army even if he uses always a telescopic sight. He goes there in four tours leaving wife and two kids at home something that his wife doesn't particularly appreciate. The story in itself is not more dramatic than in most war movies. It has nothing special to be marked.,5,2,11,11 February 2015
The Devil Wears Prada," What are you aiming at in life?
",This is movie is apparently about fashion but really about human nature. What are you aiming at in life when you chose a job? Just only something that gives you a salary that allows you to pay for your expenses and survive? Or something that fulfills the deepest aspirations of your personality? Or something that gives you power over other people? Or something that will eventually place you up in the social scale? Or something at which you can show your special talent and skill? And how can you deal with a tyrannical boss that doesn't show the least respect for you as a human being? These are the questions put in this movie and with great talent by its director. Meryl Streep does an excellent part as the tough and tyrannical boss of a famous fashion magazine. The atmosphere of the magazine offices is hectic due mainly to the permanent orders and countermands of the despotic director which often causes the newly admitted assistant (Anne Hathaway's character) to be stricken with panic. All these scenes and situations are shown and developed in a tremendous but excellent visual rhythm and the cast performing is also superb. This is was undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year. But can anyone please tell what the movie title has got to do with its contents?,8,0,3,28 January 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A marvel for the eye
","I've not seen the first movie of these series therefore I cannot compare. This movie has got all the qualities and faults that usually are shown by this kind of movies. On the positive side we can name action, movement, marvellous images and a clockwork precision in the image cut. On the negative side there is always the poorness of the story and the message. Lucas is really however a great master of this kind of movies from the technical point of view, maybe the greatest one. The movie theme is the endless fight of good and evil expressing itself here in well built scenes of battles or individual duels of great strength and movement. This kind of movies for lack of imagination of what can be a different world in terms of towns, buildings, clothes, weapons and general behaviour, often recreate past centuries images with frequent reference to the Middle Age or even the antiquity. In this particular movie we have even the recreation of some kind of Roman Circus fighting with a lot of adaptation (lions replaced by monsters etc). One last word to characterize what in my opinion is a good sci-fi novel or movie. Not that one where Cowboys and Indians (or nazis and democratic armies) are replaced by people with futurist clothes and weapons but fighting for the same values as we know them today but a story where we are faced with fictional different values, a different social and social structure i. e. a really different world being the work of the author's creative mind. This movie is very far from such a definition.",6,0,1,26 May 2002

But I had the privilege of reading their stories on Brazilian juvenile magazines I used to borrow from a friend who came from Brazil and brought lots of them. Therefore to watch this movie has brought old memories to me though this version is quite different from the old ones. But sticking to the movie, this is an action movie that adds something more to the story than average action movies usually do: it has an ideology and a healthy one: antinazism. Notwithstanding that the villain here (Johann Schmidt / Red Skull) is some kind of a Nazi dissident who wants to exploit his superpowers to his own profit. The rest is the usual amount of classic brilliant computer made special visual effects, the thrilling action and the no less usual suspense clichés. The ending is a open one and a bit confusing or not fully explained. Any way if you go to see this movie you will spend a couple of hours amused and entertained.",6,0,2,16 August 2011
American Hustle," Conning plentifully
","This movie develops itself in a captivating atmosphere of conning and swindling that involves not only the conning characters but also such types as FBI agents, mafia men, Congressmen and a mayor of New Jersey. The performers act very well in their roles convincing us of the portrayed figures. The set schemes are too complicated and sometimes their details become somewhat incomprehensible for the unguarded viewer. A FBI agent obtains the help of a couple of conners (a man and his smart and cunning girlfriend) to catch some corrupt politicians red handed but this generates a lot of complicated relations that involve the sentimental relationships between men and women with some unexpected consequences to the planned schemes. These conners and swindlers are not presented like the usual stereotypes of bad people but like normal people instead with human feelings and reactions from love to anger. The story is quite believable in terms of reality and well directed and acted in filming terms.",7,5,7,28 January 2014
The Godfather: Part II," The Corleone Saga goes on
","If you have not seen the first movie you won't understand this one fully. In fact it continues the Corleone story almost without break, with Don Vito's son taking brilliantly the role of his father. A few well inserted flashbacks will help you to understand better the biography of Don Vito thus completing a few aspects the first movie had left in the obscurity. The rest is the usual story of the struggle for power among mafia families but very well told in a captivating way. Which doesn't prevent the director to go on presenting those gangsters like human beings with their family problems interfering sometimes with their criminal activities. Murder is an ordinary event normally used to punish a betrayal but also to attain the gangsters' purposes in the attainment of their businesses. Although the acting lacks the superb performance of a sacred monster like Marlon Brando in the first part of this saga, it's good enough and all players do their parts convincingly well with special prominence to Al Pacino and Diane Keaton.",7,0,3,29 September 2007
The Aviator," Crazy movie
","And the story is also that of a crazy man, the famous millionaire Howard Hughes who had a tremendous initiative power always acting stubbornly against all tides and winds to achieve his aims. Besides a great businessman he also excelled in such different activities as plane driver and movie director. Crazy and unpredictable but also a human being with all the respective frailties and idiosyncrasies. In my opinion DiCaprio was not a good choice for this character since his boyish appearance and manners make the character very unconvincing. It would require a more strong personality such as of De Niro or Liam Neeson for instance. And a curious note: the portrayed characters never get physically older. All of them during the about 30 years in which the story develops itself, keep the same physical aspect which they had at their first appearance including the main character after all those vicissitudes he had to endure. Also the sudden changes of Hughes from sanity to insanity and back are not well characterized or explained, with DeCaprio revealing himself a mediocre actor once more. But except these flaws the movie is well done, the story is solid and sound and its events develop themselves in a good rhythm and the music is excellent. The scenes of the Senate Committee hearings are also a high moment in the movie. After all this movie is worth to be seen.",7,0,0,3 March 2005
Bohemian Rhapsody," Great movie
",The life of Freddie Mercury and his success as one of the greatest rock stars in the world. How a young parsi from Pakistan became a great rock concert star. Of course if you don't love rock music maybe you won't like this movie. I do not appreciate particularly rock music but loved this film. Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury has a great performance. His rock concerts mainly as the vocalista of the Queen's band are pucntuated by dramatic events related to his relationship with the other band members and managers and to his love and sex life. The concerts shown are magnificenrt and gorgeour indeed. It's a movie that seduces and captivates you from the first to the last scene.,8,1,1,14 November 2018
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," A ggod man
","Yes, a good man in the middle of a dirty war of which we don't see much anyway. A soldier of USA air force who is also a disc jockey is brought from Crete to Vietnam to amuse American troops through the Armed Force Radio in Saigon in 1965. He starts a half crazy humorous program that quickly wins the applause and pleasure of the GIs but at same time shocks and displeases his superiors that think he is not acting according to true military values and begin opposing themselves to him for the way he kids and jests with certain values and persons of the official politics. The situation becomes worse when he becomes friendly acquainted with some natives till he feels himself even sentimentally attached to a Vietnamese girl. Besides the humorous scenes there is also some slight drama everything well directed and excellently acted by Robin Williams as the main character.",7,1,1,12 August 2016
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Again the saga of the fight between Good and Evil
","The fight between Good end Evil has been the object on numerous stories and legends throughout the centuries. This movie is one more of them combining the story of the Ring of the Nibelung with Excalibur. I don't know exactly why authors have so much attraction for medieval tales to mix them with sci-fi stories and witchcraft atmospheres. Well this movie has got an almost perfect combination of those ingredients plus the usual computer made special effects some of them of high quality. As usual the purity of Good is personified by a young boy who has the almost impossible task of fighting the powerful forces of Evil. Summing it up, a well made movie is not the same thing as a good movie.",6,0,0,5 January 2002
Cast Away," A good movie
","This is really a good movie. How close to or how far are we from Stone Age? A man always worried with the pressure of time in this modern world finds himself after a plane crash and within minutes, living in Stone Age conditions in a paradise island that could be advertised by any tourist agency. And time doesn't count anymore now. What counts is survival everyday and the hope to be rescued one day but when?",7,0,0,10 February 2001
The Village," Evasion
","A few people (The Elders) decided to evade this world of crime, anguish and pain and found a community in a secluded place surrounded by woods where they lead a life of peace, purity, love and quietness, dressing like 100 years ago and dispensing with such niceties as electrical power, cinema, radio, TV and motor cars. The way how they managed to get into this remains unrevealed to the viewer until the end of the movie and even then it doesn't become 100% clear. Well but what could be an Eden-like life is spoiled on the one hand by the belief that no one can go out of the village and cross the woods that surround it because they are inhabited by strange hostile creatures who will not only kill those who dare to do it but will also attack the village and on the other hand because human passions cannot be suppressed with all the distress they can cause and even jealousy and crime. This leads us to the vexed question of knowing if the solution for the evils of modern society lie in the evasion to supposed retired paradises where in spite of that, drama will be always present because the freer men are more drama will take place in their lives. And what to do when crime happens or the illness comes and you don't have the adequate means of dealing with it? But this story is indeed well told and homogeneous in narrative terms and will rivet your attention. Bryce Dallas Howard has a superb performance in the part of the blind girl who courageously faces danger in order to save the life of the man she loves. To sum it up we are in presence not of a masterpiece but of a good movie anyway.",7,2,2,10 November 2004
Trouble with the Curve," That's life after all
","Do you like baseball?If you don't, don't worry because this movie is only apparently about baseball. Baseball here is a mere pretext to show life problems and troubles such as about someone who is at risk of losing his job for becoming ill, a lawyer that is endangering her position in a lawyer's firm for losing time in giving too much attention to his ailing father and the difficulties experienced by a young woman in finding a boyfriend. An old baseball scout is losing his eyesight and this puts his job at risk while his thirtyish daughter is very worried about that and wants to be more careful with him against his will since he is rather intractable. This puts her career at risk in the firm she works for because of the time she is losing. Besides that she has difficulty in finding herself a boyfriend (maybe for the same reason)despite the fact that she is very pretty. Father and daughter love each other deeply though very reluctant in showing it. The performers are very good mainly Amy Adams as the daughter who does a superb job. The images and dialogues are particularly revealing of what is going on. The movie is very good in what concerns sentiments, emotions and drama. It could be classified as very good if it were not for the easy, hazardous and random solution found in the end to solve all the problems and troubles.",7,3,3,13 December 2012
Hugo," Cogwheels and pinions may also be beautiful
",And clock machines too. This beautiful movie develops itself in and around a Parisian railway station in the twenties of last century where a small boy named Hugo is in charge of all the station complicated clocks since when his father died. His drunken uncle was the one in charge of that job and when he assumed the boy's guardianship put him to take care of the clocks huge mechanisms while he estranged himself for good to devote himself to drink and laziness. Nobody seemed to take notice of this and the boy could survive alone on petty thefts and some vagrancy. The boy however had an innate talent for mechanics and was trying to repair a strange automaton his father had left and was abandoned in the museum where the latter worked before dying. The boy's petty thefts lead himself to enter in contact with an old man who owned a toy shop (first in bad terms because the old man was also object of the boy's thefts) and his pupil girl approximately the boy's age. Between the two children a friendly relationship takes place and they began an adventurous life together in default of the girl's guardian who later was known to be the famous silent movies maker Georges Méliès who by that time had fallen into oblivion. All this is told in gorgeous images and sceneries reproducing faithfully the epoch in question and many moving scenes till the final climax which is also very moving in sentimental terms. A masterpiece indeed.,8,3,5,1 March 2012
The Shining," Scary indeed
","Well if the best criterion to rate a horror movie as good lies in its power to scare you I must say this movie is scary indeed. I won't exaggerate if I say this is maybe the greatest horror movie I ever saw. The horror here, if you overlook a few ominous ghostly apparitions in human shape some bleeding some not but always in broad light, lies more in the narrated situation developed through a series of scenes all of them well illuminated. As a matter of fact we don't have here the usual dark atmosphere nor lots of vampires, monsters or deformed ghosts. And if the haunted hotel house when seen from outside is sinister indeed all the interior scenes are filmed in broad light and the scenery is shown mostly in light colours contrasting with the omen always present almost from the beginning chiefly through the eyes of the little boy who has got supernatural knowledge powers. That makes it even more terrifying by creating the idea that it could happen to any of us. It's indeed the story of a nice normal couple with a beautiful young son that suddenly becomes a whirl of horror by the power of some hidden evil forces. I must confess I liked the performance of Shelley Duvall in the role of the frightened but courageous young mother better than Nicholson's. Though he is doubtless a great actor and has a good performance here, in the second part of the movie he is a bit too Grand Guignol for the general atmosphere of the movie with too many facial tics and grimaces. I wouldn't like to finish this comment without referring to the last scene of the chase of the boy in the snowy labyrinth which is thrilling indeed. Summing it up, it's an excellent movie with an excellent story (inspired in a Stephen King's novel), very well directed and with an excellent cast and an excellent scenery of interiors with inspired frames.",8,0,0,3 December 2005
"I, Robot"," Revolution
","Though I never had a strong liking for robots and computers which feel and think like human beings I must confess that the logic of this movie seduced me from the beginning. First it's basically a detective story though developing itself in an unusual surroundings, those of sci-fi. And there you can follow a story thread which is solid and plausible enough if you take for granted, or course, those same surroundings which in truth are very well conceived and designed and not shocking at all. Second the background against which the story develops itself is one which is dear to sci-fi: the conflict between human and artificial intelligence and the latter's reach and nature which poses the vexed question of knowing what are intelligence and sentiments made of after all. Can the created thing become equal or even superior to its creator? That's the big question raised in this movie as a matter of fact. In fact what we watch here is a revolution made by robots against their creators. Technically the movie is almost perfect if you allow for the usual physical unlikelihood of several scenes during the sequence of the final fight. The way robots mix up with people in the streets doesn't shock a bit and seems almost natural. One last note: the very last scene of the movie seems to leave much field for personal interpretation by the viewer posing a lot of interrogations about what the above mentioned revolution has brought to mankind after all. Are things going to be in future like they were when the movie began? That's up to you to decide.",7,0,0,8 September 2004
Salt," Totally absurd
","A totally absurd story without rhyme or reason developing itself in a series of not well explained, incredible or even implausible details. A CIA agent (performed by Angelina Jolie) is indicated during his interrogatory at CIA headquarters by a supposed deserter Russian spy as being herself a Russian agent and spy within USA. This leads her to run away and to a series of events full of goofs such as anachronisms, errors in geography, factual errors, plot holes and revealing mistakes. It's rather incredible the physical way how Salt (the CIA woman Russian agent) gets rid of several agents and policemen with whom she involves in physical struggle. The supposed Russian deserter is fake and he is working along with Salt from the beginning so we don't understand why he comes to expose her to CIA as the agent who has the task of killing the Russian Vice-president while in USA when in fact after evading himself violently from CIA custody we see that they are collaborating with each other. We can hardly understand who is with or against whom and why since sometimes some characters' behaviours are contradictory. And why is Salt's husband in danger of being killed by Russian agents since he is just only a scientist who has nothing to do with the film plot? The only positive feature of this movie is the technically well filmed some fights and chasings",5,2,6,4 June 2017
Apocalypse Now," Madness always and everywhere
","In this movie everybody is insane and not only Colonel Kurtz because any war is insane in itself and can only produce insanity. Values are so much degraded that we cannot distinguish between right and wrong anymore. It's the story of a captain who during the Vietnam war is sent on a special mission aimed at killing a former American colonel who went insane and left the army to go into the jungle in Cambodia where he formed a private army with local tribesmen and went on fighting the war on his own making lots of atrocities. Horror is more or less his motto and his obsession. Besides that he is also a poet and a philosopher and this feature of his discourse fits well in his behaviour. The movie develops itself by showing the course of the captain on his way to colonel Kurz's stronghold on a small Navy boat up a river through the jungle. During that course he and the crew of the boat find themselves involved in several happenings showing the true face of war, some violent and some delirious like for instance in the beginning the attack of helicopters against a Vietcong position by the sea, accompanied by Wagner's 'The Valkyria' commanded by a crazy Cavalry colonel insisting of surfing on the sea while bombs explode everywhere around; another delirious scene is when the boat on its course arrives to an army post where there is a musical show for the soldiers performed by a few Playboy bunnies coming from USA who in the end have to seek sudden refuge in the helicopter that had brought them to avoid being molested if not raped. Another curious but full of meaning sequence is when the boat arrives to an old plantation owned by a French family who refuses to leave despite the war. The conversation at dinner between the family members and the captain is rather interesting to follow showing how differently French and Americans faced the war going on there. The movie is well directed and well performed by the whole cast and Marlon Brando as Colonel Kurz who appears only in the end is not better than the rest. Most sequences are really moving and touching and composed by impressive images. Perhaps the only flaw of the movie are the last scenes, a bit too theatrical in relation to its general atmosphere.",8,0,1,18 July 2009
Silver Linings Playbook," Uninteresting enough
","This story of a man diagnosed as bipolar and released from psychiatric internment at a state institution after a few months there which led him to lose his job as teacher and his wife is rather uninteresting though the movie is well made, directed and acted. He was mandatorily interned because he has severely beaten his wife's lover and he was also mandatorily restricted of approaching or contacting her. Then he's got the obsession of recovering job and wife and tries do do it by somewhat awkward means. In the course of this he meets a woman with some psychological troubles also with whom he starts a supposedly friendly relationship since she apparently tries to help him to fulfill his aims. This story is weak, slack and lacks depth. The ending is too predictable to constitute a surprise. A movie to be seen for want of better only.",6,1,3,16 September 2013
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Is this supposed to be funny?
","Well is this movie against pre-marital sex after all? Anyway if it's supposed to be a comedy it should make me laugh which it did only 3 times during the whole projection and even so very mildly. The rest of the time I was bored watching the tribulations of a 40 year old guy who reached the age of 40 without having sex in a time and a society where many people seems to begin having it at 14. We never know why this happened (shyness, impotence, lack of libido or opportunity?). As a counterpoint to that we have to put up with the stupid utterances and dialogues of three nincompoops who are job mates of the virgin and supposedly his counsellors on how he should get deflowered since they are supposed to be sex experts. All the time I was thinking on how this theme could be dealt with by someone with the genius of a Woody Allen for instance, with his intelligent direction, witty dialogues and scenes full of real humour including some portion of subtle eroticism without having to resort all the time to four letter words and explicit sex scenes. Well but since Judd Apatow is no Woody Allen and we cannot ask a thicket to give pears, that's what we have here I mean a movie where except two or three well achieved scenes all the rest is merely so-so.",5,2,5,16 November 2005
Spider-Man," Quite ordinary
",In this kind of Robin Hood of the modern times movies the first place still belongs to Batman since none better has been done since then. The rest is just only special effects today made ordinary by simple computer work. So nothing special to point out in this movie. And the very final scene is totally unnecessary and out of place. It must be dismissed as pure propaganda which has nothing to do with the art of cinema.,6,0,1,30 June 2002
Jarhead," Man's estate
","You are born, grow up, go to school and then instead of going to college you go to a recruitment center to enlist in the marines, become morally and physically subject to the worst and most abject violent acts executed by superiors and comrades upon you, become a marine (a jarhead), are sent to the 'suck' i. e. the war, kill and are killed (or not) and finally come back home (or not) to lead the same meaningless life staying a jarhead on your mind for the rest of your life. That's what this movie is about, that's what it shows us through excellent images, dialogues and monologues. And if the second part appears a bit duller than the first one this is not the fault of the movie it's because marines' lives in the desert during the first Gulf War were dull indeed. Some of them never had the opportunity to let off their guns. Despite lacking some specially dramatic or epic scenes like other war movies, the message it conveys is not less true or effective.",8,1,2,7 February 2006
Shrek Forever After," Splendid as usual
","This animation movie is not better nor worse than the best ones of its kind. But it's splendid indeed in its 3 D version. The images and visual effects are gorgeous, the puppet characters magnificent in their expressions almost human and Shrek himself maintains vivid the idea that unlike the clichés according to which only beautiful is good, ugly can also be good and even an ogre can be virtuous. The story is worth what it's worth being almost a mere pretext of the image show. In this movie the good Shreck becomes tired of domestic life and does the mistake of asking a mischievous sorcerer to put him back for one day in his past life of typical ogre. He pays a high price for this mistake and endangers his way of living which was happy after all, according to the principle that we only value what we have after losing it. We spend more two hours of very pleasant feelings and sensations watching this movie.",8,2,3,24 July 2010
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Fantastic
","Taking the fantasy for granted, it's doubtless that these movies of Harry Potter's saga are indeed and above all, well made. The visual part (special effects, landscapes and the magic of Hogwarts castle interior's) is fascinating. And the stories reveal a limitless and rich imagination that enslaves you. The story of this particular movie is full of spectacular moments, some adventurous and hazardous while others are dazzling and some others humorous but all of them making sense, taking of course the fantasy for granted as we said above. Their rhythm is almost hallucinating. The majority of these wizards (the young ones and the adults) are intrinsically human creatures and behave humanely, displaying humane feelings of love, hate, fear, distaste, friendship and solidarity. The actors and actresses who play their roles, do it in a very efficient and beautiful manner. In short, a movie that in the end leaves you in a good mood.",7,0,1,9 December 2009
Ratatouille," Rats and Men
","In formal and technical terms this movie is undoubtedly very good but not better than the average recent other computer animated movies. Its main original feature is the story itself which tells us about the rat that wants to be a chef and attains its aim after a lot of exciting vicissitudes. This movie has the successful peculiarity of making the viewer to take to the rats which are animals we are used to face as repugnant, distasteful and disease-carrier mainly in what relates with food. But here we sympathize with them indeed. Getting back to technical aspects, the design is stupendous, the puppets extremely original and expressive, the action runs at a sometimes hallucinating rhythm and the visual effects are of an amazing movement and perspective. This is one more excellent achievement in the field of animation movies.",7,1,3,6 September 2007
Gandhi," Glamorous and epic
","This biography of one of the greatest men of 20th century (for many even perhaps the greatest) is presented with the smooth but firm hand of Richard Attenborough showing here and there great dramatic moments of the life of the main character who is somewhat glamorous in his humility and modesty but also truly epic as the great hero he truly was. And the message passes through, of a life entirely dedicated to non-violent fighting for such noble causes as anti-racial discrimination and the right of all peoples to self-determination. His fight begins in pre-apartheid South Africa where nevertheless the roots of apartheid were already visible and continues in India for the independence of the country. There the story of his life mixes itself with the history of India. After defeating the British with his non-violent resistance deeds he faces another harsh trial: the rivalry between Muslims and Hindus which soon turns into violent hatred. He never wanted the former British colony to be divided between the two communities. By enduring a second hunger strike he tried to put an end to violence between them. He also fought against the division of Hindu society in castes. For him all men were equal regardless of race, colour or social status. He ended by being murdered by a fanatic Hindu when he was preparing himself to travel to Pakistan in order to reach reconciliation between both communities. The movie shows all these episodes with great realism and visual efficiency and the cast is formed by great players with special prominence of Ben Kingsley in the role of Gandhi. The ideas of the Mahatma were well and clearly expressed in the dialogues where he took part particularly when he had to talk with British authorities where his purposes were sharply and courageously exposed. This movie does a great service to Gnadhi's message and ideas.",8,0,1,7 February 2009
American History X," Too superficial
","Nazism, fascism or neo-Nazism and neo-fascism got multiple causes. Besides the individual personal psychological ones that turn a human being into a Nazi or a Fascist there are the collective social, economic and political ones which give birth to the movements where the individuals integrate themselves. Without the latter causes the former will be socially ineffective. Therefore the racial problem in USA cannot be treated with this simplicity because it's much more complex than what is shown in this movie. This movie is more about personal motives that make one to become a neo-Nazi even if they assume a form of a certain interpretation of social and economic realities usually a wrong one. It doesn't say practically anything about what is most important i. e. the roots of racism as a global social phenomenon. Without it you cannot understand this question. Of course you can tell me now that the movie doesn't intend to be a sociological treatise and just only to tell us a certain story. Well that may be true but then the movie is worth what it's worth regarding the theme of racism that is subjacent to it. This is undoubtedly an honest movie that tells us the credible story of a young neo-Nazi who repents himself of that, after having been in jail convicted for racial homicide and then tries to prevent his younger brother to follow the same path. But the story is told in a too superficial and not very deep way. It doesn't touch the core of the racial question. In respect to that we have only the discussion at the family table in the first part of the movie among the family members including the Jewish boyfriend of the young man's mother, which discussion ends in a bad way. The rest of the movie loses itself, besides the inevitable violent scenes, in some somewhat ingenuous sentimental ones, lacking intensity. In sum this is a sincere and just movie but not particularly remarkable.",6,1,4,18 May 2006
Ocean's Eleven," Thief who robs thief
","This is maybe the best hold-up movie I've ever seen. The plot including the hold-up planning, is not very detailed to avoid holes, feeble points and illogical situations. But its execution is made with clockwork precision. The first part of the movie is a bit tedious with the narration of the plan for the hold-up and its preparation but the second part has a lot of suspense and reserves several good surprises to the viewer including the end. The acting is excellent and serves the plot very well. And last but not least there is a moving romantic touch concerning the relationship between the chief crook and his ex-wife now dating the owner of the held-up casino. We finish to sympathize with the crooks and consider the owner of the casino the villain.  As a Portuguese proverb says: a thief who robs a thief has a 100 years pardon.",7,0,1,12 January 2002
Tropic Thunder," Besides bombastic scenes there is nothing
",This movie is supposed to be a comedy but it is not funny at all. In fact I never laughed during the whole vision. Besides the bombastic scenes and images and the usual special effects it is a succession of stupid and meaningless episodes and dialogues of a story that can be summed up in few words: A team of actors (!!??) is in Vietnam to film an episode of the war which had occurred there. They are dispersed here and there in the middle of the jungle engaging in interminable discussions and arguments among themselves about this and that inclusive because some of them don't want to stay in the film anymore and want to go away. Some of them end up by being captured by a ridiculous gang of local drug producers and traffickers. Intermingled with this there are scenes back in USA with discussions and insults among the members of the movie team of producers and directors all in appallingly mean language. A movie to forget in all senses.,4,1,4,4 July 2015
No Country for Old Men," Violence and murder are the main protagonists
","Of course there is a plot but a weak one on purpose, to stress the violence and murder galore, some of them very gratuitous like it happens almost daily in that country where the movie was made, a country no good for old men (and not for young ones either). We are told the story of a bag of money and drug dealers by the Mexico - USA border but not much details are given about who the bosses are and the way the business takes. In this context the movie is well made and well acted. The Coen brothers always had a special predilection for anti-heroes like those here performed by Tommy Lee Jones the old but very wise sheriff and Kelly Macdonald the wife of the man who tries to run away with the money while chased by Javier Bardem (the psychopath killer). These both characters are the more balanced ones, the more 'normal' if we can say so. The end of the movie (if it can be called a true end) proves what I said above i. e. that the plot is secondary here, just only a conducting thread of the various scenes and sequences. But this is a good movie in the genre, well directed and well acted in every detail like the Coen brothers have already accustomed us.",7,0,3,23 April 2008
District 9," Interesting enough
",An unusual fiction movie story. A star ship from another planet comes above earth and stands above Johannesburg. Aboard there are hundreds (or thousands) of aliens not on a very good physical shape who are taken off and installed on a closed camp on the outskirts called District 9. These aliens' figures are conceived as half human half insects but their images are extremely well conceived in visual terms and with great and good fancy imagination. And they have an almost human behaviour. However after more than 20 years their relationship with the local inhabitants begins to degrade itself and the supervising department of the alien population decides that they must be evicted to a camp a few hundreds of miles away from the city. It's when the situation becomes complicated first because of the aliens' resistance to eviction and then because the man appointed as the operation chief becomes contaminated with a fluid that begins to transform him into an alien which leads to make him almost as a danger for the human community being treated and chased as so. This could be a good movie of this kind if it weren't for some not well explained images and sequences even in terms of fiction that we could then take for granted. Anyway it's a movie interesting enough to be seen.,6,0,1,18 October 2015
Toy Story 4," Not bad
","Well yes the puppet toys figures are well conceived, shaped and acted like human beings. The story is thrilling enough and easy to follow and relative to the affectionate dependence that toys have to their children owners. It is about the problem that arise from the fact that when children get older they lose interest in their old toys. However I think it was bad taste to show a 'human' toy torn by a cat though he remains alive. A movie that can be seen both by children and adults.",6,0,3,4 July 2019
To Rome With Love," Only apparently superficial
","Woody Allen is a movie director who has a deeply knowledge of modern urban life (his more significant films take place in New York, London, Paris, Barcelona and now Rome) in its various aspects mainly those concerned with human relations namely in what refers to love and the several ways it reveals itself including sex. His movies are only apparently superficial. Behind the good humour with which they are made we often find also drama and frustration. And romanticism is almost always present though not in a very patent image. Besides being charming in terms of images of beautiful Rome, this movie tells us several crossed stories that have to do with the idiosyncrasies of present society mainly one that the story shows admirably: the illusion of the social and with media coverage fame that has its example in the office clerk who becomes suddenly famous without knowing why and with all the inherent public homages and reverences and also the undertaker who sings well opera but only in the shower. These are obviously social caricatures but well presented and performed. On the other hand we have the love relations in the three young couples with the interference of a third party in two cases (the seductive pseudo-intellectual girl in one of them and the fine hotel whore and the famous movie actor in the other). This gives way to a lot of excellent gags and funny situations but which have to do with real sentiments and their realistic evolutions sometimes unexpected but acceptable in terms of psychological reactions. All this i. e. images, scenes, stories, the performers's work and the gags, everything treated, related and shown with great skill make this movie one of the best in the current year",8,2,6,23 September 2012
The Pianist," Victim and witness
",The first part of the movie shows us a vivid image of the horror of Nazi domination in Poland particularly in Warsaw and especially over the Jewish people object of daily violence and humiliation. We are spared nothing of the sheer brutality of those butchers and the reproduction of several aspects of everyday life in the occupied city is shown in a very realistic and convincing way. In the second part the protagonist (a renowned Jewish pianist) without ceasing to be a victim manages by hiding himself until the end of the occupation and thus becomes also a terrified witness of all the events which took place in Warsaw between 1942 and 1945 namely the ghetto and the city uprisings and finally its liberation by the Red Army. He owes his survival after all not only to good luck but also to the help of friends and foes with human feelings namely a member of the Jewish police created by the Nazis and a German officer who listens to him playing piano for the first time after the beginning of his ordeal. This is a climax scene which will make you swallow a lump in your throat out of emotion while watching it. It's a scene which will remain in the History of Cinema. This is more a realistic movie than a pathetic one though it has got enough pathos to arouse your deepest emotion.,7,0,0,24 February 2003
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Just passable
","This story of a mother dinosaur going mad at humans because of the abduction of its young... Well but let's begin at the beginning. Two teams of men are sent to an island not far from Costa Rica inhabited by several species of dinosaurs that Man re-created there (how, when and with what purpose?) to (study them? make some kind of research? hunt them? All the three?). There began at once a fierce fight between predator dinosaurs and men (the worst predators in Earth after all) in a series of thrilling episodes and scenes full of suspense most of them very implausible (even taking for granted the presence of dinosaurs as natural and real). That is to say we have here another action thriller of a fight between men and more or less fantastic predators not worse and not better than lots of other movies of the same kind. A word of praise however, for the dinosaur special effects which are technically very well made and quite convincing in visual terms.",5,2,5,17 May 2009
City of God," Realistic indeed
","This is the story of the fight between two gangs for the control of a 'favela' called 'Cidade de Deus' (City of God) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The story develops against a background of poverty, squalor and lawlessness where the values which are obeyed are those imposed by the gangs. We see even children possessing and using guns, killing and robbing at ease. The images are extremely realistic and the cast without exception does a superb performance. The cut was made in syncopated scenes with lots of short flashbacks with the intention of conferring a vivid rhythm to the movie but revealing themselves sometimes excessive. The dialogues are also very realistic and full of strength. A good movie almost a masterpiece of its kind.",7,0,1,8 January 2006
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," An Oriental Excalibur
","Beautiful people, beautiful landscapes, beautiful scenery, beautiful houses, beautiful sets, beautiful decoration, beautiful adventures. People flying like feathers in the wind. Fighting scenes more like balletic figures than real fights. A gorgeous movie to fill your eye. And the story? Well the story is a bit poor I mean it is already very often seen. The eternal fight between good and evil, a kind of oriental version of Excalibur, the legendary sword of King Arthur. But it has got enough romance to keep you interested in it. So forget about the story and enjoy the images.",7,0,0,1 May 2001
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," No acceptable plot no leading thread
","I like a movie with a good built story, an acceptable plot, a leading thread and a final good or bad climax. This movie has neither of them. It shows a succession of stories, episodes and scenes although with the same characters but dispersed and weakly linked. Those parts may be well acted and directed anyway. The story is about several facts, happenings and events of the lives of a TV actor and his stunt in past century sixties. Not particularly interesting nor thrilling.",6,1,4,19 August 2019
Gone Girl," A complicated story
",Complicated but well told. Nick and Amy started a love marriage between themselves which lasts 2 years before becoming disharmonious. On the day of the marriage 5th anniversary Amy disappears leaving behind her a scene that suggested she could have been violently kidnapped. This is object of a criminal investigation by the police during which several odd aspects of their marriage are revealed including Nick's infidelity with a young girl. The investigation leads to a murder suspicion falling upon Nick. But from a certain moment on the movie unfolds itself in two alternate sequences in a vivid rhythm: one around Nick and the investigation and the other one around Emy that is alive and running away to disappear and revenge herself by creating a scenery that would lead to Nick's conviction for her supposed murder. This is well told in images and dialogues and has good dramatic scenes and ends up more or less suddenly with a real murder committed by Amy on a former lover which she misrepresents as legitimate defence of a sexual assault. This changes her revenge course and the movie ends with them back together though not in a very harmonious mood. Not a very good ending according to normal moral patterns but this is a movie and not a moral lesson. Not a masterpiece but a movie worth to be seen anyway.,7,1,10,20 October 2014
Django Unchained," Black hero
","First of all I wish to say that if the shooting of the horse at the beginning is real and not simulated or feigned this would mean cruelty against animals which is a crime and you must forget what I am going to comment below because then the movie should be utterly condemned. When Quentin Tarantino was interviewed after he made this movie the interviewer asked him if he didn't think that his movies had too much violence. Tarantino replied, rather irritated, that society is much more violent. And he was utterly right of course. This movie has violence galore and lots of blood. But this violence is totally acceptable as real in the context of the story and you must not forget that slavery was in itself and in its daily events a constant huge violence. This is the story of a man who makes a living by being a bounty hunter (he killed bandits hunted up and down by justice to get the reward offered to whom delivered them dead or alive) who at a certain point takes as his assistant a slave called Django (Jamie Foxx who does a fine job at this part) freeing him after he helped him to find three of those bandits. After that the body hunter who was in fact a fine cultivated gentleman with some humane feelings (though trigger happy) decides to help Django to find his wife, another slave from whom he was forcibly separated in a slave auction. This leads them to a series of thrilling adventures very well shown in images, scenes, sequences and dialogues, showing a cast of very well depicted and presented characters with great performers. The sceneries, both interior and exterior, are excellent. Of course in this kind of movies there are also a few actual unlikelihoods (for instance the facility with which the shooter hits fully and precisely very distant targets which anyone who has for instance done military duties knows it is very difficult if not impossible and the facility with which the 'goody' hero kills a crowd of villains supposedly as good shooters as himself and without even being hit himself). But in its whole it is a good movie indeed in terms of action, sceneries, cut, actors' direction and performing and screen-play carrying out with extremely dramatic scenes.",7,1,4,13 February 2013
Get Out," Crazy strange movie
","Where we don't know exactly why people do such strange things. The love-making between Rose, a white girl and Chris, a black man, turns out on a visit for a weekend stay at her parents home. On arriving there he is nicely received by them looking like they were not at all racists like the girl had already told to her boyfriend. The following day there was a party there with the presence of a lot of more or less aristocratic guests. However Chris begins to feel that something is wrong with those people and suddenly decides to go back home. Rose reluctantly seems to agree with him. However, after the guests went away the atmosphere changes a lot and what looked like a romantic movie changes into a doleful black one with all the family acting against Chris to do a brain transplant since Rose's father is a neurologic surgeon and uses to do some strange experiences on black men. The movie ends with Chris killing them all and escaping with the help of his friend Rod who was trying to find him and finally succeeded in getting there where he was. A strange story not utterly convincing.",6,0,3,16 January 2020
X-Men: The Last Stand," Gorgeous visual effects
","When I was a kid fairy tales had fairies, witches, wizards, gnomes, dwarfs, magic wands and fantastic castles or palaces. Now they have mutants, monsters, heroes, politicians, presidents, superpowers, explosions and violence galore. Well but this movie curiously combines odd people dressed in normal clothes (with a few exceptions) circulating in normal streets with normal buildings inside and outside normally decorated and normal vehicles passing around. Despite that the movie has got some of the greatest visual effects ever seen on the screen. We are here in the presence of a society composed of humans and mutants endowed with superpowers both physical and mental. Apparently those mutants are assimilated in American society (the movie takes place only in USA and we don't know what happens in other countries) but when a medicine is discovered that can 'cure' them that is deprive them of their superpowers and sometimes peculiar appearances and make them 'normal' human beings, then, while some of them resort to democratic peaceful street demonstrations, some others form a brotherhood that opts to resist violently starting a war against established powers and authorities to seize and destroy the source of that medicine. In the fight that ensues a handful of 'good' mutants side with the established powers against their fellow creatures. The final battle in my opinion is the weakest part of the movie even in terms of visual effects not rising above of lots of other similar scenes already seen in alike movies. There are also a few logical flaws like for instance the fact of one of the most powerful mutants going on a wheelchair instead of putting himself to walk normally being true that he could do much more difficult supernatural things. Love is also present mainly in the relationship between one of the 'good' mutants and a mutant young girl endowed with the most powerful superpowers. A goody movie after all.",6,0,1,7 June 2006
Good Will Hunting," Incredible but authentic
","This is the incredible story of Will a working class young boy who besides working as a janitor first and in the building construction afterwards, is also a genius in mathematics and several other scientific fields which he learned all by himself. But simultaneously he is a petty delinquent for which he has already got a criminal record mainly for assaulting other people in street fights with the likes of him. Despite being a real genius he is also an insecure boy fearing life and love due to the very unhappy childhood he had, which makes it very hard that he can take advantage of his intellectual ability. It also leads him to be rude to those who want to help him since he doesn't trust anybody. All through the movie we see the work of the two men who try to bring him to life and to take conscience of his own value: a maths professor and above all a psychiatrist who had his own problems in life too. This is shown in a brilliant way in terms of players' performances, images and dialogues with deep analysis of feelings and behaviours. All the players are excellent. A special reference to Minnie Driver as the boy's girlfriend with her spiritual and intelligent look and her moving reactions to some of Will's difficult to understand attitudes. This story is genuine indeed in terms of sentiments and actions and very well put on film. One of the best movies of its year.",8,0,2,10 February 2006
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Beautiful scenes but a somewhat incredible story
","I still remember the version of 1947 of this story with Danny Kaye and it is much funnier than this one. This is the story of an ordinary man who has got an ordinary job but who is a daydreamer engaging himself in extraordinary and sometimes terrible imaginary adventures in which he is a great hero. However for a certain moment on he's got a problem at work which forces him to engage in extraordinary unbelievable adventures in the real world which take him to such places as Greenland, Iceland and the Hymalaias in a short time so short that makes it also unbelievable as real. It could be accepted if it was object of his usual daydreaming. This is the weakest part of the movie. But the movie has got superb beautiful scenes and landscape visuals of those distant countries and regions which make its best part. If you are going to see this movie it will entertain you a bit anyway.",6,0,3,11 January 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Brave Old World
","In a totally fictitious Middle Ages, peopled by men, elves,monsters, dwarfs, moving trees and other more or less strange beings, another episode of the eternal struggle between Good and Evil unfolds itself in a succession of fantasy and dream sceneries where terror and poetry combine in a fantastic symbiosis. On the other hand some dialogues and monologues as well as some characters reach an almost Shakespearean grandeur. This movie has some images of rare beauty and some others which fill us with awe and wonder. And what about the story? Well the story is the weakest part of all this with the usual plot flaws and a lot of unlikely facilities in the outcome of certain plot scenes about which I will not dwell now to avoid being a spoiler. But who cares after all? The usual spectator of this kind of movies only wants to be recreated during the projection time and devoted to all the emotions that the various incidents produce in his mind. It's therefore intrinsically one more movie aimed at entertaining the spectator and not at making him think or at conveying any message beyond the simple one according to which Good must always triumph over Evil.",6,0,0,14 January 2003
The Incredibles," No progress
","In my opinion this movie represents no progress in the history of modern animation movies in which computer technique replaced drawing technique. This story could be made and told with real actors instead of animated characters. In fact we don't see here any anthropomorphic animals, fairies or witches just only normal people living in a city of the present times though some of them endowed with supernatural powers whose origin is never revealed. No poetry or lyricism either just only adventure and violent fighting with the usual common special effects computers can produce even in movies performed by real players. But even these effects are not especially creative or more original than those we have seen in a lot of other recent animation movies. Do the people who made this movie think that animated characters can portray human emotions or feelings than human actors whatever the former's facial expressions and bodily movements may look human? When they are well done we like them just because they seem human and not because they are better expressed then by real actors and actresses. Of course the only advantage is that animated characters can be 100% shaped by his creator in a way that no movie director can make with human players who always have their own personalities. But this is precisely what we like to see: a human player putting in the acting something of his or her own personality and not acting like a created robot. Well for those who like this kind of movie they won't be disappointed after all since the movie has got enough action and enough thrilling scenes to make it fairly enjoyable.",6,3,7,22 December 2004
Cars 2," Stunning
","An animation movie is worth what's worth that's all. But this one has a whirl of stunning images and scenes technically almost perfect and extremely efficient and impressive. The humanized cars are greatly expressive in terms of 'facial' and 'body' features and gestures that make us always forget they aren't people. Their movements look human indeed. And we don't see a single human being all through the movie as if the world was peopled with cars behaving like people and showing human feelings and thoughts, some of them being the 'bad' and some others the 'good' ones. There also several good humoured sequences like those performed by the tow van character, a really well conceived one. And the reproduction of cities like Paris, London and Italy are very realistic and beautiful almost looking like photos. And the story? Well the story the less important aspect of the movie as it often happens in animation movies. Something about the use of car fuel, the very modern duel between petrol and alternative less polluting fuels which in this story involve a fight between the 'goodies' who defend the former against the 'baddies' that try to discredit it in favour of petrol by means of several criminal and violent actions. If you go to see this movie you'll spend a pleasant time having a visual very effective entertainment",7,1,2,28 July 2011
Call Me by Your Name," Not too bad
",But not too good either. It is the simply sentimental story not too deeply analysed of a love homosexual relationship between a teenager boy and a 24 year old college graduate that came to northern Italy where the boy's family lives to help in cultural historic research by the boy's father. The boy is a bit immature since he also flirts with a girl his age. The story develops itself in physical contact scenes and short dialogues and sentences not deep enough too explain thoroughly in psychological terms how the homosexual relationship has started. Too ambitious movie though not very well directed.,6,4,7,9 February 2020
Gran Torino," Human relations
","This movie is indeed about human relations the bad and the good ones in the American mid-west and among ethnic different people. The story is a simply one rather well shown and told but not particularly deep in psychological terms.
A widower Korean War veteran lives alone in a neighbourhood that is now inhabited only by Asians. In the house next to him there is a family whose young boy Thao is harassed and bullyed by a gang of other youg Asians. Walt Kowalski, our war veteran begins to react rudely and uncongenially to these neighbours but after an unhappy incident created by the young Thao he changes his attitude and starts a friendly relationship with Thao and his family and tries even to protect them against the gang above and takes revenge against them. His relations with his two sons are not good and he has got a cancer which puts him in a poor health state.

Shrek the Third," The ogre rides again
","For the third time we have the pleasant company of the ogre, the princess Fiona and friends such as the Donkey and Puss in Boots. The visual part has the same excellent quality of the first two movies, the cartoons and the puppets are great indeed mainly in their very expressive look and the scenes of landscapes, towns and palace interiors are gorgeous. The animation is also very good. Only the story is somewhat weaker than in the two previous versions being a little less interesting maybe because of the 'déjà vu' effect which makes it a little short of originality. But the main idea behind this story is the same of the other two: that ugly can be beautiful and doesn't need to go always with evil.",6,0,1,11 July 2007
Moulin Rouge!," Again the story of Traviata
",Those who think that the era of the great musicals is over will see their opinion denied by this movie which combines the old musical tradition with a lot of digital special effects more adequate to the animation movies but which match with the general purpose of this movie anyway. The editing mainly in the first part shows an overwhelming speed of successive plans almost psychedelic playing successfully with images and sounds and showing spectacular choreographic scenes. In the second part that image rhythm slows down a bit more accordingly with the dramatic plot that develops itself around a Traviata love story of the tb ridden courtisan and the young poor but talented writer. Near the end there is a fabulous musical dance with an Argentinian theme which makes counterpoint with the dramatic scene where the courtisan is going to sacrifice herself to the lust of the rich Duke who is financially supporting the show. The weakest part of the movie is the soundtrack mostly made of more modern melodies like 'The Sound of Music' which have nothing to do with the movie supposed era. Their inclusion results in an anachronism which we cannot understand. This movie could be better but is good enough anyway.,7,0,1,7 October 2001
X-Men: Apocalypse," Fanciful indeed
","In what concerns special effects it is the most stunning movie I have ever seen and only for that it is worth to be seen. Scene succeeds scene in hallucinating speed. In a society where humans live together with mutants not always in very friendly terms, the first mutant is awaken after thousands of years (he was worshiped as a god in Ancient Egypt where the movie starts) and seeing that the world is not good he decides to destroy it to create a new society and a new world order above which he would reign. Then a group of young X-Men (boys and girls) start a fight against his purpose in order to save mankind from destruction. This struggle unites humans and also a few mutants who have extraordinary superpowers they use in the amazing scenes above referred. A movie that keeps you rooted to your seat from the first to the last image.",7,15,24,22 June 2016
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Odd and beautiful
","This odd story of a man who lives his life in reverse (i. e. from old age to babyhood) is told in a such natural way that we accept it as real. The movie is about the dichotomy between life and death, youth and old age, present and past, time and space, comedy and drama. The images are beautiful, the sound track music is wonderful and the characters move themselves, behave and talk with great delicacy and fineness in an almost poetical universe making us feel the huge drama hidden inside it. It also passes the message that love is such a powerful feeling that it can overcome all contrarieties and fatalities. All the players do a marvellous job making us feel intensively their dramatic roles. As outstanding we can mention Brad Pitt (Benjamin), Cate Blanchett (Daisy), Taraji P. Henson (Queenie) and Jared Harris (Captain Mike). This is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the last ten years.",8,0,1,25 January 2009
Men in Black II," Another one
","Of this computer made movies with lots of the usual action and thrilling scenes and images. But the visual and animation effects are spectacular and very well succeeded. The gags are also very funny indeed. The talking dog is particularly hilarious. Of course this is a sci-fi comedy, one of the best made till then but no more than that I mean the story is banal despite the attempt of introducing a sentimental sub-plot there which is fairly attractive anyway. But the action is really fascinating and can delight you during the whole view. A special mention also to the extraterrestrial animated characters which are very well conceived in terms of originality and inventiveness.",6,0,0,14 April 2010
1917," Epic and overwhelming
","And filmed as one shot which means that the action time is almost the same as the projection one. The story is simple but very exciting. In World Wat I it happened that two British soldiers in France are assigned by their general to deliver a message to the colonel commander of a battalion a few miles away who is planning an attack to German positions to profit from German army withdrawal. However this message urges the colonel to stop the attack since the supposed withdrawal of German forces is feigned and intends no more than attracting the British troops to a trap where 1,600 British would be killed. This message is needed because the phone lines had been cut by the Germans. The two men must cross a no man's land to get to the Colonel's battalion. During their journey they are fired at more than once by dispersed German soldiers and that is filmed and shown in admirable images and sequences using often great plans in every detail. The actor's performance is also great. One of the best movies of 2019.",9,5,8,4 February 2020
Lincoln," Bad means for a good cause
","This movie is not a biography of Abraham Lincoln. It elapses only during the last years of his life in the course of the Civil War and the political fight to obtain the approval of the 13th amendment to the Constitution which would end up slavery. The 2/3 majority necessary to reach that approval in the House of Representatives is finally got through bribery and corruption of the marginal few members still needed to make those 2/3 and that is widely shown in the movie through a succession of scenes and sequences of confrontation between partisans and adversaries of the amendment. Bad means for a just cause of course. These scenes, dialogues, speeches, disputes and discussions are shown with great realism and force and occupy the largest part of the movie which leads some viewers to consider that part very dull. On the contrary I think they are very important to make us understand what is really going on and are also well shown and acted. Of course the real motives for the north to wage a war against the south were not so humanitarian (notwithstanding President Lincoln's humanitarian personal motives). We don't see easily that the Federals would wage such a bloody war against the Confederates with the sole purpose of getting the slaves emancipated in the south. There were economical motives behind it such as the competition between the industrial north and the agricultural south whose advantage was precisely the cheap slave labour which had then to be suppressed to enhance northern economic superiority. The performance of Daniel Day-Lewis as Lincoln is wonderful, one of the best movie performances I have ever seen. All the other performers do their job very well and are extremely well chosen and made up. All the sceneries, dresses and attires create a real and true atmosphere of the epoch. It is undoubtedly one of the best 2012 movies.",8,0,1,26 February 2013
Million Dollar Baby," Is this moving really about boxing?
","I must begin by confessing that I hate boxing. So I'll make this comment notwithstanding that. Well but is this movie really about boxing? I don't think so, I mean, in my opinion boxing is here a mere pretext to tell a story about love, friendship, dedication, will strength and fighting spirit for an aim. The main character is a boxer by chance as she could be a soccer player, a singer, a dancer or a pianist. And this is also the story of a false hard hearted guy who loses a daughter and meets another to whom he can give his fatherly love and get it returned. This movie is made with a, shall we say, atrocious realism both visual and psychological and the acting performers do their best to express it. The outcome, though caused by a fortuitous (or not?) fact, inserts itself totally in the atmosphere created by the two main characters (or three if we consider that the old ex-boxer is also a catalyst of the whole process of events, playing a fundamental part in the consciousness of the other two and acting somehow like their counterpoint). I think we are perhaps in presence of one of the best 2004 movies if not the best one.",8,1,2,17 March 2005
Donnie Brasco," A tough movie
","This is the story of a New York Mafia gang and some of its members viewed from the inside, plus the story of a FBI agent who manages to infiltrate himself in the gang through the good offices of a petty member of it whose role is performed by Al Pacino in which was maybe the best performance of his career. There is of course a lot of bloodshed since the lives of those men are torn between to kill or be killed. It's also a story about human nature featured by the strange friendship that arises between the infiltrated agent(who has sometimes to behave like one of the so called 'wise men' of the Mafia gang) and the member who acts as his 'protector' and also featured by the familiar problems of these two prominent characters;for the infiltrated agent (performed by Johnny Depp) because he has got to stay out of home for long periods which annoys his wife very much and even puts his marriage at risk; for the petty Mafia member because he has severe problems with his son who is a drug addict. The second half of the movie is somewhat weaker than the first one since it's more about the conspiracies of the gang and the ensuing gunfights and killings than about the psychological analysis of characters shown through their actions and words. Anyway it's still a good movie, well directed and well acted by everyone.",7,0,0,25 June 2009
Mulholland Drive," Interacting with the spectator
","In this movie David Lynch follows the same path that gave us 'Twin Peaks' or 'Lost Highway' with the same criss-cross pattern of appearance and reality, dream (sometimes nightmare) and verity, sanity and madness, humour and drama, sentiment and coldness. But the atmosphere in 'Lost Highway' was much more consistent and dense than here, keeping us all the time stuck to our seats in awe and suspense during the whole projection. This movie although made with talent, shows some weak points and some gaps in the story structure and in the criss-cross combination of several stories and possible clues of the plot. As usual in most of Lynch's movies the plot which requires the spectator's complicity to get to a possible solution that he himself can chose and discover in some kind of interaction. Lynch's talent is also present in the slow camera travellings in which it acts like one more character, accompanied by a terrific and obsessingly oppressive sound track making apparently harmless scenes appearing ominous. This style that consists in telling a story in which the conducting thread loses itself and is here and there broken in episodes that seem to have no relation to it, coming to the extreme of an almost complete rupture like it happens here in the last scenes of the movie, has much to do with the technique of the French school of the 'nouveau roman' in which each scene has its own value and meaning leaving its interpretation and integration in the global plot to the reader. In short, I think that Lynch doesn't keep in this movie the density of his previous movies but even so it's worth to be seen.",7,1,2,7 May 2004
Brave," Better is difficult
","This animation movie reaches the top of its kind not only in technical terms (images, movements, scenes, landscapes, special effects, characters' human-like expressions) but also in terms of contents (a good touching story of good values). We almost forget we are watching an animation movie at some moments. The character of Merida the young rebel princess is very well conceived and designed and it's also morally convincing. In visual terms it is sometimes delirious and overwhelming and it's very well proportioned in terms of comedy, drama, action, poetry and angles of vision. An excellent movie not only for children but also for grownups",8,3,5,5 September 2012
The Imitation Game," Passionate
","This movie shows two plot trends: one is the runnning against time to discover the secret code of the Nazi militar messages led by a group of cryptoanalysts during WWII under the direction of Alan Turing, a brilliant mathematician and the other is the latter's dramatic life and feelings as an homossexual at a time when that behaviour was a crime in Great Britain and for which he is later convicted. His success at that cryptoanalysis work is kept secret which prevents him to be recognized as a hero who has largely contributed to shorten the war time and thus saving millions of lives. Besides that he is always being harassed by his superiors to deliver quickly that code decipherment. By the way this story is based on real events.
The movie shows all this in detail in a way that passionates the viewers in terms of good cinema direction and acting performance.",8,0,0,4 March 2018
8 Mile," Do you like rap music?
","You needn't to to appreciate this movie that makes you go deep into the world of rap like it's practiced and lived by the youths in the poor neighbourhoods, slums and trailers of Detroit mostly inhabited by Afro-Americans but also by some whites, all of those youngsters living together without showing any serious racist attitudes. This is also half biographical of Eminem the greatest rapper ever known and who does the main character in the movie. It's a very realistic movie showing the vivid relations between all those rap performers and fans and the contest rap battles they are involved in, trying to win a place in the sun which means to get a possible contract with a radio station or a record editor. These relations are sometimes very friendly and solidary sometimes antagonistic and violent. Besides this we have the depiction of the difficult relationship between the young rapper whose role is played by Eminem and his mother whose behaviour is not very orthodox, while at same time he cherishes and tries to protect his little sister. The dialogues are very realistic too in terms of corresponding to the real language that these youths use to express themselves. Though not a masterpiece (the script matter doesn't allow more anyhow) this is a movie worth to be seen chiefly by the authenticity of its scenes, by its music (for rap lovers) and by the great performance of the cast.",7,0,0,5 July 2009
Shrek 2," Ugly is beautiful
","There they are again the ogre, the princess and the donkey now in the company of another nice character the Pussy in Boots. And here once more some myths and values are upside down with the ogre being again the good one and the Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming the wicked ones. A great portion of good humour is added to the story with some very hilarious gags and wink giving at some of our consumers' society values such as TV and pop music shows. The images and sceneries are almost perfect in terms of animations and the characters are very expressive in their bodily and face movements. But the main feature of the movie is perhaps that against the grain of the usual values in child stories that identify beauty with kindness and ugliness with wickedness, it shows the viewers mainly the children, that these realities don't necessarily go together. Unfortunately I cannot say anything about the voices of great movie stars lent to the characters because I have seen a Portuguese version with Portuguese actors' voices who made an excellent dubbing anyway.",7,0,0,21 July 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Poetical violence
",This is a well made movie (which is not necessarily the same thing as a good movie). In fact this movie is very well directed by Tarantino's usual iron hand in a succession of violent scenes some of them curiously impregnated by a poetical atmosphere revealed not only in the scenery that frames them but also by the excellent music and songs conveyed by the sound track which at times has moments of great lyricism. Most sequences pay visual tribute to Japanese cartoons and the movie contains itself some sequences made up actually by cartoons in that style. If we take for granted the usually unplausible scenes in this kind of movies (e. g. the heroin coming of a coma and recovering almost at once all her physical fighting strength) we'll appreciate the firm way by which this movie is made and will become fascinated by its exciting atmosphere. There is a small flaw in the plot consisting in the lack of a quite understandable explanation for the attempted killing of the heroin at her wedding ceremony as well as for the actual killing of all the other people there. Since she was herself a killer maybe it was a squaring of accounts within the gang. Anyway this detail is not very important. Well some people might say that this movie purports a lot of gratuitous violence. Yes this may be true but if we read the daily papers or watch TV news bulletins don't we hear about lots of this kind of violence performed everyday in real life? Hasn't someone already said that mankind is creating a society of monsters with its consumerist values? Do these movies impel people towards crime and violence more than society does or on the contrary they arouse in most people a strong aversion for violent behaviour? This is a vexed question for psychologists and sociologists to solve. Anyway personally I'm against all forms of violence and I never said this was or wasn't a good movie. But I reaffirm that in pure formal terms (disregarding its content) it's a well made movie. And one more remarkable feature: this is a feminist movie in a certain sense. In fact I can't remember seeing a violent movie where women's roles are so much more important than men's like in this one.,7,0,1,14 November 2003
World Trade Center," The massacre of the innocents
","Oliver Stone carefully avoided to make of this movie a political pamphlet. It's only a sample story of how a mad and criminal act (supposedly committed in the name of a good cause) may affect the lives of a lot of innocent people and their families in a terrible tragic and dramatic way. But it's also a story of solidarity and of how people can put themselves at the service of others in moments of danger even at the risk of their own lives. The attack to the WTC that was supposed to hit USA as a global political and military target ended by killing, maiming and wounding thousands of peaceful citizens of several countries and also American civilians of several origins (Afro, Spanish, Portuguese, Scottish and others). That's the main message the movie conveys to us. Besides that we also can see how sometimes the psychological strain felt by the families of the victims can make family ties to become stronger and even enhance love between man and wife. The way the story is told and shown has no flaws or unlikelihood scenes and the visual narration is sufficiently pathetic. The acting or the performers is also good enough.",7,2,5,27 September 2006
Black Hawk Down," War
","This movie is not about which side was right or which side was wrong in Somali Civil War. It's not also about to tell if General Aidid was a popular leader or a wretched criminal and oppressor of his own people. It´s not about patriotism either which would be a very easy choice. And last but not least it's not about to tell if U.S. aim at intervening there was truly humanitarian or moved by economical or political or strategical purposes. This movie is about war. War that could happen in any part of the world. As one of main characters says in the end (I cannot recall the exact words): if you are asked why you are in this war you may answer that you are here because of the guy by your side. Which means that this movie is also and above all about friendship, comradeship and solidarity during fighting. In fact the most moving moments of the movie are those when those guys tried to help wounded or dying comrades under heavy fire with total abnegation and at risk of their own lives. Technically it's an almost perfect movie, one of the 5 or 6 best war movies ever made. All the scenes are extremely realistic and true in every detail and you feel yourself moving around those streets of a Somali city and almost taking part in the fighting yourself since you are so close to those men that you can almost touch them and feel their breaths. And we come come to the usual conclusion in the end: wars are cruel, useless and irrational.",7,0,0,10 February 2002
Silence," Great human document
","On 16th century Japanese missionaries had succeeded in introducing Catholicism in Japan and converted lots of people till this was considered a danger by Japanese authorities that outlawed Catholicism there and arrested and executed several missionaries. This movie is an excellent human document about this by telling us the story of two missionaries who travel to Japan to search their mentor of whom there were no reliable news. There they must face the severe persecution of the authorities though at first many converted peasants help and hide them. That puts them into a lot of trouble and the story is admirably told in several very dramatic scenes, excellent images and extremely good performance of the actors. There was a small flaw when a couple of Japanese authorities and leaders behaved more like western current people in terms of facial expressions and way of talking than the usual Japanese ones. But I think that in general this movie shows a vivid quality in terms of images, scenery and characters.",8,5,11,25 January 2017
Big Fish," Big lies great truth
",A poetical movie mixing reality and fancy so well and effectively that we cannot say where one ends and the other begins. Albert Finney makes a splendid role as a father telling his son stories of his life where he mixes real facts and events with fanciful narrations full of poetry and romanticism. The story begins when the already adult son is called from France to come near his dying father's bed and begins to revive all those stories that filled his childhood but had ended up by revolting him against what he later began to consider a pack of lies. But now he realizes that he doesn't know his father well and he approaches him willing to know really what and who he is indeed below the top of the iceberg to which he thinks he can compare his father's moral appearance and thus reach the true nature of his personality. It's a very beautiful story in itself and the fancy included in the father's tales are beautiful too both visually and in words. All the performers do an excellent work personifying charming characters. A landmark in the history of recent cinema indeed.,8,1,1,1 April 2012
The Dark Knight," The worst of them all
","This is indeed the worst of Batman's movies just because they have tried to make of it the best of them all and failed. This time besides the lots of action and explosions and computer made effects all of excellent quality, they have tried to inject also lots of philosophy and morals in the movie. The former turned out very cheap and the latter rather manichean in the sense of drawing a straight line between good and evil like if it was black and white and tried to pass a message on that. These action movies have everything to gain if they stay just in the aesthetic area where they belong: to amuse and entertain and don't try to bite off more than one can chew, mainly their usual fans. We don't expect of these movies a deep story but only the usual cheap one so it's better they don't try to sell us something more than good action and excellent images and visual sequences. Furthermore the story in this movie is full of unexplained flaws and loose ends. It has so many loose ends indeed that when they try to tie them up in the end to make a plausible finale (happy or unhappy end that wouldn't matter) they are unable to do it and the movie ends abruptly in the middle of the story in a poor way (like if they think of making a further episode but that's what you do when you don't know what to do to end it properly). Let's hope that the next episode of this saga is more modest in its pretensions and is then able to be classified as a good movie.",5,7,17,6 August 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Brilliant
","First of all and for the sake of the morals I hope that those who have a lip kiss are older than sixteen (both the characters and the performers -- actor and actress)-
Besides that this is a brilliant and wonderful movie not much for the story but for the amazing special effects, images and scenes that we are already present in alll movies of the Harry Potter saga. The permanent fight of Harry Potter, Ron and Hermione against the evil forces of Voldemort. This time with the help of Proffessor Dumbledore. The magic is also very important and is shown in most of the characers' action. Very pleasant to watch indeed.",7,0,3,25 June 2020
Into the Wild," Happiness only real when shared
","That's what the movie hero writes in his diary in the end. This movie tells the story of a young man who after graduating in university with very high marks decides to abandon home, family and everything and go to live into the wild in Alaska like if it was his promised land. He is pushed into that not only but what they call the lies of modern civilized life and social hypocrisy but also because, thinking like that, he is particularly hurt by his parents lies about their past private lives. While the movie progresses we hear his sister's voice off stressing the most important moments and aspects of his life. In my opinion the message the movie wants to pass is that there is a mistake to show revolt against society by running away to live with Nature and alone. In his course to Alaska our hero (who walks and hitch-hikes all the time) stops sometimes here and there to get occasional works that can give him a little money to enable him to support himself on his course. In those moments he creates bonds of friendship and love with lots of people but always rejects any possibilities of staying with them in his stubborn march to Alaska where he wants to spend at least a great part of his life in contact only with Mother Nature. He leaves lots of people who have become very fond of him, very unhappy with his absence. Mother nature is not always paradisiacal and may also be very cruel sometimes and even violent. And for instance the wild food it provides can be poisonous. Adding to the movie's credit are the beautiful landscape images and the splendid background music and songs of the country type.",7,1,2,27 February 2008
Blood Diamond," That's Africa
","Do you notice any blood on your diamond ring when you look at it Madam? No? Then go to see this movie and you'll notice it next time. The most remarkably good features of this movie are the reality of today's Africa and the amazing rhythm of the cut and the images with no dead moments. Particularly remarkable are the constant contrast of the appalling African sequences with the meetings and forums in the comfortable atmosphere of the First World where some dressy gentlemen discuss the problems of the diamond trade in a distant and unaffected way while a lot of bloodshed occurs because of it. This movie shows us a truth that can no longer be ignored after viewing it. In parallel with the struggle for the command of the diamond trade our attention is also drawn to the problem of the children soldiers in which the little children are changed into little killing monsters after being violently abducted from their families and subjected to a terrible brainwashing. The romantic and idealistic story which is the backbone of the movie, joining a white smuggler and a poor African fisherman has got a few flaws perhaps for excess of idealism but it arrives of moving us in the end. Maybe human nature is not so bad indeed after all. Those two characters are looking with different aims for a most invaluable diamond the fisherman has hidden underground. The smuggler wants the money it will give him while the fisherman wants only to be helped in finding his son that a rebel army has kidnapped to make him a child soldier. There is also the sentimental relationship between the smuggler and the woman journalist which occurs in an almost chaste and restrained atmosphere though we can feel its real deepness in some dialogues and even in some silences for instance when the woman caresses the smuggler's hand after he has told her how his parents were killed in Zimbabwe; we can feel his contained emotion after he finishes his story. This is one of the most moving scenes of the movie. But I need hardly say that in this movie nobody goes to bed with nobody. The fact is that we don't even see a single kiss which is rare in movies nowadays. And it looks like the most violent sequences which are numerous and admirably filmed are done without resorting to any special effects or computer tricks which makes them to appear extremely real.",7,0,0,21 March 2007
Men in Black," Good humour science-fi story
","And a technically very well made. The images, scenes and sequences are first class and spectacular in visual terms. The story is worth what it's worth in this kind of movies and we can't demand more but this one has a special feature beyond the train of monsters, violent scenes and wild fantasies: a good dose of humour in lots of scenes and the main two protagonists' speeches even in the most dangerous situations. The visual special effects are overwhelming and turn us breathless being also original and creative. The two main protagonists are very well in the role of intrepid and fearless special agents charged with the task of controlling the activity of aliens more or less clandestinely present in earth. It's a movie good to be seen with the usual limitations in terms of content but mastering a technique of great quality. A pleasant one and that's all.",6,0,0,19 July 2012
Pride & Prejudice," It's so good
","It's so good to wash our eyes and souls watching such a charming romantic movie after tons of bloodshed, violence, wars, horror, robots, special effects made by computer, etc. It's like to see something human after all. Well but I must comment on the merits of the movie itself and not dwell upon my filmic nostalgias. And besides it I don't want to give the impression that I don't appreciate many of those modern movies with bloodshed, robots, etc when they are good indeed. This movie tells us a story of the clash between the aristocratic way of life and values of England in the beginning of 19th century and that of the middle classes against the background of rural atmosphere. The members of the often impoverished middle classes aspire to imitate the aristocracy and if possible, to become its members one day too. For the girls however, the only hope is to marry noblemen preferably rich because at the time girls had no other choice for they were economically dependent since their birth because they were not allowed to get any profession or job that could bring them a substantial income. Therefore the parents of five girls like the one in the movie, whose income was rather low, had the hard task of marrying them all above their social status to avoid disgrace and ruin to the whole family. A hard task indeed. Well but human beings have feelings and sentiments and young men and girls tend to love one another irrespective of their social positions and that collides with such materialistic ideas. And the substance of romanticism is precisely this collision which was of course much more acute at the epoch portrayed in the movie than nowadays. This movie gives us that atmosphere through the good performance of its whole cast and the various scenes and dialogues where all these contradictions are shown and the sentiments are sometimes revealed sometimes concealed because of strict social and mundane or etiquette rules. In formal terms the images and sequences either interior or exterior are beautiful enough, express adequately the general atmosphere of the movie and are faithful to the portrayed epoch in every aspect.",7,0,2,8 March 2006
Puss in Boots," Puss in Boots rides again
","And does it more or less brilliantly now in the good company of Humpty Dumpty, Kitty Softpaws and Jack and Jill here transmuted into a couple of dangerous violent bandits. Dreamworks does a good job again in terms of animation, visual effects and characters design, expression and movements, making them looking human indeed. I have however a strong doubt about if this is an adequate movie for children given the violence of some scenes including a murder when Jack and Jill arrive at the hotel and shoot someone (whom we nevertheless don't see in fact just only hearing the shot and the body falling down) to get a vacant room. But a good animation movie to be seen by adults anyway. Ah and the story? Well the story is almost only a mere pretext to the images.",7,0,1,18 December 2011
Alice in Wonderland," Magnificent and splendorous
","I began by distrusting very much this 3D form as not adding any aesthetic value to any movie but after seeing this one I ended up by adhering fully to it. This is indeed maybe the best movie of this kind I have ever seen. The visual images and sceneries are splendorous, magnificent and fascinating, the special effects extremely well succeeded and really thrilling and the animated characters very well imagined and truly effective. The human roles are very well performed by all the actors and actresses involved and their make-up imaginative and convincing. The story of the return of Alice to the fantasy world of her childhood is really well conceived and told in original and beautiful terms. The cut rhythm is stunning and dazzling. In short, this is a movie which is imperative to see.",8,3,4,28 March 2010
The Artist," The apogee of silent cinema
","This movie tells us through the drama of the main character what was the the tragedy of many actors and actresses of the silent cinema who haven't adapted themselves to the talkies when they came because of their voices and not only that (Greta Garbo of all). Some performers and directors rejected also the talkies for aesthetic reasons considering it was not good cinema. Silent cinema marked an epoch and even shaped a life conception. In my opinion it wasn't only a starting stage of the cinema as an art but also a different kind of cinema and which could therefore have coexisted with the talkies. The visual technique employed in it, the expressionist performance of actors and actresses, the romantic nature of most stories, all of that was its peculiar mark. Director Hazanavicius has opted here to tell the story in terms of a silent movie using for that all the usual visual and performing techniques proper to that kind of cinema which makes the viewer to integrate himself better in the story atmosphere and even to understand better the drama of the silent movie's actor who not only doesn't feel ready to act on the talkies but also that rejects their aesthetic value which makes him to sink in moral and material misery. His drama is stressed by the fact that the girl he loves from the beginning and that was brought by him to the cinema suddenly became a talkies' star. A good movie to which we cannot demand more since the story is somewhat limited.",7,1,3,31 August 2012
La La Land," Good music, nice story
","From time to time we feel the need of watching a movie without too many special effects, explosions, people punching, kicking, shooting and killing people. This is the one. And it has no sex on the bed either. Jazz, pop music (but mainly jazz) and even old style tap dancing. Everything mixed up with a tender love story half real half dreamed between a jazz pianist and a girl who is trying to start a life as an actress. A technically excellent movie in terms of cut and image sequences, some of them very beautiful. For instance the opening sequence of a collective dance on a road filled with cars during a traffic jam is wonderful indeed. A movie to be loved, almost a masterpiece.",7,0,5,3 February 2017
Super 8," two stories one movie
","This movie tells us two stories indeed in two different plots intertwined: one is about a group of high school kids trying to make a zombies movie and the other one about a war between air force and an alien whose ship has fallen on Earth some years before and is desperately trying to repair it in order to be able to return to his planet or galaxy while the air force men try to prevent that and eventually kill or capture him. This fight is shown through enormous and appalling explosions and scenes of huge destruction taking place in a small Ohio town. This second plot is poor and not very inventive in itself and what saves the movie of a total collapse is the first plot, the kids one, which is vivid and shows a team of kids united by friendship, cooperation and solidarity bonds almost limitless not only about their zombies movie project but also amidst the catastrophic scenes above referred. Just a passable movie, to put it in a nutshell.",5,0,0,9 August 2011
The Last Samurai," The Path of Honour
","If you take for granted that a Japanese samurai in 1876 can speak impeccable English you will most certainly love this movie because all the rest is practically flawless and it's a really unmatched work of art, romantic and epic. We watch here the conflict between two civilizations, cultures and ways of life: a dying one based in honour, heroism, valour and loyalty and the other based in greed for power, disloyalty and meanness. The outcome of this unfair fight takes place in the battlefield through scenes hardly reached till now in any movie I have seen before. The brilliant direction of this movie is not affected by the apparent easiness and lightness of the final scenes which leaves us with a few doubts from the angle of the logic and likelihood of that part of the plot. But like an Italian would say: 'se non e vero e bene trovato' (if it's not true it's well invented). The main character whose role is performed by Tom Cruise is very well depicted, showing us the spiritual evolution of the soldier who goes to Japan with the charge of teaching and training the new army, haunted by the memories of massacres of innocent women and children that he watched in his own country perpetrated by the army he had served till then. In contact with the rapidly changing Japanese reality his mind suffers a complete catharsis which leads him first to abandon alcohol into which he had taken refuge, and then progressively to assimilate the moribund cultural values of the people whom in principle he should help to fight. On the whole a beautiful movie to be seen in terms of images and which will make you think a lot of things over.",7,0,0,22 January 2004
Sicario," Drug traffic and corruption
","This movie is different from those we use to see of this kind. It has other elements such as personal motivations and relationships, police corruption and the opposition between legal and illegal ways of fighting drug traffic. A CIA agent included in a SWAT team that is trying to find and arrest a drug traffic Mexican boss uses violent and illegal methods of dealing with traffickers while capturing and interrogating them to which an idealistic DEA lady agent who accompanies the team is opposed and refuses to collaborate. This leads to a conflict that is shown in some expressive and intense dramatic scenes. Besides this the usual violent scenes of chasing and shooting are appalling and very well filmed. If only by its unusual theme development this movie is worth to be seen.",7,0,3,3 November 2015
Inside Man," Weak story
","If this movie had been as meticulously planned as the bank robbery it describes, perhaps it could be a good movie. However the intricate plot it tries to tell us, has some obscure or less well explained aspects beginning by the motives and personality of the robbers. The first part of the movie is convincing in terms of action and situations and the dialogues are lively and witty. But from the moment where the character of the president (and owner) of the stormed bank begins to define itself in terms of his past guilty actions, the story becomes banal and ends in a very uninteresting and meaningless way. The performance of such good players like Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster is about good and that's all.",6,1,2,19 April 2006
Les Misérables," Grandiose
","The famous novel by Victor Hugo, 'Les Miserables' has already had several adaptations for cinema but none so grandiose as this one in my opinion. Not exactly because of the music since I think that its music or the lyrics are not very rich or brilliant and singers not particularly good at it. But the development and presentation of the story are great indeed as well as the performing of the cast and the depth and strength of the dramatic scenes from beginning till the end. As most of us know by having read the novel in our youth, this is the moving story of an ex-convict released on parole and being hunted by inspector Javert during all the rest of his life for having broken parole rules by evading vigilance and building himself a new honest life who brought him to the post of mayor in a town. Javert was the symbol of those law agents who care more of the strict law abiding than of human justice. The other main characters are the young girl Cosette that our ex-con takes care of during his permanent trial to escape Javert's searching for his whereabouts to have him jailed again and her young revolutionary lover. The action in the movie gains more and more dramatic intensity till its epic end when the plot mixes itself with the events of the aborted revolution of 1832 in Paris. The street fighting and the barricades scenes are violent in terms of action and very well filmed.To love this,movie you must forget its musical weaknesses in my opinion and stick to the story drama.",8,0,1,6 January 2013
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Nice but unbalanced
","The first part of the movie is very good with an excellent re-creation of the atmosphere imagined by J. K Rowling in the book on which it was inspired. All visual special effects are very imaginative and of very good quality. The characters are well designed and very convincing. The human nature (bad or good) of these wizards is extremely well shaped and their performances extremely charming. Well this is true for the first part of the movie which shows, so to speak, the presentation of Hogwarth, the wizard school and its masters and students with a special prominence of the main character of Harry Potter (a well chosen charming child actor) and his two companions Hermione and Ron. However the second part in which the main plot of the searching for the sorcerer's stone develops itself, is much less brilliant in terms of imagination and special effects, becoming sometimes a bit dull and commonplace.",6,0,0,24 December 2008
The Untouchables," Good though not particularly brilliant
","Once more the story of the Untouchables led by the federal agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) that defeated the gang lord Al Capone (Robert De Niro) at Chicago in 1930. Capone ruled most of the city through violations of the Prohibition law, smuggling, bootlegging and the bribery of policemen and authorities. These are the two characters who stand out in this movie leading the plot to a struggle which becomes personal between them. Besides these two another character stands out too: the honest policeman (Sean Connery) that joined the Untouchables and ends up murdered by the gang. Without being especially brilliant this is undoubtedly a good movie for it tells with enough visual realism the story of the gangster whom it was never possible to convict for his countless crimes and ended up convicted for tax evasion (a serious crime in USA) in eleven years in jail. Good history sequence, realistic violence scenes and good job of the acting performers. And nothing else except perhaps an anthology scene almost in the end: a baby pram rolling down a staircase at the railway station in the middle of a fusillade reminding us of the famous scene of the movie The Battleship Potemkin at the Odessa steps.",7,0,0,10 August 2014
The Matrix Reloaded," More of the same
","This endless story of The Matrix has got here one further episode. The only merit of this movie consists of a series of well made sequences (computer made) which are breathtaking indeed and very successful. But I don't include in these the long, dull, boring and repetitive ballets of martial arts fights already much seen and reseen in this kind of movies without bringing anything new or original. This story of two parallel worlds (with ubiquitous characters present sometimes in them both at same time) is told in a confusing and incoherent way (even taking for granted the fanciful movie script itself) which is aggravated by some speeches of cheap philosophy like those uttered by such characters as Merovingian or The Architect the latter near the end of the movie. When we get to the end we realize that the story is not finished yet and another movie is announced with more of the same. Well, if it were not for the good technical direction we would have here a negligible movie that intrinsically is neither better nor worse than the average movies of this kind.",6,0,1,1 October 2008
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," A prodigious original creative imagination
","The books by J. K. Rowling narrating Harry Potter's saga are indeed the product of a powerful creative imagination and an original one into the bargain. She creates an universe that lives entirely in her head around a school of wizards that is described in all its details, rules, habits and characters whatever odd or strange they may be making it to appear as real. The atmosphere of the school situates itself in an old mansion or castle or palace which lends it a Gothic atmosphere that adds mystery to the stories involved. This movie follows faithfully these features without losing its aesthetic autonomy as a movie (which is an art other than literature) translating the most thrilling moments of the book by effective visual effects. The fantastic scenes which we see, however, are not more thrilling than others shown on other fantastic movies. And of course we cannot forget this is a movie for children or teen-agers therefore we adults must forget our own values while watching it. Nevertheless, as usual, the general subject is the fight between Good and Evil which always ends with the latter's defeat though only temporary because in the following movie of the series that fight is resumed again. A good movie to entertain and amuse and nothing more.",6,0,0,20 February 2008
The Departed," Almost good
","This could be a good film if it weren't for a few loose ends in the development of the story and a couple of strange coincidences made up to maintain the plot in line with the general structure of the script. This said what is left to remark: first of all the superb performance of Jack Nicholson, perhaps one of the best of his career, as Costello the Mafia gang chief. Then the good technical quality of the movie and the excellent acting of the other performers. One word too for the good form of all the violent scenes which are truly made and convincing. In conclusion, a movie that can have you agreeably occupied for about 3 hours without adding any special event to the history of cinema.",6,2,3,28 June 2009
Psycho," Too unconvincing to be true
","I never was a great Hitchcock fan and this movie did nothing to change my mind. It's indisputable that he makes very good movies from the formal-technical point of view and that he knows how to create a suspense and (or) horror atmosphere with great mastery and skillfulness but the stories he tells us are too fanciful to be real (despite the fact that they are presented as real)and when he dives into the psychological pathology of his characters he becomes much unconvincing. For instance in this movie the psychiatrist's explanation which takes place in the final scene doesn't seem to me to have great scientific rigor, looking more like pure fantasy. Nevertheless it's true indeed that this movie (like others he has made) keeps us stuck to our seats and wrapped up in the story unfolding from the first to the last scene. Only later and after the movie ends do we emerge from that spell to realize that all that has very little juice in terms of psychological reality. This movie has however also a remarkable feature in the performance of the great actor who is Anthony Perkins who makes and excellent character very well adapted to the role that the movie's director gave him and with great and talented sobriety.",6,3,10,3 August 2006
War of the Worlds," A bit outdated
","Any analysis to this movie must have two realities into account: the images and the story. The former are as strong as we all have already become accustomed to in watching Spielberg's movies. The latter is rather weak and a bit outdated. When H. G. Wells wrote this story in 1898 modern science, mechanics, astronomy, aviation, etc were still in their primordia. Even Jules Verne had not ventured to enter deeply into those fields. Therefore this story which was maybe the first one that made a solid approach to a broader conception of the universe and the possibility of other forms of life besides the human one, has had a great impact upon readers. It was then a great exercise of imagination and creativity. But since then not only enormous progress has been made in those above mentioned fields but also literature saw the birth of a new branch the so called science fiction which has until now already explored all the possible fields related to space travel (which is furthermore a reality nowadays). Hundreds of novels, stories and movies have already been produced on those themes using much more modern conceptions. Therefore it looks like a bit outmoded to conceive an invasion of our planet by those monstrous three-legged machines like Wells (who knew nothing of cybernetics and computers) had conceived them according to the mechanical knowledge of his time. It should have been more appropriate to refresh the story with more sophisticated scientific and mechanical ideas to adapt it to our current knowledge. The invading machines (I say 'invading' despite the fact that they were hidden underground in this planet) are very unconvincing in terms of that knowledge. The sentimental story that is supposed to be the human ingredient of the movie is too conventional and too much already seen, of the divorced couple whose children suffer the respective trauma. Too much déjà vu and sameness on those scenes too. Well but if all you want is to watch a lot of sequences which will keep you stuck in dread to your seat go and watch it.",6,0,1,20 July 2005
12 Years a Slave," Explosive images and superb acting
",Black is beautiful. This is in my opinion the best movie about slavery ever made. Because it portrays the drama of slavery not only in the usual general terms but also the personal and individual drama of the main protagonists with great depth. A free black man who lives in the north with his wife and children is abducted and taken to Georgia where he is turned into a slave to work as a farm labourer in extremely hard conditions. Through the story dramatically very well told in images and scenes we are also aware of the process of slavery with all its course of violence and the severe violation of the most basic human rights of men and women. The images and scenes are powerful and extremely impressive. The acting by all performers is superb and there is a remarkable set of black performers who do an excellent job. This is in fact an unmissable movie.,8,1,3,4 January 2014
Wedding Crashers," A good laugh indeed
","I was always amazed by the wedding crash sport. I never could understand why wedding crashers are so seldom caught. I think that's maybe because they always chose crowded wedding parties where the bride's guests and family think they are groom's guests or relatives and vice versa. This bright comedy movie proves it again. Two philanderers, despite the fact they are not exactly badly off in life, amuse themselves crashing wedding parties galore to eat and drink freely and above all pick up ladies and girls to take to bed at first opportunity. However one day things turn out badly since not only they are caught red-handed but one of them falls in love with the bride's sister who is engaged to another guy also present in the party and after they manage to be invited for a stay in the father of the bride's house at the seaside under false identities. This is a simple story but it develops itself in a series of funny moments with some hilarious gags which will make you laugh a lot. I only didn't like very much the choice of Vince Vaughn for the role of Jeremy Grey one of the womanizer guys. He is a bit too common for a seducer at high society level but anyway he tries do his his best at it. But the most important thing is that this movie is apt to raise a good laugh indeed.",7,1,1,5 October 2005
Joker," A not so funny clown
","This is the story of a man with psychic troubles who is a clown hired mainly for publicity jobs. Life begins to become hard for him chiefly when he is fired. He enters then on a confused behaviour which includes a crime spiral. His activity becomes intertwined with the people's social and economic public protests in town. This makes the movie also a one of social protest, and demonstration sometimes publicly violent. The plot relationship between these two aspects of the story is well done and shown in the movie which well acted and directed.",7,1,6,23 October 2019
Man on Fire," The bodyguard's bloody revenge
",This highly improbable story (is it veridical I mean inspired in some real events?) is well told indeed in a bright succession of short plans and brief sequences that rivet your attention all the time with no gaps in the action from beginning to the end. Denzel Washington is superb as the cold blooded bodyguard that starts a series of well planned and executed killings to revenge the murder of the child that he protected. There is not much more to say about this movie because the simplicity of the script doesn't allow great raptures of creativity or imagination. Therefore this movie can be classified more as an honest work of an artisan than a masterpiece of an artist.,6,0,0,28 September 2004
Downfall," The end of a human monster
","This is undoubtedly one of the best movies I've ever seen. Its direction is almost perfect in all its aspects: sceneries, camera movements, screen-play, acting, technical features, etc.. The character of Hitler is so well performed by Bruno Ganz that we forget that we are before an actor and come to think we are before Hitler himself. The movie shows with striking realism all the contrast between the almost normal and quiet bunker scenes and the awful war ones taking place outside with all their fights and the drama lived by the civil population. Inside the bunker we watch the progressive psychological and physical decay of the dictator still surrounded for his few fanatic supporters still ready to die for him and his ideology when outside in the city all crumbles under Soviet fire. The mad man still believes the war can be won and in the map he moves military units and divisions that don't exist anymore. Since monsters can sometimes also be human beings we can watch sometimes a few human and even generous attitudes of Hitler and his followers. Some people have criticized this as attempts to show Hitler and the Nazis under a more favourable light. I don't agree with this. Realism is realism and must not be Manichean. If we want to know a human being (though a monster) in all his entirety we must know all of his or her features. The movie is realistic in all its aspects and with extreme rigour. All the characters act just like we expect them to do and incarnate extremely well the real people they are supposed to do. Particularly moving are the scenes where Frau Goebbels proceeds to poison their children before committing suicide with her husband, acting simultaneously like a tender and nice mother and an horrible monster. This movie is a real landmark in the history of cinema.",9,2,4,14 November 2007
The Wolf of Wall Street," Money, sex, drugs and corruption
","This is the supposedly veracious story of Jordan Belfort a Long Island stockbroker who almost from nothing built a firm that kept growing through illegal schemes, defrauding clients and the State and became very wealthy leading a luxurious life in luxurious surroundings till he attracted the attention of the FBI which began to harass him till it managed to have him convicted to prison on a relatively light penalty after he made an agreement with the prosecution by which he agreed to cooperate with authorities in denouncing some of his collaborators and employees. Leonardo Di Caprio does an excellent job personifying this character. The movie scenes are very expressive and vivid in images and dialogues showing us a lot of dishonest people whose only worries are about getting the most possible money which is one of the aspects of capitalism. The screen-play is very authentic and convincing in this aspect. Money, sex, drugs and corruption galore in the behaviour of the chief characters. Summing it up, a good story, well narrated, depicted and acted.",8,0,2,20 January 2014
"Hail, Caesar!"," Not so funny
",A Hollywood fixer exerts a tough authority upon all those who work in the studios slapping their faces inclusive. He has also problems with two lady journalists. This is supposed to be a comedy but it is not so funny indeed. It deals with earnest things such as religion and communism. Two excellent actors like George Clooney and Ralph Fiennes are ill-spent in this movie. I went to see it because I have read some favourable reviews on a newspaper including from critics I respect but frankly I don't know what they have seen in this movie that I cannot see. Some scenes are even ludicrous. The main story is about making a film about the life of Christ. We see also there shootings of other movies such as a musical and a western. The characters are faint and unconvincing.,4,1,3,13 April 2016
Dark Shadows," Vampires and witches can also have sentiments
","This is a good fantastic movie directed by the firm hand of Tim Burton who is a specialist in this kind of movies. It benefits also of a luxury cast with great performers such as Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer and Helena Bonham Carter. It's a story of a love-hate relationship between a witch (the beautiful Eva Green) and a man she transforms into a vampire (Johnny Depp) and has him buried for two centuries to punish him for rejecting her love after having induced by witchcraft the woman he loved to kill herself. When he is disinterred by chance he regains his place in his family's estate and the war begins again between them also because meanwhile his family had lost their local power to the witch although they ignore she is one. This struggle assumes physical aspects sometimes extremely violent and very well filmed and acted. But the final scenes are particularly moving. This good movie could be very good indeed were not for some loose ends in certain scenes not well explained by images or words. And of course in this kind of vampire movies we always must accept and take for granted the several gratuitous murders the vampire performs to feed on his victims' blood. And it proves also how vampires and witches can also have sentiments. One of the best movies of this kind after all and this kind doesn't allow much better by its own nature.",7,1,2,19 June 2012
Inception," Dreams dreams dreams
","This movie has got powerful images and sequences some violent and aggressive some beautiful even poetical. We are from the beginning caught and dazzled by this net of dreams and counterdreams and subconscious analysis in an overwhelming whirl of scenes vibrating with action of body and mind. It's indeed a rich film in visual terms with lots of original and good ideas. In what concerns the story despite the moving love subplot it also tells us, after watching half of the movie we begin to think there is little logic in all those entangled dreams and subdreams and begin even to become somewhat bored.Fortunately after so much confusion the final scenes throw light upon the whole story erasing the frontier between dream and reality and giving the story its truthful meaning in an unexpected turn. Go and watch it very carefully and you will be very surprised in the end.",7,2,5,10 August 2010
Lord of War," This theme should deserve better
",If it weren't for the scenes taking place in Liberia which show some kind of truth and realism and for the final scenes my vote for this movie would be much lower. In fact this movie is rather weak as a libel against arms traffic since the scenario is full of cheap ideas with some improbable or unexplained developments (for instance how and where could a modest Ukrainian immigrant suddenly find the necessary capital to create so quickly a large arms dealing business?).The dialogues and the off comments by the main character intend to be cynical but exhibit a large amount of commonplace philosophy about arms dealing after all. Even the sentimental story of the arms dealer and his wife is rather watery since the beginning and the sudden consciousness of the latter about the true business of her husband is quite unconvincing. The players do their work so so except of course Nicolas Cage who does a great job in a movie whose quality is unequal to his talent. The theme of arms trafficking deserved a better movie indeed.,6,1,5,2 November 2005
Sherlock Holmes," Disappointing
","Those who will start to watch this movie convinced that they will lhave the usual story of Conan Doyle's novels or the movies inspired in them, will be deceived because what this movie has in common with that is only the character's names: Holmes, Watson. Lestrade (and a reference to Dr. Moriarty). All the rest has nothing to do with the maint heme of Conan Doyle's stories namely the Homes' mental deductive capacity that leads him to solve crimes authorship and discover their authors. What we see here is Holmes and Watson as two young men (and not the usual middle aged ones sitting quietly at home) involved in physical fighting outside besides fires and explosions galore. Black magis is also present and figure yourself that Dr. Watson has even a girlfriend. We don't understand why makig a movie supposedly concerning Sherlock Homes, Dr. Watson and others without conveying the true literary fictitious well known characters. This movie story could be made with any other characters even because it has good images, sceneries and garment figures portraying 19th century atmosphere.",5,0,1,26 May 2020
WALL·E," Cybernetic prodigy
","Yes cybernetic, electronic, mechanical prodigy. Images mathematically reproduced of movements of robots, computers and various almost supernatural machines that will leave you bewildered, amazed and astonished. Behind that there is a bit of history of the planet Earth that has been abandoned by the Human Race and is now only a pile of garbage, litter and polluted waste where a small nice robot itself made of scrap iron, tries to put some order into it and cleaning a bit. What remains of mankind now lives in a huge spatial vessel having become a very fat species lying down on some kind of chair beds, attended upon by a legion of robots of any kind. However a probe feminine robot is sent to earth to estimate conditions there and a romance starts between her and the poor little robot called Wall-E which leads to a series of proper that turns down in the end on a much more human finale. The philosophy of this movie after all goes against the usual trend of these computer animated movies which privilege mechanical values instead of human ones. Here the human and nature values finish by bearing the palm over the artificial cold mechanical ones. If you have the habit of leaving your chair as soon as the movie ends I strongly advise you not to do so with this movie and stay seated till the technical data scroll down completely because they are accompanied by very nice images and a beautiful music.",7,0,2,2 September 2008
The Terminal," Unplausible but good
","Out of this unplausible story of a man forced to live in an airport for several weeks (or months?) because of a law gap, Spielberg makes a nice and humane movie with a few successful situation gags, a solidarity chain among simple people, a sentimental tale hidden in a peanut can and a few drops and romance between our man and an air hostess hit by existential troubles. Well you must also take for granted a few other unlikely things such as that despite the fact that when the main character came into the airport after landing, he practically didn't know a word of English, after a few days he talked passably well and that he managed to change the space of an airport door into a bedroom for him without nobody seeming to notice it for months. Anyway the most important feature of this movie is that simplicity, honesty and solidarity triumph over bureaucracy, inhumanity and injustice in the end.",7,0,0,2 October 2004
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A too ambitious movie
","That it does not come up that ambition. First of all the main character is rather uncongenial, a truculent and arrogant man who hostilizes almost everybody often without reason. The story is an acceptable one but not particularly moving or dramatic: an actor who was famous for his role of a comic book character and that now ends his career by trying to put a play on a Broadway theatre stage. In doing this he meets a few obstacles such as a bad relationship with another actor and some unfavourable newspaper critiques. And personally he has got a conflict with his daughter. All this is rather ordinary in human terms. Besides that he seems to confuse himself with Birdman his former character that has made him famous, hearing and listening to his voice. This is a bit inadequate. The movie is nevertheless rather good in technical cinematographic terms.",6,8,16,3 March 2016
Prometheus," Technically very good but the rest...
","Why Ridley Scott didn't use his great talent to make just a sci-fi movie instead of complicating the plot by putting its characters on a search of the origins of mankind which is a goal that would demand a philosophic and metaphysical depth that goes far beyond the scope of this kind of movie? The result is that the movie story has some gaps and illogical unexplained features that diminish its impact and chooses a simple answer to a difficult question. Besides the usual implausible scenes that we always take for granted in a sci-fi movie because of its fanciful nature this movie exaggerates on that field with some incredible scenes like the one of the mechanical surgery for instance. However this movie is one of the best ever made in technical terms. The images, sceneries and landscapes are really overwhelming and appalling and the sound track is fabulous stressing the visual effects in a prodigious way with a music that enhances the general atmosphere of the movie in a remarkable way. And the action is also overpowering indeed. So if you privilege those visual features in this kind of movies this is a good film for you.",6,6,9,19 June 2012
Halloween," Goodish
","For me a good comedy is one which makes me laugh, a good drama one which makes me weep or at least feel a lump in my throat, a message movie one which makes me feel the message and agree with it and a horror movie one which scares me indeed. Well this movie scared me enough though not too much. Its slow rhythm keeps us waiting for the climax all the time playing on our nerves and when it comes it doesn't disappoint us. That means that the movie is well balanced in terms of images and suggestions. Are we before a man which is insane beyond any limits and has got almost superhuman powers or are we before a creature which is human only in appearance and is indeed an evil supernatural being in human shape? The movie never explains it fully which adds to its terrifying power. A few flaws here and there are mere details and don't spoil much the logic of the plot. We can ask for instance why the plate number of the car stolen by the murderer isn't communicated to all authorities in which case he would have been quickly caught. But maybe it was and doesn't need to be mentioned in the movie because everything happened so quickly and the murderer went to a small town where that information would perhaps not get quickly enough. Well anyway if the murderer was caught too soon the story could not be told and the movie could not be made. Summing it up we can call this movie goodish after all.",7,0,0,27 January 2005
Shrek," Ugly is beautiful
","This story is another one which explodes the myth that ugly always goes with evil. Shrek is the ugly ogre who tries to disguise his golden heart behind rude manners and mood. Like any other being rejected by society he reacts accordingly. But his rudeness is finally melted first by a talkative small donkey who imposes himself as his friend and then by the love of the ugly beautiful princess. Even the dragon, another evil monster, is converted to goodness by love. This half funny half tender episode of the love between the she-dragon and the small donkey is another ingredient that makes this tale a wonderful story where all the traditional characters of almost all the children's fairy tales are also present though only for a short while turning it into some kind of revival of all those tales. The computer animation technique is almost perfect and serves here a good cause.",7,0,0,5 September 2001
The Dark Knight Rises," Much confusion
","And a lot of turns in the plot, gaps, unexplained events and situations and loose ends. Also too many characters sometimes doing we don't know what or what for. To compensate this there is a lot of good action, suspense, violence and special effects of good quality. And there are a few other ingredients not very usual in this kind of movie like philosophy, sentiment, emotion and even a bit of love and sex. This is the story of a city threatened with a nuclear holocaust by a gang of mercenaries led by a madman that sometimes tries to appear as a social fighter in a populist vein. After being retired for some years Batman rides again to fight this threat and his author. Curious also is that this time Batman isn't always the kind of superman we are used to but shows some weaknesses in a more realistic way. Summing it up it's a movie that will entertain you well for 160 minutes. Don't demand more than this.",6,1,5,10 January 2013
The Croods," Too violent and somewhat unclear
","This animation movie tells a story of a family of troglodytes whose cave was destroyed by an earthquake and embarked on the search of a new one led by the family leader and father while the purpose of two young members of the team was to reject the leaders aim and search a life under the sun in open air. The story in itself is not interesting enough and it develops itself through too many violent clashes, tumbles, falls, somersaults and earthquakes most of them unnecessary and even not very funny. Like someone once said about a play written by a novice: it has many good scenes and many original ones but the good ones are not original and the original ones are not good. The most positive feature of this movie is the very imaginative creation of strange, beautiful and fanciful animals that people the scenery. Anyway I have seen much better movies of this kind.",6,0,5,17 April 2013
Casino Royale," The hawthorn can't give apples
","James Bond's movie stories and the likes of them are worth what they are and we cannot ask for very deep plots, messages or pathetic dramas. They are made only to amuse us for a couple of hours and make us forget the sorrows of life. But even in that framing we may ask that they amuse us with some logic and likelihood because they are not exactly farces (where nonsense is admitted as an art). We don't want them to be just a pile of more or less breathtaking scenes without any convincing thread putting them together. This new James Bond movie suffers precisely of these defects. A British spy trying to deprive 'terrorists' of their financial means without us knowing which kind of 'terrorists' are those since the world now is full of terrorists of several colours and allegiances some of them even opposed. At least during Cold War the camps were clearly defined. We are thus presented with a succession of scenes (most of them much more violent than in precedent Bond's movies and with much more blood spilling) of great visual impact without a convincing story behind them. As a matter of fact we don't even end by knowing who is with whom and against whom since Bond's adversaries are presented as belonging to different camps so often till the end of the movie. The sentimental story introduced in the second half is so stereotyped that it's quite unconvincing as well as its outcome in the end. Daniel Craig makes a James Bond much tougher than all his predecessors namely Roger Moore and Sean Connery who had much more elegance and subtlety. Craig is a bit loutish as a matter of fact. What remains then of this movie? Nothing more than the real thrilling impact of some visual scenes despite the unlikelihood of some of them. The hawthorn cannot give apples indeed.",5,3,4,6 December 2006
Toy Story 3," Again
","This movie is not better or worse than the other first two ones of the same puppet saga which means again that it's also good, a quality enhanced this time by the 3D version. The same technical perfection in animation, the originality, creativeness and inventiveness in the conception of characters and scenes, the great facial and body expressiveness of the former which confers them human features and a sentimental story of fraternity, friendship and tenderness (notwithstanding a few mean creatures precisely to strike the contrast). The visual effects are very impressive. A good movie to be seen both by children and grown-ups. Unfortunately I cannot give opinion about the voices of the actors and actresses that dubbed the puppets because I saw a Portuguese version talked in Portuguese.",7,0,1,11 August 2010
Signs," The Message
",Yes this movie has got a more or less clear message in religious terms therefore it will be viewed from different angles depending on if you are a believer or an unbeliever. The former will find it a great movie while the latter will think it's a complete nonsense. For agnostics like myself the message will be disregarded and we'll prefer to concentrate our attention on the filmic discourse. Well it's a sci-fi thriller as you probably already know and a just passable one I mean it has no special flaws to be denounced but no special inventive or original features either. The story unfolds itself in somewhat predictable developments and the acting is neither bad nor particularly good maybe with the exception of the 2 kids who deserve a special mark though the boy seems to be a little too gifted for his age but we are used to that already in children roles. Well summing it up if the night is too cold and if you are an unbeliever or an agnostic stay comfortably at home and don't lose your time going out to see this movie.,6,0,2,24 November 2002
Identity," Very stupid movie
","And too ambitious and ridiculously pretentious. A stormy night assembles a lot of characters in a motel: a couple and their kid, a driver who has knocked down this couple's wife, a girl who is traveling to work in an orange garden, a policeman who is taking a handcuffed convicted killer who was about to be executed but whose lawyer has managed to get a judge's reevaluation of the case on the ground of his mental insanity and a young couple recently married. Add to them the motel manager, a young man not very convincing. This leads to a lot of murders that keep occurring successively. There is a permanent heavy rain outside and since the characters keep walking in and out they are wet to the skin. To this succession of not so explicable events a fanciful imaginary nonsense psychiatric explanation is invented and forced in the end through a succession of unconvincing images. To watch this movie is a sheer waste of time.",5,1,3,28 May 2016
Saving Mr. Banks," Nice amusing film
",This story of the discords between Pamela L. Travers the author of novel 'Mary Poppins' and Walt Disney about the adaptation of it to the cinema is shown in a vivid succession of sequences going to and fro between Austrália in 1906 and London / Los Angeles in 1961 in constant flashbacks to show us how Mrs. Travers (like she always demands to be called against any familiarities) had a traumatic childhood mainly because of her father alcoholic behaviour despite the fact that they loved each other deeply. This explains her disagreeable and sometimes rude behaviour and way of treating other people. We don't know if this movie respects the truthfulness of what happened in fact concerning her relationship with Walt Disney and his collaborators while preparing the movie and that was full of disagreements. Anyway a work of art even when biographic doesn't need to respect truth in every detail and can use fancy to enhance it aesthetically providing it does not wrest the central meaning of the reality that happened in fact. Although some scenes are a bit caricatural the movie in its whole is totally acceptable and Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks do a wonderful job as the two main characters.,7,1,2,10 February 2014
Beowulf," How the horrendous can also be beautiful
","The epic poem called Beowulf was probably written in the 8th century in Anglo-Saxon dialect and it tells the story and prodigious adventures of the hero of that name, King of the Geats of Jutland. These adventures are narrated now in this good movie in an admirable way full of powerful and beautiful images (even if sometimes horrendous) and movement. The story is told more by images than words and some of them are really breath-taking. The legendary atmosphere of tales of High Middle Ages is very well presented. This story of heroes, monsters, warriors, witches and ordinary men is very well told indeed in all its aspects. One of the best movies of this kind.",7,1,3,5 December 2007
Son of Saul," Horrifying all the same
","Maybe I am wrong but I think I have read somewhere that Holocaust survivors who still exist, say that of all the films made about the Holocaust till now this is the one that better and more authentically reproduces the real atmosphere of a nazi extermination camp. In fact to begin with, the shooting technique puts us the viewers inside the camp among its inmates because it uses almost all the time the close up image mainly focused on the protagonist's face while he walks and wanders among the prisoners and meanwhile we hear the noises off made by the terrified people penned up in the gas chamber, their desperate cries and loud weeping, the bangs and clangs on the chamber doors and the yelling orders of the German officers who utter the cry of 'schneller' (faster) all the time. The protagonist is a Sonderkommando (an inmate who is treated less ruthlessly because he is employed by the Germans in collaborating with then in the task of herding the other prisoners although a few months later Sonderkommandos could be killed themselves). His main purpose is trying to give a proper Jewish religious funeral to a young boy that survived to the gas inhalation to be afterwards smothered to death by a German officer. For that he hides the corpse and tries to find a rabbi to perform the funeral in a secret way of course. All the time we can feel the brutal and intensely dramatic atmosphere of the camp. Despite not showing much the usual particularly awful images of other Holocaust movies, it is horrifying all the same.",Null,0,1,20 April 2016
Live Free or Die Hard," The usual thing
","The usual violent thrilling movie with lots of shootings, kilings and acrobatic car and truck chases but well filmed and enthralling, A man who served in the US department of Defense was disgraced after trying to prove unsuccessfully to his bosses that the government networks were susceptible of being hacked and suspended. He started then to act using his technical knowledge and ability to suspend and put down all the US government networks. He was pursued by a detective that from a certain moment on made it as a personal case because the hacker had managed to kidnap his daughter. And this makes it a thrilling movie full of action and suspense that rivet's your attention from the beginning till the end. This the best feature of the movie since the plot is not too strong.",6,0,1,12 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Brilliant images and sequences
","We meet here again our well known characters of the previous episodes some of them of course older namely Han Solo and Princess Leia and we meet also the humanoids and androids some of them also already known. This movie figures once again the fight between Good and Evil, the Force of Light and the Dark Force in a succession of brilliant images and sequences and prodigious and stunning special effects mainly with the frightful flights and chasings of the spaceships. And in between, now and then a sentimental note of friendship and comradeship is introduced which softens a bit the atmosphere of the almost permanent violence. The visual atmosphere including the figures of the humanoids, androids and material gadgets is very imaginative. A movie that keeps you thrilled all the time you stay watching it.",7,3,35,5 January 2016
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Too much destruction
","Of course one day the Harry Potter movie saga would come to an end also because the main performers are becoming older and sooner or later would not be able to act the characters of the children student wizards. With the books by J. K. Rowling it's different since they have no images. I must begin to say that I have not seen Part One therefore what I am saying here must be read having that in mind. This movie favours violent action and a lot of destruction to the detriment of the poetry of magics we have seen for instance in the H. P. AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN movie. However we must recognize that the special visual effects are unbeatable, thrilling and of excellent quality. The story is not very rich and original in terms of suspense but we can be properly entertained while watching all the adventurous scenes. One last word to the final scenes that re-establish the above mentioned poetry.",6,1,1,29 July 2011
Munich," He who takes the sword...
","...shall perish with the sword. That's what my grandmother already used to say. The problem are the so-called collateral damages (killing innocent people, etc). It looks like this movie has roused great hostility in Israel you can never tell why since it's not for or against Israel nor for or against Palestinians. It doesn't take sides in that conflict. It only shows a bunch of murderers on both sides but we all know already that terrorists and secret agents are flour of the same bag either they belong to CIA, KGB, Mossad, ETA, IRA, Hamas or the likes of them all, all of them beneficent organizations that only want our well-being and plead the best causes in this world. With a slight inconvenience: to achieve their purposes they don't show the least respect for human rights a despicable thing of course. Consequently my comment will stick exclusively to the movie as such without making any reference to the fact that we are in the presence of Israelis and Arabs since its action could occur with any other groups with the same type of conflict. What this movie proves thoroughly is what anyone of sense already knew i. e. that these selective murders of hostages, terrorists, or secret agents not only don't solve any problem but aggravate them all by creating a spiral of violence in which one killing by one side leads to ten killings by the other and so on. The structural problems behind the conflict remain unsolved. And besides that it achieves nothing on practical terms since the murdered terrorist's and secret agents' bosses are immediately replaced by even worse ones. Furthermore we have here a technically well made movie like it is Spielberg's point of honour (by the way isn't he also a Jew?) and a well told story that may not be true in every detail but is certainly true in general terms according to what I said above. Another important feature of the movie is that terrorists and secret agents are shown not as the usual inhuman robots but as human beings with their joys and sorrows, their families and beloved ones, their weaknesses and incompetences, their doubts and uncertainties and even now and then some stings of conscience when they reflect upon what they are doing. The story has nevertheless a few gaps. Besides the apparently facility with which the location of the terrorists to kill is done as well as with which most killings are prepared and done, we never know what kind of organization was the one who informed the killers of the whereabouts of the men to be killed and what was its ideological affiliation as it seems very doubtful that they did it only for money since according to the words of one of its members and of its chief (a curious personality) they never worked for or against any government. Anarchists? We'll never know. And what kind of efficient network they had which allowed them to locate everybody so quickly? But in conclusion this is a movie made with much solidity upon a very momentous and important theme.",7,0,2,29 March 2006
300," Just only good visual impact
",We learned at school while studying ancient history that in 480 b.C. 300 Spartans commanded by their king Leonidas stood in the way of a huge Persian army in the Thermopylae pass thus preventing it of invading Greece at the cost of their lives after a fierce battle. That story is narrated in this movie in beautiful images (although some of them awful indeed) of fierce fights sometimes in an almost ballet style. It seems however that there is the intention of presenting the Greek-Persian war as a fight between tyranny and freedom (with the meaning these concepts have nowadays) which is little true regarding the epoch in question when those notions didn't exist with the meaning they have today. Sparta was an aristocratic monarchy and even in Athens (so often called the cradle of democracy) only the citizens (which were a minority among its population) enjoyed civil and political rights. Going now back to the combat scenes it must also be said that there is much fancy in them namely in the characterization of the Persian army where inclusively we can see monsters similar to those that appeared in 'Lord of the Rings'. The impersonation of the king Xerxes of Persia like an effeminate being full of piercing objects is quite ridiculous and very unconvincing. And for instance the ephors who were respected magistrates and political leaders in ancient Sparta are here presented as pestilential and repulsive priests living on the top of an almost inaccessible mountain. This movie doesn't convey therefore any solid message according to the historical truth and it's only worth by the beauty of some of its images. We must refer namely to those with the sepia tones of the old photos.,5,1,4,18 April 2007
Apollo 13," Technical and human
","This unequalled and unsurpassable adventure of three courageous men in a spatial capsule is well told whether in the technical or the human aspect. There is no detail that you can say it's out of its place in what concerns feelings or handling of all the equipments involved. It's a movie that seizes us from the beginning till the end because we feel in the skins of those men and their families that witness powerlessly down here to their drama. We can in fact discuss whether the conquest of a dead planet like the moon is worth the risk run. But that's another aspect of the question which exceeds the aim of this movie and there no room here to deal with it. Here we are in presence of the story of a human 20th century epic which is what interests and suffices us in what concerns this movie. Space is the last frontier of Man. His destiny is to search it. This movie is well directed, presented and performed.It has some wonderful and original images considering the epoch in which it was made (1995). Its last third is particularly full of real and intense suspense.",7,2,4,15 January 2008
Green Book," Curious relationship
",Indeed. An Italian-American working in a nightclub in the sixties of last century accepts the job of driver of an African-American pianist during a tour the latter is going to do in the Deep South. Their very diferent cultures and minds soon lead to situations of deep disagreement. Nevertheless as the tour goes on they begin to be closer to each other and they end up not only undertanding and respecting each other but also becoming respectful friends. This is speciallly patent when durig the tour the negro pianist is a target of racial discrmination and even of physical aggression and always gets help from his driver. A movie that shows excellently how was the American society at that time particularly in the Deep South and how the relationship between those two so different men develops itself.,8,1,2,28 January 2019

Gangs of New York," Epic but mostly gratuitous
","The movie begins with a fierce street battle between two gangs fighting for the control of a degraded New York neighbourhood: the so-called Native Americans and a group of Irish immigrants. The former win the battle and that control for the years to come. This is supposed to have taken place in mid-nineteenth century. This battle is very well filmed, directed and acted. The usual Scorsese's mastery revealing itself once more. From then on we watch the return of the young son (Di Caprio) of the immigrant leader who was killed by the Native Americans' leader during the battle. He comes out of an orphanage with the intention of revenging his father's death. The movie goes on through scenes of great realism where we see in the streets of those New York poor quarters the proliferation of a mixture of races and nationalities where the most varied gangs dominate: petty gangs, poor gangs, rich gangs, second rate gangs, big and powerful gangsters and poor thieves and robbers. But on the top of the hierarchy there is the great chief the so-called 'The Butcher' who is precisely who has killed our boy's father in the most cruel way. Till the scene of the first attempt the boy makes to kill The Butcher the movie develops itself in an atmosphere of realistic authenticity.But from then on what we watch is a series of several scenes of doubtful verisimilitude and gratuitous and meaningless violence which seem to serve only the purpose of revealing the savage and cruel nature of The Butcher. He becomes so truculent and brutal and acting with black humour into the bargain, that he turns out to be almost implausible. From a certain point on the renewed fight between the Native Americans and the Irish immigrants gets mixed in some confused way with the fight of the army conscripts (the Civil War is going on by that time) against their forced enrollment (this fact is historically true and confirmed by the way). Therefore the main value of this movie is only found in its excellent first part since in the second one it loses force in terms of ideas and verisimilitude. It ends in a somewhat clumsy and not very meaningful way in what regards the historical outcome of the fight of those two groups (if it ever actually happened any time).",6,0,0,5 December 2010
Happy Feet," Let's preserve penguins' food chain OK?
","Some of these anthropomorphic animal animated cartoons are good some are bad. This movie belongs to the former category. Although we know that these movies are no more handmade like the first Disney ones for instance and that the images are computerized, this doesn't invalidate them as forms of art since computers cannot do anything by themselves i. e. without human intervention. And this movie has got admirable and beautiful antarctic landscape images some of them breathtaking. The feelings and emotions of these humanized penguins are extremely well shown by the expressions on their faces. And the most remarkable feature of this movie in my opinion is made by the beautiful music and singing and the choreography of the tap dancing. The story is not particularly out of the ordinary in terms of plot, intrinsically pointing to the ecologic need of preserving the natural food chain so often broken by Man. This is a movie that can be equally enjoyed by adults and children.",7,0,0,20 December 2006
Slumdog Millionaire," A fancy story
","And also romantic.Around a TV show called 'Who Wants To Be Millionaire' where Jamal, a boy whose upbringing took place in a Mumbai slum but that is answering right question after question to the point of being suspected of cheating and being arrested and beaten at intervals by the police, we watch several episodes of his past and present life flashback after flashback. Those episodes show enough of the misery, violence and corruption that reign in some Indian social extracts, corruption that affects also the authorities and not only them. The images are strong and suggestive. The sound track in musical terms is of great quality. But the strong point is the suspense created around the TV contest where night after night our hero is answering right to every question trying to win 20 million rupees in the end. A well made movie that rivets our attention from the beginning to the end.",7,0,0,30 June 2017
Gladiator," Epic and cruel
","But also humane. And directed with great proficiency by the veteran Ridley Scott. The battle sequences in the beginning are great not only in every detail in close-up plans but also in general view ones. The sound track is fabulous in some scenes. The story is intensely dramatic and well conceived. Of course historic truth is not respected nor it had to be. The artist is not a historian and when he inspires himself in History to make his work he doesn't need to follow truth in every detail providing he doesn't change historical spirit or commits grave falsehood. The artist is a creator not an imitator. His allegiance is to aesthetic values not to historical superficial truth. We know for instance that Commodus was killed by his friends and his concubine Martia and not by a gladiator who was a former general, in the arena, like in the movie but we also know that he was a tyrannical despot and he liked gladiator fights very much, having in fact taken part personally in some of them. The acting is good enough perhaps with the exception of Joaquin Phoenix which is not very convincing in the role of Commodus. A good movie in general terms anyway.",7,1,2,18 May 2009
Contact," Not bad but a bit confusing
","To make a movie about this subject is difficult and daring because there is too much at stake since it deals with complex scientific aspects that cannot be lightly treated and also moral and even religious aspects of great depth. Nevertheless director Zemeckis manages to surf through these obstacles avoiding the main barriers but not without leaving a few things partly unexplained. It's the story of a lady scientist and astronomer who is fascinated by the possibility of finding extraterrestrial contacts displaying the existence of (human?) life in other parts of the universe. She meets with enormous difficulties, antagonisms and resistances on that task of hers but also some support from other people and sources. The movie from a certain point on enters in a series of unpredicted events, full of agitation and emotion in which the performance of Jodie Foster as the main protagonist is excellent. In the last part there are some scenes full of visual and factual poetry and beauty. All this, however, with a certain lack of complete explanation of a few scientific and technical details treated too lightly like for instance the building of the mysterious machine according to plans sent from Vega. And the final ending though very poetic is a bit confusing.",7,0,4,28 April 2014
Donnie Darko," Meaningless and unconvincing
",Is this a sci-fi movie? Or a horror movie? Or just only the story of a psychopathic boy prone to hallucinations? In first case it's poor in terms of invention and imagination; in second case it's not scary enough to be good; and in third case it's not bad but not good either because just only ordinary. It looks like an ambitious movie which didn't come up to its director's expectations because he is no David Lynch or Stanley Kubrick or even Steven Spielberg. The final scenes give us the impression that the movie's director didn't know how to end the story imbroglio into which he had got and then imagined some meaningless and unconvincing sequences in a Halloween atmosphere. It's the case of quoting here an old Portuguese proverb which says: this shoemaker shouldn't go beyond the slipper.,6,2,5,26 November 2008
Born on the Fourth of July," A strong libel against war
","Is there any just war? A question that can be present in this movie. A war fought 20,000 kms away from one's country might be patriotic? A war fought only for political, economic or ideological reasons can be just? An American young man is deeply patriotic and imbued with all the conventional values concerning war, joins voluntarily the Marine Force and goes to Vietnam as a sergeant. After being wounded in combat he becomes quadriplegic and returns home on a wheelchair after having spent some time in a hospital for veterans where conditions are appallingly bad even with rats running freely around. Anyway he is still defending those patriotic conventional values for what he thinks he had fought in war. However after meeting a girl whom he knew in their youth and whom he loved and seeing her being a member of an activist group against American fighting in Vietnam and seeing the police charging them violently he begins to take conscience of the real injustice of that war. After several vicissitudes of moral degradation that include a familiar conflict at home, alcoholism and an exile to a home for veterans in Mexico by a village where there is an atmosphere of alcohol, gambling and prostitution, he abandons all this and returns to USA where he joins the activist movement against war and publishes a book with his autobiography. Everything is narrated with great image and dialogue realism. The only flaw in my opinion is the not so good performance of Tom Cruise whom I never considered a very good actor and seems not very authentic, abusing some times of histrionic hysterism. Anyway a movie that can be considered a strong libel not only against the Vietnam war but against all wars.",8,2,3,14 March 2017
The Social Network," Stunning
","And fascinating, this story of how the Facebook network was conceived, born and implemented by the work of a young Harvard student against winds and tides of all kind. We see how a small computer program turned quickly into a social network of friendship congregating now more than 1,000,000 members spread all over the world, composing a nation of more inhabitants than most countries. The movie is well directed and the cut is a very effective succession of short sequences whose conducting thread consists in the depositions in the lawsuits against Mark Zuckerberg the young student above mentioned, motivated by the several legal complications his activities provoked. These sequences contain a succession of flashbacks related to the questions and references that arose during those depositions in a very vivid rhythm in which the lively dialogues and the excellent acting of all the cast members play a no less important part. I didn't cast a higher vote to this movie only because for all that its theme is not as important as to allow it.",7,1,2,7 November 2010
The Proposal," Rather funny
","But rather serious too somehow in what concerns sentiment and feelings though somewhat disguised. Sandra Bullock does a great part as Margaret Tate a driving editor at a publisher in New Yoork. She is authoritarian and always ill-looking and ill-mannered to her subordinates including her assistant Andrew. But it happened that being a Canadian her visa had expired and she must be deported in 24 hours. She then imagines a scheme that includes a fake marriage with Andrew that would allow her to stay there. Andrew is more or less forced to accept this engagement after blackmailing her in doing him some proffessional favours. But the NS agent doesn't believe them and harass them with a strict inquiry to be done in a few days. To come off well at it they simulate a bridal trip to his home in Alaska where they meet his family and a lot of funny and unforeseen events happen till a surprising end, This is a movie that puts you in in good fettle and high spirits.",7,0,0,29 May 2019
Jurassic Park," Appalling
","A gaudy and showy story but also appalling. A crazy billionnaire decides to create a jurassic park in an Island where his team starts cloning dynosaurs from ADN taken from a mosquito kept in fossilized amber and that had sucked dynosaur blood. He plans to open the park to visitors and even tourists.
Of course this will turn out badly. The huge beasts are set free when the electrical fences are put off by mistake or something else I cannot remember now and chase the visitors and the park premises.
As a matter of fact one of the characters at a certain moment doubts that it is legitimate to reverse the natural evolution process recreating species that Nature has destroyed and putting them to live together with human beings that didn't exist at the time of those extinct species.
It is a movie that is worth what is worth bur it is undoubtedly technically very good namely at the several scenes in which the animal monsters intervene and that develop themselves with a brutal and terrifying realism.",6,1,3,2 March 2018
Atonement," A simple unhappy story
","As we know impubescent children, mainly girls, tend to be mythomaniac in what concerns sexuality mainly when moved by scenes that they watch and whose meaning they don't understand or feel fully, considering his age and the absence yet of any sexual urge. This is aggravated when someone they love is involved. Then they can be led to lie and arrive to convince themselves they are telling the truth. In this movie a small girl accuses falsely a man she loves of raping a friend moved by this kind of feelings and with that she ruins her life and the lives of his elder sister and his lover, the man whom she accuses. The story is rather simple, very simply told and not original enough to deserve a high mark. However the movie is well made and worth to be seen mainly by the acting of all three main characters involved in that tragic story. The atonement suffered by the young girl develops itself through her whole life and ends in a remarkable and moving scene (the last one of the movie) in a very original way that one which makes us to wonder where reality ends and fiction begins.",6,2,4,12 February 2008
The Godfather," It's all business
","For mafia members murders are nothing but business. They never kill for pleasure. Only in case of need, cold revenge or even summary justice (punishment of traitors for instance). Besides this they all have normal family lives with most cherished spouses and children and are usually very religious making pompous wedding, christening and funeral ceremonies in the Church or under priests' directions. This reality and atmosphere is splendidly shown in this movie that Coppola directed in a superb way and with a competent and strong hand. The cast has a stupendous performance. Marlon Brando plays a magnificent part in the role of the old godfather of one of American powerful mafia families, mastering his intonation and facial expression effectively thus creating an unforgettable character in the history of cinema. The action unfolds itself along the movie in a very captivating way. I want to stress particularly the sequence of the christening in which the new family godfather (Al Pacino) makes all the oaths in the name of the child (of whom he is also the Catholic godfather) and before the priest while a parallel cut shows us all the time a series of murders of rival mafia chiefs that were taking place at same time in several other places and which had been ordered by himself. The contrast of the religious scene and the violence of the killings is really impressive and full of meaning. This is maybe the best movie about mafia ever made.",7,3,6,26 August 2007
