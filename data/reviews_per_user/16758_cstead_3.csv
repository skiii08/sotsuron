The Ring," A Genuine bed-wetter
","Has the Sixth Sense stylized horror? A genre scarred by gore in the 80's and self-mockery in the 90's seems to be taking some positive steps towards the Hitchcock masterpieces of the past. Following on from the success of The Sixth Sense and The Others, The Ring backs an intriguing mystery with some genuine scares. Already a massive success in Japan, The Ring's Hollywood makeover has maintained its allure, proving that originality isn't necessarily the key to success.Taking the premise of an urban myth, The Ring centers around a mysterious video than once observed, leaves the viewer with only seven days to live. Watts (Mulholland Dr., Tank Girl) plays Rachel Keller, a investigative journalist seeking to unlock the reason behind her niece's bizarre murder while juggling a emotionally repressed son (Hoffman) and his lethargic father (Henderson) . When she stumbles upon the video, it becomes clear that she now only has seven days to live. Thus begins The Ring.To disperse more of the plot would jeopardize a brilliant and well told succession of twists, turns and frights. The Ring is genuinely scary, working your sub-conscience into a frenzy of anticipation that keeps an otherwise quiet middle from bogging down the film. Director Verbinski (The Mexican , Mouse Hunt) is in complete control, choosing his scares with unpredictability and providing some magnificently atmospheric eye candy.The performances are excellent. Watts (looking scarily like a blonde Nicole Kidman) and Henderson (Windtalkers) are believable in their fears as the threat of the unknown drives at their splintered family. A good show from the supporting cast is only dented by Hoffman, who, despite looking spooky, comes in several shades down from the peerless Haley Joel Osment in a performance clearly inspired by the seminal child actor of his generation.Horror films have definitely made a positive leap in the last few years and despite some Hollywoodised death scenes, The Ring is a dead set bed wetter. Hard to predict, rarely does the tension let up and the ending is one of the genre's greatest leaving you, at the credits, legitimately fearful of your immediate future.

Blue Crush," Not all out to sea
","Yes, the women are gorgeous. Yes, the waves and water looks magnificent. And yes, the plot struggles to surface for air while being constantly pounded by the waves of predictability and cheesiness. Essentially, a B-grade attempt at an A-class concept, Blue Crush suffers from letting it's paralleling stories get in each others way. However, it does succeed in unearthing some of the core workings of the surfing lifestyle and it is this fact, combined with the charm of its leads, which saves Blue Crush from being all out to sea.Kate Bosworth (Remember the Titans, The Horse Whisperer) plays Anne Marie, a amateur surfer and local Hawaiian hoping to make her big break in the upcoming Pipeline Masters surfing competition. Left by her mother, Anne finds juggling work at a local resort as a maid, her sisters erratic teenage lifestyle and the need to train for the upcoming competition all too much. Haunted by the horrors of a near drowning and dogged by unpaid bills, Anne and housemates Eden (Rodriguez) and Lena (newcomer Lake) decide to give surfing lessons to a holidaying NFL team for extra money. When Anne falls for the charismatic quarterback Matt (Davis), it is time to take stock, face her fears and re-arrange her life, her priorities and achieve her destiny.Blue Crush succeeds admirably in its attempts to capture the essence of the surfing lifestyle. Getting up at dawn to check the surf, a non-challenging job, tardiness on account of the waves, local bullies and of course the guts it requires to throw your ability at mother nature and at death itself. This last point is captured brilliantly, with the sheer size of the waves and the flashbacks of Anne's life threatening wipeout rapidly driving that fear home.The surfing footage is without a doubt the most authentic Hollywood has captured. The leads look and lead the part, clearly getting physically into their parts. However, they are let down by shoddy editing (crowds in the background of isolated breaks) and a shocking level of repeat footage. Although acceptable on your run of the mill surfing video, a lot better is and should be demanded of Hollywood's finest.]Unfortunately, the sub-plot storylines of Anne's parental duties to her sister, her friendship with her flatmates and her love affair with Matt are never fleshed out enough to make a difference. Neither are they relevant, as the film begins and climaxes with Anne's need to combat and overcome the fear in herself while facing some of the largest and deadliest waves of Hawaii's famous (and camera friendly) north shore. What we have here is a great 50min flick that is stretched into a feature length through the addition of predictably cheesy soap plots.Performance wise, all 3 female leads bond and bounce of each other with the same ease and self assurance that the culture is famous for. Rodriguez especially is well cast in the meatier of the roles, however, it is a fine debut by Lake that is most likely to turn heads. Around them, competent bit parts are played throughout, although this standard drops as you continue down the line of locals pulled in for smaller parts.Blue Crush is far from rubbish. There are some genuinely funny moments and the cast garner affection, without going far enough to insult the censors. A great start and climax hold up a weak middle and predictable ending that do little more than flesh out the running time. The big question is, how do you make a consistently good  90min+ film about a surfing competition? Who knows, but when Blue Crush is in the water it excels and is well worth a visit.",7,0,0,27 October 2002
8 Mile," The Real Marshal Mathers III stands up!
","Singers should stick to singing and actors should stick to acting, but rappers, it would appear, can do whatever they want. Although far from critically successful, Ice T, Ice Cube, Tone Loc, LL-cool-J and even Busta Rhymes acquire regular billing in B-grade schlock and, at times, have all been top of their game in their primary profession. There is no doubt that Eminem is at the top of his game, so naturally, celluloid has beckoned, but there is no Eminem here, or Slim Shady, forget the monikers as it is time for the real Marshal Mathers III to please stand up, and he does.	8 Mile refers to the stretch of road that separates black urban from white suburban Detroit. In a place of poverty and crime, a man is measured be his street cred and this cred is measured by his ability to rap, or, by being a friend of a rapper. Mathers plays B.Rabbit, a white rapper with loads of untapped talent, held back by fear, his friends, his colour and domestic issues. It is a complex time for Mr. Rabbit and 8 Mile studies his struggle to raise himself above the adversities that surround him.	Thus, 8 mile is very formulaic and predictable, elevating the world of underground rapping to the same heights as nascar in Days of Thunder, Jet-fighters in Top Gun and almost every other hero-struggles-but-eventually-wins-the-day scenario. However, it is propelled above the masses by never rising above its station and by superb performances from Murphy, Phifer and Mathers himself. Scott Silver's script allows the many supporting roles to flesh out, without grabbing the lime light, but perhaps the audiences knowledge of Mather's life aids us in what is, supposedly, a semi-autobiographical movie.	8 Mile manages to present a world that many might believe does not exist by portraying it with reality and reason. There is little in the way of unbelievable theatrics and despite the massive draw power of its star, comes across more like and independent film than a Hollywood blockbuster. This is in large thanks due to Curtis Hanson whose direction is inspired. Like B.Rabbit's life, the film is gritty and dark, but allows enough humour to remind us that we are dealing with real people in a world where you never know who your friends are. B.Rabbits talent is also held back just enough to make the finale twice as rewarding, as Eminem's detractors root for Shady to cuss and rhyme more opulently than his opponent.	Obviously, in a movie such as this, music is going to play an important part and 8 mile kicks more goals than not on a soundtrack that his heaped with legends of the past (TuPac, Notorious BIG, Montell Jordan) and the present (Mathers himself). In a film with so many lyrics, the question posed is how much Mathers himself contributed to the rhymes, but they are often more witty than gross and may help to open the eyes of 혩non-believers'. There is no doubt that the 혩Lose Yourself' track and single is a killer tune and pleasantly, the 혩rap-offs' are generally left to the skills of the combatants rather that the production team and there is no D.R.E label anywhere in sight.	8 Mile is a formulaic movie that, plot-wise, comes along way from shattering the boundaries Eminem's music career has with reckless abandon, but, it does portray his world without the gloss of MTV. However, with such a mature performance, returning to that music scene and taking his lyrics seriously may become and issue for some of his fans. How could B.Rabbit be Eminem? Whether he likes it or not, the past is definitely that for the king of 혩Black' music, despite a finale which raises some possible racial concerns (white man leaving the black to the ghetto) that although subtle, are noticed. 8 Mile is a success for all concerned and I look forward to the next step in the career of this, the figurehead for 21st century culture.",8,0,0,10 December 2002
