3:10 to Yuma," The Secret deal
","I've seen this movie while ago and since this time i cant think about any other western movie that can top it. A great performance by Russell Crowe,Christian Bale and Ben Foster.. Well my best part of the movie and i call it the secret deal when Ben Wade and Dan Evans were running at the end of the trip to the train then Dan said that he ain't stubborn about keeping his family on a dying ranch and Ben saying that he have been to Yuma Prison before and Escaped twice too then we can notice the deal that was done as Dab can get the cash and be the real hero in front of his son eyes and the town also Ben can escape from Yuma Prison as he did it twice before! The movie takes as slowly through the growing relation between Ben and Dan by the time they are together to the train and which made Ben kill his guys after they shot Dan, And as a great sacrifice he got on the train after Dan's death to make the history of Yuma remember Dan and as a hint he whistle to his horse making it clear that he has the chance to escape after. Also the Great music by Marco Beltrami gave the movie the real Western Taste also the Sound Effects were great that gets u in the scenes.. I think this is a great movie with a great Performance especially by Russell Crow who acted many scenes by his eyes... If you are not a western movies fan i recommend this movie for you to watch if u care about the art and the story and the end..",9,1,2,11 February 2009
