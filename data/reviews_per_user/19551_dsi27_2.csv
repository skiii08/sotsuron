Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Overall a satisfying beginning to the Star Wars saga
","I was a little nervous about the thrashing this movie had gotten, but was pleasantly surprised when I saw it for myself.  The plot was decent enough, and the special effects were, as expected, stunning.  My main criticism, though, would be of the incredibly annoying character Jar Jar.  I understand Lucas' desire to insert some comedic relief, but he was given too many pratfalls and 'getting into trouble' scenes.  The voice is incredibly annoying, and I can't picture anyone actually approving it.  However, Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson were excellent, and most importantly, the film felt like Star Wars.",Null,0,0,21 May 1999
Detroit Rock City," Clever comedy about 70's teens quest for a Kiss show
","I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this movie.  It was filled with cleverly devised comedic spots which left me laughing out loud many times. The acting and writing were both very satisfactory, and, as expected, the soundtrack rocked.  Minimal amounts of cheese kept me interested throughout the duration of the film.  This ain't no Kiss Meets the Phantom In the Park.",9,0,1,29 July 1999
