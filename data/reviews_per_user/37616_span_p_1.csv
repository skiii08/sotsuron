E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Review of the movie: E.T.
","The first time I saw this movie I was about six or sever years old. So I know this movie like a lot of people too, but I couldn't remember everything. This movie is really one of those special ones which are classics. It's interesting, funny, dramatic and special because nobody has an E.T. as a pet at home. I think this film is for everyone it doesn't matter how old you are. At the beginning everyone was really shocked and than they taught him how to speak English. For me the best and funniest scene in this film was definitely when he is in the kitchen with the dog drinking beer. And the most emotional scene was when Elliot and E.T. were riding on the bicycle and then they started to fly. But I think that a big part of our feelings comes from the music they use for the scenes. It's a really good movie.",Null,0,0,6 November 2009
