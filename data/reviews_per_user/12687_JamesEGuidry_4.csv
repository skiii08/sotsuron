The Blair Witch Project," Origin of reality t.v.
","We all know fads have a starting point.Look at everything that's 'retro' now.Well,I'm pretty sure after the monstrous sucess of this '5-didgit budget' movie,the reality shows that now flood our airwaves first came into existence.Hey,you wanna make a buck off these poor flogs?Man,I was suckered! (for about 6 hours) BLAIR WITCH PROJECT-the #1 'INTRODUCTIONS ON HOW TO MAKE A BUCK IN THE 21st CENTURY' project.(RATING: 1 )",1,1,3,14 May 2001
The Exorcist," 3 decades standing,still the Scariest of all time!!!
","The undesputed scariest movie of all time!Even if the religious implications don't scare the 'Hell' out of you,the special effects and incredible sound tracks will invade your mind and never leave! I mean,we've all had a relative flip out before,but Come On!!!! We've all heard of one-hit wonders,but Linda Blair gets my vote for that one-time glance that you NEVER forget(from the front AND back!) The EXORCIST- the scariest movie of ALL TIME!!!!!!!!",10,0,2,14 May 2001
The Elephant Man," a masterpiece of filmmaking...
","Perhaps the greatest movie ever based on a true story.Set in black and white to capture every aspect of it's cinematography,director David Lynch makes you feel for this man to the point of tears with a beautifully simple soundtrack,incredible performances from Anthony Hopkins as the doctor and John Hurt as John Merrick(the elephant man),and the direction of David Lynch.If you had a ballot for 'Best Director'in a movie that ever existed,Lynch would be on the ballot for this movie.",10,2,3,15 February 2002
Evil Dead II," Split my gut as Ash spills theirs!!!!
","Never,in cinematic history,has a film with so much gore and so much splatter been so entertaining and hilarious!And although their are somes folks who laugh at violence for their own morbid reasons (and those,like me,who love a good Grade-B horror flick to wallup at) few can argue that Ash is,without a doubt,the #1 chainsaw-weilding, adrenaline-charged,un-luckiest hero the horror genre has ever seen!!! EVIL DEAD 2-the GREATEST COMEDY-HORROR of ALL TIME(S)!!!!!!",9,1,1,14 May 2001
