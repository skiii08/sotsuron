Casablanca," The loser who calls his shots!
","I watched a series of Humphrey Bogart movies within a span of two days: To Have and Not Have, Casablanca, The Maltese Falcon, and, Dark Passage. While the first two movies have lots of similarities, I rate Casablanca to be better. (Of course, I'm totally fascinated by the face of Lauren Bacall; but yet the role of Ingrid Bergman was more firmly planted.). My main reason for liking Casablanca over To Have... is that, in Casablanca, Bogart is a defeated man, a man running away from himself, a man who would put his 'neck out for nobody' (mainly because he's too scared to be hurt again; or in other words, his past experiences have left him synical.)...but yet he has full control over his faculties...to such an extent that when circumstances put everything at his feet, he can see through it and can decide that the victory that is waiting there to garland him won't be his triumph, but rather another, a greater defeat. And then he decides the most logical, rationale course of action that transforms him into the winner we all would like to be, and allows him to come to terms with himself.This movie deserves a place in the wish-list of every movie lover; and once it's watched, I'm sure, it would naturally be in the list of one's all-time favorite movies.",Null,1,2,31 July 2004
Finding Nemo," Finding Oneself
","I watched this movie because a friend of mine, whose taste in movies is good, recommended it to me. And she was right! I consider this beautiful movie more of family genre, rather than a children movie. It's something enjoyable for the whole family -- with a simple yet nice story of the search of a father for his 'lost' son, adorable characters (for example, the vegetarian Shark, whose 'na(i)me is Bruce') and beautiful animation. Then there is the adorable Dory, whose efforts at helping Nemo's father to locate him is often jeopardized by her short-term memory loss. Also is there the smart surfer 'dude' turtles, an exchange program that allows the young turtle to study with Nemo in his school, and the helpful pelican.As someone living in a place where seagulls often fly overhead, and thrilled by their beauty and grace, I'm now forced to remember the sail and the 'mine' 'mine' scene, each time I see seagulls.I love Dory (as everyone else does) when she forgets things, but I love her more when she pleads to be allowed to stay with Marlin, because she says, she feels as home when she's with him.This movie is about love, affection, family values, and all things positive about us, and not just about a handful of fish.",Null,0,2,1 September 2004
Collateral," Terminator revisited! (Possibly SPOILER? Humor intended)
",".... Only that this Terminator of ours has less muscle, more dialogs, and he carries smaller guns. The rest is very similar, if not exactly same  .... one guy (in fact, a Superman, whom no one's bullet would hit!) has to mindlessly kill many people, and continue the rampage from 'almost' the beginning to the finis of the movie, for whatever reasons!Other important and interesting aspects of the movie: each  guy/male character belonging to a particular community, however decent he may be all along otherwise, MUST utter, 'Motherf----r', in the movie, for example. Really great!!The only missing aspect: some tasteless and graphically vivid sex scenes! Hope the director would add those on a later date.Best wishes, then,",Null,0,0,9 August 2004
Life Is Beautiful," Holocaust Sitcom!!
","I read a lot of negative reviews about this movie before I actually watched it, and thus when I finally got a chance to watch it, my expectations were not very high. And perhaps that worked in my favor. 'Life is Beautiful' surely is not a 'must see' movie; but at the same time, it's an enjoyable one.  As far as my subjective opinions are concerned, I found the first half of the movie unnecessarily long. However, the major drawback of the overall movie (in my opinion) is that it's sort of Unicorn: neither purely a comedy nor any kind of a serious movie. Many of the situations depicted in this movie are not even within shooting distance of reality. Now, I'm willing to enjoy a comedy movie as one; but when one watches a movie that deals with a serious issue and historical facts, one expects the bare minimum reality in it. A couple of German speaking guys, a heap of bones, and couple of Magen David symbols cannot add authenticity to a movie that deals with the Holocaust. But that does not mean all is wrong with the movie. In my opinion, the depiction of the father-son relationship is one of the major plus points of this movie, and so is the portrayal of human spirit that cannot be crushed under any situation. Another plus point is that it's devoid of all those scenes in such a movie that leaves one depressed for the rest of the week (Schindler's List is a case in point).Finally, I won't recommend it to someone who really wants to see a movie that seriously deals with the history and reality of holocaust; but, at the same time, it's a good, clean and enjoyable movie.",Null,1,2,11 July 2004
The Silence of the Lambs," Have the lambs stopped screaming?
","A Must-see! And yet this is a movie, about which I read, talked with, listened from people for about a decade before I actually watched it. Actually, I read so much about this movie, searched so many different websites that I was a bit afraid that the movie won't be able to live up to the mental picture I've had of it. And yet, when finally I watched it, I was overwhelmed.Now, don't ask me who did the maximum justice to his/her role in the movie: Dr. Lecter, Clarice or Buffalo Bill, simply for the reason that I cannot decide. Many would perhaps find my view that Bill was as brilliant as Dr. Lecter or Clarice odd; but I believe that the film would not have been equally compelling without the brilliant portrayal of his role.It's redundant to talk about the brilliance of Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster. While watching the movie, one does not see Hopkins playing a role; what one sees all along is a psychopath, and yet brilliant, forensic psychiatrist. Jodie Foster was equally brilliant , one who can make a monster such as Dr. Lecter cooperate and give her clues that would finally lead her to the culprit. And it's impossible to ignore the invisible bond developing between her and Lecter during the process: her indignation at knowing that she was used to play a game of false promises (The famous scene involving, 'You've no more vacations to sell.' follows this sequence), and Hannibal's helping her in spite of the way he was deceived shed a little light on their humane side. Both of them know the wall that separates them, the circumstances that they live under, and yet none of them resists the development of the warmth between them. In a sense, they share a concern for each other.A couple of weak points of the movie in my opinion: The picking up of the pen by Hannibal (while being totally tied) in presence of Dr. Chilton, and his masquerading as an injured police officer, and then removing a mask from his face in the hospital room were unrealistic. I'm yet to read the book, and hence cannot comment if it was dramatic necessity or the director's desire to stick to the words in the book, that prompted those scenes: either way, (in my opinion) it would have been better not to have this mask sequence in this brilliant movie.People who have watched and enjoyed this movie would, I'm sure, equally enjoy Hopkins' portrayal of Hannibal in the movie, Red Dragon, as well.",Null,0,0,8 June 2004
