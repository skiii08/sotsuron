Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What are people complaining about?
","Personally, I enjoyed all the Star Wars movies (thought Episode VI not as much), and I could not understand why people bashed The Phantom Menace as much as they did. Critics say that it was slow, but then again, its a hell of a lot faster paced that Episode IV. They also hated Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best) and said that he took away from the seriousness of the movie, but what about the Ewoks? Besides, now that I watch it again, he really wasn't THAT annoying. It was also said that there was no plot and what there was was too confusing. First, its the beginning of the end, what with Ian McDiarmand acting all evil and what-not, and it introduces the bad guys AND good guys for the entire series. I found most of the acting was exceptional, especially Liam Neeson. Ewan McGregor wasn't in it that much, but he did kick...butt against Ray Park (Darth Maul) at the end. There was very good foreshadowing and, except for a couple bits with widdle Anakin and Jar Jar, this movie was right on target. I think that people expected Darth Vader to be in it, and Han and Luke and everyone, but that wasn't the story. I may be a minority with this movie, but Good job, George Lucas.",10,1,2,5 June 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," One of the best
","When i first saw Episode II in theaters, I wondered what everyone was complaining about. It was very exciting and action packed. There were lots of subtle things going on that people could easily mistake weak plot and bad acting.First, I'll start with the love story. People often said that Christenen was wooden and was a terrible actor. I found him to be very natural and, he had very realistic and human reactions and dialog. Most audiences were expecting a more heroic, easier to relate to hero than Hayden Christensen played. I thought he was very, very good. Natalie Portman was also very good in her role, and was allowed to be more natural than in The Phantom Menance.Ewan McGregor, undoubtedly, carried the movie on his shoulders. He is, quite possibly, the best actor in the entire series. On top of that, he was allowed to be much more active in this movie, speeding around the galaxy and what-not.Temura Morrison was excellent as one of the new villains, Boba Fett's father. While he died anti-climatically, he still was very cool and threatening. It was also very cool to know that the Storm troopers from the end of III, and IV, V, and VI were all based on Jango Fetts clones, who were the original 'Clone Troopers', who brought back memories of the sterile-white armored Storm troopers from the original trilogy.The special-effects in this movie, like those of the Phantom Menace and the DVD releases of the originals, were absolutely mind-blowing. The backgrounds were incredibly detailed and incredibly realistic. The chase scene through Corusant was awesome, as were all the Clone troopers (who were digitally created) and the end battle scenes. Yoda's end fight was also very fun to watch and visually amazing.I don't understand why people don't like this movie. 'Attack of the Clones' is one of the best, along with 'The Empire Strikes Back', and, my favorite, 'Revenge of the Sith'. While this movie was not perfect, I still give it ****3/4 out of *****",10,20,38,22 May 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Best of them All
","Before I even begin, I'm going to say that I'm not a huge Star Wars fan. I found that all of the reviews of Revenge of the Sith were mixed. They were black and white, either you loved it, or you hated it and wanted George Lucas to die. Personally, I choose the former.I also first viewed Star Wars (Episode IV, now) when I was a kid. No, there is no question in my mind that the 'originals' were good. But, while reading magazine articles or talking to my friends, I found that people didn't give the newer, prequel trilogy a chance. They said that there was no story, unrecognizable characters, too much special effects, and that they 'ruined the saga.' I do not agree with this general view. I prefer to view the series as a whole, rather than 'original' and 'prequel', 'good' or 'bad', 'black' and 'white.' I was fortunate enough to not watch the 'orginals' again until the special editions rolled around. (By the way, I thought that the changes made the movies better.)So when Episode I came out, I was given a generally biased view. I knew that I wasn't about to see the stories I had gotten to know. I was about to see what some people can't come to grips with: A DIFFERENT STORY. Not entirely different, but a story without Luke, Leia, Han, or Chewbacca. Personally, I enjoyed it very very much. Even more so than Episode VI, damn Ewoks.I enjoyed Episode II even more for all the same reasons. I liked the story, and yes, I thought the acting was fine. And I never thought that Jar Jar was THAT annoying. For me, it ranked up there with Episode V as my second favorite.Episode III did not disappoint me at all. In fact, it surpassed my expectations. I thought it was the best one of the entire saga. Even better than Episode IV. The effects were incredible, as was the acting, the story, the locations, and...everything. I could go on for pages describing how much I liked it and why, but its already getting a little long.So don't take my word for it. Actually see the movies. And don't watch them in order of release, instead, try to forget about the 'original' characters, and watch them in order. It will change your entire perspective of the movies. It did it for me. 10 out of 10",10,1,7,3 June 2005
