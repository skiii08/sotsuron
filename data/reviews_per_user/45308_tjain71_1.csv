The Avengers," Awesome!!!!
","I watched before some hours And I tell Only One Word ABout The Movie It Was 'AWESOME' I don't Think So That This Movie Is Better Than ThisGo to The Theaters And Experience The Most Entertaining Movie Of 2012 With Superb Actions....The characters were written perfectly, the action was spectacular and best of all ever character was a joy to watch. The story had the perfect balance of comedy, action and drama (yes, there's a bit of that too and it's good). It's everything a comic book fan would want out of a comic book adaptation movie.Every member of the Avengers line-up (whether super powered or not) got the right amount of screen time; if you were like me and thought that Iron Man would get accidentally hog the screen because the trailers made the movie look like 'IRON MAN AND FRIENDS,' your fears will be washed away.Josh Whedon pulled off the impossible; he wrote and directed a perfect comic book adaptation. He created what I consider the best superhero movie so far. He made THE AVENGERS.To say anything more would be a waste of time. Just go and watch it.",10,11,22,28 April 2012
