Hereditary," Deserves the acclaim.
","Closer to the legendary horror films of the 60s and 70s than the modern jump-scare type flicks that are popular these days. Toni Collette is outstanding, as are all the actors, but the film's scope gives them the room to perform to their best. Interestingly, this is a film with very mixed reviews here. I guess that just goes to show why Hollywood is too afraid to experiment with anything new. I do think you need to have some life experience, and a little maturity to appreciate why some of the events are truly horrific. For example, if you think that something a character does is unrealistic, and there's a particular scene that a lot of people seen to feel this way about, then perhaps as you experience more of life you'll understand why they acted that way. That particular scene I am alluding to, I think I might have done exactly the same thing. Also, it is set up like a nightmare, so some things don't quite make sense. You don't really know what is real, what is part of mental illness, what is a dream. If you need your films to lay everything out in the broad daylight and not expect you to think, then you should probably avoid this. But, please don't avoid it. Go into it with an open mind, which is the advice given in the film. Don't see it as an accurate, truthful representation of real people, but a horror film at the nexus of reality, myth, and madness. I'm not bagging the shock horror jump scare type horror films, they have a place, but this is a different sort of horror film, and if you aren't used to that type of film it might take a little more effort on your part to really appreciate, but I thoroughly encourage you to make that effort.",10,7,12,24 August 2018
