Ford v Ferrari," #FORDvFERRARI is a REALLY GOOD MOVIE!
","Friendship, family, little guys v. Corporate hacks, and the most exhilarating car race depictions you're likely to see. Bale & Damon at their best; Balfe & Jupe fleshing out roles that give the story depth, rather than filler; terrific performances by all supporting cast; writing, production, direction are all top notch. I very much enjoyed this film, and can't wait to see it again.",10,5,12,15 November 2019
