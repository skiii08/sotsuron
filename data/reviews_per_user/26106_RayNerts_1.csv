Scarface," Requires an extreme suspension of disbelief
","This movie is like the Godfather only without the class.  It's too long by an hour, pointless, and completely without entertainment value.  I was mildly amused, however, watching all of the caucasian actors pretend to be Cuban (Pacino pulls it off better than the rest, but his characterization is uneven).  And I laughed out loud when Tony sees his sister for the first time in five years and says, 'You have my eyes.'  One sentence tossed in to explain why neither looks quite like they should.",3,16,31,20 December 2003
