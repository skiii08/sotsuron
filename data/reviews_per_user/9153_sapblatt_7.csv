Vertigo," Perhaps Hitchcock's best effort
","Most critics, myself included tend to overuse the words `masterpiece' and `genius.' No adequate critique of 1958s `Vertigo' can be written without referencing the fact that the film is truly a masterpiece work from the genius director, Alfred Hitchcock.The storyline is complex in `Vertigo.' Jimmy Stewart, always one of Hitchcock's favorite actors puts on his best performance in a Hitchcock film as Scottie, a retired San Francisco detective who has vertigo brought on by a trauma that occurred on a rooftop. Scottie is reluctantly taken out of retirement when an old acquaintance played by Tom Helmore (`Secret Agent ' `The Time Machine') asks him to investigate the strange behaviors and habits of his wife, played by Kim Novak (`The Man With the Golden Arm' `Kiss Me, Stupid'.)Scottie tails the wife and is sucked into the story and of course he ends up finding the beautiful Novak irresistible. Not wanting to spoil the story for anyone who has not seen this classic I will just mention that once Stewart meets Novak the complexities and twists and turns multiply significantly.
The filming is done beautifully, particularly the location shooting near the Golden Gate Bridge and the two scenes that take place at the mission south of the city. A scene where Stewart is following Novak and she parks her car in a back alley while our detective stares at her is wonderfully honored in Martin Scorsese's `Goodfellas' in a scene where Robert DeNiro tries to lure Karen Hill (Lorraine Bracco) into an alley way so she can help herself to some stolen dresses Â– or get herself killed.Perhaps the most famous shot is the classic stairway shot filmed at the mission. Stewart has to fight his fear of heights and chase Novak up a long stairway. I am not a cinematographer, but I believe Hitchcock accomplished this by filming a Stewart going along the stairs while the camera simultaneously zoomed in on Stewart while the same camera was wheeled back and away from the subject. This creates a dizzying sense to the viewer that is meant to mimic Scotties's vertigo. Absolutely brilliant.
Also fantastically brilliant in this film and the special effects and the score. A while back, a friend's husband turned me onto the world of artist Saul Bass. Bass contributed so much to the movies and is yet not known too many. Bass was an artist who designed sets, titles and visual effects like the dream sequence in `Vertigo.' If you have seen many movies from the 1950s you know that the nightmare sequence in `Vertigo' is one of the few visual effects from any movie if this era that still works for the viewer in the new millennium. Bass was perhaps best known for his work with Otto Preminger, and he also did the titles for many Scorsese movies. Bernard Herrmann (`Psycho ' `Cape Fear (both versions' `Taxi Driver') composed the chilling and compelling music for `Vertigo,' in what I think is his best work. The music from this movie is available on a soundtrack CD.Other reviewers and critics have mentioned in the past that `Vertigo' is perhaps Hitchcock's most personal film. One could only guess that Hitchcock found this story to be a somewhat cathartic experience. Stewarts somewhat kinky, perverted scenes with Novak in where he tries to convert her into the perfect woman that was the object of his desires are at the same time interesting and unsettling to the viewer. `Vertigo' also displays some great acting, particularly by James Stewart who is pretty much in front of the camera during the entire film. Through the necessities of the script Stewart had to carry the brunt of this film, and he does not disappoint. Allegedly, Kim Novak was chosen by Hitchcock for her looks (surprise, surprise) and her performance was completely controlled by Hitchcock (yet another surprise!) Barbara Bal Geddes ably portrays Stewarts long-term artist girlfriend in waiting. It is never adequately explained why she waits and why she does not seem to mind. All in all, a great piece of work from the master of suspense.",9,5,7,4 January 2004
Scarface," Not a chick flick, no happy ending, and no sequels
","I had the privilege of watching Scarface on the big screen with its beautifully restored 35mm print in honor of the 20th anniversary of the films release. It was great to see this on the big screen as so much of it is lost on television sets and the overall largesse of this project cannot be emphasized enough. Scarface is the remake of a classic rags to riches to the depths of hell story featuring Al Pacino as Cuban drug lord Tony Montana. In this version, Tony comes to America during the Cuban boat people immigration wave in the late 1970s, early 1980s. Tony and his cohorts quickly get green cards by offing a political figure in Tent City and after a brief stay at a Cuban restaurant; Tony is launched on his horrific path to towards total destruction. Many of the characters in this movie a played in such skilled manner that is so enjoyable to watch I have forgot little of this film over the last twenty years. Robert Loggia as Tony's patron, Frank Lopez is wonderful. His character is flawed by being too trusting, and as Tony quickly figures out, soft. Lopez's right hand, Omar Suarez is portrayed by one of our greatest actors, F. Murray Abraham (Amadeus.) Suarez is the ultimate toady and will do anything for Frank; it is like he does not have a mind of his own. Tony quickly sees this and he constantly battles with Suarez, but really only sees him as a minor problem to get through on his way to the top. The character that always comes back to me as being played so perfectly is Mel Bernstein, the audaciously corrupt Miami Narcotics detective played by Harris Yulin (Training Day.) Mel, without guilt extorts great sums of money form all sides of the drug industry. He plays Tony off of Frank until it catches up with him in a scene that marks the exit from the film of both Frank and Mel. It is priceless to hear Frank asking for Mel to intercede, as Tony is about to kill him only to hear Mel reply, `It's your tree Frank, you're sitting in it.' This is from the man who Frank had been paying for protection!Tony's rise is meteoric and is only matched in speed and intensity by his quick crash and burn. After offing Frank and taking his wife and business Tony's greed takes over and he never can seem to get enough. As Tony plunges deeper into the world of drugs, greed and the inability to trust he eventually kills his best friend and his sister who had fallen in love and married. This all sets up the ending in which Tony's compound is stormed by an army from his supplier who feels betrayed because Tony would not go through with a political assassination that was ordered. This all stems form a compassionate moment when Tony refused to be an accomplice in a murder that would have involved the victim's wife and children.
All in all this is a great depiction of 1980s excess and cocaine culture. DePalma does a nice job of holding it all together in one of the fastest moving three hour movies around. The violence is extremely graphic and contains a few scenes that will be forever etched on any viewers mind, particularly the gruesome chainsaw seen, the two point blank shots to the head and the entire bloody melee that ends the movie. This is a highly recommended stylistically done film that is not for the squeamish, or for those who need upbeat endings and potential sequels; DePalma let it all fly right here.",8,0,1,3 December 2003
Taxi Driver," Someday a real rain/reign will come down and wash away
","Martin Scorese's 1976 direction of Paul Schraeder's script `Taxi Driver' depicts the decline of civilization in urban America and one man's driven obsession to clean up the defilement. The protagonist of the film, Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) cannot sleep at night and begins working twelve hour and longer shifts driving a cab in New York City. Bickle is a Marine veteran from the Vietnam era (although it is unclear if he ever saw combat) who through his daily existence observes the filth, scum and urban decay of the modern metropolis. An interesting part of Travis's observations and life is that he does not seem to notice, or care that he is a part of the same hypocrisy. He is disgusted by the city and its urchins and yet he drinks and pops pills constantly, is racist and practically lives in porno theaters during his off hours. Through all of this he reaches to try and find a real human connections.Travis is obviously lonely and seeks to find the company of a woman. A presidential campaign worker, Cybil Sheperd, infatuates him and he does well with her for one and a half dates until his moment of undoing when he takes her to the movies. Sadly for Travis, he only seems to know about porno movies and Cybil quickly leaves him. Bickle also tries to befriend the concession girl at the porno theater (Diahnne Abbot) only to have her quickly call management to remove the harassing patron. The true find and motivator to action for Travis is the twelve year old prostitute played by Jodie Foster (Iris.) He runs into her a few times early in the action and later decides that he wants to try and rescue her from the world of drugs and pimps, particularly her pimp, Sport (Harvey Keitel.)Nobody understands what is bothering Travis; not Betsy (Shepherd) or his fellow cabby, Wizard, played by Peter Boyle. Wizard seems to simplify all of the problems of the world into categories that work for him, like the notion that a man becomes his job and that all problems can be resolved by getting `laid.' Travis needs more than this to correct his problems.The acting in this film is superb all around. DeNiro, Foster and Keitel are all brilliant. Cybil Shepherd plays her role well; there is a lot of depth in the character even though she is not on screen for long. Her coworker, Tom (Albert Brooks) is so totally annoying you just kind of hope that he enters Bickle's rage. The fellow cabbies are portrayed so well and given such great dialogue I really think that they are cabbies and not actors. Like Hitchcock, Scorsese always puts himself in his own movies. In `Taxi Driver' he has more than a mere cameo as he portrays a passenger in Bickle's cab who is hell bent on setting his faltering marriage straight with the aid of a .44 magnum. Even Travis seems scared listening to his rants and raves. Scorsese should act more often.The climax is near when Bickle decides to meet with one of his colleague's friends, Easy Andy (Steven Prince.) Andy is the type of person that Travis is reaching out to destroy in this movie and yet he has no problem dealing with Andy because he will help Travis obtain the means to his end. Travis ends up purchasing a large assortment of heavy-duty handguns from Andy that he will use to invoke is reign of terror on the pimp, Sport and his associates. The ending of this movie seemed unbelievably gory and violent at the time of the movies release, and it still does to this day. The main difference is that now in the post-Bundy, Dahmer, Hinckley, Chapman, Columbine, Susan Smith, 9/11 world it is not as shocking. Post-modern society has bred a number of people who have murdered indiscriminately for no apparent reason except of their overwhelming hatred of society and their inability to fit in. I have always seen Bickle as something more than this; perhaps as the rescuer of a kid trapped in prostitution and a cleaner of street scum. But we cannot overlook Travis Bickle's flaws and contradictions. Isn't he a part of what he eradicates?",10,0,0,6 December 2003
Seabiscuit," Shallow story about a great horse
","Gary Ross's 2003 film `Seabiscuit' is a nice, albeit long family tale with little redeeming value beyond filling a much needed void for family movies when the children are too old for Disney cartoons, but too young for older fare like the `Lord of the Rings.'The story is filmed in an entertaining way and is exciting at times, particularly during the nicely filmed race sequences. At other times the movie plods along quite slowly and really avoids some of the major issues that are surrounding the main characters, namely the need to deal with loss and abandonment.Two actors truly shined in this movie Ã‚â€“ William H. Macy and Chris Cooper. Macy portrays a wondrously nervous and alcoholic racetrack announcer while Cooper depicts the talented and quiet horse trainer, Tom Smith. Jeff Bridges and Toby McGuire did not harm the film, but either through their own means, the directors or the scripts they add little to the films potential depth and merely just move the plot along.Not a great film, but worth a look on video especially with pre-teen children.",6,0,0,2 January 2004
2001: A Space Odyssey," Excellently filmed, albeit confusing
","I finally got around to watching this epic sci-fi movie by Kubrick and while I was completely awed by the camera work and special effects (not many movies from the 1960s have effects that do not look dated in 2003) I was not sure `what happened' at the end. The early plot with the apes discovering tools, and the evolution of the first tool (a bone hammer) into the `latest' tool (a space ship, and furthermore, a super computer) made sense to me I just did not get what happened when our astronaut arrived in the bedroom/womb/Jupiter.
Also, the supercomputer HAL is wonderfully portrayed and explored. I enjoyed watching HAL develop the ability to rationalize and make complex decisions. Even better was listening to HAL trying to sleaze his way out of being turned off.All in all, I am glad I stayed with it, and I may try to read the book one of these days",7,0,2,1 December 2003
A Beautiful Mind," Good, albeit overrated film
","Ron Howard admirably put together 2001's Bet Picture `A Beautiful Mind,' the story of Professor John Nash's battle against his schizophrenia. As anyone who has read my reviews knows I tend not too watch too many of these modern, major Hollywood productions and I usually find them to be too slick and with no edge. This fact, along with my general dislike of Russell Crowe had me avoiding this Oscar winner for a while.With all of my personal baggage now set aside, I must admit I enjoyed this film more than I thought I would, and even more surprisingly, I found the best part of the film to be Crowe's convincing portrayal of Nash. The depth and talent that must be utilized in order to convincingly portray mental illness must be staggering. Jennifer Connelly (`Pollock') deservedly earned her Oscar for her heart-felt depiction of Nash's wife, Alicia. The other actor that warrants mentioning is the always brilliant Ed Harris (`Pollock,' `Apollo 13,' `Nixon.') Is it just me or do others feel that if Ed Harris starred in a remake of `Plan 9 from Outer Space' it would warrant Oscar consideration? The man is an amazing talent.The area of this project that seems the most beautiful to me is the combination of Howard's direction, Roger Deakin's (`O' Brother Where Art Thou' `Fargo' `Kundun')cinematography and the editing of Dan Hanley and Michael Hill (editing team on `Apollo 13' and `Backdraft'). The way that this film depicts the inner workings of Nash's mathematical and schizophrenia is wonderfully done.",7,0,1,28 December 2003
The Producers," The Original Nazi Humor Movie
",While I find this movie a bit uneven (it picks up a good deal in the second half) it is an amazing satire of Nazism and is probably the first mainstream piece of pop culture that joked about something as serious as the Nazis and the Holocaust. It is important to remember that this movie came out a little over twenty years after WW II...considering the standards and mores of the time this movie must have hit hard...Great performances by all...particualry Zero Mostel and Dick Shaun.,8,0,0,6 November 2003
