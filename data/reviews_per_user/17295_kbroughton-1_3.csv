Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," awful
","Whenever i find a movie that makes it to the IMDb top 250 within its opening weekend, i feel like i have to see it. This one i wish i would have never looked up on here. i had never heard of it, and was curious about it. i saw a top 250 rating and thought i should check it out. If this movie belongs in the same category and the legendary greats then i really missed something. It was funny in select scenes but other rip off movies like Jackass, Dumb and Dumber, and all the Jay and Silent Bob features are crucially more entertaining while maintaining humor. Comedies today make me sick, and this is one movie that should have never been made.",1,183,364,17 November 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," In The Fashion of other Greats
","This movie is truly one of the great movies of the last decade. I cannot remember a time when I went to a movie without knowing much of what it was about and left the theatre mesmerized. This is movie that plays on the viewer wits and dares them to keep up. In the end for those who are too slow the plot is finally revealed. I wished the last would have been left up to us to decipher, but in the end the movie is great. I personally would put it into my top 25 list. It is a mixture of Hitchkock's North By Northwest, Terentino's Pulp Fiction, and Singer's The Usual Suspects. But don't get me wrong, it does not exceed any of these films. But this is a work of art to be talked about in the same perspective.",10,1,7,24 April 2006
Unbreakable," Great Movie
","Unbreakable is a film that some of its predecessors like Pulp Fiction, and the 6th Sense, builds its plot mostly around dialog. If you are wanting to see a film full of action this isn't the film for you. But if you like a movie that spends a lot of the film in character development, subtle suspense, and thought provoking then this film is a great.Is the world that we live in balanced? If you have the color white then it is balanced by black. A male balanced by female, day by night. This is one of the themes of the movie. If a person is born with a disease of very fragile bones, so fragile that the slightest tough will break them, then does his opposite exist as well. Based on the patterns of nature then it must. Another aspect that makes this film great is the filming. The movie is based on the premise of comic books, and each scenes looks as if it is captured in frames. Its like your looking at a comic but instead of it being frozen frames, there is movement. Other aspects from comics can be associated with the film as well. In most comics the super hero has a first and last name that starts with the same letter or sound. Superman was Clark Kent, Spiderman is Peter Parker, Here the heroes name is David Dunn. Comics also use color to represent main characters within the story, Mr. Glass always has the color purple, David Dunn green, and many others in the movie have a particular color scheme.This is one of my favorite films and would recommend it to any person who claims to be a movie fan. It takes you on a ride that keeps you on your seat guessing what is really true. It puts you in the world of a comic book, but seems like an everyday occurrence.",8,1,1,27 April 2006
