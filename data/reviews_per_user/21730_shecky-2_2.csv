The Blair Witch Project," Funny, Innovative, and Damn Scary
","[Editor's note: this comment contains a minor SPOILER]What's scarier than Freddy, Jason, and Michael Meyers?  What you can't see. The dark.  The noises in the dark.  The unexplained.This is the concept behind the Blair Witch Project.  I won't say much on the film, just a few notes, because it is the first film I've ever seen that one must experience for oneself before one can truly enjoy it.You never see the monster.  You never see death.  All you see is dark.  All you hear are things that go bump in the night.  The scariest moment of the entire film, the moment that really sent a chill down my spine, is seeing Mikey standing in the corner of the basement, as you see the last few seconds of Heather's videotape.  Before it drops.But we don't see the monster.Not only does this prove an excellent effect, but the way in which the entire film was made.  All improv.  The actors never told what was going to happen.  Filming it themselves.  This is the reason the film REALLY works. We can feel the insanity the lost students go through.  We can relate to them when they scream at each other.  And, it's funny because it's the same way we would react.  The funniest moment of the film is when the brightest ray of light in the four days lost kids house is when they find a pack of cigarettes.  And, as a member of the audience, you feel the little bit of joy they have.That is all that can be said.  Live it for yourself.  Feel it's fear.",10,1,2,2 August 1999
American Pie," Entertainment for Entertainment's Sake
","Okay, I've never seen Porky's.  Not on video, I've seen it on TV.  Every reviewer in the country is calling American Pie 'rehashed Porky's.'  And yeah, it might be, but who cares?  It's a new generation, and, to be quite honest, American Pie was good.  Damn good.  Entertaining and everything.What distinguishes American Pie from other high school comedies?  There's no unlikeable characters.  It gives you such a great feeling because you've known the characters in the movie when you were in high school.  The characters do what you expect them to do.  When Jason Biggs' character has a naked girl in his room, you yell at the screen for him to go to her, just like his friends persuade him to do.The dorky guy that you know is lying about having sex, the butthead athlete that you like because he's so funny and stupid, the pretty cool athlete that straddles being king of the school and being himself, the guy who is just obsessed with sex, the dorky guy that hangs out with the semi-popular click, the couple that has been dating forever but aren't having sex, the chick that is so smart about life, the band geek that's got a wild streak. These are all characters we've known, and that's why it's easy to relate to them.The power of American Pie is that it is not an artistically done movie, and it doesn't try to be.  It knows it's not going to win any awards.  It is a low-budget comedy with Eugene Levy that's main purpose for existence is to entertain.  And really, isn't that what all films should do?",9,0,0,11 July 1999
