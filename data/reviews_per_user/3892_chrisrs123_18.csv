Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Definitively the worst Star Wars
","The film that should have launched Star Wars films into the modern era, The Phantom Menace is probably the definition of disappointment.To be fair to it, it's not the worst film ever made. There are positives. Liam Neeson delivers a charismatic and memorable performance as Qui-Gon Jinn while Ewan McGregor is also entertaining to watch as a young Obi-Wan Kenobi. Darth Maul is a physically threatening villain with a cool design, just a shame they couldn'y find any dialogue for him or any sort of personality. The choreography of the fight scenes, particularly the final lightsabre battle gets a thumbs up, despite the bizarre forceshield triggered breaks in the duel. The visuals generally are nice to look at. In fact the film starts and ends with promise.Unfortunetely there's a middle that takes up 90% of the runtime where nothing much happens. Unmemorable characters waffle on about nothing, borderlinecaricatures wander in and out of the movie, most notably the abominable Jar Jar Binks, an annoying child asks if Natalie Portman is an angel, is declared the chosen one and wastes 7 hours of screentime podracing to sell video games. The dialogue sounds like it was written by a 5 year old on meth using a speak and spell. It's just such a boring slog to get through. By all means watch clips on youtube of the good bits, don't bother sitting through the whole film.The one aspect of the film that is truly phenomenal - the music. John Williams saves the day with a perfect soundtrack including classics like Duel of the Fate. Pity there's a film attached really.",3,1,2,25 February 2020
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Boom! That's how it's done!
","Rogue One may be my favourite Star Wars movie. It's smart, funny, dark, gritty, exciting and tragic all at the same time.The designs in it are awesome, and Jyn Erso is an instant hit as the film's lead. Cassian and K2 provide the perfect back up for her, Cassian used to inject a little darkness into the light of the Rebellion and K2 bringing the humour. The rest of the team are fun but inevitably less mmorable given there's only one film to get to know them. Where the film really shines though is its villains. Ben Mendehlsson portrays their nemesis Director Krennic, and is one of the best Star Wars villains we've had - the perfect mix of villainy and humanity. The ghost of Peter Cushing stands behind him with the CGI reconstruction of Grand Moff Tarkin - a very impressive feat and perfect return for the original imperial officer. Perhaps its greatest accomplishment though is Darth Vader - swaggering back onto the big screen, more dangerous than ever, and stealing the film with only a couple of short scenes. That last scene though is the one that has had everyone talking ever since.The film gives us a chance to see the darker reality of the conflict between Rebels and Imperials, showcasing the futility of Rebellion and the power of hope side by side. It feels real in a way perhaps no other Star Wars film does. Bravely, it doesn't shy away from the inevitability of its ending, embracing it in a powerful show of a true last ditch attempt and one of the most moving battles in sci fi cinema.Freed from the constraints of the Skywalker saga, Rogue One feels free-er to do its own thing and stand on its own two feet, but its close proximity to the main series is its strength, feeling relevant in a way Solo didn't and far more powerful.It might be a little long, slowing down a bit in the middle, and the darker nature of the film might not be to every Star Wars fan's taste but for me: Rogue One stands out above the rest at the top of my most-likely-to-rewatch list.",9,0,2,27 February 2020
Knives Out," Enter: Benoit Blanc!
","I had no idea what to expect except Captain America telling people to eat $#*/ but it delivered that and so much more. Rian Johnson does his thing, subverting the detective genre and its a perfect fit. Smart, stylish writing, perfect performances, a lot of laughs, and an engaging memorable plot, Knives Out is the most fun I've had at the cinema in a long time and I can't recommend it enough.",10,2,5,24 March 2020
Moana," Great!
","A whole lot of fun with strong lead characters, a simple and effective story, lovely visuals and great music. A top quality Pixar movie with a lot of heart and humour.",8,0,1,28 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Hilarious, bizarre and a little bit brilliant!
","As trilogy cappers go, Return of the Jedi does feel a bit like they stopped taking it seriously. I mean firstly, what on Earth is Luke's plan in those Jabba's Palace sequences? Let's all go in one by one and get captured then see what happens? Secondly: remember our cool new villain Boba Fett that's really popular? Let's have a blind man accidentally knock him into a giant hole in the floor 15 minutes in. Third: the Ewoks. Because what Star Wars really needed was a race of space teddy bears that throw rocks at highly trained soldiers and worship C3PO as god. And let's not even mention the out of nowhere, clearly unplanned reveal that Leia is Luke's sister which makes certain scenes in the last two... at the very least odd to watch.It's so ridiculous the whole way through, you'll find yourself laughing along - potentially at rather inappropriate moments (many Bothans died to bring us this information). It's also though, undeniably, a whole lot of fun. And actually a more than satisfactory conclusion to the trilogy and, for a long time, the whole saga.",8,0,0,27 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," It's an ending Jim, but not as we know it.
","So does the Skywalker saga end with a whimper or a bang? Um. Yes.Let me just start by saying I love Avengers Endgame. What does that have to do with this film? Well apart from Rey declaring I am Iron Man and snapping her fingers to turn Palpatine into dust at the end, very little. And that's sort of my first problem with it: expectation. I went in expecting Star Wars: Endgame and that's not what this film is, despite the trailers leading you to believe that. It is in fact, Return of the Jedi 2 with less partying at the end.As I said in my Return of the Jedi review, they stopped taking it seriously, did some ridiculous rubbish, and had a lot of fun in the process. This is pretty much the same vibe. Things come out of nowhere (Rey is a Palpatine what now?), things don't really add up (what exactly was Finn trying to tell Rey near the start?), things don't have consequences (Chewbacca and that blood y second shuttle), and quite frankly what on earth was Palpatine doing: sending out vague threats of revenge off screen, burying some star destroyers for a dramatic reveal, giggling behind Kylo Ren's back because he may or may not have wanted him to do what he was doing, and then just sitting back and chilling until the last ten minutes.It's a mess, but on second viewing I can confirm, it's a highly enjoyable mess because it's all about the fun! Rey, Finn and Poe are reunited and on top form, C3PO is having a whale of a time, Lando is back and living up to all our memories of him, Kylo Ren is suddenly... likeable? (Never thought that would have happened), Palpatine is back for a laugh and he's recruited Richard E Grant to replace the laughing stock General Hux became. We're revisiting the moon of Endor, we're having force visions, Poe's getting some backstory, Leia's being retroactively Jedi-ed. It's nuts. But it's definitely entertaining.On the negative side, the whole thing does start to drift from feeling like an Indiana Jones adventure into feeling more like an annoying video game quest. But it snaps out of that. And the ending is a bit underwhelming (Needed more yub nub).But on the positive side, the scene where Kylo talks to his memory of his dad was an unexpected and moving delight (Harrison Ford has still got it), and the film actually made me like Kylo Ren. Plus I definitely heard Ewan McGregor whisper something to Rey near the end, and I'm willing to put up with a couple traumatic Hayden Christensen flashbacks and if I can have some Kenobi ones too.It's far from perfect, but it's fun and enjoyable and once I knew what to expect from it, I was happy.",8,3,18,29 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A bizarre mix of good fun and terrifyingly painful rubbish
","Attack of the Clones is undeniably a film. Beyond that it's quite hard to define anything. The film veers wildly from engaging and exciting to vomit-inducing. It basically comes down to: are you watching Ewan McGregor or Hayden Christensen.Let's get the garbage out the way first. Nobody can sell dialogue like 'I don't like sand' and make it seem like a love story worthy of the stars but Christensen manages to go above and beyond, finding a way to deliver dialogue so it sounds even more appalling than it was on the page. As Anakin Skywalker, he gives perhaps the least charismatic and enjoyable performance in cinema history. He's helped in his quest to create the worst movie experience imaginable by Natalie Portman doing her very best to win 'least interested actress in the world' award. Their love story and the half of the film it takes up can accurately be described as the worst form of torture and should be outlawed by the geneva convention.On the other hand, Ewan McGregor gives a winning performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi, delving into a genuinely engaging plot involving the bounty hunter Jango Fett (Temeura Morrison) and a mysterious army of clone soldiers.For most of the film, we're dealing with a film of two halfs where sadly the bad of one half vastly outweighs the good of the other. Christopher Lee rocks up two thirds of the way through when they remember they're meant to have an actual villain for the movie but it's not enough to save it and you'll find yourself actually rooting for the arena monsters to kill at least two of our three protaganists.Then Mace Windu shows up on Geonosis to declare this party's over and suddenly everything changes. The last leg of the film sees clones, droids, jedi, a purple lightsabre, a sith lord and Yoda flipping around like there's no tomorrow. It's non-stop action that delivers everything you wanted and leaves you genuinely excited to see more of this Clone War (Dave Filoni's got you covered). If the film was just those 30 minutes I'f give it at least 8 stars.Basically, fast forward all the bits where Hayden Christensen says or does anything and you may well enjoy this film!",5,2,3,29 February 2020
Toy Story 4," Goodbye Woody, my old friend
","A fun Woody focused epilogue to the Toy Story films with a moving message about letting go and moving on. It's not as strong as the first three but it's still great and really resonated with me. Woody is a true hero with such loyalty, and he finally gets his reward and to finally rest.",8,0,0,28 March 2020
Big Hero 6," Babemax
","It's a decent though unmemorable and plain superhero film but with the now well-eatablished gorgeous Pixar look. What really makes the film shine though is the instantly winning character of Baymax, who will appeal to adults and children alike, elevating the whole thing from just quite good to really good. Stick with it until Baymax is there",7,0,0,28 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Rian Johnson Experiment
","The sequel trilogy's 'Empire Strikes Back' chooses not to follow the Force Awakens model of updating the existing story, instead taking the darker themes and style of risks and do something completely new. Can you hear the fanboys screaming yet?How does it work out then? Mixed results. Rian Johnson chooses to subvert all expectations and take every moment that could be something predictable and flip it on its head. It's a clever film making strategy but it doesn't quite work for Star Wars - a film series built on those big moments Johnson avoids like the plague.Rey, Finn and Poe are, as you would expect, great fun to watch. The three are separated the whole time though so the fun is significantly diminished without the chemistry of their interactions.These also leaves the story fractured in 3 and as is often the case with Star Wars, these plots aren't of equal quality.Poe is left to joust with Admiral Holdo for command in the slowest least urgent space chase of all time. There's some fun but it's mostly just people stood talking about dramatic things happening around them.Finn goes on a mission with new girl Rose that involves faffing about in a casino and crying about slavery (boring) and then infiltrating a first order ship and fighting Captain Phasma (exciting!). Boyega delivers a great performance and there's nothing wrong with Rose (no matter what the internet says) but he just doesn't have the same chemistry with her as he did with Daisy Ridley last movie.Finally, Rey is left to try and reawaken the broken spirit inside Luke Skywalker while dealing with her apparent force bond with Kylo Ren. Here the film shines and Johnson's subversion of what we expect from a Skywalker is perfect. Luke Skywalker might be a legend but he's also human. And it makes it all the more worth it when he arrives to save the Rebels at their last stand, walking out to face down an army of AT-ATs alone.The film stops asking us to take its villains seriously as Snoke is dispatched with ease, Hux is victim to a classic your mum prank and Kylo Ren embraces his inner drama queen. It works better than the last film but does leave us wondering who to take seriously for Episode IX's grand finale. (Luckily JJ has a Palpatine shaped answer under his sleeve ready to declare it's treason then and do a 920 spin from prone.)Ultimately the problem with the Last Jedi is that as the filling in a JJ Abrams sandwich it feels weirdly out of place and ignored. It's the odd one out of the saga, and the majority of its impact ultimately ends up meaning nothing.The Luke Skywalker plot is some of the best Star Wars we could have asked for and that Yoda scene is perfection. Sadly the rest of the film around just doesn't quite fit.",7,3,15,29 February 2020
Brave," Odd but amusing
","I went into this film not really knowing to expect. I certainly didn't expect thr plot to be 'a girl turns her mother into a bear and has to deal with the consequences.'It has some Pixar spark with a lovely look to the film, some good humour (mostly the dad and the 3 little brothers) and some decent ideas.It also however takes the classic 'young girl who doesn't want to get married' and does pretty much nothing interesting with it. The story never really goes anywhere from there, it just um... turns into a bear.It's bizarre but also uninventive with very little to say.",5,0,0,25 March 2020
Alice in Wonderland," Too Sensible?
","It looks brilliant and most of the characters feel true to the book, even if darkened, depthened and Burton-ised. The story isn't really Alice in Wonderland but rather a sort of grown up sequel. It's very pretty, it's fun, it's inoffensive, and it's enjoyable. It's also simple and largely sensical which is really the opposite of Alice in Wonderland. It's a good film, it's a good idea for a return to Wonderland story, it's a great cast, but it's too safe and simple to stand out or feel like it fits in the magical nonsense of Wonderland.",6,0,0,25 March 2020
Beauty and the Beast," A visual treat once it gets started
","The film starts slow and uninspiring but after not too long we finally reach the Beast in the Castle and the film gets started. The story is almost identical to Disney's original animated film, so it's best to think of it as the same film turned into live action rather than its own thing, but it's a good adaptation. The performances are mostly great, particularly Ewan McGregor as Lumiere stands out. Gaston lacks the fun and charisma of his animated counterpart, and his sidekick doesn't really get much of a chance to be amusing, but apart from that all the performances are strong. It's nice to see Emma Watson and the others but what really sells the film is the impressive and stylistic visual look to the film - quite simply, it looks really good. It's not something I think I'll revisit, but it was an enjoyable film and I will remember it. If you're a fan of the Beauty and the Beast story then you'll enjoy seeing it realised so capably.",6,0,0,24 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Pigs are flying and hell's frozen over
","One of the Star Wars prequels is actually... good?! I'm in shock.Don't get me wrong, Hayden Christensen is still appalling but he's not AS bad as in the last one and they've basically got rid of Natalie Portman by making her the stay at home pregnant wife then too sad to live.Revenge of the Sith is a genuinely very fun and enjoyable film with memorable moments, genuine emotions, and strong main characters.Christopher Lee's Count Dooku is quickly dispatched but General Grievous proves an effective and more memorable villain to represent the Separatists. The true villain of the film (and the series) shines though as Ian McDiarmid brings Chancellor Palpatine/Darth Sidieous to life as one of the best villains in cinema history. Even Hayden Christensen as a younf Darth Vader is quite good most of the time - turns out anger is the one emotion he does know how to display (some of the time anyway).As for the heroes, Ewan McGregor moves from good to outstanding this film, with Obi-Wan's role as a war hero explored, his friendship with Anakin effectively delved into, and the raw emotion of the character as the film goes on expertly portrayed. Frank Oz as Yoda is predictably iconic and delivers everything you want from our little green friend. Even smaller roles like Mace Windu and Bail Organa shine.As for the plot, you can probably see most of it coming a mile off but that doesn't make the turning point any less moving. Order 66, particularly with John Williams' as-ever excellent soundtrack, is one of the best scenes in Star Wars. The dialogue finally hits the right balance between ridiculous and dramatic to fit Star Wars with, sure, some stinkers, but also a lot of memorable quotable dialogue.Stand out though is our final battles between Yoda and Palpatine, and Obi-Wan and Anakin. The Mustafar battle particularly stands out as just exceptional - entertainment rarely gets better than this.There's still a fair number of flaws (did I mention Hayden Christensen enough yet?) but it's a highly enjoyable sci-fi experience and I love Ewan McGregor (and his beard) more than words can express.",8,0,0,25 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," What a comeback!
","It's not difficult to see why Star Wars was dying. The prequels were never going to capture any child's imagination in the same way as the originals - full of wooden characters, trade negotiations and uninspired cgi overload. There were features of interest, but Star Wars was on the edge of death.Episode VII however relaunches the franchise with style, breathing new life into it. Our new lead characters are instantly engaging and likeable: Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) are charismatic and inspiring (in all the ways Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman weren't).The story is fast paced and exciting, showcasing a galaxy far far away without overdoing it. It's basically the plot of a New Hope but on a bigger scale but this keeps things safe and there's enough twists on the story to keep it fresh and exciting.The only real weakness is the villains - shouty holographic Snoke is about as far from scary as you can get, General Hux is the least threatening villain yet, and Kylo Ren.... oh dear. He had me intrigued for the first half, but once the mask was off and it was revealed we were dealing with a whiny emo teenager, it's just impossible to take him seriously. At the very least, Adam Driver makes something of it and we at least get some actual acting rather than Anakin whining about sand again.The strength of the film is in its heroes though and our three new leads are joined by some old friends too. Seeing Leia, Chewbacca and C3P0 (if you recognise him) is great, but the real star of the film is Harrison Ford - Han Solo's swansong is a worthy one and his death is possibly the saddest scene in all of Star Wars.In short, JJ Abrams' vision of Star Wars is just too cool and exciting to ignore, and with this film he just saved an entire franchise.",9,2,19,29 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," You never forget your first time
","The first Star Wars film showcases the best aspects of the film series right from the start. It's not hard to see how it has evolved into such a huge franchise.The first time you meet Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca and old 'Ben' Kenobi, you'll fall in love with them easily and right from the start. Darth Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin loom as the villains of the film and you won't forget them easily. The concepts behind these alien worlds and space stations is impressive. The dialogue is fun and memorable. You'll be humming the music all day.It has aged as a film - the battles don't hold up compared to later films. Kenobi vs Vader looks like two old men poking each other with sticks compared to even just the very next film. Some of the lines and actions are questionable (only imperial stormtroopers are that accurate). The plot of the film is very simple and has a much less epic feel and scale that you expect from the following films. But this all adds to a warm small scale feeling that you're watching something very special.On its own, the film is probably more of a 7 star affair, but the nostalgia and the iconic feel and nature of the film boost it as a viewing experience. Hearing those lines said for the first time that everyone can quote on the streets nowadays with everyone smiling when they hear them is a thrill like no other.",9,0,0,27 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," A well earned reputation
","Empire Strikes Back delivers a larger scale, more mature sequel that ticks every box. It's darker but still a lot of fun, it's upped the scale and quality of everything it delivers. Planets like Hoth, Dagobah and Bespin have stuck in fans' memories ever since. The main cast all return, just as good as the first time we met them, this time joined by Lando Calrissian, the smoothest man alive, and Jedi Master Yoda who I'm sure needs no introduction. On the villains front, Darth Vader is joined by Boba Fett - a brutally effective bounty hunter of few words.It's a cool cast, spread out across a large galaxy that really feels like the perfect setting for the epic space opera. The twists keep coming, now well known by pretty much everyone but for a new viewer entirely unfamiliar with them they were absolutely groundbreaking. The action's stepped up since the original - Skywalker vs Vader putting the last film's lacklustre lightsabre duel to shame. The music's as beautiful as ever.The original trilogy are all highly enjoyable films but Episode V has the reputation as the best of them and it's entirely possible that might well be the truth.",9,0,0,27 February 2020
Incredibles 2," Incredible!
","A great superhero adventure with a real human side to it, rendered beutifull by Pixar just like the first one. It's a bit more predictable and less original but it's a great sequel. Screen-Slaver was a great creepy villain (although the twist was obvious) and Elast-Girl is brilliant as the hero lead. Meanwhile Mr Incredible takes on the family side of the film and seeing his struggles as a dad are hilarious and heartwarming. There isn't an out of place feminist message like some people claimed, they just play with gender roles a bit and dare to have a female character in a lead role. Really enjoyed this film, would recommend.",8,2,2,28 March 2020
