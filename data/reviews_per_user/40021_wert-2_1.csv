Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Amazing Sensory Experience, with a catch.
","First off, this is a fantastic movie. All the sounds, music, and visuals are top notch. Unfortunately, in comparison to the original trilogy, I believe it is more kiddied down. By that, I mean there are many places where you just think 'ahh, that part is for the kids'. To draw from another series, just think back to that feeling you got when Wesley Crusher would make an appearance on an episode(you may know him as... 'The Boy?!?!'-Worf).",7,0,0,19 May 1999
