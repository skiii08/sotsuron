Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," One of a kind - I like!
","Sacha Baron Cohen (better know as Ali G) presents Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, a classic in the making.Sacha Baron Cohen goes where no other comedian dares, bringing a film that is like no other as it delivers dozens of laughs and plenty of disgustingly outrageous scenes.To sum up (without spoiling) Borat travels across America meeting many types of people, and offending many types of people. The film is an absolute must.It's gut-bustlingly funny, it's highly offensive it's one of a kind - worth 80 minutes of anyone's time, 9/10",8,1,6,28 December 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Chaos Theory - all will become clear
","Lucky Number Slevin is a great stylish action with interesting and well thought out parts and is bursting with many great Hollywood actors including Josh Hartnett for the leading role. The film has a sometimes complicated and fast paced plot where you can loose yourself sometimes but great none the less. Lucky Number Slevin is the sort of film where at the end of the film everything 'should' fall into place and become clearer.To simplify (without spoiling) Slevin (Hartnett) finds himself at the wrong place at the wrong time and ends up within gang business.Blending great actors and acting, a few laughs, gun's n' ammo, and a wonderful, exciting, chaotic plot, all a movie lover needs to slap a cheesy smile on their face in enough time to find another flickÂ…..8/10",8,0,1,31 December 2006
United 93," Emotional
","United 93 is one of the most emotional - eye opener of a film I have personally seen. United 93 gives you a good perspective on the 911 bombings, detailed with how horrifying the event was. This is a gut churner of a film, which makes you put yourself in the passengers shoes and to think what it must have been like for the hostages on board. The film leaves you speechless and makes you feel lucky for who you are. The film will get a good response from the public (especially the Americans) for the event that it covers as it was a sudden and horrible event that broke many hearts.A great eye opener, simple but effective - 8/10",8,3,6,17 January 2007
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Better than the first - Miracle!
","To be honest I thought that Ice Age 2: The Meltdown wouldn't top the first, but as always I was wrong, it was actually better that the original. I predicted about a six for Ice Age 2, I thought it would turn out alright but no as good as the first. It turned out differently, it was actually very good, probably one of my favourite animations among with the incredibles.What I like about Ice Age 2 is that there is more to the plot and more going on, there is more characters and most importantly, it was funnier than the first title.John Leguizamo plays a fantastic part of the voice of 'Sid' Ice Age wouldn't be the same without him.Funnier than the first, bigger and better than the first! - 8/10",8,0,1,2 January 2007
Saw III," The goriest so far
","NO SPOILERS I really enjoy the Saw films, Jigsaw has the most beautiful killings! I couldn't wait to see Saw 3, and now I have seen it, it was very good. I don't think it was quite as good as the first Saw simply because the first was such a one of a kind for it's time, and had a mind blowing ending, but however it did top the 2nd Saw movie.Saw 3, as you can expect from the saw movies has a great plot, extremely gory scenes, some great deaths and I fantastic ending. I think Saw 3 is the goriest so far out of the 3.Conclusion: Saw 3 has enough up it sleeve to impress any saw fan (it's not for the squeamish!). Again, brilliant plot, gore and ending - 8/10, can't wait for Saw IV!",8,0,1,22 January 2007
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," What a performance! - 10/10
","I had seen One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in the top 250 on this site, and I looked at the plot, stars and year and I thought it would just be one of the many old, long and boring films.One day I managed to pick it up cheap, as I wanted to watch it just out of curiosity, to see what it was actually like.It turned out to be one of my all-time films. Before I watched it, I was actually rather unfamiliar with Jack Nicholson (the main star) and he actually turned out to be quite a good actor.I like the film so much as it is funny, well made, simple and contains good actors and plot. I can now see why it has a position in the top 250, as it deserves it! worth the watch - 10/10",10,0,2,9 August 2006
Speed," To me - a absolute classic
","I first saw speed when I was only young, at that age I wouldn't have know a good movie if it hit me.But now I'm older and I have watched it many times since, and I can respect a good movie and know what makes one. Keanu Reeves (the main star in speed) is not a bad actor in this film, but like all actors, they have done their fair-share of rubbish (in Keanus case - Constantine). Other actors of speed include Dennis Hopper (the bad guy), Sandra Bullock and Jeff Daniels, so director Jan de Bont has managed to put together some decent actors.In conclusion - a worthy action/thriller with a simple plot and good actors, - 9/10, (dont bother even thinking about Speed 2: Cruise Control)",9,0,0,13 August 2006
Click," One of Sandler's best
","My first impressions of click wern't exactly good, I thought it would just be another Sandler spin-off ending with a cheap smile and a regret for going to see it.But all is not doom and gloom! After seeing the film, it actually turned out to be quite good! What made it a worthy 7/10 was that it was one of the funniest films I had seen in a while. With a couple of laugh-out-loud scenes.Unfortunately, I cannot go higher than a 7, simply because we are talking about Sandler here, not the best actor in the world, although (all due respect) made me laugh, and not forgetting the Hoff who didn't do too bad! One of sandlers best! - 7/10",7,0,1,29 October 2006
