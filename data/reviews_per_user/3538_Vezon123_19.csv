Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," The End?
","Wait, wait, wait, I think it's one of those rare cases where the continuation of the original better. In defense of the painting in 2009 I can only say that it was the first and presented to the audience modernized Sherlock Holmes. What we will show today? Watson married, Professor Moriarty wants to unleash the First World War, and Holmes is on a diet of coffee, tobacco and coca leaves.Scenario - a great chess game between Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty. But right on red. As you must remember, a professor in the first part of a system of wireless detonators stolen and used it in this part, rather obviously did not apply, you can invent things. In the 'Game of Shadows' Dr. Evil, he who tries to knock their heads against the two powers, I will not name names, but I will say that one country spoke French, and the other in German. It would seem, why should he? Yes, just part-time professor and another 'Lord of War.' A Sherlock acts as a catch-up - to calculate the great professor of mathematics - mission impossible.The visual component - Guy Ritchie, getting the budget by about a third more than in the first part, so turned around that ... in short it must be seen. The scene in the woods, in my opinion, generally the most beautiful of those I've seen this year. Slo-mo, explosions, scattering trees, the big guns for the last time so I cut off the brain, only a third of 'Transformers.' Winter blockbuster, but with a firm sense of humor and a director Ritchie. At least a gypsy camp ...The actor - ... (hello, 'Snatch') and wait for what is now the scene Brad Pitt is out, and goes 'Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' Numi Rapas. No, this is not a film about which you're thinking. The charming young fortune-teller seeking his brother, who is the key to a great mystery of Dr. Ha ... Holmes. Vasily Livanov before the release of the first part said: 'All the bad guys!' When he was invited as a consultant in Hollywood. Later, Robert Downey Jr.. refuted this statement, creating a distinct character. The second part of the missing spark in his eyes, but the game is also good. You can not say about Jude Law - replays. Of course, Guy Ritchie puts everything in such a way that at first glance it is not noticeable, distracted by the beauty, the passions, special effects, but for now, promatyvaya again, these scenes in your head, you notice - something was not right.Finale - 'bomb disposal' - all, the audience leaned forward. The atmosphere was tense to the limit, the pawn on e4, elephant elephant beats, the Shah, who watched 'Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson: Mortal Combat' or read a book, understand what it's all over, I'd add that touched to tears, but at 2014 has already announced the third part of Robert Downey Jr. adventure. So what? This is not the end?",9,0,1,30 December 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," At world's End
","Rent 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl Gore Verbinski trusted after his success in the lucrative financial terms of adaptation of Japanese horror mystical' Call '. I remember his fortune after seeing the 'Curse of the Black Pearl.' Definitely it was a know-how in mainstream cinema, which I have never seen before. An exciting adventure that is not erased from memory even after a week. It seems that the story is over, Jack in freedom, Will and Elizabeth - the happy couple. But no ... Fast smeknuv that half-baked creation of the 'great and terrible' Jerry Bruckheimer stable, and in huge quantities brings money, the producers began to stir, and three years after the premiere of 'Damnation ...' presented to the audience, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest.' Compared with the first film, the story sequels (well trikvela the same time) has become more complex, confusing and murky. But no less interesting and exciting. After the appearance in the finals of a contented faces of Captain Barbossa and his faithful monkey phantom audience (I, anyway) and waited impatiently for the conclusion of this trilogy. A year later, we saw the conclusion ...'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' came out on Russian screens in May 2007 along with two other candidates in a record box office performance this season - namely, 'Shrek the Third' and 'Spider-Man: The enemy of reflection.' However, the creation Verbinski has left behind (but not so far) of their competitors. 'At World's End' - one of the most high-budget films in cinema history. The budget is nearly $ 300 million, most of which, apparently, went to the fees actors and special effects. Internationally, the picture has collected more than $ 900 million, so that Bruckheimer and co. with interest paid back on their expenses.The plot without distracting from the framework of the previous parts. In my opinion, that 'At World's End' is the best film of the entire trilogy. The script is great. So many plot lines, curves fit in pretty solid timekeeping (169 min.)! Totally unpredictable, but because the painting imparts more 'credibility', the ending is only good as the regular plans of Jack and Barbossa suggest a short extension ('Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides' is put into production under the auspices of the director's Rob Marshall, creator of Oscar-winning musical 'Chicago' and 'Memoirs of a Geisha'). Cinematography (Dariusz Wolski) and music (Hans Zimmer) is not satisfactory. Everything was done professionally and efficiently. Developed special effects studio Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), so too write about it (just look at the world famous 'Star Wars', 'Iron Man', 'Transformers' and the like blockbusters).The cast is really inspires his stardom. The main trio - is, of course, Depp, Bloom and Knightley. The first and the last kept a stiff upper lip, but Bloom, as in 'Dead Man's Chest,' disappoint. Not a very strong game. Also like Geoffrey Rush (Captain Barbossa), Tom Hollander (Cutler Beckett), Chow Yun-Fat (Xiao Feng), Bill Nighy (Davy Jones) and Naomie Harris (Tia Dalma / Calypso).In general we can write as much about this film and about the whole trilogy, but fact is fact: 'Pirates of the Caribbean' will forever in movie history, at least for the simple reason that this story was born thanks to a new unique image of Jack Sparrow.",10,0,1,30 January 2011
The Adventures of Tintin," Genuine warm feelings.
","In general, the production of 'Tintin' alludes to one simple truth: Be in love the fact that he takes over. If you can not - do not pull at all. After these excellent titles appear character. Then, second, third, and others. And together with them in the viewer's head slips inevitable thought that he watches the story where it extends everywhere terribly pleasant, warm feeling of reverent attitude. Spielberg and Jackson seemed to hold in his hands a miniature teddy Tintin, and say, 'my darling you, you are very dear to me, and I will remove your story worthy material.' Absolutely healthy sentimentalism outstanding people.Knowing, like any other spectator, Spielberg never imagined that he could be such a virtuoso. Prohibitive ease, despite the tremendous excess of saturation of the plot, and attention to all of its many parts in any of the episodes. As soon as the protagonist goes further and further into his investigation, Spielberg gradually more and more pressure on the gas pedal. One hundred and seven minutes to rapidly and consistently growing material, which completely faithful to the original source. Active adaptation to the original concept of the comic book is included in the first minutes, without showing any mercy to the audience confidently shooting his own power head.Without even the slightest hint at a weak point. Uniform attention to all stages of production shows itself in all its glory, when the taste and color work appears in every way as devoid of attacks, as well as differences. No one pulls the blanket over himself.Andy Serkis is high time to give that a Oscar, for such an outstanding job on their heroes in the mo-cap. Need more detail feel the subtleties of this technology in order to understand the extent to which the operator is masterpiece Janusz Kaminski as full a picture happy chaos, perhaps, even a child will notice. It's hard not to pay attention to scenes that are removed by a single plan, despite the fact that in one scene the hero of more than ten times the change in location of the local scale, and, incidentally, is not he alone. In other words, each more than five hundred times catch the question, 'well, that my friend, do not ever figure out how we managed to remove it?' This is primarily Spielberg stormed the adult audience. The all-new level of animation, which is achieved by getting rid of the known problems of motion capture technology of the past. A release is going brilliantly and simply, Spielberg holds the highest bar for directing a massive amount of detail frame. It should be noted that in the past that no one has yet succeeded.Not for nothing is actively publicized the names of the writers that are very well managed approach to adapting the source material. Originality extends to absolutely everything, every time changing its color, presented in the form of humor, in the form of interior parts, or separate dramatic characters, and so on. Perhaps somewhat lost because of his age cult composer John Williams. He manages to keep the bar full, but no more. If earlier it was possible to look over the projects he has worked to close my eyes and still feel full majesty only with your ears, here we can hardly see a similar picture. As a small minus someone may also take into account the lack of female characters, unless you count the fleeting appearance of a opera singer.'The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn' will amaze children of its history, and adults - an approach to it. An exciting and large-scale, original and fresh, colorful, funny and warm movie adventure, as a symbol of exquisite masterpiece of modern animation",10,1,5,6 November 2011
Tangled," Virgo-sun
","Great to watch the cartoon in the current horizon kinoepohu. Three magic studio every now and then lit it supernovae, and more - in an advanced 3D. Regiment wonderful cartoon this year has arrived - only manages to notice, as in the hearts of the audience lit up the stars 'The Frog Princess,' 'How to Train Your Dragon,' 'Shrek 4' and 'Toy Story 3.' As the curtain, the 'Walt Disney' presents us with an impeccable three-dimensional history of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale about Goldilocks - 'Rapunzel: complicated story.' And in this case are not talking about another sprocket computer animation, which lit up before our eyes: the emergence of 'Rapunzel' on this horizon - something like the sun.In tridevyatom kingdom, tridesyatom country lived a beautiful woman in high teremu ... This seems to be about her group 'Animation' sang that 'entangled in the fringe solar thread - Rapunzel braid length was more than twenty meters and all the glittering gold, worth a special girl to tighten the song.Rapunzel lifelong dream to know that the lights are lit on the horizon every year, right in the her birthday, but her stepmother forbade her to leave the tower. And you never know what would have ended the story Rapunzel, if only once, fleeing from the royal guard, in its tower is not got to a charming thief Flynn Ryder.And then ... twirled a story full of adventure, chase, artful wickedness, a girl blackmail robbers, romantic moments and beats frying pan! It is difficult to say anything critical about 'Rapunzel.' Not only is the pan, and a chameleon, ready shmyaknut wet tongue in his ear - so still and animated cartoon, this turned out almost perfect, right on the door by becoming real live classics.'Rapunzel' harmoniously combines the classic story of a princess and a knight, a bunch of most colorful secondary characters, excellent humor, touching romance and beauty of each frame.The truly chic in 'Disney has turned the main character - Goldilocks Rapunzel with huge green eyes, flexible pitched and crazy agility and variability. Since its first appearance in the frame of this charming miracle (even in the form of a sweet little girl) it is impossible not to fall in love. Rapunzel outdid everyone, absolutely everyone cartoons virgins not only long braids, but also for his incredible agility and naturalness. Watching this touching attractive face for a minute replaces a whole range of emotions, and all in all seriousness, it is impossible not to smile and do not carry the entire screen, forgetting about the existence of anything outside it.'The Prince' is also out for glory: restless charming hunk, hiding behind his own bravado tender heart. In general, psychological profiles are registered in 'Rapunzel' with a jeweler's precision: from the main characters - a gang of swashbuckling pirates to (each with a dream), including a sweetly-old man with a dandelion, depicting amurchika-angel.This gang is not just for the cartoon will make the soul pohohotat over their antics. But even more magically humorous moments provides a couple of minor characters: the horse, sniffer, persistently followed Flynn Ryder and militancy of a chameleon - home zverushka Rapunzel.Had not heard Rapunzel singing in the original, but voiced cartoon to fame: the main characters voice says Victoria Daineko and Gregory Antipenko and, more importantly, the songs they performed well. Turned melodic and piercing - is cinema songs Rapunzel and Flynn's hardly worth listening to, but in the scene, they sound very organic.'Rapunzel' combines a lot of topics - is full of cartoon and humor, and original brick-busting action - but intelligible only tells of the love. Romance out there - like watching 'Titanic' for the first time, as a catharsis - a scene of incredible beauty, when the sky lifted hundreds of paper lanterns ... Breath catches in delight and touching fragility of this moment, and as the sun touches the heart.And if you have not touched this Sunbeam - do not miss by far the best cartoon of the year. 'Rapunzel' - this is the fairy-tale magic of cinema in a concentrated form, and Disney once again is right: now I see the light ...",10,5,8,28 November 2010
Captain America: The First Avenger," The First Avenger
","A spectacular comic-book adventure movie that features a muscular, red blooded, all-American hero, Steve Rogers a.k.a. Captain America, he is brilliantly played by Chris Evans who is so perfectly casted in the role, he captures the character's earnestness and humility, as well as his old-fashioned gung ho spirit and patriotism. Joe Johnson's direction is right on target, and he gives us a truly exciting and meticulously crafted motion picture, the story is set in 1942 where a short, skinny, asthmatic 98-pound weakling from Brooklyn, named Steve Rogers has tried to enlist to fight in 'World War II, but has been rejected numerous, unlike his best friend 'Bucky Barnes, nicely played by Sabastian Stan who has been shipping off to the battlefields in Europe.

Hugo," About the movie magic
","The film was concerned more with the first news. Still, the family of Martin Scorsese's film - it's a little unusual, but it is tempting - especially with such actors. In the end, 'Keeper of Time' does not confirm the fears and exceeds all expectations - with Scorsese got something that does not always work out in the cinema itself, not to mention the individual directors. In front of us - Magic straight from childhood, and it does not matter when it was his childhood - you feel it, not as a modest retrospective. But in order ...Directed by Martin Scorsese in fact - a living classic of cinema, without which it is difficult to imagine the genre of crime films, besides, he was always very talented stylist, and his films were full of very interesting mounting solutions. Does he use this experience in 'Keepers of Time'? Yes, but very selectively. It is encouraging that being on unfamiliar territory, Martin Scorsese did not cling to what he knew numbers and techniques. 'Keeper ...' looks fresh and at the same time, so it seems that love this movie for a long time. Directed exactly what is honest with his audience, it does not work on some kind of target audience: the film is not lisp, but we do not like regular dark realism, a favorite in modern cinema.And the movie itself - it's a film about magic movie, which is now made to bury under the gloomy scenarios and effects tones. Yes, in the 'Guardian ...' is not so simple. The protagonist - Hugo Cabra (young, but very entertaining Asa Butterfield) lost his father and forced to live at the train station, watching the clock, and around him, at first glance, it is not friendly people in more accidents and broken - the same as Toys, which sells old magician (Sir Kingsley ene) or leg cruel, but a lone inspector (mustached Sacha Baron Cohen) ... all - like broken clockwork, which never have enough gear, so that they could go further. Thus, the magician will be a real magician - though from the world of cinema, just stopped believing in magic, and evil is not evil inspector, just such a life.The characters here are classic and the film does without surprises. But as he presents them - through the whole picture is not so much a story of growing up, but simply finding yourself. Asa Butterfield played as such can only play so children - clean and quite technical, but with talent. Chloe Moretz, the young, but the star, it looks much more natural than in the same 'Let me in' or 'Piptse.' Sound terribly old-fashioned role of a girl who dreams of adventure, Chloe looked better than in the roles of girls coming off limbs for people. It was nice to see the big actors - such as Kingsley (as very important for the movie rights), or Christopher Lee. Living legends, they are people usual, but with tremendous spark. Ben Kingsley has turned terribly vulnerable, and bereguschim themselves from large shocks - unlike his other books. Christopher Lee plays the one his monumental charisma, singing - only then - the owner of a bookshop. Sacha Baron Cohen has shown himself not as a chief mocker and troll movie, but as an actor. Yes, its inspector - is a collective image of the employees of all law enforcement agencies, and the stage with delivery of orphans and Doberman explicitly mocked the Nazis, but throughout the film are left covered by this story, these characters do not notice a dirty trick. Especially as Cohen demonstrates really cool game - not only funny but also touching. As for Jude Law and Ray Winston, they are treacherous enough. But Lowe's is charming and sweet as his father Hugo and Winston is the image of the watchmaker-drinkers.In fact, Scorsese filmed a movie about all - and of themselves, and many of the spectators, even the very young. In a world of endless sequels, gloomy and serious restarts no longer believe in the magic of cinema, which it had once granted the. It is significant that the director in whose films reflect the worst vices of men, took the wise but not preachy film. Even in the most vivid and dramatic moments 'Hraniel time' is kept straight with his audience. He does not need to surprise the beauty of these Paris 30s (and they are great!) Or lecture. After all, a movie - it's magic, which is sometimes not necessary to have a double bottom, and let it remain a focus, but it gives people pleasure. In this respect, 'The Guardian of Time' - Cinema with a capital letter, not intended for a specific age or age group. The film is beautiful inside and outside of his ideas - a panorama of Paris and the railway station were worth every dollar 170,000,000th budget, and embodied it with great talent and surprisingly gently, carefully.Best story of the year! I am glad that the movie recently lifted from the abyss mrachnyaka - Project Master 'Super 8', 'The Adventures of Tintin' and now 'Guardian of time' once again make Cinema what he must be - a place where dreams are happening!P.S. Could not find the place to describe Howard Shore soundtrack. Well you can not make the entire tip of the words 'magic' and 'great'! Music turned out to Shore atypical - all very gently and easily, with a great deal of French sounds. In the movie sound track Camille St-Seyesa and Erik Satie - Howard Shore is clearly inspired by the works of these classics ...",9,3,6,5 January 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Rise of the Planet of the Apes
","This is essentially a B movie dressed up with an expensive production budget and an A-list cast. The events are simplistic and predictable, with nary a plot twist in the entire 105 minutes. Don't get me wrong, in spite of the predictability, the movie is still entertaining as all get out. As the action unfolds we clearly witness a detailed evolution that leads to a climatic battle. The buildup is beautifully done. The machinations are far fetched, but the intellectual advances of the chimps are presented in a most credible fashion. Not only will you accept a chimp could acquire super intelligence, but you'll cheer their ascension to power.The tale's allure is thanks in no small part to the principal chimpanzee's emotionally engaging portrayal. Dispensing with makeup applied to human actors that has been the method in past installments, this reboot relies on major strides in computer technology to create the simian characters. The star chimpanzee, Caesar, is a brilliant use of CGI created from a motion-capture performance by Andy Serkis. Renowned as Gollum from The Lord of the Rings trilogy, he's crucial to the enjoyment of this science fiction. I'd actually go as far to say the full picture's success rests with him. It's a wonderfully expressive depiction. Caesar has an emotional progression that is comprehensive. A revolt becomes logical because his emotional trajectory is so believable. We truly mind what happens to this central figure since we're emotionally invested in his growth. Even a simple scene where he corrects the way Will's father holds a fork, is remarkably poignant.",8,4,9,6 August 2011
Cars 2," James Bond & Johnny English
","That these two names can be characterized by the greatest super agent 80% of the film. Naturally Bond - is a real agent Fin MakMintl and unusual Inglish - a tow truck Maitre. It is usually assumed that the sequel - a rather bitter word, since they are unsuccessful, try to go to the past glory of parts, and just a quickie. I can not say the same about this cartoon, but still the first part was better. And the main character this time is not lightning, apparently by his friend liked the writers, because even a single cartoon about it is.In the wheelbarrow was morality, and so bright, not worn out. Here you have a lot in recent years have seen films about the choice between wealth, fame, recognition, and real, genuine friendship? Personally, I am not one. Well, continued - it is the purest spy thriller, only slightly seasoned friendship of the main characters, and thoughts about the destination. Although it's too bad, the summer after all.Interesting question, I came almost immediately after the start of the session. Lightning McQueen took command of the first part of the finals for only one race? Now it has different mechanics or just dub is not quite correct? And yes, sad news for fans of Doc Hudson, undefeated, it will not. Why, you will learn in the first five minutes of the film. To be honest, I was hoping to continue to see plenty of racing, as in the first part I did not have them, and 'lucky' they are really more. On the whole one. Well, what do you want from the spy thriller? Secret spy gadgets, shooting, car chases, explosions and even murder. But not racing. I even remember Rush Hour (tour of Japan), and the film Johnny Inglish (almost all of the master, including the final). Incidentally, in the cinema around me (and many before me, and after, both the left and right) were children of kindergarten age 5-6. And they did not like. Not a children's cartoon apparently unsuccessful, although a lot of funny moments.The quality of pictures can say a lot, but why? After all, it's Pixar and Disney, they are always on top. The scenario is not taken out, but the picture is simply amazing. Soundtrack matched perfectly. It is mainly noticeable in the scenes of battles and races, which is quite natural and logical. But it also happens in quiet moments, the music makes the astonishing skill of composers.As a result, for an incredible picture, sparkling humor, spy gadgets and a good soundtrack put a solid seven.ps: in the credits is a special thanks to Steve Jobs, I wonder what he did?",7,4,8,25 June 2011
Puss in Boots," The greatest hero
","Remember the good children's tale about the cat and its owner Marquis Carabas? Well, this cartoon is not about him, and the brutal and insidious killer of giants from Shrek - Cote boots. But that is if he really and what is hiding behind his cute attractive face? That's what we decided to tell Dreamworks. By the way, strange enough, but kids in the hall almost was not, basically a couple (well, this is understandable, even seals on YouTube are popular.)The script tells us about the past of the hero, including a mini-story of the Cat, about his childhood. But the bulk of the followers of Jack's adventure takes the bean stalk and hunt for golden eggs. Of course, many changes, but it is a modern cartoon fairy tales treatment now in vogue. There are two main story lines: friendship and love. To be honest, both are shown in this way that children will hardly interesting morality, are not mature enough yet to treachery and romance. But the jokes, dances and other frills - just for them. Shrek style is preserved, 'his wife flowers, ice cream ditYam', well, or a great moral uncle and aunt, and children - humor. Both lines are disclosed in some detail, especially friendship. Then you and flashbacks of the meeting, and this association, and of course fix the bad guys. And love - is all the chances to continue, maybe we'll see him someday.The picture is even interesting. I really do not like 3d, but would not say that it was a lot, but overall not bad. And the scenery, 'wild west', and urban slums, and even cloud castle - all beyond praise. The soundtrack, like in Shrek, does the job. Where should he play fonchikom where you want to highlight key, and even during the dance, listen to it - a pleasure.Side of humor, as I said, at the level of Shrek. There are jokes for both children and adults have. In recent years, taken to introduce any exotic character that will appear periodically in the background, and to publish funny sounds, comment, or ape. Here he became a cat out of the bar, with its 'Uooou.' I do not quite understand why the place of the partner chose the egg, though of course it is logical in relation to the golden eggs, but they could not bother and we are so deep, sometimes just annoying.Overall, this movie I would suggest to look in love (in the end, many in the room kissing), it is natural to children, and indeed all relax does not interfere. Easy, not too deep a cartoon, of course, with a happy-end, which will teach you how to take care of Lady, and to seek adventure on his butt.",9,6,13,29 October 2011
Super 8," extraterrestrial
","Abrams film in uniform doses, combines the story of teenage first love and growing up with a monster-movie about how the train ran out of the container creepy and dangerous alien. Originally a completely different subjects, they finally successfully intertwined in an interesting and eventful script. The action takes place in the late seventies, where a group of kids writes a movie about zombies. Particularly curious viewers can wait until the end credits, when they finished work will be shown in full. Meanwhile, the above mentioned alien escapes from a train caught in a catastrophe, and now in a small town lost dogs, people, different things, and electronic devices, and a large group of soldiers occupied the territory under its control.Meticulously closing the frame escaped monster movie sincerely hopes to keep the suspense until the very end, and there is not quickly hurry to demonstrate solid plans for the creation in all its glory, regularly turning away, with a focus on individual limbs, and only occasionally allowing the establishment to consider. Agree whether a patient viewer on so many expectations - still a big issue, but apart from an escaped alien monster movie has something to please.Teenage story told in the context of events, regularly crawls to the front, but it is not eclipsed investigation to find and capture the monster in chrede associated mysterious events. Nevertheless, the babies are handled with their roles in the cast is not difficult uglyadet hints now known directors, but this whole men's team easily beats the gorgeous Elle Fanning, presenting the most colorful character with the most expressive expression. Still would not fall in love in such a protagonist, but that's only between their families turned Shakespeare's passion and mutual hatred, so that the new version of Romeo and Juliet has run off in secret to each other at night. And if a boy came out of a whole accommodating and creative, the Alley presents the heroine, a rebel, even able to steal a car.Adults same characters barely able to attract attention, nondescript military captain and a handful of parents have stood out so much boring and banal in its behavior, which can hardly somehow manifest themselves on the screen, but absolutely template framework papashka unsociable and cold-blooded warriors. In fact more of them and is not required, first be gradually transformed into a near and dear son of man, well deserved second punished for inhumanity, this picture Abrams copes, playing lifeless characters on static relationships.But the closer to the finale, the lost notes of romance and relationships in the young heroes. Replacing a potential first kiss scene in a terrible episode with a slap, completing a very cool meeting with the parents of a tiny touch of your fingers between the main characters, and all further retreat by intrigues, adventures of monsters, and things happening around the military action of the emotions and feelings, as if Abrams is aware that his characters may be too small for a serious love story, and started for the health of an interesting story, he immediately turns her into an instant, reborn in the romance of friendship, and the story of teenagers in a standoff outside threat.Yes, and the monster looks ten times worse than Cloverfield in appearance, though several times shorter. The creature stood out so terrible, dangerous and mnogorukoy that doubt, even in the presence of at least some intelligence in the head with a similar palate. Terrible creation is deservedly expose the threat to life, the desperate rush to justify violent actions and motives, and this duality is really not the best way affects the perception of the film.For a fair share of stones in the garden of the military, and those without pity and little animals inoculated from space are shown in the impartial light, as a much greater evil to the civilian population than the disorderly establishment escaped. And to complement this painting experiments and the cruelty of the visitor from other planets have been superfluous. But the deployed military force with a bunch of explosions and special effects completely delight in the final picture, yet the military is not for nothing in such abundance are presented in the plot. However, no final flight of the spacecraft, or destruction of military equipment, it is not as spectacular as equal to the initial crash of the train, which is only deserved admiration and applause! Concealing a regular appearance of wandering stranger, the film is not seldom creates a fair amount of tension and even the experience of some of the characters. The mystery plays here and there in favor of the circumstances, I wish only that the answer to all questions are not in a hurry, tying all of just too monotonous scene-teasers. The fact that at first aroused interest, gradually tiring, and even seemed to be extremely tense scene in the bus upside down, instead of the proper emotion is only an analogy with the much more terrible scenes of 'Jeepers Creepers 2.' Nostalgic, in many countries and quite smooth in structure to the 'Super 8' attracts, despite its drawbacks, how serious would they have been. Picture deserves attention and looks with interest, though not in the same breath, with a fair amount of boredom and spots inhibiting the development of the plot scenes, but still leaving behind good memories and pleasant aftertaste. Abrams creation of producer Steven Spielberg came out just a good film, albeit without enthusiasm and willingness to reconsider, but the best choice for family viewing. Leaving a pleasant experience and earning interest of the audience, a film about an alien and the company of children is clearly worth a look.",7,1,4,18 June 2011
Inception," Inception
","Now that's something like it! Even I will not consider how many years any more was a film holding attention even in a condition not absolutely incubate all of 155 minutes. Surprising rhythm, reducing and raising pressure there where it is necessary. Perfectly well picked up actor's structure - everyone plays the hero. A second more than it is possible for sugariness. Direction - who there that about decline of the American cinema spoke??? Magnificent. Was стрёмно that just about will begin muffled not good, but is not present! All wisely, but is clear even to me - far not to the sharpest spectator on this planet!) excellent cinema! The strongest history. Absolute observance of dramaturgic laws.

Rango," A lizard with a big heart!
","<ul><li>A good script always starts with a very dull moment, is not it? © I, like probably many other people, 'Rango' interested in a very long time - not his looks strange lizards, and Johnny Depp, who was her voice, and the inscription on the placard: 'From the creators of' Pirates of the Caribbean. 'If who 'Pirates' and does not like, it's likely, for any not be able to say that the film was unprofessional. I was not prepared for what cartoon I do not like, but I was not sure of the return. Actually, I happy! Quite by accident and suddenly he is standing alone on the road. And it is not a fad. It just happened. Actor, he wore a red shirt and was pretty confident. But in the desert, where he was, there was no hope. Yes, and how to tackle it, if there is not even water! Handsome Rango was able to prove the first minutes of all the residents that he is a hero. And even became sheriff. With this and the adventures begin, full of laughter and imagination.</li></ul>Struck by the fact that there was a sense of presence - as if the journalists were reporting from the scene. For this I must say thank you to artists - an incredible atmosphere, hot and tart, was transferred perfectly. Each movement has been perfected and very clear, that was been noted many details, also played into the hands. Huge cactus - like Arizona, an orange umbrella, falling into a glass, a drop of water - and only seems to last; clockwork fish, palm curve and Gita beside her.Rango itself reminded me of Jack Sparrow - its charming gait and bizarre run - legs in different directions ', well, his awkward dance so all he brought me into raptures. Cartoon turned bright and memorable, and most importantly - funny! Stunning western! Theme music was also very good as the very statement - very original. The ending was struck - not the very essence, and those in which shell that are wrapped. There is no need to analyze the game actors, so we can only say that 'Rango' - Cartoon about the meaning of life and water, the bright representative of the adventure genre, where there are tears and laughter, weird lizards and wild birds, the voice of Johnny Depp's voice is mixed with Isla Fisher. Stunning animation, very strong, worthy, who many will remember forever! Watch worth it!",10,1,4,19 March 2011
X-Men: First Class," Man by nature is being tuned to a whole new categorical.
","In fact, the fact that the highest ratings of the movie titles with 'X-Men' can not inspire the viewer, whose goal in going to the movies - a bucket of popcorn, cold 'Cola' and lots of positive emotions directly from the spectacle, which he expects to receive . At the same time there were fears that the movie can be a tedious and cloying, especially after the promises made by Matthew Vaughn from the movie to make complicated mix of youth melodrama, like 'Twilight,' and other things, that so typical of the summer blockbuster. However, all expectations after the scene display their talents Eric were some dull, useless, because the movie - it's not just action and melodrama, it is also an element of culture, an element that can, if desired to embody anything.Rant on the topic of how good the story was not worth it, because he's really good, but no more. It has some inconsistencies and small plot 'appendixes, but they do not do anything wrong the general concept for how to write off all at the expense of' the starting point 'and the fact that this film adaptation of comic books, comic books, moreover, is not the most famous Russian public, it turns pretty easy. No, nothing delusional and objectively excess is not observed, but difficult to call all of these plot moves riding genius. The script just fine. More precisely, even so: is simple, because even good.Everything goes through some sort of unwritten plan, as usual, and I must say, very confidently. Sometimes even a thought that, come this tape years ago, eleven commercials, will it be now, if not universally accepted classics of the genre, or at least included in the list of his rules.In 'First Class' There is nothing flowery and, often, fills all the empty space. All lines are the heroes have a logical ending, and perhaps that's why nice to watch all this action. Yes, of course, who would be there that may say, but the pathos is also present, but, in fact, it strongly enough in comparison with many similar bands, and when it is, the characters seem even heartier, perhaps, may have even some on-screen life is waking up.All this, of course, is not very easy and very pleasant to an eye a couple of James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. Their duet looks as organically and naturally, because guys are not devoid of distinctive features and play their characters with great devotion, that neither can not affect the overall level of acting. Just a little surprised by the ease McAvoy, but this is the surplus of the image, not otherwise. Fassbender is, in fact, magnificent, and I say this almost without exaggeration. His image is powerful, hot, passionate and extremely interesting artistically.Mummery excellent main characters and a good story canvas strengthened and that the action as the main driving element of most summer blockbusters, which, incidentally, 'X-Men' could be considered with interest, looks almost the most minor details of the painting. Yes, everything is done at the highest level and the director of most scenes you can put a solid 'five', but 'First Class' is surprisingly skillfully won it on the feelings of the characters, not how beautiful or, conversely, they are operating their awful abilities.In general, turned abruptly on all sides. Tape is without doubt a good and attractive, but in this case, probably all. It seeks not to be supersereznoy and raise topics that she does not pick up on the forces, and this is its main advantage. 'First Class' - a reference sample of summer blockbuster, which must appeal to many. It's simple and delicious. In the film, there is nothing complicated and abstruse, and the curse for this Matthew Vaughn makes no sense. Bright, interesting, funny and very, very pleased to see the old-new characters in the new-old guise. Only Logan is not changed.",10,6,11,4 June 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," The winner is the quality of beliefs, not their quality kolichestvo.Pobezhdaet convictions, not their quantity.
","Frankly it's sad, and at the same time happy. I simply do not belong to those who have always responded with a special enthusiasm for any of the movie franchise about a young wizard. However, I am glad that we always had to consciously approach the fact of its existence. Much has happened over the years. For some of us have been ups and downs in relation to the part of Harry Potter, for someone not. We are alone. Such stories - only a sign of how this loneliness we are trying to escape. When there is that it is able to unite us, and the same eyes we are able to watch the same story. Harry and his friends always reminded very much of themselves, because of two things - simplicity and good nature. Also, like any other person, we grow, mature, and it all happens under the influence of other factors. We observe and listen, exactly the same as the one when a little boy, in the course of years became a man. He had fears, and there were mysteries. He sought to solve them, and overcome all sorts of difficulties. He was tough, and friends were always glad to help. Is this not a reflection of our life in certain stages of her? Istoriya3D finally reached the tipping point that, when there was absolutely no childhood, and adulthood appeared views of the surrounding events. No more compromises, and as it turned out, it had to Yates to clear better film3D Potteriana.Finals begin at the same place and finished last. Harry continues to search and destroy krestrazhem, revealing a truth long after the other. Each of the stories of how wonderful flower blooms on the quality of its on-screen incarnation, and this against the background of the war, that this time reached the very heart of the School of Wizardry - Hogwarts. So we have not seen it, and now never see. For many viewers Hogwarts was a kind of contact point values, which were always presented in the form of friendship and nastoyatelstva. And no more delays, no unnecessary chatter. Only Harry, only fidelity, and pursuing all the destruction. You can refer yourself to whichever of the categories of viewers, but the fact remains a fact for all - 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2' is the perfect combination of language and the magic of cinema, so perfect a form of which is sought or one year.Yates throws us into an even more oppressive and heavy atmosphere with all the consequent seriousness from the first seconds. Conversation with Kryukohvatom each evokes the idea of ​​just how significant was the approach to creating images of goblins, only gaining full speed as soon as we find ourselves in a bank vault. Excellent work on the sound makes itself felt, balancing between the absolute silence, drama and suspense.Yet in one part of the franchise was not represented in such a grand magic number, as here. If someone had thought of her lack of a rare and often repeated occurrence, there is an argument not able to find a way for his being. Scenes from the attack on the school and a further battle in its territory amazing imagination, especially by the scope with which this material came to the creators. Protection of Hogwarts gorgeous scenes extras are told by their size, and many characters appear in a surprisingly strong and significant way.The entire color stunning British school of acting punches for most of the scenes, making us even more insight to treat them. Finally, the record screen time was Ralph Fiennes, whose 'you know who' the destruction of each of the next Horcrux is even more direct correspondence notions of darkness and gloom. Neville takes off from their shoulders image of a modest and humble guy, and gives your episodes live energy of goodness and faith. Home trio strongly demonstrates a complete renunciation of those pranks that are brought before us in various amounts for previous years. Romantic issues are themselves short, direct and confident answers. This is not the children we once knew. Now it's two guys, behind which the power and courage, and a real woman, able to charm anyone looking right at it man. However, I think, a hero of the imagery comes to Severus. It is starting to deploy its history, it's not just Harry. It is not just the bar, which surely holds Yates first hour and a half. It is much more than that.Severus makes history more than ever to penetrate the gap and in the emotional space in which Alan Rickman is calling us. Beginning to emerge as answers to many protracted and complex issues. What happens immediately taking shape full epics, which is so easily dissolved, knowing how long we were going to this. And the last conversation with Harry Dambusom only emphasizes the last time that a tipping point, when the whole world that was built many years around one person starts to go away from under his feet. Saying goodbye to them, leaving alone with the problem itself throughout his life that he so carefully prepared.In the finals can be found inconsistencies with the book, but their role does not affect the plot by a radical way, and all the changes made by Yeats, were personally approved by Rowling. Staged ending only emphasizes the importance and drama of the whole junction, causing the heroes to face any one time with each other. Two opposing world, the best colors and shades, with unique emotional content and the history of origins.Just supporting each other we are capable of much. Unsurpassed finale unmatched history.Goodbye, Harry.",10,30,67,10 July 2011
Sin City," It's worth it ...
","'Sin City' - is not just a movie. This is a new word in the history of cinema.What immediately strikes the eye is the style of the film. Black and white background, the dynamics of light and shadow, color accents - all this holds a high level and it looks indescribably beautiful.Robert Rodriguez - a truly talented director when it comes to action, but his camera work in this film is beyond praise. Quentin Tarantino took just one scene, but that it is one of the most memorable in the film.Now the details of the episodes: Customer is always right. Josh Hartnett coped well with the role of cold-blooded killer, first in his actions do not even hint at what he's going to do. This is the opening scene begins with it 'Sin City' How easy to say goodbye. Most brutal and cynical part of the film. It tells us about the hideous bandit, whose girlfriend was killed and now he is on track to take revenge. Mickey Rourke in the role of Marva is incomparable, his character is almost not kill, both physically and spiritually.To kill - so to kill. The history of urban cowboy, who stood up to protect friends and unwittingly gets involved in a war between the police and the inhabitant of 'Old Town'. Clive Owen is resolute and prudent, the heroine of Rosario Dawson just a bomb, and the charming Miho played by Devon Aoki enduring audience.Yellow bastard. My favorite episode. It tells of an honest cop who brutally framed and accused of crimes he did not commit. But he was ready to put up with it because all he does for her ... Tiny Nancy Callahan, age 11. Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba - the most vivid presonazhi episode, and the entire picture as a whole.Outcome. The film is perfect, beautiful and unique.",10,2,3,7 February 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Adrenaline
","On the screen appeared a long-awaited sequel to one of the world's most popular kinofranshiz - grand battle with robots and many more huge extraterrestrial organisms are closely intertwined in the new film by Michael Bay 'Transformers: The Dark Side of the Moon.' This project has experienced a lot, making his way to the screens through a long and thorny path of very large troubles, at least remember the conflict Megan Fox and Mr. Beem, in which she left the project or the protests of one of the most commercially successful directors against converting the picture in 3D, which As already noticeable among U.S. television viewers have already begun to lose popularity. But the long and arduous wait viewers and fans of robots come true - now at last it was time to see one of the most ambitious projects of the year, if not - the most ambitious.After the critics pretty well received the first part of the franchise, and then smashed to pieces a sequel (which turned into a very rich harvest 'Razzie'), Michael Bay has promised that trikvel get better. And now, seeing the creation of new director ya3D can confidently say - Mr. Bay entirely kept his promise. The main advantage here is a very good and coherent script written by Ehren Kruger, this time alone - without colleagues to create the second part of Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci. Now the script, as compared with the second film, refined almost to the smallest detail, there are no inconsistencies and gaps. It becomes evident that received 'Golden Raspberry' for the script to 'Revenge of the Fallen' Ehren Kruger rehabilitated.As a result, the script came from a terrific story, perhaps the most dramatic and tense, compared with the previous parts. The third part of the history of robots almost completely riddled with treachery, which enhances the drama.On changes in the cast will not talk much - because of the well-known conflict with Megan Fox, director of the film took place girls photomodel Sam Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, igra3D which was the debut in the film. Of course, I, like many, leaving Megan caused disappointment, but began an acting career looked great fashion model. Only wish Miss Huntington-Whiteley successful career in kino3D.What about the other actors. The film played beautifully Shia LaBeouf, Tyrese Gibson, Josh Duhamel and John Turturro, who played roles in the film with great enthusiasm. Also noteworthy is a good game and Patrick Dempsey, Kevin Dunne, who appeared in the film with a very respectable beard.Film3D also boasts stunning visual effects, excellent operator and a very high quality soundtrack. Feel free to say that the special effects in the third part of the most powerful and spectacular than the previous two films. Thanks to them, in great detail and look spectacular giant Decepticons (for example, Shokueyv) and the Autobots.By carrier-art Amir M. Wet is as good as the work of two previous statements in the 'Transformers' - Mitchell Amundsen and Ben Seresinu. Some were even taken priemy3D powerful. A longtime composer Steve Jablonsky offered to the audience (not the first time), another stunning soundtrack. With music by the previous parts were quite a few in common, all the tracks are new and sounds great. In places the music is smooth and quiet, but mostly exciting and almost making their way to the bone.Also, the film contains a lot of humor, which is mainly small roll in the Autobots and quite a few characters. Quite comical watching some of the characters (Dutch, for example). Is enough funny scenes, it is worth recalling at least the scene in the bathroom with Sam and Jerry (Ken Jeong).'Transformers 3: The Dark Side of the Moon' - an incredible and breathtaking spectacle, captivating fiction thriller with a very good drama as well as a humorous element. Very bright, dynamic action, which claims to be one of the most exciting blockbusters of the summer season.

V for Vendetta," The power of truth, even during his lifetime, I won the universe.

Wachowski brothers still know their job perfectly well. Why are only special effects, explosions and Old Parliament Bailey surprised by its beauty and craftsmanship.Word of honor to know him at once, in his real voice. Then only in the closing credits confirmed that I was not mistaken. Now imagine anyone else in the role of V can not. Even if not seen his appearance as such. Porcelain mask was his face, in every sense. In the course of the film, she comes alive in my eyes, I'm glad that never showed face Hugo.Think of a dialogue with Ivy Wee, after he released her from prison, my heart nearly stopped, to tears was a moment. An excellent game that deserves every possible award once. Although Smith was good, but it plays V in all respects.'Beneath this mask is more than flesh, beneath this mask idea, and ideas can not die'The result of my admiration will mention scenes out Bu on fire, and Ivy in the rain.
