The Blair Witch Project," You've got to be kidding........
",Absolutely the worst piece of trash filmmaking ever created. These 3 jokers are laughing all the way to bank knowing they have ripped off the world with their very artistic and extremely horrible junk. Simply not scary even for one second not one single bit. Not worth the time the effort or the admission price. I could go on all day about how this movie sucks but I wont waste any more of my time.,1,8,14,29 October 2001
The Last Samurai," Excellent
","Excellent photography, excellent music, excellent sets, excellent action, excellent costumes, excellent movie.Some people have said the ending was weak and hollywood-ish. I dont think its that bad but it does seem like the last scenes were torn on which way to go just like Japan was in the story.****",9,0,0,14 December 2003
Signs," Suspenseful - would have been without Special Effects
",I thought this movie was about a family spooked by crop circles and possible hint of Extra-Terrestrials. Wow was I surprised when the aliens started walking around and breaking into peoples houses.Very suspenseful. Great job of portraying a family coping with fear and death.But could have still done all that and been a great or better film without the special effects. I think it could have been done subtly like just hinting that ut was real aliens and giving the audience a choice to decide what to believe was happening in the end.Anyway great movie overall. But crop circles can be done by a couple of drunk guys with boards and ropes - but does that mean that all of them were pranks.......???You Decide !,Null,0,1,25 August 2002
The Island," Wow! oh wait I meant woh...
",Standard summer action flick. Intriguing story. Great action. Many plot holes and inconsistencies. Neither main character would have survived each of the 2 falls off the building. And what a totally lame love scene. And how did top ex-commando security let an armed girl back into the facility ??? And just where was the hospital that perspective clients were visiting? - no parking lot for those guests either... Sure maybe Ewan needed some action after playing old fogie Obi-Wan but after the latest string of Oscar and Golden Globe nominated performances why did Scarlett bow to do this fluff ??? Another great character actor goes for the paycheck over the plot I guess. And they could have made some cool cars for the movie instead of using last years concept cars right off the autoshow stage. It was a wild ride but it still a standard summer movie and unfortunately very forgettable. Roeper was right this plays like 2 completely different movies. They should have concentrated on one of them and made it better. Yes Scarlett Johansson is a babe but also a wonderful actress and deserves much better than this movie.,6,1,2,29 July 2005
