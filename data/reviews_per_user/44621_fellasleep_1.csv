The Ring," creepy
","well i never saw the original japanese one so i cant really judge how good of a remake this was but i was really freaked out throughout this movie.
its not gory and its not exactly monsters that jump out and say 'boo' that scare you... you just see a bunch of creepy strange images that stick with you for awhile. and although the story itself is pretty weird and the end is kinda lame, this is the scariest you can get for a PG-13 ...and try not to scream every two seconds.",Null,0,0,30 December 2002
