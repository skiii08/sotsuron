Minority Report," Absolute garbage. Don't believe the hype.
",i've just got back from seeing this film and I have to say it's the most pretentious rubbish since the last Tom Cruise film (Vanilla Sky). I left early because I didn't have the slightest idea what was going on & more to the point I didn't care. Special effects? So what? Complete head up the backside tripe. I'm sure it will win loads of Oscars but so did Gladiator. 1/10 - nonsense.,1,4,8,9 July 2002
