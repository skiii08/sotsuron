Ghost," excellent love story with a strong character arc
","Sam (Patrick Swayze) unable to truly express his deep love for his lover while alive, demonstrates his love and devotion to her in his afterlife as a consequence of avenging his murder and bringing those guilty of it to justice.Patrick Swayze does a remarkable job of playing Sam, an uncertain, pessimistic character in his human life, who dies and through trial and tribulations in his afterlife protects his lover from evil and brings about personal justice. In the process of bringing this about, Sam defines his love in a way he was unable to do in his living life. The screenplay's strong character arc (from a weak character to a strong hero) gets the viewer deeply involved in the first person and ends in a way that more than satisfies expectation.",Null,1,2,30 October 2005
Kung Fu Panda," All the Elements of a Children's Story
","I enjoy reading children's stories because no matter what the country of origin, they all universally speak for the weaknesses and tendencies of man. Kung Fu Panda, despite not being derived from a classic children's story, has all the elements that teach and prepare children for what to expect from the cynical, imperfect world of adults.Po is a panda serving as apprentice in his father's noodle shop. Despite being obese and awkward, his dream is to become a Kung Fu great one day. The day of reckoning comes when Master Oogway, a wise tortoise and Kung Fu master, recognizes Po as the 'chosen' one to battle evil. Po is dispatched immediately to the 'Shaolin' like training monastery.Po isn't well received by his trainer Shifu and by his highly skilled classmates: the tiger, the preying mantis, the monkey, the snake, and the crane. All are jealous, disappointed and insulted that an unproven novice would overshadow their renowned reputation. Many times our cynical needs to rise in importance will cause us to destroy those destined to save us. In the end, all five and Shifu get their crack at battling evil, the snow leopard Tai Lung. They all fail. Po, the dark horse, finally comes through to save the day. All are now happy in the Valley of Peace. All is forgiven.Kung Fu Panda is a cartoon metaphor to describe the traditional brick and mortar workplaces in America. 'New blood' is often at odds with the senior workforces who see new approaches and ideas as a beachhead for an eventual overhaul of the status quo.",10,0,0,7 June 2010
The Hunger Games," A movie reminiscence of mankind's dark history
","Eerie reminiscence of the mankind's dark, psychopathic past (the Greek Minotaur, the roman's gladiators and the island of Capri, and most recently the drafting of youths into the Vietnam conflict) this movie takes place in the future where society pits male and female youths (a total of 24) selected from 12 districts against one another in a compelling, lethal cocktail of hide and seek, and musical chairs. This movie, like 1984, reflects man's insecurities whereby in the future, he gave up his power and control to the state in exchange for a state managed society. Subconsciously, this movie particularly strikes home to the males of the Vietnam generation who were selected to enter the war games in the jungles of Vietnam when they came of age (and later when it became a lottery system) much like the characters in the movie. And like in the movie, much of the battles in that war were filmed and televised.",9,4,6,3 June 2016
Full Metal Jacket," Stanley Kubrick's genius comes through
","It is said that 90% of directing is casting. That is just part of Kubrick's genius. Another part of his genius is for capturing the right setting and ambiance. This movie has two part: first half is the boot camp drama with R. Lee Ermey (Sgt Hartman), the marine drill instructor, Matthew Modine (Prvt J.T. 'Joker' Davis) as the intelligent, aspiring combat reporter, and Vincent D'Onofrino (Prvt Leonard 'Gomer Pyle' Leonard) as the overweight, whipping boy of Sgt Hartman. The drama revolves around Pyle, as Sgt Hartman finds pleasure in belittling his screw ups in front of the others. Joker is paired up with Pyle to be his teacher and mentor. This part of the movie describes the dehumanization process a marine endures in basic training as preparation for them to be fashioned into a weapon of war. The second part is the recruits in the battle field. Joker's assignment as a reporter allows him to view the war experience from an audience's point-of- view. Eventually Pyle tags along with Prvt Cowboy's unit (a fellow recruit) as they patrol the ruins of the city of Hue following an attack known as the Tet Offensive. Towards the climax, 2 of Cowboy's men get picked off by an unknown sniper. This represents the hidden death that lurks at every moment during that war when battling guerrilla fighters. Finally at sundown, Joker leads some men to a building where the sniper is positioned. The palm trees and fire in the ruins of the city makes for an eerie, oriental temple like atmosphere. The music (like elephant cries) in the background also contributes to this effect. Finally the sniper is found and wounded. It turns out to be a girl. Badly wounded, she prays and then asks the men to mercifully killed her. Animal Mother, a heavy machine gunner (like Rambo), wants her to suffer to death as payback. Joker, on the other hand, compassionately chooses to put her out of her misery. The segment of the movie with the sniper is Kubrick's commentary on that war. The Vietnam war was sold to the Americans and those who fought it as the U.S.'s answer to help liberate that country from communism. Ironically, it was reduced to a frustrating effort on the part of young recruits to fight an invisible enemy who very much hated them for their presence in their country.",10,1,1,19 July 2017
Nightcrawler," sociopathic profession
","Jake Gyllenhaal is naturally cast-ed as Louis Bloom, a nerdy-looking sociopath and thief who is looking for work and will do anything for a buck. He happens upon an accident scene and discovers there is money to be made as a freelance, video journalist. These are video paparazzi who specialize in selling sensationalized, on-location video clips of homicides and gore. Two key elements are required for success: getting the exclusive scoop, and filming a homicidal crime scene where rich whites fall victims to the poor. Louis hires an assistant, Rick, whom he feeds relentless sales pitches about how this two-bit operation will provide him with opportunities and a promising future. During his most graphic and sensationalized video capture, dubbed Horror House, Louis films two fleeing hit men and the license plate of their getaway vehicle. As a followup, he decides to tail the hit men in their vehicle and phone in a 911 tip at a location of his choosing so that he can videotape their arrest. His desire to arrange this exclusive arrest results in cops getting shot and killed, carnage and mayhem on the streets of L.A. in the wake of a high speed pursuit of a hit man by police and his assistant getting killed. All tragic and unnecessary for a sane person but very much necessary for good night's work and pay for a sociopathic nighcrawler.",8,1,1,8 November 2016
Grease," Touches home to all
","This movie strikes a cord to all because of its universal theme. it reminds us of the adolescent days of middle and high school when life was like a sitcom world with our friends and classmates. It was life before the matrix world when all were equal economically and infatuation flourished with the opposite sex. The pranks, slumber parties, drag racing matches, and the intermixing of subgroups of greasers, pink ladies, nurds, good boys and girls, jocks, and teacher's pet types were all part of the ongoing effort to, ironically, define one's self. The finally carnival scene captured the enthusiasm of a sad but understandable parting of that world for seniors when one, from here on out, would get in character each day with a work face and demeanor for the adult world of the stage.",10,3,3,23 March 2018
The Green Mile," Archetypal biblical-like theme of human nature
","I think this movie addresses a universal theme that's almost biblical in nature: Man is basically evil. He will manufacture and rationalize in his own way to distort good (in this case a good man named John Coffey) into evil (Jesus Christ suffered the same fate.) The question pose by this movie as we identify with the main character prison guard Paul Edgecomb(Tom Hanks) who is in the position as a modern day Pontius Pilate is this: When we are faced with what is told to us and packaged to us as evil, and we discover to the contrary, are we bound to be an agent to evil or do we have the backbone and strength of spirit to expose the wrongdoing and act on our principles for what is right? Life is a test and we will pay a dear price for bad choices with our conscience for the rest of our lives.",10,4,7,7 March 2006
Cinderella Man," heart of a fighter is tempered from hardship and struggle
","I think if you summarize this movie, as you would with all good movies, with a single point in mind, you will enjoy it more. I think the point expressed in this movie biography is: a prize fighter's true training is the mental one, the hardening of the spirit that comes from struggle for self and more importantly for those who make life worth living, family. When faced with the prospect of being beaten down, a person left with no other choice will fight back and 'not pull any punches.' This characteristic is famously referred to as 'the heart of the fighter.' Outstanding people in all fields of endeavor probably have had their share of life's struggle that tempered their self-discipline and set the stage for their greatest achievements.",9,0,1,16 January 2006
The Wizard of Oz," Overcoming One's Own Character Limitations is a Daunting Task
","Overcoming one's own character limitations in youth is a necessary but a daunting task. Those who resign themselves to the safe harbor of postponing efforts to take on risks and challenges have their character development set in time. The characters in the movie, the cowardly lion, the heartless tin man, and brainless scarecrow all symbolize the character flaws in Dorothy's real life adult friends back home. To some degree, Dorothy collectively had each one of those flaws. We see in Dorothy an intelligence, courageous, and a good-hearted young lady. When Dorothy suffers a concussion and drifts into a coma, she mentally commits herself to overcoming those flaws. A mental challenge known as the trip down the 'yellow brick road.' Her initial expectation was to painlessly be cured by Wizard of Oz and sent home. The Wizard, however, prescribed an arduous journey that would put to test all her capacities. She would have to confront evil in the world, in the form of the Wicked Witch of the West. From her trial and tribulations would emerge her renewed self. In the process, she would show care, compassion, and a deep concern for her companion's safety and well-being over her own. It was Dorothy's final act of forgiveness and concern towards one who would do her harm that would put her over the threshold.",10,3,4,1 October 2006
