The Longest Yard," Amusing and actually better than expectation
","I hate remakes with a passion, the only movies that are remade are usually classics or near-classics but if they've been done well once why do them again? Only difference between this movie and others I've seen is that i had never seen the original so it was seen with an open mind. And the verdict...a very good bone-breaking, head snapping crunch of a movie. Exciting story, even though the end and storyline was evident from the word GO...or rather ACTION!! The movie unfolds in a rapid pace and doesn't let up...no time to get bored. Sandler gives a sterling performance, one of his better flicks with such intensity rivaled by maybe Punch-Drunk love. Nelly, Chris Rock and the rest of the cast push the movie and its plot, so no dull moments here. This is one remake thats done properly...possibly remade better?And now who's up for Willy Wonka remake?",7,1,3,8 June 2005
