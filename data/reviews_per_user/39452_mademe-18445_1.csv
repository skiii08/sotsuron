Hereditary," Damn good movie... Almost as good as the hype
","Believe the hype... to a degree! A great horror film, and they don't come around very often. The plot does veer off track for the last third of the movie when the whole cult/occult theme kicks in, but up till then I was surprised at how effective and original the movie was. I think it will be a film that gets better with more viewings.",8,0,1,25 August 2018
