Black Swan," A boring done-before psychological thriller....
","My inclination to write this review came from seeing an average rating of above 9.0 (circa Dec 2010), and my opinion that the move merits at most a 2.0 rating.This doesn't really contain spoilers, but I marked it as such just in case.At first the movie attempts to beguile you into thinking that the misfortunes of the emaciated leading actress are the result of jealousy and foul play. That notion looses credibility not far into the movie as scenes possible only in an *imagined* world play themselves out. The alert movie-goer quickly recognizes this and is disappointingly left with the smoldering remains of a Hitchcockian theme we've all seen before: little more than a psychological thriller with random unoriginal scenes representing the psychotic metamorphosis from innocence to darkness. And whether or not the movie's leading characters are well regarded, is immaterial: it's just lipstick on an ugly pig!But perhaps even more psychotic than the movie itself, are the reviewers who gave this movie a 9+ rating (including many perfect 10's). That is their right, of course. But do they actually think this movie approaches the greatness of, say, 'The Godfather' - which enjoys a 9+ rating, and deservedly so.I'm a *reasonably* discerning viewer, so admittedly my scoring is strict. Still, in the coming year I expect this movie to take it's rightful place in the 5.5-ish ratings range.",2,12,33,31 December 2010
