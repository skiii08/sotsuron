Iron Man 3," Casual movie watcher: Entertaining. Marvel/Iron Man fan: A major disappointment
","If you don't know much about the Marvel Universe or don't care, then this movie will be somewhat entertaining. If you are a Marvel/Iron Man fan and know a little bit about the comics and such, this movie will not live up to your expectations. This movie does not do the first two before it any justice. Too much comedy and too little action. I honestly think this is one of the worse Marvel movies made in awhile. Iron Man 3 did not feel like a Marvel superhero movie. Tony Stark spent the majority of the movie out of his Iron Man suit which really disappointed me. War Machine did absolutely nothing in the movie besides knocking down two doors then was taken down easily by a woman with the extremis power. It seems this director tried to take a 'Skyfall' approach to this movie. Sorry, that didn't work. Maybe if there were less comedy moments or attempts at comedy and more action, it could have been better. Wait for it on Netflix...and it pains me to type that.",1,4,8,3 May 2013
