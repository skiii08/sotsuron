Deja Vu," Bad title...disappointment
","The title is completely misleading. This movie has nothing to do with the feeling of Deja Vu (except maybe on the audience's part). This title caused me to expect that the movie was about something else, and I was disappointed because I was not interested in a time-bending movie. A more relevant title would have indicated what I was getting when I rented it.Otherwise, the movie was okay but not spectacular. Denzel did a good job and the special effects were good. Story could have been more interesting. There are better movies on the subject of time travel, etc. but not much on deja vu.",Null,0,1,24 June 2007
