Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Belkie + Tom Green = Borat
","This review contains a spoiler, but I will make sure you know exactly which paragraph to skip.Borat is basically a documentary about real people reacting to a man behaving very strangely.I'm not sure what rating to give this movie. Up until one part near the ending, I might have given it a 7. After the ending I might have given it a 1. Had I known then what I know now, I might have given it a 10. To find out what I'm talking about scroll down past the warning below.Borat is just a character played by the actor Allie G. He has several characters that he plays on his TV show, the silliest of which is a British rapper who says 'Iz' instead of 'am' or 'are'.(Note; in the Cinema, I saw a stand-up cut-out of Borat with two bikini-clad women, with the faces cut out so you could take photos behind it.) Borat was born in Kazakstan. His depiction of Kazakstan, I suspect, bears no resemblance to the actual country. The character is basically designed to offend, Any and anger everyone he comes across. Borat is anti-Semitic, sexist (by western standards), superstitious (as evidenced by his reaction to gypsies), gross, and constantly confused by American technology and customs.Interestingly, the first few people he meets in New Yourk are extremely rude, much ruder than I could imagine anyone in Melbourne being, even with Borat. (We're not perfect, but the first man he meets in the subway introduces himself in a way I can't repeat on IMDb.) He also becomes obsessed with a certain actress who once played a lifeguard.It's further interesting the number of people in America he DOESN'T offend with anti-Semite and pro-war statements. (At one point, while announcing Kazakstan's support of 'Your War of Terror', he has to try very hard to create an awkward silence) At one point he stays in a Bed & Breakfast hosted by a nice elderly Jewish couple. I was cringing, thinking 'Don't be too mean to these people'. He wasn't too mean to their face, but he did do a bad Blair Witch spoof.The... What do you want to call it? 'Best'? 'Worst'? 'Most Offensive'? 'funnigest'? I'll go with 'Worst'.The 'worst' part of the movie is when he and his producer are fighting naked. I suspect they gave Borat a much larger censor bar than was necessary. Strangely, his producer didn't get a censor bar at all.If you didn't like 'South Park; Bigger, Longer & Uncut', avoid this movie like the plague. Otherwise, enjoy! ..DO NOT READ THE BELOW! DO NOT READ THE BELOW!....... Borat attempts to kidnap Pamela Anderson from a book signing with a hand-knitted sack. I must admit that Pamela was a better actress than I thought. I later checked on the internet, and it turns out she was in on the joke. I for one, felt better about that........DO NOT READ THE ABOVE! DO NOT READ THE ABOVE!",Null,2,6,8 December 2006
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Disappointing
","SPOILER ALERT If you could make a movie about Galactus, the biggest and most powerful villain in Marvel mythos, a being capable of actually consuming planets, What would you do? What sorts of cool shots would you do? Well, I for one would actually HAVE HIM IN THE MOVIE. This is like having the hypothetical concept of King Kong alluded to for 90 minutes rather than actually having a giant monkey grab Fae Wray. It's like making a Godzilla movie shot from the point of view of people in the suburbs of New York reading in the Newspaper about Godzilla.Suposedly, some studio exec didn't want Galactus in the movie because that would be 'silly' as opposed to a guy made of rock or Jessica Alba with blue eyes. I'm sorry; Galactus I believe, but Jessica Alba with blue eyes does NOT make any sense. She just looks weird.Now, the scene where Johnny Storm and the Thing switch powers, I have trouble believing that Johnny would be that vein or have such little pity for Ben.Also, I read another review that said 'it was nothing but sexist jokes at Jessica Alba's expense' There was one! The other problem with The Thing and Johnny Storm switching powers is, the whole point of the character is that he's the first super-hero who actually hates being a super-hero. That's his character. He doesn't WANT to be The Thing, he wants to be human, that's the tragedy of the character. But if he keep being given the opportunity to become human, especially of he gets there, but changes his mind 'for the good of the team', that just seems like bad TV writing.And Dr. Doom; Why did they heal him? They should've left him ugly. Like he is in the comics. Why did they magically heal him? There's just... there's no reason to do that. Without any make-up or mask, he just looks like he does on Charmed. So? And having him steal the Board, there's two possible purposes for that; either they're making a Silver Doom toy (wouldn't be surprised if there's one on ebay as I type this) or they were trying to replace the fact that they turned the biggest villain ever into a cloud.And; what are the holes for? the hones sort of make sense in the Silver Surfer cartoon, Galactus has a giant machine with tentacles. But in the movie, Galactus is a cloud, and no explanation is given as to the holes.However, the Silver Surfer himself was good. I bought him as an alien. The Silver Surfer is about the only thing in the movie that didn't suck.",3,2,5,22 July 2007
Transformers," Really good Transformers adaption
","It's almost a buddy movie AND a war movie. There's the bigger story of the war, and there's also the smaller story with the guy, the girl and Bumblebee going on at the same time. The Transformers are all alien robots that possess the ability to scan any other machine and then turn themselves into a copy of it. Usually they tend to add the Autobot or Decepticon symbol somewhere. The Decepticons, at least, also have the ability to produce a holographic representation of a human sitting inside them. The main difference between the Autobots and Decepticons seems to be political; the Autobots refuse to harm humans, whereas the Decepticons want to destroy us all. All of them seem to have learned English and other information about Earth from the Internet.In the smaller story, Bublebee is a teenager's first car. Bumblebee seems almost over-enthusiastic in trying to help the kid get laid. The girl is hot. Picture 'Herbie' meets 'American Pie'. (Well, maybe not American Pie, they don't go that far, but one of those movies)The kid and Bublebee were also being pursued by a police car with the Decepticon symbol on the side. This part of the story reminded me a bit of Terminator T but much bigger and more menacing.One of the great things about this movie, which surprised even me, is that they actually managed to make the Decepticons scary and creepy. Particularly the Helicopter and Soundwave (I think it was Soundwave. The only remotely Soundwave-like thing about it was that it took the form of a DVD player, and Soundwave was a tape player.)Soundwave is a much smaller Decepticon than the others. He seems to be acting basically as a spy. He's this little, almost gremlin-like creature, constantly sneaking around and hiding when humans might see him. He's roughly 30 or 50 cm tall at his full height, whereas the others average 5, 10 meters tall. I won't tell you too much about Megatron.COMPLAINTS; Unlike the cartoon, their design seems to be over-complicated, they seem to break into too many small parts when they transform. Almost as if they were trying too hard to make it look different from a toy. This creates two main problems; A) it makes it allot more difficult to follow or figure out how they transform, which is exactly what was so interesting about Transformers back in the 80's B) It also makes their faces too complicated, which means it's hard to tell them apart. Particularly the Decepticons.In some of the action sequences towards the end, they used shaky cameras and dust just to make it look more 'real'. In fact it just looks shaky. Cinema Varitae is vastly over-rated.",9,1,5,15 July 2007
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," If you're a fan of the original...
","If you're a huge fan of the Gene Wilder version, you won't like this version. If you liked the book better than the Gene Wilder version, you'll like this version better. If your favorite part of the Gene wilder version was Gene Wilder's insane rant in the tunnel, This is the version for you.I suppose I might as well start by comparing the characters; (Yes I'm aware that some of the names are misspelled) VIOLET Bureuguard She's a it younger, but if anything even more of a spoiled bitch than she was in the original. Although her demise...ORGUSTUS GLOOP Pretty much the same as the original, except instead of Ludhiana's he's dressed like Pugsley.Mike Teavea Mike is an updated version of Mike Teavea. In the book he was obsessed with gangster TV shows and always had guns hanging all around him. In the original it was cowboys, but he still has a gun. In this version he's even more obsessed with violence. He's also a hacker and a video game freak. He also knows allot more about science than Wonka does but, as in all three versions, whenever Mike tries to correct him on something, Wonka accuses him of mumbling.Violet Bureuguard I thing the writer came across a small problem with the book; an obsession with bubblegum doesn't really tell you much about her. However, in all three version she's a Guinness world record holder. so the writer exaggerated that aspect of her. In this version she and her mother are obsessed with winning and competing.CHARLIE In all fantasy stories there's always one character who's job is to meet more interesting characters; Luke Skywalker, Frodo, Stanley Tweedle, etc. The funny thing is; in the gene Wilder version, Charlie said he didn't care much for chocolate. Therefore, why would he care about the ticket? This version is closer to the book, in that he's as obsessed with chocolate as Orgustus Gloop, but he's so poor that his family can only afford to give him chocolate once pr year.GRANDPA JOE Is much closer to the book in this version. He's always telling stories about Mr. William Wonka and he's been bedridden for decades until he sees the golden ticket and shoots out of bed (In the book I imagined this allot quicker, like a gunshots, but it's still way quicker than in the gene Wilder version) Right, this review is probably long enough as it is.",10,2,4,11 November 2006
War of the Worlds," Good points and bad points
","To be fair, Spielberg has a difficult task; how to avoid clichés while making an adaption of the book that STARTED the clichés? Well, the first thing you do is read the book and see where the movie got it wrong.In the 50's movie, there's nothing scary about the Aliens. the Tripods are the only Tripods in the universe that don't have legs. And all they do is float slowly and blast things off-screen.In the new movie, the Tripods actually come up from underground. This IN ITSELF is an interesting idea, as is the explanation that the martians had been planing an invasion since before Humans became civilized, but it completely contradicts the Deus Ex Mechana ending.Spielberg, unlike the 1953 version, actually made the Martians and the Tripods scary. Even the heat rays don't seem at all like Star Wars, they basically these beams of white light that instantly cremate humans. this leads to a very creepy scene where Tom Cruise frantically bushes the dust out of his hair, knowing what it used to be.In the 1953 version, there was one scene where a periscope/snake/neck thing (presumably attached to one of the Tripods) goes inside a house to spy on humans. In the old movie it looked like a vacuum cleaner.This happens again tn the new version, but way better. normally I can usually tell when something's CG at first glance, the way it moves is usually a dead giveaway. however, I couldn't see anything wrong with the snake/periscope/eye/thing. It may have actually been MORE fake if it was animatronic. This part of the movie is extremely creepy, not unlike the Velociraptors in Jurassic Park. The thing can HEAR everything but only has one eye. The humans must avoid making even the slightest sound, but must also sneak around the snake-like thing to avoid bing seen by it. This is complicated by the fact that there's a survivalist psycho who thinks he has even a slight chance fighting superior aliens with an ax.The main difference between the 50's version and the new version is like the difference between Godzilla and the scene in Jurassic Park in the kitchen. Godzilla isn't that scary. He might be scary if it was YOUR building being damaged by his tail, but he's not scary, really. His KIDS are scary, though.The whole movie is like the kitchen scene in Jurassic Park, You're only aware of what Tom Cruise knows. When he's running and has no idea what the Tripods are doing behind him, neither do we. To the point where we don't really see enough of the Tripods.",Null,1,2,6 December 2006
Click," Not what I expected at all
","OK, what I expected was a 'wish fulfillment' movie, you know, one of those movies about what we'd all like, like 'Bruce Almighty' or 'Hallow Man'. That's why I went to see it.Did I expect intelligent comedy? No. Drama? No. I knew Adam Sandler was in it, so I expected either 'The Wedding Singer', 'Water Boy' or 'Happy Gilmore'.It is NOT like Bruce Almighty. Sure, we'd all like a remote control that controls the universe, right? But this one starts screwing up way too early in the movie, turning it much too quickly from 'wish fulfillment' to slightly depressing nightmare.I once saw a short film on The Comedy Channel (in Australia) which was much better (but much more difficult to find) A girlfriend is yelling at her lazy boyfriend for doing nothing all day, and he defends himself by saying he did do one thing all day; he fixed the remote. By accident, he quickly discovers he can control her with it. He mutes her, makes her get him a beer and then almost makes her, how shall I put it? he makes her head go very close to him, but then just turns her around and uses her as a footstool. Then he drops the remote and she grabs it, and uses it.",1,2,8,13 December 2006
