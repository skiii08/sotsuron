The Benchwarmers," Good grief.
","Well, you see the posters and watch the commercials, and from getting that idea, you can only blame yourself in being disappointed by this movie. Aside from the 'brown stew' and the nose pickings, I think the Benchwarmers is a complete miss with kids. I found myself rolling my eyes and cringing at every joke, insult and bug chewing. But you know it's what you're kids want to watch or how you feel like spending your night that really matters.Three full-grown adults play ball against a full roster of 9-10 yr. old kids to avenge the kids the team bullied. After seeing the men play, a billionaire decides to sponsor a round-robin tournament with the victor winning a stadium in their honor.Vomit, farting, nose pickings, need I say more? There's plenty more stuff than you really want to know unless you intend to see it. The Benchwarmers is not about acting or story. Really, the three leads cannot be anymore happier that they're still acting. But the movie is frankly somewhat okay for kids, and a total headache for adults. Watch at your own discretion.",2,3,7,10 April 2006
The Incredible Hulk," Cornball climax tops off another been-there, done-that film.
","Fans of The Incredible Hulk rejoice! This is exactly how the Hulk should have been portrayed five years ago. I still have nightmare visions of Nick Nolte flailing his arms about as Bruce's father, followed by his ever-famous prison photo. And no one can blame Ang Lee for wanting to quit movies entirely after that film. He ended up getting revenge on all of us for Brokeback Mountain but I'm straying from the real topic here...Fans of movie-making and films rejoice? Well ... this 'reboot' is a better version than the original but not by much. There are elements of conflict, terror, action, and tension, all crammed into a melodramatic musical score with somewhat way too obvious (hence, boring) direction and screenplay. What keeps The Incredible Hulk from a total belly-up is Edward Norton, William Hurt and Tim Roth can still pull a heck of a performance in spite of everything. The Incredible Hulk's updated look deserves a note too, but five years later, it is to be expected. I'm just happy the Hulk's back I guess. The climactic bout between the Abomination and Hulk failed to deliver. Like the movie itself, the fight was a laughable mess at most, ending in the silliest of fashion. Unless you're a fan of the series, I would not care to recommend it.",3,6,11,16 June 2008
50 First Dates," Two Thumbs Up.
","I hated 'The Wedding Singer.' Still do to this very day. So imagine the glee I had popping in another Ms. Barrymore/Sandler romantic comedy, that played on one of my favorite movies of all time, 'Groundhog Day.' The result is a mixed blessing, with the end result of you despising the Beach Boys in all their chessy glory.Bachelor Sandler plays with the ladies on vacation in Hawaii. Imagine his own surprise when he falls for one of the girls on the island who can't remember him the day after.You know the movie was funny in the first half, until the movie settles in on the reality of Barrymore's condition and gets depressing. The movie does get sad and long. But thankfully, there are some funny moments involving Schneider and the penguin and walruses are better tools than the bloody one-trick ferret in 'Along Came Polly.' I prefer this one compared to the Mrs. Aniston-Pitt/Stiller nightmare.",6,0,0,22 June 2004
The Ring," Good enough remake.
","Congratulations Hollywood for seeing that Japanese horror movies make money. I think I'd like to believe I speak for everyone when I say that you milked the cash cow a bit too much over the years. But I enjoyed The Ring. The American version explains more than the Japanese original and goes a bit deeper into the reasoning of the main antagonist.A bunch of students return from a retreat only to die a horrible death a week later. An investigative journalist thinks this story goes a bit deeper. She finds out that they all watched this videotape that kills you seven days to the minute you view it.Would you believe an idea like this? I felt like there was something missing from the American version. I couldn't be drawn into the suspense and terror that existed in Japanese. I think they did an excellent job in introducing Samara. And overall, the movie is well made and I would recommend it to anyone curious. Give it a try if you haven't seen it yet.",7,0,1,3 October 2005
Kung Fu Panda," Fun film for the family.
","One perfect way to make Jack Black not too annoying: make him a cute computer-generated panda! Another fun, if not all too predictable film, has Po the Panda, a cook for his father's noodle shop, selected as being the legendary Dragon Warrior, much to the chagrin of five kung-fu artists and their master, who have spent their lives and then some trying to attain that goal.The movie is entirely predictable. Don't expect something different or unique done to the status quo of computer-generated animation and storytelling. But of that, Kung Fu Panda is much more entertaining than some of the other recent, past efforts, and the quality is above par as well! I found myself not minding Kung Fu Panda. Jack Black's voice is softer than his other films so Po's character isn't your usual Jack Black-like character. Thumbs up for a job well done.",6,4,7,15 June 2008
Chinatown," What a movie.
","If ever you want to see a fine mystery, deserving in all its praise, look no further than Chinatown. The movie takes time to pick up, held together by none other than Nicholson, in a prime role, until the pieces of the puzzle start coming together. Once there, you cannot help it, but ultimately your eyes will be glued to the screen until, just when you think you've seen everything, Chinatown pulls a couple more twists out of its hat that will leave you stunned, right to the very end.1930's Los Angeles. Private dick, Jake Gittes, is making his living doing the standard routine, exposing affairs. Evelyn Mulwray, wife of the owner of LA's water works, suspects the same thing of her husband and hires Jake for the job. Little does Jake know yet how deep this river actually goes...Simply put, if you have a passion for movies, than you must not miss Chinatown. The film is well-deserving for all of its nominations and awards. The actors and actresses are first-rate, music suits the film, the wit and character that comes right out of the script, and the last few lines spoken by Gittes and his pal. My friends, don't miss this film.",9,0,1,16 August 2007
Star Trek," A successful reboot.
","I remember in 2003 a survey in TV Guide. One of the questions was 'Is Star Trek dead?' 84% responded 'Yes.' I can tell you six years ago, I would not have thought of rebooting the franchise through recasting the original crew and providing the scapegoat that The Original Series is an alternate reality to the one we know now. And thank God, it worked. Abrams, Orci and Kurtzman have successfully revived a dead franchise, one I watched my whole sad life bringing youth, personality and a better vision of what it would be like traveling through space. I liked it. The movie as is though, does not hold up. Poor Eric Bana, not doing much of anything since Brad Pitt slaughtered him in Troy, is stuck with the tiring vengeful character that crippled the Star Trek universe in the first place (Shinzon in Nemesis, Ru' afo in Insurrection and Soran in Generations), reduced to el-lame-o lines such as 'Fire everything!' and 'I'd rather watch my world die a thousand times than give up to you,' or something or other. Next you unnecessarily pair up Scotty with a midget alien sidekick. Couldn't you at least give the poor guy a lady friend? And my last complaint is portraying an Orion girl, known for seduction, as a ditz of the highest order? *sigh* I'm done. I look forward to the next film. This could be the start of something great.",6,1,10,24 June 2009
Underworld," Pointless
","Underworld is, as Bill Nighy once said, one of those movies that has everything in it. At two hours though, the movie is draining to watch and requires multiple viewings to understand the story and the world that is made, essentially, from the ground up by Len Wiseman himself. As a comic book fan, I enjoyed it. As a movie fan, I did not. Most of the movie speaks in riddles, and the curtain opening scene will probably lose many viewers. I really did not enjoy how it played out as a film, but there is something about Underworld that helped me watch it from beginning to end.A six-hundred years war between vampires and werewolves is about to end as the final pieces of a chess game are played between its major players.I think of this film as a pure urban movie. There are many guns, many players, much grit in its choreography. Stylistically, the film is perfect. It's perfect camp and once you piece together the story, it is an enjoyable film altogether. The film stays true to the whole myth of vampires and the Lycans, as the werewolves are called, are exceptionally put together. If you plan on watching the sequel, I recommend the original as a must first.",4,1,4,21 January 2006
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Much better than you would think.
","After Knocked Up and The 40 Yr. Old Virgin, I was surprised to see Judd Apatow's newest film, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, maintain the same success as the earlier films. Try this as a surprise, Sarah Marshall is Judd's best film yet. There's far more comedy in this film than the previous efforts and the actors are perfectly suited for the film. Easily this is Jason Segel's best work and is the perfect vehicle for Russell Brand, whose Aldous Snow virtually stole the show and Mila Kunis, as this film was her best performance as of yet.Although Aldous Snow stole the show, with some of the best one-liners ever, everyone in the movie you come to laugh at and enjoy. It was a pleasant surprise to see everyone have a happy ending and that the movie was actually really good! With Judd's recent effort, hopefully the way of the one-joke movie will finally die off and make way for entertaining comedies such as Forgetting Sarah Marshall.",8,2,7,4 May 2008
Beauty and the Beast," One of Disney's Best!
","Beauty and the Beast is an engaging movie with so much care and beauty fused into its core. Beauty is much more than just an influential animated classic. It is a grand and powerful fable, sugar coated with the best animation effort in a time where CGI was becoming a movie mainstay. In its finest moments, Beauty is a rousing musical, making your head move and getting caught up right in the mix. The score is unforgettable and the characters are so easy to get into. A movie that children and adults alike will love, Disney deserved its Academy Award nominations for creating such a joy.Small town Belle longs for more than a local life, maintaining her imagination through books and taking care of her kind, yet eccentric father. But when their horse returns without papa, Belle sets out to find the awful truth in an enchanted castle.You can see that so much time and care was spent in drawing this masterpiece. I cannot think of many other movies that show such meticulous background and animation. That such effort is woven effortlessly into its songs that make Beauty and the Beast the timeless classic Disney rightfully lauds itself over. 'Be Our Guest,' 'Beauty and the Beast,' 'Gaston,' you will be humming these songs at one point in your your life! Kudos to Disney for creating a charismatic, attractive villain in Gaston. He would not be a villain if he was not such a jerk. You must watch this movie at least once in your life, in a comfortable sofa and with the sound turned right up for the Broadway scores. You will enjoy it!",9,95,110,23 January 2005
Madagascar," Largely indifferent about the whole thing.
","If you've seen the previous Dreamworks Animation movie, Shark Tale, then you can expect more or less the same loud, in-your-face, mentality that made the first movie a success. Both use New York as a setting, borrow loud booming music from years' past, and reference movies and TV to keep adults awake. With the exception of the show-stealing penguins however, Madagascar is more geared towards short-attention span children as, once again, the imaginative use of CGI of the animals save this movie from a snoring audience.At the Central Park Zoo, Marty the zebra escapes towards Conneticut to find out what life is like in the wild. His friends, Alex, Gloria and Melman, stop him at Grand Central Station only for them to be captured and ended up put back in the wild.During the movie, there's a reference to the original Planet of the Apes. Hearing this, you automatically know it has to be one of two scenes, and that's the whole point I'm trying to make. Madagascar's references stink and just drives home another point: there's not a shred of originality in the movie. There's another reference to an episode of The Twilight Zone ('To Serve Lemur', ho ho), which kids will obviously not get since it was over 40 years ago and that's how the movie will be like to adults. Aside from the references in the movie, there's also the morals. There's a lemur that gets up and sings to, 'I Like to Move It,' from Reel 2 Reel. Which is fine, and throughout the movie there's word switching to references for the kids, but this King Lemur is dancing with a bunch of girls, telling them how much he likes their bodies moving and how to do it. Once again, I have no problems with a promiscuous lemur (do you?), but this being a kids movie, I would have preferred him to say how much he likes kids, instead of girls, to get up and dance, and there would be a bunch of children in the theater aisles dancing for ten-fifteen minutes and parents would be happy. We also see the animals accepting life being marooned in the middle of nowhere, so they try sea-water. They spray it all over the place and for about five minutes we see our kids laugh and get it in their heads that spraying their drink all over the dining table is largely acceptable because, you know, it tastes like seawater. If your children insist, I suggest renting the movie since there are far better movies being pumped out this year, but if they loved Shark Tale, they will no doubt love this movie just the same.",4,0,2,7 July 2005
The Girl Next Door," Absolute Garbage.
","I never laughed. I remember before watching Eurotrip, the trailer kicked up for The Girl Next Door and everyone was excited that this movie was a hilarious teen comedy with much potential. Let me tell you, your I.Q. will drop twenty points before you can make any sense of this. What hurts even more was the lack of chemistry between any of the characters. There seems to be no morality, let alone respect of any of the characters as they are to do stupid, idiotic things that no one, NO ONE would ever participate or be a part in. Look at the negative reviews more than the positive ones. They tell the truth. Comparing this monstrosity to Risky Business is cause for a head examination. That movie isn't so fresh either, but it's not as insulting to the intelligence as The Girl Next Door is. Stay away.",1,8,20,2 October 2004
Balls of Fury," It could have been so much more.
","If you enjoy martial arts films, parodies, campiness and the occasional fart joke, Balls of Fury has it. But the train never really picked up steam. Unlike Naked Gun and Airplane!, Balls doesn't really open up with a lot of jokes in the first place. The movie opens up the usual martial arts story (father dies, son is shamed) where the only highlight is a crazed East German. The first real funny joke is 15 min in where, you guessed it, the well-timed fart joke continues the story. They could have done so much more than this, obviously! 12yr. old ping-pong sensation Randy Daytona fails his country, his father and himself at the '88 Seoul Olympics. It costs his gambling Dad his life while Randy further ruins his by headlining shows in Reno. But an FBI agent needs to catch the man responsible for murdering Randy's father and forces Daytona back in ship-shape so they attract Feng's invitation to his ping-pong tournament.Balls of Fury's real grace is the clever parodying of all films dealing with martial arts. We have the cricket, the Dragon, Feng's secret lair in Central America, Gary. And the movie wastes no time on what could have wasted our own. We know that Randy would win the rematch against Karl, that ten seconds on Fogler dancing to Def Leppard is too much for anyone, and that one or two Scarface references by an agent wishing he would have been James Bond is good enough. Once again, Balls of Fury is a good film, but it could have been way much better.",2,3,6,3 September 2007
Spider-Man 2," Definitively, one of the best in its genre.
","The sequel to the Spider-Man movie is everything a fan of the first could ask for. Imagine the surprise to see such care, effort and appreciation put into every character within the movie, with excellent acting, direction, sound, computer animation... all of it seamlessly integrated into a film that is very aware of the history, the fandom, and the expectations associated with the Spider-Man franchise. Spider-Man 2 is the perfect film for the comic book genre, and the perfect sequel for Spider-Man fans. Aside from the flawless animation and choreography staged between the Spider-Man/Doctor Octopus fights, we get to the real core of Peter Parker, when he makes a real attempt back at normal life, after events allow him so. Seeing Peter Parker deal with day-to-day life honestly, in an environment unintentionally nudging against him in all areas, makes this film a real gem, and Tobey Maguire should give himself a pat on the back for what a good film he's put together.While Peter Parker deals with him losing a job, failing school, missing rent and straining to meet Mary Jane at the cost of being Spider-Man, an idol of his, Dr. Otto Octavius, whom his very project is on, receives sponsorship from his friend, Harry, to work his experiment on fusion. After the experiment goes horribly wrong, Octavius loses control of his senses and plots to finish his job no matter the cost.One of the best scenes has to be when Peter comes clean to Aunt May about what really happened to Uncle Ben. Here, the script and director could have done anything to make the scene anything else but what it was but they didn't. Those types of scenes, included along with relating to Mary Jane and saving whatever he kept holding onto with her, worked because of the exceptional acting and direction involved in knowing that they were creating a great film. Spider-Man 2 is one of the best sequels of all time, and if you loved the first movie, the second will not disappoint. Everyone involved in this film, should give themselves a hand because Spider-Man 2 lived up to its namesake as a film that you could enjoy over and over and never tire of. Every scene is never wasted, and I give the film two thumbs way up for ingenuity and imagination, for bringing the web-crawling hero a greater movie than one could think possible.",9,8,11,31 October 2007
Batman Returns," What makes a sequel? More stuff.
","Growing up, Batman Returns was one of my favorite movies as a child. It pains me slightly to watch it today, for what I thought then was flawless, is now rather over-the-top and melodramatic. But the production is beautiful and I will never forget Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman. At the time, I thought she was God's greatest, sexiest gift to mankind.Batman's back and instead of one headache, he now has three: the Penguin, Catwoman and Max Schreck.Everything about Batman Returns is about more. More explosions, bad guys, gadgets, decoration. It's all on a grand scale. Unfortunately the script is not up to snuff, but the makeup of the Penguin is excellent, and the costumes are excellent, especially the Catwoman's! I couldn't figure out if Christopher Walken even tried in his character or if he was truly necessary. Thankfully, the Gotham scenery and the other actors' efforts catapult it above ground.",7,1,2,20 June 2005
Superbad," Well thought up.
","One of the better teen adventure comedies in some time, Superbad delivers the goods on many things, as it touches on every subject that deals with teenage life, and then some. The script begins innocently enough, but once Fogell enters the beer store, all bets are off as one strange twist after another has you laughing and wondering just what the heck is going to happen next. And no matter what's happening to poor Seth and Evan throughout, our thoughts are still on the officers and Fogell.Seth and Evan are invited to the year-end party at Jules and also mention they can provide the booze too! Their hopes rest on Fogell, whose fake ID makes him McLovin, a 25yr. old organ donor from Hawaii!Many of the twists the poor kids go through are just strange. When the girl just shows up and starts dancing with Seth. Or when Evan gets stuck singing Burton Cummings with the addicts. Or the strange bum ('Hey McMuffin!'). But aside from that and the funk soundtrack, Superbad always has you watching to see what happens next. The movie is no advocate for teenage drinking. It's quite the opposite, and despite the cops' antics and track covering, you'll learn never to spit on one. No matter how strange and adventurous the movie may be, the endless talking also brings out the inevitable feminine side between the Seth and Evan in another strange but hilarious moment in Superbad. It's a good movie and one for the times.",7,1,4,3 September 2007
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Jackman and Schreiber the lone highlights.
","I've always been a fan of Schreiber, and Jackman has survived well enough to earn my respect. With that said, well, Wolverine isn't bad but hardly great either. Clues throughout the film tip the plot grudgingly forward as actors say some of the worst lines that anyone can get paid to say, and if the action strays from Hugh, the film is a shameless bore. Hugh knows Wolverine and captures the best of the hero's moments despite the shortcomings of all the other characters we could hope would live up to, such as Blob or Gambit. If you have the best surround system at home with the best TV, Wolverine would be perfect for a home viewing, where any cheesiness that oozes out of the screen, can be handled with a beer, or two.... or three.",4,3,8,11 May 2009
Constantine," Indifference reigns.
","I saw Constantine with the hopes that it was not your typical comic book movie, playing to all the audiences it usually does. I can see they didn't want to mess with the formula. Constantine lays the same cards every movie of its ilk have played. They didn't even try to stray from the mediocrity that is a dark action flick. Keanu should know better, but when Hollywood is cutting the check, I guess the rules go for anything innovative.The Spear of Destiny, laced with the blood of the Son of God and draped in a Nazi flag, is unearthed in Mexico(!). The carrier heads off towards Los Angeles where Constantine, demon hunter extraordinaire, meets a cop who's twin sister referred him in the most unusual of ways.Have your bad-ass anti-hero? Check! Have your dark past? Check! Have a beautiful woman who needs your help? Check! Have some fated friends? Check! Have your eccentric inventor help? Check! Fighting evil demons to prevent an apocalypse? Check! Have a *gasp* 'shocking' twist toward the end? Check! And overall, have your miserable story with unexplained scenes and unintentionally funny moments? Darn right! Seems like the same formula here. I diagnose this movie with that contagious herpes: comic-book formulaic garbage! Symptoms may include: boredom, rolling of the eyes, occasional dozing and plenty of laughs. Prognosis: watch at your own risk!",3,30,62,28 February 2005
Troy," Two Thumbs Up
","In my eyes, the action in Troy works. The one-on-one fights in the movie are well-filmed and nicely choreographed. The casting is perfect. Troy rocks and, if not for some lengthy moments, could have found its own place among other epics, such as Spartacus or Braveheart.Prince of Troy runs off with Greek ruler's wife. This is just the sort of excuse Greece needs to send its entire army, with brooding champion hero Achilles in tow, to wipe out the Trojans.The best moment in Troy is when the King, played by Peter O' Toole pleads to Achilles to return his son. Our screenwriter has made the heroes as human as possible, and lets the audience decide whom to pass judgment on. Aside from the unnecessary armies expected in a movie such as the Rings' Return of the King, Troy is a very deep movie, that creates its own myth, or tragedy, if you will.",7,4,8,1 June 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Disappointing.
","Well, wouldn't you know it, the world is coming to an end and once again, it's all our fault! This disaster-piece destroys Emmerich's favourite targets: New York, Los Angeles and Washington! Unfortunately, there are not enough Americans running for their lives in this feature as the dozen or so people we are forced to sit around and watch flatline the movie to death as best they can.Three super-hurricanes descend upon the Earth and create a new ice age in a way that only Roland Emmerich can understand.A dozen or so actors show up and the only character the audience cared about was the homeless guy with his intuitive dog. The hope of seeing a true disaster movie as everyone getting demolished or maybe even a type of actioner where mankind does their physical best against nature would have been better and more fun. Seeing the disasters might be a well rent, but the acting is more dulling of the mind if anything. This disaster-piece failed to deliver.",4,1,3,12 June 2004
Spider-Man 3," Spider-Man not so friendly.
","Many years ago, I never thought Spider-Man would work in the movies. But they pulled it off. Then, upon the news, I never thought Doctor Octopus would be an easy pull. But it worked and Spider-Man 2 was amazing. Then the news of Venom and the Sandman teaming up on Peter, all on the heels of Harry finding out his true identity, sounded a little too much. And Spider-Man 3, despite an excellent beginning and a good, but implausible, climax, was way too much. Imagine an Oreo cookie, if you will, where the ends were perfect but the filling was maple-flavored rather than vanilla or chocolate.Life for Peter Parker couldn't be better. Fans adore him, MJ has stood by him and he's succeeding in school. But his best friend is out to kill him, and a new twist on how his Uncle Ben died has come up. All this, tied to a couple other lapses in judgment, have Peter trying to find quick answers to solutions. One solution literally clings itself to him and makes things only worse.It was hard to taste, watching Peter look emo as the face of aggression, scaring his landlord and MJ, while creeping out passer-bys and Jonah himself. A particular scene, where Peter takes Gwen to a jazz club where MJ works, just didn't work. I feel Avi Arad made a mistake in convincing Raimi to put Venom in the film because by the time it took to establish the character and it's reasons for being, that time already wasted two-thirds of the film and Brock just doesn't last too long after. That's not to discount the eventual confrontations between Harry and Peter though. Their relationship became more complex throughout the movie, made even a little more bizarre by one agreeing to help the other in the wake of all what happens. It's also something I believe that Alvin Sargeant was right on: they should have made two films of Spider-Man 3, with the first ending very much like The Empire Strikes Back. Spider-Man 3 was a very good movie, a potential to make it better is gone now, but the end product is nothing to complain about. Fans of the first two will not be disappointed and seeing the battle royale at the end is worth the price in itself.",6,0,1,1 November 2007
The Terminator," One of science fiction's best movies.
","Excellent, excellent film. For being over twenty years old, the effects hold up well. The lovely Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger are perfect for their roles. Few movies are better paced as The Terminator boasts some of the finest lines and visuals in film history. I suggest to anyone who is interested in science fiction, that you must watch this movie.It's Los Angeles and 1984. Two beings from the future, one a killing cyborg, the other a skilled fighting human, come to the present seeking the same woman, Sarah Connor. She holds the key to the future in her son, who's not even a thought to her mind before the cyborg starts killing every Sarah Connor in the phone book.What makes Terminator a science fiction classic is how you can compare the movie to real life. Before computers became a mandatory household luxury, there was already a vision that we would overly rely on them and this movie does an excellent job in giving us a fantastic worst-case scenario, playing on our fears and imagination. The scene at the police station is one of my personal favorites. The music is excellent, the direction is sharp, and everyone is in top form. The Terminator is perfect science fiction.",10,1,1,23 May 2006
Cloverfield," Monstrous Ingenuity.
","Be it as it may, there was tremendous ingenuity in putting together a Blair Witch Project-type camcorder and making it a Godzilla experience. Cloverfield is a brilliant experiment and the lack of monster movies in this day and age only added to my interest in seeing this film. The end result is a mixed feeling, mind you. Poor Hud can't film worth squat and many scenes have you scratching your head, wondering what's going on. On top of that, the story is a little too flaky. After getting a single call from your lady friend, you decide to go to the main battleground of where the monster is to get her? She doesn't even send texts to keep in touch! Nevermind that a couple of the characters are mere acquaintances that don't have a heck of a lot in common with the main characters.But Cloverfield is an interesting movie. Seeing the perspective of the monster and the little bugs it shakes out that attack and bite people, is a truly terrifying experience which makes Cloverfield more closer in line with the horror genre than other giant monster movies like King Kong or Godzilla. In Cloverfield, no one really has a happy ending, which could include you if you're not prepared for shaky camcorder antics again, but the film holds its own well enough to enjoy the end of New York as we know it.",5,0,1,8 May 2008
Sleepy Hollow," Thumbs Up.
","Tim Burton loves film-making and, thankfully, he and the production crew for Sleepy Hollow have created here a perfect blend of art and action that anyone can tolerate and enjoy. I pretty much forgot that Tim created 'Mars Attacks!' before this.An outspoken constable, smooth on theory but weak in practice, gets sent from New York up the Hudson Highlands to the small town of Sleepy Hollow, to investigate a series of murders.What's great about the movie, aside from the hauntingly beautiful town that was built, are the near-perfect casting of characters that inhabit and drive Sleepy Hollow. If you want a perfect example of a good Burton movie, this is it. We've all seen the familiar pursuit scenes before and there is a certain disturbing scene, that Tim Burton could not help but say, 'One of my favorite scenes, don't ask me why.' Otherwise, an entertaining feature.",7,1,2,27 April 2004
The Bodyguard," Not as bad as the voters think.
","You know, I was looking at IMDb's database on romance and was pretty stricken to see that not only 'Vertigo' was rated a romance(!), but five of the top twenty were written around and before fifty decades ago. Ghost? Nope! Dirty Dancing? Ha! Try 5.3. Titanic? 9100 votes gave it a 1. Ever After? Female votes have scraped it up to a 7! Wedding Singer, Pretty Woman, GREASE of all movies. Modern romance has been beaten to a pulp, but even though the same conventions of romance movies exist in The Bodyguard, I'm not one of those people who hated it.After missing out on Reagan's assassination attempt, bodyguard Frank Farmer is now working for-hire. When a singer hires him after she gets death threats, conflicts begin but feelings follow.The Bodyguard plays out your basic romance and resists the urge to jerk any tears. I don't think the actors could pull it off though. There's a point in the movie, when they realize their romance, when their reactions don't make any sense, but afterward everything about the movie plays out like it should and it's well made! Although I believe people are rating the movie on what has happened to Whitney Houston in recent years, they should judge it for the performances themselves and that means it's not bad.",7,1,5,15 February 2005
Knocked Up," Making a relationship work...
","Knocked Up is an interesting film that could involve a very serious subject. What if you became pregnant from someone who does little but smoke, give movie references, has nothing but junk (eg. ninja knives?) and has no real job. Heck, he's even in the country illegally! Would he even read up on pregnancy? Would you be like Allison and give the relationship a shot? Or would you eventually just try to make things work with your family in regards to bringing the baby into this world? I felt like the sentimentality dominated the film more than the issue of time. Even after seeing a heartbeat, the baby growing, the hormones, that Ben didn't try harder until Allison kicked him out.Ben Stone and his buddies go out for a night on the town. He runs into a successful woman in the entertainment industry who just recently won a promotion. After a drunken, hurried one night stand, she ends up pregnant.I found Knocked Up to be a little harsh in its views, as Ben threw any integrity out the window for the sake of his blunt and unethical honesty. In the end, everybody seems to do what's right at the last second, only in the face of a crisis mind you, but Knocked Up is a happy ending. I thought Katherine Heigl did an excellent job as Allison, as her character grew more adjusted to Ben and his buddies. Leslie Mann also pulled out a great performance too. Judd Apatow probably has pulled out his best work here to date. Many questions I ask, mainly what was Pete thinking about when him and Ben went to the strip club in Vegas? Would Allison have called Ben if their doctor wasn't available? What was really up with that Pete guy anyway? Lastly, did anybody really think of this as a romance comedy, cause aside from Ben's slacker friends picking up the one who couldn't shave, I couldn't find myself laughing at anything!",6,0,1,28 October 2007
Nacho Libre," A unique treat for everyone.
","I have fallen asleep every time I watch Napoleon Dynamite. Without fail. But aside from embarrassing myself to every reader, I have to say that I did not mind Nacho Libre at all. The dialog is fine yes, and fart jokes are strategically, if not diabolically, placed from scene to scene. But Nacho is very much a visual film. A treat for the eyes where, with the obvious exception of Ana de la Reguera, actors are not beautiful or glamorous or drowned out in makeup but are real. Their faces have more expressive character than anyone in Hollywood does and, with that foundation, you can build a comedy around that, package it, and let the talent do the rest. With that in mind, I have to say Nacho Libre is a fantastic movie in its own right and Jack Black, well, he just runs wherever the script lets him.Ignacio grows up all his life wanting to be a luchador. The monastery slaps a ladle and pot in his hands and makes him cook to make some kind of use of him. But inspiration returns to him when he sees a chance at making money in the sport he so often wanted to do.Jared Hess made a smart move by letting Jack Black run around with the film. From making Ignacio sing for Encarnacion or Ramses, the comedy comes from Black's wit in knowing how Hess wants the film. Extra thumbs up goes to Nacho's partner, Esqueleto, who lets Hess run wild with his unusual imagination. No one knows really the hows or whys of Esqueleto's stance on science, or relationships, or even orphans for that matter but Jimenez delivers the punches. I recommend Nacho to everyone who loved Dynamite. Hess delivers a Hollywood ending, but throws it so over the top that only your inner 4yr. old might laugh for it. Visually, I enjoyed the real world look of Nacho Libre, with the comedy being a plus. But if you look for consistency and you lack the patience of what could be a generally silent film, maybe wait till it comes out for the home.",6,20,39,16 June 2006
Lost in Translation," Excellent.
","'Lost in Translation' is definitely not for everyone. It is quiet, sombre, reflective, at times a depressing reminder, and a very hard movie to watch for someone accustomed to the multiplexes and expectant of a Hollywood feature with style and attitude. But guess what, this movie is art and is unbelievably beautiful. I have never seen anything this real in a long time.American actor Bob Harris is suffering the results of working in Japan and being married after many years. Charlotte is a student graduate who is suffering the marriage cracks after two years. They find each other lost in Tokyo and a friendship begins.Score one for 'L.I.T' is the absence of unnecessary music. The absence of something melodramatic to fill the mood was the biggest factor to making the film work. You can concentrate on understanding the characters and appreciating the world they are lost in. Score two: the acting. The subtle tones imply of people who are laid low by exactly what they are lost in. Murray and Ms. Johansson are perfect. Score three was seeing this movie never get caught up more than what it actually is, of two people finding and coping through each other from the worlds they are put through. I could go on forever, but to put it simply, if you like the big Hollywood features, do not watch this. People who ponder their existence and wonder what it's like through art, 'Lost in Translation' is your ticket.",8,0,1,20 July 2004
Corpse Bride," Cautious thumbs up.
","Well thought, very entertaining picture, done much the same way as Burton's smash, Nighhtmare Before Christmas, Corpse Bride will get applause everywhere it's watched. If there's a movie Tim's directed that hasn't been critically acclaimed, let me know. Get ready for music, wit, charm but ... and it's a big but, be also prepared for spiders, maggots and a serious storyline that might leave people scratching their heads at the end.A musical opens the movie explaining the son of a rich merchant family and the daughter of high class paupers are arranging to marry off their kids to save themselves. Victor and Victoria seem fine with each other, but after a botched rehearsal the groom to be practices his vows to a tree stump, only for it to accept them in the form of a corpse in a wedding gown.I enjoyed the characters in Corpse Bride. There is a kind of realism on how Emily and Victoria relate to Victor, and each other, that keep the movie going. That's not to dismiss the dead, all of whom own the movie, which I guess is the dramatic irony throughout the Corpse Bride: the afterlife is bursting with more liveliness than the living! Burton however, takes the Corpse Bride much more seriously than I would have expected, reminding us that Emily's ending was, and would, as bittersweet as the movie itself. I was thoroughly entertained, but aside from those determined to see the movie anyway, I would not know who to recommend the movie to.",7,1,2,3 October 2005
The Aviator," A beautiful look at the life and times of...
","Martin Scorsese has done a magnificent job directing the life and story of an eccentric businessman/filmmaker. I think the production has told an intriguing and carefully thought story of the life of Howard Hughes. I recommend this movie to everyone who believe that truth is indeed more fascinating than fiction. The Aviator has dramatized (and, to a lesser degree, romanticized) real life, but the effect only betters the movie. After all, this is Hollywood we're dealing with.It's 1930, and $4 million dollars later, Howard Hughes has created the most expensive movie yet. The flying Great War epic isn't enough for the young Texan as he plans on taking the aviation industry by storm.I enjoyed the perspective of Hollywood in the 30s. There's a magnificent view placed in the movie that makes you wonder if you would be looking through the eyes of Howard Hughes if he was in your seat itself. I would not be surprised if Ms. Blanchett is nominated at the Academy Awards. If you're not into biographical movies, then her performance of Katharine Hepburn deserves some notice. Look for cameos by Gwen Stefani and Jude Law. I didn't recognize the latter. It was a good movie and I wouldn't mind watching it again. But nearly tipping the scales at just under three hours, make sure you get comfortable, with your toilet breaks done and over with.",9,0,1,16 January 2005
"I, Robot"," Two Thumbs Up.
","Will Smith seems to have no trouble attracting and winning multiplex goers. Will there be a time when this success finally runs out? Even Smith probably ponders the same question (and invests for insurance albeit). His latest feature graduates from the usual alien foe of his to robots. It's a whodunnit, and average in intense action to say the least, but surprise! This movie is not as bad as critics are stomping all over it.Chicago, 2035. Spooner is a cop with a secret and a distrust in robots. When founder of U.S. Robotics dies from a very high plunge, the alleged suicide gets a little more attention when Spooner spots a robot still at the scene of the crime.You know, 'I, Robot' may feel average and there are some dragging parts in between action but there is a certain explosive feel about the movie that makes you admit some parts are cool. The typical pursuit scene everyone knows of gets a little creativity and Proyas adds his own little touches here and there to make the movie all the more enjoyable to watch. It's not great, but it's still one of the better ones.",7,0,0,20 July 2004
Over the Hedge," Very impressed, actually consistent movie.
","Computer animation is something I'm really growing out of. Madagascar? Hated it. Robots? Slept through it. Over the Hedge though was a very nice sigh of relief for the animation industry. Yes, some of it we have seen so many times over, I have quit many movies out of boring disgust. But after the curtain opener, the movie begins with an amazing visual of forestry that rests you into the movie. The characters are also something we've all seen before too. The possum father/daughter combo, the family porcupines, the token skunk, the characters are beside the point, not to mention their scenes are all stolen essentially by the brilliant use of Hammy. From the use of red lights to caffeine to 'rabbit' squirrels, Hammy and RJ own every scene they're in and are worth the admission ticket themselves.A raccoon, starving for food, unwisely tries to steal a bear's stash. RJ is caught and is given roughly a week to recover it and then some. He runs into a family of 'foragers,' who have their own problems in the name of one Steve. Steve is a hedge and beyond it now lies a suburb that was built up over the winter.Everything about Over the Hedge is very standard for computer animated films. You learn the same morals (families love you), see some silly movie references ('ROSEBUD!'), yada yada. But something about this movie keeps the same stuff sharp. It's crisp. The climax is very solid, the voice over work is just as good. It's a good film and you may just enjoy it.",7,0,1,17 June 2006
Van Helsing," Waste of Life
","Seriously, I have never heard a more collective groan from an audience in a good while. Aside from the design and look of Van Helsing, this hole has nothing going for it. Boring, unintentionally funny, the cheesiness, all of those little words that say, 'I'm garbage,' this turkey has them all. Please for the love of your intelligence and sanity, do not watch this.Superhero Van Helsing is sent by secret priesthood in Rome to dispatch Dracula, who has plans to give life to his ugly offspring.One big mistake on the box is they forget to mention ages 6-14 only. Second big mistake was the awful CGI. The entire movie was collective garbage sadly and Jackman and Beckinsale (whose optical illusion/corset outfit will appeal to teens), deserve better. And so does the audience. The 'Big Three' do not deliver here. The Brides are a waste of screen time sadly. This movie sucked.COMPLETE SPOILER: If Anna never saw the sea, the least you could have done to ease the audience is to let her see it or bury her in it! This further buried Van Helsing.",2,0,0,9 May 2004
Spider-Man," Two Thumbs Up.
","Spider-Man finally moved it to the movie screen and it was about time. The computer effects lived up to its end of the bargain and the actors did the best they could to make the movie a further success, but the action was left wanting. Not to mention the costuming of the Green Goblin was a joke and a half. For a movie that demands drama in its characters, where's that fair share in the action when we're sitting for two hours?Nerdy, anti-social teenager Peter Parker gets bitten by a radioactive spider. His world never becomes the same.Spider-Man's 'origin' story stays true to its roots and everything is perfect on the comic side. Mess with Stan Lee's, 'With Great Power comes Great Responsibility' moral and you're in big trouble. But the ferocity of the fights between Spider-Man and Green Goblin were terribly anti-climactic until the end when, even then, they were beating each other up instead of showing a good dramatic fight. In the end, it was good to see Spidey on the movie screen, even when dull at some moments.",6,0,0,20 July 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Two Thumbs Up.
","The first thing you will notice about the third Harry Potter movie is that the direction is completely different from the first two. Azkaban is much darker, more enchanted and, let's face it, a much more grown up movie than the previous two. Harry Potter is growing up! And whether this is a good or bad thing is left for the viewer to decide. One thing for certain is the series is truly going down a more darker, more sinister path.After exiling himself from his muggle family world, Harry finds his way back to Hogwarts with the knowledge that a prisoner of Azkaban escaped and is set to kill him. Harry learns more about himself and others as he deals with puberty and his newest opponents, the Dementors.If kids thought the Chamber of Secrets was dark and long, you haven't seen the Dementors yet. Prisoner carries a sort of dark artistry that enchants Harry Potter instead of taking it away from the movie. Where the first two were more plot-driven and focused solely on the characters, Azkaban concentrates a little bit more on the world of Hogwarts and assumes you probably know of Harry, his friends and his mainstay teachers. With a lot of patience, since the movie is long, and a fair grain of salt for the plot twists and time travel toward the end, Harry Potter 3 is a good movie that makes well use of Hogwarts that adds to the series more than taking away.",7,0,0,7 June 2004
The Fast and the Furious," Remains a decent racing film.
","Even after two sequels, Fast and the Furious kept the racing genre very well alive in the 2000s. The film still retains much of the fast action, well paced storytelling and cheesy, yet clever, one-liners. As far as thrillers go, it's pretty hard to beat the botched hijacking scene for one and for Vin Diesel himself, still his best movie by far.Brian seeks out Dominic Torreto. 'He likes the tuna,' he says, at Toretto's restaurant but Brian lives a double life, and that role is quickly trying to find answers behind several truck hijackings before the truckers take the matters into their own hands.Furious retains this stylish edge that many films lose over time. I also remain impressed with the total conviction behind Johnny Tran's words by Rick Yune. The movie remains an excellent example towards timing and editing and let's never forget the beauty of the cars and engines themselves. Fast and the Furious is everything you would want from a racing movie.",7,1,2,16 October 2007
Quantum of Solace," Fresh evolution to the status quo.
","Bond is definitely back as Daniel Craig has settled into the role so perfectly well. Having not seen Casino Royale yet, much of the continuation from the first movie was fresh and new, but not hard enough to pick up for someone who is new to the current status quo. Past saying that, Quantum of Solace has lived up to the reputation that has become par for Bond. Espionage, action, car chases, beautiful women, international locales, etc. etc. And it's a good thing. Heaps of praise to the men and women responsible for the excellent action sequences and a witty dialogue, all of which compensated for an overly melodramatic score and plot. 'For Bond, this time it's personal!' Good grief! At least Olga Kurylenka is beautiful.Anyways, the movie is excellent, a must for fans of Bond and anyone who enjoys a good action film. Quantum of Solace will look nice whether at your theater or on your HD screen either way.",9,0,2,23 November 2008
The Butterfly Effect," Two Thumbs Up.
","You know, I liked 'The Butterfly Effect,' but I cannot fully explain why. Because of the original novel, the movie feels like a derivative measure through adding up to an audience who wouldn't understand it any other way. Add to the implausibility of some scenes, and this movie would simply stink. But the acting is good. Great and convincing in fact, with Kutcher pulling out all the stops. Sometimes you can tell when actors give it their best.A child is raised with blackouts during high stress moments and is asked by doctor and mother to record what happens through his diary. 13 years later, blackouts gone and working hard at University, Evan's actions in the past come back to haunt him. Through his newfound discovery and written diaries, he hopes to change all that.I particularly liked the idea behind 'The Butterfly Effect.' Chaos is tested in its utmost (and stretched) form. It works, even if the movie doesn't. Add to the acting of the movie (the child actors are just as good as the adults), and you have a solid production that works around a wonky script.",7,2,4,15 July 2004
Batman Begins," Incredible, more than what I expected.
","I was really in a hopeful mood when I went to see Batman Begins. I was measuring the movie, not against Schumacher's previous Bat-films, but by the Loeb/Lee 'Hush' storyline in the Batman comic books, simply because that comic story is better by far. This, I must say, is the the best Batman movie yet. It really blew my mind. There was character, depth ... they really did their best to figure out why of all things would a vigilante dress up as a bat and fight crime in a metropolis. Their effort shows. Warner may have pumped more into the marketing than they could have possibly done, but they have the quality movie to prove it. I myself have to say if there is one Batman movie you must see in your lifetime, this should be it.This is Batman, rewritten for modern times, and how he came to fight crime in Gotham City.Murphy does an excellent job as the Scarecrow. They pulled off the League of Shadows as well without it looking too much. Christian Bale is excellent. You can tell there was high hopes for this movie and I don't know how production did it but this is a Batman movie everyone will enjoy. And although Batman Begins is serious and dark, it's a movie where your money will be well spent since you know what you're getting. And of it, Batman Begins is that good.",10,7,11,18 June 2005
Before Sunset," Unexpected surprise.
","I've never heard of 'Before Sunrise' and I'm not a fan of romantic movies at all. But 'Before Sunset' was excellent. It's hard to explain but I recommend this movie to everyone. This is what would really happen after a fleeting romance. And they did it right, and they did it in the positive way. There could have been an awkwardness in the movie, or there could have been suppressed lust that would have flown out the gates. But we see real adults in these characters, and for once in a movie. Everyone involved with 'Before Sunset' did an excellent job.Set nine years after 'Before Sunrise,' Jesse and Celine meet each other again and catch up.An amazing thing about intimacy is that it never has to be physical. Throughout this movie, Jesse and Celine talk. The fact that they talk to each other so openly and honestly is where the intimacy lies. You don't have to see them hold hands, or hug, or touch each other every five minutes to see that they contain a certain intimacy between the two of them. They let themselves go by just being themselves, and we see that unfold when they converse about how they see the world and what they feel. This movie is an accomplishment and success in itself. It deserved its nomination for Best Screenplay at the Academy Awards and hopefully it will be a further success throughout the test of time.",8,0,1,28 February 2005
X-Men: The Last Stand," Very much beside myself as an X-Man fan.
","I love the X-Men, I grew up with them and have suffered through most of their story lines throughout the unforgiving nineties. So imagine my surprise at the unfolding storyline that is The Last Stand. If you were a fan of the X-Men, or loved the previous X-movies, you must watch this. I am no longer surprised at the hows or whys this movie made over $120 million in its opening weekend. The writers understood that there are far too many mutants and side-stories to count and keep track of. They cut to the bare-bones stuff and pulled no punches in the storyline. If you love the X-Men, this is must-watch stuff.Seeing his son suffer through his mutation, Warren II goes on a quest to find a cure for mutants. After several years, he succeeds but everyone is not so cheerful at this change. Meanwhile, Cyclops, while wallowing at the loss of his love from the last film, uncovers a secret so terrifying, everyone can feel it.All I can truly say about all the actors and actresses is that they did best they could in a film where there is so much to look at and marvel. I believed Ratner did the series justice and they inevitably had to follow the script the way they did. Kelsey Grammar did as good a job as the character of the Beast let him be. Even got his 'Stars and Garters' in. Fastball special? It's in here. As are Sentinels, Wolverine's quips, a male Marrow and the Juggernaut! X-Men III is an excellent piece of work, if not a little melodramatic. But oh well, I'm still floored by the power of the Dark Phoenix! Even Carrie would run the other way!",8,0,1,16 June 2006
Hellboy," Monsters are the real treat here.
","I would have never expected Hellboy to make the silver screen. There's something about the comic that never brought me toward it. But Guillermo del Toro has seen something I haven't, because the transition from comic to silver screen is exceptional. The film is very plot-driven, one scene moving to another at a faster-than-usual pace, but the real gift of Hellboy is the ingenuity and effort used in creating the monsters. Sammael and Kroenen are crafted with much care and I found it an absolute shame there wasn't more monsters to work with in a limited time.Much of Hellboy feels underused. Liz is not used as much as I hoped, and Abe Sapien is out of commission about halfway through. Dr. Manning's fate wasn't fully settled on either and abilities used by Hellboy, like reviving the dead, are kind of just left out there, like who knew? But for a comic book film, with no expectations at that, Hellboy is a pleasant surprise, save for the fact that there should have been more monsters! This is Guillermo del Toro we're talking about!",5,1,1,5 July 2008
Ghostbusters," Two Thumbs Up.
","One of the best movies of the Eighties, Ghost Busters is one of those must watch movies. The special effects may be dated now, but the conviction and comedy of the actors are still very much up to par with today. One of Bill Murray's best and most certainly Reitman's finest. A definite well done job.After getting kicked off campus, three professors sell the house of one of their to get the money to become 'paranormal investigations and exterminations!'Ghost Busters has not really stood the test of time as many other classics have. What once was original has now been beaten down by so many imitators that it is hard to give credit where it is due. We take it for granted essentially but it's all good. Ghost Busters still gets a thumbs up.",7,2,2,11 July 2004
Hero," Beautiful.
","In all honesty, Hero required a bit more patience than I thought. Tarantino wanted to present this movie to North American audiences so I thought there would have been more action, but surprise! There is much drama in Hero and the movie begins with one intention and unfolds, in a deceptively beautiful fashion, into a legend that is much larger than the characters themselves are involved! Why did it have to take so long to prove such a point?Anyway, a man who shall remain Nameless has dispatched the kingdom's three top assassins, thus easing the King's mind that he could sleep at night. But the King is curious and we see the true story and how the tale unfolds.The fights are beautiful. The battle between Snow and Moon, though lopsided, was a joy. It was art in itself. But overall, be patient. With the many changes in the story, I lost my concentration adjusting to it. But any fan of martial arts and drama must see this movie. It is that elegant.",7,80,149,13 December 2004
K-19: The Widowmaker," Well scripted dramatization.
","Here we have a well-told story, complete with star-studded cast, telling from a perspective we usually don't see much of: the Soviet side in the Cold War. That in itself makes for an interesting movie as we see Ford, Neeson, Sarsgaard, even Joss Ackland work out their Russian accents to the best of their ability. But the script makes the most of all the cast as we relive the story of K-19 and how we learn of heroes that never were to be.It's 1961 and a Soviet nuclear submarine, rushed off before it's sea-ready, is sent on a test-firing mission.Two conflicts take front and center stage that make for this good movie. One is the clever use of 'good cop-bad cop,' as the former Captain (Neeson) is always at odds with the constant drill-testing from the newer Captain (Ford). Secondly is the suspenseful radiation leaking that takes over the submarine and its crew as the doctor is forced to tell everyone they're doing fine in one of the movies finer, yet terrifying, moments. The movie is longer than it could be, but not as long as some others of the same genre. If you enjoy a good drama tied to real events, K-19 would not disappoint.",8,6,9,3 September 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Underachieving.
","It was great to see the Fantastic Four and Alicia again. It was a different, better experience this time around, as the Fantasti-car makes its first theater appearance and Dr. Doom returns, even if certain scenes have him looking a little like Emperor Palpatine. It was great to see the Silver Surfer himself, but the film as a whole, sadly did not make much use of all the characters involved. Galactus may have had less than 10 minutes screen-time!A white comet hurtles around the Earth creating craters and causing all sorts of havoc throughout the globe. While Sue and Reed avoid the public eye and ensuing chaos to get married, their dodging tactics and inner turmoil within the group prove all for naught when that very comet crashes the fun. Back in Latveria, Dr. Doom lives and seeks the comet, a Silver Surfer, for his own intent.There's plenty of excitement and action across the globe as the Fantastic Four save lives and duke things out in locales such as London and China. I was also impressed with the Fantasti-Car and with certain special effects, like General Hager's fate and Galactus. The Silver Surfer himself wasn't too bad either, so I hope they use him better the next time around, such as Dr. Doom. The ruler of Latveria certainly came back with a bang for the sequel. Since Galactus did appear though, I hoped they would have used better screen time for one of comics' greatest villains.",4,0,1,29 October 2007
Transformers," Fans of the series rejoice!
","Ever since Steven Spielberg attached his name to the project many moons ago, I followed the movie's progress with a passion ever since. And seeing children in the theater, who were my age when the cartoon was airing new episodes every day after school, brought memories of a time when I thought there would have been nothing cooler on Earth than seeing a live-action version of the Transformers on the silver screen. Thankfully, the movie did not disappoint, for though many spots throughout the film were overly cheesy or flimsy, the essence of the Transformers remained strong from beginning to end. Any fanboy would take immense pleasure analyzing this film from front to back.An opening introduction to Energon... err, AllSpark, leads us to two stories. The first is of a helicopter, thought downed in Afghanistan, reappears on a U.S. Army base in Qatar, transforms into a giant robot and attacks, trying to steal all the United States' defense hard-drive. The second is of Sam Witwicky, who after buying a car with his father, finds that it also could be more than meets the eye.What made the Transformers great is all present and accounted for: the exceptional voice over work, the smooth transforming of the Transformers, and the unbelievable wit and hilarious one-liners of the Transformers themselves. There's nothing funnier than Megatron's reaction when he's lying next to a human, or Barricade's interrogation of Sam when he's caught, OR the cop's questioning of Sam at the precinct ('Take some Mojo, huh?'). Some of the overlong script's wit wanders a little though when it's all decided, including a Captain of the U.S. army, that taking the AllSpark, hence, the Autobot/Decepticon battle royale, into the CITY was a good bet, where millions of terrified humans would run for their lives and get stepped on. But some of the Tranformers' best episodes are also explored as well, such as why the Autobots even bother to help the humans with groups like Sector 7 around to annoy them. It's another overblown blockbuster, sure, but this film has a loyal fanbase to embrace what was an excellent transition from cartoon to film. Many thanks to Bay and Spielberg.",7,0,1,20 August 2007
Shrek 2," Disappointing
","Shrek 2's hype does not change the fact that the sequel is not on par with the original. Thankfully, all the actors made their return and the new characters joining the movie are entertaining. The sequel's special effects are much more stand out, with the people looking less rigid and Fiona, more fair. But aside from these factors, Shrek 2 looks like it could have been made for a straight-for-video release.Shrek and Fiona are living happily ever after. That changes when Shrek has to meet his in-laws, Far, Far Away.What's missing in Shrek 2 is that the first movie had more wit, character and drive. Shrek 2 is a respectable add-on lacking in action, driven by story and its own references. Audiences will no doubt enjoy, but like Myers' Austin Powers sequels, the expectation to deliver good should have been better.",6,0,0,1 June 2004
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Well done performances all around.
","Burton's Charlie definitely strays from the book and the original 70s Willy Wonka, but the casting and superb effort all around add to the intrigue of the movie. This version is much more modern, more hip and more sympathetic to the characters overall. The fates of the children are revealed here as opposed to the original where you could only imagine the worst. Depp's performance as Willy Wonka moves away from Gene Wilder's Mad Hatter persona and we get to see more of the chocolate maker and why he is who he is.Willy Wonka, world renowned chocolate manufacturer, holds a contest allowing five children to enter his secret factory, with his intentions being his own business.The original Willy Wonka is a light-hearted musical. While this Charlie has songs, it's kind of hard to beat Sammy Davis Jr.'s Candy Man or the original Oompa Loompa songs. I refuse to discredit this version too much. In this Charlie, the children's punishments are more just and Willy Wonka is given a full origin. Charlie's father's alive in this one so the family's situation isn't as dire. The fate of the Buckets are revealed here where it was anyone's guess what happens after in the first Willy. I'm confident everyone will enjoy this movie and fans of the original will be just as satisfied. In these eyes, it was an all star cast that put on a good show.",8,2,3,31 October 2005
2001: A Space Odyssey," One of the best.
","Can you find another film where the music complements the movie so splendidly? How about using the strength of sound to tell the story, whether it be Poole's breathing or HAL cutting off the life support of the survey crew? Will another scene ever top, let alone challenge, Kubrick's vision of The Dawn of Man? 2001 has everything going for it. Even more so now that we can look back at this movie forty years later and can comparatively draw our own conclusions on how we have succeeded and failed, this movie kind of being its own measuring stick on how well we have advanced and changed.Three main stories make up 2001. We begin with The Dawn of Man, where humans earliest ancestors are trying to survive on the young planet. We skip to 2001 where business and exploration is part of life in space, and a new discovery is found on the moon. Finally, a mission to Jupiter is underway with a hibernating survey team, two astronauts and HAL 9000.One of the best conflicts of all time is obviously between Bowman and HAL. From when Bowman uses the now-infamous line, 'Open the pod bay doors, HAL,' to when he goes straight to HAL's Logic Memory Center, the conversation is sharper than most movies I can currently recall. The length of the film is always something to be desired, but I still watch this movie, never really tiring of it. How the Space Station moves to the music like a ferris wheel, not to mention the ever alien presence of the Monolith, there'll never come a time when something new fascinates me from 2001.",9,0,2,14 August 2007
Avatar," Cameron aims for the knockout.
","$230-300 million later, James Cameron wanted to make the kind of movie he wanted to make... and it worked. Kids were leaving the prior screening to mine saying, 'It was awesome!' Adults walked out of this theatre saying it was amazing. The guy beside me right now on the bus is telling his friends over his cell how incredible and really good the film is and he will see it again with them tonight after shopping. Steven Spielberg saw a viewing and said he hadn't felt this way since Star Wars. And in many ways, they're right. Watch the movie in 3D. It is a visual treat.To dispense of the one standout flaw, the melodramatics and the acting, you have to really ask yourself, is all the really good action movies about the acting? Avatar succeeds because the plot is not as ridiculous as 2012 or Revenge of the Fallen. We can suspend belief because the film is not overly ridiculous, even with the 'indigenous' blue aliens. The only thing that had me scratching my head was having to buy the fact that Pandora, with the twigs, trees, glowing grass and creatures is one giant Facebook and that Aiwa is the Internet connection between them all. But if that is a complaint, I really have nothing to base it on because this is vintage James Cameron.The theme is man vs nature and man is the bad guy. There is an image shot of the main bad guy in a mechsuit when a helicopter goes down behind him that is vintage Cameron. It shows the destructive nature of man and here he is. But that image is a footnote compared to the planet Pandora. The planet is very much full of life and leave it to the King of the Friggin' World, James Cameron, to be man enough to invent technologies and anything else he desired to realize his vision. That alone is reason enough to believe this movie will stun theatregoers. It really cannot be watched at home. Get the 3D glasses and experience it at the theatre.",9,4,10,19 December 2009
The Da Vinci Code," Faithful adaptation of the book.
","It was amazing, really, the reaction to the Da Vinci Code. Never, in a megaplex, have I seen a sell-out crowd of teens, adults and seniors all mingled together in a stuffy theater. Not since Titanic. Reeling in at two and a half hours, Da Vinci Code feels like a long movie. However, if you read the book, you will not be disappointed. The movie moves as fast as the novel and is as faithful as an adaptation will get. The cast is right on cue with its characters and Ron Howard did not stray into any creative freedom to ruin the movie.The curator to the Louvre is murdered, and the French silently accuse one Robert Langdon, an American professor of religious symbols. It's up to Langdon and an officer who believes his innocence to unlock the clues of the murder.About the protests and hunger strikes that surround the movie, my advice is to relax. Throughout the movie, the characters themselves say that some of the secrets and stories about the Catholic church is fictional itself. And in some scenes (particularly the one where Sophie's secret is revealed), the ideas are so far from left field that, oddly, I found myself the only one in the theater laughing. The Da Vinci Code is pure fiction. The entire movie is melodramatic, with Zimmer's musical score blaring that whole point. But if you loved the book, you'll love the movie and I recommend you to watch it.",5,2,4,21 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The best Potter yet.
","Everyone, this is the best Harry Potter yet. Everything you want, there's more of. You have to be focused to understand some of the narrative, but it all pays off. The Goblet of Fire is easily the most intense and most involving of all the films yet and I, personally, do not envy the director of the next film. What makes this film greater than the others is that Harry tackles everything in this film. From his friends, to relationships, and to his greatest fears, Harry's screwed at from all sides. I would be surprised if you, as a Harry Potter fan, did not enjoy this excellent film.We begin at the Weasley's home, where Harry and his adopted family go to the World Cup of Qudditch where everyone's greatest fears are soon to be realized.From the beginning, you notice this film is much more British than the rest of the series. I love how they handled the World Cup, the Tri-Wizard Tounament, the Yule Ball and the return of Harry's greatest foe. Everything is realistic and near exceptional. Excellent job on the parts of 'MadEye' Moody and Voldemort. After four films, the series has not had one let-down yet. By all means, you must watch this movie. I look forward to the next.",9,1,3,19 November 2005
The Happening," A return to form somewhat for Shyamalan.
","Poor Shyamalan hasn't had a break in a long time. The novelty in his quirky scriptwriting/direction skills wore off many moons ago and his career took a direct hit with Lady in the Water. But The Happening isn't Lady in the Water. Heck, it's not even The Village, thankfully. Shyamalan has taken this movie straight back to when his films worked. But two consecutive critically panned movies later, would Shyamalan go for the home run? The trailer would have you think that.Like Signs, we find out what's 'Happening' pretty quick throughout the north-eastern U.S. as another doomsday scenario is dealt with. And continuing off of Signs, the science fiction is mostly brushed aside to deal with characters and conflict. But these batch of characters are mostly lame ducks, with Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel not at their best by a long shot. The script is questionable at best and the overall premise for drama and tension ('Run from the wind!') for the film is, again, lame. The film is not bad, but it's not great either. I think the novelty of Shyamalan films have worn off as a whole, but at least if this film is an indication, he has returned to form somewhat.",5,3,7,18 June 2008
A Beautiful Mind," An important film...
","Deep down, I feel that the topic of mental illness is a touchy and hard topic to cover for Hollywood. In regards to schizophrenia, A Beautiful Mind is currently, and by far, the best story in order to remotely comprehend what a family endures and overcomes when a member of their family is stricken with the illness. The story of John Nash is an intriguing one at the least.Taking an idea from Adam Smith one step further, Princeton mathematician John Nash revolutionizes economics and lands a job at M.I.T. The Pentagon also hires him to crack codes against the Communists.The movie takes its time picking up, as we get to know the anti-social Nash and his lifestyle. When the symptoms of an illness become apparent, we haven't seen the worst by far. There is no action or danger that would draw you into A Beautiful Mind. On the contrary, this movie is the dramatic story of an economic genius whom we get to know. Incredibly, his genius constantly struggles with madness everyday.",7,0,2,16 October 2007
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Action/comedy hits the right buttons.
","In many parts of the movie, you have to suspend belief if you are to enjoy Mr. and Mrs. Smith. It opens with a comedy sketch and tries to loosen you up to its reality, that a husband and wife, for half a decade or more, can keep the secret from each other, that both of them kill people for a living. That wouldn't be much of a stretch, but of course, it's a 'blockbuster' movie, with a large budget and an 'all-star' cast. This has been a better movie for both Pitt and Jolie in some time though.A couple meet in Bagota, Columbia, of all timing and places, just when they need each other and decide to quicken things and get married. Little does the either know they are assassins and are about to get caught in a sticky situation.There is no sex in the movie. I walked into the theater thinking that something would happen that prompted all of these silly headlines as of late, thinking the media knew something I didn't. Absolutely nothing worth mentioning folks. As an entertaining comedy, I think it works but nothing else beyond that. You know, if you have the technology at home to enjoy the sound and explosions, I suggest a rental. I could have lived with that and so can you.",7,0,3,20 June 2005
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Speechless
","Wow... as a childhood fan of Transformers, I'm really without comment. Maybe it's easier to tell you what I saw and you can judge for yourself but SPOILERS ARE EVERYWHERE so if you care like I once did, skip to other User Comments, read the critics who actually get paid or, if you want to, see the darn movie yourself. For a Transformers movie, there was a helluva lot more actors than robots, especially this being a sequel there should have been more of everything. I laughed once during the whole movie and it had nothing to do with robots humping, dogs humping, strategically placed wrecking balls or brownies. The big explosion you read of in trivia is not a robot blowing up. Another thing I saw is that the same writers also wrote this year's hit reboot Star Trek also wrote this film, believe it or not. I think what really left me speechless though was both Devastator and the Fallen (supposedly the first Decepticon) both died like punks, instead of some awesome fight. And instead of throwing in some saving grace at the end credits, maybe a coming of Unicron to justify why I sat down for a minute shy of 150 I get... nothing. No end credit clip. Optimus saves the day, that's a wrap. The guys beside me fell asleep during the fight scenes for Christ's sake and so did someone's girlfriend in front... So yeah. Revenge of the Fallen? Nero put up a much better fight in Star Trek. And if Unicron doesn't arrive to eat Earth and not have a pathetic death like Megatron's 'master' after this, Transformers should be graciously laid to rest. Right now.",3,6,15,24 June 2009
The Holiday," Holiday film for a holiday couple.
","I was surprised with The Holiday. I find many romantic comedies, be they seasonal or not, to contain a smarmy attitude, but The Holiday is humble. The movie is conventional and unoriginal, yes, but it's the attitude and the characters we truly fall for on the screen, and Ms. Meyers seems to know a good full lot on how relationships work and the type of people who would relate, not to mention the kind of actors who would portray them. And, thank the heavens, there is no overly melodramatic scenes in this movie at all. None. What you see is what you get, and it's a decent romantic film that can cater to couples around the Christmas holiday.What makes these couples strong in this film isn't just learning to overcome themselves, but their environment helps them do it. Scene-steelers like Graham's kids and Arthur, I find, created the glue to making the film stick together. Let them have the scenes we say, because the rest of the movie involves finding love and discovering that friendship that creates that relationship we all look for in the first place. It's a good film, never overly serious, and understanding in its audience, and I would recommend it among the many stacks of holiday movies you can enjoy along the weekend.",5,1,2,25 March 2007
Love Actually," Disappointing.
","It has been too long since I have seen an overlong display of sap, drowning over every heart the world over. 'Love Actually' will work at every chance it has to get you drawn in, with several stories from a large cast hoping that one of them will make you feel for the movie. It's all fluff really, and the cramming in of all the stories create one indifferent movie, with no time to really care about most of the characters.The stories of several couples and their love are told around Christmas time.For a romantic comedy, there is very little of the latter. Because of the length of 'Love Actually,' next to none of the charm works! It's boring and drives home its only point, that love is all around, so many times that you might as well take the film, throw it in the fridge, let it age and serve it at your next cocktail party with the red wine. Be prepared for a mind-numbing experience, with little chuckles.",4,1,2,10 June 2004
Wedding Crashers," Crashing a comedy genre.
","Warning: Vaughn talks fast in this movie. Other warnings I should mention about: the movie isn't that funny until we see Gloria and Claire. The jokes are few and far between. The Rules of Wedding Crashing that you see in the Trivia page for this movie are irrelevant. The story, mind you, holds up and for 2005, it does stand unchallenged for the adult comedy of that year.Two divorce mediators have an interesting hobby. They crash weddings to bed the bridesmaids. Inevitably, one falls in love for his prey.What kind of a name is Sack anyway? You will laugh at least one point in the movie. Currently, I believe it's Vince Vaughn's best work to date. Rachel McAdams is continually proving herself to be Hollywood's 'It' Girl with another great performance in yet another movie she doesn't have to try so hard in. How Wedding Crashers became the summer's surprise hit, we'll never know but it will entertain you nevertheless.",5,0,0,21 January 2006
Hancock," The second half ruins everything.
","The first half of Hancock was better than what I could have expected. Hancock is a homeless superhero with no respect whatsoever. The opening act has him stop an armed chase with a price tag of $7 million dollars in property damage. He destroys pavement wherever he lands. Everyone, from kids to criminals, call him an a-hole. Then the film gets surprisingly better. He saves the life of Ray, someone skilled but flawed at public relations and convinces Hancock to improve his image, by answering the demands of the public to answer for all his crimes, apologize and turn himself in. From this point, it all goes downhill from here, and it's the second half twist and ending that stinks up the whole movie, to the point where you don't care about how good the first half was anymore. How could they have screwed up such a good premise? Hancock's origin and weakness, though I will not spoil, are the mother of all cop-outs.It's not as if Hancock shows any Achilles heel in Will Smith or Charlize Theron's acting abilities. The second half of the film is that bad if an Academy Award winning actress who worked with Will before cannot pull it through. Throw in a pathetic stinker of a villain, a story of love and tortured relationships and Hancock is crushed by the weight of too many generic superhero clichés.",3,6,13,5 July 2008
Hitch," Cruelty to good guys.
","Hitch is a good movie. Will Smith carries the movie from reel to reel and you cannot picture anyone else to fill this role. Hitch was born solely by Will Smith. I think that explains the producer credit. And I also think that, on a personal level, Eva Mendes was chosen to play a character similar to that of Jada Pinkett-Smith. Throughout the movie, Alex trips himself all over Sara, and she responds, mildly, with amusement, but mostly with cruelty and during the rest of the show, you wonder why Hitch is doing this to himself.Hitch is the go-to guy, the 'date doctor' if you will, for nice guys wanting to get together with the women they fancy. But Hitch has his work cut out for him in Albert Brenaman, a junior tax assistant, who fancies his employer, a supermodel.Thank goodness for Kevin James. His character Albert, is the perfect choice (personally chosen by Smith, again) as a character who needs plenty of Hitch's help. He carries the film along with Smith. In the end, Hitch, is a good romance/comedy and I recommend it to any couple who can't find that perfect rental they can't settle on.",7,1,1,18 June 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Passion of the Lucas
","George Lucas had to deliver this time. And delivered it well, he has. Episode III is the bridging between the twenty some-odd years off a dynasty that has defined a generation. It brings in those viewers now who grew up knowing that generation. Towards the end of Episode III, the chaos brings about the identity we all know and love. The music. The style. Darth Vader. And the 'New Hope.' Sure, it's havoc to watch. But after the first two prequels, I was kind of hoping that's what I would get.War between the Republic and the Separatists go all out as Obi-Wan and Anakin set out to save Chancellor Palpatine, who has been captured by Count Dooku.Many comments I've read bash the acting and dialog in the film. For that, I have to say, 'Give me a break.' Seriously, who watches Star Wars for moving dialog? And no one watched Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher for show stopping performances. The real point of Episode III is to see how Darth Vader becomes the person we have always known him as. That scene, you can tell Lucas has had in his head for quite some time now, because it captures the campness that defined the first trilogy. If you've seen the first trilogy, by all means watch Revenge of the Sith. Trust me, this is the one you wanted to see when The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones came out. And if you ONLY happened to see those two, give yourself a time out and take a break from this one. Chances are, you will see the same nonsense that made you long for the exit during those seatings. Overall, I thought it was great. It was a defining moment for our culture, and I enjoyed the completion of it. May the Force be with you all.",7,1,3,26 May 2005
1408," A conflict for the ages: man vs hotel room
","Before I say anything about the film, I have to compliment the performance of John Cusack here. From that little crony in Sixteen Candles, Cusack's come a long way in mastering an expressive, manic persona that fits the bill perfectly for 1408. As for the movie itself, 1408 is a stylish thriller that's strong in delivery but weak in substance. Sure the room is evil and plays mind games, but its boogie tactics evolve from the clever to the outright ludicrous. How you could taunt a man with Karen Carpenter's voice in one scene and later have him flee from a corpse in an air duct in another is beyond me but there you see it.Novelist Mike Enslin stays overnight in hotels and inns and writes of their horror stories. When he receives a postcard to not check into a room in New York, his further investigation shows it's too good of an offer to pass up.As with other King movies, pay attention to the little scenes at the beginning that may seem pointless but later add up. The room plays all sorts of games from physical to downright emotional and there's no greater tool that it uses to me than its clock. But eventually it uses the phone, the window, the walls and even the fire escape route map to break Michael Enslin even further down. But there is still no funnier scene than Cusack being chased down by a zombie or something in an air duct. What were they thinking? Anyhow, the movie is still an OK psychological thriller once you suspend your disbelief in knowing the antagonist is an evil hotel room. Jackson and Cusack can't get much better in their skills as they themselves convince you that something is terribly wrong in room 1408.",4,0,1,28 October 2007
Iron Man," Surprise, surprise.
","I scoffed at the idea of this film being made initially. Having not-so-fond memories of 1990's Captain America and 2004 and 1989's The Punisher will make you wary of any Marvel movie but surprise, surprise. Iron Man is actually a decent film, and Marvel's lofty goals of a possible Avengers film look plausible if this good effort is a sign of things to come.Robert Downey Jr. was a natural pick for the role, and surprisingly Jeff Bridges had a pull-out-the-stops performance for his role as Obadiah Stane. The movie is full-of-wit, humor and character. Comic book characters such as Tony Stark and Pepper Potts seem to be more real on the silver screen than real life persons being portrayed and I think that's where the real cinch is here. Somehow, past the science fiction and action, we can still identify with these characters, albeit in a humorous way if any, that we can enjoy the film. Because once we return to the action the film doesn't hold up well anymore on its own, particularly during the final fight between Stane and Stark. Nevertheless the film ended on the best note yet, for all movies that lead into sequels, and a valuable lesson is learned for myself that you shouldn't judge a movie by its poster or genre all the time.",7,1,2,16 June 2008
A Night at the Roxbury," The soundtrack is what you want.
","Following such spin-offs such as Stuart Saves His Family and It's Pat, it would be understandable enough if the next Saturday Night Live feature would have been responsible for the largest mass suicide in modern history. Thankfully, Roxbury is a feature that comes off at only below-standard. Which is a good thing, really. Will Ferrell would move on to better things, and the soundtrack is impressive enough for a good 90s flashback.Brothers Steve and Doug contend with family and their own problems while trying to get into the Roxbury, all the while dreaming of starting their own outdoor nightclub.There's one thing you can do, really, to say you've enjoyed the movie. Fast forward to the club dance scene where they all start dancing. It's the best part in Roxbury, with the choreography and the club beat. Otherwise, the rest of the film is pure torture as the brothers fight with their father, and themselves, to realize something that wouldn't even happen in the movies if it wasn't a Saturday Night Live skit. I suggest the soundtrack, and only that to save you your time.",3,1,6,20 June 2005
300," Making history look cool.
","I was actually fascinated with the visual effect created by 300. Portraying Spartans as fearless, free, supermen, Frank Miller has one large imagination that so far has suited the green, uh, silver screen very well. Of course, plenty of blood and gore litter this over-stylized Battle of Thermopylae, but Miller's imagination is not without some fantastic views on Xerxes, his Immortals, the traitor Ephialtes, the Ephors and the Oracle among others.A messenger convoy from Persia to Sparta brings word that their king Xerxes comes for earth and water. The king doesn't buy it, or any doomsday prophecies for that matter, and enlists the best 300 soldiers to meet up with other Greeks to confront with Xerxes at the 'Hot Gates.'300 could appeal to any inner comic book fan. Comic books have always had a faithful following in movies and 300 is an easy example as to why the genre will continue to remain strong. Making history look sharp and cool, no matter how silly the script, props or choreography, will sell. The impressive post-production made an entire film set on a green screen backdrop into a rugged, dark and gory terrain. That in itself deserves notice.",4,0,1,9 October 2007
Fantastic Four," I wanted to get into it.
","There's a scene when you see Dr. Doom in full comic book attire that captured my interest. Here he was, one of comic's greatest villains on the movie screen, about to kick butt. That gave Doom some justice. The rest of the movie will not be so kind to you. Throughout your time, the Fantastic Four will complain and talk through most of the movie. They spend more time fighting amongst each other and themselves that it's a wonder that Doom doesn't tear them apart when they finally go mano-a-mano. So the movie totally sucks on all fours. At least it'll stay as true as it gets for fans.Bankrupt scientist Richards, and his friend Grimm, seeks the help of one Victor Von Doom to finance a project on how cosmic rays affect living material. The three of them, along with Sue and Johnny Storm, take a trip to a space station for some tests, but when they accidentally become the experiment themselves, one of them becomes evil, yet the others become 'Fantastic!' as the tag line goes.I felt like the anticipation of the Fantastic Four to be on screen was a huge let-down. Like the Super Mario Bros. movie, it was a huge franchise, with the potential to become a blockbuster, completely wasted. There is no plot to the movie. You are literally forced to believe that Doom, after seeking earlier revenge, goes maniacal on his own accord, throws out common sense and takes his frustrations out on the Fantastic Four? The movie lacks much story and even more common sense, but if you are a comic book fan, by all means, enjoy the movie and draw your own conclusions.",2,4,9,10 July 2005
Sin City," Art come to life.
","If there is one reason only to watch this movie, never mind the exceptional acting chops, the spot-on storyboard, and anything else you can think of, Sin City is, without a doubt, one of the most visually impressive movies of all time. There has been never been a movie like this where the comic art form has been brought so close to life in all its shape or form. Sin City brings true originality in its medium.A few short stories, based on Frank Miller's Sin City comic, are brought to life on the big screen.Being brought to film, for this comic book, is like bringing life to this world. How color is so brilliantly used, from Becky's eyes to Goldie's hair. Or the silhouette shading, cleverly used on Becky's crosses or when Dwight's drowning in the tar pits. Never mind that the scripting and stories themselves hold their own in this visual masterpiece. Rodriguez knew the timing was right to make a movie of this caliper and, thank the masses, Sin City has helped usher in a new dimension, an undiscovered country if you will, for bringing art from print to film.",7,0,1,5 September 2007
Gladiator," Extremely entertaining.
","Bringing back the epic genre, Gladiator makes the classics Ben-Hur and Spartacus proud by recreating the wonder, grit and feel of being in Ancient Rome. An exceptional effort was done by all involved. The costumes, the cinematography, the choreography, even the music itself, Gladiator is deserving in all of its awards and nominations received. Let us not forget the actors themselves. Truly, Gladiator is one film that will stand the test of time for many years to come.General Maximus helps Marcus Aurelius keep Germania under check, but who will do the same for Rome in the case of the Caesar's death? Marcus doesn't think his son, Commodus will do any good in charge. 'No morals,' the Caesar claims, but Commodus thinks of himself as merciful, by killing his father, Maximus' family and intimidating the Senate. Maximus survives his own assassination attempt and swears to right wrong and get revenge.Some of the best action sequences are seen in Gladiator. A couple of those are the first fights in the Colosseum. Joaquin Phoenix does an outstanding job himself playing the villain Commodus. The scenes with him and Lucius are some of the more terrifying I've seen, particularly since Ridley Scott does a good job portraying their bond from Lucilla's perspective. Proximo stated to Maximus that he had to win the crowd, and surely by doing that, he won movie-goers as well, as this will remain one of Russell Crowe's finest performances. Epic, blockbuster and critically acclaimed, Gladiator had earned its Academy Award for Best Picture, and then some.",8,1,2,17 October 2007
Shark Tale," Something was missing.
","I can't explain why I didn't like Shark Tale too much. Visually there is a creative backdrop which is absolutely beautiful. I wonder if they just took pictures of New York, doused it underwater and worked around the scenery. Because with the exception of that imagery, Shark Tale has a very loud, very brash, in-your-face mentality that takes away from the movie. Other features like The Little Mermaid and Finding Nemo invite you to the paradise of being under the sea. Shark Tale throws you in the middle of the loudest club and tells you to get down on it. I don't buy it and with the exception of some visual gags, nobody else could neither. This is also another movie where Will Smith can get back into his Fresh Prince gear and get away with it and Jack Black could play a gender confused shark and be accepted for it as well. I wanted to enjoy the scenery and the sight of an underground New York. Shark Tale offered it but instead beat us silly with all the hoopla we see everyday on the television set. What a disappointment. Enjoy the humor and expect nothing more.",4,64,106,14 November 2004
Cinderella Man," One of the better movies.
","Cinderella Man will be one of the most underrated films of all time. Because most audiences will associate Ron Howard, Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti with other, perhaps, through perspective, more successful films. But the story of James J. Braddock was a brilliant choice to base upon and the movie is by far one of the best for the year. As far as inspirational stories go, Cinderella Man is among the best.The story of boxer James J. Braddock and his fall from heavyweight championship contention, plagued by injuries and the Great Depression. His comeback story gives him a true title of the term, Cinderella Man.Set in Depression-era New York makes the city an interesting side-story in itself. We see the enormity of Central Park's Hooverville, husbands just giving up, the line-ups for emergency relief. And with Braddock, we see the story of a man who not only refuses to back down on his career, but maintains his already strong integrity by never giving up on his family and country. Ron Howard ensures the film remains crisp and sharp, and Cinderella Man holds excellent build-up right to the very end where Braddock faces Max Baer. An excellent movie, Cinderella Man would be a worthy addition to your movie library.",9,1,1,27 October 2007
Beetlejuice," Sleeper hit.
","Tim Burton could do no wrong after risking twice, first to make this movie and secondly, casting Michael Keaton in this most unlikely role. Beetle Juice is a sleeper hit, fast approaching 20 years since its release and not really straying much from quality from when audiences first viewed it. I've seen this movie half a dozen since its release and its never become old yet. To sum it all up, if you're looking for a ghouly comic film with a bit of lighthearted fun and all around creativity, take this review to heart and rent this for Halloween.After moving in, the Maitlands, Adam and Barbara meet a tragic end and receive a handbook and guide to haunting their house. When their amateur efforts prove only to attract the new owners' curious daughter, they are tempted by a 'bio-exorcist' who is nothing but bad news.Burton was given an all star cast to work with in Beetle Juice and the creativity that came from this movie was to be the standard that we expect now from all of Tim's films. But there just isn't enough to work with in a 92 minute film. Sandworms, the world of the dead, Beetle Juice himself aren't nearly as explained enough as they would be in this day and age of information. Beetle Juice needed a sequel, though the cartoon series was just as good a fun hit as the original.",6,2,6,31 October 2005
