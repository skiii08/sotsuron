10 Cloverfield Lane," Who is the real monster ..?
","First of all, this is NOT a Cloverfield sequel, but it's way better ! Furthermore, 10 Cloverfield Lane a story that has a perfect runtime (1h43) â€“ no moments are uninteresting or boring, and there is no predictable moments. At no points it slow down or lose interest. For a 5 million budget, this shows that the success of a movie, is not made by explosion or a lot of special effects, its made by a good well written story, intense, and good actors as well. The dialogue is really good, also due to fantastic execution from its cast.J.J. Abrams Produce it, and did a clever move to name it 10 Cloverfield Lane, Dan Trachtenberg directed it, and for his first official movie, we can be certain that we will hear his name again.The three man cast - Mary Elizabeth Winstead, John Gallagher Jr. and the one and only John Goodman,in what may just be one of his finest performances in more recent years, Goodman did an amazing performance that I hope will be recognize by the Academy Award next year. The two other were good as well, and deserve to be notice. The only thing I like less was maybe the end, like the 15 last minutes of the movie, but its still a great movie nonethelessAll in all, it has an intriguing premise, brilliant performances and good storyline. It puts you on the edge of your seat for all the movie. Good Thriller, Drama, mystery and sci-fi. I strongly suggest you to watch this movie. Buying it at full price won't make you disappointed !!",7,0,1,17 September 2016
Ready Player One," Going Outside is Highly Overrated
","Steven Spielberg still has it! If you are looking for an original, entertaining and just plain fun movie with a lot of reference from the 80s, go ahead and buy this movie. The only real downside i had with the movie was the character development ... The Ready Player One Soundtrack from Alan Silvestri is beautiful and a nice throwback.If you liked the movie go ahead and try the book, its different in a lot of ways! It was a blast seeing everything i imagined, characters, world building etc, coming to life! The motion capture was really amazing. For book readers and lovers I will leave this quote from the beginning of the book: 'Dozens of books, cartoons, movies, and miniseries have attempted to tell the story of everything that happened next, but every single one of them got it wrong. So I want to set the record straight, once and for all.' - In other words, see it as an extension of the book, another way to tell the story from the eyes of other people.",8,5,10,11 April 2018
Room," The beauty of the world
","Room is a Wonderful movie based on the book by Emma Donoghue. First of all, you should avoid watching the trailer of this movie if you really want to experience the movie as it should be.The story takes place within ''Room'' , a confined space with only a single skylight for daylight. The condition of the room is bad, it looks all dirty and not sane at all. You can quickly see what's going on, within the first minutes of this original Drama film. I don't want to say too much, because you just need to experience it yourself during the viewing, and you will quickly understand what's going on. It made me cry, it made me smile, it made me have a hell of a good time, that's for sure and also, it made my heart beat so fast during some scenes, and really care about this kid and his mom.The acting is superb.Brie Larson (Ma) delivers one of the best performance as an actress, if not the best, for this year. Jacob Tremblay (Jack) is one of the finest young actor I have ever seen in a movie. Normally, young actors bother me, but this young man did a really good job. The movie deserves the Oscar nominations, as Brie Larson.All in all, i strongly recommend you to buy this movie at full price if you are looking for a good drama movie.

Snowden," Safety of Freedom ..?
","From Director Oliver Stone, this Biography shows and explain the life of Edward Snowden. Part thriller and part drama, it's a movie that, not only keeps you engaged in the movie, but also makes you think about all sort of questions. As you could know, Oliver Stone will lean more on representing Snowden as a Hero, but not in a way that judges those who, at the end, still think of him as a traitor.Joseph-Gordon Levitt did an Oscar worthy performance as he portrays Snowden perfectly, from the physical side (his voice included) to the psychological side. Shailene Woodley gives a mature performance worth noticing as she portrays Lindsay Mills, and had great chemistry with JGL. All of the rest of the cast were good too (Quinto, Ifans, etc.)I strongly suggest you to watch Citizenfour to fully capture what happened to this modern hero (imo)If you liked Oliver Stones previous movies, or you want to discover Edward Snowden, this is a great movie for you ! Will buy it on blu- ray for sure !",7,7,17,17 September 2016
Black Panther," The king of Marvel Universe ..?
","The movie itself is fine, well-made, but nothing out of the ordinary. Marvel fans will love this one, since Black Panther is a well-developed character. Plus, the villain got more personal screen time, so for me it's one of the best villain of the MCU made thus far.The overload of jokes was toned down for this movie, which i think its a really good for two reasons: It fits the moral of the story, and previous marvel movies were full-on comedies, with not so great humor. So Marvel fan will have a blast, and im sure this movie will pick a large audience, not only Marvel Fans. It's a great action flick, with a great soundtrack too ! It's just not different from what you have already seen. It's good, go see it if you are interested, otherwise I don't think you will enjoy it, and will be rather disapointed with all the good reviews its getting (87/100 on metacritic). I enjoyed it more than previous and recent Marvel movies, but I dont think it's the best marvel movie at all (like the praise its getting).",6,26,71,14 February 2018
