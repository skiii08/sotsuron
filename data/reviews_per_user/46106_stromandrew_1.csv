The Lobster," Worst movie I ever saw!
","It's like bad fan fiction! It's not metaphor, it's just really, really bad. As one who has read plenty of fan fiction on the Internet, this is about as bad as those stories come.Holy cow this is bad. I really admire the actors, though, for putting up with this truly awful script. It's hilariously, yet uncomfortably, bad.Worst movie I ever saw, and I didn't even see the whole thing. Two hours is much too long for this monstrosity.I'm going to guess that the guy who wrote this is single, in his twenties (though he writes like he's in his teens), and may have a deviated septum. Just a hunch though. He's a drama queen, dramatic and sad about being single (I know the feeling), and he has a DeviantArt account.Now I'm going to google it and see how close I was.",1,8,11,10 August 2016
