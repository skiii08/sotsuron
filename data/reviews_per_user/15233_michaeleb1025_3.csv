Blade Runner 2049," Disappointing at best
","I admit I was not pleased when I heard about this project but I hoped for the best. Then the preview looked really boring and tedious. Watching the final film, I saw that it could actually be cut down to about 45 minutes. There are scenes that needlessly take forever. The look of the film was exceedingly disappointing. Too much dusty haze in different colors. The art direction made the original one of the most influential film in Fashion, Art, and Interior Design of the eighties. In this movie it is just a boring display of a lot of oversimplified flat surfaces. The grotty and baroque kitschy qualities of the original's vision are no where to be found. The old live action version of Cashern is a much more interesting watch than this. The clothes of this movie were abysmally simple like a bad Donatella Versace Collection. The hooker's outfit was even a pathetic knockoff of the the original Tris. I was so irritated on so many levels. The large set pieces of nudes reminded me of a bad homage to AI by Spielberg. Dramatic pacing was non existent. Casting was rather dubious with pretty boy Jared Leto's usual kinky villain not really working very well. Robin Wright was a complete bore. The critics who loved this must be a clueless bunch of SciFi fanboys. Aside from money, was there any good reason to make this thing?",2,2,3,20 January 2018
Interstellar," I tried but it failed, boringly
","So much of this film is so mediocre on so many levels that even though my young film nut friends recommended it highly, I could not muster any enthusiasm for it. I had trouble just getting through it. Maybe it was the lack of originality. When you see lighting, camera setups and set pieces borrowed from other movies you could think homage, but this piece demands complete innovation. The acting was tedious. Maybe it was the casting of a big name Hollywood bore in the lead. Maybe it was because the music was so drab and ponderous. Hans Zimmer is over used but not particularly gifted. Maybe the visuals were OK, but I did notice a space ship or two that were a little too optically printed. This movie would have benefited greatly by being created exclusively in the digital realm. Christopher Nolan's pretentious use of dead pixel film grain make the image lose intensity at times. What made 2001 a marvel in its time (also the film that this film tries to elaborate on), was the extreme precision of its image. Stanley Kubrick used the then state of the art 70mm Super Panavision and the best lenses that he could borrow or steal. In this present era 8k imaging would have helped this film attain a much finer quality that would made its other faults almost bearable. If you want to see better 'end of the world as we know it' films, there are a great number of them that are either ludicrously fun or serious and inventive. They are a pleasure to watch compared to this tedious mess of environmentalist propaganda. If Christopher Nolan wants to keep remaking other peoples films, great. I just don't think he deserves the bloated praise some people are giving him for his efforts. I love movies about science fiction, fantasy, outer space travel and special effects. I have enjoyed movies like Pacific Rim, Kickass, Star Trek and even Avatar with its bizarre messages. Call me a troll or a hater, but I was very disappointed with this thing.",3,6,11,8 April 2015
Blade Runner," The 4K Version is atrocious
","This film is a masterwork of science fiction. It deserves a better 4K presentation than the one produced recently. I got a digital download and was supremely disappointed by the horribly grainy overly polarized bleached out image. I know it is not my equipment because I have other 4K downloads and discs that are stunningly beautiful. This version is on a par with the disastrous Bluray version of The King and I (which includes a gorgeous digital HD download that points out all the flaws of the disc) Wait to buy it when someone actually takes the time to remaster it properly for 4K and not rush it out to coincide with the release of a bad sequel. I also have the five disc, five version set on Bluray. It shows how Scott has trouble knowing what the final version should be. It is advisedly a much better purchase. I remember seeing this film when it first came out and this 4K is a pathetic grainy shadow of the beautiful 70mm print I saw in the early 80s.",8,0,0,28 October 2017
