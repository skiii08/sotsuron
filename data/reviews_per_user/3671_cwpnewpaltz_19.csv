The Legend of Bagger Vance," An uplifting fable, told with a deft touch by a master directing a fine cast.
","Everything I'd heard or read -- except Roger Ebert and Jeff Lyons -- said this movie was sentimental twaddle. It didn't seem likely, though, that this fine a director and cast could so thoroughly sink the ball in every water hazard known to movie making, so I thought I'd give it a shot. Actually, it's a first rate, uplifting tale of redemption through love and  the act of rediscovering who you are. Matt Damon was wonderful in his role, adding another fine acting turn to a filmography that now includes a number of good guys (which seem to suit him well) and one stinker (Ripley), which may have been bad casting. He grows, he excels at self-discovery, and he's fun to watch. Theron had me transfixed -- in a world of post-pubescent female leads, none of whom will ever amount to diddly (or get another role) after the first onset of wrinkles at the mouth and a tummy, she has the glamorous aura of a genuine studio star of yesterday; and yes, she can act. Will Smith has been one likeable guy after another for years, and I like his smarts and his sass. As to Robert Redford's turn as director once again, he can continue to fight cynicism by waging a classy war for moral uplift through groundedness as long as he likes, and I'll love every minute of it, whether he's swinging a bat or a club, healing people or horses. I've had enough car chases, enough people trying to get laughs through farts and scatology, enough dumbing down to the lowest common denominator. This is a glossy, beautifully told, gorgeously photographed story that makes you feel good. Only one question bugs me -- why wasn't Jack Lemmon credited. His role as narrator was as big as anyone's on screen. There's a tale there.",8,0,1,31 March 2001
Fight Club," Better than expected, no less violent, but more intelligent. Still, in the end, unbelievable.
","OK, I'm an old codger compared to most of those who visit this site, but I'm a real movie fanatic. And Fight Club is not one of the 30-odd greatest movies of all time, nor is Edward Norton the greatest actor of all time. But this is an interesting film, mostly because one doesn't even know its genre until it's almost over. Sci-fi horror, that's about as close as I can come, unless madness is a genre. The whole idea of this narrator with his meaningless life bringing us into his insane world without letting us know until the end that he's insane, not just bored and sullen, and it's insane (and not just an attempt to gain meaning through violence) is really pretty clever. But the climax has no credibility; it's just a great visual effect. (I saw this on DVD, by the way, and thought all the director's and special effects guys' comments were interesting, but really made it clear they were done for their own sake and with awards and kudos in mind). This really is movie-making for the MTV generation, and if anyone of that generation really feels upset that he was deprived of recession, war and pestilence, given an expensive education and subsequently accepted a high-paying white collar job and its attendant condo lifestyle, I say, hey, it's not illegal to join the Peace Corps or the Army and actually be of use to someone other than yourself.",7,0,2,28 July 2000
Shakespeare in Love," The best Shakespeare movie ever made, and it's not even as silly a plot as half the comedies he wrote himself
","If verbal swordplay is your idea of a good time at the movies, then this is one of the best ever. An imagined tale of how Shakespeare overcame writer's block to write one of the most cherished of all his plays, this is witty, sly, clever, endearing and engrossing scriptwriting, beautifully acted with great elan by some of the best England has to offer: in a word, romantic comedy at its height.",10,0,2,13 June 2000
12 Angry Men," More drama, tension and fascinating psychology than any newer thriller
","Henry Fonda's best role. Gripping, dramatic, an extraordinarily powerful film more truthful than any documentary. It is also an important primer on the prime directive of American jurisprudence: that we as a nation prefer that 100 guilty men go free than that a single innocent person be convicted. The concept of 'guilt beyond a reasonable doubt' is nowhere defined in the American legal code or Constitution. This movie does it for us. It also makes clear why no one, not even the President of the United States, may commit perjury without deliberately working to undermine the very basis of our legal system.",10,0,1,6 June 2000
The English Patient," It's pretty easy to see that the problems of this crazy world don't matter worth a hill of beans compared to the desires of us two little people.
","My how the world has changed since Rick Blaine gave up his exit visa in Casablanca so that Elsa's husband could continue his important work in the fight for freedom. There in that same desert, unknown to Rick and Louie, our Hungarian map maker in the employ of the British was busy selling the plans for the defense of Tobruk to Rommel's Panzer's so that -- let me see if I get this right -- he could get a used plane to fly into the desert and pick up the undoubtedly dead body of his lover, who just happened to be someone else's wife. No shooting the Gestapo colonel, no 'Round up the usual suspects.' Instead, it's informing on an incomprehensively grand scale for personal pleasure. Lucky our hero wasn't in Eisenhower's headquarters to filch a copy of the plans for Overlord, or Rommel would have been in full force on Omaha, Juno and Utah Beaches, Private Ryan would have been lying dead in a French field, and our standard morning greeting in this country would be 'Sig Hiel'. This is, without a doubt, ethically the single most offensive movie I've ever seen, its warm reception and rave reviews a testament to the decline of the West.",7,0,3,2 June 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Great retelling of a classic tale
","I hate horror movies. But this isn't a horror movie, it's the ultimate blending of all the creepy, macabre story-telling skills of Tim Burton. It doesn't matter whether he's changed the story, or given it a twist that the author never intended. Basically, it's Hound of the Baskervilles meets computer wizardry in a rollicking tale that grips and holds and leaves one breathless. Since it's all in good fun, an easy night's sleep follows. Wonderful for children of all ages.",10,0,0,2 June 2000
Closer," Who cares about these self-absorbed losers?
","Another movie about thoroughly unlikeable people willing to destroy other human beings for their own personal gratification; how utterly delightful. I generally like Julia Roberts, and think Jude Law is sensational, but I cannot get excited about an actor's skill in roles such as these. I don't want to know these people, I don't have any empathy for their mutually inflicted wounds, and anyone who believes this is 'real', this is how it is, relationships always go like this is suffering the well-deserved maladies of the 'I'm my hero' generation. There are actually real live people in this world who care about each other, who try not to hurt each other, who worry about what the 'other' in their unit of two wants so that they can satisfy that need. This is sick, Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice after 35 years of casual sex, multiple pairings and self indulgence has left them rolling in the gutter, exhausted and disgusted with themselves and each other.",5,3,6,11 April 2005
Forrest Gump," No one ever went broke under-estimating the taste of the American public
","This is a 'cute' movie. Tom Hanks is cute. The video clips are cute, to say nothing of technologically advanced. Let's face it, this guy Gump knew everyone, met everyone, and did everything, and there are pictures to prove it. He was a hero and a Medal of Honor winner and he took care of his slutty girl-friend who had sex so often with so many different people that she got this disease no one even had a name for back then, but he just wanted to marry her anyway. On top of that, he was warm-hearted and sweet and a warm and fuzzy human being. So what if he was a 'dull normal' in IQ terms? He triumphed over all the egg-heads and nerds, and you, Joe Six-Pack and your brainless children, you too can triumph over them by being a mediocre, slow, plodding, non-comprehending, low-IQ individual. You will win in this technologically cut-throat world-wide competitive market by being nice. The meek will inherit the earth. Take that Bill Gates!",6,5,9,10 June 2000
Cast Away," Everything The Perfect Storm was not. Just extraordinary.
","It's not necessary to use many words to describe this movie, as it doesn't use many to tell its story. Awesome silence and aching loneliness mold and sculpt (literally) a man who must deal with cruel fate and cruel nature. The waves that come crashing in on his little island to imprison him as surely as steel bars are far more real, real looking and fearful than the computer-generated fakes in The Perfect Storm. This is the real thing. Tom Hanks is a shoo-in for a Best Actor nomination.",10,0,0,27 December 2000
The Patriot," Braveheart comes to America
","Good action, good story, good and gory special effects in the battle scenes. It always seemed to me that having men dressed in brightly colored coats with an 'X' over the center of their chest, firing muskets at each other while standing at point blank range, was a dumb and inhumane way of fighting a war. This movie proves conclusively that the carnage was just as grisly during the Revolution as it was on the beaches of Normandy, man's inhumanity to man just as debased two hundred years ago as it was in the infamous twentieth century. Or maybe it just proves that the technology of war always leads to terrible suffering among the innocent who stand in the way. Some things seemed overstated, however: we know that in France the Nazis locked all the old men, women and children in a town inside the church and burned it with full loss of life, and it stands as a monuments today; but do we know that this was done by the Redcoats during the Revolution? Certainly, it's a first for me, and if untrue a gratuitous insult. Mel Gibson was fine, but maybe after twenty years or so he should try a different film personna. Even Sean Connery got too old for James Bond, after all.",9,0,0,1 July 2000
Spider-Man," Among the weakest of the comic-book spinoffs
","Rank order (1) the children's fantasy books made into movies, and (2) the comic-books-come-to-life, and where will Spiderman come in? Well, for those of you old enough, the Superman trilogy with Christopher Reeve would have to rank pretty high; personally I think Dick Tracy was tops among the comics, with fabulous color and cinematography, a story that could hold one's interest, and a really engaging star in Warren Beatty. The original Batman was pretty fantastic. I don't read comic books, but I'd have to say I liked even X-Men better than Spiderman. And among the fantasies, Lord of the Rings takes the all-time cake, and Harry Potter was pretty good too. Spiderman is a modest attempt; it wasn't good enough to make me want to see (or even rent) the sequels.",6,0,0,10 November 2002
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Kung-fu costume drama with good acting but ridiculous martial arts
","Don't know what I expected, really. I guess I was hoping for something like Kagemusha or the original Seven Samurai. But Kurosawa's gone, and Mifune too, and this is Chinese rather than Japanese, so one should probably be grateful for the good acting and lush location scenery that saved this otherwise absurd martial arts picture. People cannot walk up vertical walls and fly, even if they go to special monasteries to meditate. You want fantasy? Try, 'Ladyhawke.' Overblown, overrated and beyond the pale.",7,0,0,14 January 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Very entertaining, but less than the original
","Let it be fairly said that this is a highly entertaining movie, with a wonderful storyline, good acting, and great special effects. Nonetheless, it did not bowl me over the way The Fellowship of the Ring did, and I suppose it's simply that the standard of the first movie was so high, wildly exceeding expectations, that it was hard for this movie to have the same impact. And somehow Frodo became less sympathetic in this movie, probably a reflection of the ring's growing power over him. Still, the battle scenes were wonderful, and I happily paid my money to see it. I don't think I'll buy the video, though, which says something about the difference from Fellowship, which I got as soon as it was available.",9,0,0,29 December 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Bizarre, boring, pretentious, derivative and a real drag
","Was this the worst movie I've ever seen? Well, let's see, I'm pretty sure it's the only '1' I've ever assigned; I almost gagged when they broke in with 'The Sound of Music' right there at the beginning, and it went downhill from there. So bad I decided to read the Wall St. Journal while this thing played on the DVD through my elaborate sound system. I think that if you saw 'Cabaret' you saw this movie without having to bother. The Golden Globe Awards must be crazy.",1,7,13,20 December 2001
Mulholland Drive," Too self-consciously arty by half, or just bad editing?
","Look, I like artsy movies as much as anyone, but I didn't find this artistic, or enjoyable, or overwhelmingly complex and hard to understand and in need of three viewings, as so many commentators seem to. I thought the story was quite straightforward once you figured out what was real and what was a dream, and might have just been called, 'The Face on the Cutting Room Floor' (thank you, Steve Goodman.) Won't say any more than that, as I don't want to give away its supposed secrets. I will say I find movies in which I can't figure out what's going on until half way through to be annoyingly frustrating, not artistic. 'Two for the Road,' (Hepburn/Finney) was a complicated story told through multiple backward/forward time jumps, and made perfect sense. 'Memento' had a lot of similarities to 'Mulholland,' but made perfect sense. This movie just felt narcissistic, self-indulgent and badly edited.",4,0,2,13 April 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Visually stunning anime cartoon with human actors
","I thought I'd hate this film. Over the top violence isn't my thing. Finally decided I should give it a try, and liked it so much I rented it twice, so my wife could see it too. Since I am not an afficionado of Hong Kong-style or Japanese-style or any other style action movies, and haven't ever seen a Bruce Lee movie, etc., I'm illiterate in the matter of all the homages Tarantino was paying. But I know a good story line when I see one, and the thing that was so interesting to me was that I found myself really caring about the Uma Thurman (Black Mambo) character and rooting for her in her justifiable quest for revenge. Considering what a killing machine she was, that was quite an accomplishment. Maybe Tarantino is just punk hype, and maybe he's only made 6 films to date (including Vol.2), but he's visually arresting and makes you ask why you identify with certain inherently evil characters when others (say Tony Soprano) fill you with revulsion. As to the mayhem, it was just a cartoon and not at all objectionable to anyone over the age of 6.",10,0,2,26 May 2004
Mission: Impossible II," Boring and unbelievable
","What a turkey!! At least the first Tom Cruise MI movie paid lip service to the constructs and concepts of the original TV series. This was nothing but the conceit of Cruise's ego. A boring virus story (done much better in The Andromeda Strain and even Dustin Hoffman's virus movie of a few years ago) becomes the excuse for all the trickery of boring recent James Bond movies combined with the violence of Terminator II raised to the nth power. I put on the DVD and after ten minutes realized I'd rather read pre-election coverage in the NY Times, and THAT's boring. It turned out to be perfectly possible to read same and watch the movie simultaneously, missing nothing of consequence because there was nothing of consequence.And there are the special features of the DVD, which attempt to make us believe that Cruise did all these rock stunts in Moab HIMSELF, 2000 feet in the air, with no net or rope, and made the same unbelievable jump about 15 times to get the shot right. Oh sure. Tell me another one.",3,0,1,6 November 2000
The Matrix," Special effects for the sake of special effects in a story with no ending
","Well, this is the lowest rating I've ever given a film (3). Boring beyond belief. It's not like the idea is new; in fact, I would think the producer of this film would have to pay royalties to the guy who wrote 'The Thirteenth Floor', I think it was, with Craig Bierko. That movie was entertaining and suspenseful. This is just the worst. You like science fiction? see 'Last Night.' You want another film about a manufactured universe? How about 'The Truman Show?' This was a total waste of time, and I'm afraid its rating as #31 on the all-time honors list, at this writing, is just a testament to the fact that too few people my age can really use the internet. Keanau Reeves better stop doing this stuff, 'cause, like McCauley Culkin, he's gonna outgrow them.",3,3,8,12 September 2000
Thirteen Days," Action-packed, exciting. Now, if only it were true.
","Nice job by Costner, understated in performance, probably because he didn't direct. But I don't really want to review the movie, which is good; rather I'd like to correct the history.The actual destroyer USS Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. (DD-850), which intercepted the Russian freighter Marucla during the blockade, was towed out of the naval museum in Fall River, Mass and put to sea under tow for this movie. Two different numbers were painted on her hull, port and starboard, so she could represent two different destroyers in the blockade for the film, and the DASH helicopter deck and ASROC were disguised because they were a post-1962 FRAM MK II conversion. I'm pretty involved with her, as an ex-crewman: I was the CIC and Intelligence officer from 1965-67. During my tour, there were still plenty of old salts around who had been on board during the blockade, and they told a different story than the world knows and the movie tells.Their story is that the JP Kennedy was nowhere near Cuba when the blockade was instituted, but rather off Bermuda (1000 nautical miles, more or less); and as the freighters bearing missiles approached the island, the rest of the Navy was ordered to stand down so the JP Kennedy, namesake of the President's brother, could steam toward the island at emergency flank speed using the 'war sprayer plates' for the boilers, always kept in the Captain's safe, and be there for the photo op of making the first interception.
At least the movie properly lays the blame for the chaos of two messages from Krushchev squarely on JFK and RFK's stupid idea of leaking the Turkey missile exchange gambit to a sympathetic press. And lest we forget, Sen. Kenneth Keating (R-NY) had been screaming about missiles in Cuba the previous December, but it was hotly denied by the White House until weeks before a mid-term election the party in power was widely expected to lose. Never switch horses during a crisis, they say...Indeed, the world little knew how close it came to catastrophe to satisfy JFK's political ambitions.",8,0,0,7 August 2001
