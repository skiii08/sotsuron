Miracle," Great movie, very inspirational
","I really liked this movie. The action was great, and Kurt Russell's Herb Brooks accent was dead-on. I watched this movie sitting next to Ken Morrow, #3 on the US team, and he said the action and events were pretty accurate, although they had him left-handed a few times. I would also like to commend Disney for putting out a movie without the saccharine, and at the same time not filling it with foul language and nudity. The ONLY thing I didn't like was Russell's hair in the movie, which looked like a Devo helmet or a thick coating of shellac. Also, Herb Brooks was only 41-42 years old during the timespan of the events depicted in the movie, but Kurt Russell was 52 years old while filming the movie, and it shows. Nevertheless, Russell's acting is superlative, and you really feel like you are there. Watching the world events of the time makes you want to vote for Reagan all over again!",9,0,0,30 January 2004
