The Rock," The sophomore film from former music video and commercial director Michael Bay.
","What does one need to know about The Rock? Well, it's one very entertaining and thrilling film, but there's not much else to it. Still, I think it's one of the best action films of the 1990s. At times it's somewhat dumb, at times it's inconsistent, the whole package however is so appealing that you can watch it again and again and not get tired of it. It features some breathtaking San Francisco scenery. The performances are memorable, especially by the three leads. Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage and Ed Harris are very good in this film. The scenes on Alcatraz are exciting, and the prison was filmed very well. Michael Bay, however, is not a great director. The jokes and action are impressive but tight filmmaking this is not. Bay relies too much on quick cuts and snappy dialogue instead of trying to build truly impressive scenes. The story too is hardly anything to write about. Bay can deliver the visuals though. The score by Hans Zimmer is another strong point. Most of all The Rock is a feel-good film. It's by far my favourite film by Bay, and I recommend seeing it.",6,2,3,13 November 2010
The Avengers," The Avengers turned out to be a predictable summer flick.
","The Avengers became a big success at the box office but, in reality, it's not that great. It's a fine film, with a lot of action. In the end, however, it's a passable Hollywood product. The plot is something that only a comic book reader will enjoy or fully understand, and it's there only to show several different and iconic superheroes working together. The actors do a fine job but, for me, there were no standout performances. Perhaps the only one who stood out was Chris Evans as Captain America because he was righteous, old-fashioned, and he wasn't sarcastic. And this brings me to the script by Joss Whedon, which is quite poor. I guess it wasn't easy to write a good screenplay in which each superhero has to seem relevant. This is the biggest reason why the script fails to surprise. For example, Robert Downey Jr. is his usual self as Iron Man but there's nothing that stands out in his performance. He had a lot more to work with in Iron Man (2008), and there was plenty more drama there too. The script is rather predictable, and the characters don't come off well because they have nothing important to say. The main villain Loki is also a letdown. I like Tom Hiddleston but his character has little to do except walk, talk and look menacing. Add to this a horde of enemies about whom we know almost nothing and we have one rather boring second half of the film. The heroes fight the enemies like they're shooting cans at target practice. They employ their skills, and it's all quite dull because there are too many weak and faceless enemies. The final battle reminded me a lot of Transformers (2007). Joss Whedon does a good job as director, but The Avengers is still a by the numbers action summer blockbuster. Yes, the special effects are impressive in places. Other than that there's nothing here to get excited about. Films like Iron Man (2008), Thor (2011) and The Incredible Hulk (2008) had more to like than this film. The addition of silly and predictable humor only makes the film seem more forgettable. The Avengers entertains during most of its running time but there's nothing here to take to heart.",9,2,6,7 May 2012
Come and See," '...and I heard one of the four living creatures saying, as with a voice of thunder, 'Come and see!'
","Come And See is a one-of-a-kind film. It's a film that shows the brutality and horror of war without hesitation. Its reputation has grown considerably since its release, mostly by word of mouth. The film was even included in Channel 4's list of 50 Films to See Before You Die. Come And See is a psychological horror drama about and occurring during the Nazi German occupation of the Belarussian SSR, in 1943.The film has to be seen, that's all there is to it. There is no other anti-war film as effective as this one. Taken together, it's a series of horrifying events in which Florya (Aleksei Kravchenko) gets involved in. What sets these scenes apart from, for example Hollywood films, is that they realistically portray what it would have been like to live in fear during the total war in the USSR. For example, in one scene German soldiers parachute into a forest during sunset. Florya and a girl his age are there too. They hide, observing the soldiers. The soldiers pass, some distance away. There is some firing. Bullets hit trees, splinters fly. The soldiers' faces can't be seen. Florya and the girl are obviously terrified. The soldiers are like an unstoppable force which will devour them if it sees them. Music is used to great effect too. But it's not uplifting music (though there is a scene where partisans listen to Sacred War) or horror movie music. It's rhythmically amorphous mostly, and it's the sort of sounds you may hear when you're in awe or when you're preoccupied with something and can't hear what else is going on around you.The Red Army isn't present in the film. Partisans are present sometimes. Come And See is no documentary film. I should note that some people may find it strange or hard to watch, but it leads to a finale that is both awesome and disturbing. The war that Adolf Hitler began in Russia, a war of brutality and no consideration for human life, is shown in all its effects in the Belarussian countryside. In the end it's shown that all this hate and suffering was begun by a man who was once a boy, a boy with a mother. What's interesting is how different Come And See is from other Soviet films. Soviet films are typically about bravery and liberation, but Come And See is clearly anti-war though some war images in the film are some of the most impressive I have ever seen. Elem Klimov, the director, lived through the World War II, and this one film he made clearly shows that there's more to war than soldiers fighting. Come And See is a masterpiece. It's also one of the great war films.",9,2,2,12 October 2010
Howl's Moving Castle," Once again there is still room for meaning in the world of charming, animated fantasy.
","Director Hayao Miyazaki took Diana Wynne Jones's novel as a basis for his follow-up to Oscar-winner Spirited Away (2001), but adds in his own overriding themes - man's relationship to nature, the futility of war, and the joy of flight. The natural world is beautifully represented as in his previous films, with some absolutely breathtaking mountain and lakeside landscapes. The finest creation of the film, though, is the Castle itself, a cross between Baba Yaga's hut, a Heath Robinson contraption, and one of Terry Gilliam's strange hybrid hens from Monty Python's Flying Circus. The film won a clutch of awards in Japan and overseas, including an Oscar nomination. Howl's Moving Castle is essentially a love story. Talk of magic being used to shield palaces while innocent villages are bombed clues viewers into the deliberate parallels being drawn with the Gulf War of 2003, a conflict that enraged the pacifist Miyazaki during the film's production. If there's one criticism, it's that the overly neat happy ending feels like a cheat after the previous seriousness of the war strand of the story. Yet it remains a complex, rewarding film graced with the acutely observed, colourful and imaginative artwork that is the hallmark of Japan's greatest living national treasure of animation.",8,1,2,9 October 2010
The Monuments Men," A war movie with an ensemble cast that suffers from poor pacing, direction and characterization.
","From CFR member George Clooney comes the cartoonish The Monuments Men, a blatant piece of Anglo-American propaganda. It's a good thing that I got to see this film for free. Director Clooney and screenwriter Grant Heslov took a real World War II story and turned it into an average film with few redeeming factors. There are abundant war movie clichés and propaganda clichés here, like the American obsession with the value of every soldier's life, the constant mention of Jews and what they allegedly went through, and stereotypical portrayals of protagonists and antagonists alike. The film may be based on a true story but it's been changed so much that it has almost nothing in common with that story. Even the names of the main characters have been changed. Some of Hollywood's biggest names participated in the film but they're mostly just playing themselves. George Clooney, for example, isn't really playing George L. Stout. He's playing George Clooney. The propaganda is constant, so you're always reminded that all Americans and their British buddies are freedom-lovers. The filmmakers also wanted to squeeze in as much comedy as possible. The American characters come off as a group of bunglers who tell jokes every chance they get. The German characters too are played for laughs as often as possible, and there's hardly any menace to them. Strangely, the only characters that are portrayed with any seriousness are the Russians, and these allies of the Americans are the only ones who seem menacing here. My question is why were the Russians even included in this film? Was it just so they could see that flag left behind by the 'freedom-loving' Americans? Talk about strange. The only information the film offers about the Russians is that 20 million Russians were killed during the war. Yes, but it would have been more worthwhile to mention that the Germans looted or destroyed plenty of Russian art too. For example, the historic city of St. Petersburg was heavily bombed by the Germans. Most palaces, houses and monuments weren't left standing there. So a lot of what can be seen in the city now was rebuilt after the war. It's obvious that The Monuments Men was made for propaganda purposes. It was a rushed job too. The filmmakers didn't take the story seriously. Therefore, the film is a big failure. The performances by the ensemble cast are muted. John Goodman, playing Walker Hancock, and Bill Murray, playing Robert K. Posey, are the ones who suffer most in this respect. They could have been replaced by unknown actors and it wouldn't have made a difference. The only part of the story that seems developed is the relationship between James Rorimer (Matt Damon) and Rose Valland (Cate Blanchett). Everything else seems half-baked, especially the humorous conflict between Posey and Lincoln Kirstein (Bob Balaban). There were times when Clooney demonstrated that he can be a very good director. However, The Monuments Men is flawed both as a history lesson and as a men-on-a-mission movie. I don't recommend it.The filmmakers claim that the film is based on the book The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves And The Greatest Treasure Hunt In History by Robert M. Edsel. That may be true, but I think that they got the idea for making it from a Voice Of Russia interview.

The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Strong acting and an insightful approach make this teen drama memorable.
","The Perks Of Being A Wallflower is a neat teen drama which delves into some serious subject matter. It was written and directed by Stephen Chbosky as an adaptation of his 1999 novel, and the result is impressive. Logan Lerman does a good job playing Charlie, a smart but sensitive teen who goes through quite a bit during the film. Chbosky set the story during the mid-1990s. Topics such as homosexuality, drugs, obsession, suicide and death are raised, so this isn't quite a John Hughes sort of comedy-drama. Emma Watson and Ezra Miller sure do shine in their supporting roles. But there is commitment from every actor involved, and Chbosky's intelligent and insightful screenplay puts them into memorable and reality-filled scenes. Paul Rudd as Charlie's English teacher Mr. Anderson and Mae Whitman as Sam and Patrick's friend Mary Elizabeth are perfect here. As to be expected in this sort of film there are discussions about music, and the soundtrack plays a part in the film. It's comprised of songs from the 1980s. One memorable scene features Charlie, Sam and Patrick cruising through a freeway tunnel while listening to a tune by David Bowie. In conclusion, The Perks Of Being A Wallflower is a solid effort by Chbosky which delivers on all fronts. It's a difficult story but it's the best teen drama in years. It's worth seeing.",8,2,4,22 October 2012
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," A terrific action summer movie with a fresh visual style.
","After watching Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter at home I asked myself why I didn't go to see it in a movie theater during the summer. I should have but I guess the reason was that I thought the premise was silly. Too bad because this is a terrific action film. It's very entertaining but I stress that it's not dumb. All the actors deliver good performances. Benjamin Walker creates a fantastic hero in Abraham Lincoln, a secret vampire hunter and the 16th President of the United States. Walker is good in the action scenes as well as at delivering Lincoln's historic lines. He begins hunting vampires as a young man with the assistance of his mentor Henry Sturges (Dominic Cooper). Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Lincoln's wife Mary Todd and Anthony Mackie plays his closest friend William Johnson. Rufus Sewell as Adam is the film's main antagonist, a powerful vampire with an interesting story. The film is based on Seth Grahame-Smith's mashup novel of the same name. It plays very much like a comic book movie, and it takes liberties with the facts of Lincoln's life while poking fun at some of them. Director Timur Bekmambetov has a talent for creating impressive visuals, but here with the assistance of cinematographer Caleb Deschanel the look of the film is often stunning. The scene in which Lincoln fights Jack Barts on horseback at sunset is just one amazing highlight. Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter earned almost twice its budget at the box office but it should have been a bigger hit. It's serious fantasy horror. I won't be surprised if it becomes a cult movie. It's one of the best films of 2012, and I definitely recommend seeing it.",8,36,57,28 November 2012
Star Trek," Director J.J. Abrams resurrects the classic science fiction franchise created by Gene Roddenberry with this feature film.
","Star Trek is a successful update of a franchise that desperately needed an update. The film doesn't raise any new ideas in science-fiction and that's what keeps it from being a great film, but just about everything else about it is shiny and polished. Star Trek is the eleventh film based on the Star Trek franchise and features the main characters of the original Star Trek television series, who are portrayed by a new cast. The film follows James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto), before they unite aboard the USS Enterprise to combat Nero (Eric Bana), a Romulan from the future who threatens the United Federation of Planets.Watching Star Trek was the best time I had at the movies for well over a year. After the first part of the film ended and the film's title appeared accompanied by an uplifting music piece I felt the hair on my head rise up. From then I knew that this was going to be a good film. Star Trek isn't burdened by showing Kirk's and Spock's childhoods. It's all done rather quickly at the beginning. The fun starts when the two become young men. Chris Pine as Kirk provides most of the humor while Zachary Quinto as Spock is always serious and all-knowing. Both of them are very likable as is the rest of the crew of the USS Eterprise. For me the other standout performances were from Karl Urban as Leonard 'Bones' McCoy and Anton Yelchin as Pavel Chekov. Things were always interesting when Chekov was on screen. Zoe Saldana as Nyota Uhura turns out to be a strong female presence on the Enterprise (and by the way she's just gorgeous in this film). Simon Pegg as Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott is also good and as is to be expected, funny. And I can't forget John Cho as Hikaru Sulu. It was great to see him as the pilot of the Enterprise and then as a competent fencer. Eric Bana as the villain Nero on the other hand wasn't given much screen time. Although he's menacing and cool we don't see him do much other than giving orders and being angry. However, he, his crew and their gigantic Romulan mining ship Narada pose a real threat to the Federation throughout the film.Now, what about the special effects? The special effects are state of the art. They look great too. For once in a science-fiction film we aren't shown a doomed future for mankind, but a prosperous one instead. Seeing the construction of a Federation space ship in Iowa or the incredibly tall skyscrapers and neat streets in the San Francisco of the future was like a breath of fresh air for me. Human science and tolerance has progressed in the future of Star Trek and that's fantastic. The space battles are also spectacular. Watching the Federation fleet go into warp speed was awe-inspiring for me. Oh, I almost forgot about Leonard Nimoy's presence in the film. I'm not going to spoil anything, but I will mention that his Spock plays an important role in the story. So he's not there just for show. Seeing Nimoy back was an additional treat for me. Star Trek is a blast from beginning to end. It's thrilling, funny, touching and action-packed. I give Star Trek a high recommendation.",8,1,4,13 October 2010
Inglourious Basterds," A film that pretends to be thoughtful, and turns out to be disappointing.
","Inglorious Basterds convinced me that Quentin Tarantino lost it. That's not to say that he is now a bad director, but his films ever since Pulp Fiction have been all style and little substance. Pulp Fiction was a wicked masterpiece and one of the greatest films of the 1990s, but what am I to make of Inglorious Basterds? This film disappointed me even more than Kill Bill. Kill Bill was, for the most part, shallow, bloody and uninspired. Still, it was entertaining and the performances were memorable. Inglorious Basterds is just like Kill Bill except there aren't any fights and only one memorable performance. I'm not saying that it's a bad film; it's actually quite good technically. Tarantino's direction is solid, but not great. The actors deliver, especially Christoph Waltz and Brad Pitt. The cinematography is good, and the film seems inspired in places. For the most part, however, I kept thinking what this is really about?The film has a historic setting (Nazi-occupied France in 1944), but it's not meant to be taken seriously. The film has style (however pointless), but Nazis like Adolf Hitler were included. The pro-German and fascist/conservative minded reviewers have already expressed their opinions here. However, I don't care for Nazi Germany at all. In this film an SS Colonel somehow comes off as the most likable character. He's a clever intellectual who speaks a few languages. Except that this is a man whose job is to find and execute as many Jews and other undesirables as possible. This is a clear case of misrepresentation I think. Violence that's hard to watch is also included. An American Lieutenant and his team of Jewish men kill Nazis in brutal ways. These killings are shown in all their detailed glory. So it seems that it's not the Germans who are the ruthless and exceptional murderers but an American team. There are other things in the film that didn't take place for real. I don't think Tarantino meant to take sides, but all this film has is several conversation scenes and several murder scenes. In parts it's entertaining but there's nothing to take away from it. In the end it feels shallow and pointless. I don't recommend Inglorious Basterds, but by popular vote this film made it into the IMDb Top 250. For my money I'd rather see films that are meant to be historically accurate and thoughtful like Schindler's List (1993) and Come And See (1985).",9,7,16,15 July 2010
Creed," Big-budget, studio-produced franchise films don't get any better than this.
","This modern take on the Rocky story is a lot better than I expected. I was never a fan of Sylvester Stallone, and no one would disagree that he eventually drove the Rocky series into a swamp. Rocky (1976) is an excellent and influential film. Its legacy can be seen in the wonderful The Karate Kid (1984), also directed by John G. Avildsen. Rocky II (1979) is good, but largely a repeat of the first. Rocky III (1982) is competent, but commercial, and it showed that the 1980s have arrived. Rocky IV (1985) is all formula and all propaganda. Rocky V (1990) is the worst thing ever (just kidding). And, finally, Rocky Balboa (2006) is flawed but better than expected. So, it's clear that every successive film in the series became worse. But now, because of Creed, the series is back on top. Creed is easily the best in the series since Rocky II. Why is that? Well, it's because the director this time is Ryan Coogler, and Stallone is in a supporting role. Coogler came up with a workable idea for the film - let's make the main character the son of former world heavyweight champion Apollo Creed, and let's make Rocky his trainer and mentor. It's an idea that, with Coogler's writing and direction, works surprisingly well. One can say that Creed has the same formula as every Rocky film, but, if the film is this well-made and uplifting, is that a problem? As for Stallone, he delivers one of his best performances ever. In fact, he upstages Michael B. Jordan, who plays Adonis Creed, in just about every scene that they have together. But Jordan isn't a disappointment. He has the good looks for a big budget Hollywood movie. More importantly, he breathes remarkable life into the title role, showing that Adonis is a cocksure, exuberant and loyal character. The only problem with Adonis is his relationship with his love interest Bianca (Tessa Thompson). This relationship is poorly developed and not entirely believable. Still, some of the scenes with Bianca are tender and candid. The fight scenes are, for the most part, exciting. They don't have the same punch as the fight scenes that Avildsen and Stallone filmed in Rocky and Rocky II, but they're well-done and they pay off. One of the problems is that Creed's opponent isn't presented well as someone who's tough and dangerous. Because of this, one doesn't get the feeling that Adonis has to overcome a big challenge. By the way, Coogler and cinematographer Maryse Alberti also did a good job filming in Philadelphia, showing a city in an economic depression. So, in my view, there are a few faults with the script and with characterization. Still, on the whole, Creed works very well. I definitely recommend it.",8,1,3,8 March 2016
Rise of the Guardians," It's gorgeous, it's entertaining, it's fresh. It's a must-see!
","I very much enjoyed watching Rise Of The Guardians. It's a wonderful computer-animated film. It does play like The Avengers (2012) for the kids, but its intelligent story and humor make it a fun time for the whole family. The animation here is gorgeous, surpassing most efforts by Pixar and Disney. And the influence of Japanese animation greats like Spirited Away (2001) is more obvious. The film has an interesting fresh take on each of the five Guardians, who are beautifully designed. When they do battle they have a variety of skills to thrill with. The antagonist, Pitch the Boogeyman, is a complex character just like the Guardians who, it turns out, has some similarities with the protagonist Jack Frost, the Guardian of Fun. The excellent voice cast features Chris Pine, Alec Baldwin, Hugh Jackman, Isla Fisher and Jude Law. Rise Of The Guardians is an entertaining fantasy-adventure by director Peter Ramsey, but it's still a well-meaning film from which children can learn a good deal. The icing on the cake is that it makes excellent use of 3D. I highly recommend watching it, and I won't be surprised if it becomes a holiday classic.",8,7,12,1 December 2012
My Neighbor Totoro," Succeeds as an adventure fueled by the innocence and wonder of a little girl.
","This is a difficult film to pigeonhole. It is apparently simple, made up of the tiny, everyday events in a child's life, but unlike many films for and about children, it doesn't ignore the huge shadows those events cast in the imagination. Some critics have said that not much happens in My Neighbor Totoro, but discovering a new world, learning the cycle of nature, and facing up to the fear of death is more than enough action to sustain a film, especially in director Hayao Miyazaki's hands. The film is, of course, breathtakingly beautiful. The action may be small-scale but the vistas are incredible. Joe Hisaishi creates what may well be his greatest ever score, another miracle of seeming simplicity. In terms of story, design, animation, and music, this film achieves its aims so perfectly that it's almost absurd to give it a rating. Miyazaki set the film in the remembered landscape of his own childhood. Never sentimental, never dishonest, never preaching, and never failing to acknowledge the realities of life, he has made a film with more magic in it than any number of wizards and superheroes could create. The film became so popular that Studio Ghibli adopted Totoro as the company mascot.",9,3,4,21 October 2010
The Prestige," Obsession, jealousy, and deceit define the tense relationship shared between two turn-of-the-century magicians.
","Christopher Nolan directed seven films so far, and The Prestige is his worst one. It's not necessarily bad though. The Prestige is typical Nolan filmmaking. There are no notable performances even though the cast consists of some of the most famous actors working today. Only David Bowie and Hugh Jackman make somewhat of an impression. The film is heavy-going and long. Nolan continues to aim for the noir look, but he can't capture it well in his film projects. So the film ends up being too dark and somber for its own good. The ending is meant to be clever, but with Nolan's direction it doesn't feel that way. Still, it's a solid release overall. There's nothing to distinguish it, however. Like all other films by Nolan it's overrated. He is not a great filmmaker. This is a man who's been influenced by Ridley Scott and the Wachowski brothers. He rarely comes up with anything original, and just continues to copy them. I don't recommend watching The Prestige. The magic tricks here are nothing to get excited about. Nolan erroneously aims for realism, but this approach leaves a bad taste in the mouth. This is far from being anywhere near Steven Spielberg's genius.",7,3,6,13 November 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," A superior sequel that, at the very least, stands shoulder-to-shoulder with its whizbang predecessor.
","The Winter Soldier is another solid entry in Phase Two of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's just as good and, in my opinion, even better than The First Avenger (2011). It's become the norm now that Marvel Studios films are some of the most anticipated blockbusters of the year. All of them have been good. Some people who've seen the film in the theaters have said that The Winter Soldier is the best of the bunch. I think that The Avengers (2012) remains the best Marvel film so far, though The Winter Soldier comes close. One often remembers the exciting action scenes when praising this film. There's a number of action scenes, and all of them are quite memorable. The neat thing about them is that they're as realistic as possible. In my view the film is simply a technological thriller that's meant to be both modern and realistic. Directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo gave this sequel a hi-tech sheen that's different from the steampunk visual approach of Joe Johnston for The First Avenger. The realism is largely due to Captain America himself and his comic book stories. He doesn't possess spectacular powers like the other avengers, so screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely constructed a plot that rotates around politics and characters. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow has her biggest role yet in this film and so does Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury. Actually, the entire film is about S.H.I.E.L.D. and what happens to it. Chris Evans' Steve Rogers plays an important part in what's going on, but it's still only a part. When it comes to Rogers it's mostly the continuation of his adjustment to the modern world. This, however, isn't really interesting because there's not much to it. It is the focus of the film's humor however. Unlike Iron Man 3 (2013) and Thor: The Dark World (2013), The Winter Soldier contains little comedy. It suffers as a result because the political intrigue is, for the most part, not that interesting (at least for me) for a summer blockbuster. Still, thanks to Robert Redford playing the part of Alexander Pierce, this is made bearable. Rogers goes through a believable struggle in the course of the film, and Evans manages to appear vulnerable despite Rogers' strength and skills. The introductions of Sebastian Stan as Winter Soldier and Anthony Mackie as Falcon are exciting bits that reinforce the film's themes of trust and friendship. Guardians Of The Galaxy (2014) and Avengers: Age Of Ultron (2015) will follow The Winter Soldier, yet it already feels like plenty has happened in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This film is a fairly impressive feat. I can argue that the action and the characterization can be improved, but it's still a smart balance of story and action. Like the big majority of blockbusters of recent years it follows the movie formula of Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). I also noticed parts of it that are influenced by Come And See (1985), which is one of my favorite films. The Winter Soldier already earned a lot of money at the box office. I'd recommend it but you've probably already seen it.",8,3,7,19 April 2014
Captain America: The First Avenger," Eye-catching sets, a highly watchable cast, and a brisk action-packed story make this film a treat.
","The film that could have been one of the worst by Marvel Studios instead turned out to be one of the best. Captain America: The First Avenger gets everything right, but the studio hasn't really released a bad film yet. Chris Evans as Steve Rogers is pretty much perfect here. He's believable as someone who goes through a big transformation, but more importantly he's believable as a righteous sickly young man who wants to serve his country. He's transformed into the super soldier Captain America, and he gets a good-looking costume which looks perfect for its era. The 1940s in this film is an optimistic retro-futuristic time that's important in world history. Director Joe Johnston (The Rocketeer, Jumanji) captured that era very well. The talented supporting cast includes Tommy Lee Jones, Hugo Weaving, Hayley Atwell, Sebastian Stan, Dominic Cooper and Stanley Tucci. Jones is great as usual in the role of Colonel Chester Phillips. Tucci gives an interesting performance as the deeply humanistic Dr. Abraham Erskine. And Atwell as the tough Peggy Carter looks just like one of those pin-up girls of the 1940s. Captain America: The First Avenger is an action-packed summer blockbuster, so there isn't a dull moment. One of the highlights is a motorcycle chase reminiscent of the one in Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade (1989). But there's still a good deal of drama, and the film takes an honest look at its hero. Even though the Nazis, or more precisely the terrorist organization HYDRA, have things like laser weapons this still seems perfectly believable. Some people might interpret the film as a piece of American propaganda, but I don't care because it's an exuberant great-looking superhero film. For some reason Captain America has always been one of my favorite superheroes (maybe it's the cool costume and shield), and I'm glad that now there's finally a good film about him. In conclusion, Johnston and cinematographer Shelly Johnson crafted a satisfying colorful adventure film. I recommend seeing it.",8,5,8,24 December 2012
Watchmen," The greatest superhero story ever told.
","Watchmen turned out to be an engrossing film, one definitely worth seeing. I have to say, I wasn't enthusiastic about watching it at first. It's based on the great graphic novel by Alan Moore. It's widely considered to be the best graphic novel ever. Films adapted form great literary works usually don't turn out well. The film also didn't have a big budget. More money was thrown at making Iron Man (2008) and The Dark Knight (2008), for example. This doesn't matter though because Watchmen surpasses all comic book films in terms of professionalism. Zack Snyder is a good action director. Just watch 300 (2007) for proof. With Watchmen he demonstrated that he is just a good director overall. He works well with actors. The acting in the film is almost universally excellent. Everyone gets to shine. Even Malin Akerman had her moments. Not one character feels like a throwaway. All this is further complimented by the good choices in costumes. No one can deny that the heroes in Watchmen look cool. The CGI is excellent too. Be it Doctor Manhattan or Nite Owl's airship, everything looks just right. Snyder staged some truly impressive dramatic scenes. The use of music is inspired. The score by Tyler Bates is obviously fitting, but the choices in songs may surprise some people. I, however, think that the songs are just right. It was good to hear Bob Dylan's 'The Times They Are a-Changing' at the beginning and Leonard Cohen's 'First We Take Manhattan' at the end. What made me like the film even more is its cinematography by Larry Fong. The look of each decade was captured perfectly. The 1980s are somewhat dark in the film's alternate reality though. Nuclear war seems close, and society is sick. To all this is added the sweet look that's also present in the graphic novel. There are many images in Watchmen that are memorable, even unforgettable. There are so many interesting details that I couldn't wait to watch the film more than once to pick up what I missed on first viewing. Thankfully, Snyder didn't change the politics and observations of the graphic novel for the film. Some parts are missing but the endeavour is still a thought-provoking two-and-a-half hours. Plus, it has a clear narrative. This is a comic book film for mature audiences. It stands above other comic book films because it's smart and because it tackles some of the most important issues, even mankind's existence. Watchmen was expertly made, there is a lot to like about it. I respect it and I like it more than any other superhero motion picture. It gets a high recommendation from me.",7,159,238,18 August 2010
American Psycho," A dark and violent satire of America in the 1980s.
","American Psycho the novel remains a controversial piece of literature. Though now it's considered to be a modern classic. American Psycho the film turns out to be much less controversial. That's because just about all the coarse language, sex and torture scenes weren't included. Instead director Mary Harron smartly focused on the novel's black comedy and character study. Christian Bale is fantastic in the lead role. Just watch his confession on the phone at the end of the film for proof. The looks he gives, the way he talks and moves, and his appearance are very good. In my opinion he's not quite the ideal Patrick Bateman but he comes very close. The murder chapters in the novel gave it an edge, made it more memorable. The exclusion of most of these murders from the film made the cinematic endeavour tamed in comparison. Let's face it, what's shown in the film isn't anything new for cinema. There are films that are much more disturbing and bloody than American Psycho. In any case the murders would have been hard and costly to film if they were included. With the film's minor budget and the controversy surrounding the novel these scenes weren't attempted. What surprised me most, however, was that fitting actors were cast in the supporting roles. They looked and acted the way they were supposed to. Reese Witherspoon played the role of Evelyn Williams. Very nice. Harron's direction turns out to be good as well. Most novel to film adaptations are junk, but here the results are quite good. Thankfully, Bateman's 1980s music reviews (Genesis, Whitney Houston, Huey Lewis & The News) were incorporated into a few scenes. Not in their entirety obviously but some of the best parts are there. The film's comedy is very fine. The story's horror elements are what's best though. Bateman has many characteristics of 1980s society and modern society in general. That's what makes him so important; he just represents the extremes of what people think and how they act nowadays. Even if they don't like to admit it many people resemble Bateman in some way. The soundtrack is, for the most part, upbeat. Cinematographer Andrzej Sekula captured the New York scenery that was necessary. It's not an ideal-looking film set in the 1980s but it's not bad. American Psycho the film is not a bad companion piece to the novel. It's an intellectual horror film; one of the best horror films of the last decade in fact. I recommend it.",7,2,3,10 August 2010
Knowing," An action-packed and thought-provoking film.
","Before watching Knowing I thought it would be just another forgettable action-adventure. It turned out to be very intriguing though; a film with a mystery that I eagerly wanted to see solved. I'm not going to explain the mystery, but I will mention that it has both fantasy and science-fiction elements. Nicolas Cage plays the protagonist Professor Jonathan 'John' Koestler. He's a depressed single parent who it seems lives from day to day, and mostly for his son. When he confronts the mystery he realizes that it goes against what he has come to believe. So he is determined to find out what is going on. Some of what follows may seem absurd but it's certainly entertaining. Simon Duggan's cinematography captures some beautiful scenery, especially Koestler's house and the woods surrounding it. The special effects aren't many but they look fine. Knowing is a science-fiction disaster film by director Alex Proyas. Proyas directed the impressive comic book adaptation The Crow in 1994. He also directed one of the best films of the 1990s: the 1998 science-fiction Dark City. Knowing, however, isn't a great film. What happens at the end may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's still one of the most entertaining and absorbing films I've seen lately. I recommend it.",4,4,12,31 July 2010
Ender's Game," A good attempt to adapt a complicated science fiction novel that features thrilling action and impressive visuals.
","I noticed a trend in Hollywood recently. More science fiction films are being released. That's a very good thing because people like science fiction and a representation of a progressive future. In the future of Ender's Game Andrew Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) trains to win the next great war between the human race and an alien species called the Formics. Wiggin is a brilliant misfit with the right balance of killer instincts and compassion. Butterfield delivers a good performance but, most importantly, makes his character sympathetic. His performance gives the film some much needed soul. He had also done admirable work when he played Hugo Cabret in Hugo (2011). Hailee Steinfeld, playing Petra Arkanian, is another standout in the cast. Her scenes with Butterfield in Battle School are exciting. The simulated war games in an impressive zero-gravity training room could have dragged, but director Gavin Hood managed to make these scenes some of the most entertaining in the film. Hood should also be commended for making an efficient film from a weak screenplay. The film isn't really inspired but with a $110 million budget and a good cast it works surprisingly well. The generally excellent special effects create a visually interesting future world both in space and on Earth. Wiggin's scenes with his sister Valentine (Abigail Breslin) are handled well too. It's in the performances of the adult actors where the screenplay clearly shows its weakness. Viola Davis, playing Gwen Anderson, has little to do except look worried while Wiggin deals with one challenge after another. Harrison Ford, playing Hyrum Graff, brings his usual authority to his role but awkwardly alternates between caring and uncaring. Still, the film wins in terms of adapting the very complicated novel by Orson Scott Card. It doesn't have the same emotional impact as the novel though. Ender's Game isn't only for a young audience because it doesn't whitewash politics and war. Adults will enjoy this futuristic action film too. I recommend it.",6,1,3,11 November 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," A reboot which is considerably worse than Sam Raimi's films.
","Does The Amazing Spider-Man disappoint? Not while you're watching it for the first time because it keeps you entertained. But this is a generic superhero film. There's nothing here to really get excited about. The screenplay was written by three people and the director is Marc Webb (500 Days Of Summer), but their efforts don't impress. Webb was not the right man for this project. He does include his neat directorial style but in this film it's uninspired. It's clear that the people involved made this film just to make money because it's uninspired on all fronts. Webb did not get along very well with the actors. With better direction Andrew Garfield may have been able to carry this film but on his own he doesn't have the chops. I understand what he tried to do with his character, though in a role which makes Peter Parker seem truly selfish his acting bits weren't beneficial. Even the supporting cast were not good. I guess I can only praise Emma Stone because she looked good and because she tried. But just like with every other actor here her performance was just passable. On the acting front there's nothing to discuss in this film. Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors, the villain of the picture, isn't memorable. When he's the Lizard, however, he is sometimes genuinely frightening. The CGI and the action too are disappointing for the most part. In conclusion, The Amazing Spider-Man is just passable. It's flawed, which is especially noticeable on second viewing, and I don't recommend seeing it.",5,2,6,31 August 2012
X-Men: Days of Future Past," This deftly scripted and unusually affecting film is truly memorable.
","X-Men: Days Of Future Past marks the end of an era. The cast that people got used to over the last 15 years makes its final appearance. It's a bit sad to see actors like Patrick Stewart (Professor X) and Ian McKellen (Magneto) go because they were so charismatic in their roles. In this film too they show their excellent acting abilities. It's actually nice to see familiar faces return. Halle Berry (Storm), Shawn Ashmore (Iceman) and Daniel Cudmore (Colossus) took part in the action, while others returned to nicely conclude everything at the end. Days Of Future Past is a sequel to both The Last Stand (2006) and First Class (2011). The satisfying ending isn't the only thing that director Bryan Singer was thorough with. This sequel has been called the best X-Men film yet by some reviewers. My opinion is that First Class is the best X-Men film so far, but Days Of Future Past is just about as good. But let's not forget about X2 (2003), which is another worthy contender for the best X-Men film. I'm not someone who likes the X-Men films much. I think that none of them have been perfect so far. They all have something that prevents them from being great films or some of the best superhero films. They're first and foremost blockbusters that are meant to entertain. Some scenes in Days Of Future Past can be seen again and again, especially the spectacular opening sequence that introduces a nightmarish new threat. In terms of action Singer is at the top of his game here. The tone is softened after the incredibly grim introduction. Some may think this wise, but once Wolverine is in the past the film loses momentum, introduces characters that aren't very interesting, humor that isn't very funny, action that isn't very exciting, and details that aren't very clever. Some people may think that Magneto's connection to the JFK assassination was clever but, in my opinion, it was handled poorly by Singer and screenwriter Simon Kinberg. The film slows down noticeably in the middle. This minor problem is what prevents me from giving Days Of Future Past a very good rating. What happens at the end though is just as interesting and entertaining as what happens at the beginning. The action is terrific and John Ottman's good score is used to great effect. Days Of Future Past is a long film, with 131 minutes of running time. Still, considering its epic time-traveling story and its many characters I can say that Singer and Kinberg succeeded in making the film satisfying. Much of the cast can be applauded for their efforts. Stewart and McKellen, as I mentioned before, are excellent as usual in their roles. Hugh Jackman is as reliable as always as Wolverine. Many people forget that Jackman is a good actor. He proved it in films like The Fountain (2006) and Prisoners (2013) and even in schlock like Kate & Leopold (2001) and Van Helsing (2004). Jennifer Lawrence, playing Mystique, is fine in her role but nothing special in my opinion. When she's covered with blue paint she's not as menacing or as sexy as Rebecca Romijn was in the role. Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy get to impress only at the end of the film. Before that there's really nothing to write about concerning their acting. They're clearly not as charismatic as they were in First Class. In fact, McAvoy simply annoyed me while he was doing his depressed Charles Xavier bit. His acting, thankfully, improved when Xavier tried to convince Mystique to abandon the course that she was on. The only other thing that I have to add about Days Of Future Past is that it doesn't contain as much establishment propaganda as First Class. In First Class it was just obvious. 'Mutant and proud' was clearly a metaphor for 'gay and proud.' In case you didn't know, I'll mention that for the Anglo-American establishment pro-gay propaganda is very important. It's one of their tactics to reduce human population on the planet because they think that there's way too many people now. So being fine with homosexuality and not having children is what the ruling class wants for the lower classes. Globalization is another thing that's very important for the establishment. The story takes place in different countries and there's also an international cast involved. In Days Of Future Past, the Russians and the Chinese are mentioned as enemies that are more dangerous than the mutants. This also fits into the establishment line. Russia and China are the main enemies for the ruling class of Britain and the USA. North Korea gets most of the hate these days, but China and especially Russia aren't far behind. Other than what I've mentioned there's really nothing to complain about. The visual effects, especially the Sentinels, are mostly impressive and so are the designs. Days Of Future Past suffers because of the plethora of characters. Not all of the key players are given satisfying story arcs, but I still recommend this epic yet entertaining film.",8,3,4,27 June 2014
Wreck-It Ralph," Wreck-It Ralph is a familiar story for children, but it's still a colorful adventure film.
","Wreck-It Ralph is a film for children though even adults will enjoy it because of its smart humor and clever references to the arcade. The story is simple, with Wreck-It Ralph representing adults with a mid-life crisis and Vanellope von Schweetz representing children outside of the pack. The film starts slow but it builds to a thrilling ending which can easily compel viewers to see it again. The influence of Japanese animation on the story and the animation is obvious. One of the songs on the soundtrack is Sugar Rush by the Japanese girl group AKB48. Another nice tune in the film is When Can I See You Again? by Owl City. An excellent voice cast was assembled to bring the likable characters to life, including John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman, Jack McBrayer, Jane Lynch and Alan Tudyk. Wreck-It Ralph was produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and not by Pixar. It doesn't reach the level of excellence of Pixar's best releases but it's still better than Pixar's worst, and even Pixar's worst are quite good. In conclusion Wreck-It Ralph, by director Rich Moore, is a good piece of entertainment, however I have to mention that it doesn't make good use of 3D. It's the 52nd animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series. I recommend seeing it.",7,3,3,6 December 2012
Bridesmaids," Truly a funny film which follows in the footsteps of The Hangover.
","For those wondering if this comedy delivers the laughs the answer is yes it does. The humor keeps on coming, and this is perhaps the funniest film I've seen in the theaters this year. The setups are actually good, and almost every scene ends up being funny. I have to mention that this isn't a romantic comedy though there is some romance on the side. Apart from the bridesmaids I thought that the characters weren't well developed. The film is often raunchy but it has a sense of realism that's believable. Bridesmaids is similar to The Hangover (2009) and other films that followed. The difference is that this film stays true to life with scenes conveying different emotions that are very believable. In this sense the characterization is some of the best that I've seen in comedies. The film mirrors modern society very well, and it doesn't hide from weird and harsh realities. Kristen Wiig is fantastic in the lead role. Like I mentioned before, however, the supporting characters aren't the film's strength and scenes between Wiig and Chris O'Dowd were not something that I enjoyed. The scenes with the bridesmaids on the other hand were very enjoyable. To sum up Bridesmaids is an original, touching and enjoyable film. I definitely recommend seeing it.",6,4,8,2 June 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A fantastic return to Middle-earth.
","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a fine return to form for director Peter Jackson. Guillermo del Toro, who's one of the writers for the film, was initially supposed to direct but he left the project in May of 2010. If this first film in the new fantasy trilogy is a sign of what's to come I certainly look forward to seeing The Desolation Of Smaug and There And Back Again. As Gandalf the Grey says at the beginning of the film this is an adventure. Ian McKellen is just as good as ever in his role as the wizard. Maybe he's even better than before since I found his character more likable. While watching the film I didn't at all doubt that he is Gandalf. Martin Freeman is excellent as well in the role of Bilbo Baggins. He does well with his character's insecurity and the humor, which comes often in the course of the film. At first Bilbo is clearly reluctant to get involved in the adventure but after everything that happens he manages to prove his importance to the company. The company of dwarfs is well realized, just like everything else. Richard Armitage expresses authority as Thorin Oakenshield. Every dwarf has a distinct look and personality. The special effects are impressive too. The Lord Of The Rings trilogy has special effects that look good even now but in The Hobbit it's clear from the beginning that CGI improved in ten years. The look of every creature is impressive and even terrifying. This is especially noticeable with Gollum (Andy Serkis), who now looks completely realistic. Some people questioned Jackson's decision to make a trilogy out of one book, expressing that there's not enough material for this. It's not really a problem however. In Jackson's hands the film doesn't lose steam until the very end and the grandeur is still there, made clear from the very begging when Bilbo describes Thror's rule of the Lonely Mountain. The running time is 169 minutes but it seems much shorter because there isn't really a dull moment. Like I mentioned before the acting is impressive. Of note is Sylvester McCoy's appearance as Radagast the Brown. The Hobbit doesn't have the sense of drama of The Lord Of The Rings trilogy yet it's a perfect prequel. I recommend it.",7,3,7,13 February 2013
Django Unchained," Django Unchained certainly isn't a masterpiece but it's bold and funny for sure.
","I'm a cinephile but I wasn't looking forward to seeing Django Unchained. Still, since I had some time, I went to the theater where the film was being screened. Django Unchained is a long film. Its running time is 165 minutes. Some people say that Quentin Tarantino is a great filmmaker, so he must have filled this project with meat. But no. There's just not enough meat here to justify the long running time. Instead there's fat and plenty of it. After Inglourious Basterds (2009), which is one of his best films, Tarantino wanted to make a spaghetti western. But he wanted the setting to be the Deep South before the Civil War. So he called his project a 'Southern.' He's not the first filmmaker to twist the word. Russian filmmakers made Western-like films as far back as the 1960s. They called them 'Easterns' or 'Osterns.' One of the best films from that genre is White Sun Of The Desert (1970). Tarantino also said that he wanted to tackle the issue of slavery in the United States because America hasn't dealt with it well. The plot of Django Unchained is a simple one. Tarantino doesn't shy away from showing some of the worst abuses that happened as a result of slavery. But he still keeps things entertaining. The actors deliver good performances, especially Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson. The film contains some of Tarantino's best written dialogue. The gunfights are some of the best ever committed to film. Despite all this the film is still, for the most part, a stylistic failure. For such a simple story it's too long and there are a number of scenes which serve no purpose. Tarantino gets good performances from the actors but his direction doesn't impress because he didn't do a good job at building scenes. He's known for including things that he likes in his films. Here he goes too far by including too many of his influences and too many songs that aren't really suitable for the material. Tarantino's previous editor Sally Menke knew how to cut his footage for a good result and when to reign him in. But now that Fred Raskin is the editor the film doesn't seem like the work of a great director. So, even though the cinematography by Robert Richardson is beautiful and even though the film is entertaining we still get something that seems average but bloody as well. With better direction and better editing it could have been a great film. Django Unchained is also Tarantino's funniest film yet. I recommend it but my recommendation isn't enthusiastic.",6,3,10,10 February 2013
The Lives of Others," An interesting character study with excellent performances.
","West German director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck crafted an engaging drama in The Lives Of Others, his first feature film. At the center of this film is the impressive performance by Ulrich Muhe as Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler, an officer of the Stasi. Wiesler is an efficient and loyal employee who goes through changes he didn't expect. After listening in on Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck) and Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), two fine artists whose lifestyle is different from his he begins to doubt his work. In addition to the excellent performances from the cast and Donnersmarck's effective direction the film is aided by Hagen Bogdanski's expert cinematography. Some reviewers stressed the feeling of paranoia in The Lives Of Others but my opinion is that instead the film amplifies the relationships that all people have every day. By picking these characters Donnersmarck stresses humanity. This approach leads to a satisfying emotional ending. While The Lives Of Others is a very good piece of filmmaking it's certainly not a history lesson. The German Democratic Republic was perhaps the state with the most surveillance in the Eastern Bloc but even there there were only a few Wieslers and personal or even erotic motifs played a somewhat subordinate role in the musty atmosphere of East German socialism. The film is not an accurate presentation of life in the Eastern Bloc, and it was intentionally made to look gray. Another factor is the film's Best Picture win at the 2006 Academy Awards, which by the way is a tentacle of American propaganda. The film that should have won was Pan's Labyrinth, but instead The Lives Of Others was picked for ideological reasons. Despite these obvious flaws and problems The Lives Of Others is still one of the best German films of recent years, and internationally it grossed an impressive $77 million.",9,4,5,13 November 2012
The Bourne Legacy," A worthy addition to the franchise. It's worth seeing for the performances by the two leads.
","The Bourne Legacy is a competent action thriller which adds to the trilogy of films made famous by Matt Damon. Obviously Damon isn't in this film so instead Jeremy Renner plays the part of Aaron Cross, a member of an American black ops program. Renner is very good here, and he manages to make Cross into an appealing character. Not only does Renner add a human touch but he is also physically fit so he did most of the stunts himself. Rachel Weisz, as Dr. Marta Shearing, was paired with him for most of the film. Her work is important for Cross. Oscar-winner Weisz was quickly cast for the role of Shearing, and like Renner she's very good here. She's believable as someone who's been thrown into a difficult situation. Edward Norton is another famous name in the cast. He plays Eric Byer, the antagonist of the film and Cross's former boss. The acting in The Bourne Legacy is certainly worthy of praise, especially the performances by Renner and Weisz. What harms the film, however, is the direction by Tony Gilroy. This is a bit strange because Gilroy is an excellent director. His filmography includes Michael Clayton (2007) and State Of Play (2009). He was also the writer for the previous Bourne films. His direction for this film is assured though he didn't do a good job with the action pieces. Most of the action is definitely exciting, but a few scenes were clearly not edited well. Still, the story is interesting. Gilroy is clearly aware of how things are really done in intelligence and the military. While faulty The Bourne Legacy is a film worth seeing. In some aspects I enjoyed it even more than the previous Bourne films.",6,12,20,19 September 2012
Hero," Wuxia films don't get better than this.
","Hero is one of the most stunning martial arts epics ever. I was somewhat disappointed by recent releases like Curse Of The Golden Flower (2006) and House Of Flying Daggers (2004). That's not to say that they were bad because they were filmed well and were sometimes thrilling. But their stories didn't pull me in. Hero, however, is a triumph. It really touched me with its story of revenge, war, politics and devotion. The first thing I noticed while watching it was its superb use of color. The cinematography is gorgeous, and often scenes are dominated by only one color. China rarely looks this good in films. The martial arts fights are elevated to graceful and artful. The backdrops of these fights are stunning. The fights obviously have elements of fantasy. Thus, even special effects were used. None of them look fake, however. Even the fight on a lake was filmed without errors or missteps. In the acting category famous actors from Hong Kong were cast as the assassins. It was good to see them in one film. They're middle-aged now but this is fitting because they play wise and experienced fighters. The real surprise is Chen Daoming, playing the King of Qin. He's a tyrant but Daoming turns him into a likable persona, just what the film requires. He hardly moves during the film, but just the way he talks is interesting. The film's message is definitely thought-provoking. Hero is one of the most expensive films in Chinese history, and also the highest-grossing. There are many extras, big imposing architecture, and incredible martial arts fights. It's definitely a must-see film, one of the best martial arts films ever. I highly recommend it.",9,2,3,31 July 2010
The Hurt Locker," An engrossing film that takes one's breath away.
","Here we have one of the best films of the last decade. A war film that succeeds in showing what it's like to be in the armed forces nowadays. It was directed be the underrated Kathryn Bigelow. The focus is on American soldiers in the Iraq war. But it's not about them being involved in assaults or shootouts. Instead we're shown the lives of a bomb squad. Jeremy Renner is commanding as Sergeant First Class William James. He provides an excellent performance. So do Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty as his partners. They really do act like real soldiers. The Hurt Locker consists of a series of bomb threats that the team have to overcome. These are all thrilling, tense. What makes the film really shine, however, is its anti-war messages. In the tradition of Apocalypse Now (1979) and Come And See (1985) The Hurt Locker shows that people get hurt and killed in wars, even if they don't deserve it. It shows that the victims are just like anyone else except that they're in a war zone. The film doesn't directly criticize the American war effort. There are no discussions about whether the Iraq war is moral or immoral. Bigelow's direction is truly impressive. She certainly knows how to work with actors. The acting is obviously superb, and this is the film's greatest strength. Also notable is the cinematography by Barry Ackroyd. The war hasn't looked this realistic or this interesting in cinema until The Hurt Locker. The images captured are thoughtful and memorable. No wonder the film was the big winner at the 2010 Academy Awards. Some films that win Best Picture don't deserve it, but The Hurt Locker sure did deserve it. It's one of the best war films ever, and I highly recommend it.",9,262,403,12 August 2010
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," This impressive work from acclaimed Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki represents a significant departure from traditional anime.
","Nausicaa Of The Valley Of The Wind is an epic science-fiction story that ranks among director Hayao Miyazaki's best works. It's based on one section of his classic manga. The film is beautiful, and the heroine is convincingly human. The narrative is action-packed, with a world that is wonderfully realized. All the characters are well drawn. This is due to Miyazaki's commitment to the project, and because the film was made before the foundation of Studio Ghibli so the director was able to pick up the best staff available at the time. The result is an impressive technical achievement. The script is another of the film's strengths, overflowing with excitement and passion. Joe Hisaishi's symphonic score sounds marvelous in addition to all this. Whether you choose to ponder its various messages or be swept away by its adventure and sense of the fantastic, Nausicaa Of The Valley Of The Wind is a science-fiction classic.",9,2,3,5 October 2010
Lincoln," An informing look at Abraham Lincoln's final days that's elevated by excellent performances.
","Lincoln is Steven Spielberg's best film since Munich (2005). For Lincoln he assembled a terrific cast, one of the best ever. The film is full of dialogue, a result of Tony Kushner's rich screenplay. Because of this Lincoln doesn't even seems like one of Spielberg's films. It doesn't have his typical thrills and action. In fact, it seems very much like a theater play. Daniel Day-Lewis's impressive performance was singled out by some critics as one worthy of a Best Actor Academy Award, but Day-Lewis is only the first among equals here. Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens, a fervent abolitionist, has some of the best lines in the film. Sally Field as the grieving Mary Todd Lincoln is at the center of the film's dramatic subplot. Both Jones and Field deserve an Academy Award for their performances. James Spader as Republican Party operative William N. Bilbo steals every scene he's in. Other famous names in the cast include David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, Jackie Earle Haley, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Jared Harris. Day-Lewis made his Lincoln a fully-realized and likable character. When he's talking one can't help but listen to his every word. The film covers the final four months of Abraham Lincoln's life, focusing on his efforts in January 1865 to have the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution pass the United States House of Representatives. Slavery and war are the two issues here. It's made clear that it took a lot of effort to abolish slavery in the United States. The film presents arguments in favor and against slavery, though it's not a detailed look at American politics of that time. In addition, it seems like an idealized look at American politics. The Civil War was a war between the industrial North against the agrarian South. Seeing Lincoln is really like a trip back in time because the sets and the costumes are very good. In conclusion, the film is easily worth recommending.",8,4,10,6 December 2012
Grave of the Fireflies," Grave Of The Fireflies is one of the very best anime films there is.
","Grave Of The Fireflies (directed by Isao Takahata) is one of the true classics of anime. Along with Spirited Away it's my favourite film by Studio Ghibli. Even though the film is an anime it's different from anything that's typically associated with the medium. There is no 'end of the world' scenario here, or characters with big eyes and coloured hair, or plenty of slapstick humour. Instead, what Grave Of The Fireflies offers is a believable drama set during the second World War. Near the end of the war a boy named Seita and his five-year-old sister Setsuko have been made homeless because their mother was killed and their house was burned down during the firebombing in Kobe. Their father is in service to the Japanese Imperial Navy, but he was probably killed in action. Eventually the children find themselves in a grim situation. They have to live outside, and food is very hard to come by as a result of the widespread famine. Seita tries everything he can to acquire food for himself and his little sister. We get to see their struggle, and how they try to stay positive during this difficult time. The story is focused on the two children. There's hardly any discussion about Japan's war with America. In fact, I think the Americans aren't even mentioned in the dialogue. As is to be expected from a Ghibli film the animation in Grave Of The Fireflies is top rate. The music is effective. It helps make some scenes very moving. Some famous baroque and classical pieces by composers like Bach, Handel, Vivaldi, Mozart and Boccherini were included too. Appropriately aged children were cast in the roles of Seita and Setsuko. Some anime reviewers have named Grave Of The Fireflies the greatest anime there is. Having seen the film I understand why they'd say that. Before watching the film I heard that it makes viewers cry because it's very moving. I didn't cry, but that's because I tried very hard not to. After that I still had to blow my nose. Film critic Roger Ebert considers Grave Of The Fireflies to be one of the most powerful anti-war movies ever made. He included the film in his Great Movies list. The AllMovie guide awarded the film a rating of 5 out of 5 stars. The only other anime films to earn the perfect rating are Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away and Akira. I don't really care about ratings, but this is one of the few anime films that deserves the hype.",10,7,8,13 October 2010
Mama," An impressive debut by Andres Muschietti. It's a spooky and intelligent horror film.
","Mama is the best horror film I've seen in a while. It works thanks to the efforts of director and ambitious newcomer Andres Muschietti. Another reason why the film works is because it was produced by the visionary Guillermo del Toro. Barbara Muschietti, the director's sister, was also a producer. The scares here are a product of the mother's attachment to the children, and this theme works well in the context of the film. The mother in question is certainly a frightening creation. While there are jump scares the majority of the horror involves tension and mystery. This makes Mama seem similar to Gore Verbinski's The Ring (2002). The cinematography of The Ring is dominated by the colors blue and green. Antonio Riestra's beautiful cinematography for Mama is dominated by brown and black. All this makes the film an interesting chiller, and I enjoyed the atmosphere as much as I enjoyed the story. In the end though it's not easy to feel sympathy for the mother. Some scenes show to the audience that she's a sympathetic character, but she's still too scary and her acts too gruesome to make her really sympathetic. Another quirk is that the acting isn't always suitable, so even critics' darling Jessica Chastain doesn't always deliver with Muschietti's direction. One of the influences on Mama was obviously the Japanese horror genre. The best releases from that genre ended before the mid-2000s, but Mama shows that elements from it can still be effective. All in all it's an engaging horror film, and I recommend seeing it.",6,2,5,31 January 2013
Sinister," It's a meandering pointless story full of horror clichés.
","While Sinister does offer enough scares I found it to be a lack luster affair. When I was going to see this film I didn't know what to expect. When I was watching it I have to admit that it put my nerves on edge. Unfortunately, it doesn't do this in any innovative way. Sinister relies too much on jump scares, and consists of Ethan Hawke as Ellison Oswalt interacting with things like a laptop and a supernatural projector. There are supporting characters but they're often nothing more than plot devices. At one point Vincent D'Onofrio pops in as Professor Jonas only via iChat to provide more info about the baddie. One has to give Hawke some credit because he does deliver a good performance as a frightened family man, but it's just silly when the demon Bughuul (a.k.a. Mr. Boogie) looks like a member of a heavy metal band. In the end we still get to know almost nothing about this Pagan deity and he has very little screen time. It's clear that Sinister was heavily influenced by the Japanese horror genre and Paranormal Activity (2007). It features a silly conspiracy involving Super 8 footage, several children and the demon baddie. Because the film aims so much to shock you with a minimal plot you have to watch scenes which make no sense. Director Scott Derrickson made it a thing to show doors being closed and the projector being turned on again and again. It seems that some moviegoers consider Sinister a good horror film because it gave them a difficult time. Unfortunately, when you're done watching it and look back on it you can't help but notice the unexplained and the silliness. The film should have been more serious. As a horror flick it's passable but I don't recommend watching it.",4,51,81,22 October 2012
Eyes Wide Shut," The final work of legendary director Stanley Kubrick.
","Stanley Kubrick's detractors used his showmanship as a criticism of his films, claiming that they were only simple stories writ portentously and pompously large, all form and no substance. And these detractors were never so merciless - or so numerous - as they were with his final film, Eyes Wide Shut, which was released posthumously in the summer of 1998. The incentive came fast and furious. The film was too slow. Its vision of New York was hopelessly out of touch. It was misogynist. It was ugly. Its notion of sexuality was old-fashioned. It was unfinished. The rumours were dished out to a public that finally had no use for this most intimate and nakedly emotional of Kubrick's films. Eyes Wide Shut is the story of a young Manhattan doctor (Tom Cruise) who uses his wife's (Nicole Kidman) spontaneous confession of past unrequited desire for another man as license to explore his own desires, only to encounter an endless series of prohibitions and frustrations. For those who went to Kubrick's film with their eyes wide open, it is one of his greatest films, composed and enacted in dream logic, set in the ravishing tones of fin-de-siecle Viennese painting. Kubrick uses his two dedicated superstars to dig deep into uncomfortable emotional issues. He may have lived in England for the last 35 years of his life, and he may have been a towering artist, but Kubrick was also the last of the great American showmen. He knew how to deliver a total experience. Like most of his work, Eyes Wide Shut will make the shift to classic status.",8,2,3,10 November 2010
Thor," The fourth Marvel Studios film is another triumph that's witty, dramatic and entertaining.
","Thor was one of two films by Marvel Studios released during the summer of 2011, the other being Captain America: The First Avenger. Both Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Captain America (Chris Evans) appeared in The Avengers (2012), a film that I initially didn't like much but after some time have grown to appreciate. The Avengers is a superb superhero film, one of the best of all time in fact. In Thor the best performance is by Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Tom again played Loki as the main villain in The Avengers. Loki is clearly up to no good but Hiddleston managed to show that he's a complex sympathetic character. Hemsworth was a good choice to play Thor, the crown prince of Asgard. With his dirty blond hair and ridiculously chiseled physique Hemsworth has plenty of charisma as Thor. The humor is frequent here and so is the action. The CGI was put to good use, and the realization of Asgard and the Bifrost is especially impressive. Still, the center of the film is the relation between Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and his two sons. Director Kenneth Branagh was a good choice to tell this drama reminiscent of a play by William Shakespeare. Hopkins is a commanding presence as Odin, so his is another standout performance. But really, all the actors deliver here. There's Sif (Jaimie Alexander) and the Warriors Three, there's Heimdall (Idris Elba), and there's Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). The love story is a bit rushed since Thor and Jane fall in love by the fire with a starry night sky behind them. The pacing too isn't perfect but Thor is a thrilling film which can improve just about anyone's mood. Patrick Doyle delivered a good score, and the Foo Fighters song Walk was also included in the film. In conclusion, there's much to like in Thor and I highly recommend seeing it.",7,2,4,23 December 2012
Castle in the Sky," One of the best and most successful early anime films.
","Castle In The Sky produces more wonder and perhaps more excitement than any other film directed by Hayao Miyazaki. It's not his best film, but it's a wonderful early Studio Ghibli effort. Industrial Age Europe was obviously an inspiration on the world of the film. There are elements of the fantastic, like the sky castle itself. The castle was part of a utopia created by an advanced civilization through technology. Miyazaki's animation style presents this world vividly and wonderfully. There is some truly breathtaking scenery. Compared to today's anime, especially by Ghibli, the animation of Castle In The Sky looks crude. This is hardly a distraction though. Until Akira (1988) there were very few big budget anime films. There was also a lack of good talent. What raises Castle In The Sky above average is its design and creativity. It helped that Joe Hisaishi composed an effective score that sounds enchanting in the film. Sheeta, a girl, is the heroine of the story. She meets Pazu, a boy who quickly becomes her best friend. They're good, courageous children. For a Miyazaki film there is a surprisingly large amount of action, producing much excitement. The children are almost always on the move. Sheeta's levistone pendant represents advanced technology, something that saves her again and again. The story isn't very original, but there's still a lot to like here. I highly recommend seeing Castle In The Sky. It's a film that one can treasure.",8,2,3,20 August 2010
The Fountain," A man's thousand-year quest to save the woman he loves.
","The Fountain is a good example of why, I think, Darren Aronofsky is one of the best directors working in Hollywood today. I guess it was something of a pet project of his. The film doesn't have a clear narrative. Instead it features three stories that tackle the themes of life and death. Russian and Asian influences are evident in these stories. The special effects are spectacular, but the film's greatest strength is the acting. Both Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz provide excellent performances. The Fountain is an unusual film so it's not meant to be entertaining. Still, it's an absorbing fantasy drama that shows what cinema is capable of nowadays. Some of the film's scenes are simply stunning. Love is rarely portrayed this well on the big screen. The Fountain already has a cult following because it's one of the most daring films of recent years. I'm thinking that film buffs will enjoy it more than the average moviegoer. I highly recommend The Fountain.",8,3,6,12 August 2010
Enemy at the Gates," Enemy At The Gates is a film that's overflowing with anti-Communism. I hate it.
","French film director Jean-Jacques Annaud should be ashamed of this film. I know there's plenty of anti-Communism in the French media, but this is going too far. He managed to make a misleading film about the most important battle of the 20th century, and then he put it into wide release so that as many people as possible would watch it. The amount of bias and misrepresentation in this film is astonishing. Here's a list of some of the things that are wrong with it:<ul><li>the Western actors playing Russians don't behave or talk like Russians. - Russian soldiers were not brought to the front line in cattle trucks like Jews being sent off to German concentration camps. - the Russians did not mount suicide charges against the Germans, but fought them house to house. - Nikita Khrushchev (played by Bob Hoskins) was not a murderous old fatso. This is 1942 we're talking about, not 1962. At that time he was much younger and slimmer. - the toothless Koulikov was included in the film just to make people think that Stalin has people tortured. And maybe to show off Konig's sniping skills. - Russian soldiers were not hooligans who made out, drank vodka, and play farting games at night. They instead tried to get as much sleep as they could during the battle. - the morale of the Red Army did not depend on Zaitsev's sniping successes. - Danilov was included in the film mostly to show that there were political commissars in the Soviet Union. In reality the commissars were excluded from the army during the war. - there were no huge statues of Joseph Stalin everywhere in Stalingrad. - huge portraits of Stalin didn't hang in the Red Army headquarters. - it was the Russians who played the speech mentioning that every 7 seconds a German soldier dies in Russia. This was done when the Germans were close to defeat. - the Red Army did not offer lavish banquets to heroes like Zaitsev. The man stealing the fruit from the table was included just to make people think that there's inequality in the Soviet Union. - before he gets killed, Danilov makes a speech. What's it about? It's an anti-Communist speech. - the film includes sniper duels that don't take place in real life. - Stalingrad is the bloodiest battle in human history, but in this film you don't get to understand the scale of the battle at all. - while watching Enemy At The Gates I got the impression that more Red Army soldiers were killed by their superiors than by the Germans. The film falsely shows Red Army officers killing their soldiers left and right because of cowardice. - the Russians were not short on rifles during this battle. Russians had all the equipment they needed in this battle. - Konig's fantastic shooting isn't possible in real life. - the 'sniper's duel' shown in the film is fictional. The real duel between Zaitsev and Konig was different.</li></ul>Watching this film viewers may easily think that it's the invading Germans and not the Russian defenders who are the good guys. It's certain that the director is fond of the Germans, and that he's anti-Communist. While reading the comments here it became clear to me that most viewers take this film seriously. Because they don't know better they'll be left thinking that this is how Russians behave and that this is what the war was like. This sort of film-making is really unprofessional. The director should have at least done some research and watched some Russian films before filming the dreadful Enemy At The Gates. Also, he should have put aside his political views.",4,9,16,6 July 2010
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Michael Bay is killing the art of film-making.
","A YouTube video can have more meaning than this second epic film in director Michael Bay's Transformers series. This isn't even the worst of it. $200 million was spent on making Revenge Of The Fallen, and it made 836 million green ones at the box-office. I was wise enough to avoid seeing it in a movie theater, but I still felt ripped off after watching it at home. If this is the sort of film that passes as a big money-making machine these days then what is the world coming to? As an experience the film leaves one feeling tired, but it still has its good points. The CGI is often amazing though sometimes it takes effort to figure out which transformer you're looking at. Bay is, no doubt, a very good director of visuals. He can direct actors towards good performances too. I will say that Shia LaBeouf does a good job playing Sam Witwicky. The script hurts the film for sure, and makes it like a cartoon. Things could have been good if the dialogue was more thoughtful and if the pacing was better. As it stands Revenge Of The Fallen is somewhat of a mess. If only the juvenile humor had been kept out. Some people criticized Megan Fox, but I say why? It's not like the other actors in the film did much better. She's just there to represent a piece of good ole suburban American ass. At least SHE called Michael Bay Hitler. Yeah, the film could have been better (perhaps much better) if the Bayness wasn't so plentiful. So, for every impressive battle featuring the mighty Optimus Prime there is a lame attempt at humor featuring a small transformer with a machine gun for a penis. I don't recommend seeing Revenge Of The Fallen, but children will probably enjoy it.",7,1,7,12 July 2011
Jaws," Jaws became a cultural phenomenon and the first bona fide summer event film.
","Television had taught director Steven Spielberg to grab the audience in the opening sequence, but Duel (1971) had shown him that our fear of the unseen dictates that our direct confrontation with the giant shark should be delayed. Spielberg's brilliantly edited and scored film unfolds in three classically conceived acts. The film carefully balances suspense and humour, provides the police chief with a believable home life, creates credible characters in Brody (Roy Scheider) and Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), and something controversially legendary in Quint (Robert Shaw). Several things give the film an extra dimension. First, the picture came out in the immediate aftermath of the Watergate scandal, the biggest cover-up and public deception in American political history, and playing the craven Mayor of Amity is Murray Hamilton, an actor associated with devious authority figures, most famously Mr. Robinson in The Graduate (1967). The second is the teaming of a uniformed policeman and a bearded hippie as the principled opponents of a dishonest community. The third factor, the one that gives true depth to Jaws, is the revelation that Quint was a survivor of the Indianapolis, the American warship torpedoed in July 1945 after delivering the A-bomb to be dropped on Hiroshima. As he eloquently recalls, nearly 800 sailors out of a crew of 1100 perished while clinging to wreckage, most killed by sharks. The thriller is many things: a high point in the 1970s group-jeopardy cycle; a Hitchcockian horror picture for the carriage trade; the massive box-office hit that established the reputation of Spielberg; and the film that created a new fashion for releasing films nationally with several thousand prints.",10,5,11,15 November 2010
Inception," Prepare to be disappointed.
","Inception is a failure and a disappointment. It's mostly an excuse to include action sequences that, it turns out, the story doesn't require. The film's trailer looked and sounded better that the film itself. The film is ambitious but in director Christopher Nolan's hands it just doesn't work. Like in his Batman films Nolan spends too much time on showing the preparations before the main course; in this case it's finding the team members, explaining what they do, and then what should be done. When all this starts to seem boring and unbelievable an action scene is included. On top of this the film's concept seems phoney. It's never really explained how several people can enter the one dream. In this case the audience has to abandon reason and just go along with it. Even so, the film still doesn't deliver. I didn't like most of the team members because they weren't necessary and because the actors were miscast. I only liked Leonardo DiCaprio's Dom Cobb and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Arthur. Except for these two there weren't any good performances. Scenes that were supposed to be filled with emotion or grandeur fall flat, for the most part. Ellen Page's Ariadne is the architect. She's shown working on paper models of buildings, but then the team enters the dream world that she designed - and WOW - it's a fully-realized city with countless details. Fantasy is absent from these dreams though. You won't find Godzilla there somewhere, but you will find several gunmen. Except for a few instances, attempts at deep meaning and characterization don't work. The film is also long; it goes on and on and doesn't entertain. The second half is comprised mostly of one action scene after another, and most of these are just shootouts.There's a lot that's wrong with Inception, but some things in it are sort of right. It works as a noir thriller. The cinematography is quite good. Two parts of the film that I most looked forward to seeing were a little impressive. One is when Arthur fights against a few gunmen in the hallway of a building while the center of gravity keeps changing. This was a good idea for a fight, but the fight lasts for like a minute. It's also not as impressive as the Batpod scene from The Dark Knight (2008). The second part that I liked was the dream world that Cobb and his wife Mallorie designed for themselves. That city was definitely awe-inspiring. Too little time was spent there too, however. Nolan should be given credit for trying something new but very little of it is interesting. His previous film, The Dark Knight, was good but much overrated. His direction remains cold; it's solid but uninspired. Like DiCaprio's previous film, Shutter Island (2010), Inception has its moments. In the end, however, it's totally pointless. Some reviewers called Inception a masterpiece. In their case they don't know what a masterpiece is or they're deceiving themselves. This film is nowhere near a masterpiece. I guess it didn't help that I watched a masterwork like The Godfather Part II on the night before I went to see Inception in the theaters. In The Godfather everything feels like it belongs, and the film has real meaning. In the theater I could tell that most of the audience didn't like the film. One woman kept looking around to see how others were reacting to it. I don't recommend Inception. It's just another pointless summer blockbuster; it tries to be smart but fails. Much of it was influenced by great Japanese anime like Paprika (2006) and Akira (1988). See the anime instead.",8,10,31,16 July 2010
Prometheus," Though somewhat of a disappointment Prometheus is still grand and ambitious science-fiction.
","Prometheus is something to behold. It's an ambitious science-fiction film. It's been a long time since we've seen a good Alien film. What Prometheus does, however, is something different since it's a sort of prequel to Alien (1979). One may not even call it a prequel because it's barely related to the other films in the franchise. Ridley Scott (the old Englishman who gave us classics like Blade Runner and Thelma & Louise) returned to direct and it's obvious that he made an effort. The special effects look fantastic. The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is beautiful. Even the actors do a good job, Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender being the standouts. The action scenes, when they are there, are exciting. But, it's just too bad that the script by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof is so poor. It's filled with unimaginative dialogue, and it raises questions to which it gives no answers. In addition, the characters aren't well developed. So, there is very little substance for an ambitious premise. Still, Scott delivers some of his best work in years. There are few things here on the level of his old films but some scenes are genuinely breathtaking. Considering this it really hurts that the script is poor because just about everything else about Prometheus is good. If the script was good as well we may have had a good, if not great, science-fiction epic. As it is Prometheus is somewhat of a disappointment. It's structured a lot like the previous Alien films though it doesn't improve on them. Another thing worth mentioning is that the designs, of the aliens and the technology, are very impressive. I should mention that for me it became obvious that the script is poor when Shaw and Holloway were talking about ancient civilizations. Clearly the screenwriters don't know about Carroll Quigley's theory of civilizations, the best work on the subject out there. Despite this, Prometheus is definitely a film worth seeing. I doubt that it will scare you but it will certainly amaze you.",6,2,3,24 September 2012
X-Men: First Class," X-Men: First Class is a must-see superhero film.
","X-Men: First Class is a good summer blockbuster. Director Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass) crafted an engaging and entertaining film that, in the X-Men film series, is bettered only by X2 (2003). It acts as a prequel/reboot covering the origins of the X-Men in an alternate history where the powerful mutant Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) attempts to ignite a nuclear war between the USA and the USSR. Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) are signed up by US intelligence to foil Shaw's plans, and in the process they become good friends. The CGI is not perfect, but it's put to very good use. The story is solid (helped by the good script) with doses of effective humor throughout. Strongest in the film is the characterization. There are several notable performances. Bacon, McAvoy and especially Fassbender are in excellent form. The supporting cast is fine too (Nicholas Hoult, Zoe Kravitz, Jennifer Lawrence being the standouts). Better superhero films have been made, but First Class is definitely a WOW movie. It's a good example of what summer movies should be like. I recommend seeing it.",8,7,12,12 July 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Director Christopher Nolan lets loose and makes an entertaining film.
","Some reviewers have said that The Dark Knight Rises is the most anticipated Batman film yet. I don't agree with this. In my opinion The Dark Knight (2008) was more anticipated, especially because of the premature death of Heath Ledger. But another reason is because The Dark Knight Rises wasn't showered with as much critical praise. Unfortunately critics play a big role in people's decision making about films these days. So, what kind of a film is The Dark Knight Rises? For me this is director Christopher Nolan's most entertaining film yet. I can understand why The Dark Knight received a lot of praise but I have to say that I don't enjoy watching it much. In this film Nolan demonstrates more control of the cinematic medium, with a cast of appealing actors and a smooth flow to scenes. Christian Bale improves on his performance. Bale is a good actor but he hasn't been able to give Bruce Wayne much appeal until this film. Bane, played by Tom Hardy, is another reason to see the film. Hardy was able to make Bane into a frightening and memorable villain. The action is the film's biggest draw of course. The action is fantastic, with scenes which impress as well as make one wonder. The drama hangs heavily over the plot. Elements from the two previous Batman films have been brought back to conclude the trilogy on a grand and emotional scale. Catwoman also plays an important role. While Anne Hathaway does a good job she's not as memorable as Michelle Pfeiffer was in the role. It's Selina Kyle who provides most of the humor, though there's very little of it. I'm glad that Marion Cotillard plays a part. It certainly makes the film more interesting. So in conclusion Nolan delivered an uneven but spectacular superhero film with The Dark Knight Rises. I definitely recommend seeing it.",7,2,6,6 August 2012
Pitch Perfect," A formulaic but entertaining comedy with toe-tapping musical numbers.
","Pitch Perfect is a winning musical comedy. The lovely Anna Kendrick plays Beca, a girl studying at Barden College who wants to become a music producer. After some pressure from her professor father she joins the all-girl a capella group The Bellas. When going to see this film I didn't know what to expect. But to my surprise the music scenes here turned out to be very entertaining. A good deal of humor is milked from a capella singing. The soundtrack consists of catchy old & new hits including tracks by Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, Kelly Clarkson, Salt-N-Pepa, Madonna and Toni Basil. The characterization too is strong, and Beca is only one of several characters with a distinct personality. Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy is full of humor. Brittany Snow plays Chloe, a good girl who persuades Beca to try a capella singing in a funny scene in a shower room. Director Jason Moore and the producers (including Elizabeth Banks) tried to make the film hip & cool and they sure did succeed. The director and the cast promoted the film, and I recommend that you see their interviews on the internet. In conclusion, Pitch Perfect is one of the funniest films of the year. It's fresh and I definitely recommend seeing it.",7,2,5,24 October 2012
Godzilla," Gareth Edwards fails to do justice to the monster's legacy.
","If you've seen the trailer for this Godzilla film you probably thought that it would be a more faithful yet serious take on Japan's most famous monster. In the trailer Godzilla looked like a real threat. It seemed frightening the way it was portrayed. In the film though this isn't the case. We're yet again in that summer movie territory where the trailer was more inspired than the film itself. Does The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) come to mind? I think that the big reason why many people were disappointed with this Godzilla film is its lack of originality. If you pause and look at what's happening you'll see that it's actually very similar to the 1998 Godzilla film directed by Roland Emmerich. Godzilla is portrayed as a monster with some intelligence. It becomes a sympathetic creature. The American military and navy get involved, something that we've seen many times in Hollywood films recently. And, to top it all off, there's more focus on the human characters than on Godzilla. In fact, much time passes before the Big G even makes an appearance. So, just as in the 1998 film, we're forced to watch a typical human drama before anything exciting happens. But at least the 1998 film was entertaining. And it was a film about Godzilla. This 2014 film is lacking both Godzilla and entertainment. It's a summer movie, so I expected to be entertained. Instead I was left wondering what happened when the film ended. It wasn't just me. Other people in the theater were criticizing it right after it ended. Director Gareth Edwards really didn't have enough experience to make a big budget summer movie. The monster fights lack excitement, the acting is wooden, and the clichéd script lacks intelligence. I don't think that Edwards is a bad filmmaker. I think that he's an inexperienced filmmaker. His 2010 low-budget feature Monsters is a technical triumph that showed some promise. Max Borenstein's lazy script and studio interference are the two things that really ruined this film in my opinion. In a monster movie one would at least expect some exciting action but this film fails even at that. In addition, it's obvious that Edwards took the Jaws (1975) approach of obscuring the creature for much of the film's running time. Jaws, however, features interesting human characters and terrific performances. It keeps on movin' when the big shark isn't around. The human characters and performances in Edwards' Godzilla are flat, resulting in a truly dull middle section. Only Bryan Cranston, playing Joe Brody, stands out. Cranston is definitely one of the best Hollywood actors working now. His performance alone made this film bearable at the beginning, but even then the story's shortcomings were already noticeable. I have to admit that I had doubts about this film. I usually read reviews on a certain website before I go to the cinema. This time I made the mistake of reading the early positive reviews on IMDb, so I didn't wait for the review on that favorite website of mine. As it turned out, that website was right yet again and this Godzilla film made for an unpleasant night at the cinema. Some Godzilla fans might like what Edwards did, but casual moviegoers should definitely not buy a ticket. Remember, as was the case with the 1998 film, there's no hiding that this is a Western production. It has none of the quirks and cultural aspects of the Japanese films.",6,2,4,13 July 2014
Looper," A thought-provoking and thrilling sci-fi action film with a dose of originality.
","Looper is an exciting science fiction film which doesn't burst with originality but manages to bring something new to the genre anyway. In addition, it's also a crime film so there's no denying that in parts it's very violent. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis, playing the same main character, do an admirable job. It's presented well how a person can change as time passes. Director Rian Johnson wrote a good script so the actors have enough time to develop their characters. Jeff Daniels, in particular, is a standout. His role is relatively minor but he impresses when he explains the high stakes of being a looper. As the film moves along, after an informative but rather dull beginning, the sci-fi elements of the story begin to develop. The action too becomes frequent and entertaining, leading to an impressive ending. The future world of Looper is a mix of the ordinary and the fantastic. Mostly it's ordinary because Johnson tried to present a lived-in and quite possible future. He did an admirable job though it's clear that a sci-fi action film was new territory for him because the film's different elements don't come together as well as they should. Despite this it's a thrilling adventure which will no doubt impress viewers. In conclusion, Looper is another solid effort by Johnson. In my opinion, it's not an instant classic but it's certainly a film worth seeing.",8,1,6,4 October 2012
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," George Lucas' mythological popcorn film is a two-hour roller-coaster ride that has passed into movie legend.
","George Lucas spent four years developing and working on the galactic fantasy Star Wars. This was after he directed the dystopian science-fiction film THX 1138 (1971) and the rites-of-passage American Graffiti (1973). Star Wars was inspired by the Flash Gordon cartoon strip. It cost $8 million to make in Britain with three little-known Americans in the leading roles, supported by British actors. The story is a simple adventure yarn, and Lucas draws on samurai films, Westerns and every kind of myth, ancient and modern. The dogfights are based on a close study of World War II films. Star Wars was an immediate success. It became one of the great phenomena of cinematic history. It spawned two sequels, three prequels and endless imitators, creating a demand for spectacular blockbusters that has not yet ended. Industrial Light and Magic, the special effects unit that served the film, became a multi-billion dollar organization. Lucas himself also became and has remained one of Hollywood's most powerful figures. The film certainly struck a nerve in an America recovering from the humiliations of the Vietnam war. Ronald Reagan, elected president three years after Star Wars was made, spoke of the Soviet Union as 'the Evil Empire' and gave his proposed space-defense system the title Star Wars. The original Star Wars trilogy contributed to the worldwide renewal of the filmgoing habit, but in creating an appetite for child-like blockbusters that depend on special effects rather than on character and subtle narrative, the film unfortunately played a key role in what was to be called 'the dumbing down' of America and popular culture.",10,7,10,5 October 2010
50_50," 50/50 is a touching and entertaining comedy-drama.
","In 50/50 Joseph Gordon-Levitt manages to make a seemingly ordinary character into someone quite special. Gordon-Levitt was always a reliable actor but in 50/50 he delivers a performance worthy of much praise and even worthy of that glossy corporate Oscar. The film is a comedy-drama about Adam Lerner, a young man who finds out that he has cancer. The witty script was written by Will Reiser and inspired by Reiser's own experience with cancer. The film also stars Seth Rogen, Anna Kendrick, Bryce Dallas Howard, Anjelica Huston, Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer. Rogen, pretty much playing himself, delivers another of the film's excellent performances as Adam's sex-obsessed but reliable best friend Kyle Hirons. Then there's the adorable Kendrick as Adam's inexperienced therapist Katherine McKay. Honestly, the more I see Kendrick the more I like her. She's certainly a good screen presence and she tackles her roles differently, making each one stand out. It's no wonder that Jason Reitman picked her for the role of Natalie Keener in Up In The Air (2009) after seeing her impressive performance in Rocket Science (2007). 50/50 is reminiscent of the great 1983 hit Terms Of Endearment. One can even say that it's in the same league as that film. The moment when Adam embraces his mother before being taken to the operating room is poignant. Gordon-Levitt doesn't overplay it. It's this approach which makes his performance special. He certainly tried to distinguish himself after his role in 3rd Rock From The Sun, acting in films by directors like Rian Johnson, Christopher Nolan and Gregg Araki. In conclusion, 50/50 is a good and entertaining film with a wonderful cast. It's certainly worth seeing.",7,1,2,1 November 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," The biggest and loudest CGI extravaganza in film history.
","Wow. Just wow. If you thought that director Michael Bay was going to take a gentler approach to the third film then be prepared for a surprise. Dark Of The Moon is huge both in action and in the amount of CGI. This time the decepticons have a very transformers-like plan to take over the world. Who stand in their way? Only a small number of autobots and humans. How good is the film? It's somewhere between the first and the second films. It has only two things going for it: the fantastic CGI and the impressive 3D presentation. For a film like this Bay has given up such things as character development, a coherent story or tight direction. Dark Of The Moon is a mess, but not as much as Revenge Of The Fallen. Characters come and go for little or no reason. The humor is awkward, lousy or disgusting. Some scenes are underdeveloped or unnecessary. The acting is bad or passable. The score is loud and generic. The American patriotism is, once again, over the top. A shocker is in store for viewers concerning the American space program. But the worst thing is that Michael Bay still hasn't learned (or decided to ignore) why the transformers cartoons were likable. The transformers themselves were real characters, and they looked different and interesting. In this film it takes some effort to see who's who when they're fighting. Dark Of The Moon is a money-making product at its simplest. It's meant to lure audiences with its predictable combination of humor, action and special effects. It's passable entertainment, but I wouldn't watch it a second time. Like the previous two transformers films Dark Of The Moon is a true product of the Bush era.",8,1,4,18 July 2011
Princess Mononoke," Princess Mononoke preserves the director's spirit of humanism while succeeding as a daring action-adventure.
","Director Hayao Miyazaki spent twenty years considering the story that would eventually become Princess Mononoke, transforming it from something more obviously linked to fairytale and folklore into a passionate plea for us to learn from history instead of simply repeating it. It's an uncomfortable film, full of ambiguity. Ashitaka is the perfect hero, brave, strong, unpretentious, and kind, yet he kills when he has to. San - vicious, unreasoning, and utterly focused - ought to be a villain, but Miyazaki refuses to allow that simplistic label, insisting through each of his characters and their relationships that instead of name-calling we should be cooperating, because the only alternative is destruction. Princess Mononoke is a primitive film in many ways, both violent and pessimistic. The woodlands in which it is set are full of strange spirits and gods, beautiful, but threatening. The score by Joe Hisaishi supports this sense of threat, with a closing theme that's an eerie counter tenor solo that sends chills down the spine. It's also the first Studio Ghibli film to make extensive use of computer animation, a decision taken by producer Toshio Suzuki to meet an otherwise impossible deadline at the end of the three-year production process. Unlike other Miyazaki films this one is not for small children - there's too much violence, bloodshed and death for that. It's a complex, legendary tale, but one that is easy to follow, thrillingly exciting, and never less than beautiful to look at - like a detailed painting brought to life. Though it was Miyazaki's subsequent effort, Spirited Away (2001), that won the Oscar, Princess Mononoke is probably more worthy of it.",10,1,3,19 October 2010
The Martian," The Martian focuses on the triumph of human ingenuity under duress.
","Is The Martian science fiction or science fact? Well, it's set in the near future, in 2035, so it's not easy to call it science fiction, although it's technically science fiction. It's not entirely science fact either because some of the science on display in The Martian is questionable. What matters, however, is that the film is entertaining and memorable. There's no question that Ridley Scott is one of the best directors working in Hollywood. Prometheus (2012) marked his return to the science fiction genre, and now we have The Martian, which is even better. Prometheus is a visually impressive film that, unfortunately, has a confusing plot, poor characterization, and pacing issues. It was an attempt to repeat the formula of Alien (1979) and maybe even Aliens (1986), with mixed results. The Martian, on the other hand, isn't dark and confusing. It's straight-forward and upbeat. It centers around an astronaut (Matt Damon) who gets stranded on Mars and has to survive. His struggle to get in contact with NASA and to return home is what keeps the film running. I was surprised by how entertaining the film is. Firstly, the characters in The Martian make rational decisions. They're not a bunch of degenerates and fools who run around and get into trouble, like in Prometheus. And the performances from the cast are all solid. Leading man Matt Damon did good work playing Mark Watney, someone who's often funny and hardly ever depressed. Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie, and Chiwetel Ejiofor are in supporting roles. Secondly, the science that's on display in the film is interesting. Some of what is shown makes viewers think, and wonder what's going to happen. Viewers can actually learn a few things from the film. This is due to the fact that the film is based on Andy Weir's 2011 novel, which was adapted into a screenplay by Drew Goddard. And, of course, The Martian is visually impressive, something that's to be expected from a Ridley Scott film. Some of the scenes set on Mars are stunning. The designs of the suits and vehicles are excellent too. So, The Martian is definitely worth recommending. It's a great example of crowd-pleasing cinema.",7,3,5,18 January 2016
