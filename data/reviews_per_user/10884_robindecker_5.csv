The Perks of Being a Wallflower," nice and simple....though not infinite.
","This movie works and shows that plots do not always have to be complicated. Had the movie been cut 10 sec. earlier, I would have raised it to 8/10. The end touch about 'feeling infinite' was, I felt, not in tune with the movie, which was much more about having courage to create yourself, and the quality of those rare moments, those rare fruits you ripe out of the tree of your own soul . The growth of Charlie's Character from shyness to confidence was well established. Other parts of his mental instability and past history were more confusing to me. This movie remains a nice message of hope for coming of age generations that are going through moments of hardship or suffering.",7,0,1,9 February 2014
Full Metal Jacket," The G.I. has no Jacket.
","A schizophrenic movie...in the epistemological sense. The first part not being connected to the second, leaves you a sorrow taste of disappointment once you finish watching the last scene. Then Kubric's FMJ last quarter trods along paths of suspense- action dilettantism, having lost all it's central line and theoretical grounding. From movies like ' paths of glory' (1957) we know Kubric is able follow a central theme with brilliance and art. What happened here?Then of course there is the message 'first to act, last to think'. Where are we going from there, what is the alternative...?I am left speechless, puzzled and disappointed 5/10",5,1,3,12 February 2014
Rush," the human condition
","I was not very enthusiastic about a racing movie, but it emanated, once I finished it, the flare of an epic tale and the scope of the human condition. Life is about speed; this allegory even has a name, namely 'red queen dynamics' (if you want to go forward in the biological realm, you need not to advance, but to advance quicker that you opponent). We may look upon this fact with moral judgments and ethical concerns, but it is just a fact really. Now, this does not take away, but really engages, and especially for us humans, things like solidarity, friendship, family and respect for your opponents strength and dignity. And also, on every round, the tough decision about getting into the fight, to take the race to pole position, or stepping out, putting at security not only our life, but also the one of those we love.",9,2,3,11 February 2014
Amadeus," less is more!
","I am both marveled and angry at this movie. Angry, mainly because it almost was the best one I have ever seen! What kept it from getting there? Let's say those few Don Jovanni scenes that were neither important nor constructive to the plot as the whole. This makes for maybe 15-20 min. more in this movie...enough to prevent it being the greatest 'chez- d'oeuvre' in film history. It is funny that this is not about something lacking...it is about something more! What could have propelled this movie to first place was some courage in the cutting stage. Ask Frank Darabont; one of the reasons why Shawshank is still nÂ°1!",9,0,1,8 February 2014
The Silence of the Lambs," Anaximander meets Jung
","The oldest saying of Western Civilisation, states that 'things render justice (dike) to each other, and pay penalty to each other (tisis) for their injustice (adikia) according to the ordinance of time' (Anaximander 610- 546 B.C.).C.G.Jung (1875-1961): Persona
Here 'Frederick Chilton as archetype of 'subjective cover-up' untruthfulness, in-authenticity.Hanibal: Figure of 'Dike': Truth maker
Truth here conceived as the ability to reveal one's hidden agenda, to come forth in truthfulness, the ability to carry one's lamb, one's innocence (christian figure).Hannibal eating the tongues: The hypothesized inability of the person, after a certain state, after having hidden fully behind it's persona, to speak truthfully and in resonance with a christian, lamb-like, shadow integrated voice.Our innocence is the heaviest burden to carry.",9,0,0,5 February 2020
