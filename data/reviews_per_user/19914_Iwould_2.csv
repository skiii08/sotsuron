The Avengers," only the distant echo of a powerful shout
","I just saw the movie. I have been a comic reader and a movie goer for more than twenty years now, and a film like this should have been my wet dream. Instead what I saw was a hollow, empty attempt to recreate the magic of the original comic book: an attempt that poorly fails in a miserable way despite (or I should say: thanks to) all the special effects and the star power the producers have tried to throw in. The fantasy, the wit, the ideas that were present in the comic and that made it the dreams and the joy of so many kids, were completely absent in this studio behemoth. I will admit that the recreation of such magic was a difficult task, probably doomed from the beginning: but this thing is completely lacking brain, or direction, or any meaning at all. The script is a total and utter disaster, full of bore and incredibly shallow, and it goes just ridiculous every time it tries to go funny with sketches and jokes all very similar between themselves. I will rate the movie 2 stars just to give it credit for having been able to give us the first decent Banner/Hulk: it took only three attempts to the Hollywood writers - and god knows how many millions of dollars wasted. Movies like 'Avengers' are unlucky children that inherit only all the defects from both the parents, which in this case would be Mr. Mainstream Comics and Mrs. Movie Industry. This leaves them with basically no audience: they are too much gruesome and boring for kids, too much childish for youngsters, while for the adults - at least for those the grown-up ones - there are just too many capes. The same stories, printed on comic pages, still resonate in popular culture after decades: but this movie will be hopefully forgotten as soon as the media battage slow down.",2,44,154,24 April 2012
Youth," a costume drama about old age
","'Youth' is a movie about age: lots of words are spent about being old, and you must eventually assume that the title of the movie is defined by exclusion. Most of interactions are between couples (friend with friend, father with daughter) whose talks very rarely sound like actual talks, and very often look like monologues. Not strange at all, anyway, as a third important subject (a.k.a. the audience) is always present â€“ so the talking is basically for us. People that complain with Sorrentino for these kind of things just don't understand what the man is trying to do: yeah, his characters looks like they have written words in front of them and are taking turns to deliver their own, but, guess what, this is a perfect definition for the term 'acting in a movie'. Peace.Michael Caine shines in the leading role, in his usual soft-spoken and controlled fashion. He is surrounded but two magnificent counterparts, the old (but young inside) Harvey Keitel and the young (but old inside) world famous actor portrayed by Paul Dano. These characters allow us to see how, never mind the age, you are just as much young as you want to be (the word 'Youth' is possibly used in this movie as an alternate definition of 'Life': you can be a youngster of 10, 30 of 70 years old, as long as you keep on learning from your mistakes). Harvey Keitel gets a very rare chance to star in the role of an intellectual, a director who's writing his 'testament'. He has a real great cinema-moment (the women of his movie life, reunited in a dreamy swiss panorama, halfway between Fellini 8 1/2 and Nuovo Cinema Paradiso ending montage), and provides energy and credibility to a character who's not entirely able to come to terms with his life (which is what Michael Caine eventually accomplish): as life is what it is, of course, but life is all there is - of course.I would have skipped the final sequence with the concert: you can't keep on talking about a great piece of art for the whole movie, and then make the big mistake of trying to show it, as such great expectations are easy to be failed. But anyway I liked the strange unreal feeling of this movie, his peculiar setting and choice of characters, their detached reflections about life: it looks like a fantasy movie, or a ghosts story. I believe that it can be enjoyed by anybody, despite the age, regardless of the stage of 'Youth' you currently are or feel in.",8,14,27,2 June 2015
