The Avengers," Nice to watch BUT ONLY FOR Americans!
","since when THOR the Great, the hammer-wielding GOD who is associated with thunder, lightning, storms and massive strength THE protector of mankind,takes orders from one little snot (capten America)and follows that orders?Since when Capten America is above all?Since when we must see all that crap for raising up the American backbone?ENOUGH!God of thunder, the Vicking's God , from the German mythology CANOT kneel down to capten America.Also since when capten America is above Hulk and Iron man Loki and Thor? Ohhhh now i see it!!!BECAUSE HE HAS THE American FLAG AT HIS CHEST!!!And Loki HOW CAN HE loose from Capten America? Loki is A GOD!So it is good for spending time and LAUGHING with the director making a movie for CAPTEN America (THE GREATEST ALL BECAUSE HE IS WEARING AN American FLAG) and generally for raising up the American morality !Grow UP and make a story AS IT SHOULD BE!WE ARE NOT Americans ALL OVER THE EARTH!Also the movie has parts for laughing WHEN STARTS THE monologues the American boy as 'LEADER'!IF you are American you would be very proud of the movie!IF NOT............ i leave it up to you!!!",1,8,42,11 September 2012
