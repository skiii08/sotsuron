Minority Report," A great time @ the movies
","There is probably no busier filmmaker this year than Steven Spielberg.  With 'Minority Report', the upcoming 'Catch Me If You Can', and all of his responsibilities at Dreamworks, I'd be surprised if he gets any sleep.  He is also one of the filmmakers I have worried about most.  He has created some of Hollywood's most beloved films, but recently he has started to go on a downward slope.  His trademark Spielberg Shmaltz has been around forever, but these days it has started to take over his films.  In his shaky failure 'A.I'., many mistook his sappiness for emotional complexity; maybe they were just hungry for something resembling a real science fiction film.  His latest film, 'Minority Report', has just brought this disappointing streak to a screeching halt.  It catapults Steven Spielberg back to the forefront of the multi-million dollar blockbuster directors.Based on Phillip K. Dick's famous short story, 'Minority Report' tells the story of Detective John Anderton (Tom Cruise).  He is part of a special police force ('Precrime') that is able to stop murders before they happen. They do this by looking into the psychic visions of three genetically deformed beings nicknamed 'Precogs', the strongest of which being the only female, Agatha (Samantha Morton).  While an FBI agent (Danny Witwer, played by Colin Farrell) is investigating Pre-Crime, which director Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow) has great plans for, Anderton notices something stunning. The Precogs have just determined that he would commit murder.'Minority Report' is Spielberg's most assuredly entertaining film since his 'Indiana Jones' series.  Obviously, something Spielberg has not forgotten is to make the most of the chase.  When other filmmakers seem to have seen too many Road Runner cartoons, Spielberg always comes up with a way to mix it up a bit.  In this film, he has devised one of the most exhilarating chase sequences since... well, ever.  The stakes are never quite high enough for Spielberg without adding one little twist; I'm sure the only reason there was a boulder in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' was so that Harrison Ford could run away from it, and it's very likely that the only reason cars climb buildings in 'Minority Report''s future is so Tom Cruise can leap between them.  The whole thing blends together so seamlessly, and the camera (lead by cinematographer Janusz Kaminski) puts us so exuberantly into the middle of it all that we don't care what Spielberg throws in there just for fun. 
That isn't all 'Minority Report' has to offer (if it was, would it really deserve such high praise?)  'Minority Report' does more than offer its ideas, it dives head on into them.  The way John Anderton gets to where he does, by way of a prevision from the Precogs, sets up a predicament not unlike that in Shakespeare's 'Macbeth'.  It creates a Mobius strip worth poring over.  Numerous questions come to mind, such as how much was needed to get that chain of events to spark; how much does it take to drive someone to an extreme?Possibly the most intriguing of all the questions 'Minority Report' brings up is that which philosophers have been debating about and tearing their hair out over for decades: does anyone have free will, or are all events predestined to happen?  This film offers fuel for both sides of the argument, but always counterbalances one piece of evidence with the next. It is this ambiguity that made 'Memento' so much fun, after seeing this film you will have much to debate about with those you have seen it with.If one could label 'Minority Report' as something of a tragedy, that element would be found in the female Precog, Agatha.  Yes, there is a brief conversation over what ethics there are in idealizing three people so much, but that is not the issue that matters.  Its chilling to see that no one who works within the Precrime system realizes the absolute unethical, whoring nature of keeping the Precogs confined as they are.  Once the film starts to view the situation through Agatha's eyes, the film changes in its entirety. Samantha Morton plays Agatha so brilliantly that we can completely understand her position.  We see what happens when everything is taken away from someone who is then forced to take it back.  We see what is really wrong with the Precrime system and the cruelty that lay within it.Not to be put aside is the look of the film.  Spielberg's main mistake with 'A.I.' was making that future much too pretty.  Instead of being able to see where we were headed, the film felt distant, as if we were watching a fantasy instead of a science fiction.  With 'Minority Report', Spielberg gathered a group of 'futurists' to brainstorm just what Washington, D.C. might look like sometime in the not-so-distant future, and the result is incredibly believable.  I shall most likely live until 2054, and when that time comes, I would like to revisit this film and see just how accurate it was.If you really need me to categorize, I would say that 'Minority Report' is Steven Spielberg's best film since 'Schindler's List'.  I would also say that this film is the best blockbuster of the summer, and may well end up being one of the very best films of the entire year.  Right now, however, I will just say this: see the damn film, it'll be worth even the ridiculous amount one has to pay for movie tickets these days.",Null,0,0,16 September 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Force is with this one...
","By now, you have most likely read many scathing reviews of the latest installment in the 'Star Wars' prequel trilogy, 'Attack of the Clones'. Do not let them convince you that George Lucas has lost touch with the Force. His latest movie, number two in the prequel trilogy chronicling the transition of Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader, does what the 'Star Wars' movies are supposed to do.  It sweeps you off of your feet and provides a spectacle of escapist entertainment that should not be missed.  Unlike the easily enjoyable but tough to absorb piece of eye candy 'The Phantom Menace', 'Attack of the Clones' actually feels like a 'Star Wars' movie.
The Republic is in grave danger of being torn down by thousands of separatist star systems who are threatening to abandon it.  The Galactic Senate, lead by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDarmid), must vote on whether to create an army for the Republic to counter this threat. Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), former queen of Naboo, arrives at the planet of Coruscant only to be the target of a failed assassination attempt. Two Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) are sent to protect her.
If you think the above sounds boring, you're right.  For the first fifteen minutes or so, 'Attack of the Clones' is bogged down in political mumbojumbo that really has no place in a 'Star Wars' movie.  I was slightly interested, but spent most of that time wondering when the fun would start.  I was not squirming in my seat for long; fifteen minutes into the film 'Attack of the Clones' gets back into the old 'Star Wars' tradition with an incredibly exciting chase through the city of Coruscant.  From there, the film had me in its grip.
Mostly.  The overlapping of three storylines was well handled, but the execution of one of them; the supposed romance between Padme and Anakin, is not.  The screenplay, a collaboration between George Lucas and Jonathan Hales, feels recycled and tired.  Simply put, it is quite obvious that it was written by two middle aged men.  That is not to say the dialogue doesn't have its moments, but it needs to spread its wings and get comfortable with itself.  It is in the romance where it falters the most, making what could have been a grand affair into a silly flirt that jumps to quick conclusions. It serves its purpose in the big picture, but does not press any of the emotional buttons that it would like to think it does.  It represents George Lucas' stubborness that the 'Star Wars' series belongs soley to him.  I can think of other screenwriters who could have done a magnificent job with a screenplay for 'Attack of the Clones', but George Lucas simply will not have it.
One other place where 'Attack of the Clones' falters is in its dialogue for the Jedi Master Yoda.  There are times when what came out of Yoda's mouth was not at all like the backwards Yoda-isms we have come to know and love. Nonetheless, Yoda is the star of 'Attack of the Clones'.  Yoda is the kind of character who will live on as long as movies do; he deserves the title of legend just as much (and in some cases more) than many filmmakers or actors who have been given that title.  In 'Attack of the Clones', Yoda does have a surprise up his sleeve which some may deem to be out of character.  It is not.  Yoda is a legend, and seeing him as he is in 'Clones' is like revealing long-lost scrolls with tales of past triumphs for the first time. Yoda carries a commanding presence onscreen that is impossible to ignore.
Aside from the romance, 'Attack of the Clones' is a wonderfully exciting movie that cannot be seen as anything else but an event.  It is a mystery of sorts that harkens to 'The Empire Strikes Back'; intelligent and involving. It leaves the viewer wanting more; setting up a feverish anticipation for Episode III, which is to be the last film in the series.  Don't think that means you don't get bang for your buck.  'Attack of the Clones' builds up to a rousing climax; a final 45 minutes of pure, pulse-pounding, gee-whiz action bliss that outdoes anything in 'The Phantom Menace'.  Also, 'Attack of the Clones' gives you something more than a subtle wink at how things are going to turn out for our characters in the future, unlike the previous installment.
The acting in 'Attack of the Clones' does not stumble through the film as the screenplay does.  The performances are all as good as any have been in a 'Star Wars' movie.  Ewan McGregor is slowly turning into Alec Guiness' Obi-Wan, but he is his own and not merely an imitator.  Natalie Portman shows a nice amount of peril here and there, but it was her performance that I grew tired of most quickly.  Christopher Lee, who is a master at playing characters like his treacherous Count Dooku (see him as Saruman in 'Lord of the Rings'), is the perfect villain to counter Ian McDarmid's mysterious, brooding Senator.  I particularly liked Temuera Morrison as Jango Fett, who was able to give the character a good amount of menace while still being fatherly and even warm towards his son, Boba (Daniel Logan II).  Out of the entire ensemble, all eyes are on Hayden Christensen.  Rest assured, he fills Anakin Skywalker's shoes admirably.  His Anakin is just juvenile enough, just reckless enough, and just sympathetic enough.  There are times when we can feel for Anakin, and with this screenplay, that is no small feat.  I'm looking forward to more of Christensen's performances both inside the 'Star Wars' universe and out.
'Attack of the Clones', not surprisingly, is a feast for the eye and ear. Industrial Light and Magic (ILM for short) has outdone themselves this time. This may just be the most visually enticing 'Star Wars' film yet.  From its beautiful, brilliantly designed atmospheres to its varied and complex creatures, 'Attack of the Clones' never ceases to amaze.  George Lucas realizes that CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) is a paintbrush and not a firecracker; a way to create ingenious worlds and not just blow things up. 'Attack of the Clones' may just be one of the best uses of CGI since the technique was introduced.  John Williams compliments what's up on screen with his most memorable score since 'Schindler's List'.  It's subtle, inventive, and has a classic sense to it that even helps save some scenes that would otherwise be left in the cheese-ball gutter.  The love theme is especially grand, it's just too bad the romance itself isn't up to snuff.
George Lucas is not a masterful filmmaker.  He cannot handle the complexities of the human heart, nor are his recent films groundbreaking. He does, however, remember how much fun movies are supposed to be.  No matter how cheesy, no matter how silly, the reason we go to the movies is to escape.  'Star Wars' has always been the perfect potpourri of pure escapist fun.  That's all they have ever been meant to do, and 'Attack of the Clones' most definitely delivers the goods.",8,0,0,25 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Whodathunkit? They did the impossible...
","RATING:  ***1/2 out of ****
I don't need to tell you how much of a classic J.R.R Tolkein's 'The Lord of the Rings' series is. I don't need to tell you that its influence has been felt all over, from 'Star Wars' to Led Zeppelin. I also don't need to tell you what a huge undertaking it is for anyone to adapt it to the big screen, something which many considered impossible. But lo and behold, here it is, a well-acted, respectfully scripted and incredibly epic film that only years ago would have been considered a fanboy's pipe dream.Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) is an unassuming, happy little hobbit (little people for those who aren't Tolkein-initiated). His uncle, Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) is preparing to leave his home in the Shire (someplace in the Middle-Earth) for some peace and quiet. Years before the start of the film, he found a ring that allows people to disappear in the hideout of a creature named Gollum. He doesn't know that it's really a 'Ring of Power' that would give Supreme Evil Guy Sauron the strength he needs to take over the world. Silly Bilbo. Well, anyway, after a huge birthday party in his honor, Bilbo leaves the Shire and the ring behind him. His residence and many of his possessions (including the ring) go to Frodo. Wizard friend Gandalf (Ian McKellen) comes to tell him all about the ring, who's searching for it and what Frodo has to do: bring it across Middle-Earth to Rivendell, where it will be temporarily safe. Frodo leaves with three of his hobbit friends, Pippin (Billy Boyd), Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Sam (Sean Astin) to do his duty. The ring proves to be a real pain in the ass, with nine seemingly immortal Ringwraiths (I'm not gonna explain these things anymore, so just go read the books, OK?) on their tail. Some protection comes from Aragon (or 'Strider') who helps them out of more than just plain ol' good will. Some may consider this a spoiler, but the four hobbits + Strider get the ring to Rivendell, where we learn that the ring has to be destroyed at the center of Mount Doom. Always the brave one, Frodo agrees to take it there, and a fellowship of elves, dwarves, hobbits and men will protect him. From there our adventure continues.It's not too much of a stretch to call 'The Fellowship of the Ring' the most ambitious Hollywood offering of the year (don't even talk to me about 'Moulin Rouge', which played it very safe thank you very much). New Line took huge risks enlisting a relatively unknown director (Peter Jackson) and trusting him with about $350 million and one of the most revered fantasy epics of all time. All three films were shot at the same time, so if this one failed, there'd be trouble for New Line. But thankfully, 'Fellowship' is a success, containing its fair share of magnificent moments. The last time I enjoyed a purely fantasy film this much was the original 'Star Wars'.The beginning of the film is where I found the most faults, and it's a rare case of the omission of details from the source actually being distracting. That is a little nit-pick, and very soon, the film had me under its spell. 'The Fellowship of the Ring', unlike another wildly popular fantasy film (*cough* 'Harry Potter' *cough*), is not a slavish mirage of visual interpretations. Rather, this film is it's own. Jackson has done a terrific job in making everything seem real and natural. I got the feeling that each set has a magnificent history behind it, like the film was merely there documenting one quest in the long life of the Middle Earth. There is some magic afoot here; I really believed that the Middle Earth existed.The cast of 'Fellowship', for the most part, does a magnificent job. I enjoyed the hobbits, and Elijah Wood, who isn't exactly the first person one would think to play Frodo, but does a very good job. I wasn't as impressed with Ian Holm, whose performance was unfortunately the low point of the film. He was all fine and good while playing the hobbit in his quieter moments, but when it's time to get serious, he plays Bilbo so fiercely that it was simply unpleasant to watch him. But fortunately, he is given little screen time and is given less dramatic moments, so that is a small quibble. The women of 'Fellowship', although we see them just as much as Bilbo, do good. I enjoyed the little twist on the original flight to Rivendell that helped us get to know Lady Arwen (Liv Tyler) a little more, and Cate Blanchett is (literally) luminous as Galadriel. A few of the characters in the fellowship go undeveloped, but most people do not want to sit through a four hour director's cut, so unfortunately Jackson did have to cut a few corners. But out of the entire cast, it is Ian McKellen who is most memorable. He is more than completely and totally believable; I was convinced that he was the only one who could ever play Gandalf.'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' is a solid, sometimes mesmerizing work. This seems like a movie that will be remembered for a while, and I hope that the next two films can follow suit. We are going to be a spoiled bunch of moviegoers these next two years, if we get this kind of present every holiday season. Finally, here we have a finely made film to add to the list of enduring cinematic fantasies. The tagline says 'Power can be held in the smallest of things.' It's a good thing Hollywood realized this, and trusted the small New Zealand team that brought this epic to life. At least someone these days knows how to get bang for their buck.",8,0,0,23 February 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Nausiatingly Overrated
","I know I'm going to get hate mail for this review. 'Moulin Rouge' is just one of those movies. Everybody just adores it, and you're stuck there thinking 'what?' Sure, I could see where everybody's coming from. Love story, good production values, pop songs, and all that jazz. But 'Moulin Rouge' is a movie that is as easy to despise as it is to love.
The premise is simple. Take a whole bunch of pop music, plop it in the middle of a turn-of-the-century atmosphere and stick in a love story. Some would say such simple words wouldn't be enough to describe this film, but really, that's all it is. 'Moulin Rouge' seems more like a reason for a soundtrack than a film.Ewan McGregor is Christian, an aspiring poet traveling to France for inspiration. Little does he know, inspiration will without a doubt come his way soon, in the form of Satine (Nicole Kidman), a popular courtesan working in the Moulin Rouge. He instantly falls in love, but of course, he can't live happily ever after with her ('The only way of lovin' me, baby, is to pay a lovely fee!') And Satine has other plans for her future than spending it with Christian, and as her dreams to become an actress start to turn into reality, the greedy Duke of Monroth tries to bind her exclusively to him. So, take this, throw in 'Smells Like Teen Spirit', 'Like A Virgin' and more, and what do you get? A ludicrous fiasco that's not even fun enough to be a sequel to 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' (yes, that IS a movie...)
For a while in the beginning, the film is a joy to watch. But this lasts only a few minutes, for as the story starts to develop, the film stops having fun with itself and begins to set up a serious, dramatic mood. That would work if this was any other movie. But in 'Moulin Rouge', the utter ridiculousness of the placement of pop songs undermines anything notable. In the first scenes, I smiled when Christian randomly blurts out 'The Sound of Music' and 'All You Need is Love'. Very quickly, however, I was getting tired of all the oo-la-la. By the time Zidler (Jim Broadbent) is singing 'Like A Virgin', I was laughing at them, not with them. And don't even mention the ill-timed musical number set to 'Roxanne'.
I have to admit though, Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman certainly do have the pipes to carry out the job. They sing with passion (the same can't be said about a certain Mariah Carey) and truly bring out some spirit in the middle of all the chaos. It's too bad the film is such a pain, because they give performances worthy of recognition. The rest of the cast seems like they're having a good time, which does make the film slide along a little easier.'Moulin Rouge' starts with an idea that something could be done with. However, director Baz Luhrmann sells-out completely, completely giving his movie up for commercial success. There is really little inspiration after the first shots, and the premise might be able to sustain for two hours if the way it was carried out wasn't so gag-inducing. Quick note to Mr. Luhrmann: it's a very bad sign when you're is laughing so hard during dramatic moments that at the end, your friend turns to you and suggests you leave 'before the people in the back start shooting'.",4,0,1,7 January 2002
Black Hawk Down," A Surprisingly Visceral Experience
","RATING:  **** / ****
I was skeptical going into 'Black Hawk Down'. After all, just look at the credits. Ridley Scott is the director, and he hasn't had a good film for ages (no, not even 'Gladiator'.) Jerry Bruckheimer has bad enough judgment to produce cash cows like 'Pearl Harbor' (and that's a train wreck big enough to destroy anyone's career.) The cast, while featuring some good actors, is not exactly stellar. I was convinced I wouldn't see the film after seeing the trailer (the dialogue struck me as incredibly poor). But somehow I found myself seeing it, and boy was I surprised when I discovered the most riveting, unsettling war film since 'Saving Private Ryan'.
The time is October 3, 1993; the place is Somalia. 120 American soldiers were on a mission to capture lieutenants of warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid. 'Black Hawk Down' is a portrait of how what was supposed to be a half-hour mission turned into a grueling, 18 hour ordeal that led hundreds of Somalis and 18 Americans to their deaths. 'Black Hawk Down' is amazing in how it puts you right in a soldiers shoes. It doesn't speechify or go heavy on irony. The event is depicted through actions, not words, and the result is stunning. We see each little decision that was made, each step that went wrong, and how it all lead to tragedy. Watching 'Black Hawk Down', I felt like I was actually a soldier in combat, and it was terrifying.
It is important to remember that this film isn't about the politics and the reasoning behind the mission, but about the experience. There is no trying to justify the reasons why things happened like they did. At times, it seems the screenplay (written by Ken Nolan and Steven Zaillian) wants to go that route, but Ridley Scott won't let it. We don't get to know the characters, but the idea of the film is that you are one of them. 'Black Hawk Down' differs from films like 'Saving Private Ryan' in that it isn't so much about the soldiers lives and their legacies, but more the terror of being shoved into circumstances beyond your control. Scott has regained his title of one of the most visually brilliant directors around, after losing it with films like 'Gladiator' and 'Hannibal'. Anyone can make a film gory, few people are clear-headed enough to make it realistic. 'Enemy at the Gates', for example, gives us a good look at Russian soldiers being mowed down by German machine guns, but the film is such a blur that it's impossible to care for them. In 'Black Hawk Down', a sense of urgency is constantly pushing the film forward. Every time Scott cuts to a wide-angle shot to show the incoming enemy, it will get the entire audience tense. But as soon as he brings you back down into the action, the tenseness turns into horror. At times it feels almost impossible to watch, but it is just as hard to turn away. There is the issue of the treatment of the Somalis in 'Black Hawk Down'. It's a sticky subject. I won't pretend that most of the Somalis aren't being treated as the enemy. But I will say that the film is not overly unfair. This is a film about battle, told from one side's point of view. If this were a story about the Somalis, then the Americans would be just as much the 'bad guys'. But this is battle, plain and simple, and no matter which way one looks at it, its barbaric. What would be unfair is if the film assumed it knew the other side's every thought and tried to simplify their story. This was done to the Japanese in 'Pearl Harbor' with disastrous results.
'Black Hawk Down' is a visceral film that shook me down to the core. It doesn't try to tell the political and moral complications behind all the chaos, which are far too vast and incomprehensible for any film to grasp. Film is a visual medium, and so Ridley Scott keeps the speechifying to a minimum and with his camera puts us in the middle of one of the biggest travesties since the Vietnam War.",9,0,0,23 February 2002
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," The musical that can beat the stuffing out of 'Moulin Rouge'
","RATING:  **** out of ****Think about what rock musicals have been like. It's no surprise that when most people think about the rock musical, they think about midnight showings with tons of obsessed fans screaming as the movie plays out before them, decked in attire identical to that of the characters up on screen. One thinks of cultish style, no substance. In other words, when thinking about the rock musical, one immediately thinks 'Rocky Horror', and there's a reason for that. Finally, someone has decided to take the rock musical seriously and it works better than one could've imagined. Ladies and gentlemen, whether you like it or not... 'HEDWIG!' Based on the off-Broadway hit of the same name, Hedwig and the Angry Inch is about Hedwig Robinson (John Cameron Mitchell), and his journey to find his 'other half'. While living in East Berlin, Hedwig (then Hansel) meets Sgt. Luther Robinson (Maurice Dean Wint), who over some gummi bears decides to marry him. The only problem is, he has to marry him in Berlin, which would require a physical examination. 'To get away, you've gotta leave something behind,' Luther tells Hansel. So it is agreed that Hansel must have a sex change operation. Unfortunately for Hansel (who changes his name to Hedwig), the doctor botched the operation, leaving him with nothing but an 'angry inch'. Luther and Hedwig run off to America, where Luther's wandering eye gets the best of him. Left alone, Hedwig just puts on some makeup, pulls the wig down from the shelf and goes back to her first love of music. That too has its problems: Hedwig gets involved in a relationship with Tommy Speck (Michael Pitt), who steals her music and becomes pop icon Tommy Gnosis. When we meet Hedwig at the beginning of the film, her and her band The Angry Inch are following Gnosis world tour in hopes of landing a successful lawsuit.
'Hedwig' rocks like no other movie I have ever seen. The soundtrack is (in my humble opinion) full of classic songs, and the film is full of audacious numbers to match them. I could easily be convinced that this film was made for upwards of $25 million. But obviously, style isn't dictated by budget (the film was made for $6 million). Just look at 'Wig in a Box,' where a trailer wall is kicked down to become a stage. Or 'Angry Inch', where Hedwig's bold retelling of his past lashes out and causes the whole place to erupt. The music could've easily been tacky, but no. The songs, written by Stephen Trask, are punk rock masterpieces (some highlights including 'Origin of Love', 'Midnight Radio' and 'Wig in a Box') that had me singing for days after. I am now convinced that the music industry would be on its way to redemption if more people could write with the gusto and originality of Stephen Trask's work. The film's characters all have stunning emotional depth. Every character is developed, the relationships seem real, and they are all acted to perfection. That there is already more than you can say about most rock musicals. 'Hedwig' is the brainchild of John Cameron Mitchell. He knows 'this punk rock star' up and down and thus turns in a near flawless performance. Hedwig is bitter, stubborn and sarcastic, but never unpleasant for the audience to be with. Michael Pitt is impressive as the rip-off artist Tommy Gnosis, and Miriam Shor gives a wonderfully layered performance as Yitzak, Hedwig's husband/wife obviously unsure of her place in the world (just like Hedwig herself). 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch' has done what no other rock musical has done before. It refuses to give up the music for the story, or vice versa. Instead, the songs complement Hedwig's journey in such a way that we understand her position even more after each one. Now only one question remains: is 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch' the greatest rock musical ever made? Hell, yeah.",10,2,3,23 February 2002
A Beautiful Mind," An Uncompromising Snapshot of a Schizophrenic's Life
","RATING:  ***1/2 out of ****
On the surface, 'A Beautiful Mind' is a biopic of John Nash, one of America's great mathematicians. But that statement is misleading. 'A Beautiful Mind' is not a film that paints a big, sweeping portrayal of the events of one man' life. Instead, in the way that Ed Harris did last year with 'Pollock', Ron Howard gives the viewer a more personal look at the subject of the film. Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman don't take the easy route and merely dramatize everything that Nash accomplished, for that would really only be a two-hour way of saying 'Won Nobel Prize for...' They let us get to know Nash as only those who were closest to him knew him, and most remarkably show us how his mind processed and who he was.
John Nash (Russell Crowe) is a math student studying at Princeton College. His friends are studying and building on the works of what he considers to be 'lesser mortals', while what he really wants to do is come up with a truly original idea. He spends his time alone, trying to find definitive patterns to everyday movements, games, etc. He gets encouragement from his roommate Charles (Paul Bettany), but I'll jump the gun a little and tell you this is where the trouble starts. Suddenly, he does find his original idea, and it is so revolutionary that he is given a grant to study/teach at MIT. There, he meets Alicia, a student of his that he has begun to court. The two get married a while later, but during this time, Alicia doesn't see that Nash is being plagued by delusions, one a CIA operative (Parcher, played by Ed Harris) who enlists him on a 'top secret mission' to try and discover secret encoded messages in periodicals supposedly being sent out by Russian spies. His empty quest starts to devour him, as he dreams of the Russians coming after him and other secret forces closing in. Alicia begins to notice that something is definitely wrong, and starts to help her husband try and realize what is real and what isn't. 'A Beautiful Mind' is a solid, powerful drama. I'll re-iterate that it doesn't tell us everything about John Nash, and sometimes that irked me. I admit I did not know much about John Nash's accomplishments, and going out, I wasn't in the least bit enlightened on that front. His supposedly breakthrough work on game theory goes relatively unexplained here, and that was one thing in the film that could have used a little tweaking. However, this is about the man, not the work. Many people have complained about the film's ignorance towards Nash's bisexuality, and I would have to disagree with them to an extent. There are moments in where bisexuality is most definitely hinted at. This would be more of a problem if the film was not so obviously trying to focus on Nash's paranoid schizophrenia, something that is portrayed magnificently. Akiva Goldsman has fashioned his screenplay in such a way that we are put in Nash's shoes, and then brought to see a more objective view. At first, we have little idea as to what Nash's delusions are, they all blend into reality seamlessly. Then, they start to get more outrageous, and when Nash's fears of these images start to be brought out into the public, we start to look at him from another viewpoint. However, we feel for him, because we have seen what he is going through, and we feel for those affected by him (especially Alicia) because he has become so out of touch with the world.
This film is a prime example of what Russell Crowe can do when he's not out toga partying with Ridley Scott. He gives one of his best performances, portraying the schizophrenia without over-doing it or milking moments for their dramatic value. Another actor might immediately approach the subject grimly and teary-eyed, but Nash at first cannot realize what he is seeing does not exist, so why should he be afraid? Jennifer Connelly gives the other extraordinary performance in the film. Connelly has been one of the most under-appreciated and hardest working actresses in the business, and it is wonderful that she will now get the recognition she deserves for her powerful, passionate portrayal of Alicia Nash. 'A Beautiful Mind' is compelling film that never stoops to endorse melodrama or over-acting. It doesn't get all the details of John Nash's life in, that much is true, but it doesn't need to. It has a purpose, and it executes it in magnificent form. It is a fine, intricately constructed vision of paranoid schizophrenia and a man who had the will to defeat it. And although skeptics will attack it until the cows come home, the truth is that 'Mind' is beautiful.",8,0,1,23 February 2002
Amélie," A nice little film
","Rating: ***1/2 out of ****What a fun film! From the moment it begins, 'Amelie' bursts with joy and energy. It's a fable of sorts, a love letter to a Paris fondly dreamt of by many. It may not be the real world, but it is such a delightful fantasy that it doesn't matter how unbelievable some of it may be. 'Amelie' is the rare romantic comedy that has both the romance and the comedy. It isn't very surprising that this has been a hit in France for a while now, and I have no doubt it will find the audience it needs in the States as well.
Amelie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) is a nave girl working at the Two Windmills Caf. When she was a child her mother and teacher was an innocent victim of a suicide gone awry. Amelie stayed with her father until she was old enough to leave and lead a life of her own. One day she finds a small box of treasures behind a tile in her wall, she decides to return it to her owner and become a natural do-gooder. Later on, she catches a man groping for lost photos under a photo booth (Nino Quincampoix, played by Mathieu Kassovitz), and it's love at first sight. She decides to go on a quest to find this man and help anyone she can along the way (including her father and co-workers).
I said before that this film was a love letter to Paris, it is also a love letter to Amelie herself. Jean-Pierre Jeunet (director and co-screenwriter) conjured the film like a dream, as if Amelie is his dream girl and he is trying to save her and bring her to a happy ending. It's not hard to want everything to work out for her and her friends. Amelie Poulain is the kind of person who you wish was your best friend, your neighbor or your sister. She bounces along with good grace and whimsy living life to its fullest, yet keeping a mischievous grin. She has her own idea of justice that isn't very disagreeable. The tormentors must in turn be tormented; the lifeless must be brought to life. The film is like a non-musical 'Bells Are Ringing', with our heroine bringing so much life to those around her but neglecting her wants and needs.After seeing Audrey Tautou as Amelie, I can't possibly imagine anyone else in that role. She embodies Amelie like no one else could, she is a rare find that pulls off the job of breathing life into Amelie in spades. Wait, I take that back. She does not just breathe life into Amelie, Tautou makes her jump off the screen and pull the audience into the story. It would be a crime for her not to get a Best Actress nomination for her role.
Magical is the world that Amelie lives in, where photos and lamps come alive to aid her quest, where TV shows are showing nothing but her story. The story this setting surrounds is pretty standard, and presented plainly could have just been another machine-processed romantic comedy. Is it too sappy? No. On the contrary, the film takes quite a few steps to make sure it doesn't become tacky or conventional. The rich, storybook setting and a witty screenplay (asides are taken to deepen our connection each character, little things that each likes and dislikes) make the film all the more a delight to watch. The cinematography, crafted by Bruno Delbonnel, does wonders for 'Amelie'. The camera captures the action with an eye of a child in a candy store, beautifully bringing about each shot as a new discovery.
With films like 'The Widow of Saint-Pierre', 'With a Friend Like Harry' and box-office hit 'Brotherhood of the Wold', French cinema has had quite a year. It's a delight that we round off the year with 'Amelie', a fresh, funny journey that could have easily just been more Meg Ryan-esque romantic comedy fodder. If not for anything else, see it for Tautou's performance, but prepare to be smothered in a dream world.",8,111,189,11 January 2002
