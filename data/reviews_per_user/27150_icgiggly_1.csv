United 93," Why Flight 93 is soooo much better than United 93
","Flight 93 was amazing. I accidentally rented out United 93 when I wanted to watch this movie for the fourth time with my friends, and seriously every second I was noticing places where Flight 93 did it better. I almost cried with this movie, since it really brings you into the lives of the people who were involved - both on the plane and off, as in the families and all the tearful conversations and goodbyes. When I was watching United 93 I felt like I was watching a documentary. There was barely any emotion in it. Almost the whole thing takes place on the ground in that big airplane controller room with the tvs, and even only towards the middle do some people BEGIN freaking out - up until wayy into the movie no one was even excited, and it was very very boring to me. To me the whole thing was boring, because there was no emotion in it, and after seeing Flight 93, I knew what the story was, and I knew what happened, so seeing a documentary with a little bit more info on the behind the scenes from the controller room was absolutely boring. I watched the movie hoping it would get better but it didn't. The thing is, it probably is possible for people to like United 93, because maybe it could be good, but just not after Flight 93, which I feel may give you an even better grasp of what actually happened that day, and it really makes you cry. It just delivers such a stronger message, and is really amazing all the way through. I saw some comment on United 93 saying something like 'the last 15 minutes make you cry!!' I did not cry a bit, or even get close to crying! While with Flight 93, the emotion is there, the whole movie, so obviously you cry at the horrible ending!! I feel that the reason someone would cry at the end of United 93 is just because they feel sad about that actual day, and not because the movie itself actually had such a big effect that it made them cry. I admit, maybe United 93 was more 'Hollywood', maybe because it had more big music or something, or maybe it has some more common actors? I don't know, but if anyone wants to use the fact that Flight 93 had no famous actors in it as a reason to prove it's not big - I bought the DVD, and in the behind the scenes thing they explained that although they totally could have had all the famous actors play in the movie, they specifically chose the unknown ones so that it would look more real and it would look more like actual people were dying and not just some actor in another movie. But I was very surprised though that all these actors were unknown, because everyone's acting in this movie was amazing - truly undiscovered talent. All around, Flight 93 had the perfect script, the perfect actors, and all around the perfect technique to make an amazing movie, and while United 93 might have the Hollywood name, Flight 93 is without a doubt twenty times better.",3,0,7,26 July 2008
