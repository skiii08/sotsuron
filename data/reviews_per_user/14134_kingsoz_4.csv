Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Embarassing!
","I would like to say that I 'AM' a star wars fan.  I loved the original trilogy.  They have 'class', which is more than i can say for this piece of JUNK.How dare they introduce a character such as JAR JAR BINKS??!!!!! He destroyed this film. He has no personality, he is very annoying, very cheesy/corny and he looks like a cartoon! He is embarassing to watch.Also the dialogue in this film, expecially during the space battle scenes was very basic, as if it were out of a comic book.  I can't believe George Lucas waited about 16 years and this is all he could come up with! Rubbish I do not recomment it.Goodbye!! P.S. Damn you Jar Jar Binks.!",4,0,1,28 August 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," OVERRATED AND A BIT SILLY
","I read all the reviews and it sounded like it was going to be a fabulous film, and it also won 4 oscars! This just had to be great.  I saw it with my uncle and it didn't really excite me.  I agree the Cinematography deserves an oscar, but the rest of the film is a bit dull and confusing and doesn't just go anywhere.  Also i hate the way people fly! It seemed like i was watching a Superman movie or something.  How could this film be compared to Gladiator? Noway!! Gladiator has heart and soul, excitement and a very good ending. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is very boring and childish and has the worst ending that i could expect. I thought there was going to be a big fight or something, but no... that weird chinese girl commits suicide! dull or what?! The music is just rubbish. How could it have won an oscar for music over gladiator?, something wrong with the academy there! Because of all the hype and high ratings, i will go the opposite and give it 2/10. Watch it at your own risk.",1,0,3,7 June 2001
Shrek," Brilliant!
","i have to admit, this is the funniest and best animated feature i have ever seen.  I did notice that the humour was NOT 'cheesy', which is a very very very good thing.  It was very simple humour, which at some times were quite adult, but that's the way we like it!It visually looks stunning.  The scenery, the characters and also the voices are perfect.  I would recommend it to anybody who has eyes, ears and a heart.",10,1,2,10 July 2001
Gladiator," Absolute Perfection and Class
","i have to say this movie is literally perfect.  From acting to story, from music to cinematography and from special effects to anything else a film can be judged on it is just brilliant. it is a pure epic.  This is not your cheapo action summer flick like X-men. Everything has been thought out so well, and choice for all the actors and actresses were spot on, since i think nobody could have pulled it off as well as the main man Russell Crowe, which i like to say 'well done' for receiving his oscar. From the opening scene of the wheat field, you know its a film which is going to be emotional and deep, and when the first battle appears, you know its going to be loud and fast moving.  This film has just one of the best endings i have ever seen (i won't say just incase you haven't seen it)Believe me it has it all, you will not be disappointed.'What we do in life, echoes in eternity'...so go and watch and enjoy!",10,0,0,17 May 2001
