The Longest Yard," The Longest Music Video: MTV's negative effect on Sandler's new comedy
","I knew I was in trouble when I saw that MTV helped produce this film during the opening credits. In normal MTV fashion, it took Sandler's film and tried to make it into a giant music video. If you think I'm kidding, just watch the credits and you will realize that there are over 30 random songs played throughout the film. Further, the multiple screens during the football game and the overabundance of super slow motion during football practice add to the overall music video effect. This takes away from the story and, more importantly, takes away from the Adam Sandler humor we all know and love (or at least the humor that people who go to see this movie love). Though this movie was not up to par with the comedic zaniness of Sandler's past movies, it would have been much better without MTV's influence. It bothers me that the music video industry is having such an impact on cinema (even if it is only clearly visible in summer teenager comedies). This being said, 'The Longest Yard' (2005) was funny and worth seeing if you're looking for easy laughs and an adrenaline rush. Sandler and Rock make a good duo, and Burt Reynolds (who played Sandler's character in the original) is an inspiring coach. I just wish MTV didn't get its talons into this film.",7,0,0,5 June 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Episode III: What more do you want? C'mon!
","Alright, so the prequels weren't the best thing since the original trilogy, but what could be? I can tell you one thing: out of all of the prequels, Episode III had the best writing, acting, action, and computer animation. Though many fans believe that still isn't saying much (and to an extent I agree), Episode III fulfilled all of my expectations. If it didn't for you, then all you have to do is look at the film from an overall saga point of view and realize that not only does it effectively show Anakin Skywalker's downfall, but it also successfully sets up Episode IV-VI. Anyone who has ever seen an interview with George Lucas knows that the saga is about Anakin and as hard as it was to watch a 9 year old boy whine about being cold in space, Episode III was worth all of it. Lucas gave fans the ultimate film with one of the darkest tragedies in film history (as well as one of the best 20 minute CGI battle sequences ever created). If you were angry because you didn't get to see Darth Vader kill people in his suit....um.....what the hell happened in almost every scene of Episodes IV-VI? Huh? Yeah, how many higher ups strangled to death slowly for our enjoyment? LOTS. Further, Obi-Wan died by getting chopped in half in super slow mo. And who could forget Jek Porkins? Wait...Darth had nothing to do with that one, but it was pretty funny. Anyway, Episode III was an emotional, exhilarating film that not only gave us a visual extravaganza but also an epic story that impacted a generation of moviegoers while forever changing 'a galaxy far, far, away....'",9,2,6,4 June 2005
