Blade Runner 2049," Fantastic movie!
","9.5 actually. IMDb doesn't allow greater thans.......but never mind, this film is great. Close to perfect.Movies, like food recipes, call for the right ingredients, in the right proportions, mixed in the right way, with attention to the final seasoning to bring out the subtle nuances of flavor. Excellent script, acting, directing, sets, special effects, lighting, sound, editing.....all assembled with care and cleverness make BR2049 one of the best. Not much to dislike here.As sequels go, it's hard to find ones that are that much better than the original, especially when the original was already declared a classic....this is one of them.The weak spots are few. I only saw it once, and I'd have to study it a second time to find the flaws more accurately. Overall it's extremely well done. I wasn't really taken with Jared Leto's character-----an actor whose skill I greatly admire----but for some reason he just didn't win me over in this role, and I think it was the character as written, not Leto. Again, if I watched this another time I might find my opinion changed on this. Maybe it was because I just didn't like what that character represented....and it had nothing to do with Leto's take on it at all. There is not enough backstory on his character to give us a full sense of what he is...how he came to be. We're left in the dark with Niander Wallace.That they incorporated many elements of the original, and updated them amazingly, allows viewers who have seen the original a feeling of familiarity...even though the ambiance had altered so much---akin to seeing an old friend years later and under very different circumstances but wearing the same shirt as last time you'd seen them.The mood, tone, of this movie is quite dark: sunlight has been in this dystopic future time replaced by interior lighting and most of the time it is either dark or getting darker outside. Lots of rain, even snow keep the atmosphere unsettled. The murkiness sets the stage for the constant emotional /and/ knowledge uncertainty that haunts Ryan Gosling's lead role. He's seeking answers, but he only gradually comes to understanding what it is he has been seeking. There's a good bit of metaphor in this: Gosling's character could well be explained as everyman searching for his meaning in creation, his purpose in being. He could as well be said to be in a constant struggle to find himself....yet finding himself doesn't necessarily provide the awareness he was hoping to discover. In the original Bladerunner there were a couple of touches that really got me-- --like the scene where Deckard takes the snake to a dealer who scans it with a high-powered microscope and sees a serial number----making what appears to be a real reptile a manmade one. That blew me away. In this sequel we are already past that science...now taken for granted. Still, there is an analogous scene in BR2049, and it's incorporated well into the plot. Speaking of plot: I never give away spoilers in movies, figuring I wouldn't want someone to tell me if I hadn't yet seen the movie....but I can say the plot is well conceived, has continuity--and continuity with the original, and has just enough twist to keep the audience guessing. Good script, overall.Like a well-prepared and cooked meal, the movie should satisfy most sci-fi fans. I left the theater a bit awed by it. Happy. A good movie, like a good book, leaves one feeling better for having seen it. I did.Someone told me the original cut had been almost 4 hrs long. I would gladly have sat through the 4 hour version. I didn't want it to end.",9,2,9,4 November 2017
Requiem for a Dream," GREAT Horror Movie !!
","Requiem For A Dream is one of most powerful movies I've seen. Watching it scared me. It's listed as drama, but when fear is the overwhelming emotion it arouses, it is to me a horror movie, as was 'The Hotel Rwanda,' another movie that frightened me....that one based on a real life event, RFAD based on the fictional novel of the same name by Hubert Selby, Jr. Not for the faint of heart....extremely challenging to watch-----many times I wanted to look away, to have the movie stop, but could not pull myself away from watching.... high drama.Here once again in cinematic history we have one of THE most amazing acting roles by male or female -- Ellen Burstyn's character of Sara Goldfarb--not given the public accreditation it deserved. That year,2001, the Oscar went to Julia Roberts for her title role in the movieErin Brockovich--- which is akin to having given the Indy 500 trophy to the car that came in 5 laps after the lead car crossed the finish. The two acting performances are so far apart---Burstyn's simply incredibly excellent, Robert's merely so-so------that they aren't comparable. Why Burstyn did not get the Academy award for this performance is...disheartening. It's almost as if Hollywood is shallow, and money-driven...?....you think?Burstyn's performance blew me away. Every now and then we have an actor rise in a role to a level beyond what most actors are capable: such a performance was given by Kevin Bacon in Rocco's 1995 film 'Murder In The First.' I usually am not that enthused by Bacon's acting (sorry, Kevin) who can't seem to get out of his own way, but in this role he was spectacularly beyond himself. His character took on a persona all to itself. Similarly, Burstyn's Sara Goldfarb has a lifeforce rarely seen on screen. She went through such astounding shifts to create all of that urban mother's angst...!! I could not take my eyes away from her expressive, pain-riddled face: one scene, a hospital scene which focuses on her face, is as hallucinogenic as any I've ever seen heightened by altered lighting, color, and accelerated timing. Truly disturbing.... truly GREAT cinema. The other actors are fantastic. Not a bad dramatic scene to be had. Leto, Wayans, and Connelly wear their hearts on their sleeves, and Aronofsky's direction is superb at allowing them to display that rawness. This is a movie about destruction, about loss of the self, about delusion, and failed hopes, coupled to the damaging effects of chemicals/drugs. For very good reason Burstyn's character reminds me of that amazing scene in 'Ironweed' where Streep's Helen Archer drunkenly takes a stage to sing and imagines herself acclaimed successful...juxtaposed against the reality of no one caring. Failed visions, delusional thinking, brain-damaged perceptions---all brought to the screen extremely well in this powerful film by Aronofsky. Burstyn should have received that Oscar, hands down. As good a performance as any you'll see. I give this movie a 9+.",9,0,1,19 May 2013
In Bruges," A Most Interesting Blend
","I think what impressed me most about this movie is something the actors all say in the one bonus feature of the DVD: it captures and expresses the humanity of the characters no matter what they may be or do. Somehow even in the worst of behavior they are still very real, very human, very complex, flawed and noble simultaneously. I really like this film. I liked the premise: two shady guys from the 20th Century on the lam in a perfectly preserved Medieval city whose sureness of architectural line and composition stands in stark contrast to their uncertainty and fear and collective guilt. The stately orderly beauty of the buildings which sit on the cobble stone streets or border the canal with its swans which wends its way through the heart of the city of Bruges and passes under its many small arched bridges create a sense of composure and timelessness. A sense of time frozen as in a Master painting . . . The setting of Bruges as calm backdrop to these frenzied visitors is quite purposeful for the writer/director to allow the mood of incongruity to add to the dark humor. One doesn't really see the trappings of modernity at all. Cars and trucks are almost nonexistent, and even though the boats have motors you don't hear them. It could well be the 14th Century. What we hear instead is the noise of the invading people whose orderliness is fairly nonexistent. The background is still, the people in motion, an emphasis of the tension within the characters. I believe that nothing here is brand new but cleverly adapted by Martin McDonagh from certain works. While not a cut and paste of other offerings, it borrows heavily from works that are cited either directly or indirectly and most notably the 1970 British film 'Performance,' which featured a criminal on the lam hiding in a very strange old mansion inhabited by people living a lifestyle very different than the one he knew. Part of the allure of that film was that strange juxtaposition of personae who seemed from other worlds. The other work that 'In Bruges' borrows from is Roeg's classic 'Don't Look Now' which featured a child/dwarf and the canaled streets and empty facades of the ancient buildings of Venice. Where that movie had a creepiness, this one transposes humor and a dark lightness. Where Roeg used the ambiance of Venice to create an insecurity for characters and audience, the lovely tranquility of Bruges serves to calm the viewer, even though the on screen characters are running at emotional redline. It is also worth noting that the citizens of Bruges are portrayed mostly as in neutral, non-involved. Even when things get out of hand, they maintain a calm very much at odds with the adrenalized British/Irish protagonists. It is most clever how McDonagh takes us into a movie within a movie while paying homage to the fantasied works of Heironymus Bosch. He suggests that there may a quantity of insanity in the film industry with its fictional depiction of reality, and that no one is immune from being part of that distorted sanity who is participating in any way with cinema, whether as makers, actors, or spectators. His replication through costuming of Bosch figures into the film within film also suggests that every work of art only issues from the mind of a creator, fiction given form.What is well done is McDonagh's use of language. His script sparkles and breathes strongly. None of the lines delivered by any of the characters fail to delight. He pokes fun at language through his characters' use of certain words and phrases, such as 'alcove' to mean 'nooks and crannies.' A great deal of the likability of this movie for me comes from the script, and I might say that I acted pre-emptively and put on the captioning when I realized that the characters were speaking British English which is far different than American English. It helped to see, and hear what they were saying the better to not miss the nuances of a well done script.Cast is very good. Most impressive was Brendan Gleeson, who has a truly wonderful camera presence here. Fiennes is very very good as gang leader Harry Water, (another nod to Roeg's criminal boss in 'Performance,' Harry Flowers), while Farrell does an admirable job all the way through. Farrell obviously enjoyed himself on this one. There were a couple of times when his facial contortions went places I don't think Farrell knew where they were. Great fun.Rest of cast did what they had to do, and did it well. Lighting, mood, sound were all supportive and well placed. Overall, a very nice dark comedy, and one well worth recommending to others. Given the beauty of the background scenery, I wish I had seen this in a theater, not on DVD at home. Still beautiful on the small screen. A bit bloody though, not for the squeamish or young children. Grade 9 stars.",9,1,3,3 February 2009
Gravity," Unbelievable.
","Sorry, Sandra and George, the film is just too incredible to be a good film. It's like making a movie about circus lion tamers and showing the introduction of a new and savagely ferocious feral lion into whose jaws the lion tamer then instantly proceeds to safely put his head and after leaving his head inside the lion's jaws for more than ten minutes pulls away as the jaws snap shut and the crowd roars its approval. Not believable. The reality would be a headless, eaten human corpse and an angry feral lion seeking both its freedom and more victims.This movie stretched reality so far beyond the breaking point that I could NOT like it. I did like the absolutely gorgeous CGI special effects....very powerfully done, very beautiful.I did not like the CGI special effects for their absolute breach of credulity.I usually like the acting of Clooney and even to some degree, although she is far from being a strong actress in my esteem, that of Sandra Bullock. But here I found Clooney a clichéd version of some of the many characters he's played: insouciant at times, self-absorbed at times, seemingly in control even when all conditions indicate a total lack of control---in essence he was too much Clooney in Space for the horror of what was unfolding for his and Bullock's characters.I didn't believe in his character.Bullock is very limited in her ability to convey strong fear---which was necessary here----my primary objection to her role playing in Gravity. Might another actress been better? Sure, but they would have been stuck in the same surreal and incredible CGI imagery as was Bullock. But someone else who could more authentically project emotions would have been better than her.I do not wish to write a review with spoilers in it, and in this I am not as able to convey most of my criticism of the special effects and the script. . . .but this is where I most dislike the movie. Things such as running out of oxygen and then continuing to breathe and function for five more minutes, or being burnt alive yet being unscathed aren't exactly the stuff of realism----but this entire movie is built on such staggeringly overt bloopers. Is it any wonder I didn't like it?'Gravity' watches like a good short story reads. There are enough twists and turns to keep the viewer intrigued and just as there is an intensity in the short story form---a compression of dramatic action that allows the short story to be very powerful and memorable ---so it is with 'Gravity.'So the movie does have an intensity . . . which is why many people will like it, regardless its awful script shortcomings and errors. But a good short story invites the willing reader to believe in the protagonist's plight . . .and if that belief isn't there, the story suffers as a result.Such is the case with this movie---it just isn't believable enough to allow me to buy into it. Had they toned down the severity of the near misses, reduced the repeated number of escapes from sure-death scenarios I think it would have been much more believable, and far more powerful a movie.Color me unconvinced.",7,1,5,9 October 2013
Inglourious Basterds," Adolescent Fantasy
","It is interesting that the day after I saw this movie, I saw a B/W WWII movie, 'Sahara,' with Humphrey Bogart in the lead role. It was a much better movie to me than the pretentious interpretation of war savagery envisioned by Tarantino. That 1943 movie had a quality of realism Tarantino's did not: the action was plausible, the actors seemed like actual humans. Tarantino's movie is for all intents and purposes a video game rendered in cinematic form. I can understand why it appeals to many; like a video game, it has its intriguing moments. A lot of people like hardcore video games. A lot of people like the violence in video games...On the plus side, there are some true strengths to IB. The lighting, and color, and camera work are at times very very good. But they are not consistent: Tarantino must have watched WWII movies before making this and occasionally mimics the static single angle camera, almost as homage to those films. There is one shot of Laurent bathed in the light of the projectors worthy capture for a museum.... Truly beautiful cinema at times. The acting is wonderful. Brad Pitt shines: his charicatured good ol' boy from the American south never falters. Chris Waltz's 'Jew Hunter' evil SS man should place in Oscar contention for Best Supporting actor, he's excellent. The entire cast is very very good. Taratino's writing (if he in fact is the writer... Tarantino has used others' talent previously and claimed it as his own) sparkles. Laurent is also most believable as the French cinema owner with an ax to grind.I only wish Tarantino was more grounded as a human being. His puerile fantasy could easily have been a more credible movie. What he has produced is art, but it is not art rendered by a mature artist with polished composition. My complaint is his inability to create anything with serious depth. His movie works on many levels but fails totally on one in particular: credibility. Damn shame, that. Work this good deserves to be taken to that next level. And even though Tarantino will disavow that his intent is anything more than reveling in movie making and the glorification of cinema, I don't believe him. I don't think he is capable of taking a movie to that missing realism---it is missing in him. On a personal note, I also believe that QTarantino is incapable of understanding human suffering past an intellectual construct of it. He is so cerebral he studies human cruelty just as a child pulls wings off a fly without any empathic sense of the event. Those who enjoy violence, cruelty, won't get this themselves, but there is strong rationale for making violence hideous since we are already so desensitized to it. Tarantino will himself not understand what I just suggested. I don't think he feels as much he thinks about feelings. He lives in his head, not his heart. Empathy is for Tarantino an abstract concept.I give this movie a 7.5 . . . . it is in ways much better than that but the storyline left me wishing for more so much so it detracted from my final experience. Tasty with the first mouthful, but a little bland after the final swallow.",7,2,6,23 December 2009
Star Trek Into Darkness," Brilliant At Times, Overblown At Others
","It seems the people associated with the legacy of Gene Roddenberry can never find the power themselves 'to go where no man has gone before' (which sounds awfully sexist even as I write it)....Many of the Star Treks are only rehashes of previous Star Trek shows, or rehashes of Star Trek movies, or rehashes of rehashes of either----a common theme to Star Trek movie scripts. This one's no different. And, it's not only a rehash of previous Star Treks, but it also rips off key plot from another movie, K-19 The Widowmaker.I truly loved 2009's Star Trek movie (NOTE: perhaps the one true exception to the lack of novelty which afflicts the ST genre) which introduced us to the young persona of the TV show cast. It was an excellent movie, though there were times when it stretched credibility. One thing that a movie, even a fantasy sci-fi, ought to respect is biological limitations: when we see a person in a serious fight receiving numerous blows from objects, fists, feet, elbows----and then we see them with virtually NOTHING showing as damaged (no bruises, cuts, scrapes, swelling, etc)...it loses me. I really want some verisimilitude here. Any movie which involves physical harm should show the induced harm and unless there is some form of accelerated healing ---which is part of the cover story Star Trekkers will advance--- the sequelae of the fight ought to be as realistic as possible. Jack Nicholson's character had his nose cut in 'Chinatown' and wore a misfitting face bandage for quite a while. It was appropriate, and it engendered more of a sympathy for his kindred humanity. The more we can identify with the sufferings of characters, the more we can feel for their travails....the more we can project ourselves vicariously into their travails.But ---when there is a terribly violent fight....and the person suddenly stands up and dusts themselves off and looks unscathed....the reality has been compromised at a very visceral level.I have two primary objections to this movie and both involve the extremely unrealistic nature of recovery after battle damage, both to the characters and to the vessels they occupy.I refuse to ever give out details that would constitute spoiler for those who haven't seen a movie, and I find myself constrained here to not say more than generalization. Which is too bad. It would be nice to take the real key scenes to which I most object and detail why they so offend. But I won't.On the very plus side we have some excellent acting. It is difficult to fault any of the acting in this movie, it's that good. Camera work is at times gorgeously beautiful. The opening sequence itself I thought glorious. The city scapes are the stuff of an architect's wet dreams. The CGI digital sequences flawlessly and seamlessly flow. I love the 3D for movies like this.Overall, what I felt was that the movie started very very well, moved to some very nice plot complications and maintained a high level of tension effectively for the viewer, but ended somewhat weakly-------had they been able to keep that same strength throughout the entirety of the movie I would have given it a 9....but because of the failure to observe simple biological boundaries, and because the plot attenuated toward the end I could only give it a 7. Liked it a lot, but didn't love it. Vastly preferred Star Trek (2010).",7,3,13,17 May 2013
Interstellar," Not All That Great
","It was okay. I liked some parts better than some others. It didn't seem that believable. It really didn't make sense in the final analysis. It was a beautiful exercise in filmmaking----but plot-wise I thought it contrived, far-fetched, not that rational, too facile, and more like a good road trip movie that just happened to be somewhere outside the galaxy.Quite honestly I liked the movie, but I didn't love the movie. Once again, as in the film 'Gravity' there were things that stretched credulity to the breaking point. Too many times things went wrong....and got salvaged somehow against all odds. I mean, making a swish jump shot from the other basket CAN be done-----but doing it FIVE times in the same game without missing even once? That's how ridiculous the survival of the two protagonist voyagers struck me. Example: Believable was Damon and his craft getting blown to hell------ Not-Believable was docking with the remnant of the ship....(which somehow survived all the shrapnel of the explosion), somehow docking with it as it spun at high speed, and somehow making it work. This sort of thing occurred repeatedly.If you want me to get caught up in scifi-----make it believable scifi. Give it enough possibility to allow me to suspend disbelief. That was not the case with this movie.Excellent acting. Fry, playing the daughter, is a beauty and a good actress. McConaughey, Hathaway, Chastain, Lithgow, Caine, etc all excellent in their roles. Great cinematography by Van Hoytema. Music by Hans Zimmer fit. Some of the planetary sets were absolutely wonderful, otherworldly indeed.Plot by the Nolans, though---- just not that credible.Overall, a good movie, and one with enough twists and spins to engage viewers into seeing it again in an attempt to make better sense of it, or to interpret it into something closer to the language called Logic.A beautiful movie, well crafted. . .lacking only credibility.",8,1,4,10 November 2014
Nightcrawler," American Psycho Metaphor
","Dan Gilroy's version of American Psycho has Jake Gyllenhaal moving from fringe social outcast to a powerbroker gaining a foothold in TV broadcasting.It is quite clear that his character, Lou Bloom, fits all the parameters of being a true psychopath: highly intelligent, analytic, narcissistic, completely lacking both empathy and conscience ---yet by dint of these very 'talents' he is able to ascend on the social ladder.This movie succeeded for me because it made me so, so nervous....so anxious...even when almost nothing was happening on the screen action----it was Gyllenhaal's character that triggered this reaction in me.From the first time we see his smile (eerily reminiscent of the smile of Malcolm McDowell's 'Alex' in 'A Clockwork Orange'---containing superficially an innocence but masking the murderous snarl beneath) when he is approached by a security guard, smiles at the guard, sees the guard's fancy wristwatch.....and in the next moment suddenly attacks that guard and we see Bloom then wearing that watch, now 'his'--- there is menace written all over Bloom. At any given instant in this film there is that conveyed risk that the heartless animal caged within Bloom will emerge. . .yet all there is to this is innuendo. Threat. The possibility looming at all times.I believe this is where the movie derives its power. All is based on suggestion...as I watched the movie my discomfort increased. I didn't know where it was going, or how it was going to get there----it didn't matter: just the fact that this character was among us was enough to keep me on edge.As monsters go, this Lou Bloom one is very understated. Where Easton's character in 'American Psycho' committed the most horrifying travesties against his fellow humans (whether in deed or thought---and the most of which were omitted from the movie version of AmerPyscho because it would have been far too graphic for normal sensitivity) this Bloom psycho has more to do with the transmission of his social deviancy to society ...of finding ways to convey that sense of mayhem and gore that ignites his inner flame. He is both voyeur, and salesman of the dark side of humanity macabre, and delights in successfully spreading this gospel to the masses.And of course it is tied to profits. To say that his character is the corporate personification of the network news, and to corporate personhood in general---in which all that is human is subverted to business profit---- is to state the obvious. Dan Gilroy's gift here is to reveal through his character of Lou Bloom how he perceives the insanity of the broadcast sensationalism TV news that has replaced the checkout line shock-selling tabloids that mainstreamed pulp fiction to the more innocent consuming masses.That society is being changed, being rendered less shocked and more enured to the savagery isn't openly stated, but undercurrent as we gather that ratings have increased to the display of gore.Only in the screaming female detective do we see a realistic reaction to what this character represents and is doing....to others he is perfectly acceptable, a charming success.Bloom's character has no feelings toward anyone, even though he looks as though he is earnest and serious--- which we hear in one small speech he gives menacingly to Nina (Rene Russo, Gilroy's real life wife) who has thoroughly whored herself against her better judgement to Bloom ----when he tells Nina angrily he expects her to do whatever he wants unquestioningly ('...not like last time in the bedroom') as his power and persuasion grow beyond all reason.Great acting by Gyllenhaal....I hope he wins awards for it.A masterful production. A metaphor most powerfully captured. My hat's off to Gilroy and company for this wonderful----if difficult to watch----homage to corporate psychopathy.",9,1,4,5 November 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Not So Great
","Special effects in XMDOFP are amazing as we've come to expect from modern big screen 3D bonanzas.But the story line is weak. And that's why I can't rate this movie higher. It just doesn't cut the cerebral mustard. Unsatisfying to me, in the end....I wanted it to be more, and it didn't deliver it. But I am certain that to other viewers it was quite satisfying. It's a well done piece of cinema.The movie plot borrows from a number of others (Star Trek '09, Inception, The Matrix, Terminator 2) . . . and wasn't consequently that original. This is too bad. Given the budget and acting talent they had they could have come up with something a little more interesting ...and they should have.I believe Singer was aspiring to achieve a genuine comic book look....and the attacks of the Sentinels with energy of all kinds being thrown around, he succeeded. However, it was for me too much of a good thing....I found them a bit too weird. Still, the CGI special effects are on a par with the best that have been done. Amazing. Fantastic choreography on the fighting sequences. The movie thrives on such action.(I think it worth noting that people no longer refer to them as 'computer generated' but just 'special effects' ----the ineluctable transition toward seamless Singularity apparently on schedule) I will say that Quicksilver's actions were to my thinking the best of the movie----the scene in the kitchen of the Pentagon where he takes out all the guards and redirects the plastic bullets by first running around at warp speed: absolutely great ! A Great scene ! Quicksilver is now my favorite mutant!!Acting is topnotch. I cannot think of a poor character rendition in this....Michael Fassbender playing the young Magneto shows once again why he is one of today's very elite cinema faces....he has a power to hold the camera, to capture the viewer's attention---the mark of a great actor. It's a high-octane cast, and they deliver.The final plot development didn't work. Magneto's dramatic 'relocation' of the sports stadium seemed odd-----visually novel, but a strangely over-the-top ploy that seemed unnecessary. If he was trying to make a statement, he could have done it by other, less excessive means. Maybe I just don't understand how Magneto's mind works.....maybe it's me. Probably.I was hoping to be blown away by this movie....at least really pleasantly surprised by it. And I wasn't. Held back by a plot that could have been a hair stronger. Again, very good, but not great. 7.75, could we use fractions.",7,3,6,28 May 2014
Gran Torino," Simply Godawful
","For all the wonderfully good movies he's put out, it seems only fair according to the law of averages that Eastwood was due a dog.This is it.A wretchedly horrid example of bad cinema. Ordinarily I do not review movies I do not like: I am making an exception here because this movie is for some very strange reason well- received. Either those viewers who liked it have no taste (highly possible) or have truly bad taste (most probable). It is also possible I missed something here. . . . nahhhhhhh. I watched it in its entirety thinking something redemptive would pull it back from the brink of abysmal, but no such luck. It remained true to its form: egregiously bad, lamentable.Anyone who appreciates the simple formula of: Good Acting + Good Script + Good Cinematography + Credible Storyline + Good Editing = Good Movie understands instinctively this film has none of the above. The only reason it rates a lone star from me is that the movie ended. Had it continued, I would have considered suicide. So I am glad it was over, and I gave it 1 star, affirming my right to never watch it again. And to my right to live. Maybe I should have it given it 2 stars for allowing me to live . . . . nahhhhhhhhh. It was that bad.",1,8,21,13 June 2009
The Hurt Locker," Not A Very Good Movie
","Honestly. This film the best of 2009? An Oscar winning effort? Not to me. I didn't like it. It didn't engage me. The first job of a movie is to pull in the viewer. Without active participation by the viewer, the movie stays only a set of images----and like a newspaper front page can be thrown away once read. The reason I didn't feel engaged ...? The characters and situations did not seem that credible. I haven't served in the Mideast wars but it seemed to me that the situations the human was being placed into were unrealistic : in today's war room, I would think Americans relying more on robotics, and then remote detonation of explosives. So I didn't get that part of it.The characters were not that interesting to me. Maybe they were just not the type I would associate with... I don't know. These characters just didn't speak to me. The obligatory male bonding drunken fight scene left me cold. The relationship between the protagonist and the native child was a little better . . . at least I had a sense that he cared about the little boy, (or by Freudian displacement his own inner child), but at least I could identify with his feelings. In the scene when the soldiers go into a very dangerous area at night, ill-equipped, it seemed totally unreasonable. A person would have to be truly stupid to do something like that.... and the characters were not portrayed as that ignorant. So it didn't fly with me.Really . . . did ANYONE believe that this movie was a better movie than Avatar which it beat for the Academy Award? You're kidding, right? The only mark I give this movie is for its portrayal of the Iraq war as distorted and confused violence without a clear sense of ultimate outcome. In that, it succeeded in buying my belief. But not a very good movie. There are far better war movies. This wasn't Oscar material.",6,11,18,8 March 2010
Paranormal Activity," It Works!
","Not sure exactly how they did it, but as some others here have said better than I can 'less is more.' Very low budget. Only a handful of actors, two primarily, none well known. Limited set, a house. Not much else.That this film does work, is a genuine scarefest, has as much to with the lack of pretentious trappings as it does the engagement of the viewer's imagination. The house could be almost any house or duplex anywhere in the USA, and many parts of the world. The protagonists could be any young people. They're not totally nondescript, they just don't have exceptional traits calling attention to themselves. The situation-- ----strange nighttime occurrences and sounds-------is the stuff of conversation anywhere you go.So why does the film work so well?Verisimilitude. It's all credible. The actors, the set(s), the scenario, the weirdness-----all credible. It doesn't stretch the viewer with convoluted plot detail. So the midbrain stays more involved in the action than the cerebrum . . . . . thoughts are kept at a minimum, while fears are played to. By restricting thought, viewers are brought into a heightened emotional state. The viewer's visual search for something out of the ordinary on the recording video when time passes and nothing has happened keeps the endocrine system in high alert. I noted that it was difficult to NOT look at the screen at such times, and I sensed that the same was true for everyone in the theater: The movie cajoles watchfulness. When we become so attentive, we move into a different internal state, a more alert state than regular waking consciousness. This movie lulls the viewer into that state gradually and convincingly. The final effect when the movie ends is that we are left in that state: 'Deer in the Headlights' ---no one moves out of pure uncertainty, out of crippling fear.And isn't this precisely what a good horror film ought to do?I give the makers all the credit in the world. They either lucked into this one, or they're more genius than they realize. And from the profits this one is generating, they'll be able to explore their talent again.",9,2,4,29 October 2009
Elysium," I Know It's SciFi But For God's Sake How About Some Reality?
","There are some things worth liking about this movie, most of which involve some very lovely and well done visions of an orbiting colony, and the flying ships of a future time which land and take off like rocket-fired helicopters. And some robots shaped somewhat like humans. That's about it.The downside is the fakery of a person, Damon's character, exposed to a lethal dose of ionizing radiation who then is harnessed by means of surgical screws(!?!) to an exoskeleton composed of some hydraulic cylinders and although is expected to live no longer than five days does amazing acts of physical strength, is stabbed deeply in the abdomen with a long knife ---(which should have killed him), is thrown into walls at high speed, and who continues to have both stamina, strength, and full consciousness regardless how much trauma he endures.MiGod. Really???? Are we expected to believe any of this?At least in 'K-19 The Widowmaker' when the men were subjected to radiation their skin fell off and they died horrible deaths within either hours or days-----which is the typical sequela of such exposure.I so wanted to like this movie. But there were just too many other script insults to intelligence, I couldn't.The idea that the lowlife gangleader to whom our hero had to appeal for help after receiving the lethal radiation lived in a downtrodden barrio but had a virtual COMSAT intelligence room with multiple screens and could access almost any other computerized device at will as the story unfolded even when running at breakneck speed on the space station....Please. Cut us some slack here.That things happened with totally unbelievable coincidence really displayed a script desperately searching for some continuity...a good rewrite might have saved this. Probably Blomkamp ran out of time, or money, and was stuck with the faulty script and tried to cover it with some extra fight scenes. Which is really too bad. It could have been very good.Most of the acting was credible. A few characters were overdone, especially Foster's...victims again of an immature script. Overall the movie could have been so much better had they found a way to introduce some medical verisimilitude ---Damon's face didn't even have contusions after being brutalized by the arch villain of the film---and some plot credibility.I so wanted to like this film. I could not.",Null,3,6,24 August 2013
Avatar," Spectacular !!!
","Quite simply the most astounding movie I've seen as a visual experience.I am in awe.I hope Cameron makes a billion dollars for this truly amazing piece of art!Forget the people who talk about the storyline, the plot, as if it somehow fails to live up to the rest of the movie. This is a great story!--- this is sci-fi on a very high level. Is the story less than novel?----what stories aren't rehashes and blendings of other story lines...? This is a morality tale with good and bad very clearly drawn. It is a disavowal of technology and the greed that drives profit and power, and an extraordinary affirmation of the organic world, the vegetative and animal forces that constitute life.Others will comment at greater length of Cameron's rejection of man's attempt to conquer the universe by technologically violent means-----this is not that different a view than the one that drove John Borman's tale of the Brazilian native people's lives being destroyed by the advancing bulldozers in 'The Emerald Forest'----but more than that it focuses on the incapacity of those blinded by greed who cannot empathize with the sufferings of those they are harming. Cameron again is not inventing anything new, but taking a very old human story to very powerful heights. George Carlin would have loved this movie. It attacks some people as shallow and mechanistic, cruel and barbaric, narcissistically destructive... after seeing war movies for years of humans killing one another I must agree with Cameron.At one point the Na'vi are called 'blue monkeys' by the humans..... human hubris denigrating non-human lifeforms. At another point the idea that there would be sacred areas to the Na'vi is laughed at by the corporate mercenaries------as if spirituality is either non-existent or only a human trait. Yet in Cameron's world the profit-hungry humans have no concept of God or spirituality at all----they are as soulfully dead as the machines they climb into----while those who live sans technology are very strongly spiritual. They are the essence of spiritual beings fully in touch with the life streaming through and around them.Good v bad. Mechanical worldview v pantheism. Pro-life v anti-life. Cameron's movie isn't about inventing these themes, only the way he portrays them with amazing beauty and boldness. I cannot say enough about the grandiosity of this cinematic effort. It is not only groundbreaking, but the first major step into the next wave of visual entertainment. The glasses-aided 3-D is superb, entrancing. The blend of CGI and actors is as seamless as the sky . . . will this lead to 3-D in home cinema, in TV broadcasting? Cameron is marking a trail that others will undoubtedly carve more completely. Tomorrow is bright with promise.Thank you, James Cameron. I love sci-fi when it is done well, and with 'Avatar' you have done it as well as can be imagined, and better than anyone else previously has. A beautiful and timeless movie, 'Avatar.'I look forward eagerly to your future offerings.",10,21,32,27 December 2009
The Departed," An excellent work
","'The Departed' may have roots elsewhere but it translates very well to American cinema.The acting is top rate. The action well paced, and well edited. The characters realistically drawn, well cast and artfully placed in the sets. The suspense is non-stop. A more gripping movie I cannot remember. What's not to like?This is a powerful piece of cinema by a director who has created some of America's most memorable films. I agree with some others that this addition to his portfolio ought finally win Scorcese the Oscar for Best Film, unless between now and Jan 1 there is a blockbuster I don't know about. If nothing else it assures him a placesetting at the table for Best American Movie Directors . . .I loved the intensity of the character studies. The individual actors live their roles and the entire cast is experienced enough to submerge their egos. Nicholson's maniacal sociopathic Costello straddles the line between normalcy, fatherhood and family, and serial killer as if the only difference is the viewing angle. The boss lord, the heavy, he never allows you to relax when he is on screen, and creates tension with every look, every gesture. He menaces like a pit viper. I thought his best performance ever was in the movie 'Ironweed' but comparing his role there and this one is apples and oranges. Great acting.DiCaprio is absolutely marvelous. I hope he is nominated, and wins the Academy award for Best Actor for this. His previous collaboration with Scorcese in 'The Aviator' didn't receive the acclaim for his portrayal of Howard Hughes I thought it merited. He has become a polished and versatile actor and his role as Costigan allows him to show what it must feel like to be caught up in a maze of unknown but constant danger. At the same time he is trying to navigate with whatever garbled clues he can find. Matt Damon is very good. Mark Wahlberg is excellent---another actor who has grown significantly in his ability to credibly convey a character. His in-the-face detective could be a caricature in the wrong hands, but in his there's a realism. It's the realism that underpins the effectiveness of 'The Departed'---nothing seems that staged, and we're aware that the movie could possibly be cinema verite had the cameras been positioned just so. Scorcese's directoral strength may be his ability to bring that realism alive. In 'Casino' it sometimes seemed we were behind the closed doors of the action, seeing what 99.9% of the public can't. 'The Departed' looks, feels real. Scarily so. The rest of the cast is good, not quite as effective as the principles perhaps. I thought the henchmen for Costella were excellent. One of my favorite actors, Alex Baldwin, was not up to his usual excellence--more the role and what it asked of him maybe, than his acting in the role. He might've been written a little heavier, less good-natured, more serious and angry, less somewhere in the middle. Overall, the movie rates a 9.5 from me. There are a few weaknesses, such as the relationship between Costigan and Madolyn which could've been fleshed out a little more, given a little more time together on screen to deepen our sense of what they share ---this is a case where a few more minutes might've helped and the movies is such a fun ride no one would notice the time anyway. I was literally glued to the screen in a way few movies ever have captured me. Do not make the mistake of drinking a lot of water before going to this movie---you don't want to miss a minute. Definitely a classic.",10,1,2,30 October 2006
12 Years a Slave," Superb Cinema, Simply Superb
","Let me say it this way... rather than go into a more involved review: I noticed part way into the movie that I hadn't been able to take a full breath since shortly after the movie began.I also noticed that the people around me weren't, hadn't been fully breathing either.I think I did not breathe, could not breathe deeply until I was outside in the theater parking lot.What kind of movie produces such a powerful effect on viewers???A damn fine movie. One of the BEST ever. Unquestionably.My hat is off to an amazing cast, beautiful cinematography, expert editing, and an astonishing degree of authenticity difficult to capture from even an autobiographical narrative. But it all came together in this one.Did it ever !!! If this movie does not win an Academy Award for best picture, it will only be because the Academy voters have not experienced it.",10,1,3,30 November 2013
The Wolf of Wall Street," Scorcese At The Height Of His Prowess
","I can't compliment this movie enough:from start to finish it's just one extremely powerfully photographed, acted, edited piece of cinematic art.DiCaprio shows once again why he deserves to be considered one of the greatest actors...in my opinion this is his greatest work to date. He captures a character--whether it's an accurate portrayal of the actual Jordan Belfort or interpretive it doesn't matter---and stays perfectly within that character. His emotional state is always contextually spot on: he reflects the human condition about as well as it can be done. One of the things I love about DiCaprio is his underscoring vulnerability---even when he's portraying someone caught in the throes of emboldening power. In the case of Belfort that vulnerability is often buried beneath the narcissistic entitlement, but this is the power of DiCaprio's performance....that he allows us to see within, past the superficial social self, to the incomplete child self whose wants and needs drive Belfort past normal boundaries, destructively so.Supporting cast: perfect. Editing: perfect. Cinematography: perfect. Directing: perfect.I'd like to single out all the other actors in this for their contributions---even in the large crowd scenes I saw not a single person who seemed not to be appropriately in character to the scene---but ALL of them are worthy commendation. Matthew McConnaghy in his relatively small appearance is fascinating. He, too, is a very polished actor at this stage in his career, and convincing as hell playing a sleazeball broker who advises a young colleague what's important to them.I partially did not want to see this movie because of the greed-driven people on Wall St who perpetrated the largest theft in history and who virtually have seized control of the US Government, not wanting to immerse myself anymore in seeing them in action-----but I was glad I saw it. The debauchery, the sybaritic Caligulan disregard of all morality was eye-opening, even to me, and I thought I was pretty blase at this point about the lifestyles of privileged hedonistic addicts after years of exposure to seeing and reading about these a-holes: but it was edifying. I underestimated their debauchery, really underestimated it.Watch 'The Wolf Of Wall Street.' One hell of a fine movie. One of the best ever.",10,2,11,10 January 2014
