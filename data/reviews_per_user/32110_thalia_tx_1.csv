It," It was good!! Two thumbs up!
","We saw it tonight and it was good!! The story line is different. It does give the audience a better history of the clown. Initially the actors are meh but by the end of the movie you will like them. A few cheesy lines; however, the main characters are kids so I guess its okay! The clown is definitely creeper in this version! Overall its a great movie!",10,4,12,7 September 2017
