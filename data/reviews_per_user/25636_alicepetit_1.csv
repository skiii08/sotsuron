Hereditary," Good, if overrated 6/10
","Great acting, great cinematography but a problem: characters acting in unbelievable ways. Not in a 'don't go into the dark basement alone you dumb horror movie character' way, it's not that type of film, but what these supposed-to-be-believable characters do in their lives. No spoilers, but I'll say 'party' and 'crash' ;)All that said, still a very solid 6/10",6,2,5,9 September 2018
