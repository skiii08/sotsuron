Raiders of the Lost Ark," 'Once again Dr. Jones we see there is nothing you can possess which I can not take away.'
","WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERSWhat a wonderful and fun movie this is.  I saw this movie when I was about seven years old, and since then I've always wanted to be an archaeology. (of course, I realize archaeology is nothing like the movie, but, it's still fun)From the opening scene to in the South American jungle, to the climatic scene in a remote island in the Aegean Sea, this movie is so memorable, awe-inspiring, and filled with wonderment.  It's almost become an enigma of adventure movies, and the funny thing is, it's so simple.  Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is our somewhat sarcastic, free-spirit hero who gets help from an independent spunky woman named Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), and a boisterous, friendly, baritoned-voice Egyptian named Sallah (John Rhys-Davies).  (Whenever I feel happy or I have done something victorious I can't help but break into a few bars of 'Monarch of the Sea,' and 'A British Tar is a Sterling Soul.') Anyway, they fight against a competing French Archaeologist, Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman) and arrogant, Nazi stooge General Herman Dietrich (Wolf Kahler) and the sniveling, impish Nazi thug named Toht (Ronald Lacey) in the quest for the Ark of the Covenant. Denholm Elliot also has a brief role as the intellectual Dr. Marcus Brody, (who became much more prominent in 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.'All the characters are memorable, especially Ronald Lacey's portrayal of Toht.  You can't forget the small balding guy, competely decked out in the all-black uniform, and those glasses perched on the end of his nose, he is great in the bar scene at Nepal.Overall, this movie is just tons of fun, with plenty of action-packed scenes, elaborate sets, and memorable and witty dialouge. I love the Arabian swordsman scene :) I believe it the best of the Indiana Jones trilogy and is definitely a must-see.  And remember: 'Asps.  Very dangerous.  You go first.'",10,0,0,8 August 2000
The Mummy Returns," Mind-numbing
","Mummy Returns is, as expected, way worse than the origional.  It pales in comparison.  And, sadly enough, the first Mummy isn't very good at all!So much to say why this movie didn't work: *SPOILERS AHEAD* 1. The plot is just cluttered with tons of legends, ancient stories, ancient artifacts, bracelets, spears, gods, armies of destruction and other such nonsense. ex. 'They wake up Ahmontep to wake up and kill the Scorpion King who made a pact with so-and-so and got condemmed for ever, so Ahmontep can have his dark army, but he needs the bracelet to wake him up, and some Spear to kill whoever, and who knows how the O'Connells got the spear in the first place.'  All of this confusing stuff is in the first 30 minutes, mind you, and everything plot-wise becomes cloudy and muddled.  The big problem with Mummy Returns, is that it's just not simple enough. 2.  All the heiroglyphics, that everyone can read, say dumb stuff that would nobody would ever bother to carve. 'This way to Scorpion King.'  'He who disturbs this chest (there are numerous chests) will surely die.'  And why would they carve how to kill the Scorpion King (with the sceptre of Osiris) in his own temple?! 3.  The ever-annoying Alex.  He's way to brave and smart for his own good. He's not even cute, and his one-liners are very contrived and not funny. Why doesn't he just write the name of where they are going instead of building sand sculptures?  And where did he get that British accent?  His parents don't talk like that! 4.  The dazzling special-effects that we expect from every movie these days were non-existant.  The airship idea was incredibly stupid, and it didn't look that cool.  The tiny pygmies.  Where did they come from, and what is their purpose?  Who knows.  But they weren't that cool, and had no motivation.  I wasn't scared.  Anubis army, they were okay, but they looked awkward and most of all, fake.  And the graphics of the Scorpion King at the end were extremely laughable.  It looked like something out of a video game. As for the fight scenes, Is it just me or is anyone else sick of seeing slow-motion every time a punch is thrown? 5.  All aspects of the movie have failed, now it's time to see what we came for.  The Rock.  He's actually a pretty good actor.  Oh, wait, he's only in the movie for a few minutes in the beginning.  In spite of this, he graces almost every poster or promotional item for Mummy Returns.  Why didn't they place 'Bad Soldier #3' on the poster?  I mean, he was in the movie just as long!  Another prime example of Hollywood just out to squeeze dollars out of everyone.That concludes my synopsis.  When I see this type of movie I don't expect 'Citizen Kane,' or Shakespeare, but I do expect something a little bit more valuable than this drivel.  Something that shows a worthy effort by the actors and the writing team, by someone who didn't read 'Archaeology for Dummies,' before he started.  Anyways, watch the first Mummy or the perfect example of an action/adventure/comedy movie done right, 'Indiana Jones.' This movie is just another LOUD Hollywood Blockbuster sequel trying to make money off the coat-tails of the semi-popular predecessor.  In that respect, it succeeded marvelously.  Otherwise, it's just another forgettable film where nothing is tangible, nothing is sacred, nothing is genuine, nothing is good.",2,1,2,3 August 2001
The Sixth Sense," Good movie, but a few flaws...
","I believe that this film is very good, but not good enough to be spot #23 on the IMDB top 250 list.  First of all, the movie is a little bit overrated. (which is understandable because no other decent movies were out at the time except for Phantom Menace) Second of all, great movies get better each time you watch them.  With each viewing, Sixth Sense gets less and less exciting and turns almost to the point of boring.  The characters and their problems are not interesting enough to watch again and again.  By the third time you've seen it, the movie becomes mediocre, knowing the ending does not make this movie good. (However, it is fun to point out things you didn't notice before about...well, *you know* (I don't wish to have a spoiler in comment)) Anyway, the problems with the characters is that they are too much the same. They're not melodramatic, but both Willis and (I forget his name) 'the quiet kid' say all their lines in the same kind of serious, low-toned voice. There is feeling behind the lines, but not enough variety of feeling.Finally, there are a few plot holes, but I don't wish to discuss them because previous commenters already have.  Cole 'the quiet kid' did a fine acting job (compared to all the other kid actors out there, he looks like Orson Welles) it wasn't incredibly entertaining to watch his acting skills, but they were good.  I hope the poor kid isn't scarred for life by the tone of the movie, and I hope he doesn't become type-casted and turn into another MacCullay Culkin.Anyway, a good suspenful movie (not really scary) and I would strongly recommend watching the movie once, but not twice, and definately not six times.",6,0,0,11 August 2000
