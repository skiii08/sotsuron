Requiem for a Dream," Depression, obsession and the deep abyss of the human mind
","You're not gonna forget it. It's totally enough to watch it once. It's mutch more effective than a 'horror' movie. It doesn't have jumpscares (maybe one or two) but it is a horror. It shows what happens to a human if his/her inner demons take control on his/her body and mind.
I made a mistake by watching it as a 14 year old because on the day I watched it I was just starring in front of me and I was thinking a out the movie. Don't watch it under 18!",10,0,0,6 January 2019
John Wick," Pretty good
",If you like action movie than it's 100% worth watching. A generic action story but they built up John Wick's legend so well that you're not gonna care about the story that much. Keanu still looks young,7,0,2,2 January 2019
Django Unchained," 'You really want me to shake your hand?'
",One of my favourite westerns. It's so perfect and so Tarantinoish. Incredible actors beautiful camera angles and zooms. I just love it,8,1,3,6 January 2019
Schindler's List," Masterpiece
",It's defenetly a masterpiece and worth watching for everyone who wants to know what happened back then. I watched it two times and I think I'll watch it a few more times because it's so perfect. It's gonna make you cry.,10,1,4,6 January 2019
2001: A Space Odyssey," Unbelievable
",I just can't believe that this movie was made in 1968. It really looks like it was made in outer space. It looks much better than some Sci-fis from the 2000's. Stanley Kubrick's greatest in my opinion.,10,2,5,6 January 2019
Pulp Fiction," Quentin's greatest
","Perfect acting, perfect soundtrack that you can listen all over again without being tired of it.
Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman and Harvey Keitel.
Quentin's greatest movie and that's for sure.",10,0,1,2 January 2019
There Will Be Blood," Best movie of the 21th century!
","1. The casting is perfect, it wouldn't have worked without Daniel Day Lewis.
2. The acting is the best I've ever seen. DDL got his well deserved 2nd Oscar for this.
3. The music is perfect. It reminds me of Kubrick's Space Odyssey, especially in the beginning when the oil first appears. It has a pretty scary appearance just like the monolith in Space Odyssey.
4. The camera movement and the shots are beauty and meaningful too. Not like in today's films.
5. The cuts are just perfect
6. The directing is brilliant.
Thank you for reading. If you haven't seen it, watch it right now. If you have then I hope you agree with me.",10,1,2,11 April 2019
The Green Mile," It's gonna make you cry
",It's the most toutching movie ever made. Everyone's character is believable. Respect for all the actors. I don't remember the music (maybe because I cried throughout the whole movie and that's why I don't remember) but anyways it's defenetly make you cry.,9,1,1,6 January 2019
