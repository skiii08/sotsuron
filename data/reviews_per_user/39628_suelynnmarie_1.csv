Howl's Moving Castle," Wonderfully Imaginative
","I really have enjoyed all of his movies and this was my favorite. Over the past couple years I have seen almost all of his films and am always impressed with them. I really liked how imaginative this one was. His films are always imaginative, but I have never seen a movie push my imagination that far. Plus, I couldn't stop thinking about it for days. I just wanted to know more and more about the world they were in.He truly creates an entire other world that doesn't abide by the rules of what we know. This allowed me to discover them with the girl as she was introduced to a world she hadn't known. I was able to identify with her and Miyazaki sends such a good message with her character. I am a huge fan of this movie and cannot wait to own it.",10,4,6,9 March 2006
