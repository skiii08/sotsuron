Source Code," ponder the fate of Hollywood
","Never have i ever hated a Hollywood movie more.Everything that a movie fan doesn't want EVER in a movie is there.So any1 if Ur wondering 2 watch this..WAIT,its not worth in a Theater,download,so that u can fast forward & delete.if i can vote properly,i would vote -10,or better the movie was never made in the 1st place.i mean,how did i idiots ever make this movie?JG some of us know u really r not an actor,but just some1 who just runs around thinking u act.& MM,u already acted in Eagle Eye,y make yourself go thru the same,but worse movie.& the roles is even more small than what u did in EE.VF,y did u even bother.u could have not acted in any movie,that was worse than this.& the only actor who had a brief but meaningful role(i mean come on,he cried,which is more than the emotions showed by any other actor here) is the bomber Michael Arden.CONGRATULATIONS. DUNCAN JONES,i cant put u here in lowest rated movie.but if i could,this movie would b 250 places below the lowest rated movie.",1,17,32,10 May 2011

","Now this movie's got to be the funniest spoof ever.There's real action mind you,But real good British movies are hard to come by & even hard to find them.But having found this,i have to say,i was surprised & that's good.Very good story,neat characters,some cool action & a lot a attitude.Simon Pegg & Nick Frost are quite good together.Commendable acting by all other characters..Those kids were really good,but,should have been seen more.Those kids were really good,but,should have been seen more.

Paranormal Activity," mockumentary
","First-time director Oren Peli had been afraid of ghosts his entire life, even fearing the movie Ghostbusters, but intended to channel that fear into something positive and productive.[8] Peli took a year to prep his own house for shooting, going so far as to repaint the walls, add furniture, put in a carpet, and build an actual stairwell. A very pleasant side effect, he joked, was ending up with a 'dream home with a big TV'. In this time, he also did extensive research into paranormal phenomena and demonology, stating, 'We wanted to be as truthful as we could be.' The reason for making the ghost in the story a demon was a result of the research pointing to the most malevolent and violent entities being 'demons'. The phenomena in the film takes place largely at night - the vulnerability of being asleep, Peli reasoned, tapped into a human being's most primal fear, stating, 'If something is lurking in your home there's not much you can do about it",8,0,0,23 October 2009
Limitless," New endings
","Seems Hollywood has come with an exceptional new gig..To have an ambiguous ending.Christopher Nolan is a master of this genre.Now Neil Burger has made a movie with a great story,with an excellent ending.Bradley Cooper,seems to have an excellent past few years.All the supporting actors have also done good.Special mention to Robert De Niro,Andrew Howard,Abbie Cornish & Anna Friel.The lead actresses get to experience the way the actor feels,which is also new.Not the usual way to make movies.You're almost sorry they ended on such a note,but also why the movie ended at all.But,makes the viewer finish the movie in his/her own way.Very cool. 9/10.If only for making us guess.",9,1,2,30 May 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," epic
","For all the people who don't like this film,i can only see two reasons, 1)you cant understand English &/or 2)you don't know a good movie when you see one. This movie will be the crowning glory for the trilogy.Lot of emotions are in the movie.All those tributes can be seen in this movie. As a friend of mine said,Michael Bay isn't known for making movies with an actual story.Only,guns,explosions,two people fighting themselves or others with a drop dead gorgeous actress.Even though Rosie-Huntington doesn't do much in the film(lie),she does better job than Fox.All other characters are in place. For all those people who thought The Dark Knight was the last REAL action movie they say,this will be the second. Congratulations to everyone who made this film.",9,3,8,29 June 2011
