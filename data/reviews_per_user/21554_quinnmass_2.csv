The Blair Witch Project," excruciatingly stupid people
","To entertain myself (it had to come from somewhere) I rooted for (1) the characters to die and (2) anyone involved in adding to the hype of this movie to die, in as painful a way as can be conceptualized.I want to point out one thing that particularly bothered me about this movie.  It is October in Maryland.  Thus at this time of year the dark lasts slightly longer than the light.  Yet, at some point in the afternoon while it's still light, they sit down to bicker with one another, drained from having walked '16 hours' since that morning's camp.  What sloppiness. Moreover, these idiots used no cleverness whatsoever in trying to figure their way out of the forest.  I just looked at their deaths as an excellent opportunity to thin the gene pool.",Null,0,1,4 August 2001
Remember the Titans," Trite pablum
","Maybe this movie suffers because I saw it such close proximity to genuinely good movies (Traffic, Shawshank and Ordinary People).  And I am sure that if I was ten or eleven it would have been good to watch.  But the truth is this movie has problems, lots of them.It is 'based on a true story.'  After seeing the movie, I can believe the following is true: (1) Alexandria, VA exists; (2) the high school there has a football team; (3) in 1971 it won a bunch of games; (4) the coach was newly hired, and black; (5) some people didn't like it, and it took some getting used to; (6) 1971 was a time, in general, in America, where racial integration was a source of bitter contention in many places; (7) Alexandria probably had some unease with the transition.  Everything else about this movie has to be manufactured by Disney.  I think the low point for me was when Gary's girlfriend runs on the field to shake Junior's hand before the game.  See, previously she was one of the people unwilling to accept blacks into the school.  But now she's learned (somewhere off-screen) that she was wrong.  (1) She recognizes it; (2) she has enough poise as a high schooler to admit her beliefs were ill-founded; (3) she picks a dramatic/extremely inappropriate moment to acknowledge her change.  What poignancy!  Gee, we learned a lot about ourselves.  There were so many 'movie conventions,' flat, stereotypical characters and cliches in this movie that I felt cheated.  The good characters learn something about themselves and change and grow, the bad characters are called out by the good characters - we don't know much about the bad characters, just that they're bad - and they are put in their place.  The good guys win, the bad guys lose.  Minds are changed.  People grow.  A soundtrack plays.Also, remember Jerry Maguire?  That kid was cute, audiences love that. Let's put one of those in our movie.  We'll give her lots of lines, and we'll be constantly reminded how unusual she is - most little girls don't know football in depth, but she does!! - and hence, comedy.Every time I tried to like this movie (and I went in hoping to like it) it spat out packaged non-reality that jarred me into deep irritation.  This is not the worst movie of all time, but I felt patronized being asked by its producers to follow along.  2 out of 10.",Null,0,0,23 July 2001
