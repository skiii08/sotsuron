The Blair Witch Project," A good creepy little chiller
","Notice i said CHILLER, 'cause this movie or docu-horror pic, leaves chills down your spine long after the movie is done. It is well done and original. You actually FEEL what the characters are feeling, and also it helps that at the fact the actors in here are obviously not well known. That even helps the audience identify with the characters. I also think that most of the dialogue leading up to 2nd day in the woods, was actually good. Some others didn't think so, or at least focused more on thre profanity, which was used quite frequently LATER on in the film.However I must say, it scares you more in the mind, but any visual scares acre more chilling than terorizing, especially for the 'main-stream' audience. Actually the 'main-stream' audience would probably be dissapointed at not only the fact it operates at a low budget, but also that it is filmed in documentary style, and has alot running and screaming at things that you can't even see. Besides that I think it was a well made movie, which u could feel the terror the characters went through as they search for the Blair Witch. Its scares might even fall short for one or two scenes(which i won't explain)cause i and my sister who i took with me, found ourselves laughing. But it quickly got creepy toward the end, and the end will leave u either disapointed, wanting more, or it will stay with u for days. Good Filmaking I'll give it *** stars out of ****",7,0,1,5 August 1999
Blade," good entertainment
","That's basically what i have to say to sum it up. It's good entertainment.Y? Well first off the action sequences, actually done in full by martial arts expert Wesely Snipes, were really cool. Second would be the good direction by Norrington, in the way he does the action scenes and puts some good atmosphere into it, which of the likes I haven't seen in a while. Another reason is basically that Iam sucker for these type of movies, and I love them.  At first when I saw this film, I thought it was good and all, but Wesely Snipes character seemed a bit silly or monotone. But, it wasn't until I was told that I would have to look at it from the perspective as a comicbook adaptation. Then after viewing it again, I saw Snipes character as a cool, and even at a times hilarious dude(in a comic book way).
Over all, I give it *** out of **** because of the great action sequences, and great production design which incorporates in the atmosphere, especially at the end.",Null,0,1,17 February 2000
L.A. Confidential," Great
","This is one of those few fims, which gets everything right. It's a crime drama, based on some Mc Elroy Novel, about what really went on in LA in the 50s. There were corrupt cops, call-girls done up to look like celebrities, and all kinds of stuff. Welll written, well acted with among the best actors around: Kevin Spacey, Russel Crowe, King Basinger, Guy Peirce, James Cromwell. (minus Morgan Freeman, Denzel Washington, Robert Deniro, etc.) The shoot scene at the end was pretty good. However my only problem was with the way the black criminals were portrayed; ex. one guy acts so scared from being interrogated its shameful.  Anyway overall this is ***1/2 out of four.",9,1,2,12 April 2001
The Terminator," Classic scifi/action movie
","This is truly one of those groundbreaking sci-fi/action films, which leaves u breathless at the end. It is suspenseful, has good acting, good effects, mainly the Terminator effects and makeup, and more importantly, it started off a good carreer for Cameron. Theres not much else to be said, its got it all, except for sentimentality, but REALLY, after u watch this film, you will know why there isn't any.",9,0,0,16 March 2000
Total Recall," Awesome!
","This movie was awesome stuff man! I really liked the special effects, makeup and action. All of it was a good mix. Oh and also humor. You need humor in these types of films or else u get ugly films with unsympathetic characters in a film that takes itself too seriously. This however isnt one of those. It's just good entertainment. Some of Arnold's one-liners he spoke well. One scene ie: Some mutant Arnold's Quaid character runs into: You have alot of guts showing your face around here. Arnold's Quaid: Look who's talking. I think that line is SO hilarious. I laugh at it every time and often quote it to friends. You see he is talking to some scarred-faced-loookin mutant about his looks.Over all this movie rocked. But unlike what others say about his film carreer declining after this one, I dont think so. Ok so True Lies had its faults, but very few movies don't. The acton scenes and humor made up for a slow and somewhat odd middle. Even though some may disagree with what I am about to say, The first The Terminator may have even had its faults in there. Even though it was a classic to be sure, the budget sort of gave it slightly less potential then it could have had, but it still rocked despite this. Eraser was actually pretty good not as good as Total Recal or Terminator, but it was beter than Commando. Twins was probably his best try at a comedic role/film. Last action hero pretty much was bad but it still wasn't bottom of the barrel. It actually had potential. Batman&Robin may very well has been his worst. I haven't seen the 6th Day so...I'll see it on video, no big deal.Total Recall was and still is a good film to watch for pure entertainment value, with some nice sci-fi elements peppered in there.",9,0,1,28 February 2001
Scream," Entertaining, but not THAT scary
","Scream is a good entertaining horror flick. It has twists and turns through out especially toward the end! Its about a stalker/killer dressed up in a dark costume with a ghost mask and right from the beginning starts slaughtering teens. The direction by Wes Craven is good, and the script by Williamson matches it in this witty slasher. But, it wasn't really all that scary as soo many people seem to say, I think it had a couple of shocks here and there, but the scares toward the end take a back seat to the stylishness of the references found through out the film. And the cast, the cast is alright, but nuthin too special unless u compare them to the 80s horror films (except to a few like Nightmare on Elmstreet,  first Friday the 13th, and Child's Play). But they do try, and i'll give them that. Over all the movie is really fun to watch and if your into horror and yet want something different and refreshing, watch this!",7,0,0,4 August 1999
Halloween," Halloween: The night he came homE
","This movie is one of the best horror flms out there. Next to Psycho, this is the best psychological slasher. Every one after was just corny, badly acted, TOO gory, and/or wasn't even scary, with the exception of a couple of Friday the 13th films(at least they had scary eerie moments, but the terrible acting and non-plots were still apparent.) But Halloween paved the way for todays supposedly horror films.Actually I must say that being 18, i DID like Scream, but Halloween keeps its throne as the most scary, erie, chilling REAL horror film ever made! Watching this and then watching Scream, u can see the similarities and differences of the two. However more differences, which could be good or bad. Scream doesn't know how to chill you or scare you like Halloween. But what made scream good was the fact that it knows the genre and therefore knows how to satirize it and still remain entertaining. Halloween, on the other hand, is almost pure terror, erieness, and it SCARES you, thanks to a solid direction under Carpenter and production under Debrah Hill and Moustafa Akkad, and the music by Carpentar also helps a WHOLE LOT. Oh, and don't forget Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasnce performances, which are really good. All those elements  make Halloween good, scary fun all the way.Memorable scene : A couple of boys trick or treating, dare each other to go inside the Myers house. The audience is thinking 'oh on, the poor boys are going to get it' Then all of a sudden, Pleasance speaks at them from behind the bushes, and scares the boys s***less.That scene was hilarious.        ;)",Null,0,1,9 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," A good, superbly acted thriller
","The Sixth Sense is a good thriller. It is superbly acted by Osmen, and Willus(in a different role) is good as the psychologist who tries to help the child. But Osmen is really good as the disturbed boy. I think he's probably the best young young actor to come along sinse Miko Hughes in Wes Craven's New Nightmare. But Osmen's performance was probably more realistic than Hughes'(but both of them make that kid in S.W. Episode 1, look pretty dull).This film, being shot in philadelphia(my home town of course:-) was beautifully shot. It was kind of funny when in the beginning of the film, when it mentions an exact part of the city, and it looked quite different than what most philadelphians are used to(my dad knew it though). It was neat trying to find out and recognizing the places the film took place in and around.Anyway It is a good film, some slow spots, but its taught, well acted, and has some nice shocks toward the end.Oh and to the guy who said that 'people  who are easily entertained' will like this film. But, actually my dad wasn't fully satisfied and believe me he IS easily entertained. He thought by the trailers, it would be something different, so did i, i guess. However i LIKED the film, he thought it was just OK. My dads rating **1/2, mine ***  out of **** stars.",Null,0,0,8 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Now my fav. of the trilogy and maybe of all
","When I first saw this movie as youngster, I thought it was good, but i was into the Action Packed Star Wars and Return of the Jedi better, but now i have a different outlook of it. Now it my fav of the series and probably of all movies. It has deep meaning to it. The scenes with the all-knowing Yoda and Luke. There also were some good action sequences on Hoth, the Icy planet. But the duel between Vader and Skywalker is one of the best sword fights EVER! If there is anyone out there who is reading this and hasn't seen this movie or Starwars, then see them all NOW. As a matter of fact, u can probably bye them for a cheap price as a set at your local Best Buy or where ever.",10,0,0,4 August 1999
