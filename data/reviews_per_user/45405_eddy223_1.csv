Sucker Punch," Beautiful story
","This review might have a few spoilers!! This movie is beautiful! I noticed many reviews from PROFESSIONALS gave it really low score, saying the movie had no story and relied on amazing visuals to satisfy viewers. But this is entirely untrue. I wonder where these professional reviewers come from... if they cant even think hard enough and put the effort into understanding the deep meaning of the movie. This movie has kind of an Inception feel to it, where there's a dream within a dream. Whats actually going on is Babydoll and the other girls are in an insane asylum, and they get sexually abused by the wardens. The Doctor, i forgot her name, but shes the one who is the 'dance teacher' in the burlesque dream, teaches the girls how to put themselves in happy thought to help them recover. This results in Babydoll aways imagining Action sequences when bad things happen. so, The burlesque world is an imagining of a better world because the asylum is horrible to her, and the action packed worlds are all when her and the girls are sexually abused, and instead of remembering and thinking about being sexually abused, she puts herself into that action world by 'dancing (getting molested)' and ignoring her real surrounding and putting herself somewhere else. the movie is truly beautiful, The new york times and all those other newspapers and magazines really should consider looking for someone else to start reviewing movies.",10,5,9,13 May 2011
