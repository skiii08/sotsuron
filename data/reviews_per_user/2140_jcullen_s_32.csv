Catch Me If You Can," Catch me if you can
",This is way better then I was expecting just a nice Steven Spielberg movie I would forget the next day then I forgot the incredible power of Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio and this also being a true story is just incredible I don't think I was ever bored watching this movie it's a huge cat and mouse game and the mouse is a genius this is a high recommend I think a lot of people can get something out of this movie,10,0,1,3 February 2020
It," IT
",Thus was a big surprise in 2017 cause everyone thought it was gonna be bad and it was pretty good especially for a Stephen King movie witch are hit or miss but mostly miss I have read the book and watched the mini series and I can say they will mess up IT chapter 2 witch I really don't want to happen,8,0,1,5 August 2019
Hereditary," Hereditary
",My favourite movie of 2018 was a very disturbing one that was filled with sharp turns and twists filled with horrifying scenes incredible acting pagan cults and really great directing there's not that much I can say about this movie just don't go into it with a full stomach this is not your average horror movie I don't need to say that you should watch it you might regret it it's very unsettling,10,2,2,27 April 2020
John Wick," John wick
",I heard this was one of the best action movies of the decade but I was still a bit skeptical at first because how action movies have been heading down far but it does not let down the action scenes were buetiful and I really liked their originality of it and of course you have Keanu Reeves not mad max fury road good but still shows how we can still make a good R rated action movie that doesn't have superhero's,8,0,2,24 April 2020
Rocketman," FANTASY is an understatement
",Rocketman is the best movie I've seen this year unless once upon a time in Hollywood can beat it it will stay at the top as it isTaron Edgerton was good in kingsman but in this you really get to see his acting shine I don't know a lot of these things are true or not but the tagline is a true fantasy or Elton John really did launch up in the sky In his dodgers uniform and explode another good thing about the movie it doesn't hold back it's 14a and I like it that way it's what bohemian rhapsody should have been with its PG rating only big problems are that the movie is a bit slow at times and some scenes go on for to long other then that great This is definitely worth your money even if your not the biggest Elton John fan and a amazing musical,8,5,9,2 June 2019
Citizen Kane," Citizen Kane
",You just need to lower your expectations and think it's just a boring movie about politics and newspapers and you'll be all set because this is way better then you think it is when people say The directing is ahead of its time there not doing it any justice this is one of the best directed movies I've ever seen and the character Charles Foster Kane himself is a charming cool guy and brilliantly played by Oreson Wells he is 100% genius,10,1,1,20 October 2019
Us," I am disappointed
",Get out was one of my favourite movies of 2017 so of course I was hyped for Us I was ready for a great thrilling experience but I was ended up disappointed the only parts I found scary was Red and her voice and that scene where there underground moving weird and eating bunnies only someone who has watched Us will hopefully understand what I'm saying other then that it wasn't scaryAnother thing was the actors other then the female lead that I always forget the name of she was amazing other then that the rest are serviceable and bad the little girl was horrible playing her evil counterpart and the dad was even worse with his screaming all the characters are unlikeable and bad other thn the female lead and her counterpartIf you didn't like how Jordan Peele lightly used comedy in Get out that ruined the tension in a scene you will hate UsThere are quite a lot of things I like though the idea and concept is great the themes are great the female lead is amazing the writing and screenplay is good not as good as Get out but good and the switcharo twist at the end blew my mind,6,2,3,8 May 2019
Knives Out," Knives out
",Definitely better then I thought it was gonna be even though it was praised a lot when it came out but even for a who done it movie that have been done to death and are pretty predictable this one is pretty original and it makes you feel kind of stupid when you don't see the twists and turns it was also pretty funny and people are now seeing that Rian Johnson is a good person and Won't be seen is last Jedi guy this was it my favourite movie of 2019 but still pretty good and enjoyable but my only big problem is if this is a movie you would be able to watch repededly it's kind of a that was really good watch once movie over time MABYE that will change still pretty good movie directing was pretty sweet actors were pretty sweet ending with that last shot makes you feel so good about how they got what they deserved strong recommendation,9,0,5,13 June 2020
The Irishman," The Irishman
",The Irishman is as if December 2 my favourite movie of 2019 it's way more inteaining then I thought it was gonna be I thought it was just gonna be goodfellas with old people but it's way more then that I could say it's probably better then good fellas it was way more emotional then good fellas i really felt for Robert DeNiros character Frank and the incredible life he was in and all the crazy stuff he was involved in like TheKennedy assassination or the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa of course Martin Scorsese is a great director overall great watch do not let the runtime scare you it's very intertaining high recommendation best Netflix movie,10,7,13,3 December 2019
The Great Dictator," The Great dictator!
",This is the second best comedy movie about hitler with that new Jo Jo rabbit movie coming out soon I think is gonna be better this is pretty entertaining I really enjoy watching Chaplin and Buster Keaton even though it's not laugh out loud funny there really fun to watch and it's pretty cool Hitler actually watched this movie he obviously diddint like it but it's pretty amazing that Chaplin had the balls to make this movie and it's hilarious how great of a German accent he has in the film,10,1,1,8 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Not let the reviews tell you otherwise
","First I wanna say I already have the thing checked for spoilers but just saying I'm covering a lot of ground of the movie you have been warnedLet's get all the big problems out of the way the very beginning of the movie wasn't good and it was rushed ''Oh palpatine had this plan from the beginning'' talking about how he had this all planned out since episode 6 and stuff I believe this is more Rian Johnson's fault(writer and director of episode 8) because JJ Abrams had a plan and he to struggle to bring back his plan another
Big problem I had is Flinn kinda forgets about
Rose and goes to fall In love with that other exiled
stormtrooper they meet on that uncharted planet other then that I thought the movie was really good Carrie fisher how they used her deleted scenes were great and they did the best they could with her the action scenes were amazing and I loved them and let's not forget about Harrison Ford that scene was very emotional and people were crying in the theatre palpatine was really menacing and he looked horrifying I was a bit iffy on Ray being her grandfather i would have préfères Obi Wan but after watching it the movie it makes more science for the plot let's not forget about the Ewoks at the end witch were 100% for George Lucas you also get to see some familiar old faces I really hope this movie gets higher then what last Jedi has on IMDB because this is a really good movie overall high recommendation give this movie the support it deserves",7,0,2,20 December 2019
Romeo + Juliet," Romeo and Juillet
",I don't get why people hate on this movie and take it to seriously people need to understand that the play itself is a tragedy but us filled with so much stupid stuff I think the director who forgot to IMDB his name is a genius for adapting this so well if he tried to make it serious I wouldn't think it would be that good and be a bit boring I feel like when I studied the play in school there where so much problems with it screenplay wise that If it was realesed now it would be torn to shreds I fell like this director got it by making something so boring so entertaining some of my only problems were actually probably on purpose like with all the fast cutting and such and the wired sound effects but I think this is just the director being cheesey and making nice little cute action scenes and it makes it even better that it's in modern times and there talking like it's the 16th century don't take this movie serious it's great,10,1,1,18 March 2020
Fargo," Fargo
",To start off the Cohen brothers genius they did silt you can't get away with now they made people believe in this crazy story and said it was based off a true story because we can do a easy google search to prove if it's write or wrong The screenplay was also fantastic but I knew about the whole wood chipper scene but it was still brutal but it would have been way better if I knew all the acting I'd good especially from Buchemmi who I thought was just gonna be how he is in his Sandler movies anyway this is a high recommendation Goff job Joel and Eathan,9,0,0,28 February 2020
Bohemian Rhapsody," Very overrated
",This movie is kinda overrated and made a really huge toxic fanbase with people who say they are huge queen fans really only know them from this movie the only thing I super liked was Rami Malek a terrific actor in my opinion but the movie does have a lot of inaccuracies and they bug me just a bit,6,4,8,30 June 2019
Hot Rod," Hot Rod
",If you like Andy Samburg from stuff like Saturday Night Live and from being In Lonkey island you're most likely gonna like this movie it could have been funnier if it was rated higher but for a PG comedy it was pretty funny I recommend this as a pretty solid late night comedy to watch with friends or if you're just bored,8,0,0,24 November 2019
The Shining," Shining
","Now people may disagree but this is my favourite horror movie because it was made in 1980 and it was still able to spook me out then most movies made in this modern age with some exceptions like Heretitary for people who have watched the movie I'll give you a hint LADY, ROOM 237, BATHROOMSomething also great about this movie is Danny Lloyd(sorry if it's not actors name) who plays Danny Torrence in the movie is a pretty good child actor and he didn't even know he was in a horror movie witch makes it even better from how much children fail to do okay nowadays but the acting from Shelly duvaulle is good to and I think gets a little hate the crown jewel is Jack NicholsonBut something that makes this movie better is the fan base behind it thinking the movie is about the Holocaust or the genocide of the native Americans witch is pretty crazyThis is a good watch for something to watch if your bingeing horror movies or if you just wanna watch one in general but if a theatre near you has the movie replaying for a special event I highly recommend going",10,0,1,8 September 2019
Yesterday," 5.5 at best
",I myself am a Beatles fan and was pretty hyped for this movie and was sadly disappointed with the end result the very beginning was bad with a pretty funny and solid second act then at the end it just got bad again some characters do nothing and serve no purpose like lily James character was annoying so was that guy named rocky and the two friends of James Malik and lily James were pointless parts in the story were pretty unneeded like Ed Sheehan although the singing was pretty good,5,2,7,30 June 2019
Toy Story 4," Toy story 4
",A bit of a lit down to an extent kinda disappointed me at the end but first let's get through the good stuff the animation was incredible really had a huge ton of effort put into it there was so much detail it's insane the pacing was also pretty good there was always something interesting going on and I was never bored the antagonist doll I thought had a lot of charrecter and I really liked her she was pretty original I also liked the whole plot of Bonnie being scared to start school so she makes a toy out of garbage who wants to kill himself all the time and it impresses me that Disney made Forky toys... people are buying literally garbage for there children I dunno I just think that's just funny alright time for some bad stuff so I liked the whole plot of it I just don't like how they converted Forky so fast from wanting to kill himself to being all happy and it was kind of annoying but the biggest problem of all was that ending a lot of people liked it but I thought it was just stupid why would Woody do this to me also watching toy story 3 there is only one mention of her in the beginning that she was gone who actually noticed she was gone before seeing the trailer for this movie also there was like no Buzz what's up with that those are most of my problems overall it was okay worst in series though oh and Keanu as Duke Kaboom was stellar I would probably suggest to watch this if you like the rest of the series the majority seem to like the ending more then me,6,0,0,18 March 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A BLAST!
",This movie is meant to be watched In theatres it's s 3 hours and I wasn't bored a bit the twist at the end was a great change of history and I cried when Bruce got chucked at a car this was the best time I've had all year especially after seeing Godzilla KOTM and yesterday witch sucked,10,41,70,4 August 2019
Aladdin," Meh
",A huge majority of actors and actresses are not really that good in this movie the really only thing I liked was Will Smith as the genie witch I didn't think he was gonna pull off the production design is really bad I know this is a remake of an animated movie but I'm gonna complainI was also not the biggest Aladin fan as a kid I was more into Toy story and the lion king but Robbin Williams as the genie was my favourite part and Will smith as the genie is my favourite for the live actionWhen you see this god awful CGI it will bug you for a bit but you just adjust to the badness it was also stretched and boring like endgame it should be 30 minutes less longerAnother thing I really hated was the guy who played Jafar he was not a good actor so was the guy who played Aladin when Jafar bans him to the ends of the world at the near end of the movie and Aladin screams NOOOOOO! It was very cringe filled and bad,3,41,74,25 May 2019
1917," 1917 review
",Alright now this was a good movie but there are definitely some problems with it but we'll start with the good stuff obviously the directing was amazing by mr.sam Mendes I really enjoyed the concept of pretty much a 1 take film even though it's like 5 takes and I liked how they ended them like when the guy falls down the stairs the take ends then he wakes up to s firey blitz this movie had a whole lot of effort put into it to with all the action scenes alright the bad stuff this movie was pretty much only getting people to see it for the whole one take thing the story was not really the most investing of things near the end it feels a bit rushed to I didint like how his friend died so early it surprised me or they could of had some more bonding and chemistry for us to really know the characters before his offs one off because I was really enjoying their scenes together overall a good movie but im happy it didint get best picture at Oscars I would say good recommendation definitely should of seen it in theatres when it was out or I hope you have a good TV,7,0,1,3 April 2020
Midsommar," Midsommar
",Probably not my favourite movie of 2019 there were a lot of bangers this year like parasite and the lighthouse but this is definitely way more disturbing then the lighthouse and I'd have to think about hereditary this deeply unsettled me and I would hope you think twice about watching this because once you see it you can't unseen it and it's not just one scene that's like this is the worst one just pretty much the last half of thus 150 minute movie is brutal I would have to question your sanity after watching this and Ari Asters who is a terrific director,10,3,11,27 April 2020
Titanic," Titanic
",This movie is extremely better then I expected it to be I thought it was just gonna be a stupid romantic movie with stupid characters but it's way more then that from how good James Cameron can make a female character and DiCaprio is also really good in this Jack and Rose have a really good chemistry then I was expecting and in the climax doesint hold back with a lot more shown deaths witch I wouldn't expect a lot of from James Cameron we also see when there going back to get survivors we see dead children a stuff and it's pretty disturbing I recommend this highly I had low expectations don't let the runtime scare you,10,6,7,11 December 2019
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," Rock on Jack Black
",This movie proves that you can still be a killer metal band while only having an acoustic gutair and this movie is funnier then I thought it was gonna be just wait til you get to the laser scene and the end is one of the best things I've ever seen how much movies do you know that Dave Grohl from Nirvana/Foo fighters is the devil,8,0,0,28 September 2019
Joker," Joker
",Major spoilers aheadYou've been warnedSo this is probably the best movie I've seen the whole year let's start off with Phoenix who brilliantly played Joker in his own way and is really good at playing a crazy person and that laugh that he had was great overall he was a really good Joker had a whole different look and everything the story overall was thrilling and full of twists and turns and suprises and makes you question your sanity to what's real and not to and has a good decent amount of stuff to be a R rated movie like how he stabbed somebody with scissors or when he shot Robert de Niro in the face overall the movie was well acted written and surprisingly well directed for somebody who directs movies like the Hangover I could go as far as to say Joaquins Joker is on par with Heath Ledger and just on par with the Dark Knight overall this movie is a high recommend to any moviegoers and hell of one to watch,8,2,7,20 October 2019
The Wolf of Wall Street," Wolf of wall street
",Wolf of wall street is probably the most underated Martin Scorsese movie it feels very different then the rest of his other stuff it has a really good sense of humour Leonardo DiCaprio Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie are excellent in the movie it's directed really well the whole look of it is good it's Martin Scorsese so it's a true story I can't recommend this enough it's thrilling and fantastic,10,1,4,4 December 2019
It Chapter Two," Better then original TV movie
",I enjoyed the movie I thought it was scary at times well get to that later and an overall pretty good adaptationBut I feel very mixed with problems like I never was interested with the Ben Beverly and Bill triangle and that's another thing Ben was really different in this movie in the book and original movie I remember him as a drunk playboy millionaire something like Tony Stark he reminded me of but now he just looks like a bodybuilder or model or something like that and it bugs meI do really like the rest of the characters like Richie and Mike have been my favourite because Richie is amazingly played by Finn wolfhard(sorry if spelled wrong) and Bill Hader is just great and Mike I really loved because he's so emotionally broken from It for 27 years because he has never forgot about It people might disagree with me about Mikes character but I like himThe directing was another great part about this movie with all the transitions and things like that and this is way scarier then It 2017 because we got stuff like a wired bug with a baby face come out of a fortune cookie and that unforgettable Ms.Kersh scene witch is on par with the shinning but there were a bit to many jump scares if you ask meSomething I didn't like was the new Henery Bowers the kid I thought was good but the older him was just over the top and just boring to watch in my opinionI do like the Steven king cameo that was pretty intertaning and how they always say to bill his endings suck witch is a lot of things people say about King great book bad ending another problem I had is while it was funny it was a bit to much at times for example the Chinese place was good to be funny but not when Eddie gets thrown up on and they play it comicalOverall a good movie my thoughts might change but right now It chapter 2 is a 7 for me,7,0,5,7 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Best prequel
",Phantom menace was bad and attack of the clones was god awful but revenge of the sixth is a pretty good and solid movie this is what we wanted the whole prequels to be and Hayden Christiansen does a pretty good job of acting it really only has some small problems like the Vader NOOOO other then that nice fun Star Wars movie,8,26,31,5 May 2019
The Lion King," Lion king
","This is mine personally my favourite Disney movie excluding Pixar for a couple of reasons to start off with I grew up with because most Disney movies if I didn't see as a kid but as an adult I probably wouldn't like them but when you rematch the ones you watched as a kid it's still good if that makes any sense for example I love Beauty and the beast and lion king because I watched them as a child but I never watched Little mermaid or Aladin as a kid(don't get mad at me) but I didn't like them as much because I diddint grow up with themThis also has the best music out of all of them I can name Hakunah Matatah, Be prepared, circle of life, Can you feel the love tonight, and Can't wait to be king off of my head cause they were great and co written by Elton John and that's part of why it was so memerable in short Lion king is great to rewatch older and good to watch with your kids",10,1,1,8 September 2019
Marriage Story," Marriage story
",I went in with I expectations for this movie as it has been highly praised by people from movie critics to everybody and even though it was a good movie there are some problems I had the acting was superb and excellent the directing was good I enjoyed the movie a lot.... now the bad stuff the music was awful and I didn't like it the music took me out of the movie it was composed by Randy Newman that's probably why it sounds like a Pixar movie some scenes were a bit corny and I diddint like because they were pointless and unnecessary but overall a great film didint expect this to be my thing but I liked it recommend this film a bit overrated but enjoyable,8,3,6,10 January 2020
Raging Bull," Raging Bull
",This movie is so much more then I expected it to be I thought it was gonna be like rocky or somthi Along the lines of that but it's so much more and so much deeper I was going into it confused because it didint look like a Martin Scorsese movie but now watching it I really liked it the boxing scenes weRe incredabile and the directing was well Martin Scorsese Robert DeNieo does my favourite performance I think I've ever seen by him this is a high recommendation go see this,10,2,2,14 January 2020
John Wick: Chapter 2," Chapter 2
",The second in the series is pretty good but I would say nog as good as the first the first has more originality and this one has far superior action there still realitivally around the same they both have pretty weak main antagonist the in the second one it's a bit pacey in the middle overall still a good watch I enjoyed it good recommendation if you wanna non superhero action movie from last decade,7,1,1,27 April 2020
