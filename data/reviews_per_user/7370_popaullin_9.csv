The Avengers," A perfect blockbuster-nothing else.
","This film succeeds on many levels,the perfect use of CGI,the fair use of characters(superheroes)introduced in previous films,the fun and quirky tone,the quick pacing,great action and humor,all these traits build up to make The Avengers one of the best,decade-defining blockbusters.And thaaaaaat's all.It doesn't try anything particularly bold,like getting an R rating,mixing other genres,or asking questions that aren't superficial or simple.Sooooo...7/10.",7,0,0,9 May 2020
Captain Marvel," This is not a bad movie.It's mediocre.
","First of all,Brie Larson's was not bad.And second,the 'political' views or 'white men hating' are not the problem.THE PROBLEM is...you've seen this movie before.Many times.The script is...to describe it...simple and disjointed.Captain Marvel doesn't feel emotionally deep,besides from that,everything is OKAY.NOT BAD.It just won't be in the best Marvel movie ever(nor best female-lead superhero movie.That goes to Wonder Woman)(for now.)",6,1,2,27 February 2020
Captain Marvel," This is not a bad movie.
","Now,this is not a thoughtful,nor deep movie.You see this movie for a comedy with some action.To sum it up,this is a buddy cop movie.It is designed to be one.So,if you want a good time(or 90s nolstalgia),watch this.It is funny and enjoyable.",6,1,2,21 February 2020
Captain Marvel," This is not a bad movie.
","A lot of people don't like it .Okay,I get it.The main protagonist's powers are just a cheap plot device,the character doesn't have a good development(the movie can be split into two parts-no powers and powers),the action is cheesy,but that is not the point of the movie.Captain Marvel is a 90s buddy cop comedy!The villains aren't supposed to be another Thanos,they're just Hollywood villains.So,if you want to watch something serious,don't watch this.Watch this when your asking for entertainment.",6,1,2,21 February 2020
Interstellar," A modern classic.
","This is one of the best sci-fi movies ever.
The visuals in this films are breathtaking,epic and emotional,and with the epic soundtrack,they create an atmosphere that sucks you in like a black hole,and doesn't let you go until the end.
The characters are also well created,and the actors portraying them are at the top of their game here.Every scene is not wasted,and the emotions feel so raw that you can experience them yourself.
The plot is very interesting,with the help of Kip Thorne(the scientist that helped Nolan),makes the plot even more better.
The whole story is all about humanity,tenacity,and hope. It is a visually impressing film with deep messages and great acting.Nolan has done it again.",10,0,2,24 February 2020
Avengers: Endgame," An flawed popcorn masterpiece.
","This is an epic,or,an war epic.It probably one of the most epic films ever made.It is not perfect,but still one of the best movies ever.
Just as every marvel(the good ones) movie,it borrows a special genre.In this case,the war epic.It is magnificent to watch,with one of the best CGI effects people have ever seen.So,the flaw isn't the visuals.The character developments have been established by earlier films,and this film only deepens them.So,the characters aren't the problem,either.The biggest problem of this film is the plot.
The more convoluted a plot gets,the more frequently a plot hole appears.This film juggles a lot of plots,so naturally,a few plot holes appears.
Fortunately,this doesn't change the fact that this was a visual masterpiece.Unfortunately ,this sets up a high standard for cinematic universe finales.And the DCU.Let's just wish some film will achieve such greatness in the near future.",8,0,5,21 February 2020
The Dark Knight," Masterpiece
","This is one of the best and influenced superhero films out there.In fact,it defined the early DCU movie styles.(not a good thing)
This film is fulled with top-notch acting (especially Heath Ledger),great action scenes(and more interesting),and dark moral questions.
The joker represents terrorism,and the whole movie surrounds a question-how easy is it to influence people.The whole revolves around ethical questions.Joker is trying to proof his his idea that Gotham is rotten.Not only the villains,but the citizens,too.The point is,he wins.The both sides of the ship didn't blow each other up isn't because they're good,it is the sheer pressure the person who blows up the other ship will face.",10,0,2,21 February 2020
Super 8," nolstalgic and fun,but highly unoriginal.
","This film is pretty good in several aspects:the story good,the acting is good,the whole homage to the 80s is also good.
But......it's too unoriginal.You've seen the twists,you know the direction of the movie,and it isn't jam-packed with enough 80s refrences to cash in solely on the nolstalgic.
Overall,this film is a enjoyable film without anything innovative.",8,0,0,23 March 2020
Parasite," A short review of Parasite.
","To be short,this is a greatly directed,perfectly shot masterpiece with well-crafted characters that strike a balance between nastiness and sympathetic,and can be interpreted both ways;pitch dark humor that is both ironic and clever and fits the main theme,which perfectly blends horror with a satirical tone.",10,1,3,21 March 2020
