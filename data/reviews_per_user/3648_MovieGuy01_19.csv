Angels & Demons," Excellent Movie...
","I watched Angels & Demons for the first time last night, and i found the film to be excellent. It starts off with the Roman Catholic Church mourning the death of Pope Pius XVI in Rome. Vatican City prepares for who will be the next Pope Until that time, Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, a papal court official and former helicopter pilot, takes temporary control of the Vatican. Reporters, nuns, priests, and other members of the Church crowd into Saint Peter's Square, waiting for the white smoke from the conclave, which signal who has been selected as the next pope. But the Illuminati, a 400-year old, underground secret society, kidnap the four most likely candidates before the conclave begins The Illuminati threaten to kill one every hour, starting at 8:00 pm, and then destroy the Vatican in a burst of light at midnight. I found the scenery to be amazing especially around Saint Peter's Square, I do not see why people do not like this film.",8,1,2,4 October 2009
Dawn of the Dead," Good zombie horror movie....
",I thought that Dawn Of The Dead was a good horror film. It is about a young nurse named Ana who is returning from a hard day at work. wanting to go home and see her husband Louis. But not paying attention to an emergency broadcast telling the public about a deadly plague of flesh eating creatures. Until the next day when the next door neighbour a little girl comes into their house and bites Ana's husband Louis in the neck. But Louis does not stay dead. later he is up and trying to bite his wife Ana. Ana manages to escape in her car and sees members of the public being eaten by flesh eating zombies. She crashes into a tree. she is recovered by a black police officer called Kenneth. They group up with 3 more people and find shelter in a shopping mall called the Crossroads Mall. While they are in the mall they find 3 security guards there armed with guns. They wait for help to arrive But they are all running out of time and the zombies are approaching the mall. The dead are retuning to roam the earth. I thought that this was a very good zombie horror film with great acting from the cast. 7/10,7,0,0,2 November 2009

The Exorcist," A horror masterpiece...
","I think that The Exorcist is The scariest movie of all time, and the best horror film ever made. it is about, an Actress in Georgetown Washington, D.C., Chris lives with her twelve-year-old daughter Regan (Linda Blair), her personal assistant Sharon (Kitty Wynn), and two housekeepers. There are mysterious sounds coming from the attic of the house, which Chris thinks could be rats.

She turns up in Chris's bed one night, complaining that her own bed was 'shaking'.The strange happenings in the McNeil house begin to increase. Regan says that she has been playing with a Ouija board and claims that she has the ability to communicate with a spiritual entity all by herself. A nearby Catholic church is desecrated, a statue of the Virgin Mary painted. Chris her mother sees dramatic and dangerous changes in the behaviour and physical make-up of her 12-year-old daughter. Regan has brutally changed both in the way she looks and the way she acts, with violent outbursts on everyone who comes in contact into contact with her. Her worried mother gets in contact with a priest called Father Karras who comes to the conclusion that maybe Regan is possessed. At the same time Father Karras, a priest and a psychiatrist,is losing his faith, and he has deal with a sick mother who needs medical care he hasn't the money to provide for her.Meanwhile, Father Karras's mother falls ill and, due to a lack of money, she is placed in a old hospital to a ward full of mental patients.

He warns Karras about talking with the demon. When they enter Regan's bedroom, she begins speaking with a string of obscene words. Merrin and Karras recite the ritual of exorcism and Regan creates strange phenomena such as levitation, telekinesis, an abnormally long tongue, and strange vomiting. She constantly curses the priests and laughes evil laughter and verbal abuse. I have watched this film quite a few times now. And it is just as good as the first time.",10,1,2,8 October 2009
Saw III," Better than the first two Saw films....
","I thought that Saw 3 was better than the first two films. A 30 year old doctor called Lynn Denlon is kidnapped and locked in a room with no one other than Amanda and Jigsaw.

They discover The Book of the Dead and a tape recorder belonging to a professor, who also owns the cabin. One of them plays back what is recorded on the tape what happens to be resurrection passages translated from the (Book of the Dead) by the professor, where it unleashes an evil force in the woods. where one of the girls in the start of the film is raped by the trees. Each of the friends become possessed by one and find out from the tape that the only way to kill a person who is turned possessed is by completely dismembering their entire body. This film was one of the strongest video nasties that were banned in the UK in the 1980's",Null,0,1,8 October 2009
Saw II," A great horror film....
","I thought that Saw 2 was great horror film, which was as good as the first film. When detective Eric Matthews is called to a crime scene of a victim of Jigsaw, he finds a lead to the place where he is hidden. Once there, he realises that Jigsaw has trapped his son Daniel Matthews with three women and four men in a shelter, and they are inhaling a lethal nerve gas.

Saw 2 was just as good as the first film with its strong gore and violence.",7,0,1,17 October 2009
Paranormal Activity," First horror film that has actually effected me....
",I have to say that i really enjoyed watching Paranormal Activity. It started off slow to begin with. But once it got going i loved it. Its about a couple called Katie & Micah who decide that they want to record their nights sleep while they are sleeping. Soon after they begin to hear strange noises that they believe to be something evil. I loved the way in which the film was shot by using a hand held camera. I did not find this to be too much of a problem though which was good. Most of the film is also done on a tripod too whist both of them are sleeping. I really wish that i had the chance to have seen it in the cinema on a big screen it is a very creepy and haunting film. I was able to feel myself holding my breath when they went to sleep each time. It was actually the very first horror film that actually effected me. And also one of the most creepiest films I've ever seen. This is a really great film: 6/10,6,1,2,2 March 2011
Drag Me to Hell," One of the scariest horror films i have seen in the last five years....
","I thought that Drag Me To Hell was one of the One of the scariest horror films i have seen in the last five years. The film starts in Pasadena, California in 1969, a young Mexican couple rush to the home of medium Shaun San Dena (Flor De Maria Chahua). Their son had stolen jewelry from some Gypsies three days before, and since then, has been complaining of seeing and hearing things that are not normal. San Dena tries to help the boy in a séance, but she and the boy's parents can watch in horror as the boy is thrown from the balcony by an unseen force before being pulled into Hell by a demonic force. a young woman Christine Brown is responsible for loans in a bank and expects to be promoted to the position of assistant manager after dealing a big contract. However, the new hire Stu Rubin is a coworker that is against Christine to be selected by the manager Mr. Jacks to the position. When Mrs. Ganush, an old gypsy with an appearance of a witch that has been evicted by the bank, requests a third extension of her mortgage, Christine denies the loan to prove her boss that she can take tough decisions. Mrs. Ganush begs for the loan by begging and kissing the hem of Christine's skirt. but Christine shames the woman by calling security. In the night, Christine is attacked by Mrs. Ganush in the parking lot and they struggle. Mrs, Ganush removes a button from Christine's coat, curses it, and she returns the button to her and vanishes. Later, while going home with her psychologist boy-friend Clay Dalton, they pass by the fortune teller Rham Jas, and Christine decides to speak to him. He tells her that Christine has the fiend Lamia, the Black Goat, upon her. When Christine is haunted by the dark spirit during the night, Alone at home, which appears as the silhouette of a goat's head. The spirit breaks some windows, cuts the power, and throws Christine across the room, causing minor injuries Christine is attacked by the dark spirit, at work the next day, she has a violent nosebleed. Leaving work, she tries to track down Mrs. Ganush at her granddaughter's home. There Christine learns that Mrs. Ganush died the previous night, and her granddaughter is in. Christine causes a scene by accidentally knocking over Mrs. Ganush's dead body, and her granddaughter tells her that she deserves what is coming for her. I though that this was a great horror film from director Sam Raimi, with very good special effects, and sounds that made me jump several times during the film. 9/10",9,1,3,28 October 2009
Saw," A great horror film....
","I thought that Saw was a great film. Two men wake up at opposite sides of a dirty, disused bathroom, chained by their ankles to pipes. Between them lies a dead man clutching a hand-held tape player and a handgun They play the tapes. One is threatened, the other isn't. But they have a task: One must kill the other by 6:00, or his wife and daughter will die. They find hacksaws in a toilet, and try to cut the chains, but it doesn't work. They are the two newest victims of the Jigsaw Killer. In a flashback, we learn of Amanda, a girl who falls victim to the Jigsaw Killer. On her head is a mask, which is hooked into her lower jaw. There is a timer on it. Only one key will unlock it, and that key is in the digestive tract of her cell mate who lies paralysed on the opposite side of the room. If she doesn't unlock the mask in time, her lower jaw will be ripped wide open. I thought that this was a great horror film with a lot of strong bloody violence.",7,0,1,17 October 2009
Rosemary's Baby," Nearly as good as The Exorcist....
","I thought that Rosmary's Baby was a really great film. It is about a couple called Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse move into an apartment, in New York. They discover that their neighbours are a very friendly elderly couple named Roman and Minnie Castevet, and Guy begins to spend a lot of time with them. Strange things start to happen: a woman that Rosemary meets in the washroom dies in a a mysterious death, Rosemary has strange dreams and hears strange noises. Then Rosemary falls pregnant and begins to suspect something is going on with her neighbours who may have something to do with her unborn child have special plans lying ahead. I felt that this film had a good phsycological feel to it, and it was a well told story.",9,0,2,14 October 2009
Halloween," One of the best horrors ever made....
","I though that Halloween was one of the best horror films ever made. The year is 1963, Halloween night. The police are called to 43 Lampkin Ln in Haddonfield, Illinois to discover that 17 year Judith Myers had been stabbed to death, by her 6 year-old brother.

A Nightmare on Elm Street," One of the best horrors ever made....
","I found Nightmare On Elm Street to be one of the best horror films ever made. On Elm Street, Nancy Thompson and a group of her friends, Tina Gray, Rod Lane and Glen Lantz are being tormented by a clawed killer in their dreams named Freddy Krueger. Nancy is having nightmares about a frightening, badly-scarred figure who wears a glove with razor-sharp knives'. She soon discovers that her friends are having similar dreams.
