Mission: Impossible III," Now you're talking!
","The magic of I'm series on TV was the amazing teamwork. It was magical to see the characters look at each other without a word and make their plan work.Abrams succeeded with this new movie. We had a little of that in the first but it was all about betrayal. Which was good, after a fashion, but I would like to see even more teamwork. The second did not feel and look at all like Impossible Mission.Next time, don't place all focus on Ethan but on the team like it was on TV. I would like to see a cleanup in that IMF agency, don't you?This one will make it in my collection.",9,0,1,5 May 2006
Mission: Impossible II," Why does the bad guys have to be so dumb?
","The movie has great action scenes. However, the twirling around the various scenes almost made me sick to my stomack; I had to close my eyes from time to time.But why, oh why, does the bad guy has to be so dumb. He was dumber than the latest bond's.Even though I am tired of this lack of imagination, I enjoyed the movie.",7,0,0,5 June 2000

War of the Worlds," Another story not told
",How disappointing! What a beautiful movie wasted. Why is Spielberg bothering to base his movies on novel if he can't tell the story? None of the storyline is told during the movie. It is like telling the story of someone accidentally being there during the Independence Day invasion and not telling anything about the actual invasion.Why does Spielberg think that we need to hear a little scream in order to understand that the characters are scared? It makes me think on how he missed the story in Jurassic Park in the same manner. This is a repeating theme for this director.I hope somebody will tell this story with that kind of magnificence one day. Jean-Michel,3,3,5,8 July 2005
The Bourne Supremacy," Great movie, if only someone could steady the camera
","What is this?  Instead of showing us the action, they left it off and shook frenetically the camera instead. Is this a new way to save money or just be certain people wouldn't want to see the movie again? I am quite a bit disappointed that I was that much distracted.It was so awful I had to look elsewhere from time to time. It was distracting from the otherwise quite good action movie.
The actors were remarkable, so I assume the direction was good.  The plot was deployed in such a way I enjoyed discovering it, as I didn't read Ludlum's book. I even look forward seeing another Bourne movie hoping they will find another way to do action scenes.",6,0,1,30 July 2004
