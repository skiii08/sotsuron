The Longest Yard," An Admirable Remake
","This movie is one of the best and funniest remakes I have ever seen. The new cast was extremely funny and the general improved storyline is even better.Adam Sandler returns to the world of sports as Paul Krew, a suspended MVP football player that can find no more joy in life and gets landed in a harsh federal prison. He discovers a new passion as he leads a team of violent inmates in a football game against the much hated prison guards.Sandler delivers a spectacular performance and Chris Rock does an outstanding job as Caretaker, Krew's best friend.A great movie to watch if you're a football buff or someone who simply enjoys a good comedy.My Rating: 8/10 in general 7/10 for a sport movie 8/10 for a comedy",8,0,2,2 March 2006
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Perfect Virgin Picker-Upper
","Steve Carell bursts out of the closet of support acting to star in his own hit movie. I can't imagine someone better for the part than this man. The movie starts with a continuous stream of funny scenes and moves into a romantic mood leaving you feeling good about yourself.The producers were thrilled when their low budget movie was met with such enthusiasm and made the top ten list in most of the cities it was shown in. This proves that our age is not ruled by high-tech, state-of-the-art effects movies with violence and nudity.A great picker-upper for virgins and a great movie to watch with someone you love. I highly recommend watching it and buying it on DVD because this will definitely be a future collectible.",8,1,2,22 January 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Wait a second... I didn't know that we had power hoses in our bodies!
","Remember those old movies where what happens on screen can possibly happen in real life? Well this is not one of them. Quentin Tarantino emerges from no where to establish himself as a well-known director. In his pursuit to become a film making legend, Tarantino proves to everyone how the mere sight of blood, something that made us cringe in years past, has become a must see in modern film. Unfortunately, instead of utilizing this ticket-selling obsession in proportion, Tarantino completely goes all out and overuses it.The Japanese style film with a story that does not make sense shows that this film was targeted at violence-hungry knuckleheads with a craving for blood. I never knew it could happen, but it did. A story about some pregnant super-agent bride who loses her baby and vows revenge turned out to be one of the top selling movies of the year.If Tarantino meant for this movie to be a sarcastic comedy, then he did an outstanding job. If he meant it to be a respectable action film, boy... does he need to go back to film school.Regrettably impressive fight sequences are the only savior for this lost cause. The special effects were overdone and the acting performances were laughable.If you do decide to see this movie, make sure you wear a rain coat and carry an umbrella, because considering the blood hits just about everything, it just as well can hit you.My rating: 5/10 in General 6.5/10 for an Action Film",5,1,3,29 March 2006
V for Vendetta," A spectacle worthy of admiration!
","Upon first hearing the news of the Wachowski brothers releasing yet another highly anticipated movie, I was persistent to watch it as soon as possible. With the overwhelming world-wide success of 'The Matrix' trilogy, 'V for Vendetta' was set to become yet another spectacle to be praised by generations to come.Supported by a highly complex and puzzling plot, this psychological thriller captures your attention from the very beginning and throws you into a world of lies and puzzles where you piece together the pieces to reveal the shocking and troubling truth. Evey is an average working woman whose life changes drastically when she is rescued by a mysterious stranger from a gang of corrupt policemen. Returning the favor, she helps him escape arrest and gets knocked out. Feeling sympathy for the heroic young lady, V takes her to his lair where he reveals to her his mission. They help each other overcome the hardships and obstacles of their oppressive world.The story is set in London in a time not too far from the present. After epidemics and wars strike the world, a dictatorial government takes control of London and transforms it into a regime much similar to that of Germany during World War 2. Using fear and deception, the government controls the people like puppets and robs them of their rights, money, and liberties at will. Escaping from what seems like a concentration camp, V takes his fate into his own hands and decides to correct the wrongs of the government and lead the people in revolution.The astounding special effects are perhaps only exceeded by the unprecedented and skillful performances by Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman. The movie is a wonderful and accurate depiction of the graphic novels which they are based off and the additional skill and powerful writing ability of the Wachowski brothers place this film high above today's standards and welcome it as an alteration to the extremely popular Comedy genre that is sweeping the world.Definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen. Highly recommended. I give it a perfect 10 out of 10.",10,3,6,17 April 2006
