The Sound of Music," Beautiful, dramatic, sensual
","The Sound of Music is undoubtedly the best movie I have ever seen.  The scenery, music, singing and casting were superb.  It was a pity that Christopher Plumber was not allowed to do his own singing but instead had a voice over. Julie Andrews acting certainly deserved the Oscar that it was denied. My favorite scene was of Julie Andrews leaning against the wall in that beautiful blue dress, watching as The Captain sang to the children in the lounge. What more can I say, I have seen it so many times and never tire of it, each time I see it I realize that I have missed something before, each time is a new revelation to me. Will go down as far as I am concerned as the movie of the century.",10,1,7,12 July 1999
