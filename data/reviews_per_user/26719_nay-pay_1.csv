Resident Evil: Afterlife," wow
","I just think it's strange that there have been 1 or 2 decent films in this series. Extinction was a decent movie. How do they keep getting Mila to come back and do these terrible ones. I mean that's barely B quality. I only got 1/3rd of the way through this junk it's so painful.. i mean PAINFUL. To even attempt to watch this mindbogglingly terrible 'film' making i need pot, alcohol and many pills. But then I'd be dead before the movie ended. So I guess my question is, how does a movie this terrible get anywhere near the rating it has? I mean, I can't trust the ratings on this website anymore. I've seen quality, good movies get worse ratings than this thing. It's disturbing I tell you. What is wrong with people? If i had the option i would rate it -10 out of 100. IMDb should be a good site to reference title choices but it's not... I'm afraid.",1,5,11,10 March 2012
