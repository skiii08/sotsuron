Changeling," overrated
","Let me start by saying Angelina Jolie cannot act to save her life and I can't for the life of me understand why they keep putting her in movies. OK, she's attractive, but that doesn't give you a free pass. The movie actually had potential but then it flew off into every direction possible. Why was the LAPD credited for finding the kid in the first place? Wasn't it the police in Illinois that found the fake one? Wasn't the fact that she was going around publicly telling her story a million times more damaging to the LAPD than for them to just admit they made a mistake? The only way the police would have gone to such insane lengths to cover it up is if they had been the ones that killed him. The whole thing makes no sense. Besides, it's her own damn fault for leaving a young child home alone with the DOOR OPEN. Seriously, way to parent.",2,6,21,20 March 2009
Miracle," pretty good
","I was really excited for this to come out because I heard stories about this event from my dad when I was growing up, who went to that fateful game. Kurt Russell did a great job as Herb Brooks and even got the accent down pretty well. The players didn't do too awful given that they aren't actors; they're actually real players (besides the goalie). I've watched the actual game on tape and the one in the movie is stunningly close. They must have worked really hard to make that happen. All in all a very good movie. By the way, some tool in another post complained that they didn't know the game was about to end because it was the end of the 3rd period and there was a period 4 on the scoreboard (for basketball). If you don't know the absolute basic rules of the sport you're watching, don't blame the sport. Did you realize they were on ice or not?",8,1,1,14 April 2009
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What in God's name?
","The movie's rating on this site proves that George Lucas need not do anything more than take a crap in a paper bag and people will love it. I was young enough when this came out in the theater to be genuinely excited about seeing it. I stood in line for hours and the whole bit. I went in thinking this was going to be the greatest thing since sliced bread and came out cursing the day George Lucas was born. This was so shockingly bad that I boycotted the rest of the series until a few years ago when I was forced to watch them by my Star Wars obsessed wife. First of all, casting a child in ANY role, let alone a lead role, is dangerous territory to be treading on, but I know there was no choice in this case. However, can you at least cast someone who can act? This kid was so annoying it made me want to go upstairs and destroy the projector. There are so many awful aspects to this movie that they can't all be listed here, but Jar-Jar Binks is easily the most annoying character ever devised. Whoever created it must be living in a bunker somewhere because I assume there plenty of p*ssed off people looking for revenge. Both Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are talented actors, but they sleepwalk through this performance, and with good reason. Would you be proud if you were acting in this?",1,10,20,14 April 2009
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," wow
","After Episode I successfully crushed my fond childhood memories of the Star Wars franchise, I was obviously reluctant to give this one a chance, and didn't. Unfortunately, my wife is a die hard fan and I was forced to watch it. Now, Episode III was actually decent aside from the dialog (but you have to expect that from Lucas) and Christianson's wince-inducing acting, but Episode II was so jaw-droppingly bad that I was actually uncomfortable during some of the scenes. The dialog between Annikan and Obi Wan had to have been written by a child, there's no other explanation. Even Lucas can't be that bad, can he? Oh wait... Aside from that, nothing much happened for the entire movie. The one thing I ask from a Star Wars movie is that it not be dull. Is that too much to ask? Apparently, it is.",1,0,4,23 March 2009
Armageddon," Michael Bay, you've done it again
","I got the feeling watching this movie, that there must have been a room full of people brainstorming a list of all possible movie clichés and found a way to throw them all into one movie. Ben Affleck is so bad that he has the ability to single-handedly ruin a movie. Although he wasn't even the worst part about this. I have a sneaking suspicion that NASA isn't going to leave the fate of the world into a bunch of nobodies after about a minute of training. Bruce Willis is wooden, as usual, Liv Tyler's acting is hilarious and Ben Affleck, well, he was Ben Affleck. Steve Bushemi, who I normally like, was annoying, but I blame that on the writers. That scene with Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler and the animal crackers was easily one of the most embarrassing in the history of film. 'Deep Impact' has some similar clichés in it. The goodbyes at the end, the astronauts sacrificing themselves, etc., but it was still mildly entertaining. This movie was just an embarrassment. Liv Tyler trying to act sad at the end actually made me feel bad for her, because if it was me acting that badly, and I went back and watched, I wouldn't want to go on living. Probably the worst part of it was that Aerosmith song that makes me want to shove knitting needles in my ears to end the torment. That song is so bad that it caused me to retroactively hate Aerosmith.",1,3,5,1 April 2009
Knowing," Cage's character summed up the movie when he said 'There's no purpose.'.
","I'll start by saying this could have been a good movie; even an excellent one, but the execution was downright awful. The first 90% of the movie was an absolute waste and it would have been more integral to the ending if the main characters had just sat out in the front lawn the entire time watching the grass grow. It seems the entire purpose of the predictive numbers was to get the kids to those coordinates at a certain time. Although, even that didn't matter because the aliens intervened and did it themselves anyway. It would have made a lot more sense for the aliens to do nothing since the parents wouldn't have suspected anything that way and said aliens wouldn't have had to engage in a car chase. The point is, I have a difficult time seeing the good in a movie that unravels itself completely in the last 10 minutes. It's lazy and a borderline dues ex machina.",2,2,7,29 August 2011
Pearl Harbor," I hate you Michael Bay
","Why, oh why, do they keep letting this man make movies? I get that there has to be a certain level of deviation from reality when making a movie about a historical event in order to make it more exciting, so I'm willing to overlook that part, but there are so many other things wrong with this. I don't know how many more times I can say this, but, STOP PUTTING BEN AFFLECK IN MOVIES FOR THE LOVE OF GOD! He's terrible and he ruins otherwise good movies (not that this qualifies, of course). Does there really have to be a ridiculous love story? Is it a requirment made by the suits in order to get funding for your movie? It adds nothing at all to the story. This is a movie about the Pearl Harbor attack (sort of), not some awkward love story between two insanely irritating characters.",1,1,2,26 May 2010
Insidious," Ugh...
","Why does Hollywood have no concept of money or common sense? This family lives in a $500K - $1 Million house, depending on where the story is supposed to take place, they have three kids, one of whom requires constant medical care and the wife doesn't work. The wife claims she needs to move because the place is haunted. So, does the husband, who hasn't seen anything to indicate ghosts in the house, maybe question his wife's sanity as the most plausible explanation? Of course not! Instead, he does the following: 'Well, sure honey, any reasonable person would think you're insane, we have thousands of dollars of medical bills to pay per month for our comatose son, and I'm a freaking teacher, so yeah, OF COURSE we can just up and leave this house and move into another mansion. It's only money, baby!'. Despite all that, this movie is just your average, clichÃ©-ridden mess full of *gasp* jump scares which are the laziest horror staples money can buy.",1,16,32,28 August 2011
2012," Oh dear...
","I went into this with very low expectations for obvious reasons. I don't ask much from my disaster movies, but can you please show me something new? Please? The bombardment of clichés is overwhelming. There has to be a checklist somewhere in a Hollywood vault that displays the requirements for any disaster movie. The main protagonist has to be a divorced or separated dad whose life is in disarray but who is redeemed by the end of the movie. The step-dad must be devoid of all personality lest we start caring when he is inevitably killed off so the main character can move in on his ex. Any antagonist in the movie (who is this guy supposed to be anyway, the Secretary of Defense? I don't think it ever says, but I easily could have missed it, as I started zoning out) MUST be white and secondary protagonists (the President of the United States, the geologist, the doctor from India, the Tibetan man who helps the main characters and the President's daughter) must be minorities. Murphy's Law must apply and everything that could go wrong, does. However, since we know everything will turn out fine at the end anyway, there is no tension whatsoever. Finally, there should have been a disclaimer at the beginning that read: 'WARNING: In the following movie, product placements will attack your senses at every opportunity'. I guess when your budget is a quarter of a million dollars, you'll take any money you can get. I get that this is a movie, but some plausibility would be nice. Is Jackson Curtis secretly Aquaman? The old world record for holding your breath was around 5 min. After his stunt, it's apparently up to 20.",1,12,19,14 December 2009
The Happening," It hurts
","I know this man is capable of making a decent movie. 'Unbreakable' was very good, 'Signs' was decent and even the much-ridiculed 'The Village' had it's charm, but this movie was so excruciatingly terrible that it almost has to be a cruel joke played on an unsuspecting public (although, with his latest slew of bombs, we now expect garbage). It's a well-known fact that Marky Mark can't act his way out of a wet paper bag, but his performance in this is nothing short of genocidal. Watching the 'actors' perform in this was embarrassing to watch, to put it mildly. For a movie titled 'The happening', nothing happens at all. The movie just ends for no apparent reason. Essentially the same thing happens in 'Signs', but at least that one was entertaining and well-acted. Even the little girl in that was Oscar-worthy compared to Wahlberg. Even the suicide scenes were hardly B-movie material. The scene where the lions rip the guys arms off was supposed to be frightening but the special effects were on par with a high school play. This director (I can't spell his name and don't feel like looking it up) should be ashamed. If he honestly put effort into this, his career is finished, or at least should be. Although, they keep paying Michael Bay to make movies, so I guess this guy has a long career ahead of him. Sigh.",1,4,7,3 March 2010
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," ridiculous and contrived
","Watching a movie for the sole purpose of seeing the chemistry between 'Brad' and 'Angelina' is not nearly enough for me. They have no chemistry as far as I can tell anyway. First of all, what 'agencies' are they working for? They seemed to be simply private hit companies, yet they had the funding for all the surveillance equipment, military weaponry, etc. If they are government agencies, why would they be competing with one another since they would have been from the same government? It simply made no sense. Secondly, if their respective agencies wanted them dead because they were married, why not just off the two themselves while they were least expecting it? Why go through the trouble of pitting them against each other, only to have to go after them anyway after they discovered the plot and lose many lives and probably millions of dollars? Beyond belief and just a contrivance to keep the ridiculous plot rolling. The storyline actually had potential, which was why I watched in the first place, but it didn't deliver it even remotely well. Horrible. It gets 2 stars because of a few decent action scenes.",2,1,4,19 December 2005
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," What in God's name is going on here?
","I was actually excited about this movie as I really enjoyed the first one. Where do I begin with what's wrong with this movie? It was essentially the U.S. Military vs. the Deceptecons. There were basically three Autobots in the movie: Bumblebee (who somehow couldn't talk again, even though he could at the end of the first one), and TWO Jar-Jar Binks's. Ironhide and Ratchet were in it but inexplicably absent for most of the movie and some other one that never transformed so I had no idea what it was supposed to be. There were a pile of new Decepticons but little to no new Autobots. Oprimus Prime was dead for most of the movie but was resurrected to defeat the 'bad guys' is less than two minutes by somehow acquiring some advanced weaponry from an 'old' Deceptecon with a cane for God's sake! Ahh!!!. Shia Labouf and Megan Fox were awful. First of all, Megan Fox couldn't act her way out of wet paper bag so watching her trying to emote was just painful. The special effects somehow turned out worse than the first movie. Michael Bay's attempt to add comedy to this was laughable, and I don't mean that it in a good way. The scene where the kid's mom gets high on marijuana was the FIRST time I wanted to walk out, but certainly not the last. It's really depressing because the first one was so good. Shame on you Michael Bay for destroying a perfectly good series. Finally, what was the deal with a transformer turning into a person? I don't remember them having that capability when I was a kid. I guess they double as Terminators now.",1,11,25,29 June 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," umm....
","I've never been much of a star wars fan, but I had the usual love of the original series as a child. The first two prequels were embarrassing at best, and this last one wasn't much better. Lucas spends far too much time on special effects and imagery and too little time on dialog and story. Haden Christianson's acting is atrocious and painful to watch. Lucas has absolutely no business writing dialog in the first place, but the banter between Anakin and Padme is inexcusable. The way Anakin finally becomes Vader makes no sense whatsoever and was simply a quick way to get from point A to point B. The only reason this didn't get a one is because the effects were cool and I was impressed by the light saber battles.",4,2,4,21 December 2005
Braveheart," Hi, my name is Mel Gibson. My hobbies include DUIs and taking sh*ts on history.
","I'm an American but with a Scottish heritage so I suppose it would be easy for me to overlook blinding disregard for history in the case of this movie. However, I just can't. There's no excuse for this. If you want to make a hack/slash film, either make the characters fictional or make them at least kind of historically accurate, not neither. William Wallace and the princess didn't even exist in the same time period, let alone fall in love. What the h*ll is going on here? The film itself really isn't bad. The cinematography is outstanding, but I just can't suspend disbelief enough to enjoy it. This ranks up there with the awful movie 'Pearl Harbor' in terms of historical accuracy, if 'Pearl Harbor' had included a scene where the Japanese dropped a hydrogen bomb on Hawaii.",3,29,61,23 August 2010
