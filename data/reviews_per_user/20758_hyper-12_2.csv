The Blair Witch Project," Get a life, please!
","I'm so tired of reading about how annoyed and angry people were after they saw this movie...that it didn't live up to their expectations, that it wasn't 'scary', that it was too atypical and unconventional, etc. To say they didn't like the movie is one thing, but some are SO mad you'd think they had a million dollar bet riding on the whole thing. Please!No movie is going to appeal to EVERYONE. Lesson number one, guys! Blair Witch is NOT meant to be conventional, or like your typical horror movie. There are no obvious and contrived jolts or scary moments to make you jump out of your seat. You want conventional, go see 'The Haunting'. The only thing that'll scare you about that movie is the money you wasted on it. Blair Witch is not about those silly little horror film conventions. It's not about a monster hunting three kids. It's all about psychological horror -- watching three people steadily go crazy and turn on each other for a time. It's about suspense and build up, not payoff. I thought the ending was brilliant. It left you asking questions.I credit the filmmakers for taking huge risks in style and technique. For turning a wholly noncommerical project into a commerical success. It's a breath of fresh air. I give the movie an 'A'.",Null,1,1,16 August 1999
The Blair Witch Project," A masterpiece of low-budget filmmaking
","It's nice to see a movie that's such a clever throw-back to some of the thrilling horror films of the late '70s and '80s like 'Halloween' and 'Friday the 13th'. This movie and its success only proves you don't need a big budget..or ANY budget..to make a successful movie! It disturbs me to hear about a backlash developing over Blair Witch, and yet it doesn't surprise me. Anytime something becomes successful, there's always some group out there wanting to bring it down. Those who don't like Blair Witch need everything spelled out them for them and made obvious. This is a movie about 'sound' and 'acting' and in that respect it succeeds brilliantly. I hope it indeed does redefine the horror genre, if not the future of filmmaking itself.",Null,0,1,5 August 1999
