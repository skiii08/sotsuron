Raiders of the Lost Ark," 'I'm missing you already'
","Sallah wasn't the only one who was saddened to say goodbye to Indiana Jones. At the end of this showing at the Garland Theatre, we all had to bid him a reluctant adieu. Anybody that hates snakes, Nazis and unscrupulous treasure hunters is a hero to be admired. This was the first film in the saga of Indiana Jones, and what a character he was and will be again, if the fourth film in the series makes it to the big screen next year. It would be hard to top this first one, although the third picture had some more character development than the others and Sean Connery nearly stole the flick from Ford in one of Connery's most memorable roles since playing James Bond. Let's hope he will appear in the next one in a flashback, since he was killed off in his last appearance. There's little I can add to the hundreds of user comments posted here already. But I will say that we can all thank MAGNUM P.I. for RAIDERS' success. Had Tom Selleck been able to leave MAGNUM and play the Indiana Jones role as Lucas and Spielberg apparently wanted, he, not Ford, would have been the face of the franchise. I can't see anyone but Harrison Ford playing Indy. Perhaps Selleck could have had the kind of career that Ford enjoyed after playing Indy, but I doubt it. Selleck never got such a plum role offered again and the casting decision of Ford for Selleck makes for a terrific what-if scenario had it gone the other way. It's probably my second favorite what-if Hollywood story. Number one on my list goes back to 1968 when a series called STAR TREK was cancelled because the NBC network thought it was too cerebral and too expensive to produce, so they put ROWAN AND MARTIN'S LAUGH-IN in the show's time slot. When STAR TREK was cancelled, it became the Cinderella that was rejected by the evil network, that became a hit in syndication and went on to spawn a series of successful movies and TV series as no other TV series has done before or since. If the fans had gotten their fill of STAR TREK after a few more seasons on the network, would it have gained the impetus to take off like it did with later movies and TV sequels? I think not. And neither would it be the same RAIDERS trilogy without Harrison Ford. Dale Roloff",10,0,1,5 August 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Jack Sparrow meets 'Mary Potter' in uninspiring sequel
","I should have guessed something was wrong when I showed up at my neighborhood Garland Theatre and there were only a handful of patrons to watch this latest PIRATES flick. Of course, it was 9:45 pm, on a school night and this was the last day of its 3-week run at the Garland. But when such a paltry crowd shows up, it makes for a bad omen of things to come. Unfortunately, my fears were realized. This is not to say that this latest epic is a bad picture. It's just not up to the standards of the first two, although many of my fellow commentators rate the third PIRATES ahead of the second. For one thing, the whole story in this series has taken a decidedly darker turn from the first film, which was suitable for younger children without being dumbed down for their elders. The sequel, with its Kraken and bloodthirsty squid crew, was not at all suitable for younger folks, and the most recent work has a much darker tone, with very little of the warmth and humor that the characters brought to life in CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL, and to a lesser extent, DEAD MEN'S CHEST. AT WORLD'S END manages to bring in some intriguing characters, but never really develops them. The Oriental captain, played by Chow Yun-Fat, never gets to do much and his back story with Jack Sparrow should have been filled in with some flashbacks. The same can be said for Jack's father. After so much hype about Keith Richards coming aboard the PIRATES franchise, he has few lines and little contact with Jack. On the other hand, the witch plays what I call a 'Mary Potter' character, who's there to bring Jack back from the dead, but performs no magic, and instead wanders around mumbling mostly unintelligible dialogue. Her character and the evil Lord Beckett and his henchmen, which later includes the disgraced commodore, serve to bog the narrative down, and their villainy lacks the spirit that Barbossa and Davy Jones gave the first two films. All in all, my main gripes here are that this sequel is much too long, leans too much to the dark side, and it fails to develop some of its more interesting new characters, although I really liked the scenes with the one-eyed pirate and his bald buddy, not to mention the funny bits with the monkey and parrot. Will Turner also gets short shrift in the plot, but the actors playing Elizabeth, Jack, Barbossa and Davy Jones make up for the deficit with outstanding performances. And the visuals, action and rousing score make this a worthy film to see and to own. It's just not up to par with the first two in the series, and if the Disney people can't do any better than this, it's time for the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN to walk the plank when it comes to further sequels.

The Bourne Ultimatum," Like a fine wine, 'Bourne' improves with age
","In most spy thrillers, the villains are people from outside the U.S. who run roughshod over the world with their military, political or economic machinations. But not since Rambo has a cinematic hero taken on our own government as the bad guys. Like Rambo, his training has turned him into a nearly invincible fighting machine, who ironically now opposes his former bosses. As each sequel has progressed from the first BOURNE outing, Jason has attempted to come back home, like a loyal dog, but his masters keep barring the door. This dogged pursuit of his goal has made Matt Damon's character a screen icon right up there with Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt and Harrison Ford's Jack Ryan. This latest 'Bourne' installment, which I caught at my favorite Garland cinema house, is as equally well-made and entertaining as its predecessors. Great locations set the scene for great action sequences like the chase scenes on the streets of Tangier and New York City, and the fight scene in the bathroom with the asset is arguably Jason's best ever albeit shot at a little too fast a pace. Throw in some fine character development, a good musical score and a story full of suspense, and you'll find yourself strapped in for a great thrill ride. And without giving too much away, the story comes full circle back to the same physical environment from where Jason began his odyssey. I'm really looking forward to popping the cork on the next entry in the series, especially now that Jason seems to have picked an an ally and possible love interest in the form of Nicky Parsons.

Seabiscuit," 'He was a small horse, barely 15 hands'
","In the golden age of sports culminating in the late 30's, the three greatest athletes in 1938 were Joe Louis, Lou Gehrig and this 'small horse' described by the narrator when he's first seen on screen.While there have been many outstanding films featuring animals in the title role (BIG RED, THE YEARLING, THE BLACK STALLION, to name a few), none have captured the era, the human characters and the four-legged star quite so well as in this warm and tender tale of the horse who 'fixed us, every one of us.' As a history buff, I'm distressed at how Gary Ross fixes the facts in this film, altering or deleting key elements. No mention in the film was made of Red Pollard's romance and subsequent 40-year marriage to the private nurse who cared for him in Boston while he recuperated from his leg injury. Ross admits that he changed the sugar cube given to Seabiscuit to an apple when he first meets Pollard, but he doesn't show the nudge of Red's shoulder which followed. Smith's training schemes could have been been detailed better, such as the use of an 'entourage' of a cow pony, stray dog and spider monkey to help calm him.And the picture could have better explained how Red was blinded in a riding accident instead of an apparent boxing injury as this flick suggests. Perhaps Gary Ross made these changes to distinguish his work from the author's, to put his own personal stamp on the film. For all its faults, SEABISCUIT rates as one of the best feel-good movies of this or any other century. It truly deserves an honored place in any serious movie lover's film collection and is worth the effort to see it again on the big screen, as I recently did at my neighborhood Garland Theatre.

Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," 'Well, you got me, pal'
","Having just seen this at the Garland Theatre,a second-run discount theater in my neighborhood,I'm glad I didn't pay for a full price cineplex ticket. Not that it's a stinker, but it just doesn't qualify as a very good film in the superhero genre. There's a telling bit in the wedding scene where Marvel honcho Stan Lee is refused entry to the event. Stan and Marvel have not had a lot going their way this year. SPIDERMAN 3 is doing just OK at the box office, but, worse, it's collecting less than stellar reviews from some quarters who say it's the worst of the trilogy.The X-MEN franchise is going downhill also and there don't seem to be any comic superheroes waiting in the wings for Marvel to take Hollywood by storm as Spidey and X-Men did. If it's any consolation, Superman and Batman are not doing much better on the big screen. These things go in cycles, though, and I'm sure the comic book superhero will rebound again. It will take some new faces and characters to do it probably, but the superhero is not dead, it's just like a sleeping volcano that's bound to erupt again. Getting back to this movie, I give it good marks for some clever plot devices. The wedding was played way too straight, though, and the director should have either given it more humor or more suspense. The switching of super powers was another thing that should have been given more play, and the possible breakup of the team should also have been emphasized more than with just a few lines like my summary quote by Thing to Johnny. At just 91 minutes, this film was just way too short to develop much of the storyline better. Sometimes, more is not better, but in this case, what I saw on the screen just left me wanting more. It was mildly entertaining, but SILVER SURFER never got me, pal. Dale Roloff",6,2,5,10 August 2007
2001: A Space Odyssey," Best movie of the '60's, possibly of all-time
","I make the claim above knowing that there are indeed other films with better acting, bigger box-office numbers, more awards and greater love by audiences and acclaim by critics alike in both the original print versions and celluloid forms. Movies like CASABLANCA, TITANIC, BEN-HUR and GONE WITH THE WIND fit the bill with having those other attributes. But no other film I can imagine has had the impact on the way movies were made after it was released and no other major motion picture has combined rich classical music themes with such stunning visual images in such a way that it captivated audiences and budding young filmmakers alike to expect more in what was shown on the screen. Later films like STAR WARS, SUPERMAN, SPIDERMAN, and THE MATRIX built on Kubrick's vision and added to it. The makers of all these special-effects driven films that came after this owe Kubrick a great debt. He set the bar pretty high for both moviegoers' and movie makers' expectations, and that drives the film industry even today. Back to this film now, there are four observations I made in seeing this film again recently which I hadn't noticed previously. (1)I recently experienced the loss of a loved one who came to an end while battling the late stages of Alzheimers. Seeing the unplugging of HAL by Bowman and the way that HAL loses its faculties bit by bit until one of its last memories is recalling a song from its early stages of programming, caused me to think how much our human brain functions like HAL (or vice versa.) My late sister underwent some of the same processes as HAL as she delighted in telling me anecdotes from her past, which she remembered better than the contents of her morning breakfast. (2)I think SPARTACUS and 2001 are much alike in Kubrick's view of how man can triumph over adversity, whether it's put there by man or machine, and then rise to a level never imagined. In both cases, we can become slaves to man or machines, but Kubrick shows that we can overcome the odds. (3)Another vision of Kubrick not foreseen in 1968 is that the super sophisticated aliens in this film utilize these giant cellphone-like structures for space flight and other uses. We shouldn't be surprised that these ubiquitous devices fly, since today they do so many things. I think it would be neat to own a cellphone with a ring tone emulating the humming sound featured by the monoliths in this film. (4)I find it curious that in the first 18 minutes of the film the screenwriters seem to suggest that the aliens by use of their monolith influenced our ape-like ancestors to become violent, as if that advances their evolutionary development. As much as this and the Cain vs. Abel Biblical story point out that man's inhumanity to man goes back a long ways, I can't see how the aliens believe that introducing this trait into man's development could be a positive step for mankind. However, one positive step I can recommend for mankind is to see this picture on a big screen. It's not enough to own this film for your personal collection, it must be experienced on a big screen in a movie house or something similar like a screening on a library wall, where the downtown Spokane Public Library presented it. Film reviewer Roger Ebert says that seeing movies this way is best in a theater setting surrounded by an audience that delivers its reaction to it.I further believe that like mixing Scotch with water, it's a bit sacrilegious to combine 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY with your home boob tube screen. At your next opportunity, make that odyssey yourself to see it the way that all great motion pictures should be seen. Dale Roloff",10,1,3,18 April 2007
Glory Road," Sports fans will enjoy it, but it may strike out with others
","In a state that's so football crazy, whether it's high school, college or professional, it's great to see a movie that celebrates a Texas team that won the state's only NCAA tournament championship. Actually, in 15 of the first 20 NCAA tournaments, there was at least one school from the Lone Star state, but none made it past the Final Four until that magical 1965-66 season. It was no overnight feat that Haskins accomplished (this film shows him starting in 1965, when in actuality his Texas Western team had reached the NCAA Sweet Sixteen a year before that.) When you see the beginning disclaimer 'Based on the true story...' you know there will be scenes that are either untrue or overly dramatized for effect, but it still amazes me that films like this and SEABISCUIT contain gross historical inaccuracies. But history never stood in the way of a good Hollywood film and it probably never will. All that being said, I was mildly disappointed in this movie. The characters never really engaged me on an emotional level. There was no real effort to bring much humor or romance into the movie, and it could have used more of either or both as a contrast to the racial tensions that were all too real back then. Still, it makes for an interesting look at how the culture has changed in 40-plus years and it does OK as a sports movie. But it's a long way from being up there with some of the truly great ones like THE PRIDE OF THE YANKEES or the aforementioned SEABISCUIT. And as an overall lover of movies, I feel it's worth watching as a better-than-average sports movie, but not particularly great for those who aren't interested in that genre.

Tombstone," 'I guess you could say we did our good deed for the day, Mayor'
","Whether or not Wyatt Earp ever made such a statement, it sounds like something we'd expect from a full-fledged western legend: short and sweet, with a trace of modesty. While Kurt Russell was not the biggest star to ever play Wyatt (Such honors go to the likes of Henry Fonda, Burt Lancaster, Kevin Costner and James Garner and the quintessential TV portrayal by Hugh O'Brian), he does a decent job with the part and Val Kilmer heads an outstanding supporting cast. Many actors have played Doc Holliday on big and small screen, the earliest I can find on the IMDb website is Harvey Clark in LAW FOR TOMBSTONE (1937), while others have included Cesar Romero,Kirk Douglas, Victor Mature, both Dennis and Randy Quaid, even Willie Nelson and Adam West.Doc Holliday has always been my favorite among all the historic gunslingers of the Old West. Earp and Hickok may have been more of the white hat sort of hero, but Doc made no pretense about having redeeming qualities, except for one: he stood by his friend Wyatt when the chips were down. No lawman or cowboy could ask any more or expect any less from a true friend. Of all the portrayals of Doc, Kilmer's version is one of the best ever done for this complex man. His pathos and comic relief that he brings to his part turned this picture into an outstanding example of its genre. In real life, the western hero was never a totally William S. Hart/Hopalong Cassidy type of good guy, but a human being with flaws just like anybody else. In fact, sometimes the flaws that a western hero has to overcome make his character all the more extraordinary and entertaining, like the Duke does with his Ethan character in THE SEARCHERS. TOMBSTONE's not in a class with the classic all-time westerns, of which THE SEARCHERS is one, but it's a good tale of how a vicious outlaw gang gets its comeuppance from two of the greatest gunfighters who ever strapped on their shootin' irons to clean up their town.

The Wizard of Oz," 'Poor little kid, I hope she gets home alright'
","Professor Marvel needn't have worried about Dorothy. She had what another screen icon displayed in an equally memorable role 30 years later: True grit.The 'true grit' that Mattie Ross admires in Rooster Cogburn was something she also possesses and I find a lot of similar character traits in Mattie and Dorothy. In 1939, audiences then loved Garland's performance as the girl who survives falling into a pigpen,losing her dog,riding out a tornado,then has to battle a witch and an obstreperous wizard on her journey back home. I mention the Duke because her Dorothy and his Rooster role both netted them Oscars in their somewhat similar careers. Her Oscar was a smaller honorary statuette (which she called a 'Munchkin' award) given for her work as Dorothy. The Duke's Oscar was close to an honorary one also. It was far from his best work and his other nominations for THE ALAMO and SANDS OF IWO JIMA were much beneath his better efforts in RED RIVER, THE QUIET MAN and THE SEARCHERS, just to name a few. I think the older members of the Academy voting the awards wanted to give Wayne the prize for his body of work to that point, partly because they were a bit shocked at the popularity of THE MIDNIGHT COWBOY, an X-rated film that garnered best actor nominations for Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight. I think the Academy knew they both had long careers facing them and would be up again for awards, and they do have 3 Oscars and 11 nominations between them. The other two actors up for the award then were equally deserving. Richard Burton had received his sixth Oscar nomination and went on to a record seven nominations without wins and Peter O'Toole had picked up his fourth nomination and just this year broke Burton's record with his 8th non-winning nomination. I'm sure a lot of the voting members felt O'Toole and Burton more deserving of the Oscar, but sentiment for the aging Duke won out and it was probably a very narrow margin of votes that carried the day. While the Duke's Oscar came near the end of his career, Judy's came when she was just getting started. But like Wayne's Rooster role, her most honored and beloved screen character represents just the tip of an iceberg. She earned two other Oscar nominations and sold a lot of records and was a popular TV performer. As John Wayne could never overcome his western/war hero screen persona (and probably never really would have given that up), Garland was never able to find a plum part like Dorothy again either. That's not to say she went totally downhill from there. By all accounts, she had an outstanding career, plagued though it was by personal troubles. But Dorothy put her star up in the cosmos and she could never reach that high again. Her plucky character and her memorable friends and foes in the enchanting world of Oz set this film apart as one of the greatest of all time and deservedly so.I just saw this on the big screen at my neighborhood Garland Theatre. Although like millions of others who had seen this on television more than once, it was still a great story brought to life by the magic of cinema. I don't know if I suddenly became allergic to popcorn, but the climax brought tears to my eyes. Few films do that for me and I was surprised at my reaction to what I thought was an old chestnut I'd seen more times than I can remember. Maybe I'm just getting old and decrepit and overly sentimental for the good old days or maybe it's because this film can still carry a powerful message to new generations seeing it anew. I'd like to believe it's more of the latter than the former. Dale Roloff",10,7,10,12 August 2007
