The Blair Witch Project," Bleh
","There have been many other 'found footage' movies since BWP, some really good, most terrible and cheap, and perhaps BWP was exciting on first release. But all I can say, after seeing this recently for the first time, after seeing many better found footage movies, is that 'this movie blows'. It is so terrible and annoying that I had a difficult time sitting through it. It may have been the 'first', but it does not hold up in any way to its descendants. And I found its narrator one of the most annoying characters in film history. I give it two stars, probably one more than it deserves.",2,5,8,12 January 2015
