Walk the Line," Incredible performances by Joaquin and Reese
","In the last two years Hollywood has given us many good movies like Good night and good luck, Brokeback mountain, Syriana, King Kong , The constant gardener, Crash, Star wars, Capote etc. but no one of these movies beats Walk the line.Walk the line tells the true story about country-rock singer Johnny Cash life with such style and elegance that it make it one of my favourite movies.The movie follows Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) from he is a little boy, his first wife, his first record, his drug addiction, up to his marriage with singer and comedian June Carter (Reese Witherspoon).The movie features INCREDIBLE performances by Joaquin and Reese. They also sing the songs too. Joaquin does a really good job of portraiting Johnny Cash. But it is Reese that steals the show in this movie. She's not just beautiful, she really outdo herself in this movie. Ginnifer Goodwin, Robert Patrick, Dallas Roberts, Dan John Miller, Larry Bagby and Shelby Lynne also does good acting.The movie is directed by James Mangold, the man behind Girl, interrupted and Identity. James does a really good job of putting Johnny's life to the big screen.The script is also good. With good dialog and good story.I recommend this movie for everyone that likes good movies.",10,2,4,13 August 2006
United 93," Deticated to the people that died
","The movie tells the story about what happened on September 11. 2001 when four airplanes got high-jacked. Three of the airplanes reached their goal, except one. And that was flight United 93. The movie follows flight United 93 from it takes of to it's terrible ending. At the same time we see what happened to the other airplanes.Paul Greengrass directed and wrote screenplay to the movie very well. Instead of using known actors, Paul used actors that was not very known. That made it more realistic. And another thing Paul did was to film the movie with almost only hand-held camera, to help the realism of the movie. The actors in the movie are not very known, but they still does a good job. Every actor in this movie are good.The movie is intense, heart-wrecking, powerful, and important movie. And the few minutes is so intense that it will make you lean back to your seat and make you speechless.This is this years most important movie. And of the best movies made this year also.Everyone shud see this movie because it shows that we do not live in a perfect world.Deticated to all the people that died that day.",10,1,3,21 August 2006
Spider-Man 2," Better then the first
","Spider-man 1 was good, but this was much better. It had better special effects, visual effects, action and story. It even had more romance. Sam Raimi deliver us one of the best movies in 2004. In this movie Parker have problem being Spider-man an at the same time be a normal person. He get always fired because he is always late to work, he's grades on school gets weaker and he got love problems with Mary Jane Watson. Now he wonder if he really want to be Spider-man or not, and then finally quit as Spider-man. But when a scientist named octavius becomes deformed with tentacles attached to his back, and becomes Dr. Octopuss (Doc Och). Then Peter is forced to be Spider-man to save the world from Dr. Octopuss.",9,0,0,17 August 2006
Silent Hill," Good game adaption
","The story is very simple. a girl sleepwalks and talks about a place named Silent hill in her dreams. One night when she sleepwalk, she almost fell down a high cliff, until her mother saves her. Then the mother decides to take her daughter to Silent hill once and for all after doctors and medicines haven't succeeded of helping her. They leave soon after without her husband knowing anything. When their almost there, a girl suddenly come in front of the car, and they crash. Few hours later the mother wakes up, and the daughter is vanished. Then she walks into Silent hill looking for her daughter. At the same time her husband tries to find out what have happened in Silent Hill.The movie is adapted from the game with the same name. This is probably the best game adaption ever. It's much better than movies like Resident evil apocalypse and Doom that had worse story and was not very interesting.The movie featured not great but watchable CGI-work. Many of the CGI created creatures was cool. Specially the tree head monster. The set-design is great. Every street, building and the rooms in the houses where very good put together. The movie have a very creepy feeling while you watch it. The mood in the lightning and how the monsters walk makes it scary for some and compelling for others. The movie also features a lot of blood and gore throughout the movie.The actors in the movie does a good job. Specially Radha Mitchell as the desperate mother looking for her daughter. She was much better her then she was in the bad ''Deep Blue Sea''. But Sean Bean that is good actor, i thing didn't do as good job as Radha.But the movie is not perfect. the story is very simple (not as bad as Doom), how the mother reacts at the beginning of the movie when she speed-drives from the police with her daughter in the seat next to her (a normal person would never do this), is bad scripting. It looks like the screenwriter rush through just to come to Silent Hill as soon as possible. But still the movie was very entertaining, and has a lot of gore and bloody scenes that will enjoy horror and game fans.Welcome to Silent Hill",6,0,1,26 August 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," Not scary, only bloody and gory
","I haven't seen the original but this is just bad. The actors aren't bad, but it is the gory and bloody scenes that makes it bad. The ''monsters'' in this movie is just ridicules. You don't even get frighten by them. Every time i saw them i began laughing.Wes Craven didn't direct this time, he left that job to Alexandre Aja. Instead he wrote and produced the movie.You should never watch this movie because it is really bad. Horror movies like The sixth sense, Scream, The grudge and The amityville horror is much, much better.It's not the worst horror ever made, but is still very bad.I recommend this movie for those who loves bad movies.",5,1,2,13 August 2006
Spider-Man," Sam Raimi at his best
","Spider-man is an adaption by the comic-book series by Stan Lee.Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco and Willem Dafoe stars in this magnificent movie by Sam Raimi.The movie is about a young student named Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) who is a very shy, awkward person and not very lucky with the girls. One day when the class is on a school expedition, Peter gets bitten by a mutated spider. The morning after Peter wakes up with having superhuman strength, fast reflexes, etc. Peter soon begin using his powers to make money, but when his uncle gets killed by a criminal, Peter then swears to kill criminals as spider-man. At the same time a scientist named Norman Osbourn (Willem Dafoe)develops super-strength after he gets exposure by experimental nerve gas. Norman becomes spider-man's biggest enemy Green Goblin. The movie is directed well by Sam Raimi (Evil dead 1 and 2). The script is also very well written by David Koepp (Secret window, Jurassic park). The movie features some very good action and funny sequences. It also have some very good CGI-effects.I recommend this movie for all action fans.",8,0,1,9 August 2006
Signs," A unique movie
","M. Night Shyamalan is one of my favourite directors. That because he makes his movies in an unique style. Signs is his first film after the smash-hits The sixth sense and Unbreakable. Evey movie he makes is good, and this is not a exception. The movie is about a preacher named Graham Hess who has lost his wife. He live on a farm with his two kids and his brother Meryll (Joaquin Phoenix).One morning Graham finds a massive crop circle in his back yard. Graham thinks it's jokers fooling around, but when they begin to occur all around the world, he soon finds out that the planet are been invaded by aliens. Night focus more on the scares and suspense rather on the action. And thats not a bad thing. Everything in this movie is perfect. The soundtrack is beautifully composed by James Newton Howard (King Kong, The village). M. Night Shyamalan produced, directed, starred and wrote this peace of art. Signs is truly a work of art, and i recommend it for those who are a big Shyamalan fan or just love good movies.",9,4,9,8 August 2006
