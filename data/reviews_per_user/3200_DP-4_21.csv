Ali," Good and Bad
","They call Ali the greatest fighter in the history of professional boxing. Even more, he's admired as one of the top 2-3 athletes of the 20th century. When one goes to see a movie entitled 'Ali', one expects to walk out of the theater with a clearer understanding of why Ali deserves such accolades. Unfortunately, this movie does not come close to providing such an understanding. If I were not an Ali fan, I would have left the theatre saying 'so what?' Why do people think he was great? What was so special about the Ali that this film portrayed? He was no more than a loud mouth boxer who won a couple of big fights and constantly cheated on his wife. If this film did truly capture the essential Ali, then Ali could not have been the greatest. Of course, Ali was the greatest. That's why this film is a failure.
Yet, Will Smith does a superb job as Ali. He moves like Ali, talks like Ali and gives an excellent overall performance. The supporting cast were also fantastic. The problem is that they were given a somewhat boring rendition of Ali's life to portray, and were hampered by poor directing. It's a real shame because given a more insightful and interesting script Will could have easily made this one of the top 2-3 films of the year.This film would have been better suited for TV than the big screen. It would have made a better mini-series or single season drama than a movie. Michael Mann was out of his league and his element with this one.
Overall, the movie is worth seeing if you are an Ali fan. Otherwise, you may not understand various parts of the film, and are better off renting the ESPN Sports Century classic on Ali. It does a much better job than Mann does.-- DP.",7,0,0,29 December 2001
Training Day," Wow.
","First off, Training Day should have been rated NC-17. I was not prepared for the violence, language or subject matter of this movie. That said, this movie blew me away. If there was ever any question of Denzel's acting ability, the question is now definitely answered. Denzel was simply brilliant in this role.Training Day is about a young cop who wants to join an elite drug-fighting task force in the worst way. But before he joins he has to prove himself to the task force leader, Denzel. Unfortunately, Denzel has been is the drug war for too long, and has gotten himself into some trouble. Denzel then uses the young cop to help get him out of trouble.Honestly, the plot is not what impressed me with this film. In fact, I found the plot to be disturbing. But, Washington's performance was the best I've seen in a cop film in many, many years. So, while I can't recommend the film due to its hardcore content, I must admit that Denzel delivers in a big way. He is truly one of the elite actors in movies today.",9,1,12,28 October 2001
The Others," Good film, but too slow!
","I must admit that I had not even heard of this film until my wife mentioned it. We only went to see it because of the high IMDB rating. I have mixed emotions about this film. It was most obviously inspired by the Sixth Sense, although it does offer a different spin on that theme. The acting was fantastic. I did not know Kidman was that good. The supporting cast was also equally as excellent, as was the directing of the film.But, this movie is sooooooooooo slow! You are left constantly, constantly waiting for something to happen, but get nothing until the last 20 minutes of the film. I found myself frustrated, and just wanted the end to come so that the movie would make sense. Fortunately, the movie does explain itself, but the explanation did not totally make up for the time it took to get to the punch line. That said, I would still recommend this film. The acting is so good that it merits viewership. Besides, the Sixth Sense was so phenomenal that we have to expect people to copy from it. Imitation is, after all, the highest form of flattery.-- DP.",7,0,1,18 August 2001
Troy," Much Better than Expected
","If you are an Iliad purest and are looking for a film that directly maps to the original story then avoid this film. If you are looking for a great movie 'based on' the Iliad with an engaging storyline then see this film.This movie centers on Achilles and his quest for immortality. It also blends in human selfishness, lust, greed, power, loyalty and love into the story line in a fairly consistent manner. Brad Pitt delivered a great performance and looked every bit the part of the character. The other actors and actresses delivered equally solid performances, although the actor depicting Paris was marginal at best.Overall, this is a pretty good movie and definitely worth seeing.-- DP.",Null,0,1,24 June 2004
Taxi Driver," Over-rated, But Still Good
","I have read the comments on why so many people find this so 'incredible'. I must say upfront that I only find this film to be good, not great. Moreover, it is not a film that I'd watch over and over again like so many others. Frankly, it is vile, disturbing and odd in several ways.Yes, De Niro did a brilliant job showing us a character who slips into unto utter, murderous lunacy. Yes, the musical score was well done. That's about it for greatness though. The graphic depiction of child prostitution was over-done for my taste, as was the violence at the end. As for the end of the movie, that was simply weird.I guess the commentary on how people can feel so isolated in a large city was interesting. But, this movie simply did not move me in the manner in which others were. I walked away pretty unimpressed. 6/10 stars and without De Niro it would be lower.",5,2,6,21 January 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Well Worth It
","AOTC was a solid installment to the Star Wars series. The movie was very entertaining, and was certainly worthy to be part of the Star Wars family. It is filled with action, a solid story line, beautifully done graphics and a bit of humor.If you are looking for answers, you will find them in this movie. We begin seeing the circumstances that lead to later episodes, and get a better understanding of Darth Vader, Storm Troopers and Yoda among other key themes. I actually thought the movie could have been a bit longer, and should have explored the details of the story and characters much more. I thought the 2 hours went by fairly quickly.About the only disappointing thing to me was the acting. The 2 main characters (Obi and Anachin) are not very good actors. I was particularly disappointed in Christensen (Anachin). His lack of acting ability was apparent, and I was left scratching my head on how he ended up with such a key role. Outside of the 'B Team' actors, the movie was very good. It is well worth the price of admission, and it was great to finally see Master Yoda show his Jedi prowess. -- DP.",6,0,0,19 May 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," Not Bad At All
","If you want to enjoy this film then just reach back to the Matrix Part I and take Morpheus' advice ... free your mind. Do not take the film too seriously or look for plot flaws or look for deeper meaning in the script. If you do then you will be disappointed. Just sit back, lighten up and take this movie for what it is. It is a celebration of the SFX genius of the trilogy's makers, and an over-the-top ending to the trilogy ... though apparently not an ending to the Matrix franchise.The SFX were the most impressive I have ever seen including the first film. They were simply brilliant. The plot was somewhat engaging, and many of the questions from the second film were answered. The film moves along pretty quickly, although it does intentionally slow down at several points.
Overall, this was much, much better than Part II, which I found confusing and inappropriate at times (too much bumping and grinding for a franchise this popular). This saved the series for me and solidified it as a franchise that has cemented its place in SFX history. -- DP.",8,3,6,12 November 2003
Cast Away," Only Hanks Could Have Pulled This Off
","There's not much dialogue, monologue, action sequences, special effects, explosions, grand musical scores, breath-taking scenes or the other stuff that usually stick in our minds. It's just Tom stranded on an island with no one to talk to and nothing to do.That Tom could take this movie and totally keep my interest and thoroughly entertain me was incredible. For that Tom deserves major kudos and this film deserves its high praise. It's a great drama that explores the experience of living in total isolation and the human desire to live and our need for companionship.-- DP.",8,0,0,30 December 2000
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Good, But Not as Good as T2
","T3 is a solid final installment (or so we think) of the Terminator series. The plot pretty much works, the action is consistent throughout the movie and the ending was actually pretty good as well.The acting was generally weak. Casting for this film, outside of the 2 Terminators, was not done well. However, Arnold somewhat makes up for the weak acting by providing some rather comical one-liners throughout the movie that bring a smile to your face. Kristanna Loken also does a great job as the 2nd Terminator. She was every bit as good as Robert Patrick in T2, and he was a hard act to follow.Overall, T2 was the best of the 3 movies, not T3. There is nothing ground breaking in T3. However, T3 is an enjoyable movie with a decent story line and a lot of fun/action throughout the film. It is a must-see for true Terminator fans, and it is a respectable way to say goodbye to this story. (7/10).",5,0,0,2 July 2003
Legends of the Fall," I Don't Know Why, But I Love This Film
","I had no idea what this movie was about before watching it. I instantly fell in love with this film. I'm still not sure what it was about. Perhaps it was meant to capture the spirit of early, western American culture. Perhaps its about the beloved main character Triston and how he destroys everything he touches. Perhaps its just about life and the consequences of its decisions. Maybe all of this, or none of this.For whatever reason, I love this movie. I love its melodrama, its sadness, the love, the pain, the sibling rivalry, the commentary on life. Its sappy, and in many ways overdone. In some ways its dark, and is not for people who like happy endings or tightly knitted cohesion in a story line.
So, I am not sure why I love this film so much. But, I do. I feel like we all know Triston. A man who never finds peace even after a lifetime of desperately searching. No peace, no joy, no fair. For some that's life.",8,7,11,1 August 2002
28 Days Later...," Not Bad, Not Great
",This is a movie about a highly contagious virus that evokes a sense of uncontrollable rage in its victims causing them to kill. It also explores the violence and rage that is within all people as well as the will to survive.I liked the zombies. The makeup and directing of the zombies was fun for a while. I also liked the exploration of the difference between the zombies and the military men. That was also fun for a while.The movie moves along fairly quickly and is generally well done. I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to horror/gore fans looking for a good zombie flick. 7/10.-- DP.,6,0,1,30 November 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Good, Maybe Great but not a 10!
","Looks like I am in the minority, but this movie did not move me the way it did others. First, I would have like to have waited for the 'voice over' version. This movie was very visual, but when you have to read subtitles you miss out on much of the visual effect. Second, the story line is not that original. It's an adolescent with massive potential but no direction who ultimately finds herself after causing a horrible tragedy. She just happens to know Kung Fu instead of basketball, football or some other theme that we've seen a million times.Yeah, the special effects were awesome. The acting was solid, and the script was good. But this movie is not one of the best of all times as people are saying. And, I suggest to wait for the voice-over version so that you can take in all of its visual wonder.-- DP.",10,0,0,8 February 2001
X-Men: The Last Stand," Ignore the Critics
","After reading the early reviews of 'Last Stand' I almost did not go see the movie. I am so glad that I ignored the critics on this one. The Last Stand is equal if not better than either of its predecessors. It has a great story line, great effects, funny moments and a ton of action. It also has several moments that caught me totally off guard. If you liked the previous two films SEE THIS FILM ASAP. You will love it.AND STAY TILL THE VERY END AFTER THE CREDITS. There is a reward waiting that 'might' just mean that we have not seen the last of the X-Men.D.",8,3,6,26 May 2006
I Am Legend," Will Grows as Actor + A 'Different' Zombie Movie
","In much the same way that Tom Hanks had to carry the movie 'Cast Away', Will had to do the same with this movie. In so doing, Will showed me that he has really grown as an actor over the years. That was great to see, and I believe it will open even more doors for him moving forward.Equally as wonderful was to see a VERY different zombie movie. Honestly, this movie is more about themes like the human spirit, redemption, deep loneliness, dealing with regret/loss and a surprising theme that I will leave unnamed as not to spoil it for folks. The zombie part is actually secondary, though well done and prominent throughout the movie.I had the same reaction to this movie as I did to 'The Mist'. Both are movies with familiar backdrops that we've seen a million times. However, they explore and expose a totally different element of the story. That makes them unique, and Will Smith makes this entertaining, engaging and exciting. Very well done. One of my most enjoyable movie experiences of the year. Total surprise. Can't wait to see it again in HD. There was an unexpected depth to this movie that was wonderful to see.",8,4,9,15 December 2007
Hero," Brilliant
","Before I give my review, let me offer one suggestion that will help you appreciate this film. DO NOT SEE IT JUST ONCE. Watch it twice and then pass judgment. The film is so visually and artistically captivating that the plot can be harder to grasp the first time around. The second time around you'll get a better appreciation for the film.I viewed this film with high expectations. People were comparing it with Crouching Tiger and I really enjoyed that film. Within the first 10 minutes you understand why the comparisons are made. The cinematography, editing, music and special effects are similar. The stories, however, are quite different, and I found the story to be better than the one in Crouching Tiger.The story is about an assassin who concocts a plan to kill a king who had been trying to conquer his home land in pre-unified China. His assassination plan requires him to get close enough to the king to strike him dead. The movie shows the assassin's plan through a series of flashbacks, and culminates with the assassin getting his chance to kill the king.The beauty of this film is the how the assassin becomes a 'Hero'. I won't spoil how he achieves this, but that is what made the film great for me. It made the film more than just a visual and musical masterpiece. It also made it more than just a Kung Fu picture. It actually added a decent plot to the film which made it worth while. Honestly, I was just expecting a good Kung Fu picture. Hero is actually a great overall movie which just happens to accent the film with some of the best Kung Fu action in recent years.Definitely the best movie that I have seen this year. I hope it wins big at the awards ceremonies. It was impressive.-- DP.",9,58,79,28 December 2004
Mulholland Drive," Spare Yourself!
","After seeing the high IMDB rating this got, we rushed out to see what inspired the rave reviews. By the end of the movie, we were left thinking that either there are we are too unsophisticated to 'get' this movie, or other people's standards for a 'good' movie are very different from ours.*** POSSIBLE SPOILER: I 'think' this movie was about how some actresses deal with a total lack of success in Hollywood, among other aspects of how Hollywood is run. But, again, perhaps I am just too unsophisticated to 'get it'. In any case, the movie centers around an actress who tries to help a woman who has amnesia. The two end up becoming lesbian lovers, and work together to find out the identity of the woman with amnesia. Their journey takes a series of odd twists that I suppose were meant to be 'thought provoking'. I found them boring, painful and in some cases just plain distasteful.If you like movies like 'Danny Darko' then this film is for you. If you like movies that actually make sense, and do not require you to look through the eyes of some 'brilliant' producer who is 'way ahead of his time' then spare yourself. I hated this film, and I am extremely happy that I did not pay to see this in the movies. It was simply painful.-- DP.",3,0,2,1 June 2002
There Will Be Blood," Over-Hyped Hero Worship for the Director
","In reading a lot of the comments on this film, people constantly mention how much they loved other films from the director of this movie. Their hero worship of the director has obviously skewed their assessment of this film. The movie was too long, had an annoying musical score and was just OK.The movie is about a lonely, shrewd, relentless, power-driven man who finds success in oil in the late 1800s to early 1900s. The movie really centers on how greed rots this man to the core and ultimately denigrates his character to a pathetic, sinister state of being. It also explores how folks use money and power to fill certain voids in their life that are meant to be filled with family, friendship and intimate connection with others.The movie has other characters in it like his son, a young small-town religious zealot and a few others. But clearly the 'oil man' is the main character.If you like long, dark movies that leave you wondering, then perhaps you too will think this was a masterpiece. Personally, I found this movie only moderately intriguing. It was well acted, but the directing was just OK as was the script. 6/10 stars at best, and a 4/10 for the musical score since I found it annoying and distracting. I like it when the score draws me into the movie, not when it draws attention to itself that draws me out of it.",5,1,3,11 July 2008
Vanilla Sky," I'd Prefer Chocolate Dirt
","Vanilla Sky is a movie about young man who inherits a ton of money and a powerful company from his late father. He has it all, or so it seems, until a freak accident takes away his health. He then makes a series of decisions that oddly shape the remainder of his long life.Now that you know the plot, save yourself the pain of watching this movie. The problem is that the character portrayed by Tom Cruise is simply not very interesting, nor is the story itself. You are taken from one odd scene in this man's 'life' to the next, and you anxiously await the end of the movie for an explanation of how it all fits together. Once you get the explanation you say to yourself, 'how stupid'. Stupid. That pretty much sums up the movie. You are tortured for what seems like 3 hours until the end, and then you are angry that you wasted your time. They hired a heck of a cast, and the cast performed very well. But, the story is, well, stupid. The climax of the movie is beyond stupid. Spare yourself from Vanilla Sky and have some Vanilla ice cream instead. You will enjoy it much, much more.-- DP.",5,0,0,31 May 2002
Identity," Well Done!
","If you are looking for a suspense thriller that is pretty hard to figure out and keeps you guessing to the end then see this film. 9 out of 10 'whodunit' films are pretty easy to figure out. This one fooled me, and I found the film to be very well done.The story is about 10 strangers who end up stranded at a hotel during a violent storm. One by one they begin to die, and one of them is the killer. But who is it, and better yet why? It was well worth the price of a pay-per-view, and was one of the best thrillers of the year. 8 out of 10.-- DP.",8,0,0,4 October 2003
Braveheart," Wow!
","His name was William Wallace. He was a passivist, and simply wanted to live a peaceful life with his wife in the hillsides of Scotland. After his wife is tragically murdered by English soldiers, Wallace is compelled to not let his wife's murder be in vain.Mel Gibson, in his finest hour, brings this true story to life in one of the greatest films of the 90's. If you are looking for the perfect blend of powerful acting, superb directing, a great story line, intrigue, drama, romance and action then rent Braveheart. It is perhaps the greatest movie on war and liberation ever made.",10,3,6,16 December 2000
Donnie Darko," What a Bust!
","Let me say up front...do NOT waste your time or money seeing this film. It was extremely disappointing and very non-interesting. Donnie Darko is a teenager who is struggling with mental problems. He is heavily medicated, however his mental illness is getting the best of him. So, he begins performing acts of violence and vandalism.The main character, Donnie, is then surrounded by a subplot based on time travel. The subplot makes almost no sense and totally confuses the movie. The movie ends up be very odd, extremely boring and generally incohesive. I suspect the ending of the movie is supposed to explain the other boring 2 hours, but to me it just made the film even more painful to bear. Could it be possible that Donnie Psycho can actually travel back in time and alter the past? Give me a break! And to the film makers...how about less cheesy special effects and better quality sound editing.4/10 at best. Donnie Darko was a total disappointment at almost all levels. I suspect its makers think they were being clever with this movie. If so, they are too clever for their own good, and for the good of anyone who hoped this movie had more to offer.",1,23,52,28 October 2001
