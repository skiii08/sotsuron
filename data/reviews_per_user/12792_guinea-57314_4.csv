Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Wasn't perfect but people don't give the prequels credit.
","I don't know why these movies, episodes 1-3 get so much hate. I understand it had problems. Some cheesy lines, sure... some parts with questionable acting.. Ok... these problems are nothing new to Star Wars... The original acting wouldn't have won any drama awards... but thats part of the charm of star wars.. The biggest problem with this movie was that George went ham on the CGI effects... and JAJA Binks was a little too much. 
 
 With that aside, there were a lot of GREAT things about these movies people seem to over look. I think in time these movies will get more respect gradually.. There were a lot of memorable scenes, innovative ideas and great acting.. Liam Neeson, McGreggor, the Emperor... all did a fantastic job. Some of the battle scenes and music were epic.. Even when the movie felt childish... they still knew how to create evil characters and dark scenes.. Darth Maul was way darker and cooler than the space balls character from force awakens. There were a lot of memorable things about all three of these movies.. They still had the magic touch of the original and were enjoyable to watch. I liked all three of these prequels more than I did watching the Force Awakens..",8,2,4,26 January 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Force Awakens shouldn't have a higher score than this movie..
","All I can say is that out of all the new Disney movies I have seen thus far, (solo, VII VIII and rogue 1) this was the best of them. This and The Mandalorian show are the best things to come out of Disney thus far. The fact that the Force Awakens has a better score than this movie is a testament to the mental capacity of our society. I don't feel like writing a long-winded review as most people do on here. The movie is well done and was a great prelude into the original Starwars trilogy. It had a good story, suspense a lot of action, great battle scenes and a compelling climax that leads perfectly into episode IV.. Including past characters from the old Trilogy throughout the movie was also a nice touch.. This was simply about a good story and movie without all the other crap.. The only progressive part they stuffed into this one was to make the radical rebels resemble Muslim Freedom fighters, but other than that it was just focused on the story..
In summary this was a more riveting and serious take on Starwars that felt authentic, yet less juvenile. ...Force Awakens in contrast had a very teen 'Disney' feel throughout the movie with a cast you would expect from Disney..If our society made sense, the ratings would be similar to
Force awakens mid 6's
Last Jedi 5-6
Rogue one 8-9+
Solo 7",10,4,5,9 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Wish George was back.
","Say what you want about the prequels... keep hating on them but to me they were better than these new releases by Disney with the exception of rogue 1... Both VII and now VIII just lost touch with the whole feel of what star was was about... The prequels even despite the criticisms maintained that feel of what a star wars movie should be.. I can't put it into words, but the last six done by George Lucas still had that magic touch.. Its a flow, its the way the movie unfolds.. its the type of battles and when.. It was the selection of key character that made the movie. No matter how much action they put in, or what they try to do, it just feels like star wars is falling apart and dying.. The best part of this movie was when r2d2 played the old clip of princess leia asking Obi Won for help..  The characters, the plot.. it just feels all over the place. It's not concise, its not crisp.. the new emperor sucked, the new 'darth vader' isn't my cup of tea.. The ruling general feels more like a joke. . The old emperor, darth maul and even count duku were better villains.. I think people are slowly going to realize that they shouldn't have hated on the prequels so damn much... i wish George continued to make the last three.. I would leave rogue one tho.. that one was good. Not a fan of the plot much.. not a fan of the flow of the movie, and not a fan of the character selection.. RIP Star Wars... Episodes I-VI and rogue one are the last true star wars movies in my eyes.",6,1,1,28 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," 7 but still my least favorite
","I have to be honest with myself. For some reason when I watched this movie it felt like there was something missing. The prequels to the original get so much constant hate and criticism and no one points out the positive things about those movies.. .. I actually enjoyed watching those movies more than this one despite some cheesy lines, over use of CGI and annoying characters like JaJa.. 
 I feel this way because episodes 1-3 still had that magic touch.. I don't know what it is but it still maintained a certain type of feel and flow of the original movies. It had things about those movies that were very memorable, original, yet still felt familiar.. That is what I feel was lacking in this one. There was nothing about it that really stood out.. It tried to be Star Wars so hard, but it failed. It just felt like 'someone else' was trying to copy and remake the Star Wars theme.. None of the characters were memorable.. None of the fight scenes were really memorable.. Each one of the Star Wars movies before it had something that really stood out . I could watch all six of the Star Wars movies over again .... But this one I feel like after watching it once.. I don't really care if I see it again. Even Harrison Ford didn't look into it. It was like someone dragged him out of bed and forced him to do this movie.. His acting was very lack luster.  There was no imagination in this movie but simply a rehash without the same flow and rhythm of the other six.. 
Here's what stands out for me. . 
Ep 1 - Darth maul.. 10x better of a character.. the one in force awakens felt more like watching a space balls villain .... Pod racing.. That really stood out.. The music and fight scenes with darth maul... Awesome acting by liam Neeson and McGreggor.. Ep2- The clone wars battle scene was a pretty epic battle and very memorable. Seeing yoda younger and actually fighting was memorable even if it was funny to watch. A lot of memorable acting and synergy between Anakin and Obi Wan.. Ep3- was dark, told the story that lead up to the originals... The final battle was very memorable.. the ending stood in my mind for awhile... The Emperors acting was on point.. Force awakens- The best thing i liked about it really was the new droid.. Oh and if you want to count a progressive approach having a woman and black guy be the main characters.. but I don't really care about any of that.  My score... originals were my favorite. followed by rogue one and the prequels.. Force Awakens was the least enjoyable to watch for me.",6,0,5,26 January 2018
