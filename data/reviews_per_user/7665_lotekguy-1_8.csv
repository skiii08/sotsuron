Marie Antoinette," plenty for the eyes; not much for the head or heart
","Kirsten Dunst stars as one of history's most infamous aristocrats in a splendid-looking, tediously dull account of her life from the arranged marriage to France's heir apparent (Jason Schwartzman. Really. No kidding. Him), through their ascent to the throne and the start of La Revolution.The script presents Marie rather sympathetically. Leaving her Austrian home behind to forge an alliance by marrying another teenager is purely a matter of duty. Louis, poised to become #XVI, is a complete nerd, and possibly gay. Her mission is to do whatever it takes to bear a child, since the union, and its vital political benefits, isn't a done-deal until a royal baby pops out. Heavy pressure.Director Sofia Coppola was obviously granted a budget for costumes and sets more lavish than the palace's legendary excesses. Too bad no one had the clout to shift a few of those dollars or euros to the writing fund. She gets sole screenplay credit, and therefore deserves the blame. The cast (notably including Rip Torn's raunchy Louis XV and Judy Davis) and premise were in place for a witty, racy view of the players and their fate. Versailles was cleverly dissed a few years ago in 'Ridicule'. Had they opted for more dramatic psychological tension, Willem Dafoe's 'The Night and the Moment' would have served as a model. At the very least, they could have tweaked the nudity and debauchery up to R-rating levels for some cheap thrills. The only novelty is showing the absurd formalities and protocols in every mundane daily function; for Marie, simply rising from her bed in the morning entailed a rigidly-orchestrated ceremony - a far cry from being satisfied with 'Folger's in your cup' as the bests part of waking up.Coppola tantalizes with anachronistic rock tunes over the credits and again later in the film, but to no avail. That gimmick worked delightfully in 'A Knight's Tale', when the action and tongue-in-cheek story meshed with the music (who didn't go nuts along with that medieval jousting crowd getting pumped for the battle by 'We will, we will rock you!!'). But Coppola, perhaps seduced by the opportunity to shoot her film at Versailles, chose to dote on shoes, clothes, jewelry, furnishings and pastries - essentially all the pomp of Marie's circumstance - like one of those voyeuristic TV tours of rich and famous folks' homes, with few laughs, less drama, and diminishing reasons to care about the heads beneath the wigs. After its theatrical run, it should air on one of the home-shopping programs, rather than the premium movie channels.I won't say whether they show Marie's last gasp on the guillotine; but many in the audience will have found their own heads nodding off long before the film reaches that point. I would have welcomed Mel Brooks signing off with 'it's not always good to be the king'.",3,1,4,22 October 2006
Iron Man 2," sequel drop-off, but enough to sustain hopes for #3
","Sequel drop-off is a well-known phenomenon, but it still bums us out when it occurs. Most of us only bother with extensions of films we liked, as we hope the next edition will buck the industry trend. Like Godfather 2. No such luck in Robert Downey Jr's further adventures in this superhero's supersuit.After a great early scene in which a witty, sarcastic Tony Stark triumphs over a pompous senator's (Gary Shandling) political posturing, the film drags emotionally - especially compared to the charismatic, sympathetic Stark persona introduced in the first film. Six months after the events in that one, we now find a Stark who is initially too full of himself, then anxious and morose over threats to his health and the superiority of his technology over those who would do evil in the world. Scarlett Johansson and Mickey Rourke head the new arrivals, as a surprisingly versatile assistant and arch-villain, respectively.The adrenaline rushes of battles and explosions are viscerally comparable to such scenes from the first, but lose some punch, having to overcome the long morose stretches of Stark wrestling with his issues. There's still a decent scattering of comic relief in Jon Favreau's direction of the script Justin Theroux wrote with The Master - Stan Lee. But the overall energy level is disappointing. Not enough to kill the franchise, but at least offering a cautionary tale for the brains behind an Iron Man 3 to remember what made the first one such a winner.Viewing Tip - After the interminable (as they always must be for stunt and f/x-laden fare) credits, there's a brief scene for which fans should defer their exits, allowing the less faithful first shot at the restrooms.Spoiler Alert Quiz #1 - Among a handful of familiar talking-heads doing segments in character on TV screens within the film, Bill O'Reilly delivers what his detractors would likely regard as a classic example of the bone-headed, pompous, ill-informed overreactions to the depicted events that define his Fox News persona. Is his willingness to speak those lines intentional, compulsive, clueless, or self-satirical? Spoiler Alert Quiz #2 - Sci-fi flicks, like many others, require considerable 'suspension of disbelief' for audience engagement. Which facet of this film demands the greater stretch - Scarlett Johansson kicking serious butt, or Mickey Rourke reading and working from complex sets of high-tech blueprints?",8,1,3,7 May 2010
The Devil Wears Prada," Meandering comedy falls short on the satire and the coming-of-age side
","This one plays out as glitzy attempt at one of Garry Marshall's contemporary Cinderella comedies. He struck gold with Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman, and PG'ed the hooker into a teenager when he cast another leggy ing√©nue with an engagingly over-sized smile, Anne Hathaway, in The Princess Diaries. In this adaptation of a popular novel, Hathaway stars as a bright, earnest journalism grad, yearning for her first job in Manhattan. The first big interview opportunity she gets is to become a personal assistant to the most influential (and absurdly demanding) magazine editor in the world of high fashion, underplayed flawlessly by Meryl Streep. Our girl looks like a librarian from the Midwest, and couldn't be more of a misfit among the obsessively skinny feminists, but Meryl apparently sees something under that drab surface, and hires her, anyway.For nearly two hours we see Anne's aspirations and ties to her boyfriend and old circle of pals wax and wane as they clash with her new role. Of course she starts dressing the part, with the assistance of a relatively non-snotty honcho (Stanley Tucci), who furthers the Marshall model by filling Hector Elizondo's kindly-mentor shoes. Somewhere between the fantasy of glamor and the lack of time to form her own thoughts, since she's at the mercy of Meryl's every whim on a 24/7 basis, her outer and inner beauty start heading in opposite directions. Will this job remain as her tone-year, resume-building stepping stone to writing about serious social issues, or will she be seduced by the perks of hobnobbing with the rich and famous, including the romantic interest of a successful writer (Simon Baker) who may be more suited to the evolving edition of Anne's personality? Beyond the obvious eye-candy feast inherent in this setting, the script serves up some good laughs and effective sentimental moments, though not enough for nearly two hours. Had the story been lightened and tightened into a breezy industry satire with a dollop of romantic intrigue, they wouldda been a contender. But the attempt at depth (presumably more true to the novel) requires more distance from reality than usual. Getting Julia off the streets, and seeing a gawky mid-teen Anne grow into her birthright (including a much-needed sense of self-esteem) were more intrinsically desirable than watching a bright young woman of conscience drink the Kool-Aid Streep is pouring.Early in the going, Meryl rebuts Anne's disdain for everything they stand for with a sharp diatribe about the value and pervasive influence of the designers she makes or breaks, even on those who don't realize it. For a while, that speech seems to validate their existence more than expected. It certainly causes Anne's character to shift her thinking. For anyone who doesn't rely on Cosmo and its ilk as essential reference material, the only reason those lines work is that Meryl Streep is saying them.In what kind of Bizarro world should a woman as slender and wholesomely pretty as Hathaway at the beginning be derided as too fat and frumpy? Who believes it's even possible, much less admirable, to float above all the cares and problems the rest of us live with in an endless quest for the smallest size of whatever some distant strangers decide is chic? Beauty in troubled times gives relief and hope...to a point. The Devil of this title isn't Streep's overbearing manner; it's the temptation of form over substance, mirrored by the film's ultimate lack of substance worthy of its stars. Looks great; less filling.",6,3,8,30 June 2006
Dunkirk," Anonymity of principal cast honors anonymous heroes
","The story of this massive evacuation of British and French troops back across the English Channel in 1940 has been depicted several times before, but never so intriguingly or compellingly. Writer/director Christopher Nolan pulled off what seems to be oxymoronic in crafting a powerfully understated presentation of such a famous event. The preceding military action in France was a disaster, but rescuing most of the 400,000 soldiers pinned down by all branches of the German forces allowed England to keep Hitler on the Continent until the rest of the Allies would become fully armed and engaged. Most war films focus on one or more heroes, played by stars and familiar character actors, with relatively predictable story arcs. The 1958 account of this historic achievement starred John Mills and Richard Attenborough; in 2004, Benedict Cumberbatch and Timothy Dalton headlined. This time, Kenneth Branagh is the biggest 'name', but his role is marginal. Instead, we switch among several story lines of anonymous soldiers, sailors, pilots and civilians, with few of them even being given names. We also see their fears, moments of cowardice or selfishness along with their heroism. By not knowing who is who (and, typically, who we figure will either save the day, die tragically, or both, based on decades of cinematic convention) we feel the utter randomness of which imperiled character will live or die, and whether it will happen on shore or during evacuation. British pride over the event comes largely from the way innumerable civilian boat owners, with vessels of all types and sizes, bravely responded to the call to help its over-matched Navy by crossing the channel to carry as many lads back as they could hold... if they survived the threats from enemy U-boats, bombers and fighter jets. For the troops, reaching one of the boats proved to be far from an assurance of safe passage. Nolan delivers all the sound and fury of being among their ranks, sustaining nearly two hours of the intense fear, chaos and frustrations that the actual figures must have experienced. It's among the closest approximations I can recall of the masterful D-Day landing sequence at the beginning of Saving Private Ryan. We see many fatalities from many causes, but without the explicit display of bloodshed that an R- rated production would have contained. We didn't need it to get the layers of emotional impact in that ordeal from all perspectives. The jumps from one mini-arena to another, and even repeating certain sequences from different character perspectives adds to that sense of no one in position to deduce what action or location will be safest for themselves or their comrades. The experience is grueling for the audience, and honors the soldiers most by putting us in their actual, not idealized or glorified, boots. This Dunkirk marks quite an achievement for all its creators and cast.",9,5,11,21 July 2017
Batman Begins," welcome back, batman
","After four progressively lamer features from 1989 - 97 with three different stars, and last year's Catwoman fiasco, who would have thought that a Caped-Crusader prequel would rate a blip on the radar (or sonar, for the nocturnal mammals that started it all)? Well sometimes we get pleasant surprises.Everyone who read the comics or saw any of the movies knows Bruce Wayne/Batman was shaped by the childhood trauma of his parents' death. This film gives us far more detail about those circumstances, the roots of his bat fixation, and his training to emerge as a superhero crime-fighter. I'm not sure how much of this backstory is new material, but it adds up to a fine script from David S. Goyer. About 60% of this 2 ¬Ω hour adventure leads up to Batman's debut.The guilt-ridden child is mostly raised by butler Alfred (Michael Caine, in his 'Cider House Rules' mode). He's a bitter lad, who drops out of college, and keeps a distance from his childhood pal (Katie Holmes), whose grown up to be not only a babe, but an idealistic prosecutor. Bruce disappears for seven years, living on the mean streets before getting super-ninja-type training from a secret organization of crime fighters in Asia. But they're too hard-core, so he returns to Gotham to find a less Draconian way to root out all the evil that disqualifies his city from hosting a Super Bowl or the Miss America Pageant.Christian Bale masters all the physical and emotional aspects of the dual role. In the scenes covering his relatively shaggy days, he looked so much like Tom Cruise in 'The last Samurai' that it may have been confusing for Ms. Holmes (note to self- only get snuggly with the one who's pushing Scientology). Bulking up for this role is particularly impressive, after starving himself to under 120 pounds for the cadaverous look needed for last year's lead in 'The Mechanic'. Bale must have the world's greatest dietician and trainer to manage such a radical swing.Morgan Freeman adds a nice dimension, partly by serving as the hero's counterpart to James Bond's gadgetmaster Q. Liam Neeson, Tom Wilkinson and Gary Oldman chip in some fine work. Oldman appears as a young police officer, about the only honest one left on the force, named Gordon. He might be discouraged to think of himself as aging so badly that he'll look like Pat Hingle by the time he becomes Commissioner.Director Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia) delivers a franchise-reviving tale by focusing more on character than chaos. Batman's evolution makes more sense than one might expect from a fantasy figure. There's nothing campy about the foes or the action; Cillian Murphy's villain is creepy from understatement - more James Spader than Danny DeVito. Most of the action sequences are less satisfying - too fast, too dark, too many cuts to fully follow who's doing what to whom. But the climactic battle is a marvel of big-budget, computer-generated mayhem. Overall, this film may be the best of the bunch; or maybe Ben Affleck's recent flop in 'Daredevil' lowered the bar even further. Either way, the running time passed quickly, and the dangled sequel hook at the end looks tempting.",7,0,1,15 June 2005
Avengers: Infinity War," Big budget, big cast, big bang for the buck - lives up to its hype
","Since everyone likely to watch this has already seen plenty of Marvel Comics' superhero movies, let's keep this one simple, with a good news-bad news format:Good - More superheroes appear in this one than you could shake Thor's hammer at. 
Bad - It's occasionally hard to keep track of who is using which power against which enemy or henchperson thereof. Bad - It runs 2 ¬Ω hours. Good - The action is so (dare I say?) fast and furious that it sure seems a lot shorter. Bad - After all that time, the movie ends with a lousy situation, including some surprising deaths, just to set up a sequel.
Good - Since the power to control time is one of the themes, maybe the sequel will undo some of the losses we witnessed in this one. Good - Stan Lee's cameo comes early, allowing focus to remain on the main story. Bad - What could possibly be bad about a Stan Lee cameo? They're always nothing but degrees of good. Good - Josh Brolin looks and sounds suitably menacing in the role of archvillain Thanos, while also showing more emotional layers than usual for the genre. Bad - The handsome Brolin, in full regalia, bears a shocking resemblance to Ron Perlman, which would be a serious loss of points on the old 1-10 scale if carried over to his real life. Good - Wonderful comic touches from Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man/Tony Stark and the crew from Guardians of the Galaxy. 
Bad - Much of the action occurs in such dark, ominous settings, creating the impression of DC Comics having invaded this universe. Even Darth Vader would have wanted to redecorate Thanos' spacecraft and environs top cheer the place up. Bad - Dave Bautista's endearingly dense Drax is getting even dumber. Good - At least his form of stupidity is funny, unlike the same trend in the US Congress. Good - Thanos' evil plot is to save all the planets in the universe that have become overpopulated by wiping out half of their populations in a single stroke. Since he offs them randomly, he thinks it's fair, making him the ultimate eco-warrior. Bad - See previous comment about US Congress, whose collective thinking is no better. Good - Scarlett Johansson appears as Black Widow. Bad - She doesn't get enough screen time to display her lithe and lethal skill set to full advantage. Actually, the same pairing applies to lovable tree-creature Groot, but for very different reasons Bad - The credits are really, really long. Good - The standard teaser after they finally roll past is worth the wait. Good - Franchise fans (who, unlike me at the time, already know this isn't a one-and-done story line) should be delighted by the script and the overall quality of the production, including all the CGI vistas and mayhem. Go to the biggest screen and most enveloping sound system in driving range, since there's plenty of action worthy of those enhancements. 
Bad - If you've not already seen a fair share of the zillion movies or read a bunch of the decades of comics featuring Thor, Spiderman, Iron Man and all the other characters converging to defeat this epic threat to the universe, don't start here. You'll be a stranger in a strange land. In space, no one can hear you bond.",8,1,3,26 April 2018
The Bourne Legacy," needs less chatter, more splatter
","The good news is that there's another sequel in the exciting hit espionage series that starred Matt Damon as the superspy who didn't know he was one, based on widely-read novels by genre master Robert Ludlum. The bad news is that neither the author nor the star had anything to do with this production. Instead we get Jeremy Renner as the next generation of chemically-enhanced operatives after Mr. Bourne, working from a story written and directed by Tony Gilroy. Based on this evidence, it's hard to believe Gilroy adapted the first three novels into such successful screenplays, since this spin off is, above all else, so dull.The hush-hush program our intelligence services devised to create agents like Bourne is under fire, with leaks about its sordid activities about to cause a storm of backlash. The honchos scramble to destroy all evidence of what they did and how they did it, including silencing the unveilers with, as they supposedly say in the biz, extreme prejudice. Renner is the one who gets away, threatening international disgrace, and a whole bunch of careers. Those with power rarely give it up willingly. So Renner's on the run through a globe-trotting series of action scenes that never manage to add up to the thrillfest we've come to expect from this franchise.The first hour is confusing, with so many players briefly shown in so many parts of the world, and far too much dialog for the amount of action. Renner is even stiffer than usual. Some of that is consistent with his character's training, but it still makes a less compelling bond with viewers than the norm for heroes in such flicks. Gilroy is also wanting as a director (his first high-octane venture, after the relatively cerebral Duplicity and Michael Clayton), deriving less payoff in the chases and fights than he should have wrung from the budget and assets on his sets. Among the big summer action epics thus far, this one ranks as the most disappointing.",4,4,13,9 August 2012
Lucy," Looks Great, Less Filling
","I'm a big fan of both writer/director Luc Besson (The Transporter and Taken series, among the lengthy action credentials he's racked up since La Femme Nikita) and his star, Scarlett Johansson. Alas, the two have collaborated on a movie that's truly cool and exciting until it descends into stupidity. Besson's directing significantly out-paces his writing in this one.The premise is familiar axiomatic science. Humans only use about 10% of our brain capacity, leaving zillions of neural pathways, with all their unknown potential capabilities, in storage. What if we could use more, or even all of it? What information and collective memories might we access? What physical and mental powers might emerge - perhaps ranging somewhere between superhero and deity? Those prospects are particularly relevant, since Johansson has played the former, and co-star Morgan Freeman the latter in better movies.Johansson's character is a college student dating the wrong guy in Taipei. Gangsters force her into serving as a mule for a new designer drug they'll sell in Europe. When the package they plant in her belly bursts, it expands her mind to the max. Payback and other deployments of these enhancements before the drug overwhelms her drive the plot and its hectic pace. Several sequences show Besson at his best, including one in which Johansson drives through Paris like another Jason Statham.As to the rest, there are two possibilities. Either Besson didn't know how to get his cast out of the situation he created, settling for a jumble of splashy, acid-trip array of computer effects that fail to sync with his title character. Or the upper limit of my 10% is so far below his that I've missed the point and should have given this a higher rating. If you go, the call is yours.",4,10,27,29 July 2014
