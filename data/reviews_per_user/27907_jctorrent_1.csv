The Hangover," Watched it with 2 uptight Christian schoolgirls
","I lived in Vegas when this was made. I was set-up; by my friend no less. The double-date from hell. I thought it was going to be a total disaster: a dirty, raunchy movie, that wasn't going to be funny; and make me look like a jack-ass with my uptight (first) date. The girls looked like they were ready to bolt for the door.The girls started laughing first. It redeemed it self almost immediately, and just got better.It's possible that we had a bias towards liking it , since we lived there, and had seen things happen there; like the guy who robbed the liquor store naked, then went and hijacked a city bus with all it's passengers, still naked, then got in a high speed chase with the cops and was finally arrested live on TV. So yeah, that's typical Vegas for us. The movie felt so much like home for us, we couldn't help but like it.If you have caviar tastes, this is not the movie for you. For the rest of us, it's money well spent.",9,1,4,9 June 2011
