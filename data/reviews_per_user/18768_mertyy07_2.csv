Ford v Ferrari," Just one of 250 movies that must be watched before she dies
","Since it's a biography movie, most people know what happened in the end.But for those who don't know, I don't want to break the surprise.First of all, the lead actors Matt Damon and Christian Bale have performed tremendously.I enjoyed watching the competition of Ford and Ferrari companies in the mid-sixties.I can say that I enjoyed more of the Lakers match I watched in the race scenes.Christian Bale lost 30 kilos for this movie.It should be appreciated.The voices in the movie are very good. He has already received an academy award in the field of sound design.One of the top 10 Hollywood productions released in 2019.",9,3,4,24 April 2020
1917," Like a single plan but not
","The subject of the 1917 movie briefly describes how two English soldiers send messages from one place to another.I really like the camera angles of the movie. The movie looks like a single shot, but not a single shot.The feeling of tension in the movie feels as if something can happen at any moment.They modeled most sets and decided in advance how cameras and actors would act.They planned everything one by one before the shooting and did not even include a single mistake during the shooting.All the places you see in the movie are really made, they opened trenches about 1.5 kilometers long.They shot the trench scenes only in daylight.Since the sun created a very harsh atmosphere, most of the day they waited for the sun to come and a shady air to come.Roger Deakins has done a really good job.You should definitely watch this movie.",9,0,2,24 April 2020
