Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Insulted Movie for the Bulagarian nation
","How it could be possible to make movie without check something about the nations, which life you describe. This movie is really out of comments, bad tasteful and not reliable. I was laughing at the stupid scenes before I heard a typical song for the Bulgarian folklore. Before the 'amazIng' producers of the movie get the awards for this 'brilliant movie' please let them read books or go to Bulgaria. Because we are not gypsies. All songs in the film are typical Gypsy songs except one in the moment when Borat forgive his friend. It is too rude to put Bulgarian song in cheap movie like Borat and with the thought it is Gypsy. If the producers reach this comment please apologize officially to Bulgarian nation and cut the song from your boorish movie.",1,4,10,23 February 2007
