The Blair Witch Project," Over-rated, a disappointment!!!
","I had high hopes for this film and was happy that the effort was being made to scare us without state of the art effects and lots of blood, but was bitterly disappointed when I went to see the final result.  What ruined it for me was the way the actors lost it so easily and their utter stupidity throughout - Imagine throwing the map away!!!  Only in America!!!  What was the ending all about anyway?  I would love to see a British remake......",2,0,2,25 February 2000
Predator," Arnie's best film and a creature that rivals only Giger's Alien in utter coolness!!!
","Whatever may be said about the weak plot, this film is a winner!!!  Arnie is at his one-line spitting best, his group of commandos are just his style, the setting is effective in generating an uncomfortable feeling, explosions and mutilated bodies by the truckload and well....the Predator should have a show of his own!!!  Keeping the Predator out of view until nearer the end helps build the suspense but the showdown between him and Arnie is celebrity deathmatch material!!!  One of those films you watch and say 'they don't come up with original ideas like that any more!'  'Stick around!!!'",8,1,2,25 February 2000
Aliens," Everything we loved about the original, multiplied by 1,000!!!
","An adrenaline rush from start to finish!  More xenomorphs, more firepower, more Ripley, more chest-bursting-flamethrowing-heartpounding-action, why oh why couldn't the following two films have done the same?  The many sub-plots and relationships between characters, Ripley & Burke, Ripley & Hicks, Ripley & Bishop, the colonists, Gorman and Vasquez etc.. were all interwoven perfectly and dissolved at the right moments when surviving the terror became of paramount importance!  Scary, exciting, funny, superb plot, guns, violence, human drama, and it expands on the original without taking too much away - everything you want from a sci-fi sequel!!!",10,0,2,25 February 2000
