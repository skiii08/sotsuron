Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A worthy addition to the series
","What most people failed to realize was that this movie's main function was to introduce the characters and set up the situations that will factor into the story and lead into the next film. You don't really know the characters that well after only reading the first few chapters in a book, do you? This is a worthy addition to the series, and a gift to the fans. Most of these critics couldn't even figure out what the *phantom menace* was. And to all who say the acting was horrid, do these people not remember Mark Hammil? Carrie Fisher?? Star Wars has never been, nor will it ever be about great acting, it's about the high-flying exuberance of the whole package. If you still haven't figured this out by now then you weren't a Star Wars fan to begin with, so please do us fans a favor and skip the next film so there'll be more seats for us. Thanks, have a nice day.",1,0,1,11 June 2000
Alien: Resurrection," Underrated!
","Alien:Resurrection is the most underrated Alien movie in the series. It's far better than the junk called Aliens and Alien 3. NOT as good as ALIEN, but its not that far behind. It is without a doubt the BEST Alien movie in terms of visuals, and I don't mean effects.",Null,0,0,30 March 2000
Fargo," The Coens' Best
","This is without a doubt the Coen Bros' best film. Splendid cinematography, a chilling score, clever script, and brilliant performances make this quirky dark comedy a modern classic. Frances McDormand and William H. Macy are especially memorable. BTW to those who say the scene in the bar with Marge and her high-school chum Mikey was unnecessary, this is not so. Mikey tells Marge how he has married and had children, and that her wife had recently passed away. Marge believes her good friend. But several scenes later she finds out that everything he told her was a lie. This makes Marge question the sincerity of Jerry Lundengard when she first interviewed him, because if a sweet good-natured guy like Mikey can concoct such a lie then so could Lundengard. She finds out Mikey lied to her, the VERY NEXT SCENE she returns to the car dealership to re-interview Lundengard who realizes she may have put the pieces together, so he flees the scene. If Marge never met up with Mikey, she wouldn't have exposed Lundengard as a conspirator. This is the reason that amusing scene is so important. Got it? Good. Have a nice day.",10,0,1,9 January 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A true Martial Arts Masterpiece
","Simply put, this movie is a true modern-day classic and deserves all the praise and accolades it has received. Ang Lee must be commended for taking a well-worn genre and injecting new life into it by combining the fantastical with his own expert and subtle direction. 'CTHD' isn't as crazy as some wuxia movies of the past; there are no disappearing ninjas or flat-out gymnastics taking place in the sky, but it perfectly balances the somber, contemplative tone with out-of-this-world martial arts. I'v seen hundreds of films from this genre, 'Duel to the Death', Tsui Hark's classic 'Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain', etc. and I'm happy to say that 'CTHD' ranks with the very best of them.  PS- to all those who are still confused by the 'flying' in this movie, you aren't supposed to question it, it's just something that's commonplace in these kinds of films. So, LET IT GO.

"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A modern day classic
","To anyone out there who may be thinking, 'Is it me or was this movie not that great?' Guess what....it's YOU. This movie works in every single way movies should work. Ang Lee must be praised for taking a genre and injecting new life into it by combining eastern filmmaking ideals and classic Chinese folklore with his own gift for lyrical restraint and expert direction. The movie feels like the beginning of a 'new-school' type of martial arts film, where the very idea of wuxia warriors and Taoist fighting as a means of reaching enlightenment is treated with respect and not as an excuse for stupid, ridiculous fight scenes like so many Jet Li and Donnie Yen flicks.In short, if you want a wall-to-wall action flick with fighting from beginning to end, look elsewhere because 'CTHD' is not it. Sure, there is fighting...but the film is also very slow, contemplative, haunting and downright beautiful. Forget the hype, forget the critics, just sit back and enjoy.  PS-this film must be watched in the original Mandarin. I've heard parts of the English dub on the DVD and it is awful.**** (out of ****)",10,0,0,3 June 2001
Gladiator," Amazing
","This movie is truly amazing. Everything works perfectly together. The acting, look, story, and the music! I can't praise this film enough. Best of 2000 so far. I doubt anything will come close to it.",1,1,10,10 June 2000
