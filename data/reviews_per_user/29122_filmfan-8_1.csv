The Blair Witch Project," Incredilby immersive & compelling psychological/horror film!
","This is a must see not only for all horror film fan, but fans of the art form of film in general.  This will be a movie that will be shown to aspiring film makers.  What makes this movie so effective is the form.  Shot on grainy black and white 16mm and digital video the film looks like a real documentary.  The rough, jittery hand held cameras imerse us in a film like no other.  We see the movie though the character eyes.  We are there with them.  This should be a wake up call to hollywood.  Glitz and special effect are great, but Content is king.  This movie is so good I was furious at the six or seven comments made by people around me.  They yanked me back into the theater.  The immersion was shattered.  An instant classic horror entry. Can't recomend enough.",10,1,2,30 July 1999
