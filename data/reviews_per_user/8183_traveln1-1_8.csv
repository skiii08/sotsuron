The Longest Yard," Longest Lame movie ever
",How many remakes is Hollywood going to make that truly suck. Adam Sandler was pretty good comic relief but the prison scenes drag on way too long. The racist remarks nothing new or refreshing and the football could have been shorter with a new twist. But hey.. Burt Reynolds is so stretched one wonders if they pulled all the way down to his toes to tighten that face. I give it a 1 for truly awful.. wait for the rental then it might be worth it.. Hollywood try taking some risks with some new stories... !!! And Chris Rock was probably the only asset to this horrible script that has nothing new to say which is quite sad.. what is next.. a remake of ET,1,6,12,28 May 2005
Alexander," Worse movie ever by Oliver Stone... wait for DVD if that
","This movie is not only long and horribly cast but the story is so utterly dull and chopped up that one is better suited watching the History channel Alexander story that is at least correct historically. Colin F. does an okay job with this TV miniseries overbudgeted film but besides Val Kilmer and Angeline one wonders why Oliver even made this movie, what was his message since the main character has no arcs that holds any resemblance to being entertaining. And i love most of Oliver's movies but this is just on the realm of being a movie one wants to walk out of esp the tacky cgi scenes that look like something out of a 50s or Japanese godzilla movie, not to mention the gay scenes that lack any substance resembling any depth so at the end of the movie one is left trying to root for the main character because no other character is developed besides his crazy mother who you're not sure if she is medusa, a witch or a demented mother, and the last funny issue is how many characters have lost an eye in this movie that you wonder if they are a part of some macedonian fraternity. I can not stress how this movie is not worth 8 dollars and i debate if worth 3 for rental comparing it to Troy which at least had redeeming characters and a story with a decent flow and fight scenes that made one believe Brad Pitt was capable of fighting.. there is not one scene where Colin shows what motivated him to travel over 10000 miles and over 10 years or what his genius or skills in battle with a sword or hand to hand combat were except a few vague horribly shot blurry quick scenes but ill just leave by saying Oliver please please next time hire some decent writers that know structure, character arcs and a better cgi company.. i mean bablyon looks like a cheap vegas which by the way was burned down by Alexander in a drunken spree which you never put in the movie.... no wonder the greeks are ashamed of your trite movie... just think twice next time when you decide to make a movie - what is your message, and what is the point for wasting one year of your life and eons of money that could have been used on at least 10 independent films but this is an embarrassment of a movie that should have been shelved if you didn't spend so much money and peoples time and money at the theatre. A Big Thumbs down.. and i went in with low expectations.. and i still came out disappointed sitting thru 3 hours of what could have been told in 2 hours or less.... ps. next time hire an independent editor with some sanity.",1,4,5,28 November 2004
Crash," Dramatic Television Film w/out commercials.. but effective
","Crash is an intense dramatic series of extremely short slices of the negative side of LA lives that has the potential of being a masterpiece but instead lacks the balance of both extremes. It is a great directorial debut that lingers on being a 2 hour non stop TV drama w/out commercials that tries to cover so many characters that one wishes Paul would have tried to provide more depth to less characters to enhance the message that feels like a roller-coaster always flying down at 200 mph... but at the same time the edginess and superficiality of this effect truly captures the essence of what it feels like to Live in LA..which could have been another title for it. Perhaps it is due to his background in TV that yearns to provide non stop drama with no depth of character so we wont switch to another channel at the commercial but that is a shame since he covers such wonderful subjects of racism,love and having faith in a system that is so devoid of it these days.But besides this small exception the film delivers stunning acting, quick sometimes too quick of a pace that is so full of dramatic events that one can predict them but with such an all star cast one allows for such exaggerated coincidences to enjoy the insightful message that he keeps pounding thru our heads until the roller-coaster ends with a reminder that indeed.. we can keep crashing or perhaps not.nobody could give away just one spoiler in this movie to ruin it but it surely will be a movie to be talked about for a long time and hopefully more films will follow in his footsteps to make a change and show how we can thru films of this nature.Great job and i highly recommend it... but it isn't a light fun film so be prepared I give it an 8 with potential of a 10 next time",8,0,3,5 June 2005
Closer," A classic that will be in film schools
","I saw a sneak preview of this film and thought it would be good but was stunned by its unique flavor and strong character arcs that leaves you wondering if you're watching a Mamet play or a classic film. The story gets more and more complex and the acting is so superb that it adds a certain believability to it that would lack with a less reputable cast. Jude Law is as always sensational as a variant of his Alfie charaacter, and Natalie Portman has reached a level of maturity that was truly surprising, not to mention wearing some of the sexiest stripper outfits one can imagine. And Clive Owen is a perfect match for Jude that turns into a perfect ego cock match that creates so much delightful drama that you wonder how far they will push the edge. There are parts of the story that seem a bit far-fetched but its Hollywood baby so with this stellar cast you let a few issues like that fly because you truly are at the edge of your seat wondering how twisted these two pairs of lovers will get. If you happen to have just finished with a relationship or been cheated on recently id highly advise to bring your heart ready for rampage or lots of tissues but its depth is so provocative that you leave the theatre with so many questions about your own personal life - which personally is what makes the difference between a basic movie and a magical one that literally makes one believe you're watching a true story.Enjoy and hope you never run into one of these characters.!",10,5,8,2 December 2004
Batman Begins," One of the Best comic book movies ever made...
","This movie was so perfectly scripted it should stand as a model for all other comic book superhero movies... what thrills most of us comic book fans is how the hero ends up on his journey and what lies beneath that makes them become and conquer their fears and embrace a new life as a superhero... this movie not only spends a perfect amount of time delving into Batman's origins but also is finally well acted and not over the top like the other ones, or like Spiderman or Daredevil that are so concerned about the action part that they forget the character development and their super power skills.. which in this case is the main part of the movie. Hopefully it will make the Hollywood ignoramus that is blowing out all of these remakes finally realize that people will pay for well scripted character driven stories with great directing and acting...but it all starts with a great script. Even with Katie Holmes who is totally miscast and couldn't act out of a shoe or be considered a heart throb even with the tantallating tight shirt shots she just is inconceivable as a DA Assistant and perhaps might fit as the DA's secretary at most...she is TV material and not a film star.. even if she is engaged to Cruise.. but even her bad acting doesn't spoil such a great film. Enjoy and you'll definitely get your monies worth if you enjoy classic comic book stories!!! A big 10 plus for Batman",10,1,2,25 June 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Truly Horrific, Slow and painful to watch
","After all the hype for this movie one expects from a seasoned director with two star actors to at least provide a movie that is not truly dull. It has to be an all time slowest and dullest ever Start of any movie I've watched.. it was painful to watch, and i love to watch both actors but still it could have used about half of it edited out to move the pace up a notch. Then it climbs at an old man pace to the actual plot and the chemistry still remains so distant that one wonders if they are reading lines from a card for some commercial, and nobody i mean Nobody in the picture is realistic or not from some beauty contest with overdone make up except for Vince Vaughan who was so out of place and the only comedy relief that should have been written into half the movie because Brad Pitt played his part so straight that nobody laughed thru half of the movie, at Anything. It was a full house and no laughs... but hey.. at least Jolie is amazingly beautiful so thank god she was cast for eye candy.. but she also played the part to her normal level of acting... which hasn't been anything substantial in a looong time.Folks sorry for the spoilers but by the time the movie gets to the 3rd act twist you could careless and are yawning wondering.. when is this thing over.. perhaps if the director had a good editor to cut out 15 minutes from the 1st act and maybe the same from the 2nd then it might move at a faster pace... save your money for the DVD so you can fast forward for your own editing because you're going to need to.I give it a 1 for AWFUL.. and regret spending 12 bucks for such junk!",1,23,43,25 June 2005
Hitch," great comedy, great cast....
",I saw a sneak preview and had little hope for the movie being as good as the trailers since Will Smith has picked some real bombs lately but wow.. what a surprise and it was due to the whole cast being stellar. The movie had some depth to it since the subject matter is rather superficial but it redeems itself and adds some new stars like Kevin James who really steps up the beat to make the 3rd act come alive! And Will Smith is truly splendid in top of his game hitting every part except a few minor corny ones toward the end but this will surely be a film to brighten anyones day and make you laugh for a few hours straight.Big thumbs up and kudos to Sony for finally having a hit!!!,10,2,5,14 February 2005
Sin City," great execution but next project better subject matter
","The film is extremely well done with wonderful execution that makes it by far one of the best if not the best comic book movie of all times. Of course the only issue at hand is Rodriguez and Tarantino being caught up in the violent past of the 80s that is long gone... we had hoped they would have evolved to a more peaceful and spiritual place where they could actually provide entertainment on a deeper level with character development that delves deeper than some basic comic book premature sex, guns and rock n roll phase one goes thru in their teens and twenties and audiences now seek something deeper as seen in horribly directed/executed movies like What the Bleep that has great content but lacks the directing expertise of these directors.. imagine Rodriguez or Tarantino getting a hold of Indigo Children or What the Bleep and we might start to see a huge shift in Independent film making but instead they create the same shallow teenage violent movies with the same heroes of the violent 80s like Willis or Mickey who have the audacity to say that this is good acting...were talking about comic books fellas... not Shawshank Redemption or American Beauty but great job anyways since it is all done via green screen and might lend to more theatrical performances in the future... but perhaps their next project will have more substance but the movie is entertaining if u can stomach the comical endless amount of violence and blood.... and a few nudity shots that somehow got past the puritan graders which was a relief to see.I gave the film an 8 mostly for execution, directing and style but Miller's comic book had a great story but lacked the depth one would want to see put into a 40M film but hey.. its cutting edge.. congrats.",8,0,1,20 April 2005
