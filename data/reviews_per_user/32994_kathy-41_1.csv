Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," good 3 out of 5
","The graphics were fantastic. I found the characters to be boring and uneventful. I think that there was no Han Solo or Luke Skywalker. No romance, or story plot that made you feel for any of the characters. I've seen the other movies a few times but I doubt I would see this again. Nothing to make you want to care.",Null,0,1,24 May 1999
