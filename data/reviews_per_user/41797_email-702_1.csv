The New World," Why?
","I am a great lover of cinema. I watch as much as possibly can. I enjoy many genres and have been fortunate enough to see films from many different countries in many different countries and i like to push the boundaries of conventional cinema in the process. I have never written a film review in the past. I have written to some film-makers, particularly independent film-makers who's work may not have a huge audience, to express my enjoyment of their work, but i have never felt compelled to write a review. After all, opinion is subjective, particularly in relation to art. However, having seen this movie, i feel obligated to make my editorial debut. If you are considering watching this work, please don't. Save yourself those precious minutes. This is by far the worst piece of cinema i have ever seen, be it short or feature. It is self-indulgent, poorly written, woefully performed and immeasurably pretentious. The soundtrack is nice and i grant you that there are some lovely shots of foliage, landscape or nature but these shots usually have no bearing on the story and no function other than to add photographic art. Now i'm an actor, and largely an amateur one with a failed professional career. I can recognize a poor film as i've been in enough. I'd be taking this one off my CV if I were in it. I propose replacing prison incarceration with sentences of watching this film for serious criminals. Repeat offenders would be a thing of the past!",1,0,0,25 June 2012
