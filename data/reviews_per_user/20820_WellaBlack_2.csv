Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Stranger Tides...a good spice added to the main course made of the first three movies
","I am writing this as a fan of Pirates of the Caribbean in hope that other fans will trust me: This movie was good, but it wasn't GREAT. It of course wasn't as good as the first three movies were. It had an entirely different taste. It began in a very fast temp, but later lost it. It did not have the balance the third movie had, and neither was it as active as the second one.From time to time I found myself really missing Keira Knightley(and this surprises me because I've never been particularly fond of her presence in the movies.) Angelica is cool, and a pirate, and has a nice body and all...but Elizabeth was much better(actually Elizabeth was a better fighter than Angelica, which surprised me.) Blackbeard? He's fine, but not awesome. Sometimes looking at him I felt like I was looking at an ordinary old man clinging to his vain beliefs. He is just too dull next to the colourful villains of the previous movies(even Beckett was more colourful.) He did not have the effect Davy Jones had, but still he is a to-be-adored character. I had the feeling that he had a tremendous back-story to himself that was not given(and yet still supposed to be given.) I really liked the mermaids. They were CREEPY,but I loved them. Jack as usual is a pleasure to have on white screen.Johnny Depp did a good job there, but I should say that sometimes the screenplay leaned too hard on Jack and the jokes started getting lame.To me the best thing in the movie was Barbossa. He was the only character that preserved his taste...In the end, yes movie had many faults, but still it was one of those movies you could watch forever. Continuous adventure is fun. And seeing Jack and Gibbs under the sunset, and Barbossa finding his fancy hat and giving his usual 'blaaah' laugh made me forgive and forget everything else. :) So, go and see it- while it's still on the big screen (and by the way, I watched it in 2D and I don't think I missed anything- I'm anti-3D for movies.) It is very fun and you definitely should see it. Don't worry: It is not as bad as it seemed in the trailer, but still know that this movie has an entirely different taste. In the end, I'm sure you'll be very happy too when you see Barbossa wearing his old hat ;)",7,0,0,11 June 2011
Beowulf," Quite entertaining- but too violent(No real big spoilers, I don't give out the climaxes)
","'I am BEOWULF!!!' roars out the epic hero in the trailer; unfortunately the animation(if I may call it so, )was not as impressive for me. It tells a typical epic story(alas, I have never read the poem: )face the beast, then its seductive mother, and then(as a last surprise) the dragon! Knowing that Beowulf heavily inspired 'the Lord of the Rings, ' I expected a deeper story; however, it did not go further than a stereotypical portrayal touching every character on surface. I liked how they interpreted Grendel, showing his terrible physical agony. The movie brings up the question: 'who is the real beast, humankind or the monsters?' Whereas it fails to discuss it seriously and uses it as a nice decoration instead. The performances are quite strong, and actors are not defected or limited by CGI. I watched the animation in 2D and surely know that I would not want to see it in 3D. Actually I thank god that I did not watch it in the cinema as I planned to, for I was totally horrified by the amount of violence and dark images. I still sort of liked the imagery of the attacks of Grendel(like the fire turning blue, or how realistically the queen reacted, or how Grendel treated humankind like a bunch of terrifying bugs,) but I still think that it-by far- was not suitable for a thirteen year old. I would probably come out of the cinema shaking if I were thirteen...(and understand, violence is my nickname, so I am not exaggerating it.) In the end, I can recommend it to you only if your guts are strong enough to see the spilling of other's guts. It is a nice movie night animation to watch with your friends and a good motivator for reading the epic poem, but I probably would not watch it a second time.",5,0,0,6 November 2010
