The Mask," Pure fun, yeah !!!
",I think this film is better to watch two times - so you could give a real price to the actors phrases... Jim could play this role even without a mask i think :) One of the best comedies with great special effects - the best of which is Jimmy The Mask :) If you have never seen it - you missed a lot ! And Cameron (her first role i guess?) - she is just wonderful.,9,1,1,23 January 1999
Predator," The older - the better ?
","On this week i decided to watch this film again - and, u know - i think, i've made a right choice. For 1987 - it is just great - it is great even for our days. Of course - lots of goofs :) but they didn't change my opinion - great action, good story, young Shwarzenegger :), lots of green ;). One of the best action films of 80-s and much better than many of 90-s...",9,0,0,23 January 1999
