Requiem for a Dream," One of the worst movies ever made
","2/10 The reason this movie is third on my bottom of the barrel list (after the Matrix and the Patriot) is because its plot is so simply stupid it is mind numbing.  It just shows things getting worse and worse for people until it stops.  THATS IT!  Let me pitch you a story: Bob loses his job, he finds out his wife is cheating on him, and he then gets robbed.  End of story.  Why is that so great?  If you can answer that then maybe you can explain why this movie has any merit.  Oh and p.s., if any fan of this movie is interested in how the director copied some of his techniques, watch Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels for the same scene where Jennifer Connely leaves the hotel and throws up. Also watch Perfect Blue for the scene where Jen Connely is sitting in the bathtub.",1,7,15,16 July 2003
The Patriot," Grotesquely exaggerated movie that makes me wonder whether the producers are malicious or just plain stupid.
","Do most people have simple functions such as logic?  Well this movie certainly questions that.  I wonder how many people believe that the slaves during this time liked their masters and even went so far as to like their job.  Then again, they were even outdistanced by the British who were shown as nothing better than 18th century Nazis intent on genocide.  It is also interesting to see how a 18th century round-ball musket can hit a man from a hundred yards away (which in reality probably would have gone dead left). And thank you Mel, for playing the American version of William Wallace. Simply put, this movie is more of a comedy than a serious historical movie.",1,9,21,8 October 2001
Drive," Boring, boring, boring....
","I can't believe how boring this movie was. I didn't know a movie could be so boring as this until now. It's high level of boring was maybe only topped by its flatness. The dialogue, in the rare cases there was dialogue, was absolutely uninspiring and unoriginal. The plot was entirely and painfully clichéd. I can't really say the acting was bad, because nothing was asked or expected of the actors, just clichés. I'm trying to think of one scene that someone could point to and say 'that's a truly original scene, I haven't seen that before...' OK, done thinking, there is no such scene. The director should owe a debt of whatever the budget was to another director who actually has talent.",1,2,7,6 October 2011
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," words don't satisfy my love for this movie
","I just watched this twice in the past two days and sweet goodness.  This is without a doubt one of the deepest films I have ever seen, a contender for my number one film of all time. I have to admit, I thought Being John Malkovich was clever but horribly shallow and I thought Adaptation was enjoyable but highly pretentious.  But now that Charlie Kaufman has ditched Spike Jonze for a good concept, the result is movie magic.  I also thought that Jim Carrey couldn't pull something serious off (and I'm not a huge Kate Winslet fan either), but the cast was perfect and completely effective. This movie examines what I find to be one of the most important life philosophies, the concept of memory and the self.  It shows, as I would argue and agree with, that though we may wish that we had never met someone who now causes us pain, it is the good moments you had that are important and that erasing those moments may take away the pain, but it will also take an important piece of you as well. I wish I could feel satisfied with this review (I generally don't with any) but I had to write it anyways to describe the feelings I am having towards the greatness of this film.  It isn't without its flaws, but who can blame the director for problems when dealing with a concept this monumental?",10,0,1,25 March 2004
The Shawshank Redemption," One of the greatest movies in film history.
","The Shawshank Redemption is probably the most widely loved movie in all of Western culture.  It's fleshed out characters give it the uncanny ability to deeply touch most of the people who watch it.  We relate to Freeman's character who has lost hope in society.  Robbins' is the friend who redeems us and gives hope back.  Gunton, who plays Warden Norton, is one of the most overlooked villains of all time.  He makes the greatest villain because he is the most realistic and relatable.  He isn't a crazy murderer, he is a corrupt religious official.  I believe this movie gets better when you have already seen it and know what happens.  Seeing the wardern get what's coming to him is consistently satisfying.  And of course, the famous beach scene leaves me on a high every time.  11/10",10,0,0,17 June 2003
