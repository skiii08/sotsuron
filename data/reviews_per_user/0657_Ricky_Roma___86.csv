The New World," Not Malick's best, but a fine film regardless (spoilers)
","I'm not sure why Colin Farrell keeps on getting cast in so many big films. His movies rarely make a lot of money and he's not especially talented. He's the kind of actor who can just about tread water  he doesn't ruin the films he's in, but he does nothing to enhance them either. And so it is with The New World.In Terence Malick's film, Farrell plays Captain John Smith. And once again Farrell exhibits his curious lack of talent without truly embarrassing himself. Although he does come close once or twice. There's one scene with Pocahontas (Kilcher) where they're trying to communicate and she touches his hair  he plays the moment like a naughty little schoolboy, giving coy little glances to the side before fixing his eyes on her. It's an amateurish piece of acting.I also dislike the way that Farrell plays Smith as a sort of English Fabio. He's got long hair, an earring, dreamy eyes and he wears sleeveless shirts (which are often open) so that he can show off his muscles. It's a character that seems tailor made for little girls, which I guess is apt considering the material. But seriously, it's a juvenile representation of Smith and one that hinders an otherwise fine film.But this miscalculation isn't as disastrous as it could have been, as Malick's visual sense more than holds the film together  it becomes quite easy to tune Farrell out. One of my favourite shots is of Smith wading through a swamp in a full suit of armour. It's a nice way of visualising the tension between the pioneers and the new world they plan to conquer  they may be more technologically advanced than the natives, but they're also more cumbersome.Another fabulous shot that makes the same point cuts from a beautiful underwater shot of children and fishes to the pioneers' boats. Here you have a feeling of paradise coming to an end, of a steamroller squashing everything that gets in its way. Not that the pioneers arrive with bad intentions. No, they're escaping religious persecution  they just want a home. And Smith even talks about how there'll be no landlords, how they'll be no poor and how everyone will work hard to build a true commonwealth. Well, I guess we all start things with good intentions.But despite Smith's desire to help build a settlement, he never really feels at home with the pioneers. He actually feels more at home with the Natives  a people who (eventually) make him feel part of their tribe and who (at first) reject notions of greed. And on top of this, Smith falls for the Indian chief's most beloved daughter.The romance between Smith and Pocahontas isn't quite as convincing as it should be. This is mostly because of Farrell's acting (see the moment when Pocahontas touches his hair), but it's also because, seeing as Pocahontas is an adolescent, the film has to tread lightly. Therefore we get a lot of shots of the couple wandering about in fields gazing into each other's eyes  they don't even kiss. So as a result it all feels a bit unbelievably pure.Things actually improve once the couple have separated. I enjoyed the scenes in Jamestown where you get to compare the miserable English children, mouthy and filthy as only English children can be, with the Natives, and where you contrast the cold, muddy, walled pioneer settlement with the welcoming one Smith left behind  he's exchanged paradise for misery. And I also love some of the small details in this Jamestown sequence  the futile way the pioneers dig for gold while they're starving, the insane preacher and the fact that the settlers have to eat their belts to stay alive. Consequently you can't help but feel that Pocahontas' mercy mission to give the white man food was a grave miscalculation  the Natives certainly would have been better off had whitey starved to death. But the scene where the Natives come to give the white man food is a good one and it gives Smith and Pocahontas one of their best scenes  the more restrained scenes are more effective than the ones where the couple get to walk endlessly around fields.But this moment of peace doesn't last long and the tensions soon flare up again, which leads to some enjoyable battle sequences. And I also enjoyed the scenes, after Pocahontas is expelled from her village for giving the settlers seeds, where the Native girl is made to become an English one. On the one hand it's quite amusing watching her being made over by some ghastly English troll, but on the other it's sad to see a large part of her identity being scrubbed away.But unfortunately, after this, the film goes through a bit of a slump. There's a second romance (after Smith's 'death', Pocahontas marries Christian Bale's character) and the new couple end up going to England. Here you get some nice moments (Pocahontas arriving in the old country and being completely fascinated by it) but the narrative comes to a grinding halt. Plus you can't help but feel that Bale would have been much better than Farrell in the Smith role. Sure Bale usually plays madmen and he's not your typical romantic lead, but he's a fine actor so no role should really be beyond him.However, despite the final twenty minutes or so dragging somewhat, the film recovers with a splendid ending. It's quite difficult to say why it works so well, but instead of merely pleasing the eye, the film finally manages to achieve a level of emotion is doesn't quite generate elsewhere.",Null,2,5,23 September 2006
Scarface," Shakespearian-style tragedyif you're a chav (spoilers throughout)
","No wonder chavs and the hip-hop community look up to Tony Montana. He has no style, no class and is a deluded, loudmouth knob. What a perfect role model for individuals who think that bad clothes, bad music and an early death are all wonderful things to aspire to.I don't think anyone can watch Scarface and objectively call it a great film. It's a loud, garish coked-up mess that takes three hours to show an ambitious Cuban immigrant get rich and then screw up and die (drugs are bad, mmkay?). That's all there is to the film. Tony Montana isn't Michael Corleone. He isn't a multi-faceted character. He's a cardboard cut out, albeit an enjoyable one. Now I'm sure chavs probably see Scarface as an emotional Shakespearian-style tragedy, but for me it's more of a comedy.Just take the near incestuous relationship between Tony and his sister. It's hilarious! When they first meet it's more like a reunion between lovers than a brother and a sister being reacquainted. They give each other lingering glances, they hug and horribly saccharine music plays in the background. Then, as the film progresses, Tony gets jealous whenever his grown-up sister gets any attention from other men. These moments are even funnier. The camera tightens on Tony's face, and apoplectic with rage, loud, piercing sirens of synthesised music play on the soundtrack to communicate his displeasure. He only has eyes for his afro-permed sister and woe betide any man who comes between him and that unsullied ass. Which leads me to the scene where he finds out that his best friend has been sleeping with his kin. He scrunches his face like he's messed himself and then he blows his friend away. Afterwards sad music, denoting the tragedy of the scene, floods the speakers, but I couldn't stop laughing. Nor could I when afro-perm tries to kill Tony and she gets blown away, and when Tony tearful tries talking to her dead corpse. I imagine if you're high on coke this might be tragic, but to anyone not under the influence of hard drugs it's bloody funny.Less amusing, and actually rather boring, is Tony's relationship with his wife (played by Michelle Pfeiffer). Has there ever been a duller screen romance? Or has there ever been a character so overwhelmingly dreary? I don't think so. Now I know that that's kind of the point. Pfeiffer is supposed to be playing an indolent junkie. But if anything she's too good at it. I nearly fell asleep every time she was on the screen. In fact, in one scene, she even said, 'I'm bored.' You're not the only one. No wonder Tony fancies his sister.Thankfully, though, there's the music to pick you up when the story is getting bogged down. Is it the worst score in film history? In parts: yes. But is it funny? Gut-achingly so. Now I have to say that the main title music and the main theme are pretty good  love that whip effect! But the songs; dear Lord! To think that De Palma actually had this dross commissioned  he didn't just pick bad songs; he had them made. The worst one has to be something called 'Dance Dance Dance'. It plays during the club scene where the clown gets mowed down by two hit men who are trying to kill Tony  they're worse shots than the A-Team. It's a travesty. But at least it, and the other terrible songs, make the club scenes so amusingly trashy  the bad clothes, perms and porn moustaches that the extras wear also help.But the best/worst use of music has to be in the 'Push it to the Limit' montage. It's a classic. Juxtaposed against this hilarious piece of 80s pop rock ('Walk along the razor's edge, don't look down, just keep your head, or you'll be finished') you have laughing drug dealers, Tony checking out his own sister as she tries on clothes for him, footage of Tony's tasteless new residence (it's like MTV's Cribs) and assorted moments from his wedding  the best being a tiger tied to a tree and the lingering glances between Tony's sister and Tony's best mate (by the way, in these moments, it looks like Tony's sister has streaks of dried snot hanging from her hair).However, this montage follows one of the movie's legitimately good scenes  the one where Tony has Frank killed and seizes power. It's brutal, it's calculating and it's very enjoyable. And I've always loved the moment where Tony sees the blimp with the message 'The World is Yours' streaking across it. It's pure cinema, and the music (for once) perfectly fits the visuals  it's also fitting that a man like Tony Montana would get his motto from a commercial. The chainsaw scene is also great. De Palma knows how do set-pieces. And of course the final shoot-out is magnificent fun  it almost banishes the bad scenes from my memory. But although there are good bits, there's too much dross in-between for me to take the film seriously. It's certainly nowhere near as good as Carlito's Way. Plus it annoys me that people idolise Tony Montana. Why? He's an idiot. And he's not even that ruthless. There's one scene where he refuses to detonate a bomb because it will kill a couple of children. What sort of villain is he? But of course, one of the reasons for this, is that he wants a kid but can't have one with Michelle Pfeiffer. So all the hard man wants is a baby? That's not very hip-hop. Nor is the way that being rich makes him miserable. So although Tony Montana might have a big pile of cocaine on his desk, and while he may have a big gun, he's really just a loudmouth, self-pitying, coked-up loser that wants to sex with his sister. Yep, he's a man to admire.",Null,14,30,12 September 2005
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A very funny movie film
","I like the fact that so many people tried to get themselves removed from the Borat film. Look, you got caught being a sexist, or a racist, or a gigantic pussy  just live with it; that's the whole point of Borat, to expose people's prejudices and idiocy with a sly wink of complicity. Sure Sacha Baron Cohen helped put the noose round your neck, but you chose to hang yourself.The scene that makes me laugh the most in Borat is the dinner scene where the Kazakh reporter is invited to a posh Southern dinner party. At first he embarrasses himself in a minor way by asking whether one of the guests is a retard and by questioning the attractiveness of one of the women, but despite this the hostess is still optimistic. When Borat excuses himself to go to the toilet, she confidently states that it wouldn't take much to civilise this uncouth individual  he could be Americanised in no time. But then Borat returns with a pile of poo in a bag  his poo. This causes red faces aplenty, but still the hostess tries to muddle through. She even shows Borat how to defecate properly. But it's only when a black prostitute comes a knocking at the door that the hostility begins. Somehow defecating in a bag, calling someone a retard and calling a guest ugly is acceptable (albeit in an exasperating kind of way), but the presence of a black person in this Southern haven is beyond the pale. Nothing is more offensive than this.Another scene that jabs at America's dark underbelly is the rodeo sequence. Yeah, Borat's cries of jingoistic encouragement are amusing, but it's the exchange between Borat and the cowboy that's more revealing. This fool spouts nonsense about killing all the Iraqis and then suggests that all of America's homosexuals should be removed too. He even says something along the lines that 'they' (he takes it upon himself to speak for the country) should all be strung up. And this is what makes Borat such a great character. By acting like such an idiot he puts everyone at their ease. And it's only when people are comfortable that the truth comes spilling from their mouths.Another painful truth is the misogyny that is present in certain sections of American society. The frat boys, for instance, spout nonsense about men being better than women. Indeed, after the tearful revelation that Pamela Anderson is not a virgin, they tell a distraught Borat that he's better than any female. For all the progress that Western society has made, it still hasn't really got that far. And also in the frat boy sequence, the drunken idiots claim that the minorities have the most power. What the hell have they been smoking? Doubtless, later in life, when their marriages fall apart and their careers go nowhere, they'll blame the Jews, the gays and the blacks for their failures. They'll do anything but take a hard look at themselves.A less insightful sequence that had me chuckling was the one on the New York subway. I just love how willing New Yorkers are to tell someone to go f*** themselves. Here in London, Borat's acts would only be greeted by looks of bemusement and the odd muttered insult. New Yorkers, though, are perfectly happy to get in someone's face. And there's an even funnier bit on the streets where a New Yorker, backed into a corner by Borat, tells the Kazakh to get out of his face, that he'll pop him in the balls if he doesn't back away (?!?). Quite why this individual would chose to pop Borat in the balls, I'm not sure (there are so many easier places to pop), but the humourless 'get out of my face' aggression that is particular to New York never fails to put a smile on my lips.Something else that put a smile on my lips was the naked wrestling scene. There are few things less joyous in life than two men fighting in the buff ('my moustache still tastes of your testes', says Borat later on). And I love the way that Borat's penis is obscured by a massive black letterbox. You just know that Borat has been in the editing room, trying to make himself look as good as possible. But although the homoerotic grappling garners laughs aplenty, there's a wonderful little moment that is easy to miss. The fight spills out into the hotel and they even get into a lift. But while most of the people run out in horror, one man remains  he stares passively forward, desperately trying not to lose his dignity.But although the film points its finger at the numerous freaks and idiots it encounters along the way, it also points its finger at the audience. Just how willing are we to buy into this myth of Kazakhstan  a place where old ladies are 34, where cattle live in houses with their owners and where men snog their sisters (and who are also prostitutes). Few things give us greater pleasure than a false sense of superiority. Our lives may be rubbish, we think, but at least we don't have it this bad. Therefore you can't help but ask yourself why you're laughing at some of these jokes  am I really that far removed from the homophobic cowboy or the misogynistic frat boys? My excuse is that I'm a jerk. What's yours?",Null,7,12,5 August 2007
Alien 3," The series should have ended here (spoilers throughout)
","Alien 3, by and large, is considered a poor film. Most people see it as a lazy re-hash of the first instalment and most people hate the way that it dispensed with the other surviving characters of Aliens. Well, I can kind of see their point. Alien 3, like the first, does opt for the dark, claustrophobic atmosphere of the first and it does have the same stalk and slash mentality  there are no big guns here. And, yes, it does rather ruthlessly kill off the characters of Aliens. But I can't really see it being any other way. The Alien series isn't about Hicks or Newt. It's about Ripley, and it's always been her alone against the alien. To have Hicks and Newt tagging along would feel like Aliens Revisited. It would just be, for the second time, Ripley fighting the alien to protect her surrogate daughter. At least here she gets to do something different. It isn't a fight for survival, or a fight to protect Newt. It's a fight to keep the alien away from The Company.One of the many things that annoyed and enraged me about Alien Resurrection (now there's an Alien film truly worthy of revulsion) was the way that they dispensed with the main villain of the piece, the mysterious, all-seeing company. That was one of the fun things in the series. You felt like there was something bigger and more important going on. And the filmmakers developed it superbly. In the first film it was only on the periphery. But in the second film, with Burke, it was brought to the front. So I like the way that Alien 3 develops it even further. The Company has an almost Orwellian presence. It seems to see everything. And so Ripley's fight to kill the alien before The Company can get it's hand on it seems entirely convincing. Indeed, there's a great scene  one of those rabble-rousing moments you only see in films  where she explains The Company's motivation to the prisoners. It's an excellent nod to the fans and one that gets you even more fully behind her cause. Don't trust those greedy capitalists, man.Of course, the company man in the film (Aaron) is a stupid sheep, but rather than ape what Cameron did with Burke  and make him totally untrustworthy  he's just a man trying to do his job and earn a living. And at the end, after lots of abuse from the prisoners, he actually grows a set and takes a swipe at one of the company men. Too bad, then, that this action gets him killed. I mean, during the final sequence, when all the prisoners are being chased by the alien in the maze, he finds a quiet room and sits it out. I thought, then, that this might show a new dawning of intelligence. But instead, after looking like he's been saved, he does something brave, but stupid, and gets himself killed. You've got to know when to pick your fights, Aaron.Another complaint that people seem to toss in the direction of Alien 3 is that the characters all look the same. Well, personally, I think the characters stand out pretty damn well. Sure they may all have shaved craniums, but I think that the writing and the acting are pretty damn strong. They all have distinct personalities  which is a pretty good feat when you're dealing with rapists, murders and pederasts  and it's only the ones that get killed in seconds that feel generic. Dillon stands out the most. He's the kind of hardnut that can kick your head in and say something poetic at the same time. Plus, he takes the alien on in hand-to-hand combat and insults the alien's fighting skills as he's being killed. How can you not dig a man like that? In fact, he's one of the best anti-heroes in a long time. Charles S. Dutton is excellent. I also think that Charles Dance is great. He gets killed off rather early, but he makes his scenes count. And he even gets to sleep with Ripley. Sure, in film tradition, this means that he has to die, but, hey, at least he went there. And Brian Glover, Ralph Brown, Pete Postlethwaite and Paul McGann are superb. Plus I like the way that one of the more peripheral characters survives.And the film is also quite poetic. The cremation scene in particular stands out. It has some great dialogue, a fantastic score and the alien birth is beautiful in a perverse way. And the final moments, too, are great.But what of the alien in this film? Well, aside from the occasional dodgy bit of effects work in the maze sequence  it sometimes moves like its got piles  it's pretty damn good. It's certainly better than the gloop covered monsters of Resurrection. And it gets some pretty good moments. The killing where the blood sprays over Paul McGann's face is nice, as is the amusing killing of Brain Glover. And I also like the bit where it meets Ripley face to face. Somehow, in the Jeunet film, the aliens were no longer threatening, but in Alien 3 it still has the right stuff. Perhaps the one miscue is giving the alien a POV shot  I didn't think the alien had eyes  but, hey, the shots work visually, so who cares? And I think the film would have been a fitting end to the series. Ripley finally meets The Company and she sacrifices herself to deny them and to save mankind. That's pretty good going in my book. And I wouldn't have thought the character would have anywhere to go if they somehow would have managed to bring her back to life. Well, when I first saw it, I had hopes for Resurrection, but unfortunately, I was proved right. The series should have ended here.",Null,1,4,16 August 2005
3:10 to Yuma," A successful modern Western (spoilers throughout)
","3:10 to Yuma has one major flaw: at the end Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) doesn't half seem keen to help Dan Evans (Christian Bale) out. Through the town they run, dodging bullets, and then they even take to the roofs and leap between buildings. Really, would a hardened criminal who wanted to avoid jail be so compliant, especially when his gang is there, trying to shoot down his captor? Plus, why does Ben run at all? He could quite easily just stand there and refuse to move  not for one second did I believe that Dan would gun him down in cold blood.Of course, Ben's motivation is explained somewhat. He develops a grudging respect for the herder and in a scene near the end when he briefly displays some obstinacy, he stops himself from killing Dan when Dan tells him the true story of how he lost his leg. So basically Ben goes along with this man so that Dan can be a hero to his son. Very noble, but not entirely believable. Although having said that, the end, where Ben whistles to his horse as the train leaves the station, suggests that Ben never had any real intention of going to jail, that he was always going to escape. So maybe his playing along with Dan isn't quite as ridiculous as it initially feels.That aside, though, I thought the film was marvellous. And although the ending still nags me somewhat, I did love the final few moments. The gunning down of Dan took me completely by surprise and I almost cheered when Ben smoked his gang. And bloody hell is Ben quick on the draw  I loved how quickly and casually he gunned them down. Plus I loved the way that sound of the train standing in the station became the soundtrack for the sequence  it added a whole layer of tension that would have been missing had it been scored.However, it can't have been just me that noticed a homoerotic undercurrent in the relationship between Ben and his main underling Charlie. Charlie seems to go to almost superhuman lengths to free his boss. Plus there's the way that he seems almost disappointed that Ben wants to score some poontang. There they are, hanging out in a saloon, and Ben wants to nail the broad behind the bar rather than the skinny geezer sitting next to him. But Charlie doesn't take it to heart. He tells his boss that he'll be near, and then once Ben gets arrested he's free to express his longing in more physical ways.The best example is when Charlie beats one of his gang members. The man's crime? Bad-mouthing Ben. Really, Charlie may as well be some sassy broad on Maury Povich, screaming, 'Don't talk no smack about my man.' But this doesn't detract from the film at all. Indeed, Charlie is a pretty fine underling. He doesn't take any crap, he's ruthless (I loved the way he burnt a man to death) and he's completely immoral (dig the way he shot the pussy lawmen who try and cut and run). Plus you know a villain has done their job when you almost cheer their demise. 'Take that', I thought, as Ben finally penetrated him (albeit with hot lead rather than the sweet, sweet love pistol he was gagging for).But can you really blame Charlie for developing a man-crush on his boss? Certainly the scene where Neanderthal poet Russ he picks up the barmaid is very sexy, and you can't help but feel that both Dan's wife and son would happily betray ol' peg leg for this hunk of a man if he made a bona fide move on them. Indeed, Crowe's performance is one of the best he's turned in for quite a while. He's got the edge that the character demands and he also seems to be enjoying himself immensely  his performance is infectious.Unfortunately Bale pales somewhat in comparison. He's certainly just as good a performer, but he never stands a chance with his character, a man who is entirely decent but also just a tad dull. There's not really a whole lot of complexity to him. He's just a good man who has to go to lengths to secure his family's financial wellbeing.Therefore it's Crowe who gets all the great moments. One of my favourite bits was when he threw Peter Fonda over the edge of a cliff for bad-mouthing his mother. Take that you old bastard! And then as already mentioned, there's the scene with the barmaid. But I also liked the way he killed the guy who spent all his time taunting him  he stabs him with a steak fork in the middle of the night. Nice.But the film's actually pretty brutal. As well as the stabbing you have a gruesome surgery scene, more shootings than you can shake a stick at and a prolonged torture scene where poor Russ gets electrocuted. The film doesn't pull its punches.And there are a couple of fantastic action sequences. There's the bit with the Gatling gun on the back of the coach (which is kind of a nod to The Wild Bunch) and there's also the chase along the railroad. Sure both are fanciful, especially the moment where Dan shoots the stick of dynamite that Ben throws in the air, but it's done with enough verve to make one forget such silliness.But as to whether the film deserves to be an Oscar contender, I'm not so sure. It's a simple film well done, but that shouldn't be enough for awards. It's certainly no Unforgiven. But still, it's a successful stab at a modern Western.",Null,1,2,5 October 2007
Raiders of the Lost Ark," First and still the best (spoilers)
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is an action masterpiece. There's not one bit of fat on its bones. There's not one wasted moment. It flows exactly like an adventure movie should  it continually moves forward, breathlessly driving you towards the conclusion; it's incredible fun.The reason why the film works so well is because the script is so tight. The exposition is clear and well delivered, meaning that you know precisely what's at stake, small character details are set up early on and paid off later and the dialogue is incredibly pithy. It's a masterclass in film writing.However, this would mean nothing if all the other elements didn't come together. Thankfully they do. Spielberg's direction is superb, Harrison Ford is perfect as the hero, Karen Allen is wonderful as the heroine and the music is out of this world. Plus the action is kick ass. My favourite action scene is the fight with Pat Roach by the plane. Quite unusually for a film hero, Indy doesn't mind fighting dirty. He kicks Roach in the balls, he throws sand in his face and he even bites him. Indy doesn't have to win a fight fairly. And it's also unusual for a film hero to be so vulnerable. We rarely see anyone get a scratch or put in any real jeopardy. But here Indy gets his arse handed to him. The only reason he survives is because he's so wily  after getting beaten and bruised for a while he leads Roach into getting chopped up by the plane's rotor blades.My second favourite action sequence is when Indy chases after the Ark and recovers it by hijacking a Nazi truck. After the CGI mess of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, it's great to see old-fashioned stunts. It's a much better way of letting you get absorbed by the action  even though you know it's a film, you know someone actually had to do this, making everything much more impressive to watch. The best stunt is when Indy is thrown through the front window and has to pull himself along the bottom of the truck. He manages to do this and then hooks his whip under the bottom so that he's dragged along the ground. He then manages to get back on the truck and back in the cabin. It's a joy to behold and allows you to immerse yourself in the action. Another great thing about the sequence is that once again we're shown Indy's vulnerability. As he's driving he gets shot in the arm. And then later a guy punches him in his injured arm and throws him out of the truck. Therefore when Indy comes back and beats the crap out of this guy, it's doubly satisfying, because not only is the guy a damn Nazi, but he also had the audacity to try and injure our hero. And the blood and guts reminds me of how gritty the film is. Not only do we have Indy getting shot in the arm and then having the wound beaten, but earlier on a guy gets shot in the face  lots of blood pours down from the hole in his skull. Oh, and he's also on fire. Excellent. But as well as this there's also stuff that is just plain over the top. The melting faces for instance and Belloq's head exploding. This scared the hell out of me as a kid and I'm still amazed that stuff like this was included in a 'kids' film.However, the scene that terrified me the most as a kid was the scene where Marion gets mugged by skeletons and we then see a large snake oozing from a skull's mouth. I was so traumatised I refused to watch the film for years. But now the vague horror element is another reason I adore the movie. It sets it apart from almost every action/adventure film that came before it and nothing else has managed to better it, even subsequent Indiana Jones films. But watching the film now it's quite unusual to note that Indy doesn't kill any of the three main villains. They're all killed by the Ark. Indy instead just closes his eyes and lets 'god' do the rest. It's a strange ending but one that works perfectly. Indy isn't a killing machine. He's someone trying to do the right thing. And at the end he's rewarded by, well, not having his face melted off.Another reason why Raiders stands out is because of its heroine. She's one of the best in modern cinema  a tough woman who constantly shows her toughness without having to resort to ridiculous feats of physicality. We don't see her pummel men who are twice her size, but we do see her out smart them and drink them under the table. As well as this she has great chemistry with Indy. For instance, there's the marvellous scene where she tries to look after our injured hero and he cries like a girl every time she touches him. He then points out a few places where it doesn't hurt, which she kisses. It's a lovely scene. And I also like the bit of slapstick humour earlier where Indy gets a mirror smashed in his face when Marion turns it over. This leads me to another reason why Raiders is brilliant. It's very funny. You have a monkey giving a Nazi salute, Indy nonchalantly shooting a swordsman, Sallah's cowardly reactions at the Well of Souls and the Gestapo man plunging his hand in the snow after he gets it burnt while trying to grab an extremely hot bronze medallion. The humour is great.And on top of all of this cinematic goodness  the humour, the action, the adventure  you have one of the best opening sequences in film. It's a bravura piece of film-making  everything clicks perfectly.",Null,8,14,2 June 2008
Spartacus," Not a classic Kubrick film, but a classic sword and sandals epic (spoilers)
","Most Kubrick fans tend to look down on Spartacus. This is for a variety of reasons, but the main one is that it's the only film Kubrick made as a hired gun  he certainly didn't have full creative control. Well, hired gun or not, I think Spartacus is a fine film. It's one of the best epics ever made.The most enjoyable part of Spartacus is undoubtedly the first third  the section dealing with the training of the gladiators. It's kind of like a Roman Full Metal Jacket  we get to see a bunch of 'recruits' get trained and abused by a loudmouth bully. But unlike Full Metal Jacket, we not only get mind games, we get proper sexual humiliation too. For instance, there's a scene where the gladiators, as a reward, get the company of a woman. Spartacus gets Varinia (Jean Simmons), but he says he's never had a woman before (as good as he is in the film, I still find it hard to buy the horny Kirk Douglas, he of the rocking trailer, as a virgin). And then immediately afterwards, Marcellus (the trainer) and Batiatus (the establishment's owner, played by Peter Ustinov) appear at a hole in the ceiling and laugh at him. It's a wonderfully cruel scene.Another fantastic little moment is when, a little while after his first encounter with her, Varinia is taken to Spartacus' room/cell. The door is opened for her, but before she can walk in, Marcellus says that she's going to go to the Spaniard instead. It's a superb piece of mental torture  see the woman you've fallen in love with and then hear her get nailed by another one of the gladiators.Yet another excellent scene is when a group of Romans, led by Crassus (Laurence Olivier), visit Batiatus' training school. For their own amusement they want to see matched pairs fight to the death. But the women in the group not only want to see the men fight and die, they want them to do it in as little clothing as possible. Only enough for modesty, one of them says. And there's also a great bit when one of the women drools over a big black gladiator  these men were obviously a sexual fantasy for a lot of Roman women.And the fights themselves are superb. The first is filmed through the slats of a door that Spartacus is looking through, and the second, which features Spartacus himself, sees him battle Woody Strode. But what makes the second fight so enjoyable is the little details. For example, the women are really into it, but the men are bored  they talk amongst themselves as the gladiators fight to the death; this entertainment is ordinary and rather mundane. Another great detail is how bloodthirsty the women are. They're the ones who call for the loser to be killed and they're the ones who are most outraged when Strode won't do what he's supposed to.After this, though, things take a slight turn for the worse. We start to get some heavy handed moralising and we get all the inevitable talk about freedom. But unlike some, the romance between Spartacus and Varinia never bothers me. Sure the otherwise excellent score gets a bit too cloying in their romantic scenes, but Douglas and Simmons have superb chemistry and they lend the film a lot of warmth. Much worse for me are the small moments that litter the film  a couple burying their baby, an old lady squirting milk in a child's face and everyone gazing lovingly at Spartacus like he's a dimpled slave Jesus as he wanders the camp at night. These moments are obviously meant to add colour and to pull our heartstrings, but they're far too blatant  they have all the subtlety of a hammer blow between the eyes.Much more successful are the senate scenes, especially the exchanges between Laughton and Olivier. You really can tell they don't like one another, and their attempts to outdo each other add to the characters and the film. I also like the brief moments between Curtis and Olivier, but perhaps in a rather sniggering sort of way. There's just something rather amusing about Sir Larry ordering a Bronx-born slave Curtis to be his 'body servant'  ooh er, missus. And the 'snails and oysters' scene is well done, too, and exceedingly homoerotic as well (Spartacus is one of the few sword and sandals epics to include homoeroticism on purpose, rather than have it occur as a natural by-product of beefy men wandering about in their pants).But although the film sags in its middle section, it picks up again at the end. One of the best scenes is the final battle  the chopped limb and the sword through the neck are attention grabbers, but the best bit is in the pre-battle; the way the Roman formations change. It's a magnificently visual way of contrasting the two armies  the mass of slaves, standing as one, and their organised opponents using strategy and cunning.And even though it's been parodied to death, the 'I'm Spartacus' scene is still a great. As is the final scene where Simmons confronts Spartacus as he hangs on the cross. In the wrong hands it could have been maudlin in the extreme, but it actually comes across as rather hopeless  Douglas, when looking down on his newborn son, doesn't appear to be full of joy and love. Instead he almost looks angry  he's lost and he knows it, and even though his wife and son are free, everyone else is no better off than when he started. Indeed they might even be worse off. And it's this final defeat that ultimately makes Spartacus stand out  it doesn't provide us with miracles; every victory is hard earned.",Null,4,7,1 January 2007
United 93," A masterpiece
","The final scenes in United 93 have to be some of the most harrowing in cinema. What you witness is a frantic desire to live conflict with an insane desire to die. People become animals  rational thought gives way to instinct and barbarism, resulting in tragedy.One of the most despairing images in this magnificent film has to be that of the passengers desperately pushing and driving one of their number towards the cockpit. The guy they're manoeuvring is a pilot of single engine planes and represents their one small hope of making it out of this alive. Knowing full well what happened to the passengers of United 93, the desperation is gut wrenching. You know they're not going to make it and that these are the death throes of those on board.The agony of the final moments is amplified by the way that the pilot briefly manages to get his hands on the controls. Whether this happened in real life, no one knows, but it perfectly illustrates the conflict that occurred and the conflict that is happening now. Both sides desperately want to be in the driving seat but all the time things are spiralling out of control. In the end, everyone loses and nothing is gained.Something else I like about the final moments is the disturbing catharsis when the passengers overwhelm the hijackers. This is probably the last time in the 'war on terror' where things will be black and white. The hijackers are wrong and deserve the brutal response of their captives. After this, though, everything becomes hazy and muddy. The tragedy gets twisted and it becomes the fuel for political greed.But in that moment where the first hijacker gets overwhelmed and killed, there's a feeling of joy and exaltation that is primal. You're put in the position of the passengers and you feel the excitement they must have felt  maybe we can get out of this; maybe we can regain control. But it's a mass delusion. There's no turning back now. Things will never be the same.But what's also great about the film is that there's no flag waving. This film isn't a call to arms. It isn't a rallying cry. Instead it's a grimly realistic depiction of the chaos that ensues when barbarism overwhelms normality. When something this audacious and unexpected occurs, all the controls that keep the world in check go flying out the window.Some of the loons out there who want to believe in ridiculous conspiracy theories will point out that the response to the tragedy was too patchy and that communication couldn't be that bad. They've obviously never had a job. Sometimes it's hard enough to communicate clearly with someone downstairs in the same office as you, let alone in an office hundreds of miles away. Plus communication between governmental departments and agencies is notoriously poor. Therefore I can well believe that the response would be so impotent.But the tale that unfolds in air traffic control centres and at NORAD is just as engrossing as the one in the plane. Like the passengers in United 93, they're wrestling with the enormity of the situation. No one can quite believe that this is happening and the sheer scale of the attack is beyond their comprehension. As a consequence people continually try and come to more realistic conclusions.A clear, fast response also isn't helped by inaccurate information. When a plane hits the first tower, it's said that a small civil aircraft hit it. And then NORAD are told that American Airlines 11 is heading for Washington when it's actually hit the World Trade Centre. Yes technology is better these days, but we still don't live in a world where we have accurate information available at our fingertips the very second it happens. And it's galling to know that even the government has to get its updates from CNN.A chilling moment that occurs in the film is when air traffic control are trying to communicate with American Airlines 11. The plane is over New York and they're desperately trying to talk to the pilot. But then the plane disappears off the screen. But even though we know it's hit the tower you can still understand the confusion. Even though the flight has disappeared, who can imagine such a thing? Things only start to become clear when the second plane nears Manhattan. And then it's too late. People watching the smoking tower see the second plane crash into the other building. The attack is almost over before people can understand what's going on.And the only reason that the fourth plane didn't hit the Capitol Building is because United 93 was delayed. Sure some imbeciles can question why the passengers of that flight didn't take the plane sooner, but they didn't know what was going on. When you don't know what's going on, you're powerless. But once they hear about the other flights, they decide to act. And the one bright spot in that miserable day is that these passengers fought back and prevented further loss of life.But I really can't overstress how great this film is. There are no attempts to demonise. There are no attempts to play for false emotion. You're just dropped in this hellish situation and expected to deal with it. It just feels real.And very often it feels painfully real. The build-up constantly had me on edge. The tension is palpable. And then there's the heartbreak of people phoning home and the desperation of the attack on the cockpit. Paul Greengrass has fashioned a masterpiece here. He's made a film that is visceral and heartbreaking and that makes no concessions to the audience. It's one of the greatest films of the last few years.",Null,16,27,30 July 2008
Minority Report," Something of a disappointment (spoilers throughout)
","A complicated plot should never be confused with genuine complexity, as a story that relies completely on twists and narrative gymnastics is as shallow as cinema gets. Sure you may be worked hard to figure everything out but if the answer is essentially meaningless or trite, then so what? And that's kind of the feeling you get from watching Minority Report. You're made to struggle and you're made to decipher a labyrinthine plot, but the revelation when it comes is like something out of Agatha Christie. Basically the film's a whodunit with bells and whistles on.The emotions, too, don't help the film. As you'd expect from Spielberg every emotional moment is covered in a thick layer of treacle. There's the bit when Samantha Morton talks about how much love used to be in Anderton's house. It could have been a nice moment but the bright light, tears and sappy dialogue is ordering you how to feel. And then there's the video of Anderton's dead son. Again it could have been a nice moment but instead the kid is so gosh-darn cute that it defies belief. Ordinary kids just aren't like that.Much more successful, somewhat surprisingly for Spielberg, are the darker moments. There's a great scene when you see Anderton and his kid at the swimming pool. Anderton sinks to the bottom to show how long he can hold his breath, but then when he resurfaces his kid has gone. It captures all the terror of losing a child with great skill.I also like the scene where Anderton is confronted with his child's 'killer'. Anderton, quite rightly, is utterly deranged and Cruise does an excellent job of selling the character's anger and grief. Therefore it's slightly annoying that these great darker moments have to co-exist with such schmaltz. Just take the ending. Pre-crime is shut down, Anderton is reunited with his wife, Anderton's wife is pregnant and the pre-cogs live happily ever after. It's far too neat and tidy, especially for what's supposed to be a gritty thriller.Another regard in which the film is a disappoint is the action. You've got silly jetpack fights, dull fistfights (the Cruise/Farrell fight in the factory is a snoozer) and a computery sequence where Anderton superhumanly jumps from speeding car to speeding car. Plus the action is often punctuated with broad humour. During the jetpack fight the characters crash through ceilings and walls where people are obliviously going about their daily lives (they don't seem to hear the tremendous racket) and at the end of the scene where Anderton escapes from the car he crashes into a yoga class where people are folded in half; the humour feels dim-witted and out place. But the most ludicrous use of humour is when Anderton chases after his eyeballs. In another film it could have been quite funny, but again here it's misplaced.The eyes remind me of another problem: the many plot holes. I mean, how come Anderton can get back into the police station after being identified as someone who's going to commit a murder? Surely the first thing that would happen would be that his security clearance would be revoked. And then later his wife uses the eyes to get into the prison to free her husband. It's lazy plotting.Just as lazy is the way that Lamar (Max von Sydow) reveals his guilt to Anderton's wife. She mentions a murder and then Lamar, supposedly not knowing anything about the murder in question, mentions drowning even though he hasn't been told as such. It's the way that criminals reveal themselves in Murder, She Wrote and Columbo. It shouldn't happen in a film of this calibre.Thankfully, though, for every bad thing in the film there's something good. The pre-crime murders (especially the opening one with the scissors) are superbly filmed (as is the arrest), the scene with the electronic spiders is excellent (I like the overhead shot of all the rooms as the spiders methodically go about their work), the nightmarish eye operation and subsequent recuperation is terrific and the pre-crime advertisement ('I was going to be stabbed' 'Right here.') is suitably cheesy. I also like the cleverness of the murder that is disguised as an echo and the suddenness in which Lamar shoots Farrell's character. But even the ingenious murder doesn't necessarily stand up to scrutiny. There's an attempted murder, the woman is saved and then the police just walk off and leave her alone. Then Lamar pops up and kills her. I would have thought the police would have at least taken care of the woman and given her a lift back home after a close brush with death.But the film's biggest success is in portraying a perfect world that would actually be quite hellish to live in. The cops here are like the Thought Police. Suddenly you're being arrested for something you haven't done but something you're going to do. The whole system abolishes freedom of action. And while that may be good if you were going to be murdered by your spouse, it wouldn't be so good if you were intent on killing someone that had done great wrong to you  someone that was bribing you or abusing a loved one. Plus if a despot somehow entered the White House, any violent form of protest would be up that famous creek without a paddle.And the system in the film itself is pretty corrupt. They keep these three pre-cogs locked up in a chamber and pump them full of drugs so that they can continually suffer nightmarish visions. What an evil bunch of bastards.But the one thing I haven't mentioned is all the time paradoxes. And the reason I haven't mentioned them is because thinking about them makes me go cross-eyed",Null,4,7,27 November 2005
Friday Night Lights," Fantastic portrait of small town hell
","Small town life has always seemed rather miserable to me. The idealist would envisage it as a world of cookies and apple pie, of family values and kids playing softball. And this Shangri-La of hotdogs and cheeseburgers would be inhabited by golly-gee good-hearted folk, folk who look after their neighbours when they have cardiac arrest after their hearts swell with too much joy and love of life. And in each corner there would be a jock with a large chest and a cheerleader with a rack to match. But the reality has always seemed rather different. I can imagine a world full of losers and alcoholics, of broken dreams and smashed faces. Small town life isn't a piece of heaven. It's a piece of hell.And so it is in Friday Night Lights. Here you have a town that defines itself entirely by football. Education and culture be damned.The lack of interest in education is superbly illustrated in a series of calls on a radio show. They talk about the money that was spent on the football stadium. 'They say some of that money should have gone to the school.' 'Aint that stadium part of the school?' And then during game day the entire town empties. Everywhere you go you see signs saying, 'Gone to game.' The entire town invests its dreams and hopes in this football team and in the kids that play in it. It's a pathetic state of affairs.Of course this means that the kids that play are put under an extraordinary amount of pressure  pressure that they should never have to face so early on in their lives. Some react by internalising (Mike, the quarterback, rarely raises a smile) and some let it go to their heads (Boobie, the team's star player, is all mouth and swagger). But the frailty of this sort of existence is magnificently emphasised by the aforementioned Boobie. Right from the start you know his card is marked. He's cocky, he's talented and he says that his talent is god given. Therefore you know he's going to get injured. And his injury comes in the first game after he's forced into the match because a player loses his helmet. He should never have been on the field but suddenly his bright career is under threat. At the beginning it's kind of hard to find sympathy for the lad  there's a feeling of just desserts  but when the mask drops and he's reduced to a blubbering wreck because he'll never play football again, your heart goes out to him. Football was the one joy he had. It was the one thing he could excel in and it was his ticket out of this miserable town. But then out of nowhere it's taken away from him. And his future is bleakly summed up in one shot. He sits on the porch and he sees a bunch of garbage men. Not only is he now on the scrap heap but that's the sort of job he has to look forward to. He goes from having the world at his feet to being the rubbish that is scraped off the pavement.Also under pressure is the coach. Everywhere he goes people give him advice. And then people slag him off on the radio and people even threaten him when the possibility of defeat is raised. If the team loses, the town loses. The absurdity of this is best depicted in a scene where the team is forced into a tie-breaker and their future is decided by the flip of a coin. The whole town watches this on TV! This is what gives their life purpose and meaning. And it's amusing (and sad at the same time) that the coach gets paid more than the school principal. The small town people here have no faith in bettering themselves through education and knowledge. In Odessa betterment is measured by how many balls you catch, how many yards you rush and how many heads you bash.And the football here is superbly filmed. All the excitement is captured as well as all the crunching tackles (Boobie's injury is nasty, but I actually winced more when the quarterback gets his helmet kicked in his face). But I do have to say that I was disappointed when a bit of schmaltz found its way into the film in the final game. 'I love you all,' the teary quarterback says before the final play. But thankfully it's only a small moment and thankfully the actual end of the game is a pleasant surprise, one that goes against the grain of most sports movies.But then again, the film isn't really a sports movie as such. It's more a portrait of a town than a football team. And that's why the film works so well. It's about the desperation of having no way out. It's about the fleeting joy of actually doing something you love. And it's also about the despair that this might be as good as it gets. In the film there's an ex-football star who abuses his son. He chides him for not being good enough. But despite at first seeming like a one-dimensional alcoholic father (a character we've seen in millions of films) he reveals a misery that is all too real. He had one decent year in his life. One year that actually meant something. And from that point onwards it was downhill. He tells his son that he has one year to make some memories. It's a despairing sentiment, and one that might not apply to all the players, but for some, perhaps even most, it must ring true. Life isn't going to get any better than being a member of a high school football team. Holy crap, pass the gun.",Null,0,2,23 February 2006
Chinatown," A 70s masterpiece (spoilers throughout)
","Probably the most famous scene in Chinatown is the one where Jake Gittes gets his nose sliced. The punishment is poetic justice for a nosey private detective and one which serves as a stark warning for the character to keep his nose out of other people's business in the future. But of course Jake does nothing of the kind. His investigation becomes more determined. However, what he doesn't know is that by poking his nose in it, he'll destroy the woman he loves and help a corrupt millionaire.If there's a lesson to be learned from Chinatown it's that ordinary people are powerless against the greed and corruption of the wealthy. Powerful men can break the law with impunity, hold cities to ransom, destroy lives and never be held accountable. Ordinary people, on the other hand, are easily intimidated and powerless against petty bureaucracy. That's the way capitalism works. That's the system. Jake knows this. And he tries his best to keep out of it. Just take the Chinatown motif. There, in that community, it's best to keep your nose out of things because you don't know what's going on. And it's the same higher up in the system. To poke your nose into things is to open a can of worms and expose your ignorance. The only possible response to meddling is one of great hostility. But like all film noir, Jake just can't help getting involved. And like all film noir, a woman rouses Jake's interest.Mrs Mulwray is an interesting character because she goes against film noir tradition. She's introduced as the typical black widow, a cool, icy woman who will knowingly destroy the hero. But in actuality Mrs Mulwray is a sad, vulnerable woman. One who's forced to create a harsh façade to keep her dark secret under wraps. But underneath it she's a much warmer female character than you usually find in film noir. She's almost motherly. The way that she dresses Jake's nose certainly illustrates this, as does the lengths she goes to in order to protect her daughter. However, despite all this, she is a femme fatale. She certainly leads Jake to emotional ruin. But like much of the film, a mixture of crossed wires and blind ignorance drives events.It's a genre convention of film noir that the hero knows nothing and ends up ruining everything with his quest for the truth. And so it is with Chinatown. It's Jake who destroys Mrs Mulwray and it's Jake who unwittingly helps Noah Cross. By trying to find out of the truth of their lives he reconnects these two estranged individuals and instigates the inevitable conclusion. And as always in life, it's the powerful person who ends up winning.However, Mrs Mulwray has a part to play in her fate. It's Jake who reconnects her with her father, but it's her secrecy that fires his passion to discover the truth. If she'd told him everything earlier, such a tragic ending would have been avoided. But that's noir for you. Everyone's got their secrets and everyone holds onto them tightly. That's the fun of the genre. But even though the ending is inevitable, it's absolutely perfect. It couldn't have ended any other way. But although the ending is perfect in the sense that everything feels right about it, it's not filmed perfectly. The choreography between Nicholson and the cops before they shoot Mrs Mulwray should have been a lot better. If you watch it, it seems as if Lopez (playing Escobar) is waiting for Jack to tackle him. The timing is off. And the cop that steps forward to shoot at the car does it rather too theatrically in my opinion. It's a shame because it's the only mistake in the film. I really can't find any other faults. The story is magnificent, the dialogue is great, the acting is superb, the photography is luscious and I love the musical score and the production design. I just wish the choreography at the end were tighter and more natural.Another thing that I love about Chinatown is John Huston. He's such a perfect embodiment of evil. He's good company and extremely charming, but he has malevolence running through his veins. And I like the subtly insulting way that he pronounces Jake's surname. He wants to come across as a harmless, perhaps slightly barmy old man, but he knows exactly what he's doing. Everything is coldly calculated. And he also captures the attitude of corporate America. Why spend a lot of money building a safe dam when you can shave costs at the expense of safety and lives? Everything is about money. Well, money and power. Oh, and the future too. He wants to shape the new Los Angeles. He wants to control it. Unlike his former partner Hollis Mulwray, who's attitude, if anything, was socialist. He wanted the people to own the water, and therefore the new city. But that sort of idea is abhorrent to Cross. He represents the ethos that won the battle to control America. The capitalists took everything. And as the argument in the barbershop shows, there's a perverse respectability to greed in America. A banker is respectable, but a private detective isn't. In essence people aren't interested in the truth. They certainly don't want it plastered across the newspaper while they're having their breakfast. All they want is to make money and be left alone. Jake should have known that when he begun his investigation.",Null,3,7,9 August 2005
The Big Lebowski," The Deadbeat Lebowski
","How can anyone not dig The Dude? In a world where energetic go-getters are idolised and looked up to, it's nice to know that there are fat, indolent, scruffy, pot smoking, beer drinking bums out there taking it easy. Or they would be if people would leave their rugs alone The Big Lebowski is a film where the plot is entirely inconsequential; it doesn't matter. It's just a mere device to set The Dude on his way. The joy is in watching him interact with all the weirdos in Los Angeles and in listening to the dialogue  the script is the most quotable since Withnail and I. Therefore it's the perfect film to just sit back and absorb.Picking a favourite scene in a film that is jam packed with great moments and wonderful lines of dialogue is a near impossibility, but you'd be hard pressed to beat the scene with the Malibu police chief. 'I don't like your jerk-off name. I don't like your jerk-off face. I don't like your jerk-off behaviour. And I don't like youjerk-off.' And then to cap it off he throws his mug at The Dude's head. Brilliant! And making it even funnier is the scene that immediately follows it where the taxi driver throws The Dude out of his cab.But another favourite is Jesus. He only has two scenes but both are hilarious. (I hope the Coens make 'The Passion of the Jesus.') And I love the flashback where you see him knocking on doors to tell his neighbours that he's a pederast. Especially good is the way that a large, bearded man with a dirty shirt answers the door (I always crack up at the breath Jesus takes when he sees the man  I also noticed, for the first time, that Jesus in that flashback is visibly showing in his tight jeans; he's not a small guy).But then there's the scene where The Dude first meets Maude Lebowski (excellently played by Julianne Moore). 'I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but' And I also like the little dig at the porno film they're watching: 'The plot is ludicrous.' But the comment isn't really aimed at the porno film; the film is talking about itself. It knows the plot is nonsensical but it also knows that it doesn't matter  it's best to just let it wash over you.Mentioning porno has reminded me of Jackie Treehorn. Is there a better visual gag in modern cinema than The Dude scratching a notepad for a message or telephone number only to find a cartoon of a man with a gigantic erection? Well, maybe there is, because even earlier in the film there's the moment where The Dude spends a long time making a homemade device to keep intruders out only for him to forget the fact that his door opens outwards instead of inwards  he nails a bit of wood to the floor, props a chair up to the door handle to keep people out and the very second he walks away, the door opens and the chair comes tumbling down. Pure genius! And Jackie Treehorn's brainless goons are brilliant too. 'You're not dealing with morons here.' Oh yes we are. But the film's all the better for it.But I'm not sure what my favourite line in the film would be  again it's almost impossible to pick just one. But 'I still jerk-off manually' would have to be up there, as would virtually every line Walter spews ('The Chinaman is not the issue'). However, if I was forced (at gunpoint) to choose, I'd have to go with a piece of Dude wisdom: 'Fortunately, I'm adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regiment to keep my mind, you know, uh, limber.' And The Dude's reaction when Maude tells him that she's trying to conceive is magnificent.Yet another brilliant scene is the Larry scene. Walter and The Dude are trying to get information out of some kid but the kid just stares impassively at them, so Walter destroys his car  or what he thinks is his car. Now at this moment I could quote the real dialogue, but the TV version dialogue is perhaps even better. 'Do you see what happens, Larry? Do you see what happens when you find a stranger in the Alps?' It's even better than: 'Fun you, melon farmer!' Then there are the nihilists. 'We believe in nothing, Lebowski. Nothing. And tomorrow we come back and we cut off your johnson.' But try as they might to intimidate, the only scary thing about the nihilists is the techno music they listen to. Well, that and their obsession with the male member.But I could quote lines from The Big Lewbowski all day. I just dig the film so much because it puts a goofy grin on my face; its stupidity is remarkably intelligent. Plus, in the end, it's actually quite heartfelt  if the film's about anything, it's about friendshipwell, that and smoking pot, drinking beer, bowling and keeping hold of your johnson. Yeah, the world's a better place with The Dude in it.",Null,43,76,5 October 2005
Memento," Groundhog Day with murder (spoilers throughout)
","Lenny is kind of like a goldfish. His memory doesn't last too long and he keeps wandering haphazardly from one place to another. However, unlike a goldfish he has a gun and he wants to kill the man that killed his wifewhich is nice.Memento is a revenge thriller with no hope for catharsis and no hope for the protagonist to lead a fulfilling life after he gains his bloody vengeance. After all, according to Hollywood, once you get your revenge you're free to begin a new rewarding life  a bullet cures all ills. But Lenny is trapped. He's trapped in his own head and in a never-ending quest. Every day is the same. It's Groundhog Day with murder.What I like most about Memento is how hollow it shows revenge to be. Like most people I'd be more than happy to return violence against me with violence, but despite the desire to right wrongs, all too often it consumes people. Lenny is an extreme example. His injury makes catharsis impossible, ensuring that he's consumed by an unsolvable puzzle, but it also works as a metaphor. Revenge can all too often become people's lives. In the end the need for justice or retribution defines the person  it's all they are  and they get trapped in a viscous cycle. They can't be happy until they get their revenge and if/when they do they cease to have a reason to live.In light of this, perhaps Lenny has it made. His quest will never end and he'll always have a purpose. But this glib analysis ignores the dark fate that awaits Lenny. He has no chance for happiness, he has no chance to move on and he has no chance of closure. All he'll ever remember will be his wife being killed. But even if he can take a photo and convince himself that he's got his revenge he'll never have a chance to enjoy it after the deed is done. His will be a hollow victory.However, despite the futility of Lenny's quest, the end of the film is still rather satisfying. Only for a limited time does Lenny have access to all the facts, and rather take away the one thing that gives his life meaning, he gives himself a new puzzle to solve. It's a dark ending and one that finally sheds light on what has come before, but much more than that, it says something quite profound about the human mind and how we manage to survive even when everything is against us. For a brief time Lenny's world is falling apart around him, but rather than allow himself to forget what he's been told, he exploits his own weakness to perpetuate his revenge. The cycle will continue, but in a bizarre, twisted way, justice will be done One of the biggest surprises in Memento is the strength of Carrie-Ann Moss' performance. The Matrix films didn't really demand too much of her or test her acting skills, so I was pleasantly surprised to see her turn in an excellent performance as the horrid Natalie. Her best scene has to be her verbal assault on Lenny. It's smart, it's bad-mouthed and it had my blood boiling. In a single exchange you see the fallibility of the film's hero. Yes he may be able to write notes and tattoo is body, and he may think he knows the facts, but he can't protect himself against the manipulation of other people. He has no chance to analyse, to ruminate or to read people's character. He can only go on first impressions and the lacklustre notes he makes for himself  everything else is lost. And as he proves with his Sammy Jankis story, he's not as good as he thinks he is when it comes to reading people.But while Natalie's treatment of Lenny is ruthless, there are hints that she at least has some sympathy for him. For instance, when he talks about his wife she does look rather sorry for him. But then again, perhaps it's nothing. However, although she exploits him to the furthest degree, I don't think that Natalie is a clear-cut villain. I think she does feel sorry for Lenny, but I don't think that she lets that get in the way of her getting her own revenge. (What a perfect crime; getting a person with no memory to kill the person you want dead.) Stylistically, too, the film is superb. The film opens backwards and with a picture gradually getting fainter. Right from the beginning you're in the character's head. I also like the way that the past is in black and white. It suggests that the past is clear, certain. But as the film progress you realise that this might not be the case. Everything is open to doubt. The memory is incredibly fallible and the only certainty is that Lenny will never be free.",Null,2,5,29 June 2005
Alien: Resurrection," Alien Crucifixion (spoilers throughout)
","I don't care what most people say, Alien 3 is a damn good film. It's dark, it's gritty and it's refreshingly downbeat. It was a damn good end to the Alien trilogy. Unfortunately though, because of the negative reaction to the film and the desire to make some more cash out of a potentially lucrative franchise, Alien Resurrection got made. And boy is it bad.Right from the very first second it's obvious you're watching a turkey. The music is terrible, the special effects are sub-par and the visual style reminds me of The Fifth Element  a film I hate with all my heart. Then you have the awful Star Trek costumes and soldiers who look like they're holding toy guns. It's a comic book.What I like most about the original trilogy is the way that despite being set in the future and despite being about aliens with acid for blood, the environments felt realistic. The Nostromo felt like a living breathing spaceship, the colony in Aliens felt authentically low-tech and the prison planet in Alien 3 was grim and dirty. Alien Resurrection, though, feels like exactly what it is, a film. Not once could I suspend my disbelief. The sets look like sets (something that should never happen) and you can just imagine them filming in some large hanger and then someone shouting 'Cut!' The environments are horribly artificial. They're TV quality.Then there are all the pointless gimmicks. Not one of them works, whether it be the breath identification, the metal detector gloves (more cheap TV sci-fi), the ship's computer being called Father just because it's oh-so clever in light of the computer in Alien being called Mother (Father, by the way, sounds like Stephen Hawking), the spitting Aliens or the bastard creation that is the Newborn. And speaking of the Newborn, how in the hell did that get past the design stages? It looks like hunchback yellow turd with a potbelly and National Geographic tits. It's not in the least bit scary and the attempts to humanise it are hilarious. I'm supposed to have sympathy for its demise? Sorry, I could only sit there laughing my head off.But the Aliens in Resurrection aren't much better either. They all look like someone has blown their nose on them. They're covered in too much slime and gunk. And then, like the Newborn, there are the depressingly stupid attempts to try and give them character and to try and make the audience feel sympathy for them. Do I care that two aliens decide to kill one of their own? No, of course not.But what about the characters? Well, the film doesn't have much time for them and neither do I. Every single one is a cardboard cut out. You've got the evil corporate/military guy, the supposedly lovable rogues and the character who turns out to be a robot. Haven't we been over all of this before? And Ripley is a waste of space too. Sure Weaver tries her best to give her character layers, and she has a bit of fun being bad, but Whedon's script is so thin that it all comes off as a bunch of soundbites, or trailer moments as I call them. 'I heard you run into these things before. What did you do?' 'I died.' Ooh, pithy! But I guess that's what happens when you give writing duties to a fanboy and the creator of the hideously adolescent Buffy the Vampire Slayer. However, to be fair to Weaver, although perhaps not to Whedon, Ripley does have one good scene, the one where she kills one of her clones. It's the only scene with genuine feeling. Too bad then that it ends with more dire-logue  'It must be a chick thing.' In light of these multiple atrocities, I hoped that at least the action would be a welcome distraction. It isn't. The worst offender has to be the basketball scene. As if the fight isn't bad enough with its brief burst of techno music (I can't adequately express how awful the musical score is), there's the shoot-out with its toy guns and the ridiculous ricocheted shot. It's yet more comic book crap. And the underwater scene, while a good idea on paper, fails to get the blood pumping. In fact, the only thing I kept thinking during the whole scene was, 'Boy, they can hold their breath for a long time.' Oh, but the worst moment in the film, worse even than the Newborn, has to be when a man with an Alien inside him, who's convulsing, and who indeed gets shot three or four times as he's walking and giving 'birth', manages to punch the shooter in the face, disarm him and brutally beat him up. It's obviously meant to be crowd-pleasing moment, but the only people it's going to please are morons.But there are many other moronic things in the film. There's the way Ripley has acid for blood yet apparently has a normal physiology. There's the way that Ripley uses her blood as a convenient way to get her out of tricky situations (she's a galactic James Bond). There's the way that the company, the real bad guys in the series, are disposed of. There's the way that grown adults refer to the aliens as 'nasties' and 'monsters'. There's the way that Call inexplicably has a sample of the General's breath (how did she get that?). There's the way that Call gets shot, falls into the water and miraculously reappears. There are the Taxi Driver-style electronic holsters that one of the characters wears. And there are the amusingly awful moments of ultra-violence  the General saluting and then picking his own brain, the baby alien shooting through the bloke's head, the Newborn biting someone's head off and the Newborn squeezing someone's face off. Way to crucify a once great series.",Null,1,2,12 July 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Mediocre (spoilers)
","It's a sad indictment of modern mainstream cinema when Pirates of the Caribbean becomes a smash hit. Now that's not to say it's a terrible film  it's entirely watchable. No, it's just that it's so mediocre.What hurts the film most is the casting of its hero and heroine. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are just incredibly bland. They're two actors who although not entirely incompetent (thus denying us the opportunity to laugh our arses off as we point and jeer at the screen) have no serious acting chops. But worse than that they have no charisma. There's no charm, no allure and no sex appeal. I mean, sure Knighley is easy on the eye and I'm sure girls cream themselves silly at Bloom's squinty little eyes and paedophile moustache, but they're almost entirely lifeless  there's nothing going on behind the eyes. And Knightley's presence is made even more unwelcome by the fact that she plays a prissy, self-righteous, wholesome bore who squeals all her dialogue at a decibel level so great it explodes eardrums. Seriously, Will Turner deserves her. He can look forward to a lifetime of high-pitched nagging and refusal of sex.But Knightley's worst moment (and the film's worst moment) is when she hits a pirate while uttering the following line, 'You like pain? Try wearing a corset.' You know, because men don't know pain. And because wearing a corset is far worse than having your arm lopped off with a sword; or having a leg blown to kingdom come from canon fire; or having a sweaty, leering, corpulent, well-endowed seadog make you his rear admiral with all the supplies of lubricant run dry. And that cheesy line is made even worse because it's spoken by a woman so weedy, so skinny, so under-nourished that it's debatable that she could pick up the plank she hits the pirate with without regurgitating in exhaustion the kiddie-sized bowl of muesli she gorged on for dinner. Yeah, she's an empowered woman. She's pretty, she can kick ass and she's got a waist thinner than a tube of Pringles. (The politically correct 'empowering' of women also extends to one of the ships being captained by a black woman. I know it's just a kid's film and the mores of today are shoehorned into an earlier time, but couldn't the 'empowered' women actually resemble real women and not be bland model types who either squeal like anorexic harridans or screech a 'talk to the hand' brand of sass that's more suited to Jerry Springer?) But I shouldn't be too tough on Knightley. Bloom's equally culpable. Just take the way he scrunches his forehead and squints his eyes when he has to communicate thought; or when he makes a passionate speech that's about as rousing as a punch in the groin; or when he wetly communicates his love for Miss Swan. If Luke Skywalker is a limp piece of lettuce, Will Turner is a flaccid one-inch penis.And exacerbating the blandness is the casting of Jack Davenport. He's meant to be the pencil-necked Poindexter that does everything by the rules, but he plays his role too well. It's like watching an invisible man. His character is totally devoid ofanything.But if Bloom, Knightley and Davenport are the schmoly trinity, then Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Jonathan Pryce, Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg are the quintet that makes the film worth watching (I also like the two dumb soldiers). Enough people have expounded the joys of Depp's Keith Richards-inspired performance, but Rush actually makes me laugh more anyway. There's a fantastic bit during a swordfight where he walks along shouting 'Aaaaarrrr!' And he also does the same thing while chasing Knightley. It's a clichéd pirate played with absolute glee. And Pryce is great, too. Admittedly he doesn't get to do much, but he makes up for everything in a moment near the end. After the British defeat the pirates he emerges from the room he's locked himself in and he proceeds to finger wag and shadow box the marauders. It just shows what a good actor is capable of; how an actor with wit and personality can make a small moment memorable.But contrary to popular opinion, the film actually belongs to the duo of Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg as a pair of knuckleheaded pirates. Every time they're on the screen the film is suddenly about a million times more fun. And I like the way the two are portrayed as something of a married couple. They finish each other's sentences and get on each other's nerves. And I also like the way the film wryly questions their sexuality. Take the scene where they have to dress up as women as they act as a decoy in a rowing boat. Crook tells his pal that he looks nice and a scuffle ensues. Funny stuff.Unfortunately, though, while some of the interplay between the supporting characters is fun to watch, the action is rather uninspired. And it's not helped by the fact that all the pirates (and Johnny Depp) are immortal. Therefore you have to endure swordfights that have zero tension because there's absolutely nothing at stake. And action seems to take up the entire final third of the film. As a consequence it becomes something of a snoozer. But fortunately the photography and production design is first rate. So at least you get something nice to look at while swords clatter ad nauseam.",Null,1,2,29 June 2006
Batman Returns," Burton's best stab at Batman (spoilers)
","There's no doubt in my mind that Batman Returns is better than Tim Burton's first stab at making a film about the dark knight. Batman Returns is sharper, tighter, darker and, most importantly, more entertaining than its predecessor. In every regard it trumps the previous film.One of things that surprises me about Batman Returns is that none of the villains is entirely evil. Of course it's nothing new to have the tragic villain, but often films are quite heavy-handed in their attempt to garner sympathy for their antagonists. But here the film's villains are almost overwhelming wicked. They're greedy, they're murderous and they're power hungry. But yet weirdly, each one has a touch of humanity. Shreck, the immoral businessman, the man who's probably the most wicked of them all, sacrifices himself so that his square-jawed son won't die. Of course, this is probably out a narcissistic desire to ensure that his seed doesn't disappear in the ether, but nonetheless he still performs a selfless act. Then there's The Penguin. He blackmails, he murders and he even plans to drown lots of children, but yet you feel he has a right to be angry. He's been betrayed and thrown away like he's a piece of trash by his parents  no wonder he's messed up. And of course Catwoman has lots of shades of grey.And it's perhaps Catwoman who is the most interesting character. Here you have a woman who is a doormat. Every man in her life walks all over her. The reason for this seems to be her repressed sexuality  her apartment is full of dollhouses, pink t-shirts with kittens on them and cuddly toys. She seems almost sexless. No wonder no one looks at her when she expresses herself in such an infantile way. But once Catwoman is born, all of those things are thrown away and destroyed. And the scene where she does this is one of the best in the film. It's filmed with complete rage  she's violently discovering herself and her sexuality, and all the childlike accoutrements of the past are smashed into pieces. She's no longer going to be walked on.And for the rest of the film she schizophrenically alternates between good and evil. She helps a mugging victim but then berates her, she helps concoct a plot to frame Batman but then momentarily baulks when someone gets killed, and she wants to pursue a relationship with Bruce Wayne but can't accept the idea of a happy ending. She can't reconcile the two parts of her personality  her sexual needs and her need to be happy and content.A character who is less conflicted about his sexuality is The Penguin. I love the way he's portrayed as an oversexed lech. In one scene he eagerly pins a button to a young woman's blouse, leering at her breasts and in another he leers at a campaign worker's bum, saying that he'd like to fill her void. It's wonderfully perverted. And then there's the way that Max Shreck convinces The Penguin to become Mayor. He promises him unlimited poontang. Everything else fails to fire The Penguin's imagination, but this changes his mind. And then there's the moment where he meets Catwoman. 'Just the pussy I've been looking for.' The film is incredibly oversexed.And it's telling that even though Bruce Wayne and Batman get comparatively little screen time, his scenes in this film are much more interesting than those in the first film. I mean, his relationship with Vicki Vale was uninteresting in the extreme, but there's actually something weirdly tragic about his relationship with Selina Kyle/Catwoman. Both know that they'll never be content. But although this all sounds pretty heavy, there's also some wonderful humour. There's a great little scene in Bruce Wayne's mansion when Selina asks that Alfred the butler think of a dirty limerick to tell Bruce  she doesn't want Bruce to think that she's rejecting him. 'One has just sprung to mind,' is Alfred's response.But all of the humour in the film is gloriously black. One of my favourite lines occurs when Max Shreck is threatening Selina  he's caught her going through his protected files. 'It's not like you can just kill me,' she says. 'Actually, it's a lot like that,' Shreck replies. And then he plays with her, by going to kiss her and then laughing before pushing her out of the window. The film has a black heart, and I personally think that's great.But as black as the film's heart is, there are also a couple of beautiful moments. I personally love The Penguin's death. He rises from the water like a monster and then with a glorious cue from Danny Elfman, he goes to kill Batman and accidentally picks a cute umbrella instead of a deadly one. He then collapses flat on his face and dies. And then if that isn't enough, a group of penguins emerge and tenderly lead him to a watery grave. No attempt is made to water the character down, to make him more likable, but you still can't help but feel for him, which is kind of an extraordinary feat for the filmmakers.The other moment I really love is when Batman is called at the start. The Bat sign shines bright through Bruce Wayne's mansion, casting light on his dark study. It's a very economical way of showing that this is all that gives his life meaning  before the sign shines through his window he's motionless in the dark. So while people accuse Burton's Batman films of being shallow (I certainly think that's the case when it comes to the first one), it's a less valid criticism of the sequel. As well as the beautiful production design and cinematography, there's plenty to get your teeth into. You can't just expect it to be handed to you on a plate.",Null,0,0,3 January 2008
Hot Fuzz," Hot Stuff (spoilers)
","The trouble with the British police is that they're not very sexy. Just compare them to the Americans. The Americans get guns; we get truncheons. The Americans wear caps; we wear helmets that resemble breasts. The Americans get NYPD Blue, Hill Street Blues and Miami Vice; we get Dixon of Dock Green, Z-Cars and The Bill. There's an imbalance there, one that Hot Fuzz fully recognises.The beginning of Hot Fuzz presents us with a cop called Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) who has the best arrest record in his station (400% better to be exact). But while in America this would be a cause for admiration and pats on the back, here it's bad form. He's making everyone else look bad. So therefore he's sent to the country, to a place that has no crime and a place that has won the village of the year competition.One of the funniest scenes occurs quite early on when Angel is new to the town. He goes to the pub and slowly realises that most of the drinkers are underage. Unable to switch off and let it pass, he begins to interrogate the kids. 'When's your birthday?' he asks one youth. '22nd February.' 'What year?' 'Every year.' 'Get out.' I love the kid's sarcasm and Angel's disgusted reaction. And then even better, he asks the same question to a geeky, bespectacled kid. Rather than make up a phoney date, the kid can only squeal in horror. He's then thrown out. It's silly humour, but it works.Another silly piece of humour I enjoyed occurs even earlier than the pub scene. After being transferred, Angel visits his girlfriend, who's a crime scene investigator. Therefore, when he visits her as she's working, she's wearing a white jumpsuit and mask. 'Jeanine, I've been transferred,' he says. 'I'm moving away for a while.' 'I'm not Jeanine,' comes the reply, in a man's voice. And then Angel, after having the real Jeanine pointed out to him, repeats the dialogue. It's a piece of Naked Gun humour (a film that I love).Even sillier, though, and generating an even bigger laugh from me, is a late scene between Angel and PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost, funny as ever). It's an earnest turning point scene, a scene that happens in virtually every buddy cop film. In this case, Danny is trying to get his pal to leave the village so that he doesn't get hurt. 'Go back to Lond-on,' he says. Words just can't do it justice, but I honestly thought Frost's line delivery was the best thing in the film. I also love the line: 'He's not Judge Judy and executioner'.On the other hand, some of the broader humour doesn't work quite as well. Fair enough, it's brilliant when Angel dropkicks a shotgun-wielding granny, but the shoot-out scenes lose their charm pretty quickly. Maybe it's because they're too similar to recent action films they're mimicking. I just can't stand that jerky, over-edited style of action. It gives me brain ache.Having said this, the action does recover towards the end with one of the main villains (excellently played by Timothy Dalton) getting speared through the chin by the spire of a model church. It's magnificently over the top.Also worthy of big laughs are the numerous killings. With people getting decapitated, stabbed in the throat with shears, and best of all, spiked in the head by church masonry, you have enough blood to fill a dozen horror films. But while it's a surprise how violent Hot Fuzz is (much more so than the current brand of watered down action flicks), it's a pleasant surprise. I'm personally all for heads being exploded in geysers of blood. There should be more masonry-related violence.But back to the film's silly humour, just as funny as these blood-filled 'big' moments is a tiny moment when Angel and Danny are talking to their rivals in the CID. They're arguing and squabbling and the two detectives move out of frame, but then Paddy Considine moves his head back into the shot. It's one of those things that has to be seen, but it's one of the best bits in the film.However, as good as the film is, I do have to say that there are sections where the film drags. Occasionally there are large gaps between laughs. Part of this is because the film actually has a plot  from time to time there's quite a bit of exposition - and part of it is because the film feels a little long. You feel it could have been tightened.But none of this seriously affected my enjoyment of the film. And it's also worth noting that behind all the wonderfully dumb jokes and bad taste humour, there's a bit of social commentary. The village society in this film, after all, kills anyone that doesn't conform to their standards of behaviour  gypsies, teenagers and hoodies are popular targets. Therefore the film seems to be slyly attacking the parochial attitudes of middle class England. For all the overt violence of London you have a more insidious type of violence existing in certain parts of the country and amongst certain people. But whether this message makes an impact is debatable. There's too much other stuff going on, most of it involving guns, decapitation and silly one-liners...which is fine by me.",Null,1,2,5 July 2007
Troy," Mediocre Troy story (spoilers throughout)
","Troy is an incredibly mediocre film. It neither offends nor inspires. Instead it leaves you feeling like an opportunity's been wasted  the money is there, but the will and the talent are sadly missing.Apart from the leaden script and nondescript direction, the film's main deficiency is Orlando Bloom. The man has always been a hopeless actor, but here he plumbs new depths, turning in a performance that is based entirely on puppy eyes, simpering looks and flat line delivery. The man is wholly incapable of emoting. Although, to be fair, he is lumbered with a near impossible part  the snivelling Paris. Even the most talented actor would have a hard time bringing such a wretched person to life. But seeing as Bloom is among the least talented actors in Hollywood, it makes the character all the more unbearable.The most infuriating thing about Paris is the way he stumbles through the story, causing nothing but trouble, and yet he ends up killing the mighty Achilles and smelling of roses. Perhaps in more talented hands, this would have been fine, but here it makes you question why you watched the film. This pathetic loser condemns thousands of people to death (including his brother and father) so that a blonde strumpet can play with his winkie. Brilliant! It's hard to pick a single scene that had me baying for Paris' blood (there are so many), but his most cowardly act comes during his fight with Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson). He's meant to fight to the death, ignorantly thinking that this skirmish will prevent further bloodshed. But even with his honour and the lives of his countrymen at stake, he runs away like a big baby and hides behind his brother. What a pathetic excuse for a human being. I share Menelaus' outrage when he exclaims to Helen that this is what she left him for.And the scenes between Paris and Helen are nauseating. The two actors have zero chemistry and both have the screen presence of a couple of fruit flies. Do we care about their all-consuming love? Of course not. It's played like a couple of kids who have just discovered that their genitals are there for more than secreting waste material.And speaking of Helen, isn't she supposed to be the most beautiful woman in the world? Instead we get your average foreign starlet with too much mascara and a larger than average schnoz. Sure any man in his right mind would tap it, but start a war over her? Forget about it.In fact, a lot of the guys in the film are just as pretty as Helen. Just take the numerous ass shots we get of Brad Pitt. Then you have Achilles' cousin. He's your typical blonde-haired dreamboat. And is it any wonder that the only thing that truly enrages Achilles is the death of his beloved cousin, a cousin who he frequently engages in some light-hearted sword fighting with? But even though the film fetishes the male form (as well as a zillion shots of Pitt's toned butt, we also get to see an oiled Orlando Bloom  he's completely hairless of course), it's strictly a torso and arse film  no tits or willies.But while the film fails spectacularly in terms of romance, character development and inter-personal relationships, it succeeds when it comes to action. The fight between Hector and Achilles, in particular, is superb. With lots of close contact and athleticism, it thankfully resists the urge to become overly fanciful. Instead you get something that feels pure and believable.Another excellent fight scene is the one between Hector and Ajax. Again things are kept simple and the sequence benefits from it. I also enjoyed the fight between Paris and Menelaus  the camera in the helmet is an excellent way of generating fear and claustrophobia  but unfortunately its somewhat spoiled by Paris' cowardly actions. As is the final sequence where Achilles is slain. Here you have a character you're finally starting to like and he's cut down by a skinny imbecile with a bad curly haircut.That reminds me, what's up with the haircuts in this film? All the men seem to have these weird semi-mullets  Sean Bean, Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom especially. And then you have Brian Cox and Brendan Gleeson who seem to have acquired Gary Oldman's bizarre tit-head hairstyle from Francis Ford Coppola's version of Dracula. It's actually rather distracting  I spent a lot of time looking at people's heads; the haircuts here are worse than the ones you see on a football pitch.But as bad as his haircut is, I did enjoy Brian Cox in this film. Sure he's hammier than a ham sandwich, but at least he seems to be having some fun with it. I also think that Eric Bana is pretty damn good  the film suffers badly when his character dies; Hector is the heart and soul of the movie. However, I think Pitt's performance is less successful. He's great in the action scenes, but everywhere else he seems out of place.However, I like the idea of Achilles being a celebrity, a man who wants to further his own image at the expense of everything else. But as it is, this element of the story, like all the other ideas, isn't developed enough. The film aims low and scores small.",Null,34,61,14 March 2007
Brokeback Mountain," Should have won the Oscar (spoilers)
","The 2006 Best Picture Oscar was contested, primarily, by two 'issue' pictures  one dealing with race, the other dealing with homosexuality. But while one used a heavy-handed approach to deal with its subject, the other told its story with skill and restraint. The heavy-handed film won.Brokeback Mountain is always going to be derisively referred to as 'that gay cowboy movie' by the people who are predisposed towards disliking it, but even though people aren't used to male homosexuality being portrayed on the big screen in a non-comic way, it's really not a very revolutionary film - repressed love has been dealt with many times in cinema. But because it's two cowboys, the supposed embodiment of everything that is masculine, that are engaged in a passionate relationship, it takes on a novelty value and possesses a shock factor for those people who have been living under a rock and haven't realised that men have been bumming each other since the dawn of man. But thankfully the more worldly wise can just ignore the novelty and the supposed shock and enjoy a very good film.The opening part of the film is a tad slow (but not excessively so) and sees Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) working on Brokeback Mountain, looking after a farmer's livestock. There are no overt signs of their relationship developing into something more than it is, but all the time there are little hints. There are the sidelong glances; the look Ennis gives as he looks up at the mountain, perhaps contemplating his colleague; and the small smiles of satisfaction Ennis gives when Jack horses about. But rather than develop slowly over time, things explode one night in their tent. The sex scene that follows isn't loving or tender, it's violent. It's maybe years of frustration and repression being released. But the morning after, quite understandably, is awkward, and Ennis rides off to think about what happened. One of the first things he sees is a sheep that has been ripped apart by a coyote. The visual encapsulates his situation. All the time he's been a sheep  he doesn't stand out  but now his true nature has been revealed and violent repercussions are a definite possibility. (And later Ennis tells the story of how his dad showed him the dead body of a gay man when he was a kid. The man was beaten and then had his penis ripped off.) When Ennis and Jack next talk, Ennis declares that he's not queer (Jack says he isn't either). And they're both right. Calling someone queer is a way of saying someone's less of a man and less of a human being because they're attracted to their own sex. Such an assertion is ridiculous, but unfortunately a lot of people still think that way either out of ignorance or insecurity as regards their own sexuality. But Ennis and Jack, whatever their sexual orientation, are just men.And after the two finish on Brokeback Mountain they return to their lives. For Ennis this means getting married (Jack gets married also). But although both have a crack at leading 'normal' lives they can't change how they feel and meet again. And the scene where they're reunited is a powerful one. The two guys meet outside Ennis' place, but seeing as they're out in the open, neither knows how to respond. But when they retreat to a corner where they think no one can see, they're watched by Ennis' wife. For them it's a moment of joy, but for her it's devastating  her world is shattered. And it's to the film's credit that it treats Ennis' wife so evenly. She doesn't become a bitter, vindictive woman, but at the same time she doesn't become a victim. The film never takes the easy way out.But eventually the marriage deteriorates to the point that the couple get divorced (by the end Ennis only sleeps with his wife to procreate). And after that you have an excellent scene where the estranged family have Thanksgiving dinner. It's so awkward because Ennis' ex has a new husband. Everything is bubbling under the surface. And sure enough, in the kitchen, Ennis' ex admits that she knows about his homosexuality and a scuffle ensues.But Jack has his own domestic hell to deal with, too. His father-in-law shows him no respect and interrupts their dinner to put a football game on the television for Jack's son to watch. 'We don't eat with our eyes,' he says. 'You want your son to grow up to be a man, don't you?' But Jack asserts himself and shows the stupid old geezer who the real man of the house is.However, as much as the two guys would rather be with each other than their loathsome relatives, they have to make do with monthly 'fishing' trips. Only here do they experience genuine contentment. But eventually even these meetings sour. They just aren't enough. And thusly the relationship between Ennis and Jack eventually falls apart.One of the film's final sequences sees Ennis, after Jack's death (and possible murder), visit Jack's parents. They're a wonderful bunch of scenes, which pick at all the different character's emotions. Mr Twist takes a couple of jabs at Ennis, hinting that Jack had a new 'friend' in a spiteful bid to hurt his guest, while Mrs Twist compassionately lets Ennis take a look around Jack's room. There Ennis finds a couple of shirts which he secretly hugs to his chest, and when he returns downstairs Mrs Twist gives him a bag to keep them in.

Insomnia," A solid thriller (spoilers)
","These days it's something of a novelty when Al Pacino turns in a performance that doesn't include a lot of SHOUTING. It's become his trademark; when all else fails shout, 'HOO-HA!' But seeing as he's playing a man who can't get any sleep in Nolan's film, he's forced to turn the volume down  although he still manages one or two shouts. This means that we get to see the more reserved Pacino. The one who portrayed Michael Corleone and Serpico, and the one who doesn't need to resort to cheap tricks to engage the audience. Having said that, though, part of me wishes there was a scene where Pacino suddenly blurts out 'HOO-HA!' to wake himself up, preferably in a public place or at a funeral I guess it must be quite a difficult task to make a film about insomnia and fatigue and not have the same effect on the audience. Sure you want the audience to be put in the place of Pacino's character, but you don't want them to fall asleep. So Nolan pulls off quite a trick by allowing you to feel that fatigue but without turning you off. The best way he does this is through the editing. All the time you get flashes. It's like that feeling when you fall asleep for a couple of seconds and then suddenly wake up. Another excellent technique is the way that Nolan occasionally exaggerates sounds  there's a scene in the police station where the fan rumbles more loudly than it should and where a stapler comes crashing down with a huge thud. And added to this you get distorted images like when you're desperately trying to stay awake. You close and rub your eyes and you're constantly refocusing on what you see. Nolan visualises that feeling superbly.Nolan also includes brief hallucinations. From time to time you see Pacino's dead partner in the present. Not only does this hint at his distorted perspective but it also gets into his guilty conscious. And the shooting of his dead partner is an excellent scene. The fog visualises how tired and morally confused Pacino is, and in the heat of the moment it's not at all clear that the man he's shooting at is his partner. It's only in flashbacks that the shooting becomes clearer. In the flashbacks you can see it's his partner before he gets shot  the fog seems to lift. I guess this could be taken two ways. Either he did mean to kill his partner or his guilty feelings are playing on him. Personally I think it's the later. I don't think he meant to kill his partner. I think it's his partner's reaction  his fear of Pacino as his dying  and the subsequent events combined with his fatigue that make him question himself. But it's to the film's credit that things are never completely spelt out.Where the film's more traditional is in the resolution. Pacino sins so he must die. But he also sacrifices himself so that justice can prevail. Perhaps in the wrong hands it could be a lousy ending  the original's is much more ambiguous  but I think it works pretty well. He certainly does the right thing. He not only prevents himself from falling into a moral vacuum but he stops Hilary Swank's character from emulating him. So it's a redemptive ending, and one that sounds corny on paper, but it works on screen. The performances and the directing prevent it from becoming cheesy.Another positive is Robin Williams. I much prefer him as a creep than I do as a comedian. In fact, most of his comedic films are awful  his stand-up makes me laugh and so do his chat show appearances, but his comedic films are frequently dross. So I'm always quite pleased when he plays someone insidious. He does it well. He can play creepy guys that are creepy because they're utterly banal. All too often people associate madness and danger with the Hannibal Lector school of acting. But if you watch programmes about serial killers they're usually dreary people. Their actions seem normal to them. So Williams gets the character spot on. He's a little dull, a little creepy but also fascinating to watch. The interest lies in how such a boring person can do such a thing. Of course he comes out with the usual reasons for killing  a girl laughs at his advances  and they almost sound understandable until you realise that they're not. It's kind of John Doe syndrome  'Yeah, I sort of understand thatNo, wait a minute, he's completely bonkers.' But although everyone tries their best to avoid clichés, the film does indulge in them from time to time. The scene between Pacino and Williams on the ferry, while good  it's strange seeing such two completely different actors acting together  is a bit familiar in the 'we're not so dissimilar' message it contains. But having said that, it's kind of nice seeing the two characters almost swap positions; Williams becomes like a detective and Pacino acts like the criminal. Another cliché is the useless local police force. But again, it's not so bad. Like most clichés it's a cliché because there's truth in it. And another cliché is the hero-worshipping rookie. But yet again, it's a cliché that feels honest and one that is well presented. In fact, all the clichés are well done  there's a lot to be said for clichés if they're executed properly.But watching Nolan's film has made me want to see the original again. I've only seen it once and that was quite a while ago. Therefore I can't remember much about it. About all I can remember is the main character being more unsympathetic. Whether that benefits it, I'm not sure, but it would certainly be hard to top Nolan's effort.",Null,0,0,21 September 2005
Match Point," London Woody (spoilers throughout)
","When it came out, Match Point was touted as a return to form for Woody Allen. It was meant to be one of his best films. Instead it's something of a disappointment, mostly because the two main stars perform so badly. Time after time amateurish acting spoils a possibly good scene. Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Scarlett Johansson are completely out of their depth.The worst scenes occur towards the end when the fiendish Meyers concocts a plan to kill his lover. They spend ages talking and arguing, and over and over again Scarlett, who's pregnant, tries to get Myers to leave his wife. But all Scarlett does is walk around, drinking and popping pills as she shrilly berates her beau, and Myers just tugs his hair and shouts. It's like a school play  the quality of acting is that poor.But you have to wonder what Meyers sees in the woman. Yes she's physically attractive, but her character is spoiled, selfish and whiny. Therefore I celebrated her murder at the hands of Meyers like he'd won Wimbledon. She really did deserve to be put out of her misery, screeching like a harridan at every moment and falling for Meyers' lies.I was just annoyed that Meyers didn't kill his wife as well, as she was just as bad, if not worse, than Scarlett. Played by Emily Mortimer she's a silly little rich girl who gets besotted by the handsome ex-tennis pro and is then arranging his life for him within a few minutes. She introduces him to her rich father, gets him a good job and tells him she wants a child. Meyers' life is being taken away from him. It's no longer his own.But although at first Mortimer seems nice, she turns out to be just as manipulative as Scarlett and Meyers. There's one scene where she's talking with her friends about the holiday they're all going on, and then she mentions that she once gave Meyers an ancient Greek fertility charm and put it under his pillow for two months but that she still isn't pregnant. It's a subtle humiliation, one with a smile. And earlier Mortimer makes fun of Meyers when he orders modestly at a restaurant and then jokingly refers to his poor upbringing. She's not meant to be making fun, but she is. And then even earlier she condescendingly says that her father is proud of the way he dragged himself up against the odds, meaning that they're indirectly calling him gutter-trash. Therefore you can't blame Meyers for seeking solace in someone else's arms.But unfortunately Meyers' misery is everlasting. He kills Scarlett and gets away with the crime, but as if this emotional torment isn't enough, he finally has a child with his wife and there's talk of having another. He's buried himself even deeper in his own private hell. An escape is even less likely, tied as he is to the money and comfort of his torpid lifestyle.And of course its ironic that this good luck of getting away with the crime means that Meyers has plunged himself even deeper into his misery. Consequently you know that the opening and ending adage that its better to be lucky than good is complete baloney. Being lucky has done nothing for this person. It's just made his existence even more painful and depressing.With all these themes running through the film and with all this meat to chew on, you'd think the film would be a pleasurable experience. But like I mentioned at the beginning, the poor acting spoils things. Apart from Meyers and Johansson, who are consistently disappointing, there are also the two cops at the end. They never convince. Although some of the blame should also be apportioned to the writing. The dialogue between the detectives is consistently hokey and there's even a moment where one of them sits up in his bed and proclaims to himself that he knows who did it. The corniness of it is overwhelming. I can't believe anyone in real life does that.Allen is much better at writing the idle banter of the rich. The characters here have nothing to contribute to the world. They're all selfish. They're all scum. And in a lot of scenes there's an upper class desperation that rings true. But because the acting from the two leads is so bad it's hard to get swept away by the film. I certainly don't need to like characters in order to enjoy a movie, but they need to be able to convince me that they exist in some alternate reality. Here, though, I was consistently pulled out of the film.An example of this is during the murder sequence. Meyers is skulking away in a stairwell and he hears a couple approaching. Fearing exposure, he hides in a corner. But watch his face. He suddenly pulls an incredibly camp expression. In that moment he looks like Kenneth Williams.And then you have the first encounter between Scarlett and Meyers. Scarlett's attempt at being sexy is to just pout and stare. There's little else going on behind the eyes. She fails to inhabit the skin of a character. Instead she just seems to be going through the motions.But even though Allen is crippled by his actors, he still manages to make the film reasonably enjoyable. It's nowhere near his best but it's certainly not among his worst. And there's also the novelty value of Allen filming in London. He has a bit of a tourist's eye and the characters live lifestyles that often seem beyond them  even if you do have loads of money, how much would it cost to have an apartment overlooking Parliament?  but it's good to see Allen try and stretch himself. He doesn't quite succeed, but with Meyers and Johansson cast in the central roles, I guess luck wasn't quite with him.",Null,2,3,27 June 2008
The Terminator," An action masterpiece? Wrong! (But a fine film regardless) (spoilers)
","When people criticise Terminator 2, they usually point out how annoying Edward Furlong is. Then they cite the 'thumbs up' and the dodgy robot sentimentality. And after this they point out how much tougher The Terminator is, as if it's devoid of corn. Are they forgetting what a drip Linda Hamilton is in this film ('guard it for me, big buns')? Are they overlooking how cheesy the romance between Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese is? Do they forget how embarrassing Sarah's flatmate is? None of this spoils my enjoyment of what is a great film, but the nitpicking of Terminator 2 and the concessions that are made to The Terminator baffle me somewhat  both are fantastic action movies, but both have their flaws.Watching it for the first time in years, the thing that made me laugh the most about The Terminator was the romantic relationship between the hero and heroine. In one scene Reese tells Sarah that he came through time for her ('coming' through time almost being literal, as his appearance in the film has him shaking, with steam pouring off him, like he's experienced an earth-shattering orgasm), and then after he admits to being a virgin, and to carrying a photo of her around with him, they have some tearful sex as a piano version of the title theme plays. Woah. So basically Reese has come through time to fulfil a masturbatory fantasy of popping his cherry with his boss's mum; a boss who is also, unbeknownst to him, his son? Well, I guess snatch is as good a reason as any to save the world.But the fact that Reese is a virgin makes me ponder what the resistance is doing in this post-apocalyptic world. Surely such a dire situation would call for prodigious breeding. Strapping young men would surely be required to service young ladies aplenty to help perpetuate the species and build the army (and what better release after fighting lots of gnarly robots?). But alas, from what I can gather, the human army doesn't have any such program. No wonder Reese had to travel through time  radiation-soaked poontang just hasn't got the same appeal as some good, clean 80s beaver.Joking aside, the central relationship, while sappy in its beginnings and embarrassing in its consummation, does work well for the final section of the film. Without it the final act would have just been a traditional action finale, with a predictable confrontation and lots of false endings. But because Cameron invests the film with some emotion  the actors somehow manage to cut through the cheese  it makes the Terminator's stalking of Sarah all the more terrifying, especially after Reese is killed. You're so used to her relying on him that she suddenly seems incredibly vulnerable and isolated, which makes her victory at the end more significant but rather hollow, too. The downbeat ending certainly works well for the film.But although some aspects of the romance aren't particularly convincing, at least they're less embarrassing than Sarah's flatmate Ginger and Ginger's boyfriend. These are characters we're meant to fall in love with; we're meant to weep for their tragic demise. But their dirty phone calls and big hair and Walkman sex (watch Ginger pouting and nodding as she turns the headphones up as her boyfriend begins pumping her) are so ridiculous that I couldn't help but cheer as the Terminator brutally slayed them. I only wished their deaths would have been more painful and prolonged.However, that's a big part of The Terminator  even though he's the bad guy, we're meant to get a kick out of Arnie killing people. And indeed we do. My favourite killing has to be that of the gun store owner. 'Which will it be?' the man asks. 'All', says Arnie. And then when Arnie begins loading one of his guns the man tells him he can't do that. 'Wrong' is Arnie's pithy reply. Wonderful! A close runner up to this is when the Terminator kills the first Sarah Connor. 'Sarah Connor?' he asks, and then when she replies 'Yes', he blows her away. Simple but effective, and further proof, if any was needed, not to answer the door if any strange Austrians in punk outfits come-a-calling, especially ones carrying concealed weapons.But as enjoyable as these individual slayings are, they kind of pale in comparison to the police precinct massacre. The men in blue get blown away left, right and centre, and secretly, everyone in the audience begins to cheer  a large part of The Terminator's appeal lies in a kind of wish fulfilment; we all wish that we could be as morally liberated as the Terminator; anyone who annoys us or gets in our way gets blown to kingdom come.Which reminds me of one of my favourite moments in the film. There's a bit where The Terminator is scanning Sarah Connor's address book. A cleaner stops outside and asks Arnie whether he's got a dead cat in there. The Terminator scans a few possible replies and then responds with 'F*** you, a******'. Oh what joy it must be to be an emotionless cyborg  profanities and threats can be thrown out without fear of repercussions.But I think Arnie deserves a hell of a lot of credit for the success of The Terminator. Sure Cameron's direction is excellent, and Hamilton and Biehn both do decent jobs, but it's the creepy image of an eyebrowless Schwarzenegger that makes the film so watchable. It may sound like an insult to say that Arnie is great at playing a robot, but it's true  his portrayal is scary, disturbing and completely convincing. Plus he has buns of steelquite literally (and a little willy, too, if you watch carefully  I guess you can't have everything).",Null,0,1,29 March 2007
Cloverfield," A cut above most monster movies (spoilers)
","Let's face it. Most monster movies are rubbish. Even the original King Kong leaves me cold, featuring as it does bland characters and atrocious dialogue. But wait, it features a massive ape tearing stuff apart. Isn't that, like, totally awesome, dude? No, not really.So does Cloverfield buck the trend of the rubbish monster movie? Well, it does and it doesn't. I mean, the characters here are amazingly bland. I cared for them not one bit. And the dialogue is serviceable at best. It's basically, 'Let's run!' or 'We've got to go back and find Beth!' But because of the film's central gimmick, the fact that it's supposedly shot on someone's digital camera, it ends up being a lot of fun.The fun that's to be had in the movie is from the tension that is generated by the way the movie is filmed  one camera, no music; the sound design is the score. An example is an excellent little sequence in a subway tunnel. It's dark and we can hardly see. Yet we can hear something  the main monster sheds little monsters, so we know these little bastards are pursuing the characters. And so their reveal via one of the characters turning on the night vision on his camera delivers a bigger jolt that it ordinarily would.And the use of the single camera makes ordinary scenes of death and destruction far more expressionistic. We see bits and pieces but we rarely get to see the full monty. Which in the case of a monster movie is actually a good thing  Godzilla and King Kong wreaking havoc is so ludicrous when viewed from a safe distance that it usually elicits yawns and laughs. So the single camera helps ground the film  to ensure that it doesn't become one massive flight of fancy.However, I just wish that the filmmakers had the balls to go all the way with the concept. I was perfectly happy only seeing pieces of the monster. But at the end we get the grand reveal. Yep, it's not good. To picture the monster just imagine a massive frog-like mouse that has ape-like arms and which seems to have mated with an old man somewhere along the line. In all its glory, it looks terrible. It really takes you out of the film.And I also got fed up with the numerous endings. Oh, the helicopter's crashed and they're all dead? Okay, that's pretty brave: a bleak ending. Oh, no, they survived. And here comes the monster and he's killed one of the main characters. Okay, another decent ending: the cameraman is dead and the rest will lose their lives too. But no, someone else has picked up the camera and the film's still going. Rather than end with a bang, the film ends with a splutter.But to be honest, the film doesn't start much better, either. The first twenty minutes or so revolve around a party where we get introduced to the main characters. And what a dull lot they are  lots of bland late twenty-somethings. There's not one bit of fat anywhere. Not one ugly face. But there's also no personality. Indeed, the charisma void is so chronic that I had no idea who had perished  someone called Jason dies and I was left scratching my head. And then later I found out that it was the hero's brother who is quite prominent in the party sequence. Oh, okay.But once the destruction starts there are some very enjoyable sequences. There's a great bit where we see devastation in the distance and then the head of the Statue of Liberty comes bouncing off buildings before resting in the middle of the street. Finally we have a monster movie that isn't up in the skyscrapers, watching from the heavens.I also liked the street battle the characters get caught up in. For a brief moment it becomes like a war movie  the cameraman hiding behind a car as the army tries to take down its enemy. And there was something grimly enjoyable about the moment where one of the main characters, who's been bitten by the little monsters the big monster sheds, is taken to a medical tent and we see the silhouette of her head exploding. The film is surprisingly violent in places.But although the action is superbly done and the central gimmick works a treat, it's still very traditional at heart. The main character is in love with a girl he's been friends with for years. And because he's leaving to go to Japan, they kind of have a fling. So you're watching a guy go back into hell to rescue the woman he loves. Now this isn't a film where you feel like there's a deep emotional bond between the characters, so the central story is a bit of an eye-roller. Okay, you love this girl. Okay, you've spent a blissful morning in bed and you had a lovely day at Coney Island. But please could the pair of you just be a bit more than pretty. Please.But as it stands, the film's good entertainment. The action is well choreographed and the single camera works superbly. But it still can't transcend the monster movie limitations. It's still basically a bunch of idiots running away from a silly creature. Plus instead of a bunch of morons in top hats fleeing from an ape, we now have morons in khakis filming everything with their mobile phones. Yes, when the apocalypse happens it will be scored to a cacophony of obnoxious ringtones.",Null,1,2,2 February 2008
Crash," A letdown (spoilers)
","I wasn't the least bit impressed by Crash. It's a film that tackles an important subject (racism) but it's a film that tackles it with two-dimensional characters, contrivances and sentimentality. In the end all it says is that we're all prejudiced in our own way and that prejudice is bad. Well, to anyone with half a brain that's hardly a revelation, but although the message is a little obvious and pap, I would be happy to embrace the film if it were well written and well directed, but it's not.What disappointed me most about the film was the way the characters weren't characters but mouthpieces instead. It's like Paul Haggis has culled every different opinion and view on race and shoehorned it into his film. At no point does it feel organic. At no point do the people seem like people expressing themselves freely. They always sound like they're reading a magazine article, that someone is putting words in their mouth. Of course this is the case, but good film writing is when you completely forget there's a script.The worst culprits are the two black carjackers. All they do is discuss the prejudices they face. Sure this may be a subject close to their hearts, but I find it hard to accept that they wouldn't talk about anything else. And yes you may scream that that is what the film is about; prejudice, but I've always thought it much more effective to tackle subjects through themes, rather than have the characters rant about the issue at hand for a couple of hours like they were on Question Time. But then again, subtlety isn't a thing this film is endowed with.Having said that, though, I do admire the film for at least having a go at tackling racism in an even-handed way. It's a film that acknowledges that racism isn't the sole preserve of whites, that do-gooders do as much harm as bigots and that we're all partly to blame for the current mess. But although these things are touched upon, none of them is investigated in any depth. The film takes a scattershot approach to its subject, rendering it unsatisfactory.The most interesting segment is the one to do with Don Cheadle's investigation into a shooting involving two policemen. It touches on political spin, the way that shortsighted idiots want to promote people not for their individual merits but for their political value, and the way that pussyfooting around on the issue of race has a negative effect on everyone. But while I think this would make a very interesting film all on it's own, and one that would make more profound comments on race, it's just a brief portion of the film.Conversely you have a pretty poor segment focusing on an Iranian shopkeeper. The man is like Basil Fawlty without the laughs. He's a complete knob who spends his time ranting and raving and behaving obnoxiously. And he even gets so irate that he tries to kill a Hispanic man who he thinks cheated him (the Hispanic man is the complete opposite of the shopkeeper  he's so saintly it defies belief). But this leads to a syrupy scene where the Hispanic man's daughter intervenes (bathed in ethereal light and accompanied by twinkly music) and inadvertently allows the shopkeeper to rethink his worldview.And that's another thing that's wrong with the film. All the prejudiced characters in the film have their beliefs adjusted through tumultuous events. I know the film's called Crash and Cheadle at the start says that people are disconnected and only change their views when they collide with other people, but it's not really true. Yeah a traumatic event can change your outlook on life but people's prejudices are more often eroded through time and experience. So while I can accept people changing their views when they crash into other people, it just seems silly when it occurs multiple times like it does in this film. And the way it happens, too, doesn't help.I've already mentioned the scene with the shopkeeper, but the scene where Bullock embraces her Mexican housekeeper and says that she's her best friend is about as subtle as Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier linking fingers in The Defiant Ones and Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder singing 'Ebony and Ivory'. And then there's the final scene itself. The sassy black car thief frees some Thai people. Wonderful you may think. He's discovered his humanity. But aside from the fact that the scene is saccharine in the extreme, it also makes no sense logically. He frees a bunch of people who can't speak English and who have no money (oh, he gives them $40). They're going to have a good time, aren't they? They can look forward to living on the streets, being spit upon by people in SUVs and, if they're lucky, they might get a job washing dishes. It's the American dream, baby. But then to make the ending even worse, right at the final moment, there's another crash and more racial anger. You see what's the director is saying? The cycle continues. Wow, it's a revelation! But the thing that infuriated me the most was the idiotic scene where Phillippee shoots Cheadle's brother in his car. It was ridiculous. Philippee picks the bloke up, they behave like children and wind each other up, and then in a tragic mix-up, Cheadle's brother gets killed. The scene is one big contrivance. The director needs a sting in the tail, to again prove that the cycle continues, so you have a big coincidence, an unbelievable argument and a shooting. Yes the races are still uneasy together, yes they're still suspicious and yes the consequences can sometimes be tragic, but by trying to cover all the bases and all the arguments, Haggis spreads himself far too thin. Better to do one thing well than lots of things poorly.",Null,27,44,10 January 2006
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," War and sex (spoilers throughout)
","What I love most about Dr Strangelove is the fact that General Ripper destroys the world because he can't get an erection. It's just the most absurd reason to start nuclear war. Yet it also weirdly has a ring of truth. There you are, you're a General in the American Air Force, responsible for thousands of men and the safety of the country, and your sexual prowess slowly begins to ebb away. What do you do? Do you accept it like a normal human being and seek help? Do you just ignore it? Or do you let it drive you mad and then concoct elaborate conspiracy theories to explain your inability to get it up? Ripper certainly goes for the final option. Only this is a man who can drop nuclear bombs and who has an Air Force that can avenge his sexual impotence. The end of the world and the final big bang are his last orgasm.And when you watch the film it's amusing to notice Ripper's two big penis substitutes  his large cigar and his huge gun. He's obviously compensating for his sexual shortcomings. And the excuses he makes are hilarious. I can't help but crack up when he talks about 'loss of essence', 'bodily fluids' and 'fatigue'. What is the virile American male who's insecure about his sexual potency meant do? Nuke everyone of course! And the phallic symbols aren't only restricted to General Ripper. If the copulating aeroplanes aren't bad enough then there's Major Kong with a huge bomb between his legs. He whoops in orgasmic delight as he fulfils Ripper's revenge by dropping the General's substitute penis on the Russians. That'll teach anyone who laughs at his flaccidity! But staying on the subject of sex in Dr Strangelove, another thing that tickles me is the way that the Nazi, the Commie and the Yank agree that using a mineshaft (snigger, snigger) to have sex with lots of women is a terrific idea. Nothing builds bridges like promises of post-nuclear war orgies. Oh, and I also love the moment when Sellers as Strangelove gazes down at his groin with wide-eyed alarm as his rouge Nazi hand does something off-screen However, it's not all about sex (although Kubrick rightly shows that most things are about sex). Dr Strangelove is also about the stupidity of authority and the blind way we accept it. I mean, surely if someone is a General or a leader of a nation, they must know what they're doing. They must be right in the head. They must have our best intentions at heart. Right? Of course it's a lot of rubbish. People in power are just as crazy, if not more so, than everyone else. Yet like sheep we all go along with it. Just take how gleefully Kong ensures humanity's demise. He doesn't ask questions, he just goes along for the ride, whooping all the way. And then there are the soldiers forced to fight one another. It's always the ordinary people who end up paying. And how insane is the idea of a nuclear deterrent anyway. Whatever happens no one can win. Whoever fires first, the result is always mutual annihilation. But perhaps Ripper does everyone a favour by ending the insanity with his own brand of madness.As you can probably gather, Ripper is my favourite character. Buck Turgidson, though, would have to be my second. I love his cold rationalism  'Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed. But I do say no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops. Uh, depending on the breaks'  and his blind, patriotic pride  'Does he have a chance? Hell yeah!' He's the red blooded American male who's happy to cheat, lie and shout in order to get his way. And he's strangely endearing. Sure he's a loudmouth and he's really not that smart, but like Homer Simpson you just can't help but warm to him. And I also crack up at his prayer. It's very American to talk coldly about carnage and then give thanks to god. And speaking of the fictitious one, I also love the way that Ripper sends his bombers off to nuke Russia and those pesky Commie atheists and then says that 'God willing we will prevail and in peace and freedom of fear.' As always, the religious have a terrific way with hypocrisy.But it would be remiss of me to talk about Dr Strangelove and not mention Peter Sellers. He's magnificent. Each three of his creations is superb. But although Strangelove gets most of the attention, it's probably Mandrake that I like the most. He's just so terribly British. I mean, just take the calm, rather frightened way that he talks to Ripper. And the blasé way that his mentions his torture. And I still crack up when he mentions his 'gammy' leg. He's a sane voice in the mouth of madness.But there's so much that I love about Dr Strangelove and so many moments I could mention. However, it all really comes down to one thing. People are bloody insane and each day we spend without destroying ourselves is down to blind luck.",Null,1,3,8 July 2005
Alien," Exemplary horror (spoilers)
","What makes Alien such an effective horror film is how quiet it is. After all, most horror films make the mistake of equating fear with noise. But that's often a mistake, as silence is usually infinitely more effective. And so it is with Alien. The scariest moments are all devoid of intrusive scoring, jagged editing and overblown sound effects. Instead most of the sound and music is pulled out and shots are held for a long time.One of the best examples is when Brett is killed. He has to chase after a cat and he's led into a dark corner of the ship. You know he's going to get killed but Ridley Scott knows that you know. Therefore the sequence is dragged out. All the time you're waiting. You're waiting for the inevitable. But Scott doesn't rush things. He racks up the tension by having Brett wander for an inordinate length of time and by having him wash his face in a shower of dripping water as chains rattle in the background. And when the Alien does appear, it's not with a sudden jolt. It just appears quietly behind Brett before killing him. And the way that the death is played on the face of the cat, which has a look of almost stunned curiosity, makes the whole sequence rather spooky. It's not really a crash, bang, wallop sort of horror film.Not that there aren't plenty of jump moments. There are actually quite a few. But because the lead-up is so quiet and ominous it makes the pay-off a whole more effective. For example, when Kane looks into the egg. Again the sequence takes its time, but when he finally has a peek and the facehugger leaps out, it has the perfect timing of a great joke.Another fantastic piece of timing is when the Alien takes Dallas. You go through another long, drawn out sequence of him scurrying through narrow air vents before the Alien finally pops out of a dark corner. But although the moment is fantastically timed, the lead up is where the fun lies. Although I do have to say that the lead up is probably the most frightening thing in the film. Dallas scurries through narrow corridors trying to take the Alien out, but you know it's futile. And the dark, claustrophobic corridors are full of iris-shaped doors that open and close slowly and forebodingly, which really does add to the air of dread that fills the sequence. And the tracker is the icing on the cake  it racks up the tension to an even greater extent.The second most frightening sequence is when Ripley is finally alone in the ship. She sets the Nostromo to self-destruct so that she can take the shuttle but then with strobe lights flashing she sees the Alien. She then goes back and tries to reverse the self-destruct sequence, but it's too late. It's frightening because Ripley has to run around the ship, not knowing where the Alien might be. No longer does she have the option of just hiding. And with everyone dead she no longer has anyone to talk to or help her out. She's all alone. But perversely, once everyone's dead, the film finally gets loud. There's a countdown sequence (which is brilliant in the way that it adds tension) and the ship begins to destruct. Just when Ripley might have needed the silence to find out where the Alien is, she has to run around in cacophony of noise knowing that the Alien could be anywhere.But the silence comes back in the final sequence, and it's quite ingenious the way that the Alien is camouflaged in the shuttle. I nearly messed myself when I first saw it as a kid.What I also like about the final sequence is that it's weirdly sexual. Ripley strips down to her underwear and then the Alien appears. And the Alien then begins almost stroking the console it's resting on. And of course, Ripley penetrates the Alien a harpoon. Nice.Another excellent bit of weird sexuality is when Ash the robot tries to choke Ripley with a magazine. He shoves it her mouth and he looks rather turned on as she gags on it. Perhaps robots don't come with all the parts. Perhaps this is his way of venting his frustration. But there's also the way that the Alien kills Lambert. Its tail inches up the insides of her thigh and then you cut away and hear her screaming like she's being violated  the screaming is actually pretty damn chilling. And of course, Kane getting ripped open goes back to the male fear of childbirth. (The birth scene is still great. The blood, the sound and the way it takes the Alien two or three attempts to burst through is fantastic. But I do have to say that the way the Alien shoots off the table looks rather dodgy.) Going back to the Lambert killing, though As well as being chilling, this scene is also quite frustrating because Parker (Yaphet Kotto) gets killed as well. I mean, Parker is just The Man. I swear he could have taken the Alien had it not been for the cowardly Lambert. (It's quite surprising that the coward and the black character survive so long  they're usually the first two to go.) But although I dig Parker, I think Ian Holm as Ash delivers the best performance. It's quite subtle the way that he hints at his true identity  I like the way he jogs on the spot to get his joints working. And he's so smug and slimy. He's more of a villain than the Alien.But I think everything in the film is fantastic  the music, the special effects, the sequence on the alien planet, the production design, the moody atmosphere, the script I just wish I had more room to waffle.",Null,11,18,15 December 2005
Taxi Driver," 'Someday a real rain will come' (spoilers)
","It's always a bit worrying when someone tells you that they deeply identify with Travis Bickle. What, so you enjoy taking women to porno films, have a gun fetish and enjoy befriending 12-year-old prostitutes? If you say so, mate.But seriously, although it's a bit disturbing when people tell you they agree wholeheartedly with Travis Bickle's outlook on life ('someday a real rain will come'), I'm sure most people can relate to him to a certain extent. The loneliness is certainly something that most people have felt at some time. And really, even though you're surrounded by millions of people, large cities can be the loneliest places on the planet. Everywhere you go you see people making connections while you can only peer at them from the outside.This is certainly the case for Travis. He's a perpetual outsider. He just doesn't fit in anywhere. Just take the scenes with his fellow cabbies. Here are his work colleagues, people who go through the same crap as him, and yet he has nothing to say to them. They can't understand him and vice versa. But despite this he does try and reach out. He tries to tell one of his colleagues the crazy thoughts that are going through his head. But just as you feel he's going to reveal himself, he has to swallow some of the stupidest advice that's ever been put forward. A chance to make a connection has been lost. And yet, even though this cabbie spouts random nonsense, one thing he says has a ring of truth. He tells Travis he should get laid.And that's what Travis really needs. He desperately needs a shag. He needs a proper release. But while Travis does try and meet someone, he goes about it in the wrong way. In one excruciating scene he tries to pick up a woman at a porno theatre. Yeah, that's going to work. A woman who's working in a porno theatre is really going to want to date one of the jerk-offs she has to serve.And then of course there's the scene where he takes Betsy to see a movie. Fair play to Travis, though, he does ask this attractive woman out on a date and does a decent enough job of holding a conversation with her (although he's rather intense and insults one of her work colleagues), but just when things may be going right, when he may have a chance to ease his crippling loneliness, he decides to take her to see something from his favourite genre  porn. Even though Travis is desperately trying to reach out to outside world he's continually reinforcing his loneliness. And when Betsy's response to this charming outing is overwhelmingly negative, and when she no longer wants to speak to him, he blames the world for his sorry situation. He's completely unable to look within himself. The problem, apparently, is with everyone else, not him.So in light of this failed attempt to get laid, Travis reverts to a form of masturbation. I mean, all the guns he buys and all the macho posturing before the mirror is pure onanism. He's striking out against his impotence and the world that mocks him for it. And all the time when he sees sex or couples in love on TV he points his gun at them. He wants to destroy these people who have the audacity to pursue some sort of happiness.And when you think about it, Travis' whole idiotic attempt to kill Senator Palantine is the action of a jilted lover. Here's a man that Betsy adores so therefore Travis is going to blow his brains out. But of course Travis can't even do this. Again he's impotent.So with this act of vengeance a failure, the next best thing for Travis is to 'rescue' Iris, the 12-year-old prostitute played by Jodie Foster. I guess it's a strange kind of delusion that affects the lonely man, but they often seem to think that they're on some sort of righteous mission; that their pain and suffering is there to serve a greater good and that they'll be worshipped when they're finally understood.And so finally Travis gets to strike out against this diseased society. He finally gets a chance to get his gun off. And he does it in the most vile, sickening way  blowing fingers off and blowing people's brains out. This is the girl's knight in shining armour. This is her hero  a man sporting a Mohawk and dripping with blood.And so this begs the question as to whether the epilogue is some sort of pre-death fantasy on the part of Travis or whether it's a satirical swipe at the way we sometimes make heroes out of monsters. I mean, we get to hear a letter from Iris' parents where Travis is lauded as a hero. We get to see Travis with his work colleagues  now he's one of the gang. And then finally we get to see Betsy. You get the feeling that maybe she wants to apologise to Travis and give their fledgling relationship another try. But instead Travis drives off. Surely this is precisely what Travis would want to happen. He'd want to become the righteous hero, he'd want to gain acceptance from those around him and he'd want a chance to stick it to that filthy whore who didn't understand him. Surely in reality his bloodbath would be quickly forgotten. And surely, if he survived, he'd end up in jail.But that ambiguity is one of the many things that makes Taxi Driver such an outstanding film. You're presented with one of the most unflinching depictions of loneliness and how you respond to it is up to you. Hero or villain, saint or sinner  the choice is yours.",Null,3,4,12 August 2007
Over the Top," Lolita with prongs (spoilers)
","The poster for Over the Top features a picture of Sylvester Stallone thrusting his fist aggressively towards the observer. And then next to this there's a picture of a big rig and its lengthy trailer, which leaps off the page like a giant metallic phallus. Could it get any more suggestive? Well, there's also a picture of a hawk that lingers behind Sly's giant head, which is undoubtedly meant to cast him as a tough, uncompromising, macho angel- type figure. Yep, we're talking about another gay 80s film.But what makes Over the Top different, what differentiates it from films like Top Gun, Rocky III and Commando, is that the manlove is of the NAMBLA variety. Yes, it's Lolita with prongs.However, the film would like to delude the viewer into thinking its about father and son bonding. You see, it features an arm-wrestling trucker (Stallone) who for the first time in his life is looking after his twelve-year old son  Stallone walked out on his family for some unspecified reason. But because the kid's mother is dying, she thinks it's a good idea for them to spend some time together. But complicating matters is the kid's grandfather, who disapproves of Stallone.Grandfather's disapproval isn't explored in any great detail (he's a bit of a git and thinks Stallone is a loser for walking out on his family), but under the surface you can detect his secret despair. He knows that Stallone is leading his grandson into a life of sweaty bear-like men and swollen muscles. He knows that at the end of the long, lonely highway lie oiled butts aplenty. So the fight for Stallone's son isn't only a fight for custody, but for his heterosexuality, too.But from the opening frame it's clear that grandfather's fighting a losing battle. The kid is a cadet and no sooner has he jumped into Sly's cab than he's fanning himself with his cap  he's a prissy little bastard. And then when he goes to a hick bar with his father he orders a tuna salad and gives his dad a lecture on nutrition. Sly rolls his eyes, but only because his son may end up more like Liberace than Fabio.One of the most astounding scenes in the film is when father and son fight over the radio. Sly wants to listen to some girly power ballad, but his son, resisting his new lifestyle, keeps turning it off. Sly responds to this battle of wills by saying: 'Mike, I think we're wearing out this knob here.' I laughed for a good two minutes at that.After this, Sly ups the ante. During the night he pulls off into a lay-by and suggests that they stay in the cab for the night. 'A lot of truckers do it,' he says. And then he says that his son can rest his head on his shoulder if he gets uncomfortable in the night. Mike declines this offer, but when the morning comes we see that Sly has sneakily placed his head on his son's shoulder. And immediately following this we see a slow-motion montage of father and son working out in the sunset with another power ballad playing  Sly also turns his son's cadet jacket into a sleeveless number; you know, to make him look tough.More grooming takes place when we see father and son working out in the cab (Sly has a mini gym in his truck!). Mike appears enthusiastic, but after a while he begins resisting again. 'There's more to life than just muscles,' he says. You can see Sly desperately resisting the urge to say, 'No there's not.' But queasier than this scene is the one where Mike visits his father in jail (Stallone loses his son to Mike's grandfather and then he drives his rig into the guy's mansion to try and get his son back!). They talk more like lovers in a second rate romance than father and son. 'If I went with you, where would we go?' Mike asks. 'Where would we end up?' 'Together is all I can guarantee.' 'You say this now and then you leave.' And later Sly says this: 'I've got something inside that I want to give you in person.' Jail does strange things to a man. Or as far as Sly's concerned, it does nothing at all  he remains a homosexual, spaniel-faced Humbert Humbert.However, if the first two thirds of the film are all build-up, the finale is the orgiastic pay-off. Here we see Stallone enter a national arm-wrestling competition. Everywhere you look you see bulging arms and orgasmic faces. Plus there are bear beards everywhere. This is what grandfather was scared of.But somehow Mike manages to disobey his surly guardian and turns up at the tournament. And no sooner are father and son reunited than they're hugging and declaring their love. And it's his son's love than enables Sly to triumph in the most uncinematic sport in film history. Really, where's the drama in two overgrown imbeciles locking hands and trying to outwrestle the other? All you see are grimaces and hands going up and down. It's dull.But although the final section is tedious and the 'love' story is queasy, I can't write off Over the Top completely. I mean, it has Terry Funk in it. That's got to be worth something. And although I frequently laughed at the film's expense, I was never bored. But still, I can't help but feel that Michael Jackson watches it religiously.",Null,0,2,27 July 2006
Full Metal Jacket," Not a film of two halves (spoilers throughout)
","Most people see Full Metal Jacket as a film of two halves. They see the two different parts (before and after training) as pieces that don't fit. But they do, because the film is about how an ordinary person becomes a killer, and the film simply wouldn't function with either section missing.One of the most telling things is that at the beginning Joker says that he wants to kill. Obviously, as his John Wayne impression illustrates, he's grown up on films and their idea of war and machismo. Therefore it's quite understandable that Joker wants a piece of the action. He even says that he wants to be the first kid on his street to get a confirmed kill. Well, through most of the film Joker is a relatively passive figure. He gets to see other people come apart at the seams and he gets to see other Marines kill, but he never really takes part. But then at the end he finally gets his wish to become a killer. He executes an enemy sniper. But as the film shows, it's not really that fun. Joker even looks rather appalled as his fellow Marines make jokes. This in itself would be a dark ending, but instead the film ends with Joker happily singing the Mickey Mouse Club song with his fellow soldiers. It suggests that his revulsion is temporary and that now he's finally become part of the club. He's finally got his wish and become a killer. But at what price? Even though I mentioned that Joker really doesn't take part in things until towards the end, there is one notable exception  the part where he beats Pyle. Up until this point, Joker has tried to be helpful. He's tried to educate the dim-witted Private. But when the platoon gets punished for Pyle's mistakes, Joker finally snaps. He lays into Pyle with more venom than anyone else. And then as Pyle screams in agony, Joker can only cover his ears. It's a great scene as it shows how split Joker is; how he's capable of violence but how he also abhors it. And it's the point at which Hartman finally turns Joker into a Marine. He's finally put a dent in Joker's humanity.But that scene's also the point at which Pyle snaps. Before he and Joker were friends, in Joker he had a person he trusted. In fact, Joker almost acts like Pyle's dad  he makes his bed and even dresses him. But once he's beaten by the one person he trusted, the feeble-minded but innocent kid is turned into a stone cold killer. And rather inevitably, he focuses his rage on the source of his pain: Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. And Pyle's final scene is rather chilling. Hartman finally succeeds in turning the kid into a killer, but the programming has gone haywire and he ends up getting killed along with Pyle.But even though Hartman is a rather dastardly figure, I can't help but feel sorry for him. As he says, his job is to turn these maggots into Marines and weed out non-hackers. Therefore there's no room for politeness and hugs and pats on the head. The whole act of training an ordinary person into a Marine is an act of violence (one probably just as violent as war) but it can't be any other way, and Hartman is just doing his job. So there's no feeling of joy when Hartman gets killed. It's just an unfortunate incident  some people just can't take the programming; these things happen.Still on the subject of that scene, there's one little detail that I like. Pyle turns the gun on Joker but he turns it away when Joker calls him by his real name (Leonard). It seems that all Pyle wants is to be recognised as a person  the person he really is. And there's a bit earlier on when Pyle ignores Hartman when he calls him by his adopted name. Then when he's asked a second time he screams 'Sir, yes, sir!' at the top of his lungs. He's not going to take it anymore. He hates what he's been turned into.But maybe Pyle does himself a favour by taking his own life, as none of the Marines in the field seem particularly happy with their lot. Joker is stuck with reporting on the war and he has to endure his government's rampant propaganda (like today there's a fixation on words and terms  'drag marks', 'blood trails', 'sweep and clear' instead of 'search and destroy'), a gunner blows away civilians with a big grin on his face, a soldier dies for a hand-job and in a series of interviews the squad gets all their grievances off their chest. It's clear that these kids have been killed, maimed and destroyed for nothing. They've been sacrificed for some ridiculous political agenda.There are quite a few scenes where the soldiers express the pointlessness and futility of the war. They realise that they're not fighting for freedom. But still, when death is always an immediate concern, the only outlet is in racism, sex and killing.The scenes with the hookers (like the scenes with Hartman) are darkly comic, but they're also depressing affairs. The soldiers' only reprieve is in a joyless lay. And then there are all the racist jokes  both at the expense of the Vietnamese and the black soldiers. This is what all the programming has been for. All the humanity has been drained out of these kids and their basic instincts drawn out so that they can kill with greater efficiency. And it's telling that at the end the only thing that unites the formless squad is 'payback'. Only when they're killing do they act as one and only when they're killing do they feel contented. The training was a success.",Null,0,0,6 February 2006
Rocky II," The rematch (spoilers)
","If there's one thing America loves, it's a sequel. It's more American than apple pie and anal sex. And so therefore, despite Apollo Creed's statement to Rocky in the first film that there wouldn't be a rematch, and contrary to Rocky's assertion that he didn't want one, you knew it had to happen.Although to be fair, Rocky does do his best to avoid getting back in the ring. He tries to capitalise on his fame and make some money through advertising. Cue some amusing scenes where the mumbling, illiterate Rocky tries and fails to read writing from dummy cards as he attempts to sell crappy 70s cologne.After this failure to crack the entertainment world, Rocky decides he can make it as an office worker...even though he has no qualifications, no experience and no brains. He just wants a job where he can sit down and no longer be pounded repeatedly in the face. It's not much to ask. But unfortunately Rocky gets turned down by every employer, who are no doubt not only horrified by Rocky's lack of credentials but by his hideous light blue suit as well.But the early scenes where Rocky thinks he'll be living a life of plenty are very funny. We see Rocky spending money on horrible gold watches, a hideous jacket with a tiger on the back, a dog collar that he puts around his wrist and a car that he can't drive. And he then buys a house, mumbling like an idiot all the way through the showing. 'I like this mailbox. These numbers almost add up to nine. I like that. That's a good omen.' Ah, Rocky. Dumber than a bag of hammers.But the gender issues exhibited in the film are another source of laughs. Adrian is appalled at the idea of Rocky getting back in the ring, so Rocky comes out with this nugget: 'I never asked you to stop being a woman, so please don't ask me to stop being a man.' Me man. Me club. Me beat. You woman. You wash dishes.But what's up with these damn women? This Adrian bird tries to domesticate Rocky. She tries to protect him and she encourages him to get a decent job. But Rocky fails and makes a fool of himself. Damn Adrian has castrated him! Not long ago Rocky was standing toe to toe with the champion of the world. The next thing you know he's collecting spit buckets. And worse than that, he's meant to be happy about it. But eventually Rocky breaks. He realises that he was meant to fight. That's what he does best.But what about Apollo's motivation for getting back in the ring? Well, his problems are different. People berate him for his performance against Rocky. And one person sends him the following letter: 'You call yourself the champ? You're a fake. The fight was a fake. Go kill yourself.' I don't know about you, but I personally think that's the best letter in the history of the world.One of the funniest scenes in the film is right at the beginning. Apollo berates Rocky from a wheelchair at the hospital. Okay, it doesn't sound so great on paper. But when you consider the fact that every other word from Apollo's lips is 'chump', it suddenly achieves greatness.But even at this early point in the film, Mickey knows the score. He knows Rocky needs to fight. But the road to Rocky's epiphany is mighty long. We even have to suffer through a pregnancy scare which saps Rocky's motivation. Rather than train he sits with his wife and reads poetry. And schmuck that I am, I found Rocky's writing rather sweet. Goddammit, the first film is a fairy tale and this one is a soap opera.But eventually the inconsiderate Adrian wakes from her coma and tells Rocky to win. It's an incredibly hokey moment, but that's what Rocky is all about. Therefore, if you're anything like me, you end up grinning like a loon and almost start clapping in your seat.Apparently, in order to beat Apollo, Rocky needs to get speed. But not just regular speed. He needs demon speed. That's the speed he needs. Greasy fast speed. And in order to do this he needs to chase a chicken (?!?). Cue Mickey berating him when he can't catch it and yelps of joy when he finally does. It's here that you can see reality floating away into the distance. But it's bliss.The fight here is even further removed from reality than the first film. The boxers pummel each other constantly and there's no sign of them guarding or trying to defend themselves. But on the plus side, Apollo calls Rocky 'chump' after knocking him to the mat, so it's all good.The silliest part of the fight is when Rocky and Apollo stand toe to toe in the final round and just tiredly begin punching each other in the face. One after the other they tiredly throw and land head shots, and yet they still take it. But then Rocky begins hitting Creed in the gut, so hard by the way, that he's almost lifted from his feet, and then finally the Italian Stallion floors the champion. However, Rocky goes down too. From here it's a race for both characters to get to their feet. It's something that I've never seen in boxing, and to be honest it stretches the final shred of credibility that the film has, but nevertheless it's a great moment when Rocky stands up and wins. It just goes to show that when you ignore the advice of your wife, you can achieve great things.",Null,1,3,8 August 2008
Fargo," Super film with a super lady (spoilers)
","It's well known now that Fargo, contrary to the titles at the start, isn't based on a true story. It was just a little dig, a little joke at the expense of the 'true story' phenomenon. But at the same time it was a calculated move to get the audience to go with the story, because if the audience is told that something is true they're more likely to allow themselves to be swept up by it and believe in it. And I guess for some people Fargo may seem a little weird (well, to people who have been weaned on blockbusters). Therefore the true story tag was there to help make the plot seem more plausible.But, really, the film didn't need it. The film only seems odd in that the characters speak like real people, with all the broken sentences and 'ums' and 'ahs' (and 'yahs'), and act like real people  some act with nobility, others are completely feckless and some are violent. It also seems unusual because we're used to films where people speak perfectly, think perfectly and act perfectly. So, therefore, most audiences are used to a Hollywood unreality, which is why Fargo was such a breath of fresh air all those years back What I enjoy most about Fargo is Jerry Lundegaard (played by William H. Macy). He's such an idiot, a real putz ('What the heck d'ya mean?'). Yet despite the fact that he's stupid, and despite the fact that he has his own wife kidnapped for money, I can't help but kind of feel sorry for the guy. And I sort of feel sorry for him because he's human. He's embarrassed when he's asked why he needs the money; he's awkward when he's telling his son that something has happened to his mother; he gets angry when his plans fall through; and he loses his rag when the police finally catch on to him. Yet even then he desperately tries to maintain his dignity. He never reveals his true feelings. ('I answered the darn I'm co-operating here.') And I also like the fact that he always tries to overcome the new problems that he faces. He never quits. The funniest example is the way that he drives off halfway through a police interview. It kind of reminds me of The Simpsons (the sound of rushing footsteps and then the screeching of tyres). But there's also his final scene where he tries to escape the police by climbing through a window. He's a pathetic guy but at least he seems real.But although Lundegaard is something of a sympathetic character, he's also the most unforgivable. I mean, Steve Buscemi's character and Peter Stormare's character are just plain ruthless. They're greedy, immoral people and that's that. But Lundergaard is a family man with responsibilities and people who are dependant on him. Therefore, although he doesn't kill anyone, his actions are the most heinous.But speaking of Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare, they're absolutely fantastic in this film. At first they kind of seem like a buffoonish odd couple, but because you've bought into their weird relationship with its amusing eccentricities (I love the pancake conversation), it makes the violence all the more shocking. These aren't cackling villains or loud-mouthed bad guys; they're the sort of psychopathic people you could meet in a bar or on the street. And as a consequence they're more interesting to watch. I especially like the scene where Buscemi is trying to get Stormare to talk. Even kidnappers need conversation. But I also like the scene with the state trooper. It's the scene where the fun and games stop. You really know what these characters are capable of. And the coldly efficient killings that follow are brutal in how simply they're directed. Too often directors try and tell you how to feel. The Coens just show it, and it's a technique that, for me, is far more effective.Another thing that the Coens show are the Minnesota people. Having never been there I have no idea whether the accent is accurate, but it's an interesting portrait of a society. Everyone is so damn polite. Even when a parking attendant is getting threatened he's still got a big smile on his face. And there's one guy who, matter of factly, tells how Buscemi's character threatened him. It's a great scene because it captures the way that people tell stories  kind of flatly and with little creativity. And at the end they talk about the weather. Brilliant. But setting the story in Minnesota was a great decision because polite societies are often the most violent  just take Victorian England. Everything gets repressed and it ends up bursting. Plus the snow and the pure white landscape hint at something dark under the surface.However, what lingers most in the memory is the character of Marge. She's the film's moral centre. She's the one who sees through the insanity of what's happening and the one that gives you hope for the future. Indeed, Marge and Norm are comforting figures. They have a relationship that is without mystery but one that is rock solid. They give you hope that sanity will prevail. And I like Marge's scene with the frighteningly needy Mike. ('You're such a super lady and I'm so lonely.') Even in the face of such pent-up madness she keeps her dignity and her composure. She really is a super lady.And Fargo is a super film. I'm not sure I'd put it on a par with The Big Lebowski and it's a bit too thin to be truly great, but it's certainly an excellent piece of cinema.Oh, but I've also got to mention one of my favourite lines in film. When Buscemi is talking to an escort he says, 'Find that work interesting, do you?' The woman's reaction is priceless.",Null,3,5,17 September 2005
Predator," 'Stick around' (spoilers)
","It's kind of hard to write an objective review of Predator. I mean, it's one of those childhood films that opened my eyes to the joys of bloodletting, swearing and rampant homoeroticism. But still, even in the glare of dewy-eyed nostalgia, it remains an excellent film.The reason why Predator works so well is because it takes the effort to make the characters memorable. All too often these days in action films you can barely remember a single person. Just take the risible Alien Vs Predator. Not one person stands out. They're completely faceless. But in Predator you remember all of them  even Shane Black's character, who has about three lines, two of which are pussy jokes.My favourite character has to be Mac. He's a cool bastard. He whispers every line, snaps a razor on his face as he's shaving, stabs a scorpion off Carl Weathers' back and goes completely mental ('I'm gonna have me some fun'). Plus he instigates the scene where the commandos destroy the jungle with machine guns and grenade launchers. Sure it's ridiculous (everyone fires non-stop for about half a minute, but Arnie only reloads once  plus Mac is firing with a min-gun!), but it's also a piece of wish-fulfilment. Wouldn't every red-blooded man like to do something so stupidly destructive? Plus I think McTiernan is well aware of the absurdity. He pushes the scene so far that he must have his tongue in his cheek. But on a Freudian level the scene's got to be about impotence. There you are with a huge gun in your hands, but you just can't do anything with it.Speaking of Freud, I think Sigmund would have had a field day with all the cigar smoking. Rarely a moment goes by that Arnie doesn't have a large stoogie in his mouth. And then there's the revelation of Painless (the mini-gun). It emerges for a sack like a giant strap-on phallus. However, the most alarming moment is when Dutch and Dillon have an arm wrestle. The close-up of big, sweaty muscles would make even the straightest man question his sexuality. Oh, and then there's the scene where the commandos make an A-Team-style jungle trap to capture the Predator in. The scene is really just an excuse for muscle fetishism. Everywhere you look there are rippling arms and torsos. And I swear that Dillon is covered in baby oil (an essential for any soldier). Either that or it's just old-fashioned sweat. But either way, the scene achieves the desired effect: tent city! Where the film also delivers is in the one-liners. 'Stick around' is easily the best (Arnie's delivery is sublime), but I also love Blain telling Poncho that he hasn't got time to bleed. And then to elevate the scene even higher, Poncho fires a few grenades before saying, 'You got time to duck?' The film is well aware of its own macho BS.But I guess all the one-liners, character work and homoeroticism would be for nothing if Predator was an embarrassment. And looking at the initial designs on the DVD, this could well have been the case. But thankful the alien was redesigned and the creature works exceedingly well.And the film also does an excellent job of building up the tension. The infrared shots are suitably odd and the effects work is decent enough. But what I like most are the little things like the first glimpse of the Predator hand (when he picks up the scorpion) and the self-surgery. They give you a glimpse of the creature without showing too much. And I also dig the way the Predator rips out Billy's skull with the spinal cord still attached. Cool.Another Predator moment I like is when Dutch is face down in the mud after falling down a couple of waterfalls. For a couple of seconds he relaxes but then there's a big splash in the background  a splash that has seemingly come out of nowhere. It's a very simple way of reintroducing the film's threat, but it works terrifically well, as does the scene that follows where the Predator can't seen Dutch in the mud. McTiernan holds the moment for a long time and he never resorts to showing off  the moment doesn't need any visual pyrotechnics; it holds our attention entirely as it is.What's impressive about the final section of the film is that it exists without hardly any dialogue. I guess in that way it's similar to the final section in Alien. And like Alien, the isolation works tremendously well  the main character seems tremendously vulnerable. However, seeing as this is an Arnie flick, the final confrontation is a little different to the one in Scott's film. Here creeping dread is exchanged for more muscles and inter-species fisticuffs. But although the fight could have been cringe-worthy, again it works fantastically well. And it works because, for once, you're not sure how Dutch is going to win this thing. I mean, with every other Arnie film, the outcome isn't in doubt. But here you never really expect Arnie to triumph  the Preadtor just seems so damn big. And yet again, credit must go to McTiernan. Aside from two Arnie quips, he keeps things remarkably straight. And he also uses the infrared to good affect  it makes everything seem more panicked. I guess the only thing I don't like in the fight is the Predator's 'Eeek!' when the log falls on him. It's a little goofy.But that one moment is easily forgivable. And it's refreshing that such a macho film ends with such a downbeat image  Dutch dejectedly sitting in the helicopter. However, the film tries to cheer you up by having a 'curtain call' of the characters at the end. And as cheesy as it is, it actually works  it leaves you with a big smile on your face.",Null,0,1,11 August 2006
28 Weeks Later," A worthy sequel (spoilers throughout)
","First things first  28 Weeks Later isn't as good as the film that preceded it. Its narrative is a lot more flimsy, the characters aren't as engaging and it relies more heavily on cheap shock tactics to provide thrills and chills. But that being said, it is a decent sequel. It certainly doesn't embarrass itself.One of the most unfortunate things about 28 Weeks Later is that its best scene happens right at the beginning. The film opens with a group of survivors holed up in an isolated cottage. They have little to do but eat and squabble amongst one another. But then the infected attack and all hell breaks loose. As is usual these days, the action is frantic and confusing. Sometimes you're not really sure what's going on. But then Don (played by Robert Carlyle), while being chased through the house, has to choose between saving his wife from the infected and saving himself. He chooses to save himself. And the scene where he leaps from the cottage and is pursued through a field by swarms of the infected is an outstanding moment. John Murphy's magnificent score pounds from the speakers and more and more diseased individuals take pursuit. And then as he's running Don looks up to the window and sees his wife begging for help. But it's too late  she gets taken. And then with swooping helicopter shots and with more infected oozing from every corner of the countryside, Don heads for the river and leaps into a boat. It's heart-stopping stuff  wonderfully cinematic and strangely moving too. Can you really blame the guy for saving his own skin? How many of us wouldn't do the same? And I like the scene later in the film (in a supposedly 'safe' London) where Don tells his kids what happened to their mother. He breaks down crying and says that she was killed in front of his eyes  there were was nothing he could do. Again, is it so harsh to judge him? Would the truth serve any purpose? It's just a bit of a shame, then, that as the film is slowly building this morally ambiguous character that he becomes a fully-fledged monster.One of the film's twists is that Don's wife isn't really dead. Even though she was attacked by the infected, she's immune to the virus  she's a carrier. So then when she's captured by the American troops who are now running the show in Blighty, Don goes to see her so that he can apologise. However, he makes the mistake of kissing her and gets infected. The scene that follows  Don's brutal killing of his wife, is actually quite hard to watch. He beats her and claws at her and then sticks his fingers in her eyes. The film doesn't pull any punches in terms of violence.However, some of the gore is a bit silly at times. There's a bit where a field full of infected get mown down by helicopter blades. Heads roll, limbs are torn from bodies and blood sprays everywhere, and while it's quite amusing in a sick way, it feels slightly out of place in what is an otherwise deadly serious horror flick.A much better scene is the one where the Americans lose control of the new community they've established. Infection spreads, and not being able to tell the infected from the normal, the soldiers are given orders to kill everyone. I guess it's quite easy to draw parallels with the situation in Iraq. When you can't tell the bad from the good, just kill everything. (In both 28 Weeks and 28 Days, normal humans are shown as the real monsters, although I actually think that point is better conveyed in Boyle's film  the military terror in that film is more personal; here it's more abstract.) And then there's the carpet bombing of London. The military goes to all this effort to set up a new community and then proceeds to destroy it once it becomes clear it can't keep order. Again it seems to be inspired by the current political climate.But back to the scene where the Americans have been given orders to kill everything that moves. There's a wonderful bit where Don's son is wandering the streets, civilians trying to escape and the infected pursuing them as bullets whiz by and as the same John Murphy cue, the one that was used in the scene where Carlyle escapes the cottage, plays on the soundtrack. It has a wonderfully chaotic feeling to it. The real terror in the film isn't from people leaping out of the dark but of feeling completely helpless  all we want in life is safety and security, but in this film, like in Iraq, you're never too far from chaos; everyone seems to be conspiring to kill you, even those who are supposed to be your saviours.However, as good as all this stuff is, the film can't claim to be a classic of the genre. For one thing most of the acting is decidedly average. And also the characterisation is pretty thin. Therefore it's hard to care too much about the characters, as the film doesn't seem to care that much about them either. The writing, too, is mediocre. There weren't any lines that stood out as godawful, but by the same token there was nothing that stood out as outstanding. But as an action/horror film, 28 Weeks Later works well. It certainly gets the blood pumping. And although it hits you with a few cheap shots, for the most part it's a pretty smart flick, which is always something to rejoice when it comes to modern horror films.",Null,1,2,18 August 2007
The Thing," Proof that once upon a time John Carpenter was a fine filmmaker (spoilers)
","When I first watched it, I wasn't terribly impressed by The Thing. I can't recall precisely what I didn't like about it, that first viewing being maybe a decade or so ago, but I seem to remember finding it a little confusing and I can remember not being a fan of the special effects (some would consider that last statement heresy). But watching it a second time, I enjoyed it immensely. I wouldn't place it at the top of the genre like some people would, but it wouldn't be far off.First things first, I appreciated the special effects a lot more this time round. I think the problem when I first watched it was just how bizarre it all was. Tentacles? Bloody flower guts? Giant snapping mouths? Maybe I found it hard to suspend my disbelief, or perhaps I found it repulsive  I don't mind gore in horror films, but I'm not a fan of what I'd call 'gloop' (for some reason I can happily watch limbs get blown and sawn off, or see people get shot, stabbed and eaten, but my sick trigger is sensitive to 'gloopy' film monsters  I love David Cronenberg's version of The Fly, even though it does make my stomach turn in a couple of places, but I do actually come close to gagging watching The Fly II, and not just because it's cinematic manure). So perhaps I didn't appreciate the special effects for those reasons. But they're actually pretty great. One of the best bits has to be when an imitation human head sprouts a tentacle from its mouth and pulls itself along  and earlier on when the head begins to detach itself from its body. It's nasty and unpleasant and great to watch. And then there's the bit when Palmer's face rips apart and a giant alien mouth sprouts and bites a guy in the head. Neat. (And to make it even better, the man who's getting bitten is shaken from side to side, and in a couple of shots it's obviously a dummywhich is amusing.) But not all the special effects work is great. Although I love the head being ripped off and I love it when it shoots a tentacle from its mouth, it does look silly rather than disturbing when it sprouts antennae and spidery legs. There's a fine line between great and crap. And the bit at the end isn't particularly impressive either  the bit where we see huge tentacles and a massive monster. It's overkill and the effects don't match what has come before.Much better than all the big stuff are the little bits. Right at the end, right before the silly tentacle business and the unconvincing alien dog, is a bit where Garry encounters an assimilated Blair and Blair sticks his hand in his head. It's brilliantly done. And then after that you see Blair dragging Garry along by his face. Again it's sick and nasty, but in a much more believable way.However, it's not the monster that makes The Thing such an enjoyable film, it's the confusion and the paranoia that its presence generates in the humans (I guess when I first watched it as a kid I didn't realise that confusion was the point). After all, seeing as The Thing is a shape-shifter, and it can take on any form, everyone's a suspect.This climate of paranoia and suspicion is best illustrated in the scene where MacReady (Kurt Russell) ties the surviving scientists and workers to chairs so that he can check their blood to see who's human and who's not. The scene really is tense, as you haven't got a clue who's been assimilated and who hasn't. You're not even sure if MacReady is who he says he is, as even he's been built up as a suspect. But it literally could be anybody and the scene's a powder keg.Another great scene is when MacReady declares that he knows for certain he's human and the camera slowly pans across the rest of the group. Do we believe him, and who among the group isn't what he says he is? As well as the scenes of tension, I love the creepy moments too (they're often a lot better than the 'scary' bits). My favourite is when a half assimilated Bennings is caught trying to escape the camp (he's almost a perfect copy but his hands are deformed) and he lets off an eerie howl before he's burnt to a crisp (there's a lot of torching in the filmwhich I love!). And there's also the bit where MacReady visits Blair, who's been locked in the tool shed. MacReady opens a slit and Blair's sitting there by a noose while eating cans of food. He then begs to be let out. He insists that he's much better. It's a superb scene. And as simple as they are, I love all the lingering shots of the dog. It's a creepy mutt, I tell you. It's got a thousand yard stare.Also rather creepy is the ending. After all the pyrotechnics, MacReady thinks he's the sole survivor, only Childs shows up. His explanation is that he got lost in the snow. There's a bit of an awkward conversation, and even though Mac kind of knows that it isn't the real Childs, he's become tired and resigned to his fate and shares a smoke. It's an ending that, in the best way, keeps you wondering.And on a final note, I must say how much I enjoy Mac's snow-sombrero and his bad geography. 'Hey Sweden!' he shouts when he visits a Norwegian camp. The film's funny, too, and intentionally so.",Null,7,9,27 February 2006
The Village," When a Retard Loves a Woman (spoilers throughout)
","M. Night Shyamalan is such a frustrating director. Here's a man with a few of the skills necessary to be an exceptional filmmaker  he has a good eye, an ability to create mood and he usually comes up with interesting concepts  but he keeps throwing it away on pieces of rubbish. He just can't seem to shake off The Sixth Sense  he goes to the well over and over and over again.But what makes it even worse is Shyamalan's inflated self-opinion. He really does think he's making works of art rather than disposable fluff. He really does thinks he's an auteur rather than a hack. He really does think he's some sort of magician rather than a con artist. There really is nothing to his films. All he can do is try and attempt to pull the wool over your eyes.Now I guess someone could look at The Village and say its some sort of comment on modern society  look at the way these people have isolated themselves and tried to revert back to a simpler way of life. Or they could argue that it's a typical post 9/11 work. Those We Don't Speak Of (the monsters who surround the woods) could represent a raised fear of outsiders. This is a community that fears it's under constant threat of attack. But all of this would be to give Shyamalan far too much credit. He simply wants to try and give us a few scares and shout, Robot Chicken-like, 'What a twist!' I guess he also wants to pull our heartstrings, but the love story here is laboured and unconvincing. We have a blind girl (Bryce Dallas Howard  who actually is rather good) falling in love with Joaquin Phoenix (who seems to be comatose). But not only do they have little chemistry, but Phoenix is stabbed halfway through the film by a ridiculous retard (played by Adrien Brody), meaning that it's almost impossible to invest in their relationship.Having said this, the couple do get one enjoyable moment. There's a scene early on where Those We Don't Speak Of attack the village. Ivy (Howard) stands in the doorway, holding out her hand for Lucius (Phoenix). For an agonising amount of time her hand remains empty, and the monster outside is getting closer, but at the last moment Lucius appears and takes her to safety. It's all shot in slow-motion and it has a poetry to it that the rest of the film sorely lacks. If only Shaymalan could create moments like this more consistently.But when you think about it the film basically revolves around a resentful half-wit. Here we have a guy who has the hots for Ivy, but because he can't have her, tries to kill her beau instead. So then Ivy has to scramble through the woods to find medicine for her love. And apart from the crap twist, that's it. Therefore I think The Village should be retitled When a Retard Loves a Woman. It's an instruction on not to let horny half-wits try and fall in love with you  the film shows us that the consequences are disastrous.But such is Shaymalan's pomposity that he tries to turn the half-wit's demise into a tragedy. You see, after we're told that the village is actually set in the here and now and that Those We Don't Speak Of are really men in suits, the imbecile, seemingly by magic or lacklustre writing, appropriates one of these suits and follows Ivy into the woods. He terrifies her a little bit but the cunning lass leads him into a trap and kills him. In his final shot we see him lying broken on the floor, his face revealed and his body still covered by the costume. Shaymalan obviously wants to show us that he's become half man half beast  look at how the horn has corrupted this poor imbecile  and asks us to feel pity, but I couldn't care less. The moron got what he deserved.However, I must point out that the village idiot is actually present in one the film's other good scenes. The moment when he stabs Lucius is well filmed. I like the way the camera creeps up on Lucius as his back is turned to the moron. You know something is going to happen and you're expecting a typical Shaymalan cheap shot. But instead there's no attempt to make you jump. Simply the next thing you know Lucius has a knife in his belly. And it's a bit of a surprise, when Lucius falls to the floor, that the idiot continues stabbing him. It's quite brutal for a PG-13.But although this is quite well done, everything else is poorly handled. The twist, for instance, comes far too early and lands with a dull thud. Plus, to find out that Those We Don't Speak Of are men in suits at such an early juncture renders the final third without tension. Of course, Shaymalan tries to suggest that there actually might be real monsters in the woods, but it's a feeble effort to try and keep our interest.Then you have Shaymalan turning up himself in an acting role. Just hearing his squeaky, obnoxious voice is enough to bring me out in hives. You can feel the arrogance and the self-importance seeping from every poorly delivered line. When did this guy get it in his head that he can act? He can't. He makes Roger Moore look like Robert De Niro.Plus Shaymalan think he's a talented writer. He's not. Structurally the film's a mess and all the dialogue is stilted and juvenile. And somehow he manages to wrest an awful performance from Sigourney Weaver  something I thought was impossible. If only Shaymalan left the writing to others and stopped being so precious he might make a serviceable hack.",Null,7,13,11 August 2007
American Psycho," 'Don't touch the watch.' (spoilers throughout)
","I guess one of the main debating points when it comes to American Psycho is whether the murders are reality or fantasy. Before I read the book I was firmly of the opinion that everything was in Bateman's head. But after reading the novel and watching the film again I'm not so sure that you can definitively tell either way. After all, the whole point of the film seems to be that Bateman exists in a society that is so overwhelmingly self-absorbed that it doesn't even listen when he's begging to be caught. No one believes him and no one really cares. So if everyone turns a blind eye to the excesses of the rich, how can we tell whether he really did anything? Another factor that clouds matters is the way that everyone confuses the identity of the people they associate with. Bateman gets confused for other people, he pretends to be other people and no one seems to have a clue who they're really talking to. It's a nice little dig at the conformity of the 80s  people are homogeneous. But it also ensures that we can never be truly sure whether everything is reality or fantasy. At the end of the film Bateman talks to his lawyer, but his lawyer doesn't even know who he is. Yet his lawyer apparently had dinner with one of the people he killed. But seeing as people are continually lying, name-dropping and making mistakes, how can we be sure of the truth of this? On the one hand Bateman could be lunatic with murderous fantasies, but on the other he could be a psychotic murderer trapped in a personal hell where no one believes him and where there's no one to put him out of his misery.Either way I think the film is a resounding success, much more so than the book. The book is pretty good but it's self-indulgent and excessive. And while that's the point  the 80s were shallow, get it?  I can only take so many descriptions of suits before I want to hurl the book across the room. 'He was wearing a' Plus the film gets rid of most of the gory killings. And while I'm sure there were a few nutters out there that got themselves riled up about that, focusing more on the satire of things benefits the film immensely.But however you interpret the reality of the film, the message is really the same: contrary to Huey, conformity is bad. A couple of times Bateman says that he wants to fit in, but in actuality he has nothing but contempt for the people he works with. All the time he's competing, trying to outdo people with his business card, his suit or his haircut, but no one even knows who he is. He's not really a person. So his anger at being a non-person that's overlooked and outdone spills over into murder or fantasies of murder. It's one of the few releases he has.Sex is another release. The scene with the prostitutes is hilarious. It's more like masturbation than anything. For foreplay he demonstrates his understanding of Phil Collins and during the act itself he's continually looking at himself and narcissistically flexing his muscles. It's the American Dream, baby  sex, a buff body, hookers and, er, 'Sussudio'.But on the subject of the music, I like the Whitney Houston speech even more. I love how emotional he gets  it's like he's reciting some pretentious music review he's read  and I like the way that you cut from his tears to him having vigorous sex with a drugged woman.But speaking of Bateman's speeches, I also like the way he quotes restaurant reviews. There's no original thought at all. He's just a suit, a haircut and a lot of second hand knowledge and opinions. The latter is best illustrated in the Espace scene where he gives off a long speech about how America as a society has to return to traditional values. The audience is well aware of the irony, but Bateman isn't.But Bateman's a perfect embodiment of Reagan's America. He's fearful of homosexuals, hateful towards the underclass ('Why don't you get a job, Al?') and he earnestly spouts empty platitudes ('Just say no') while taking lots of drugs and having lots of sex. He's a hypocrite and a liar but he's 100% all-American.And like some American males he has a strange idea of masculinity. He's a misogynist, a racist and he's oversexed, but he pampers himself like a woman. But although he takes a lot of care over his body, his mind is left to rot. But then again when you're a privileged young man whose work consists of going to lunch, reading Playboy and listening to 'Lady in Red', perhaps your mind is best left well alone (maybe his choice in music is what drives him to insanity  listen to Collins and DeBurgh and be damned forever). But I also like his childish need to impress. If only he could get into Dorsia And I also love Bale's reaction in the scene where one of the prostitutes asks him how much his apartment cost. He snaps that it's none of her business but then smugly says that it cost a lot. Along with Whitney Houston, it's the funniest moment in the film.And it's the humour that makes the film worth repeated viewings. Sure there's a lot of fun in trying to work whether it's real or not (is his blowing up the police car a lucky shot or a fantasy? And is 'feed me a stray cat' merely a delusion or is it a delusion brought about by the killing rampage he's engaged in?) but I keep coming back for lines like, 'Huey's too black sounding for me.' Now if you don't mind, I've got to return some videotapes",Null,0,1,24 September 2005
North by Northwest," Sexy Hitchcock thriller (spoilers throughout)
","There are no two ways about it, North by Northwest is a sexy film. Just take the exchanges on the train or the film's final image or even the homoerotic banter between James Mason and Martin Landau. The whole film reeks of sex.It's quite fun watching the film back and noticing all the subtle, and not too subtle, allusions to horizontal activity. The most explicit is the conversation between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint. The flirty banter is superb, as is the scene that follows it. For all intents and purposes it's a sex scene, but because Hitchcock wasn't able to get away with that at that time he had to be creative, and as a result the scene is perhaps even sexier. But perhaps flying slightly under the radar is the relationship between James Mason and Martin Landau. Sure, years later, plenty of film academics have pointed out the homoeroticism that is present, but it's fun to ponder whether the original audiences picked up on it. I mean, just listen to some of the dialogue: 'call it my woman's intuition if you will.' 'Why Leonard, I do believe you're jealous! I'm actually very flattered!' And then there's the fight they have. It's like a sex scene. There are two close ups, the money shot and then one slumps down into an armchair and the other stands there, grimacing in pain and relief. But if you want to analyse it in even more depth, there's the fact that the argument starts with a gun. Only its Eve's gun and it fires blanks. The emptiness of heterosexuality, perhaps? Probably not, but like I said, it's fun to theorise. Oh, and while I'm on this train of thought, James Mason says 'Gay surroundings' with a distinct emphasis. I wonder if he's trying to tell us something? There's also a Freudian kink to the relationship between Thornhill and his mother. She looks the same age as him and they act like a married couple. In fact, at the start of the film, is seems as if Roger can't do anything without her. She's the one he phones when he gets arrested and she's the one that he takes on his early adventures. She's only ditched when he comes across a better prospect - Eve Kendall.But that reminds me of one of my favourite scenes. I love Cary Grant's drunk performance in the police station. It's bloody hilarious. I love the drunken conversation with his mother ('No, they didn't give me a chaser') and the drunken conversation with the doctor ('How much did you drink?' 'This much,' Grant replies with his arms stretched wide apart). Grant's comic acting is impeccable.Another favourite comic scene is the auction scene. Again Grant's acting is magnificent. The way that he antagonises the auctioneer is superb and the fight is hilarious. And I also love the scene where Thornhill returns to the house. No one can do dignified bemusement quite like Cary Grant.Less convincing, however, in my opinion, is James Mason. He's certainly got the urbane charm that the character of Vandamm demands but I just don't find him threatening enough. In many ways he's quite a forgettable Hitchcock villain. The only thing that makes him memorable to me is his relationship with Martin Landau.I also find the final action scene a bit disappointing. I don't think that it quite has enough energy. Plus Mason seems nonplussed at having been caught. Yes that's his character  always cool and in control  but it does deny the audience the satisfaction of his capture. However, the film redeems itself with its final image. I can imagine Hitchcock chuckling to himself having got away with it.But while I'm coming up with criticisms, I also have to say that the film is a little light. Certainly it's a very amusing film with some terrific dialogue, but it doesn't live as long in the memory as, say, Vertigo, Psycho, Rear Window or even The Birds. And the story, when you sit down and think about it, is completely forgettable. You remember the great scenes and the great moments, but only lip service is paid to the Cold War and the business about the microfilm. It's entirely superfluous.However, it's easy to ignore the more forgettable elements when there is so much worth remembering. Just take the crop dusting scene, the UN murder, every moment on the train, the terrific musical score and the fantastic dialogue. It's not quite a feast but it's a damn good snack.",Null,5,9,13 July 2005
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Risible machines
","People often complain that Terminator 2 was too kid-friendly  there were too many lame attempts at humour. Well, I've never had a problem with T2, preferring it to the original, but with Rise of the Machines the franchise goes too far. The most gut-wrenchingly awful bit has to be the infamous 'talk to da hand' scene. What the hell? The Terminator should have smashed the teller's head into the counter, not sassed him.And the scene that inspires this response is just as bad  the scene where a naked Arnie (still looking buff and questioning straight men's sexuality) walks into a club and gets 'dissed' by an exceedingly camp stripper. 'Woah, bitch, wait your turn,' the imbecile says. And then when Arnie asks for his clothes we get the 'talk to the hand' line. I don't care how deeply Edward Furlong annoyed you, or how hard you laughed when Arnie tried to express machine emotions, it's nowhere near as bad the series becoming like something you'd see on Ricki Lake.Plus the stripping scene hits the nail far too hard on the head. Yes, we know that as much as he loves groping young ladies, Arnie is overwhelmingly gay, but the homosexuality present in his films should be less overt  where's the fun if it's handed to you on a plate? Commando certainly wouldn't have warranted repeated viewings or extended analysis if there'd been a scene where Bennett had caressed Matrix's toned ass. And then to further confound matters, there's a moment when, dressed like a leather daddy, Arnie puts on some Elton John sunglasses as 'Macho Man' plays in the background. The Terminator has become a laughing stock.But this moment isn't a one off. At quite a few different points in time, Arnie seems to be sending himself and the film up. There's one bit where he's driving John Connor (Nick Stahl) and Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) to safety and he tells Danes to 'shut up'. But the line delivery is tongue in cheek. Who knew that machines could be knowingly mischievous? Another awful moment is when Arnie insists that he's not a robot but a cybernetic organism. Yay, the Terminator is PC now as well. (Next we'll probably get a black Terminator who insists he's a 'cybernetic organism of colour'.) And yet another indignity Arnie has to face is when his system gets corrupted by the TX. He has to enter the William Shatner school of acting  writhing in pain as he fights against himself. It's a pretty lousy scene.Not fairing any better is the TX  or the Terminatrix (vomit). She doesn't have the menace of the T-1000, plus she has a goofy machine arm that can spew flames and laser bolts. It's incredibly silly. And while Robert Patrick looked cold as ice and completely insane, Kristanna Loken looks like a bland, mildly bored fashionista  Patrick subverted the image of a cop, while Loken gets to wear flairs and high heels.Another detail that illustrates how lacklustre Loken's performance is is the way she tilts her head when she controls other machines with her gnarly powers. This cliché has been worn to death. It's something you'd expect to see on a bad TV show, not a massive blockbuster. And although Loken gets to kill children and shoot people in the face, with one notable exception, all her slayings are rather dull. They lack flair. However, at least the exception makes up for it somewhat  in her only decent killing, the TX rams her fist through a man's chest and drives the car from the back seat; nice! But this aside, the action is rather disappointing. Even the much lauded crane chase fails to get the blood pumping  it certainly pales in comparison to the storm drain chase in T2. And the TX/T-101 fight is a poor imitation of the fight at the end of Judgment Day and the shootout in the graveyard is a second rate version of the similar scene at the Cyberdyne offices. It just doesn't have the same intensity. And while part of this is due to the fact that the film's too light-hearted, it's also because the film desperately misses Brad Fiedel's score  the music is completely anonymous.Another problem is that there's far too much obvious CGI. Just take the fight between the T-101 and the TX in the toilets. There are far too many moments when you can clearly see that it's badly rendered computer models that are getting thrown about. It takes you out of the film. And speaking of CGI, why is it that the effects in T2 look so much better than the ones here? The damage that the TX takes isn't as convincing as the hits that the T-1000 takes, the brief glimpse that we get of the endoskeletons are crap and Skynet's vehicles and weaponry are awful. Maybe it's because T2, as pioneering as it was in its use of CGI, used a lot of physical effects too. Here you just feel that the filmmakers have got lazy. (By the way, what's with those crappy pot-bellied tank things? Whoever designed them should hang their head in shame.) About the only thing that works in the film is the ending. It's much better than it has any right to be. But it doesn't erase the crap that comes before it. Rise of the Machines is a poor film.",Null,2,3,19 January 2007
The Shining," Fact: Kubrick is better than King
","It's well know that Stephen King doesn't like Stanley Kubrick's version of The Shining (so much so that he scripted an abysmal TV movie version). According to him, Kubrick didn't understand the horror genre. Well, I think Kubrick did. I think he understood it only too well. He knew that it was a genre full of conventions, cheap tricks and tired clichés. Therefore Kubrick decided to throw all that nonsense out of the window and make a film based on atmosphere rather than predictable thrills. You don't get people here jumping out of the dark time after time. You don't get worthless shocks. Kubrick's version of The Shining is an insidious film. It gets under your skin. In other words, it isn't for Pavlovian dogs that have spent a lifetime being conditioned by cretinous nonsense.What runs deepest through The Shining is a frustration with family. Right from the beginning it's obvious that Jack isn't happy with his lot  as he's being shown around the hotel he can't help but take a sneaky look at the backsides of a couple of women. Well, can you blame him? The poor man is married to a bug-eyed, bucktoothed Olive Oil look-a-like.Then there's Jack's quiet frustration with his son Danny. As he's driving to the hotel, he's bothered by requests for food. And then his son makes out that he's knowledgeable because he saw a programme on TV. Already he's slightly irked - he's got to spend months alone with these people; one who resembles Popeye's missus and one who talks to his finger.So really the hotel brings out nothing that isn't already there. It merely brings everything to the surface  Jack's resentment as regards his wife, his frustration as regards his lack of writing talent and his annoyance at having a troubled son. It's kind of like he's testing his family. Are they strong enough as a unit to survive being cooped up together?One of the underlying themes in the film seems to be television. What happens in The Shining is what happens when someone stops watching the idiot box. With it, a person can find solace in mindless programming and retreat from the strictures of family life. Without it they're faced with all their problems and all the failings of their loved ones. Even the strongest family can be brought to its knees when there's no escape from each other's company. Therefore it's quite telling, when Jack loses the plot completely, that he spouts lines from TV: 'Honey, I'm home' and 'Here's Johnny.' Just watch some television, Jack.But it's also the pain of writing that contributes to Jack's insanity. There's nothing quite as harrowing as an empty page. Plus there's nothing more annoying than being interrupted mid-flow. One of the best scenes in the film is when Jack tells his wife to get lost when she interrupts him. It's extremely violent in how cold Jack is towards Wendy. And because it's grounded in a reality, it's all the more effective.Also rather unsettling is the scene where Jack talks to his son. He makes Danny sit on his lap and he proceeds to tell him how much he loves him and how he'd never hurt him. It works so well because it's so cold and because there's such an obvious lack of affection. The words are just empty platitudes. They mean absolutely nothing.Jack's true feelings are only revealed when he gets to talk to Lloyd. It's in this scene that you realise the marriage isn't all it's cracked up to be  Wendy has never forgiven him for accidentally hurting his son. And it's also in this scene that you realise (as if you hadn't noticed earlier) that Jack is absolutely crackers. He's talking to ghosts. But they could also be figments of his imagination, for there are mirrors behind most of the ghosts he talks to. Effectively he's talking to himself. And I love this matter of fact way of dealing with the supernatural. There are no fancy tricks. Everything just seems unnaturally natural.In fact, everything to do with the ghosts is superbly handled. The twins are spooky, Lloyd is amiable and Grady is out of his mind. And it's Grady who's probably the most chilling presence in the film. He starts off as a bumbling waiter but then quickly becomes a stone cold killer. Just the way he says 'corrected' conveys more terror than a million slasher films. And Philip Stone's performance is a million times more subtle than Nicholson's. I mean, as much as I like Jack in the film, he does chew the scenery. But Kubrick likes his over the top performances, so that's the way he wanted it.And undoubtedly it's Kubrick's movie. He's the real star. And I love everything he brings to the film. I love his command of lighting  just look at The Gold Room scenes. I love his use of music. I love the way that he turns the Room 237 scene, one that could have been a standard 'jump' scene, into a comment on Jack's marriage  his willingness to be unfaithful. I love the way that he leaves lots of unanswered questions. I love the shots of the blood coming out of the lift. I love the helicopter shots at the start. I love the way that pages and pages of typed words are the most frightening visual in the film. I love the maze. I love the fact that you see a ghost getting a blow-job from a ghost in a bear suit Man, I love absolutely everything about this film. It's horror for people who know that true horror isn't being stalked by a man in a mask, but being trapped alone with your family.",Null,275,432,16 October 2005
Collateral," A minor masterpiece (spoilers)
","I have to say that I prefer Tom Cruise when he's playing a bastard. I suppose part of the reason why I feel that way is because in person he goes to such lengths to portray himself as a nice guy  he spends ages with fans at premiers, he leaps onto couches on chat shows and he has a million dollar grin forever plastered across his face. But under that façade you can sense something wrong about the man. He's too passionate, too energetic and too eager please. He always seems to be 'on'. You never get the feeling that you see the real person. But despite that, under the surface, you get the impression, what with all of his nonsense opinions and beliefs, that there's a definite dark side to him.Vincent is certainly one of Cruise's darker characters. He's also one of the most interesting. Outwardly he's calm and in control but inwardly he's got a screw loose. Is this what Cruise is like in real life (without all hardcore violence, of course)? Possibly.Cruise does an exceptional job of playing Vincent. At the beginning he's smooth and self-possessed; he's got an answer for everything. And even when his first hit goes wrong, he doesn't panic. In fact, he's almost like a robot (quite a few people have compared Vincent to The Terminator and the comparison is an accurate one). Everything he does is instinct. For instance, there's the way that he draws the gun on Max (Jamie Foxx) after the guy has landed on Max's cab. Vincent wouldn't hesitate in shooting him. It's just a necessary response to a certain situation. If Max remains a threat, he gets killed.Another interesting detail regarding Vincent is the way that he disassociates himself from the violence. After he kills the first guy he says that it was the fall and the bullets that killed him. On the surface this may seem like a rather ironic attitude. But it could also hint that he has to distance himself from his acts in order to perform them. In other words, he's not as strong as he thinks.A second example of this strange sort of vulnerability is when he kills the jazz player. For a couple of moments he holds the bloke's head, almost regretting what he's done. But then like a robot he clicks back into gear and gets on with things.What I also like about Vincent are the little mind games he plays. There's the way that, when approached by some cops, he wonders whether they're married and have children  he's going to kill them if Max can't stop them from looking in the boot. And there's the way that Vincent makes up a story about his childhood. Just like Cruise you never get to know the man. There's only surface.A more substantial character is Max, the unfortunate cabbie that picks Vincent up. He's a man who's bullied by his mother, who works a lousy job and who can only find refuge in a postcard. Yet despite this he has ambition and plans to start a business. But while this might suggest that he and Vincent are miles apart, they're not so dissimilar. For example, they're both control freaks  Vincent wants control of his night's business and Max wants control of his cab (he's pedantic about cleaning it and he knows how long each journey takes). Another similarity is that they're both liars  Vincent lies to Max and Max lies to his mother. And yet another thing they have in common is their resourcefulness  there's a great scene where Max successfully impersonates Vincent in a Mexican bar (Max may hate jazz, but he finally learns how to improvise).But the effect of these similarities is that eventually each man sees through each other's crap. Vincent knows that Max's limo business is a pipedream. He also knows that Max is too much of a coward to phone the woman he meets at the start. But at the same time Max realises that Vincent isn't invulnerable. And he also knows that Vincent's sayings are clichés; empty words to perpetuate a false air of superiority. So it's a great scene when Max finally decides to stand up to Vincent by crashing his cab  Vincent tries pulling his gun on him but what power does a gun have when you no longer fear the repercussions? If anything Vincent has been too successful in breaking Max down. He's inadvertently forced Max to build himself back up into a stronger person.But while the power plays in the film are superb, the film also works purely in terms of action. In fact, the action is the best I've seen in a long time  probably since Heat. The most obvious highlight is the nightclub shootout, but I actually prefer the scene with the muggers. It only lasts a couple of seconds, but the way in which Vincent draws and shoots (the speed and ferocity) is phenomenal (hats off to Cruise). And this skill is also demonstrated in the nightclub scene. There's a bit where Vincent loses his gun and has to grab it from the floor. It's just amazing how many rounds Cruise gets off in such a quick time. It's a million times more thrilling than all the empty Matrix-like posturing you get in most action films these days.However, the film isn't flawless. It certainly falls a little short in the final act (it's just a bit too predictable). And in the moments in the attorney's building, Vincent finally does become The Terminator  the way he runs and lurks in the dark is eerily similar to the T-1000. But somehow with Mann behind the camera, he makes you overlook its shortcomings. He's just so good with mood and photography and performance that he elevates a relatively routine script into something of a minor masterpiece.",Null,0,0,13 November 2005
Ratatouille," Charming but not great (spoilers)
","As well made and as well written as Ratatouille is, there's also something rather uninspiring about it. It doesn't have the emotional heft of Monsters Inc. or Finding Nemo, it isn't as funny as Toy Story and it isn't as exciting as The Incredibles. Instead it's a tasteful film that evaporates from one's memory as quickly as a mediocre meal. There isn't much in this film to sink your teeth into.Perhaps the most disappointing thing about Ratatouille is its lack of laughs. After all, this is a comedy first and foremost. Therefore it's not a great sign when you only laugh out loud once.The scene that got this response involved the scummy Chef Skinner. He begins to see rats and he's growing increasingly paranoid about his ability to control the restaurant. So he speaks to a confidant about his fears and starts clicking his fingers, going, 'Ooh, it's here', pretending to see the rodent everywhere. It's marvellously silly, something that's actually a rare commodity in a highly controlled film.The problem that this high level of control has is that you can see almost everything coming. At the beginning you know that Remy the rat is going to be separated from his family and that he'll have to discover himself. You also know that he'll face challenges and strike up an alliance with a fellow outcast. And you know that near the end something bad will happen so that he has a challenge to overcome in the final act. You also know, because the guys at Pixar are smart, that Remy will succeed in the end but that his victory will be on a personal rather than grandiose scale. Consequently you see all the beats coming  there's nothing here that's going to take you by surprise.That isn't necessarily a problem. Predictability needn't diminish a film's power to entertain. But the stuff that connects the beats is hardly top-drawer material. It's very run of the mill.Which is a shame when a film is as technically accomplished as Ratatouille is. The animation is beautiful and the Paris that is presented here is gorgeous  there are some absolutely stunning panoramic shots and the scene between Remy and Linguini by the Seine drips with atmosphere. I also adored Remy's expressions  the rat can't actually talk with humans, instead he has to nod or shrug his shoulders, and it was always clear what he was trying to say.Another superb piece of animation is when a sleeping Linguini is cooking. You see, this kid can't cook to save his life, and Remy the rat who can cook very well isn't allowed in the restaurant because, well, he's a rat, so they develop a technique where Remy sits on Linguini's head (under his hat) and by pulling on his hair he's somehow able to coordinate the boy. Well, there's a scene where Remy is doing this while Linguini is asleep. But the kid has sunglasses on, so one of his work colleagues doesn't realise that she's talking to someone who's asleep  the gormless expressions and twitchy body movements are a joy to watch.But this puppeteering does make you wonder once or twice. There's a romantic sup-plot between Linguini and the film's only female cook. But the kid only kisses the girl because Remy is pulling his hair and controlling his body. Would Linguini know how to kiss otherwise? And there's a scene where Linguini and his girlfriend ride off on her motorbike. Somehow, in the heat of it all, Remy loses his grip on his pal and the couple ride off alone. Is the kid able to perform without his master rat puppeteer? Well, that's probably a yes, as the couple remain together until the end of the film.One thing that's immediately clear when watching Ratatouille is how good Pixar are at action. All the action scenes are flawless. My favourite is the scene where an old lady spots Remy in her house and begins trying to shoot him. She shoots her house up so much that the ceiling comes crashing down. But then we see that hundreds of rats have fallen down and they're staring at her. It's beautifully timed. And the action that follows where the old lady shoots at the rats from a bridge as they try and make a river escape is impeccable as well.And then there's the scooter chase, where the evil chef Skinner chases our hero. It's fabulous. But at the same time you kind of get the feeling that it's a little tacked on. The film knows it hasn't had an action scene in a while, so it throws one in just in case anyone has nodded off.But it's the attempts to keep everyone entertained with action and conflict and all the plot points tied up that make Ratatouille more ordinary than it should be. The need to have a story with twists and turns detracts from the sweetness of the film. Because the film is all about doing your best  it's about pursuing your dream and not giving up. But although the end of the film is lovely, I kind of felt that I didn't deserve to feel as warm and fuzzy as I did  I didn't think the film had earned this response; the end is great, but the rest is so-so.But speaking of the ending, I do like the way that Remy succeeds on his own terms. It would be too silly for him to become a famous Parisian chef, admired and respected by all. But the fact that he eventually has his own place and does his own thing is a good lesson for all  celebrity or fame should never be anyone's goal; instead you should pursue pleasure and contentment. That's the road to self-fulfilment and happiness.",Null,1,2,13 May 2008
Aliens," A perfect sequel (spoilers)
","Thank the cinematic gods for pluralisation. 'Oh, what's that? Alien only had one critter? Well, let's slap an 's' on the end of the title and have hundreds of the bastards. It'll be great.' And indeed it is. Die-hard fans of Alien may bemoan the different approach that Cameron takes  lots of guns and the Aliens themselves reduced to bugs to be blown to pieces  but the film is true to Scott's original while taking it in a new direction. It's a perfect sequel. The fidelity to the original includes the creepy atmosphere and the slow build-up, but this film has more action and more of an emotional pull. Indeed, it's the relationship between Ripley and Newt that elevates it to something more than just an excellent action film.The final act, which sees Ripley head off alone into the Alien nest in order to rescue what has become her surrogate daughter, has a whiff of absurdity to it. Skinny woman with a massive gun and flamethrower attached to her and she's going to kick butt? Yeah, right. But because Weaver and Cameron play it so straight, and because you've become so attached to the characters over the course of the film, it seems like the only thing that could happen. You totally believe in Ripley. This is something she just has to do. And it helps that there are no attempts to indulge in empty grandstanding. This is just a simple case of a mother going into hell to rescue her daughter. And as everyone knows, there's nothing in the world you should fear more than a woman who's trying to get her child back. Mothers are tougher than any Alien Queen, a point illustrated by the fabulous moment when Ripley burns the Alien Queen's eggs.However, the bond between Ripley and Newt was less explicit in the original cut. But in the Special Edition we get a great scene where we find out, because she spent so much time drifting through space in hypersleep after surviving the Nostromo, that Ripley's real child has died as an old woman. It's a great little scene and gives more depth to the relationship between Ripley and Newt. I'm kind of baffled as to why it was cut out.However, other stuff in the Special Edition doesn't fare quite as well. The least successful inclusion is the scene on the colony where we see Newt's parents find the derelict alien ship from the first film. It's kind of pointless and it's not particularly well filmed or acted  I can easily see why it was cut out. And plus, part of the joy of Aliens was not knowing exactly what happened on the colony. It was creepier when we could try and imagine it ourselves. I'm also not a huge fan of the sentry gun sequences. Most people tend to love them, thinking they add to the tension. But to me they only seem to highlight the budgetary restrictions. You seem to see the same bit of footage of an Alien exploding over and over again. Plus, for me, there was greater tension when you saw less of the Aliens. The longer you have to wait for the attack, the bigger the pay-off because you've been wound up that little bit more.But although the big attack where the Aliens come crashing through the ceiling is magnificent, I prefer the first encounter; the one where the cocky Marines are slaughtered in the hive. What makes the scene so fantastic is the way Cameron uses the Marines' cameras, the ones they have strapped to them, to add to the confusion of the attack. It makes it even more visceral - we see a lot of the action take place on a series of monitors.But this use of monitor footage also serves as a nod to Alien. When Dallas and his crew head off to the derelict ship this technique is used to build tension. But Aliens takes the concept that little bit further. And it's this unseen enemy, and the Marines' cockiness, that makes it feel like a Vietnam War film. The Marines start off with complete confidence and then are gradually broken down by an enemy that is less well equipped but that can adapt to its environment better.However, going back to the way that Cameron builds upon the ideas that were started in Alien, I love the use of Bishop in the film. After Ash in the first film, we maybe expect another unhinged robot or at very least a company stooge. And at the beginning Ripley treats him like crap. But after hinting that he might be another android psycho, he turns out to be heroic. And it's a lovely moment when Ripley finally tells Bishop that he did well. In a film that is relentlessly violent, it's nice to have a moment that has such warmth.Aside from building on the concepts started in the first film, another one of Cameron's strengths is creating memorable characters. No one gets lost in the mix. All the grunts stand out. My personal favourite is Hudson, the whinging scaredy cat who eventually grows a massive set of balls and kicks some serious Alien butt before being killed. Every line he utters is a work of genius. Then there's Vasquez. I don't know what it is about Cameron, but he always seems to be able to create believably tough female characters. Therefore it doesn't ring untrue when she kicks an Alien in the head and shoots it in the face. You believe this woman is capable of doing this. But smaller characters stand out as well. Drake and the Sergeant are great in what limited time they have, and I love Gorman, the poindexter turned good. And then there's Burke, who proves that a greedy company man will always be worse than an acid-drooling monster.",Null,1,2,30 March 2008
Control," A little too controlled
","There's no doubt that a dead singer will do wonders for a band's reputation. Just take Joy Division. Yes, they produced some excellent music, but quite a bit of it was incredibly mediocre. But because their lead singer killed himself they've obtained a glamour and an allure that they never would have possessed had they continued to make music under that banner.And part of the reason why Joy Division are so well regarded is because people can claim Ian Curtis as an example of the tortured artist. He's a man who suffered so much in life that death was the only answer. But that would be an incredibly shallow way of looking at things. Curtis was certainly a talented artist, but he wasn't peerless. And for all of people's romantic notions about Curtis, his suicide could have a rather simple explanation  maybe he had a negative reaction to the medication he took for his epilepsy.And I think that would make his story more tragic. To have someone's life and career wasted because of something as banal as a chronic condition or a combination of pills is a lot sadder than someone taking their life because they were selfish and self-absorbed. Because that's what Curtis is. He's a man who marries his childhood sweetheart, who fronts a successful band and who later has an affair with an attractive Belgian artist. If he wanted to grab it, he could have everything. But instead he wallows in self-pity. He feels like his band is getting too big. He loves his wife but she stifles him. And he loves his girlfriend but she's too adoring. Therefore it's kind of hard to feel sorry for this man. But despite his cruelty, there's still a part of you that feels for him. Life is never as simple as 'you should be happy with what you've got' and people's feelings are often beyond their control. And with Curtis this is made worse when he has to suffer from seizures and the side-effects of his medication. He's a bastard, but deep down you feel there's a decent guy struggling to get out.The end of the film suggests that it was Curtis' epilepsy that pushed him over the edge. We see him have a seizure and then he wakes up and kills himself, apparently unable to deal with his condition. But of course we'll never know what exactly happened that day. And we also never really know what Curtis is thinking. But this isn't a fault of the film. It's mainly to do with the man. For all his songs and all his writing, you get the feeling that nobody is ever really able to penetrate the surface.But although you can't fault the film for not providing more answers, it can certainly be faulted for being too timid. The film doesn't tell us that Curtis briefly flirted with fascism, that he took his first overdose at 15, that he dictated to his wife what she could and couldn't wear and that he threw wine over her when she danced with another man at their engagement party. It's a watered down version of Ian Curtis.The film can also be faulted for never really capturing the excitement of the band's performances. The film is beautifully shot, but the musical sequences never really take flight. And this can't be attributed to the actors, who do a great job. Instead it's a fault of the direction. It's too static.But while the filming style doesn't benefit the musical sequences, it works for the rest of the film. It makes you feel like you're looking at images in a magazine. You're part of this world and part of this story, but you're removed from it too. It's real but it's unreal as well. After all, Macclesfield only looks this beautiful on film. And that's the way we want it. We don't really want reality to conflict with the images in our head  we want some part of the myth to remain; that our heroes come from a different world, a world we can see but that we can't really touch.My favourite image in the film is the one at the end. We see smoke rising out of a chimney in a graveyard  Curtis is being cremated. He's being liberated from the life he felt he couldn't deal with. And although it maybe romanticises his death too much, it finally provides a level of emotion that was lacking elsewhere in the film. The man who existed in real life wasn't a particularly nice person, a man who sometimes treated his wife abysmally, but he was also a man occasionally capable of scaling heights of creativity. And it's that talent that you end up mourning more than the man.However, although the subject matter would suggest that the film makes for grim viewing, it's also quite funny in places. In particular I like the scene where the Crispy Ambulance frontman has to replace Curtis and face the wrath of the crowd. And that reminds me of how much I like the band's manager, Rob Gretton. When he introduces himself to the band he plays it big. But then in the next scene we see him in his underwear, answering a payphone by saying, 'Rob's Records'. It's a nice way of showing how ramshackle the whole scene was. And of course you have Tony Wilson signing his contract with Joy Division in blood. But although all of this is great, it did remind me of how much better 24 Hour Party People is. Yes they're different stories, but Winterbottom's film, even in the brief amount of time Curtis gets in that movie, manages to scale higher levels of emotion and invention. I just think Control, as good as it is, is a little too conservative, something Curtis wasn't...even if he briefly was a Tory voter.",Null,1,2,7 April 2008
Pearl Harbor," Risible soap opera (spoilers)
","Never before have I rooted for the Japanese in a Second World War flick. Never before have I so loathed the Allied forces.If Pearl Harbor is anything to go by then the American Navy was wholly populated by loud, obnoxious morons who spent their days courting empty-headed bimbos while drinking and whooping like some thief had come along in the night, scooped out their brains and trampled them under foot. The characters here are morons. Conversely, the Japanese come across as smart, resourceful and composed. They feel no need to hoot and holler, and they don't seem to be secretly ogling male bum cakes like the American characters do. They're entirely more likable. Oh, but what about the British? Well, they enjoy fellating beefy, horse-faced Americans  a British pilot tells Affleck that if the States has more men like him then their enemies should soil themselves. Like I say, the Allied forces in this film are wretched.But I do have to say that even the glorious Japanese forces have their bad moments. In a politically correct effort to 'humanise' them there's one bit where a Japanese officer melodramatically says that a truly brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war. And there's another bit where a Japanese pilot leans out of his plane and apparently warns some children of the impending carnage. It's an incredibly sappy moment. Although I'll change my opinion of said pilot if he was actually taunting the children and saying something like, 'I'm going to kill your daddy.' Another piece of political correctness is the portrayal of Doris Miller (Cuba Gooding, Jr.). In one scene he even holds his white commanding officer while telling him how gosh darn great he his. But perhaps more insulting is the way he indulges in hooting and hollering as he shoots the Japanese down  every American character in this film behaves like they're in the audience for some ghastly sitcom. I mean, it's one thing to have a fictional character act idiotically, but it's something else to belittle the efforts of a real person. And really, the character is totally superfluous. Everyone else in the film has some sort of connection to Affleck, Hartnett or Beckinsale, but Gooding exists separately. His inclusion is really just a sad concession to political correctness. His character exists only to prove to stupid right-wing Americans that there were actually black sailors who fought bravely. You know, just in case you're a Grade A moron and thought all the black sailors were hiding below decks eating fried chicken.But far more offensive than the political correctness is the 'romance'. Really, the film is about as romantic as drunken masturbation. There's just not one iota of genuine feeling in the whole movie. And of course the whole thing is completely unbelievable. Oh, some horse-face falls in love, goes to England, is presumed dead, then his girlfriend shacks up with his best friend before horse-face returns, then horse-face's ex-girlfriend finds out she's pregnant with his best friend's child on the day of his resurrection, and then the best friend dies in battle and horse-face and ex-girlfriend shack up again and bring the child up together. Yeah, that sounds plausible.But although the sequence of events is ridiculous, the scenes themselves are far worse. One of the worst is the courtship between Affleck and Beckinsale. She's a nurse, he's a pilot, and she passes him to fly because she thinks he has a cute arse and because he begs her not to take his wings. Then he turns into Inspector Clouseau and smacks his head on things and fires a champagne cork into his face. Somehow this is meant to endear us to him. The only thing I can say in response is that it's a shame it wasn't a gun equine-features accidentally shot himself with.However, I wanted to turn the gun on myself when Affleck goes to England and we have to hear Beckinsale writing her letters. 'Every night I look at the sunset and try and draw the last ounce of heat from its long day and send it from my heart to yours.' Somewhere Fabio is nodding his head in approval. But there must be about a million sunsets in this film  Bay has never met a visual cliché he didn't like.And Beckinsale writes her letters while sitting on a beach in a bikini (with a flower behind her ear) as waves crash on the rocks beyond. How old is Michael Bay exactly? It's like its been directed by a 13-year old girl. And just how white are Beckinsale's teeth? They kept on distracting me. Teeth shouldn't be that white. They shouldn't look like someone's painted gloss on them. But I also hated the way that every establishing shot was some sort of swooping crane shot. Is Bay really that short on ideas? Wellyeah, of course he is.But what really makes me laugh is the way that Bay has compared this tripe to a David Lean film. Lean made romantic films that didn't make you want to wretch, romantic films that were written and directed with taste and style, romantic films that were literate and intelligent. Bay's film is none of these things. It's an infantile disasterpiece. It's a film where simpletons have teary intercourse in a parachute hanger; a film where two whooping morons almost single-handedly make the Japanese air force retreat; a film where FDR heroically rises to his feet to show what the American heart is capable of; a film where a dying man says he's cold and then symbolically hands his children over to his best pal; and a film where a bimbo with shockingly white teeth says, 'Now I'm going to give Danny my whole heartbut I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset without thinking of you.' No film has done so much to dishonour the Allied forces.",Null,31,56,17 May 2006
Duck You Sucker," Without question, one of Leone's best (spoilers)
","A Fistful of Dynamite (or Duck, You Sucker, or Once Upon a Time  The Revolution, or whatever title you want to use) doesn't get anywhere near the same amount of attention and praise that the Dollars trilogy, and Once Upon a Time in the West and Once Upon a Time in America have heaped upon them, but that doesn't stop it from being one of Leone's best films. In fact, I'd probably place it as his third best film, above each instalment in the Dollars trilogy and just below the two Once Upon a Time pictures.I prefer A Fistful of Dynamite to the Dollars films because Dynamite has more substance and more emotion to it. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Leone fan and love the Dollars films to bits, but all in all they're just cracking entertainment (just, he says!). A Fistful of Dynamite, though, is cracking entertainment and moving as hell at the same time.One of the things I love most about A Fistful of Dynamite is Leone's attitude to revolution. He sees right through the BS of it all. He knows it's a load of crap, that the motivations are about as pure as a lump of coal. He also knows that it's the poor people who end up suffering the most. In fact, there's a great speech that Juan (Rod Steiger), the peasant Mexican bandit, makes when he's talking to Sean (James Coburn), the Irish revolutionary who has a way with explosives. 'I know what I'm talking about when I'm talking about revolutions. The people who read the books go to the people who can't read the books and the book people say, 'We need a change'. So the poor people make the change. Then the people who read the books they all sit around big polished tables and they talk and talk and talk and eat and eat and eat. But what has happened to the poor people? They're dead! That's your revolution.' Of course, with Steiger's delivery, the scene is even more powerful.But as that piece of dialogue proves, the film's cynical as hell. But I think history has proved Leone's attitude to be spot on. You get rid of one corrupt regime and another one is established in its place, one that is often worse. Therefore Leone suggests that it's best to stay out of things.This is Juan's attitude at the start of the film. He wants no part of revolution or politics. He wants to keep his head down and take whatever money he can with his group of bandits, all of whom are family members (Juan boasts of all of his children having different mothers). But slowly he's drawn into things. First he encounters Sean, who he thinks he can use to help him blow his way into a bank. And then, when he finally does hit the bank, there's no money inside  Sean has declined to tell him that the money was moved and that there are only political prisoners inside. Therefore Juan becomes an unwitting hero of the revolution. But then as Sean and Juan slowly become friends, Juan helps his Irish friend attack the government troops. This then leads to Juan's entire family being murdered in the caves they hide in. And it really is quite a powerful scene when Juan sees the aftermath. Before this scene he's quite a comic character. He dreams of robbing banks, he slaps his children playfully around the chops, he looks to god for inspiration and he even rapes wealthy women with his over-sized genitalia ('That's pretty good, huh?' and 'You pass out now you miss the best part'). But after his family are killed he's left completely bereft  Steiger really does look heartbroken; his performance is extraordinary  and he rips his cross from his neck. As he says earlier on, 'My country is me and my family.' After this, Sean and Juan become even closer. Sean realises that he's partly responsible for what's happened to Juan and he slowly loses his revolutionary spirit. Towards the end he even says that he doesn't believe in revolutions any more; he only believes in dynamite. And the final scene is extremely powerful. Sean and Juan meet on the battlefield and Sean gets shot in the back by the General who killed Juan's family. Juan then unloads with a machine gun, shooting the man long after he's dead. Then Juan talks to his injured friend, 'You leave me now, you know, what the f*** is going to happen to me?' And then at the end of their conversation, Sean gives Juan his cross back, 'Oh, my friend, I did give you a royal screwing.' But Juan shakes his head. He was glad they became friends. Beautiful stuff. And then when Juan goes off to get help, we get a final flashback to Sean's past (as in most of Leone's films, flashbacks occur frequently throughout the film) and Sean blows himself up, leaving Juan completely alone. 'What about me?' he thinks; the last spoken words. And then 'Duck, You Sucker', shoots onto the screen. But as Christopher Frayling says in his biography of Leone, and in the commentary on the DVD, a more accurate title is 'Keep Your Head Down'. If Juan hadn't of got involved, none of this would have happened. The film's much more than just a spaghetti western.",Null,2,5,21 March 2006
Die Hard 2," A reasonable sequel
","There's nothing new or fresh in Die Hard 2, indeed it's a shameless rehash, but that doesn't stop it from being rather enjoyable (although, unlike the first one, not always for the right reasons).One of the nicest surprises as regards Die Hard 2 (if nice is the correct way to put it) is just how violent it is. I mean, perhaps I've seen the edited television version too many times, but I'd forgot just how nasty some of it is. For example, there's a bit where John McClane stabs someone in the eye with an icicle. It's extremely gruesome. And the moment is made rather funny when Renny Harlin on the commentary says that he tried to do the stabbing tastefully. There's nothing tasteful about it! You see it in extreme detail. But that's why I like it. I'm fed up with PG-13 action films that skimp on blood and guts. Therefore it's nice to see some good old-fashioned gratuitous violence. (But I think the filmmakers missed a trick by not having McClane say, 'Ice to meet you' when he pierced the bad guy's eyeball.) Then there's the bit where one of the soldiers gets his throat slit. You get blood, a gaping wound and plenty of deathly gasping. Oh how I miss OTT action film deaths.And let's not forget the bit where the bad guy crashes a jet plane. This isn't one or two people getting killed; this is a couple of hundred. And although I'm sure some people probably harp on about it being disturbing in light of September 11th, it's not really. In fact, it's rather funny, especially when it's a plane full of clichéd English characters  the pilot says, 'Where the devil have you been?' (because, according to American screenwriters, the English don't swear), one of the stewardesses looks like Princess Diana and makes references to British Rail, and a distraught passenger looks like the dear old Queen Mum. So to me it's highly amusing when a screaming plane-full of fellow limeys goes up in flames (the Queen Mother, in complete contrast to the Dunkirk spirit, is the loudest screamer). And the scene's good because it ups the ante to ridiculous heights. You really want McClane to kick ass.Oh sweet Jesus. Asses. I've just remembered one of the film's opening images  William Sadler's sweaty arse. Why the hell does his character train in the buff? It doesn't make any sense. You don't fight in the nude. Well, you might 'fight' naked (with your sword), but you don't fight in the naked with your fists. Wait. No, scratch that But I guess this man-nakedness is meant to show that Saddler's body is a lethal weapon. He's taunt, he's tight and he's, er, stiff.McClane on the other hand is surprisingly masculine for an 80s action hero (the film may have come out in 1990 but it's undeniably an 80s action film). He even flirts with women! Get that; an action hero that would actually rather be around women than men who train in the nude. Arnie wouldn't approve.But compared to the first Die Hard there isn't much chemistry between McClane and the bad guy. Indeed, while completely mental, Saddler's bad guy is rather bland. But he does get points for employing a henchman who looks like Nigel Mansell (a man who gets his head crushed Indiana Jones-style).One of the stupidest things in Die Hard 2 (and there are many) is the way that Dick Thornburg (William Atherton aka Walter Peck) is on the same plane as McClane's wife. What a coincidence! But still, as badly contrived as the whole thing is, it still makes me laugh, especially when Thornburg delivers a narcissistic report on the crapper and then gets zapped by the mad old biddy on board (the speech is actually rather fantastic in how unbelievable it is: 'But at least the truth is NOT among the hostages because I, Richard Thornburg, just happen to be here, to put his life and TALENT on the line for humanity and country, and if this should be my final broadcast') Also guiltily amusing is the stupid Chief. Really, there isn't a film Chief that is as stupid and shouty as Dennis Franz's Lorenzo. He's entirely incompetent. And then there's the female news reporter. She always talks like she's delivering a report, even during normal conversation. And at the end, there's a hilarious moment when she finally exercises some journalistic restraint  she covers the lens when McClane and wife hug and kiss. It should be said that she has no qualms about shoving a camera into the face of bloody carnage; your gruesome death is public property. But something heart-warming, something upbeat and positive; oh that's private. No one wants to see that. (Another funny thing is that when the cameraman sees McClane and wife hugging and kissing, he says, 'God that's beautiful.' Yeah, big 80s hair meets sweaty, bloody, balding rozzer; beautiful!) But actually, I agree with the female news reporter. Who wants to see kissing when you have panicked crowds crashing through glass doors? Not me. In fact, panicked crowds crashing through glass doors may be among the funniest things in the world. I love it.But the film, though, I don't love. Sure I enjoy it, but it's really for the wrong reasons. It's for the incompetent SWAT team, the casual swearing, the macho posturing, the obvious dummy that gets squashed by scaffolding instead of the supposed flesh and blood victim, the bit with the ejector seat and the way a man gets sucked into a jet engine. It's a silly, silly film, but that's not always a bad thing.",Null,0,3,8 January 2006
Alien vs. Predator," Whoever watchesthey lose (spoilers)
","I never thought a film would come along that would be so bad it would make Alien: Resurrection look like a masterpiece. But Paul W.S. Anderson has succeeded in performing that dark miracle, for Aliens Vs. Predator (or AVP for short) is a complete stinker.You know the film is in trouble about two minutes in. There's a scene where Alexa, the main character, is climbing an icefall. Her phone rings and she actually answers it. Then when she gets to the top, and while she's still talking, she sees the person on the other end of the line standing right before her next to a helicopter. However, in the establishing shot only a few seconds earlier there was no helicopter in sight. How the hell did it get there without her hearing it? Very stupid.Just as stupid is another's character's ridiculous intelligence. There's an Italian archaeologist who's been hired by Bishop to look at this pyramid that's been found under the ice. No sooner has he been shown a poor computer model than he's proclaiming the style is a mixture of various ancient cultures and that this pyramid therefore must be the first pyramid ever made. He's quick. And he's just as quick in the pyramid itself. He reads hieroglyphics like's he's reading the daily newspaper, he knows the meaning of each room that's contained in the pyramid ('this is the sacrificial chamber', he says after being in the room for about a second) and he even understands the building's inner workings. This last bit leads to another moment of absurdity. The archaeologist proclaims that the Aztecs used the metric system, therefore the moving parts of the pyramid must change every ten minutes. Since when did the metric system have anything to do with time? And since when did the Aztecs use minutes? Did they wear wristwatches? But one of the worst scenes is when the archaeologist and Alexa get stuck in a room. Again the archaeologist reads the hieroglyphics like he's thumbing the daily paper and spins a yarn about the Predators teaching man how to build temples and create a civilisation. You see, Rastafarian aliens taught us everything we know. Kill me.But for sheer stupidity there's one moment that trumps everything else. A character is in the sacrificial chamber and he drops a glow stick down into the room below. Then later we see Alexa and a couple of other people wander into this room. She looks at her GPS watch and proclaims that this room must be directly below the sacrificial chamberwith the glow stick just a couple of feet ahead of her! Cocking Christ almighty.Just as annoying as all this, though, is Anderson's fanboy attempts to doff his dunce's cap at the previous Alien and Predator films. 'Look, it's Lance Henriksen! Listen, one of the characters says, 'You are one ugly mother' See, I made a satellite look like an Alien Queen. Oh, how I respect the heritage of these fine franchises.' Too bad he couldn't provide the film with a decent script, memorable characters or exciting action.And I guess it's the action that hammers the final nail into the film's coffin. After all, it could have been at least tolerable if the action had been half-decent. Instead it's total crap. Take the fights between the Predators and the Aliens. They're more homoerotic than the naked fight between Oliver Reed and Alan Bates in Women in Love. Of course you don't get to see any floppy bits flapping about, but you do get to see an injured Alien flick it's tail and lots of acid into the face of a Predator in a very camp manner (I can imagine Anderson patting himself on the back at how innovative he is). And there's another hilarious bit when an Alien is injured on the floor. It reminded me of a scene in The Simpsons where Homer is negotiating with Mr Burns to get the dental plan back. When Homer wins he lies down on the floor and walks circles on his side. The Alien in this film does the exact same thing. Stupid Alien.But even the penguins in this film overact. There's a scene where Ewen Bremmer gets spooked in an abandoned whaling outpost. Of course, we get the standard 'BOO, there's someone behind you moment' and then when Spud insists that there's something else in the room with them, a penguin waddles out. It's more of an old ham than the Alien.And I feel sorry for Ewan Bremmer. He gets to play some bland sap that keeps going on about his kids. Of course he dies, which is the only good thing he does. But the other characters are dull, too. Alexa, in particular, is a waste of space. I can imagine that Anderson thought he was shattering genre conventions by making the hero a black woman, but he completely forgot to add colour to her character (and everyone else for that matter).Almost as frustrating as this is the fact that we don't even get the pleasure of seeing these people die horribly; Anderson keeps violence at arms length  he cuts away from every screen death. And also, because his crap story requires it, people give birth to Aliens in about half an hour rather than the hours or days it used to take. Oh, and now facehuggers jump in bullet-time. Wait a second while I weep And on top of that, the main Predator in this film has an incredibly goofy face. Somehow make-up has got worse over the last twenty years or so. But what made me laugh/cry the most was the final shot: dead Predator gives birth to Predi-Alien. As if the hunchback yellow turd Newborn Alien in Alien: Resurrection wasn't bad enough",Null,5,8,30 April 2006
Batman Begins," Final Execution And Resurrection
","Fear gets mentioned quite a few times in Batman Begins. In fact, it gets mentioned about a hundred times. 'I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear on those who prey on the fearful.' 'Now you must journey inwards, to what you really fear.' 'There is nothing to fear but fear itself.' And then the whole of Gotham City gets The Fear and tries to rip itself apart. It's almost as if the filmmakers are trying to say something. Is it a comment on paranoia in the Bush era? Or is it an insight into how ordinary people are running scared from real and imagined criminality? Or then again, is it just a bunch of cool stuff in a big Hollywood blockbuster? It's probably a combination of all three, although, as you'd expect, the cool stuff takes precedence Along with fear, another word that gets mentioned with Batman Begins is: dark. Now, for me, that's good, as I like dark, but I have to say that I'm getting fed up with filmmakers and marketers churning the word 'dark' out with every blockbuster that is released. Its become a real cliché. Apparently Die Another Day was going to be 'dark'  it wasn't. Then Spider-Man 2 was going to be 'dark'  it was teeny little bit, but not much, although admittedly it was a very enjoyable film. Then there was Revenge of the Sith, which wasn't dark and which was terrible. And Hulk was going to be dark and Daredevil was going to be dark and X2 was going to be dark. But none of them were really. At least, not what I class as dark. But to me its just become a lazy way of marketing a film. It's an easy way of trying to fool people into thinking that the film has depth when it has none.However, I do have to say that Batman Begins really is dark (although whether its got real depth is up for debate). In some ways it's almost like a horror film. Batman sneaks up on the criminals like movie monsters do their victims and then proceeds to beat the crap out of them. It's cool stuff. Very enjoyable. And the fear toxin is superbly realised. I especially liked the visualisation of Batman. Again, very cool. Although I do have to say that if I'd seen it as a kid, I might well have encountered an accident at that precise moment in the film. It's a million miles away from the nipples and butt cracks of Joel Schumacher's Batman.But although the film is dark, it's also the most emotional Batman story on film. I mean, I love the Tim Burton versions of the character, but they were purely exercises in style (but what style!). Here though is the first time that people like me, who can't be bothered to read comic books, really get an insight into Batman and Bruce Wayne. I especially loved the way that the back-story was filmed. The robbery is particularly harrowing. And I also liked how Alfred's role was built up. Before, in the Burton films, you sensed affection, but in Begins a real connection is made. So much so that I couldn't help but lose a little bit of my composure when Alfred says that he'd never give up on Bruce. And that leads me to something else that I liked. I liked the way that the film reveals that Bruce Wayne is as much of a character as Batman, if not more so. In the other films it's hinted at, but here is the first time that it's explored.Another way that Batman Begins trumps its predecessors is with Batman himself. Christian Bale is fantastic. He's vulnerable and edgy as Bruce Wayne and absolutely fearsome as Batman. I have to say that I really dug the way that his Batman literally screams at the villains. That was unexpected but very welcome. And the villains were superb too, especially Cillian Murphy. His performance is like a block of ice  cold eyes, cold smile and cold attitude. It's nice to see some Batman villainy totally devoid of camp. Oh, and the soon-to-be Mrs Cruise is pretty good too. I mean, I may not have bought her as an assistant DA (the fact that she looks about 16 doesn't help) but emotionally she was fine. And perhaps it's just me, but it was nice to see a female role that didn't require some token female 'ass kicking'. After all, hasn't the prerequisite totty with big breasts and skinny arms that can kick butt become the new annoying female archetype in blockbusters? They've taken the place of screamers like Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale.But while I'm enthusiastic about Batman Begins, it's not without fault. The training sequence is sub-Matrix. The League of Shadows is like The Priory of Sion. The music is totally forgettable. Morgan Freeman is really just Q. The editing of the fight sequences is too over the top. And the final act is a bit of a disappointment.I also have to say that I was a little bit disappointed with Gotham City itself. Perhaps I love Tim Burton's Gotham too much, but in his films it really seemed like a character in itself. It was a work of beauty. It was a work of art. I loved it. But then Joel Schumacher had to turn it into Las Vegas on steroids So in response Christopher Nolan turns Gotham into something more realistic, which works superbly for the type of Batman that he's making. But still, even though I prefer Nolan's Batman, I prefer Burton's Gotham.",Null,0,1,25 June 2005
Transformers," Painfully bad
","I used to love Transformers as a kid. The cartoons were great and I loved the toys. But then a few years ago I got the toys out of my loft. Bloody hell they were crap. Cheap, flimsy and poorly made. How could I have been so wrong? How could something so awesome secretly be a pile of toss? Well, I guess children are both stupid and easily impressed.But I guess that assessment must be extended to a lot of teenagers and young adults, as a lot of people are saying that Transformers is a good film. Well, it's not. It's a horrendous example of film-making. The action is dull and uninvolving, the characters are annoying as hell and the writing and the acting are risible. What an atrocious piece of crap.That being said, the special effects are pretty good. But why would anyone want to watch a film just because it has some nice graphics? And anyway, even though the Transformers themselves are impressively rendered, you rarely get a chance to look at them properly. The camera never lingers on them, so you only get glimpses. Therefore there's no sense of awe. They never take your breath away like the space station did in 2001 or the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. They just look...nice.But unfortunately they don't sound very good. Yes I can imagine it must be pretty damn difficult to think of dialogue for alien robots, but the stuff here is just painful. 'My name is Optimus Prime, we are autonomous robotic organisms from the planet Cybertron.' 'You still fight for the weak! That is why you lose!' 'Freedom is the right of all sentient beings.' Just awful.Not that I was expecting Kafka from this film. But it would be nice to watch the film without having to cringe every five seconds. The dialogue here isn't even serviceable. It's floating about in the toilet. And the plot itself is almost incomprehensible. Okay, so a big cube thing lands on Earth and the robots want it and, er... Yeah, I've lost the will to live. I'm sure the film explains it all in its dim-witted way, but the movie is so restless, so eager to move onto the next explosion or next joke that everything just washes over you like a tide of effluent.But what about the characters? Okay, so even if the writing and the direction are pants, maybe the characters can save it. Er, no. Nearly all the people here just made me want to kill them. Whether it be Jon Voight as the Defence Secretary, the fat black guy who's mouthy but a genius, the blonde Australian bimbo, the army guys, the Transformers themselves or Megan Fox's airhead heroine. The only people who don't totally humiliate themselves are John Turturro (who's always fun), Bernie Mac (who's gets to be an amusing jerk for about ten seconds) and Shia LaBeouf (who's passable as the film's hero). Everyone else though can go to hell.And Megan Fox can go there first. She's got great legs and a flat stomach that I'm sure loads of men are dribbling over, but she seems barely sentient. She has no charisma, no screen presence and no ability as an actress. She's a dull fantasy for teenagers and men with no taste. I mean, there's a scene where she looks under the bonnet of a car and tells the panting LaBeouf what's wrong. Maybe I'm asking too much in wanting believability in a film about alien robots, but I can barely believe that Fox knows how to open a door let alone know her way around an automobile.But now that I think about it, there is something worse than Megan Fox  the annoying little Decepticon robot that runs around. It's meant to be a Puckish figure. A cheeky little rapscallion. But every time it was on screen, which was often, I wanted to rip Michael Bay's arm off and slap him in the face with it. This little robot is one of the most irritating screen presences I've ever seen. I'd rather have five hundred Bette Midlers dancing around. They'd infuriate me less.And is it just me or is there the whiff or something unsavoury in the way that the Decepticons (minus Megatron) all speak an alien foreign language and want to destroy the world and the way that the Autobots all speak perfect English and want to protect it? Take this robotic bitch-slapping surrogate Muslim fundies! But how to explain Megatron speaking English? Maybe he was the smart one that was sent overseas to learn a proper civilised language. And then something went wrong in his brain circuits and he turned loopy.But this would give the film too much credit. Transformers is really just all about building up to one large robot face-off. Too bad, then, that the final sequence is a snoozefest. Part of the reason for this is because we don't care a jot about the characters and their fates, but it's also because the direction is so poor. We rarely get to see what's going on. Indeed, half the time it's hard to know which side the robots are fighting for. Is that big thing an Autobot or a Decepticon? At least in the cartoons you had helpful logos on the characters to tell you who was who. But here you're screwed. Yeah, you might be able to recognise Optimus Prime and Megatron (maybe even Bumblebee, seeing as he's actually given screen time), but the others are just anonymous blobs. And as such, the one reason to watch the film, to see gnarly robots beat the snot out of each other, is rendered pointless. You might as well just get those toys out the loft. As bad as they are you'll probably have more fun.",Null,5,11,17 January 2008
Million Dollar Baby," Completely Oscar-worthy (spoilers)
","The reason why Million Dollar Baby works so well is because it's not really a boxing film. It's really a film about paternal love. Therefore the two main characters could be anything and the film would still probably work. However, that's not to say that the boxing doesn't help the film, because it does. It helps give the film grit, it works as a metaphor for all the knocks the two main characters have suffered in their lives and it gives the film a certain novelty value  female boxers being rare in cinema.And this little bit of novelty value is important because a lot of the film has already been covered  the plucky amateur, the reluctant trainer, the wise old man who never quite made it and the cocky youngsters. So initially there's a feeling that we've already seen this loads of times before. But even before the 'twist', and despite the sense of over-familiarity, the film has a certain something that intrigues and appeals. It isn't that it's about a female boxer, because that doesn't differentiate it much from other boxing films, it's that it has a lot of soul. Unlike other films about boxing it doesn't glamorise the sport. Instead it acknowledges that people watch boxing because they like seeing violence and because they get off on human suffering. So instead of a triumphant film you have a rather melancholy one.However, despite the slightly sombre tone, there is quite a bit of humour in the film. And some of it works and some of it doesn't. I liked the scenes where Frankie (Eastwood) torments his pastor, and I liked the banter between Frankie and Eddie (Freeman), but the special needs kid who wants to be a boxer was far too cute. It really felt like something out of another movie. It isn't needed and it adds nothing to the film  except to give the audience a cheap 'Yes!' moment when Eddie punches the bully's lights out.Something else that wasn't needed was the evil white trash family. Had they been realistically nasty they would have served their purpose  they push Maggie (Swank) into Frankie's arms, a man who becomes her real family  but instead they're far too cartoonish. I can well believe that a mother would try and take her injured daughter's money from her, as families do horrid things to each other all the time, but it just didn't feel right. It wasn't well played.But the special needs boxer and the evil white trash family don't take up that much time and therefore they don't detract from the rest of the film. And the rest of the film is great. One of the little things I loved was Frankie's strained relationship with his daughter. You never get to find out what went wrong between them, but with her sending his letters back you begin to understand part of the reason why Frankie is reluctant to train 'girls' and why he eventually relents  his relationship with Maggie is some sort of atonement for past mistakes. And there's a powerful little moment after Maggie has broken her neck when Frankie goes home and sees yet another returned letter on the floor. The sadness on Eastwood's face speaks volumes (his performance his wonderful, as is Swank's).But another wonderful little moment is when Frankie cleans Maggie's bedsores. He says the nurses don't know what they're doing. At that moment he really is her father. He's doing what any man would do for his daughter if they were in such an unfortunate position. And there's a great little moment where she quietly says thank you. It's a line that can pass by unnoticed if you're not paying attention, but it says so much.And there are quite a few nice little bits between the characters during the film, moments that don't call attention to themselves but which generate a depth of feeling for the people involved. One such scene is when Maggie busts her nose. At the hospital, when she has to go off to be seen, Frankie says that he'll be right there. Again he's acting exactly like her dad. And I also liked the scene where halfway through Maggie's first proper fight Frankie joins her corner. She looks delighted to have him and he looks proud as punch when she wins. And afterwards there's a nice little exchange. 'You gonna leave me again?' 'Never.' And another small moment that helps greatly is when Frankie gives Maggie an expensive robe for her fight. It's a dad giving his daughter a gift.However, this does lead me to one final problem I have with the film. I didn't particularly like the fight where Maggie gets injured. The dirty German boxer again was just a bit over the top. I mean, I know boxers have lots of dirty tricks, but can someone really get away with punching an opponent when they're getting up off the mat? Rather than coming across as a dirty fighter the German came over more like a scheming villain  although I do like the fact that the German's actions are somewhat motivated by Frankie insulting her earlier, meaning that he's somewhat responsible for Maggie's injury; but I do think Eastwood took the German's rule breaking a step too far.But the final scenes between Frankie and Maggie more than make up for the film's shortcomings. They hit really hard. And Frankie's last act is a genuine act of compassion; it's entirely selfless and it expresses how much he's come to love Maggie  he ignores his feelings to give her some dignity. And the very end itself is both hopeful and hopeless. It's hopeful because there's a chance that Frankie's daughter will find out what sort of man her father was and it's hopeless because Frankie will never get over what he did. A wonderful film.",Null,2,4,24 May 2006
Garden State," Dull romantic comedy with indie dressing (spoilers)
","There's the kernel of a good idea lurking somewhere within Garden State's obnoxious body. There's potential in the story of a young man going back to his hometown to try and redress his strained relationship with his father in the wake of his mother's death. But sadly, instead of using subtlety to deal with the issues at hand, we're bludgeoned with 'whacky' humour, annoying characters and limp-wristed music. The film's a smorgasbord of tricks and conceits, none of which work.The film begins with quite an interesting image. Braff sits expressionless on a plane as everyone else screams in panic  the plane seems to be crashing. It's nicely shot in slow motion and it tells you a lot about the character. But unfortunately that one shot also tells you all you need to know about him  he's numb to the nosedive his life has taken. So right from the beginning you know everything you need to know about this person. And the details you find out later really add little or nothing to our understanding of him; nothing is explored in any meaningful way (an insightful look into the effects of long-term prescription drug use, it most certainly isn't).And that shot of Braff sitting expressionless on the plane is an ominous warning as to the quality of Braff's performance. He literally does nothing but look glum. But instead of portraying sadness as it really is  an external stillness with an internal chaos  he merely looks bored. And you never get the feeling that there's anything going on behind Braff's eyes  he's not a good enough actor to project his thoughts to the audience.The effect all this had on me was that I really couldn't care about his character. His problems seem no different to everyone else's and he never seemed real enough to draw any sympathy. And it's the refusal to deal with reality that frustrated me the most. All the time the film tries to be cute or quirky or whacky when a little realism would have suited the theme of the film much better  a genuine look at disaffection and grief is eschewed in favour of hamster funerals and women reciting Lionel Ritchie lyrics.But although Braff is a blank faced waste of space, a pouting non-entity who seems to be made out of MDF, it's Natalie Portman who makes this film an ordeal. She plays an epileptic who compulsively lies, who makes annoying sounds in a deluded attempt to be original, who keeps a pet cemetery in her garden and who, most heinously of all, wont shut her goddamned mouth. Seriously, any man who willing listens to her empty-headed twittering deserves depression. She's the kind of woman that would make any right-headed man hack his balls off with a garden trowel if he had to spend more than five minutes with her. I mean, there's a scene where she grabs a cup so she can capture Braff's tears. These aren't the actions of a lovable eccentric, they're the actions of a lunatic.And then there's the scene where we're introduced to her. She laughs as a dog humps Braff's leg and then she talks and talks and talks and talks. And after she's bored us all to death with her self-important dribble she makes Braff listen to a piece of music. Apparently it's so good it'll change Braff's life. But instead all we hear are The Shins. And the moment with the music is completely pointless. It doesn't add any emotion and it doesn't tells us anything of any interest about the characters. It's only there because Braff loves The Shins and he's going to shoehorn them into his film in any way he can.But the film's most spectacular failure is its inability to produce any laughs. Every gag in the film is either tired (dog humping someone's leg? I've never seen that before), twee (a dotty old woman gives Braff a shirt that is the same awful design as her wallpaper) or self-conscious (in one scene Braff wakes up to see a knight walking about, a knight who turns out to be a kid who works at one of those medieval themed restaurants. It's a joke that is trying far too hard to be odd. And it defies logic. Wouldn't the kid get dressed at work rather than drive his car while wearing a cumbersome suit? But Braff doesn't want logic to get in the way of his failed attempt to be original). Other self-consciously 'quirky' jokes that don't work include the scene where characters speak Klingon, the scene where we see Portman ice skating as an alligator, the bit in a hotel where we see lots of couples shagging (ooh, how edgy!) and the exchange between Braff and a police officer who likes to swear a lot and who likes to show off his gun.And this brings me to another problem. The film tries so hard to be hip  the swearing and the sex  but it just doesn't work. And I'm someone who gets a kick out of profanity and sleaze. But here it's just thrown in for no reason. And although I can easily enjoy gratuitous sex and swearing, here it left me completely unmoved.And for a film that tries so hard to defy conventions it doesn't half end up being conventional. Boy and girl fall in love; boy goes to leave; couple say goodbye at airport; boy gets off plane and surprises girl; couple kiss  the end. This is your standard boring romantic comedy with retard jokes thrown in in a failed attempt to differentiate it from all the other meaningless fluff out there.",Null,2,4,28 May 2006
Dumb and Dumber," Suck me sideways
","I'd find it hard to trust someone who wasn't the slightest bit amused by Dumb and Dumber. After all, what kind of person doesn't laugh at a man firing hot waves of watery excrement out of his horrorstruck anus, or at a blind boy stroking a decapitated bird, or at an owl being shot by a cork? These are all things that should appeal to any right-minded individual  it's comedy at its basest, but the funny bone should never be concerned with good taste.Of all the gags and silly lines in Dumber and Dumber, my favourite moment actually involves attempted male rape (always a prime source for comedy!). The moment I'm talking about is when Sea Bass very nearly forces himself on one of our heroes. But one of the things I love most about the scene is Lloyd's fascination when reading the message on the toilet wall. 'For manly love be here March 25th at 2:15am sharp' it reads. Lloyd looks amused, even a little bit curious, but then as he consults his watch you hear a 'Wah-wah' on the soundtrack, which translates into 'you're about to get buggered' and the smile on his face vanishes. Wonderful stuff.But the character of Sea Bass himself is just bloody hilarious (even if he only has two scenes and hardly says anything). I could easily watch an entire film devoted to him and his sour-faced, bad tempered homosexual antics. But as it stands we only get him spitting into a burger and him trying to molest someone. But that's enough, I guess. However, there is another great Sea Bass moment. Just watch Sea Bass when Lloyd and Harry are trying to scam him. The way he points to himself and his 'boys' never fails to crack me up.Another supporting character rich in comedy is Mental the gangster. He has quite a few amusing moments, but the best one by quite some margin is when his phone conversation in a phone booth is interrupted by some bespectacled nitwit. The man is so geeky and so annoying that the punch that comes thundering through the glass not only induces laughs but also elicits cheers  you can't help but like this bloke. However, as likable as this mentalist is, die he must. And his death scene includes some of Carey's and Daniels' best acting. Just look at them when they spike Mental's burger. They're like kids  they can't suppress their mirth.Speaking of acting, it's not a surprise that Carey is so good at acting dumb, but it's something of a minor revelation that Daniels is so good at comedy. After all, before this, he was known for more serious roles. But here Daniels' allows his IQ to plummet and he more than holds his own with his more experienced counterpart.One of the most enjoyable things about Dumb and Dumber is how petty and bad tempered the two friends are ('You are one pathetic loserno offence')  some of the best scenes are the ones where they argue like school kids. A great scene happens near the end  Lloyd and Harry are arguing over Mary. They no longer want to be friends and Harry asks him where he has to sign. 'Right on my ass after you kiss it!' And I can't help but crack up at Lloyd's shooting fantasy when he sees Mary's husband. Both characters are borderline psychotic, which only makes the film even funnier.I also like how relentlessly horny Lloyd is. Just take the scene when he first meets Mary. The quasi-romantic music and the way Lloyd grabs his heart when Mary walks back into her house are bloody hilarious, as is the 'Goodbye, my love!' moment at the airport (also note Lloyd's reaction when he hugs his 'love'  the groan as he relaxes his body is disturbingly sexual). And I've also just remembered the 'Be strong' moment and the little sobbing sound he makes (man this film is funny!). But just as good as this is Lloyd's daydream as he drives. The way he sneaks a look at Mary's butt is priceless (and what a butt it is, too!). And then the schmoozing at his dinner party (if only lighted farts really did impress people at 'sophisticated' parties) and the fight at the restaurant. But although the fisticuffs are brilliant, there's a much smaller and funnier moment in this scene  note the way the waiter chucks Lloyd's plate onto the table and the way he carefully places Mary's; who says the film isn't subtle? But even though there are one or two gags which can rightly be declared as subtle, they kind of pale in comparison to the instances of bad taste. Just take the officer drinking his own urine ('give me the booze you pumpkin pie haircutted freak!') or Harry crapping his brains out. These are the showcase moments. But as good as these are, what keeps me coming back are the little things  Lloyd trying to buy a copy of 'Rhode Island Slut', Lloyd gagging when he sees his best friend hanging out with his 'girl', the 'big gulps' moment, the look on Harry's face when he finds out that his best friend has been wearing extra gloves and Lloyd burping in utter contempt when he gets stuck next to an insufferable woman at a bar. As dumb as the characters are, there's far too much great comedy for it to be written off as a dumb film  you've got to be smart to make stupidity as funny as it is here.",Null,0,1,24 February 2007
World Trade Center," The Hollywood take on 9/11
","World Trade Center is a film that hopes to gain importance simply by virtue of its subject matter. It thinks that because it's about 9/11 people will immediately respond to it. And while it's impossible not to be affected by certain aspects of the film, it really doesn't deserve some of the emotion it generates. It's a pretty cheap film  cheap in that while the magnificent United 93 presented a totally objective view of what happened on that plane, World Trade Center is always trying to pull strings.The most objectionable element of World Trade Center is the portrayal of Marine Kames. We first see him sitting before a huge crucifix, where he tells someone that god has given him special gifts. Then we see him getting a haircut. In this scene he's wild-eyed, like he's enjoying the chaos that is unfolding. But later, after turning up at Ground Zero to help out, and after talking to a rescue working about all the dust, he says, 'It's as though God put up a screen of smoke to prevent us from seeing something we are not yet ready to see.' What now? If someone spoke to me like that, I'd think they were insane. And then later on, when he finds the two trapped men, he allays their fears by telling them, in his best psycho GI Joe voice, that he won't leave them: 'We're Marines; you are our mission'. Even when he's helping people he can't help but sound like a massive tool.But most heinously of all, there's a moment near the end when he phones his workplace and tells them he won't be coming in. 'We're going to need some good men out there to avenge this.' And we then find out that the real person did two tours of Iraq. Erm, excuse me, but that's the wrong country. And anyway, for a film that is supposed to be so apolitical it doesn't send a particularly great message. Yeah, some nutters killed lots of people so let's go into this country that had nothing to do with it and, despite the fact that the country is completely boned because some nutjob is running it, bone it even more. Who cares if a few thousand civilians get caught in the crossfire? Oh, wait Something else I wasn't particularly keen on were the flashbacks the two trapped men experienced. Bathed in ethereal light, they played like sentimental tripe. Yes I know we tend to take memories and make them better than they are, and I can well imagine that if you're dying you're going to sentimentalise them to an even greater extent, but it just doesn't work in a cinematic context. I'm sure I would have responded more to these scenes if they were played and filmed more naturally.Indeed, the most powerful scene for me by far was the scene where Cage's wife talks to a black woman. The black lady says that her son operated the elevator in the Trade Center. She then says that the last time they spoke she'd shouted at her son for being late for dinner. She then breaks down. This scene is so much more powerful than all the rest because there's no bullshit about it. There are no tricks; it doesn't feel fake. Who cares about nutjob Marines praying to Jeebus for glorious vengeance? The real story that day was that a couple of thousand people got killed; people with friends and families. It's the pain of those friends and families that matters.But that leads me to one of the reasons why United 93 is so much more powerful than World Trade Center. In United 93 you watch the whole film knowing that the people on the screen are going to die. In World Trade Center, though, you watch the film knowing that the two guys are going to live. So one film takes the tragedy and confronts it head on and the other kind of brushes everything under the carpet. Yes the story in World Trade Center is worth telling, and yes the work of the rescue workers should be celebrated, but they deserve a better film than this, one that doesn't pussyfoot around as much.And I have to say, having seen a documentary about the men portrayed in this film, that their experiences were a lot more powerful there than they are here. There's quite a bit of bad acting going on in this film (in a couple of instances Cage's line delivery apes William Shatner's) and curiously enough, there's little drama (I have no idea how Stone did it, but he managed to drain all the life out of the situation). So the emotion that is generated when the two guys are found feels kind of undeserved. We're caught up because we feel empathy for the real people  the filmmakers, though, have earned nothing.The only person who really comes out of the film with any credit is Maggie Gyllenhaal. Her performance is probably the only one that feels like it could bear some relation to a real person. Her character is both strong and vulnerable, and she has the energy and life that everyone else is so sorely lacking. Plus she's wonderful in the scene where she's re-united with her husband. She plays the pregnant wife of one of the Port Authority policemen and they argue over what name they're going to call their daughter  it has a spontaneity and warmth that isn't present in many other scenes.But despite everyone's best intentions, I have to say that the film as a whole is a failure. It says nothing about good and evil, and it doesn't serve as a fitting tribute to the rescue workers or the people that died. It's a saccharine, Hollywoodised view of 9/11, and we need that like we need a hole in the head.",Null,0,0,22 July 2007
The Dark Knight," Better than Begins (spoilers throughout)
","The Dark Knight is an improvement on Batman Begins, but it's not the giant leap that people would have you believe. It has too many flaws. The final sequence, for example, is a gigantic mess. Every attempt is made to ensure that it's exciting, but the editing is all over the place and sometimes its not even clear what's going on.Then there's Two-Face. What a dull creation he is. Basically his girlfriend gets killed and he goes a bit nuts and then he goes on a killing spree. Sounds kind of interesting, doesn't it? It's not. The stuff with Harvey Dent previous to this is enjoyable, but Two-Face himself sucks a lot of the life out of the film. And that's probably because it's over too quickly. All Two-Face gets to do is whine, toss his little coin and then fall out of a building. It's over in a flash and you're left wondering why create this villain at all if you're going to do so little with him.And the make-up and CGI for his disfigured face is awful. The film goes to such lengths to create a realistic environment for these fantastical characters that the cartoony effects stick out like a sore thumb. I can remember reading somewhere that Nolan thought that a realistically scarred face would look too horrific, but he could have at least gone for something that didn't look like it was on an anatomy page in Encarta.And I was also distracted by Batman's cowl. It has a very weird shape, like Bale's head is the teat on the end of a condom, albeit it a black condom with bat ears. It's nowhere near as good as Keaton's costume in Batman Returns.But what did I like about the film? Well, pretty much everything else. It's mind-numbingly predictable to point to Heath Ledger's performance as the highlight, but it's most certainly true. His Joker makes Nicholson's look like a slightly eccentric, rather cuddly uncle. Ledger blows him out of the water.The best thing about Ledger's Joker is that there's no reasoning with him. He just wants to play his games and have a laugh. However, he has a very strange sense of fun. Fun for him is playing with the Batman and turning Gotham's citizens into criminals. He's a guy that gets nothing out of money or sex. Therefore it's impossible to squeeze him.The only problem with this is that it weakens Batman's character. You go through a whole film to establish how strong he is and suddenly you cut his testes off. In this film he's remarkably impotent. And it also must be pointed out that the Joker is smart to a ridiculous degree. His plans are incredibly complicated and they all go off like clockwork.But that being said, the character is still enormous fun. One of my favourite Joker moments has to be the pencil trick. Yep, that pencil really did disappear. And what about poor Brian the fake Batman? Not only does he get to star in his own video, but he also gets to smash into the Mayor's window. Nice.But it's also the small moments that make Ledger's performance great. I like it when he arrives at Bruce Wayne's party, looking for Harvey Dent. He begins interrogating the guests and grabs a bald guy by the head, asking him if he's seen the DA. The guy doesn't respond and the Joker widens his eyes and goes, 'No.' It's a great bit of acting. And I also loved it when he applauds Gordon's promotion.The rest of the cast don't get to have anywhere near as much fun, but they all do a good job. Bale is solid as always, as is Caine, Freeman and Oldman, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is a massive improvement over Katie Holmes. But better than all of these is Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent. He's cocky but believably decent as the incorruptible DA, and like Bruce Wayne you're seduced by him. But while you feel that the film is building up to something special with his tragedy as Two-Face, it never happens. Suddenly the script lets Eckhart down and his fall provides zero emotion. There's just not enough time invested in it. It could have been a whole film in itself.Fortunately, though, there are many wonderful distractions to ensure that you don't dwell too hard on this disappointment. The action, for instance, is superb. And once again Nolan excels with a wonderful car chase.However, my favourite bit in the whole film is a very small moment. Right after the Joker escapes from police custody we briefly see him hanging his body out of a squad car. There's no sound and the music is no more than a hum, but it's incredibly cinematic and says more about the character than almost anything else could. This is what makes the Joker's life worth living; running rings around other people and playing games with them.And Nolan must also be commended for some of the film's subtext. The Joker's videos kind of resemble the sorts of things Al Qaeda would make and the whole film asks how far would you go to try and re-establish control. Do you destroy everything you believe in just so that things can be the way they used to be? Of course this is the crisis that America faces where civil liberties are eroded in order to try and make the country 'safer'. The Dark Knight just takes it to an extreme.So while Nolan must be commended for the ambition of the project and for most of the film's execution, it's by no means the instant masterpiece it's been touted as. Yes it's the best Batman film that's been made, but it's not even close to being the best film of all time.",Null,5,10,29 July 2008
Into the Wild," Blind hero-worship of an idiot (spoilers)
","Christopher McCandless lived a silly life and died a silly death. Here was a guy who gave his savings to Oxfam, left home without uttering a word to his family and who thought salvation lay in the wilderness. Too bad, then, that he ate the wrong type of plant and carked it.All the time we're told what complete bastards McCandless' parents are. They drove Christopher into the wild. But what was their crime? Apparently they argued some, even lied a little and their children were born out of wedlock. Okay, they're not the best parents in the world, but do they deserve the harsh treatment that their son dishes out  no letters, no postcards, no phone calls? Well, if you're a massive jerk and you're somehow unable to comprehend that human relationships are more complicated than a simple 'they're good' or 'they're bad', then you may be able to build a case for young Christopher, but if you have any depth of feeling in your soul, you may well think that McCandless punished his parents beyond anything that is reasonable. And also remember that he never contacted his beloved sister. She got the silent treatment as well. However, we have a scene where Christopher goes to call her, but instead he gives his quarter to an old man who is running out of change. What a great guy, we're asked to think. See how he lends a helping hand to strangers. But what about his poor sister, the person who loves him most in the world? This apparently is his one feeble attempt to reach out and tell her that he's okay.But no, Christopher is determined to live alone in the wilderness - to find himself. He wants to escape from a sick society where people treat each other poorly. Hell, his parents even have the nerve to offer to buy him a new car and pay for a Harvard education. Those phonies. Those shallow fakers who give him a home to live in and money to spend. How disgusting they are.Okay, so fair enough, the parents that we're presented with here are stiff, middle class dweebs who are more interested in appearances than anything of any substance, but what had me shaking my head was the assertion that Christopher's disappearance made them better people. Suddenly they're thoughtful and united and in tune with one another. Yes, that's what every strained marriage needs  their children to put them through a couple of years of hell.But what I find most objectionable is the romanticising of the wilderness. Is this the only way that anyone can find themselves, by opening their arms and standing on the edge of a mountain and by kayaking down a river? Isn't there any other way? Apparently not. We even get a scene where Christopher, briefly stranded in LA, looks into a restaurant populated by smarmy bastards and sees a yuppie version of himself. You see what he'd become if he stayed in the city? Hunting moose and talking to hippies is the only way to become a rounded individual.But the disaffection with society in this film is incredibly adolescent. In one scene, Christopher and a buddy of his just start impotently shouting 'society!' Yeah, society sucks and the wilderness is great. The wilderness never starved anyone, ate anyone or froze their balls off. In the eyes of every bear and moose is truth and beauty, and on the cold streets of civilisation is a steady flow of lies and deceit.However, at the end, Christopher maybe finally begins to understand that his quest is full of crap. He writes something along the lines that happiness is meaningless if you don't have someone to share it with. It took you all that time to figure that out? That human connections are what make life bearable? You could have found that out back home, sitting on your couch in your underpants, stuffing Cheetos down your throat.But of course, it's the journey that matters, isn't it? And what a tedious journey it is. Christopher meets hippies and quirky foreigners (who are good) and men with badges (who are bad). He helps people like a shaggy-haired Littlest Hobo and enjoys the milk of human kindness. Well, he enjoys the milk of human kindness as long as the people are poor. Everyone who has no money in this film is an insightful, kind-hearted, itinerant poet. Plus none of the hippies he meets are smelly, ugly, incoherent bastards who drown in their own drug-fuelled nonsense. No, they're inspiring people, who plaster their vehicles with outdated sentiments like 'freedom', 'peace' and 'love'.But it's notable that there's a moment when even a bear won't eat Christopher. Supposedly the bear turns his nose up at him because the kid stays calm or perhaps because he's so sick he doesn't smell that good. But I'd like to think that the bear turns his nose up because it's BS he can smell, and lots of it.However, as we all know from Timothy Treadwell, bears don't mind a bit of BS, but alas the film can't even come close to the genius of Grizzly Man, a film that shows you're no closer to finding reality in the wilderness than you are on the city streets. The problem here is that Penn is celebrating McCandless' folly instead of investigating it. Not for one moment are we asked to consider that this kid is perhaps a bit of an idiot. We're meant to find his journey inspiring and his plight tragic. But instead it's neither of those things. And at the end his death is elevated to grandiose status (it's shot like he's ascending to heaven, that he's communing with god). But in reality his death is what happens when a deluded moron tries to live in the wilderness without a map or enough food.",Null,502,732,7 December 2007
Once Upon a Time in America," My favourite film (spoilers)
","The Godfather is undoubtedly the most acclaimed gangster film out there, but I'd take Once Upon a Time in America over it any day. In fact, I'd take Leone's film over any film full stop. It's just a beautiful film. It's a film about friendship, love, greed and time  all the good stuff.One of the most audacious things in the film is the way the exposition is delivered. Noodles (De Niro) is in an opium den, high as a kite, and he's woken up by a buzzing in his head. But then as he looks at a newspaper with the faces of some dead gangsters on the cover, the buzzing turns into the sound of a telephone. And the telephone rings as we're taken back in time. The first thing we see are dead bodies on a street, one whose face is charred beyond recognition. Then we see a party, where Noodles excuses himself to make a call. But when he picks up the receiver the ringing telephone on the soundtrack doesn't cease. Then we cut to a police station and see another telephone. Only when this one is picked up does the telephone stop sounding. It's a very elegant way of showing Noodles' betraying his friends and communicating that he's in the opium den because his betrayal is ringing in his ears.Just as elegant are the shifts in time. The film is wrapped around an elderly Noodles returning to New York after receiving a mysterious letter. He thought he'd escaped his mob life. But as he returns to his old home, we have extended flashbacks. And the transitions are beautiful. Indeed, one of them may even very well be my favourite bit in any film.The moment in question is when the old Noodles returns to Fat Moe's more than thirty years after he left. Noodles looks at some old photos of his friends and then wanders to the back of the establishment. Morricone's awesome score swells and Noodles stands on the lid of a toilet. He then pulls a peephole back and edges closer towards the hole. Through the other side we see his sad eyes and when we cut back we see what he's seeing. We see a young girl dancing in the back room of a bar  Noodles' beloved Deborah. And then when we see Noodles again it's the young Noodles. It's an amazing piece of cinema.And I do have to say that of all the sections in the film, I love the childhood scenes the most. There's just so much energy and life in these scenes. You have Noodles and his gang of degenerate friends burning down a newsstand, Noodles flashing his nymphomaniac neighbour, Patsy trying to buy a 'favour' from the aforementioned nymphomaniac by buying an expensive cake only to scoff it himself when he's made to wait on the stairs, and the scene where the urchins blackmail a policeman. These kids are little bastards, but somehow Leone infuses their scenes with such a degree of innocence. We love these kids. Therefore it's devastating when one of them, the smallest and perhaps most innocent, is shot down by a rival gangster. And when the child tells Noodles that he slipped just before he dies, it's powerful as hell. Finally the fun and games are over and the consequences of a criminal life are revealed.One of the consequences is that Noodles goes to prison for avenging his friend's death and for stabbing a policeman. But when he comes out things have changed between him and his best friend Max (James Woods). They just aren't on the same page any more. Noodles would rather talk to Deborah than take an interest in the criminal empire Max has built up in his absence. But despite his lack of interest Noodles does get involved. Indeed, during a robbery Noodles is asked to put a cork in a woman who wont shut up. And he does so literally.But this is a good example of a complexity in Noodles' character. He's an interesting mixture of a romantic and a thug. And an even better example of this is his reaction to Deborah leaving New York to go to Hollywood. This is the woman he loves, and he tries his best to woo her by taking her to a fancy restaurant and hiring it entirely for the two of them. But when she tells him that she's leaving he's devastated. We see him in the car completely heartbroken. But Deborah makes the mistake of giving him a consolation kiss that leads to a brutal rape. Leone got into a lot of trouble for saying that this was an act of love, but he's right in a way. What Noodles does is completely wrong, but he does it out of a sick, twisted, obsessive love. In that moment he'd rather destroy her than let anyone else have her.But it says something for Leone and De Niro that I care for this character. He does a lot of ugly things but he's human. And the scenes with the elderly Noodles are dripping with melancholy. 'What have you been doing all these years?' 'Been going to bed early,' replies Noodles. Since New York his life has stopped.And it's quite interesting that the confrontation at the end of the film centres entirely around dialogue. It's a world away from the guns of Leone's westerns.And the film's final image is perfect. We see Noodles in the opium den. He smokes, lies on his back and the camera closes in on his face. For a few moments he's pensive, but then he cracks a huge grin. His friends are dead and he's the one who betrayed them, but he's lost in oblivion. Finally he's free from everything. And of course, this hints that the film could indeed be some sort of opium dream, but that's another matter entirely...",Null,18,41,11 April 2006
Victory," Crap, but greatif you know what I mean (spoilers)
","Looking at it objectively, Escape to Victory is a lousy film. Its got bad acting, the story is hackneyed, the characters are cardboard cut outs and the sporting element contains every cliché and follows every convention of the genre. But entirely because of that, it's also one of the most enjoyable bad films ever made.You know reality means nothing in this film when we're asked to believe that Michael Caine is a football star. Here's a man with two left feet, who has a spare tire around his waste and who looks unfamiliar with the concept of running. He looks more out of shape than Tomas Brolin after a thirty-day bender at the local kebab shop. But no mind, the film desperately needs acting talent, so he's it. And he does a jolly good job of just shouting his way through the film.The only other capable actor is demon-slayer and Jesus himself, Max von Sydow. He's the 'good' Nazi who wants to put a game together between the German national team and the POWs. But while he can act, he too looks uncomfortable around a football (he's supposed to be a former international). Just look at the scene where he flicks the ball up with his big boots and passes it to Caine. It's obvious it's his double.Other than those two, though, and aside from a few of the British officer chaps, the acting talent on display is meagre to say the least. Not only do you have to suffer the agony of Pelé, Bobby Moore, John Wark and Mike Summerbee sharing a scene with actual dialogue (the exchange further confirmed my atheism), but you also have to watch Sylvester Stallone pretending to be French. And in one scene he even fools a German soldier into believing he's a French native, despite his not-so French accent. No wonder they lost the war.Further evidence of Nazi stupidity is when they're fooled by Bobby Moore's Hatch doll. Honestly, there's a scene, after Hatch escapes to contact the French Resistance, where the World Cup winner walks about with a big Hatch doll to fool his captors. It should make me hate the film, but it's so silly it's brilliant.That's a sentiment that runs throughout the whole of the film. Brilliant stupidity. I mean, why does Hatch, when he becomes the trainer and is talking about possible ailments the players might suffer from, almost immediately mention anal bleeding? What are these players up to? But I like the relationship between Caine and Stallone during the training sequences. If Caine is Graham Taylor, Stallone is Phil Neal. Hatch repeats everything his boss says like a parrot.But even better than that is the tracksuit moment. The entire team emerges from a hut in red uniform only to be greeted by jeers and wolf-whistles. It's sheer poetry  the Caine mince, the pugnacious 'V' sign and the defiant 'Up yours!' Beautiful. I also like it when Caine breaks his goalkeeper's arms so that Hatch can join the team and help the escape. It's the most stiff-lipped arm breaking scene I've ever scenewhich is something to applaud.But all this stuff is nothing compared to the game. This is where things get really good/bad/bloody brilliant. I mean, just take the traitorous Nazi commentator. He's English, but he's loving his fascist uniform and he adores the Fatherland. He's an evil propagandist. But he does give me an idea for a possible remake. If they ever do decide to take another stab at making the film his part should be filled by another fashion-conscious, nonsense-speaking Nazi  Ron Atkinson.Once the game starts, the Allies are almost immediately losing thanks to Hatch's goalkeeping. He's like David James; he's afraid of crosses. Plus he has a curious habit of tackling strikers with two-footed challenges. Unusual technique to say the least. But I love how clueless Hatch is. Not only does he have to ask where to stand for a corner kick, but he has to ask Caine about what happens during a penalty. 'I'm supposed to stop it?' 'Yeah, you're the goalie.' Genius.But the cheating Germans crock Co Prins and then do Pelé in  two players hack him at once. However, Bobby Moore scores and at half-time they're only losing 4-1. But damn Hatch wants to escape. But then Pelé appeals to him. 'Hatch, if we run now, we loose more than a game.' You see, if they'd escaped, the Allies would have been humiliated and the occupied people would have lost heart. The Queen Mother didn't win us the war; the Allied football team did. Look it up in your history books; it's true.'The Allies are playing above themselves', says Ron when the Allies make it 4-2. Traitorous idiot! But then it's 4-3. But then the cheating ref disallows a perfectly good goal. But then Pelé comes back on ('I feel good. I feel better.') and nets the second best overhead kick in the history of the world (Trevor Sinclair's against Barnsley was better). No, actually, he nets it about fifty times, because Max von Sydow sees it in his minds eye again and again and again in slow-motion and with twinkly music. Then he leaps up and applauds, just like Gorbachev in Rocky IV (want to break a totalitarian regime? Make them watch Stallone play sports). You see, football unites the world. No violence occurs because of it. It fosters nothing but feelings of love and harmony.Although I do have to say that the big 'V' for Victory that flashes up at the end of the film makes me want to give Herr Fritz a big Caine-style 'Up yours!' Oh yeah, and the dumb American saves a last minute penalty and the players escape by wearing big coats and peasant hats. Can you get to Switzerland in football boots?",Null,3,4,20 December 2005
Saw," Silly beyond belief (spoilers throughout)
","Saw is a film I was rooting for. It had the potential to be a grubby, nasty, eyesore of a film. But while it had gore and sadism in spades, it also had horrible acting, a terrible script and forgettable characters. Not even a man hacking off his own foot could make me overlook the tripe.Well, having said that, Cary Elwes hacking off his own foot did help somewhat, but the scene, rather than being traumatic, was a laugh riot. You have hysterical direction (you quickly cut from screaming man to screaming man  close-ups of screaming men, especially when you quickly go from one to another, for some reason, always cracks me up), camp acting from Elwes (throughout the film he chews the scenery, but here he chews on his shirt) and cut around the scene is a hilarious car chase between Danny Glover and the red herring bloke. The cumulative effect is mucho laughter.The car chase, though, I think, of all of the funny things in the film, was the funniest. It was possibly the most low-rent thing I've seen in recent cinema. And although I acknowledge the fact that the filmmakers were working on a paltry budget, it still doesn't make it any less funny when you film grown-men pretending to drive stationary cars that are not so carefully given life by a bit of smoke and jittery camera-work and editing. Rear-projection would have looked a million times more convincing.Another budgetary giveaway was the car park that looked like it was filmed in a barn and which contained about five cars. I know you're meant to suspend your disbelief, and if the film were good I'd be able to do that, but when your film is ridiculous, it's just another nail in the coffin.But sniping aside, I do appreciate what the filmmakers have done with so little money. Although visually a rip-off of Seven, it does look good and most of the effects are pretty decent. However, I just wish they would have spent a bit more money on the script and cast someone (anyone) else in Elwes' role.Elwes is an actor who can get by just as long as he's not required to emote  he can just about have a normal conversation. But once he's got to express anger or sadness or love, he's out of his depth. And so it is in Saw, sometimes with spectacular results.My favourite Elwes moment is when he recognises Zep (the red herring) in a photo and starts shouting like the man is alive inside it. Yes, if you shout loud enough the person in the photo WILL hear. (That's true.) But there's also the bit where the phone rings. He thinks it's Zep, so he shouts at the phone with camp venom. But it's his wife, so on a sixpence he changes into a doe-eyed husband, quivering with love and affection. Neither extreme is expressed in a believable way. But it doesn't help that Elwes has a weird thing he does with his voice. When he shouts he tries to boom like Brian Blessed, but when he expresses sadness or regret he talks in a child-like voice, almost like Joe Pasquale. It's a tad odd. And it makes his shooting of Adam bloody hysterical. 'You have to die. I'm sowwy. My family.' But Danny Glover is almost as bad. He goes metal when his partner gets killed by the fiendish Jigsaw Killer and tries to apprehend him on his own. But Danny Glover's portrayal of madness only extends to lots of incomprehensible shouting  there's a brilliant bit where he runs out of bullets and charges the armed Zep while shouting 'Aaaaaaarrrggghhh!!' But he does it again after the fight and as he runs out of the apartment to continue his pursuit. 'Aaaaarrrrrggggghhhhh!!' And of course you then cut to the car chase and the foot cutting, which makes the film so overripe in tone that the only result can be hilarity.But that's kind of a shame, as the first half is pretty promising. I especially love the ingenious traps. My favourite is the razor wire. Suicidal man rips himself to shreds? Magnificent! And the scene where the woman had to stab the man and root through his guts had me cackling with delight. But I do have to admit that neither sequence disturbed me as it should. Indeed, they both made me laugh. And this is purely because of how they were filmed. Large parts were speeded up to capture the frenzied emotions of the characters, but it's a technique that always gives me the giggles. It's just so over the top and hysterical, that rather than unsettle me, it distances me from the grisly proceedings and makes me enjoy them in a way I'm sure the filmmakers didn't intend.And that goes for the whole film. I enjoyed it, but not in the intended way. I was laughing at the camp acting, jumping up and down with glee as men got torn to shreds in wire and rolling about when things went crazy at the end  Adam has a lot of fire in his belly for someone who just got shot.And the villain also garnered laughs. He dressed like a goth (dig that robe and those gloves), moaned like a goth and hated the world like a goth. In fact, he probably was one. Wah-wah, I have cancer. Wah-wah, people don't appreciate their lives. Wah-wah, woe is me. I know most serial killers in films have BS reasons to justify their rampages, but this man made a fine art of it. And he sure was nimble for a cancer patientand could keep still for long periods of timeand was remarkably indestructible. Ah, but why apply logic to a film this silly? Just open your arms and let the shower of crap wash over you.",Null,17,27,15 January 2006
A Clockwork Orange," Excellent adaptation of a magnificent novel (spoilers)
","It's not often that you're asked to sympathise with a murderer and a rapist, but in A Clockwork Orange that is most certainly the case. We're asked to feel sorry for a young man who commits the most heinous crimes. And in the end it's hard not to feel for Alex, as he's more humorous, more charming and more alive than any of the other characters.The reason why Alex elicits sympathy is because, as immoral as he is, everyone else is that bit worse. Every authority figure, every person who should point the way, is either corrupt, self-serving, disingenuous or stupid. Just take Alex's parents. They're not bad people, but they're weak and lifeless; only a saint wouldn't take advantage of them. Then there's Deltoid, Alex's post-corrective adviser. He's a sneering, leering individual, who in a hilarious scene, grabs Alex by the privates (and then later he spits in Alex's face). Then you have the prison chaplain who spouts nonsense about hell and fireballs, the policemen who beat Alex when they interrogate him, the Minister of the Interior who wants to use Alex as a pawn to win votes, Mr Alexander who rescues Alex so that he can use him for his political campaign, Dr Brodsky who uses inhuman treatment to 'cure' Alex, and the Chief Guard in the prison who is a gurning fool. None of these authority figures inspire any confidence and none of them can be trusted.So compared to this lot Alex doesn't seem so bad. Indeed, he seems more like a child who indulges every whim than an adult who callously breaks the law. Everything is a bit of a lark.And it's hard not to derive a twisted sort of pleasure out of Alex's adventures. He does all the things people secretly fantasise about doing  stealing cars, smashing people's skulls, raping. And it's part of Kubrick's genius that he never judges Alex. He never wags his finger. Instead he shows everything from Alex's point of view  for him this is one giant laugh. And this also helps make the film more quietly disturbing. The rape scene, for instance, isn't at all graphic, but the joy it gives Alex and his droogs is genuinely unsettling. It's like Kubrick is challenging you to enjoy it, too, to prove that none of us are that far from behaving like animals.Another excellent scene is the fight between the two gangs. With smashed bottles in people's faces, with people hurled through tables and with people chucked through windows, its presented like something out of professional wrestling; it's funny. And there lies the danger. Most of us are only kept on the straight and narrow by a very thin thread. If only we could unprogram our morality, or if we'd never had it installed in the first place, we'd act like animals too. And who knows, we might have a great time doing it.But do the so-called civilised people behave any better? Not according to this film they don't. Perhaps the most despicable people are the doctors and scientists. They don't act out of cold-blooded wickedness, but instead out of a thoughtless sense of moral superiority. They want to eliminate crime but at the expense of freedom of choice. And who wants to live in a world like that? Yes misdeeds should be punished but goodness ceases to mean anything if it only becomes a self-protective reflex.And then there's the Minister of the Interior. He doesn't really care about crime. He doesn't want to solve the problem to make people's lives better. He only wants to do it so that he can win votes. He's contemptible.So in light of this it actually becomes something of a pity that Alex is conditioned against sex and violence. In the latter scenes you can't help but miss the old him. I mean, the old Alex wouldn't lick someone's shoe would he? But I have to say that this is one of my favourite scenes. I love how camp the actor is, how pathetic his insults are ('Hello, heap of dirt') and how twee the music is. Kubrick has a fantastic sense of humour. Plus it makes Alex even more pitiful.Not quite as much fun, but just as effective, is the scene where Alex finds out that Dim and George are policemen. Dim's 'Well, well, well, well, well' is priceless and the beating is absolutely brutal. Plus it further rams home the point about the police  what's worse, illegal thuggery or legalised thuggery? And it's also quite amazing that we end up feeling more sympathy for Alex than we do Mr Alexander. After all, Alex rapes his wife and cripples him. But Mr Alexander is another person who claims to be morally superior while being anything but  the scene with the wine is a piece of comic genius; Magee's over the top acting, Alex's attempts to be cultured and his final face plant in the spaghetti always makes me laugh.So therefore the end ends up being a celebration. I mean, ordinarily we should be upset that a rapist and a murderer has been freed, but compared to everyone else Alex is a ray of light. In a world where everyone is trying to control everyone else his freedom to be as viscous and vile as he wishes is a victory for all of us.And I do have to say I'm glad that Kubrick didn't film the final chapter of Burgess' novel. In the book, after his triumphant cure, Alex decides to settle down. The point of the chapter is that this whole thing can be seen as a phase Alex is going through. But while the point is more than valid, the execution is lacklustre. It's more than enough just to know that Alex is free to choose his future.",Null,0,1,27 May 2006
From Hell," Saucy Jack (spoilers)
","Studio films can't half be frustrating at times. On the one hand you get all the gloss but on the other you have to put up with 'stars' being shoehorned into the picture to satisfy the bean counters. Now most of the time the later isn't too much of a problem. I mean, sure it can be a little frustrating to have the same few people pop up in blockbuster after blockbuster, but despite what some snobs may say, a reasonable proportion of stars are stars for a reason  whether it be raw acting talent or mere charisma. But while Johnny Depp is a fine actor as well as a bankable star, he just isn't very good in From Hell.I don't know what went wrong, but Depp just doesn't seem all that comfortable in his role. Maybe he had to concentrate too much on the accent  if he did, then he still did a pretty bad job on that front  but even if he didn't, he still seems uncertain of himself. It's as if he doesn't know whether to play the role tongue in cheek or dead serious, and instead falls into some unsatisfactory middle ground.Not helping him too much is the fact that he didn't sell the whole tortured detective thing to me. Abberline is supposed to be a man with a past  like nearly 99% of detectives in films  but there was no real weight to the character. Yeah he may smoke opium and he may drink Absinthe, but it felt like style rather than substance. And while that may be the fault of the script or the direction, Depp still felt lightweight in this film. (Lightweight reminds me; I think the heavyweight Robbie Coltrane would have been excellent as Abberline. Or, alternatively, Robert Carlyle.) Then there's Heather Graham. Now Johnny Depp is fully deserving of his status as a star. Heather Graham, though, isn't. Therefore it's rather excruciating listening to her trying to deliver dialogue in a badly contrived accent and rather painful watching her try and play the hooker with a heart of gold. Such a stock character needs someone with a lot of acting talent to make it believable and interesting (maybe Samantha Morton or Emily Watson?). As it is, her character is incredibly dull to watch (and, annoyingly, the film denies us the pleasure of her brutal murder). Plus she looks silly alongside the other prostitutes. You go from believably haggard streetwalker to believably haggard streetwalker to Heather Graham, who's supposed to look the part because she doesn't quite have as much eye make-up as she usually does and because her hair isn't quite combed through. She's not at all convincing, and it's frustrating that the Hughes brothers had to cast her as a concession to the studio.But despite the two main stars being miscast, there's a lot of good stuff in the film. I especially like some of the comments on Victorian society. You've got the brutality of the medicine of the time (the woman being lobotomised and then swept under the carpet in the workhouse), sexual hypocrisy (a blind eye is turned to men using prostitutes but the prostitutes themselves are despised), class (the upper class police chief refers to a middle class doctor as having 'a cheap sort of intelligence') and prejudice. And it's the prejudice that produces one of the best scenes. There's a scene where the police chief is talking to Abberline about who they're looking for. Here are some of the chief's quotes: 'One thing's for sure, an Englishman didn't do it.' 'An educated man? That's preposterous. No well-bred man would do this.' 'What about the Jews?' At the time, when I was watching the scene, I got a kick out of it because it seemed like a Victorian twist on the 'stupid chief' scenes that you always see in 80s cop films. But after you see the ending, you realise that the stupid chief wasn't quite so stupid. Yet even though, or maybe because, the chief was part of the Masonic conspiracy (damn those Masons!), the scene works even better in retrospect. Not only does it expose the prejudice of the upper classes, but it exposes the hypocrisy too  a man who kills for an apparently noble cause can be looked down upon and disposed of, but a man who takes part by covering it up is honourably doing his duty.Stylistically, too, the film is excellent. There are loads of wonderful shots. My favourite is the one where you go from high up, down to street level and then underground to the Masons who are secretly running the show. I also like the blood red skies and the shots of Parliament. And the 'visions' are excellent as well. Oh, and I love the time-lapse shot after Jack kills one of his victims  and before that I like the way that The Ripper just vanishes from the scene like a phantom.And it's Ian Holm who delivers the best performance (although the whole supporting cast does a fine job). He's entirely charming as the kindly doctor and completely bonkers as Jack the Ripper  the heart scene is great, especially the fantasy element where his fellow doctors are applauding his work. And although Holm doesn't really seem physically big enough to play Jack, it doesn't become an issue because Holm is so great in the role. But I do have to say that the mystery element of the story was misjudged. The 'disguised' Ripper voice is obviously a hushed Holm. But it really doesn't matter. The mystery is revealed with quite a bit of time to go (I dig the creepy black eyes) and the fun is in the bloody carnage  the murders are suitably nasty.But one thing remains: the film would have been a lot better if Jack would have been allowed to dice Heather Graham.",Null,2,4,3 October 2005
Total Recall," Somewhat dated but it still holds up (spoilers)
","To call Total Recall an intellectual action film would be going too far. After all, this is a film with a three-titted whore, a midget hooker and a body count only Harold Shipman could dream of. Plus it has Arnie one-liners and tons and tons of blood. But despite all this, buried underneath the sleazy, bloodstained exterior there's a smart film trying to get out. Issues of reality and identity are all dealt with. But they're never dealt with at the expense of someone getting their head blown off.Watching it back, it's quite pleasing to remember just how violent action films used to be. Here you have men getting spiked in the neck, people getting axed and a man getting a pole of some sort shoved through his face. And that's just in one scene! The violence here is bloody and over the top, and in my opinion, much better for it. I mean, action films these days have become rather sanitised. There's just a feeling that you've seen it all before. But how many times do you get to see a man have his arms ripped off as he dangles from a lift? And how many times do you get to see that and have Arnie toss the arms away while delivering a quip? Only once.And then there's the bit where Michael Ironside shoots the three-titted whore in the back. Beautiful! I mean, this is meant to be a bad, bad man. And what better way to generate loathing (and secret admiration) than have him shoot a mutant hooker while her back is turned.But one of the most delightful bits of insane violence is when the midget whore stabs Ironside's lackey. You have to ask yourself whether you're shrooming your tits off. But no, it happens and then the midget stands on top of the bar and opens fire with a machine gun. Verhoeven is clearly a twisted man mental, but I can't help but admire him.Also worthy of praise is the shootout on the subway. Arnie is fleeing from the bad guys and tries to haul ass up the escalators. But more bad guys appear at the top. As everyone starts shooting, an innocent person gets killed in the crossfire. Arnie then uses the bloke as a human shield  he gets penetrated more times than a pretty boy in a prison shower  and tosses the piece of meat into the path of the bad guys below. I can't help but salute the complete utter lack of sentiment.I also salute the fight between Arnie and Sharon Stone. I mean, usually fights between women and men in action films are death  yeah, I can believe than an anorexic model can hurt a man double her size  but it at least keeps things relatively believable by having Stone hit Arnie a couple of times in his brain (his testicles). But what makes it a joy is that after the fight, Stone tries to buy some time by offering to tie herself up and let Arnie have his way with her. You know, for old times sake. It's something of a surprise that Der Gropenfuhrer doesn't take her up on her generous offer, but Arnie does knock her outwhich is even better.And there's another bit of violence that cracks me up. The evil mutant Benny, in some sort of digging machine, is attacking Arnie. Arnie then grabs a huge drill and rams it through the side of the vehicle while screaming 'Screw you!' at the top of his lungs. It's one of the few bits of possible homoeroticism in a film that is remarkably ungay for an Arnie flick.But there is another little bit of possible gayness in the film. Just take the relationship between Hauser (Arnie's evil alter-ego) and Cohaagen (Ronny Cox). They hug enthusiastically in a video message and then Cohaagen has a big strop when he finally realises that Hauser isn't coming back  he kicks a tank of goldfish over. It seems like he's lost more than a friend.But Ronny Cox is excellent in the film. Sure he's basically playing the same character he played in RoboCop, but he always makes an excellent villain. And I love the scene where he's going to have Quaid turned back into Hauser and have Melina 'fixed'. His dialogue with Arnie is wonderful. 'You get to f*** her every night, that's right. She's going to be Hauser's babe.' And then when asked what to do with all the people that are suffocating because he's cut off the air, he replies, 'F*** 'em.' That's a proper movie villain.However, I don't think the film is in the same class as RoboCop. For one, Total Recall now looks rather dated (look at the 'futuristic' cars) while RoboCop seems pretty timeless, and plus the balance between smarts and action is a bit more even in RoboCop.But that's not to say that Total Recall is a dumb film. One of the obvious pleasures is trying to work out whether the whole thing is a dream or not. After all, when Quaid goes to Rekall to have his 'ego trip' everything the salesman says in his pitch actually happens  the whole plot is given away in one scene. And then at the end you have a white out rather than a fade to black. This could suggest that Quaid is waking up or even being lobotomised. But although it's something that's pleasing to think about, the film is more concerned about action than ideas. And so that makes the film a minor success rather an overwhelming success like RoboCop.",Null,8,14,5 June 2006
Rocky," The first one (spoilers)
","When you've spent so long watching the ridiculous (but glorious) excesses of Rocky III and Rocky IV, you kind of forget how down to earth the original film is. To be sure it can't exactly be called gritty, as it's something of a grown-up fairytale, but at least it has its feet somewhere near the real world.The film starts with Rocky fighting in some fleapit. He doesn't really seem to care. He's not trying. But then near the end, his opponent, the fabulously named Spider Rico, headbutts him. This gives him the eye of the tiger and he knocks the guy out. When he's motivated, Rocky has it in him to achieve great things.But how do you summon that will when your life is so pitiful? Rocky lives in a nasty apartment ('It stinks!'), works as a small-time heavy for a local crook, trains at a run down gym, walks the cold, miserable streets of Philadelphia and awkwardly tries to woo the shy Adrian at the local pet store. It's not much of an existence.One of the best scenes is when Mickey comes crawling to Rocky at the Italian Stallion's apartment asking to train him. Previously Mickey has considered Rocky nothing more than a bum and has even thrown all his stuff out of his locker. But with the World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed picking Rocky as his next opponent in a gimmick New Year's bout, Mickey tries to get a piece of the action. He spends lots of time selling himself, telling Rocky about his experiences years ago as a boxer. He even shows Rocky pictures. But all the time Rocky can't even look at him, and when Mickey is showing him his photo, he plays darts. It's quite a cruel scene, although you can understand Rocky's anger. Like he says, he needed Mick's help ten years ago.But the scene gets even crueller. As Mickey is talking, Rocky goes to the toilet. Mickey speaks to the door and mentions that he's 76-years-old. We realise that this is his last chance at a title fight. But with Rocky still in the toilet, Mickey goes to leave the apartment. But as he's doing so, apparently thinking he's already gone, Rocky emerges from the loo. However, seeing that Mickey is still there, he turns around and walks back in. It's a real punch in the balls and we finally see how vulnerable Mickey is. And then when Mickey is walking down the stairs Rocky rants and raves about how his apartment stinks. It's actually an excellent piece of acting from Stallone and it's the one time that Rocky acts like a heel  even when he's trying to collect money as a heavy he's still pretty nice. But Rocky can't be mean for long and chases after Mick to presumably say sorry and ask him to be in his corner  filmed in a long shot, there's an excellent detail when Rocky finally catches up to the trainer; before Rocky embraces him, Mickey backs away like he's frightened. Despite how loud he is, he's still only a frail old man.Another fabulous scene is the one at the ice rink. Yes it's goofy, but that's part of Rocky's charm. He's a lovable innocent, always talking and always dispensing incoherent advice. He even says that he and Adrian make a fine couple, what with him being dumb and her being shy  as Rocky puts it, they fill gaps; they make up for each other's shortcomings. And their scenes are always sweet and well performed.There's only one scene where things turn a bit queasy and that's the scene where Rocky takes Adrian back to his place. Rocky shows off his muscles by stripping down to a wifebeater vest and Adrian mentions that she's never been alone in a man's apartment before. You kind of feel scared for the poor girl, what with this horny beefcake relentlessly coming onto her. The lovable Rocky suddenly seems a pit pushy and predatory. But eventually everything works out. However, in a later scene, the tables are turned. Rocky's training for his title fight and Adrian wants some sweet loving. She keeps on pestering the guy, determined to ruin his chances of performing well in his fight. I mean, as Mickey says, 'Women weaken legs.' Therefore Rocky has to briefly push her away  she can make up for her barren years after the fight.The fight itself is what you'd expect from a Rocky film: enjoyable but silly. Sure it doesn't descend into the cartoon brutality of the later films, but you still have men pounding each other mercilessly for 15 rounds (boxers were real men in the 70s  none of this 12 rounds nonsense). But even though it can't compare to the fights in Raging Bull or subsequent boxing films, the ending is hard to beat. Rocky manages to stand toe to toe with the champion and not humiliate himself, and by refusing to stay down when he gets knocked to the floor in the 14th round, he finally proves his self-worth. Yeah he doesn't win the fight but he regains his self-respect, which is a major victory in itself.And the ending with Rocky and Adrian embracing, and with the image paused at the greatest moment of Rocky's life, sweeps you off your feet and puts a massive smile on your face. Yes the Rocky films would subsequently go off into la-la land and any notion of reality would be smashed in the face, but at that moment the love of a good woman and the restoration of a man's spirit is a bigger victory than winning a boxing title. Of course Rocky didn't deserve to triumph over Taxi Driver at the Oscars, but I don't begrudge him his victory too much. Rocky is an underdog tale that wins you over with hard work and good old-fashioned working class charm.",Null,0,0,29 July 2008
Titanic," Big and dumb (spoilers)
","The Abyss should have served as an ominous warning. As enjoyable as that film is, when it came to the relationship between Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio it contained some of the most risible dialogue committed to film. Thankfully, though, it was only a small part of the story. However, with Titanic, the romance is front and centre. It's what everything hangs upon.Anyone familiar with James Cameron should know that he's terrible at writing anything that can be vaguely construed as romantic. As well as The Abyss, you have Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese's courtship in The Terminator. Full of hackneyed dialogue, puppy dog looks and embarrassing sex, it's the only weak link in an otherwise excellent film. But with Titanic you have to swallow scene after scene of it, until you end up puking all over yourself like a tramp on a park bench.One of the most laughable scenes is when Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) shows Rose (Kate Winslet) his artwork. His portfolio is full of nudie drawings. And there's one girl that he seems particularly fond of. But when Rose suggests that maybe he and this woman had a thing going on, he laughs it off, saying that she was a one-legged prostitute. Why should this stop him? It didn't stop Paul McCartney.But earlier in the scene Jack says that this woman had beautiful hands. He's about as convincing as an artist as Denise Richards is as nuclear physicist. And later on, when he draws Rose in the buff, he's supposedly so professional that he doesn't try anything on  there are no sleazy attempts to give her one. What kind of artist is he? But you can hardly blame Jack. He looks about twelve  he's probably terrified that Rose is going to crush him to death with her bountiful bosom. Indeed, when he draws her, he seems to be doing his best to ignore her womanly curves  all the hair flicking and concentrated glances are a blatant attempt to either ignore the rod that is pitched in his trousers or to keep him from crying in fear.However, as hard as Jack tries to avoid sleeping with Rose, she eventually traps him in some ye olde car. She even asks him to take her to the stars (quality dialogue, Jim!). And there she has her wicked way with the timorous youth. Poor guy. He even looks close to tears as he lies trembling on top of her. I don't know why he reacts in such a way. If he's a virgin, as his actions and general attitude suggest, he should be doing penile handstands for scoring such a fine piece of ass.But as risible as the romance is, the thing that irritated me the most was one of Jack's friends  some Irish guy called Tommy who he meets on the ship. He's meant to be a lovable, salt of the earth type guy, but I just wanted him dead. Indeed, the bit where he gets shot by one of the White Star Line officers genuinely had me cheering. And he gets shot after calling the White Star Line guy a 'Limey bastard'. England 1 Ireland 0. But this Tommy character is meant to be someone we can root for. But instead he's a selfish, mealy-mouthed, drunken idiot. To hell with him.And the whole idealising of the Irish is a major problem I have with the film. They're all wonderful people. The English, though, by and large, are scum. They're either cowardly, psychotic or brandy drinking fools. The only Englishman who comes out half okay is the Captain, and even he crashes into an iceberg and carks it in the end.But back to the idealising of the Irish  the music is insufferable. It's that whole Enya-style pseudo-Gaelic crap. I wanted to stab myself in the ears with a pencil. And then, of course, there's Celine Dion. What a rancid song that is at the end. It's like being sodomised by a rhino.The only character I sort of half-liked was Billy Zane's lackey. But that's because he's a total bastard. He falsely plants evidence on Jack, punches him in the gut and acts like a jerk at every opportunity. What a guy. And I guess Billy Zane (a.k.a. Kelly Brook's penis) is okay as well. Although I do have to say that his face freaks me out somewhat. It's got a plasticy, Michael Jackson-style look about it. Plus he seems to be wearing lots of eye-liner. But I do enjoy his general wretchedness, especially the way he survives the sinking. He kidnaps a child and hops onto a lifeboat, declaring that he's all the kid has in the world. To hell with your self-righteous Irishmen and fop-haired artists, this is what we need  hammy, rubber-faced industrialists who are only interested in saving their own skins.But unfortunately Kelly Brook's penis can't save the film. It's a tedious, terribly written mess that has one of the most risible wraparound stories seen in cinema. I really have no idea how that old lady got an Oscar nomination. I think the Academy were just impressed that she hadn't snuffed it yet. But at least the very end gives us hope that the Rose character dies. She lies there on her bed surrounded by her pictures and then returns to the Titanic and all the people who died that night. Is she now stuck on that ship, locked in sweaty, teary union with her wretched boy-toy for the rest of eternity? One can only hope.",Null,3,10,11 August 2007
The Untouchables," A western with fedoras and Tommy guns (spoilers)
","The Untouchables has little to do with reality. It's almost entirely a work of fiction. But that fact doesn't matter one bit. The historical characters are just a conduit for a simple tale of good and evil, one that, if anything, is more a western than a gangster film (albeit a western with fedoras and Tommy guns).The primary thing that makes me think of The Untouchables as a western is Ennio Morricone's score. Sure, what with his magnificent work with Sergio Leone, he's forever associated with the genre, but just listen to the music over the end credits. That's not music from a gangster film. Music that big and music that majestic belongs to a western. And then of course you have the bridge scene. Yeah you don't need to be a genius to see the horses and think of a western, but again the music gives it that feel.And of course there's the fact that you've got a posse of lawmen trying to kick some corrupt hoodlum out of town. Ness may be trying to bring law and order to the streets of 1920s Chicago, but it could easily be some dusty Midwest hellhole at the end of the nineteenth century.But talk of the film being a western is really beside the point. The only thing that really matters is whether the film works, and it works like gangbusters.However, some of the film's positives, the things that make it so watchable, are directly related to its shortcomings. For instance, the film is corny as hell. Just take the end scene where Capone's lawyer decides to change his plea. It didn't happen and it wouldn't happen, but who cares? This is a film where good triumphs over evil. This is a film where a man can survive having the entire contents of a Tommy gun magazine unloaded into his belly and live long enough to impart vital plot information. This is a movie with a capital M, and because De Palma is an excellent director, and because you care about the characters, the film transcends reality. It just isn't needed.Perhaps the shortcoming that works best is Kevin Costner's blandness. His Ness is a massive square. 'Let's do some good.' But in the context of the film, it works brilliantly. I mean, here's a man with a shockingly happy family  he's probably the only 'cop' (yes I know he's not actually a cop) in the movies who has a wife who doesn't nag him to death  and who makes speeches about purity. He's a knob. He's a stick-in-the-mud. He's Rex Banner. Therefore it's even more satisfying when he throws the book out of the window and starts killing gangsters in cold blood. He's not the first movie character to realise that laws get you nowhere. True justice can only be obtained by breaking noses and throwing men off buildings.Then there's Sean Connery. He's the grizzled, seen it all cop who throws homespun advice at his young apprentice(s). Seriously, every line of dialogue contains some nugget of useful information. He's wiser than Gandalf, Gandhi and Yoda all put together. But somehow Connery makes it work. Not once does it grate. He's kind of like your dad. He's got an answer for everything. Although my dad has a much better accent. (He also becomes Ness' surrogate father. Just watch the rage bubble forth when Nitti insults Ness' daddy. He doesn't mind that Nitti has shot a bailiff and killed two innocent people. He only loses the plot when Nitti disparages his deceased surrogate pop. I just wish that the 'Cause you killed my friend' line was changed to 'Cause you killed my daddy.' That would have been much better. But speaking of that moment, I crack up at the way that Costner says that line. He's a square to the end. And another square delivery is when he has to kill the gangster in the shed. 'What is this; a game?' Oh, the humanity.) Another shortcoming that works brilliantly is the fact that De Palma rips off (or should that be 'homages'?) Battleship Potemkin. Really it should signify a paucity of original ideas, but hey, a baby rolling down steps is timeless  he's trying to preserve purity; do you see? And De Palma gets extra points for having the bloke with a broken nose get blow away by a pump action shotgun and then having random sailors get shot in the crossfire in the shoot out that follows  I don't know why but I can never get enough of innocent people getting shot in crossfire; it's a sickness I have.And yet another thing that shouldn't work is Wallace. A short, bespectacled accountant turned untouchable? That should be awful. But here's it's brilliant. Too bad that he gets killed, though. I guess it just shows that when vertically-challenged accountants begin to get cocky, they get whacked. And I'm also impressed that Nitti manages to write his bloodstained message in double quick time. He must have done that before.Other bits of genius than transcend the material include the old man fight (I love it when Malone kicks the bloke in the balls), the corrupt Irish cop (I keep expecting him to say, 'Where's me lucky charms?'), the prolonged death of Malone (De Palma cuts the scene to opera, just in case you thought it was a gritty, accurate depiction of events), the way that Ness' 'pure' existence (Ness himself became an alcoholic) is juxtaposed against Capone's decadent lifestyle, the 'Poor Butterfly' bit and Capone giving a motivational speech before bashing someone's brains in. Essentially it's a film of clichés, but when clichés work as well as this, who gives a damn?",Null,2,4,18 October 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," The Matrix Retarded (spoilers)
","The second instalment of the Matrix trilogy takes all the excitement and energy of the first and flushes it completely down the toilet. In its place you're given turgid politics, ludicrous amounts of pseudo-philosophy and an unconvincing romance. It finally becomes clear that the Matrix has disappeared up the Wachowskis' arses.But what's most criminal of all is that the action is dull. After all, I'm not one of these sad teenagers that give a damn above the 'mythology' of The Matrix or the crappy philosophy. I have no desire to dress up like a knob and wear sunglasses indoors while practising bedroom kung fu. All I want is a decent story and some decent action. But instead you get a moronic story and lacklustre action.The most hyped piece of action is the car chase. Supposedly it was going to be the best car chase of all-time. It was going to change our attitude to cinema. Instead what you get is a bit of gun firing and one or two cars flying up in the air. It's the sort of thing you've seen in millions of films before, and often done much better than it is here. And as for being the 'Greatest Car Chase of All-Time', don't make me laugh. You'd have to be a moron to think that it could stand up to The French Connection or Bullit or Ronin. I even prefer the car chase in The Rock and I hate that sequence. I mean, at least it has the absurd zoom in, zoom out camera trick to fuel my rage. Here I was just apathetically shrugging my shoulders.The only decent bit of the car chase was the Ducati. What a beautiful bike. Oh, and Moss isn't a bad bike either. Seriously, all that money spent on special effects and your eyes still gravitate to an Italian bike and a woman's arse.But much worse than the car chase, which I'm merely apathetic to, was the fighting. Sweet Jesus the fight scenes were dull. All they consist of is a bit of flying about and tons of blocking. It's rare that anyone lands a punch. It's like they're playing Patty Cake. And most of the time the action serves no purpose. There's one bit where Neo (why does it always sound to me like people are addressing him as Neil? 'You're the one Neil') fights hundreds of Agent Smiths. They fly about a bit and do tons more blocking. Occasionally someone lands a punch but then when the person goes flying into all the Agents you get an absurd ten-pin blowing noise. But then after this rubbish computer graphics demonstration, Neo just flies off. So what the hell was the point? I think the answer is a couple of sentences back. It's just to show off what the computer geeks can do. 'Hundreds of Agent Smiths? That would be so kewl!' Sod the fact that the action has no consequences or that it does nothing to help drive the narrative forward. It's empty grandstanding and empty padding.Another dull action scene is the one where Neo fights lots of henchman in some French bloke's house. The turgid fighting is there but Neo can also stop bullets in midair. How can you care about someone that's invincible  especially someone that's both invincible and dull? One of the most unintentionally funny Neo scenes is where he has to kiss Monica Bellucci. Apparently she has to suffer being with some dull French bloke (who bores the audience to death in one of the million half-witted dialogue scenes) so she wants him to kiss her like he kisses Trinity. It's hilarious the way Reeves enters the Shatner school of acting. He looks at her and you can almost hear his thoughts, 'Kiss? IIdon't understand. It'sillogical.' But of course the reason that the scene's in the film is so that fanboys can soil their pants with fantasies of a quality of woman they'll never touch in a million years.Which brings me to the sex scene in the film. What a load of rubbish. You get more erotic movement out of an earthworm. And what kind of man is Neo? He almost cries when he comes. Although, having said that, the drums that play during the rave would probably make me cry too. All the party needed were whistles and glow sticks.But you see, the reason that sensitive, caring Neo gets emotional, is because he's worried about Trinity. Even though the two have no chemistry whatsoever. And just to show what an idiot he is, he chooses saving her over saving the world. How selfish can you get? But worse than the action, the sex, the sub-Stargate SG1 politics, the horrendous dialogue, the half-assed philosophy and the bad CGI (CGI Neo is just as unconvincing as the flesh and blood Neo) is the scene with The Architect. Nonsense dialogue gushes from his mouth, dialogue that in a deep and meaningful way is supposed to bring fresh revelations about The Matrix (there's talk of 'The Source' and other 'The Ones' and rebooting) but instead of being a speech on the nature of freedom of choice and all that jazz (if he's the Wachowski's idea of god, then god is more of a tool than I previously thought), it's merely a convoluted B-movie way of getting the hero to choose between saving the world and the girl. Of course Neo chooses the girl. Ergo, he's exactly the same as every hero out there. He loves his girl more than humanity. Idiot.",Null,0,2,1 December 2005
Rosemary's Baby," Superb but not particularly scary (spoilers throughout)
","Even though I think Rosemary's Baby is a fantastic film, I wouldn't really class it as particularly scary. If anything it's more of a dark comedy. Pregnancy is the joke and giving birth to the child of Satan is the punch line.But that's not to say that the film doesn't have its moments. The dreams are certainly creepy. Indeed, the way that Polanski films Satan having sex with Farrow with a bunch old Satanists watching would probably put the willies up most expectant mothers (so to speak). But then again, maybe that's my problem as regards finding the film scary. I'm never going to be giving birth, so I'll never know what it's like to be in that position.However, the film does do an excellent job of portraying the helplessness of pregnancy and the paranoia that can come about with no longer having control of your own body. Rosemary starts the film as an able woman, a woman who can choose an apartment and make decisions, but once she's pregnant she's ruled by doctors, nosey neighbours and her husband. Suddenly she's passive and suddenly her own importance is downgraded. It's as if she's a mere incubator.I'm sure that's something a lot of women must feel when they're pregnant. They must feel like conduits. But Rosemary's Baby takes that idea and takes it to extremes.One of the most amusing things about Rosemary's Baby is its Satanists. Here you have a coven populated mainly by wrinklies and old codgers. Never before have old people been so evil. But then again, are they really that evil? I mean, Rosemary's neighbours provide her with chocolate moose and herb drinks. What's wrong with that? Well, I guess there's a bit of a moral failing when the moose knocks Rosemary out so that Beelzebub can rape her. And I suppose Satan could have at least been a gentleman and date-raped her the old-fashioned way - with a drink and some Rohypnol. But they're mere formalities. And besides, the result would have been the same. But I do like the way that Rosemary doesn't eat all the knockout moose and is partially aware of having sex with the Devil. It adds to the weird helplessness of the scene. The whole thing is like a night terror. Indeed, despite thinking it's real while experiencing it, she puts it down to a dream. After all, it's too crazy to be true, isn't it? Watching the film again it's fun seeing how the conspiracy works. I mean, when you first watch it, you're not sure whether Rosemary is just going insane. You don't know whether it's mere paranoia. But while the weird chanting through the walls stuck out during the first viewing, when I watched it again I noticed how Rosemary's husband goes off to meet alone with their Satanist neighbours. He's obviously being seduced. Then there's the offhand way that Minnie (one of the neighbours) asks whether Rosemary wants children. It's done in such a light way  Minnie herself doesn't even seem interested in the answer  that when you first view it, you kind of miss this obsessive interest. But you've also got the herb drink, the doctor, the moose, the way that her husband runs off to tell the neighbours about the pregnancy and the way that one of her friends, an old man who is the only voice of dissent when it comes how the pregnancy is handled, goes into a coma and dies. Rosemary is right to be paranoid. Things are going on behind her back.And that's part of the film's genius, especially in the way it's directed. Rosemary is the focus of everything. She's in every scene and everything is from her viewpoint. Therefore you can never be sure, when you first watch it, whether it's just a fantasy. And Mia Farrow is a big factor in the film's success. Among some actresses there could be a tendency to overplay things, but she plays it as a woman desperately trying to keep control. Only when things go absolutely insane does she resort to hysterics. Consequently, you like her and you want everything to work out for her. And it's also quite winning the way that she gets her haircut during her pregnancy to try and reaffirm her identity and importance, and the way that she talks to her baby when she starts to seriously loose it. She's a woman pushed to the limit, but she's a woman who fights it admirably.And that likability works for the ending. When she finally sees her baby and what it is, you wonder what she's going to do and you actually care. And the fact that she doesn't kill it and that she begins to embrace it (by rocking the crib with an almost misty look on her face) makes it rather sad. But when you think about it, it's not too absurd that she'd become a mother to Satan's child. I mean, just look at some kids today. Would this kid really be much worse? And I'm sure that being Satan's concubine must have certain perks. But seriously, how often do you hear, 'he's got a face only a mother can love'? And people always speak of 'little devils'. The maternal instinct is strong.But although the ending is creepy and sad, at the same time I find it funny. Just take the way that all the old fogies start shouting, 'Hail Satan!' Or the way that the oriental guy snaps photos. Then there's the woman rocking the crib and fact that the scheming neighbour says that the baby has his father's eyes. There's a lot of dark humour in the film and the ending is where it comes through strongest. But that doesn't mean that the joke is funny for poor Rosemary.",Null,5,8,5 December 2005
War of the Worlds," Half-decent film; lousy ending (spoilers throughout)
","There are three endings that you should avoid at all costs, endings which all reek of a massive cop-out. The first ending that you should avoid is: everything was a lie. The second ending that you should avoid is: everything was a dream. And the third ending that you should avoid is: god saved us. Now there are notable exceptions to all of those, but by and large, they're incredibly unsatisfactory. And so it is with War of the Worlds. Faced with an indestructible force, what saves mankind? Courage? Resolve? An unbending will to survive? No. Germs. And if that isn't bad enough, apparently germs that god made. So let me get this straight. God made humans. Then god, you know, for a bit of a laugh, decided to have our planet rampaged by aliens. Then, after he'd had his fun, he allowed the germs that he made destroy the pesky little critters. What a nice bloke.But the whole pathetic god get-out clause reminds me of the awful Signs. Don't these aliens prepare? Don't they think things through? You know, if you're going to invade a planet that is two-thirds water, and you don't like water, shouldn't you wear a suit in case it rains? And if you're not resistant to Earth's germs, shouldn't you again wear some sort of protection? I would have thought that that would be one of the first things that a superior race would think of. But films show that aliens never learn. Our invaders are always inter-galactic imbeciles.However, I'm sure people point to H.G. Wells' and say that this stupid ending is in the book (as it is in the 50s adaptation). Well, a bad ending is a bad ending, whether it be in a book, film or play. But I can understand why it's there. Wells wrote himself into a corner. I can imagine him getting excited as he creates an indestructible force. What a great idea! What fun! The only problem is when you get to the end. How do you destruct the indestructible? Oops. It's a problem that has plagued every film of this sort. I've already mentioned Signs, but also consider Independence Day. That had to go to ridiculous lengths too. 'What can destruct the indestructible aliens? Guns? No. Big guns? No. Huge guns? No. Bombs? No. Massive bombs? No. Nuclear bombs? No.' 'What, then?' 'Er. Er. Era computer virus!' 'With plenty of Apple product placement thrown in?' 'Er, yeah, sure.' 'Sold!' So if films have taught me anything, it's that if aliens invade, just run and pray, because if you run fast enough and pray hard enough, the almighty, in his infinite wisdom, might allow you to survive and let the viruses do their work.But while I loathed the ending, I did find much to enjoy in the film. In particular I liked the decision to see the invasion from a narrow focus  through a family. In Independence Day and the 1950s The War of the Worlds, the scope is a lot broader, meaning that everything is less frightening. Here, though, you're just as much in the dark as the family, and that works to the films advantage. In fact, I wish it would have steered even further in this direction, as the one explanation that is given for the invasion is ridiculous. The aliens buried machines under the planet's surface millions of years ago? Why didn't they just take the planet then? Why did they wait? And how come no one found these machines? You know, when you're building subway tunnels and laying water and power lines, alien machines are the sort of thing that might strike you as peculiar. But as ridiculous as this is, the tension is expertly built up and the invasion is fun.What I liked most about the film was, unsurprisingly, the action. Call me sadistic, but watching people get vaporised is always going to work for me. And I thought the design of the tripods was excellent. I haven't seen such good CGI for a long time. In fact, some of the shots were just outright fantastic. The harbour scene, in particular, with the machines appearing on the horizon and from under the water, was superb. Then there were the little details of the river flowing with bodies and the train rushing through the station while on fire. That sort of 'normal' horror makes the whole thing seem a lot more real.Pity, then, that the characters don't elicit more sympathy. They're all rather bland. And the Tim Robbins sequence could have been better. It should have been more sinister. As it is, he seemed to be playing that same character as the one that he played in Mystic River. Basically, when he tries to look threatening, Robbins looks like he's going to start crying. But despite that, and despite the fact that the scene with the aliens and the alien probe was the same as the Raptor scene in Jurassic Park, it did have a fair amount of tension. Spielberg is still excellent with set-pieces. And I liked the fact that the aliens were so nasty. The blood was a nice touch. How can you not dig an alien species that terraforms the Earth with human blood? I just wish that Spielberg would just stop sugarcoating his endings. If the germs and god weren't bad enough, there's the fact that Cruise is reunited with his ex-wife and his son (who seemed to walk off into certain death). The only reason that it's done is so that any genuine emotional distress is kept away from the audience. Don't worry everybody, you'll all die but the stars will survive!",Null,1,3,2 August 2005
There Will Be Blood," The corruption of the American dream (spoilers)
","If you had to list America's two main obsessions you'd probably whittle it down to money and religion. Both seem to consume the American soul  the pursuit of monetary gain and the need for spiritual enlightenment. But if there were to be a battle between the two for America's heart, which would win? The battle between Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) could be viewed as America's internal struggle between commerce and religion. Sure in modern America both co-exist, but despite that there's still a conflict. In the darkest corners rampant greed and fundamentalism still want to take hold.Of course Daniel represents the commercial side of America  the one that wants to possess its body, who wants to own everything. Eli on the other hand represents the form of evangelism that wants to possess everyone's minds, who wants people to look upon him as god on Earth. Needless to say, with these two conflicting personalities sharing the same space there's going to be fireworks.A wonderful scene early on in the film is when Eli turns up at Daniel's office and tells him that he's going to bless the well. He doesn't even ask, he merely dictates everything he's going to say and do, most of it incredibly self-important. Daniel sits there and politely agrees, but when it comes to the blessing, he completely ignores Eli and does it himself. It's a monumental slap in the face, but one which is done with a velvet glove  only Daniel and Eli are aware of what was supposed to happen; as far as everyone else in concerned, the ceremony went off without a hitch.But then to illustrate the way that the conflict ebbs and flows, later on Daniel has to come crawling to Eli so that he can say a few words at a funeral  one of his men, who attended Eli's church, dies while working. You can see the sheer contempt Daniel has for Eli as the preacher rants and raves, and when they talk Daniel makes it clear that the church needs him. Without Plainview and his men, the well won't produce and 'blow gold all over the place'. In other words, the church better know what side their bread is buttered on.However, even though at one point Daniel slaps Eli around and drags him through oilfields for being a fraud who can't cure his son's deafness, Eli Sunday still won't be put in his place. He seizes on the opportunity to make Daniel bow before him  Daniel needs to use some land and the owner of the land make it a condition that Daniel be blessed by the church. Eli returns Daniel's violence by slapping him and casting evil spirits out of him. But worse than that he gets Daniel to scream that he abandoned his child. This is the one thing that really annoys him. But it's notable that even though Daniel has had to humiliate himself, once the ordeal is done he can't help but smile. He has the land and he can now finish making a pipeline that will ensure his wealth. He cares more about money than he does his child  it's a grimly comic moment.The final scene between Daniel and Eli sees a kind of role reversal. The money from his church squandered, Eli comes to Daniel begging for help. Daniel agrees to help him, but only if Sunday stands up and declares himself to be a false prophet and that god is a superstition. He makes Eli say it over and over again and louder and louder, until he finally admits that he can't help Eli, that the land Eli wants Daniel to buy has already been drained dry. We then have the infamous milkshake scene and Daniel clubs Eli to death with a bowling pin. It's quite a comic scene, and one that threatens to become ridiculous  Dano overacts, Day-Lewis shouts 'drainage' at the top of his lungs and Plainview dances and waves his straw around  but it ends up being a suitably silly ending to a rather silly conflict. The pull of soulless greed and soulless fundamentalism should strike anyone as childish  both are concerned with an overwhelming simplicity of thought. Therefore it's quite apt that these people should meet their end while chasing each other around a bowling alley.But despite this, if there's a winner in this conflict, it's Daniel. Therefore the film kind of suggests that as far as America goes, commerce will triumph over religion. And it makes sense, as religion is often dependant on the generosity of businessmen. Religion needs commerce more than commerce needs religion.The most telling moment in the film is when the well is on fire. Daniel celebrates because there is an ocean of oil under his feet. But when someone asks whether his son is okay  he gets knocked on his head by the gusher  he casually says he's not. Nothing is going to get in the way of Plainview making a fortune. This is all that he cares about. This is all he's focused on. Everything else is window dressing. His son, his clothes and his plain words present an acceptable image for the outside world; one that masks the soul-destroying greed. And it's an image that America still presents to the outside world. As a country it says that it cares, but like Plainview it ends up taking more than it gives back. Therefore the initially jarring music at the beginning is entirely appropriate. This is almost a horror film. A marvellous ode to avarice and the corruption of the American dream.",Null,2,4,30 May 2008
Man on Fire," Creasy Bear (spoilers)
","I'm not quite sure what went right with Man on Fire. I mean, really, it should be a terrible film. Just take the excess of style (hand-cranked shots, flying subtitles and schizophrenic editing) and the sickeningly cute child. Nine out of ten children in films make me wish that greedy Mexicans would kidnap them  take them away and get them out of my sight. Plus there's a potential for something queasy and unwholesome in the relationship between man and child  I don't really want to watch the Gary Glitter story. But somehow some way the film overcomes all these obstacles and produces something remarkably effective.I guess the main reason the film works is because the relationship between Creasy and Pita works. Like I said before, in the wrong hands it could come across as something unhealthy. Instead it's rather, well, sweet. And a lot of the credit for this has to go to Denzel Washington. He plays everything quite deadpan and his reactions are understated so you never feel that he's a Jesus Quintana type of character. And although some of the scenes are amusingly trite ('Creasy, you're smiling') they work because Washington underplays them. He gives a rather hackneyed script a hell of a lot of class.Credit also has to go to Dakota Fanning. Yeah she's predictably precocious but she's not overbearingly cute and she can hold her own in a scene with the likes of Washington. Plus, rather strangely for a child actor, she's quite endearing. Therefore, for once, you can understand the killing rampage that ensues.And the killing rampage itself is magnificent. Although I'm undecided as to what I like more: the fingers being cut off or the bomb up the bum. I mean, the bomb up the bum has a bomb up the bum, but I like how sadistic the finger torture is (the whole film makes me want to hug my inner-fascist). That being said, though, I do love Washington's performance in the bomb scene ('I wish you had more time'). And the moment with Denzel walking in slow motion with the bomb exploding behind him is the best shot in the film  it's the, er, 'badass' shot.But the rocket launcher/motorcade scene also deserves respect. In fact, after Death Wish 3 and now Man on Fire I've come to the conclusion that you just can't go wrong with rocket launcher violence (especially when it takes place in an elderly couple's house). And the casual Terminator-like shootings that follow after the explosion are great. Rocket launcher + casual shootings = success.Another thing that I get a kick out of in Man on Fire is the religious slant (Creasy reads the Bible). This obviously isn't just any normal act of vengeance; this is a righteous act of retribution; Creasy is an avenging angel (he doesn't even care that he's killing himself). Just take one of the best quotes in the film: 'Forgiveness is between them and god. It's up to me to arrange the meeting.' Very Biblical. Then there's the bullet that doesn't go off when he tries to commit suicide. The film might as well just come out and say it: god saved him. But making it even funnier is the way that he later gives the same bullet to Pita's father. He practically forces the bloke to try and kill himself and then says, 'I'll pray for you.' Of course this time the bullet goes off. I guess it must have been god's will.And also helping with the whole quasi-religious subtext is the fact that the film is played like an opera  you've got Pavarotti playing when he kills the cop and when he pushes the car off the cliff. Everything in the film is heightened, everything button and dial is switched up to maximum. There's no room for subtlety here.But the fact that the film isn't subtle doesn't matter one bit. In fact, if anything, it makes it more enjoyable. I mean, sure, the fractured editing is a little wearing and the visual pyrotechnics bludgeon you somewhat, but I love all the clichés in the film. My favourite is the drink problem. There's nothing quite as much fun as a down and out, lonely man who loves the sauce  and although I perhaps didn't appreciate them in the way they were intended, I loved all the moody shots of Creasy drinking; you just know that only a vengeful killing rampage can get him on the wagon. And I also like the way that a beard (well, and an affinity for booze) is the only thing you need to show that Creasy (at the beginning) is troubled. In the movies a scruffy man equals a tortured man.And do I need to point out the genius of this line: 'Creasy's art is death. He's about to paint his masterpiece.' Just brilliant. And the fact that the delivery is completely serious cracks me up even more. (The whole film is ludicrous but for some reason I'm with it all the way.)I also like all the 'Creasy bear' stuff. One I find it funny and two I actually find it weirdly touching: how could you not be inspired to kill lots of people after reading 'I love you Creasy Bear' over and over again? Hell, I hate children, but reading that would even make me bloodthirsty.And yet another thing I like about the film is the unashamedly emotional ending. It's a right wing, fascist, Biblical, action weepy. It's perfect for people who like to see lots gratuitous violence but who are sentimental saps too. In other words, people like me. I love you too, Creasy Bear. Er, I mean, yeah, good work Denzel.",Null,1,2,7 October 2005
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Far from great but better than its reputation
","Francis Ford Coppola's version of Dracula has one major problem: some abysmal casting. Most obviously you have Keanu Reeves, but there's also Sadie Frost and Cary Elwes to help bring it down.I'm not quite sure what was going on in Coppola's head when he cast Reeves (in later interviews he's admitted he did it to attract young women and that he regrets his decision), but you'd be hard pushed to find a worse performance. I'm sure even nativity plays display greater acting talent. But Reeves really does nearly ruin the whole thing, especially as much of the early part of the film rests upon his shoulders. But how can you take seriously a character who sounds like he comes from London, California (I always expect him to say, 'Woah, Dracula dude')? And how can you loose yourself in a performance that equates jerky head movements as the sole trait of the upper middle classes? It really is rather embarrassing and hard to watch; I even sometimes hide behind my hands, not at the horror in the film but as a man more wood than flesh tries to convey emotion. But having said that, there is one moment where Reeves convinces: the bit where Dracula sacrifices a baby to his three whorish vampires. All Reeves has to do is scream and he actually manages to do it half convincingly. It's just too bad the role required more than that.Nowhere near as bad as Reeves, but still rather annoying is Sadie Frost as Lucy, Mina's friend. And the reason she grates is rather simple: she has an annoying voice. I don't really know how to describe it, but the sound is as uncomfortable to listen to as hearing someone scraping their teeth with a rusty file. And she also has the most terrible head of ginger hair. She looks Spuggie out of Byker Grove. But she's fine in the non-speaking bits. You know, the bits where she's getting nailed by a wolf beast and having her throat ripped out. There she's okay.Then there's Cary Elwes. The man has no genuine acting talent, therefore it's rather hard to try and watch him act tough and be a romantic hero. His worst moment is when Lucy is having a blood transfusion and he flings the doors open, asking what's going on. He's trying to be authoritative but shouting and exaggerated macho striding just makes you look like a knob. And he's just as bad when he gets sentimental over Lucy. He says he'd give every last drop of blood for her. He looks like a puppy dog, albeit a puppy dog you got for Christmas and then want to immediately take down Battersea Dogs Home to be destroyed.And now I think about it, even Winona Ryder isn't that good. There's one bit where she becomes some horny seductress and tries to seduce Hopkins' Van Helsing. She just isn't the least bit convincing. Her seduction technique is about as arousing as putting snails in your pants. And in other moments she looks unconvincing too. However, at other times she's pretty good. It's a very uneven performance.But despite all the bad performances and all the other shortcomings (the film is really all over the place when in terms of narrative), I still find myself rather enjoying it. I guess the main reason why I'm so lenient is because the visuals are so good. I really do love the way the film looks. And I also the way the film opts for a hyper-sexualised romance over a man in a cape. It at least tries to do something different.My favourite image in the film has to be the battle at the start. Everything is shot in silhouette, almost as if it's a puppet theatre. And I love the gruesome way that men get stabbed and the way a soldier that's impaled on a spike slides down it while still alive. Brilliant stuff. And then just after that there's a magnificent shot where Dracula's wife jumps out of the castle and falls down to the moat below. It's an awesome piece of visual film-making. However, even in these moments of brilliance, the great has to co-exist with the crap: when Dracula bends over his dead wife, Ryder visibly blinks. It's something that's easy to miss, but once you notice it it becomes infuriating that Coppola didn't.Other great shots include the emergence of Dracula's coach and the way the horses almost float over the smoke, the shots of Dracula's shadow which has a life of its own, the crazy POV shots of the wolf beast and all the painterly shots of Dracula's castle. It's a film that doesn't give a toss about reality and which is better for it.But I'm also very forgiving of the film because Gary Oldman is so great as Dracula. He manages to be frightening, amusing and romantic all in one film. It's quite something to watch, especially when most of the actors around him fail dismally to convince. But I love the schizophrenic way that he can go from one extreme to the next. As the razor-licking tit-head Dracula (that's got to be the most bonkers hairstyle ever), he's amusing one moment and unsettling the next. Then as the young Dracula he's charming and romantic. But then as the wolf beast and the giant bat, he becomes monstrous. It pummels every other portrayal of Dracula into the ground. And at the end he even manages to elicit some sympathy for his character, which is no mean feat when he's a blood-sucking madman. But as fantastic as he is, he's let down by those around him. If the film had been cast properly it could have been something really special.",Null,0,0,30 December 2005
American Gangster," Modest gangster film (spoilers)
","On the brink of death an aged gangster bemoans the state of America. He sees that corporations are taking over and that the little man is being cut out. 'Where's the pride of ownership?' he wails. Damn soulless, faceless McDonald's are everywhere.This might seem like quite an honourable concern. It sounds like the old man is grieving over the homogenisation of the modern world. But in reality the old man is only upset because it's nearly impossible to shake down large corporations. Shop owners are meant to be vulnerable and powerless. They're meant to pay him a cut of their earnings. But multinationals are far more powerful than the old man will ever be. It's impossible for him to get a piece of the action.When the old man dies, Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) decides to take over his operations. But while the old man had reached the limit of his ingenuity and had become a relic, Frank sees where the business has to go. He has to become like the large corporations. He can't just sell random junk. That would earn him peanuts. Instead he decides to create a brand.The heroin that Frank sells is called Blue Magic. It's purer than anything that's on the streets and it's cheaper too. And Frank can do this because he cuts out the middleman. He's both supplier and distributor. He's taken a leaf out of the corporation's book.Another way that Frank is like the corporations is that he's highly protective of his brand. One drug dealer takes Blue Magic and cuts it up in order to try and make more money. But this reflects badly on the brand. It's no longer Blue Magic. Frank even says that his customers have a guarantee of quality when they buy his product. It's like he's talking about coffee rather than heroin.What's notable is that like a good businessman, Frank does his best to stay as anonymous as possible. Occasionally he has to lay down the law and make a scene to get everyone in line, but otherwise he doesn't want to draw undue attention to himself. He just wants to blend in. However, he does have a moment of weakness. His wife buys him an expensive fur coat and hat. In a second he goes from anonymous-looking businessman to black gangster. And wearing this outlandish outfit to a boxing match, and getting the best seats in the house, he alerts himself to the cops  previously he flew under the radar. Suddenly he has the attention of both Detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) and some bent cops led by Detective Trupo (Josh Brolin). And then on his wedding day, Trupo tries to shake down Frank for money. Frank's indulgence has cost him. It's exposed him and made him vulnerable. Therefore he burns the hat and coat while his bride sobs.All of these details and all of these parallels between gangsters and corporations make American Gangster an interesting film, but it never really takes flight. In fact, visually it's surprisingly bland for a Ridley Scott film. He captures the grime and squalor of 70s Harlem well enough, but with his usual widescreen frame jettisoned, it feels more like television. The film is solid but unspectacular.Of course, that's probably intentional. The film doesn't want to showboat. It wants to be a more gritty, realistic depiction of the drug trade. It doesn't want to have the glamour of The Godfather or Goodfellas. But this is still cinema and there's nothing that's really going to take your breath away.Instead the film's pleasures are smaller. There's a nice scene where the wealthy Lucas family are sitting down to a sumptuous Thanksgiving meal and thanking god for all they have while junkies shoot up  we even see a child crying over a parent who has overdosed. This is the product that Frank pedals: misery. He makes himself fat over other people's weakness and stupidity.But although this criticism is well made, you do occasionally feel that the film makes the mistake of liking Frank Lucas a little too much. Even though Scorsese's gangster films are more cinematic and therefore more seductive, Scorsese always stays objective  he knows these people are scum; therefore he just turns on the camera and lets them hang themselves. Scott, though, seems a little seduced. At the end, as Lucas cooperates with Richie, we see him laughing and smiling. Is the film trying to show us that deep down he's a decent guy? And there's also a heavy focus on police corruption in the film. Don't get me wrong. Corrupt police are just as bad as criminals such as Lucas. But you kind of get the feeling that the film is saying they're worse. Fact is, they're the same. The film shows that they all feed off one another. But although we get that one moment where we see junkies shooting up during Thanksgiving, the film soft pedals the misery Frank brought to the streets. He was a scumbag and instead he's made to look like a ruthless businessman who really had a decent heart underneath it all.Another weakness is the familiarity of Richie's story  the cop who catches Lucas. His character has all the familiar beats  a failed marriage, a desire to be the one straight cop in the bad town, and the struggle to crack the ring. None of his scenes are bad, but you're constantly reminded of better movies such as The French Connection. And that's the problem with the whole film. As you watch it you're constantly reminded of better movies. The Godfather, Goodfellas and The French Connection all pop in your head and you realise that American Gangster can't hold a candle to any of them.",Null,1,2,18 July 2008
The Mission," Underrated (spoilers)
","The Mission starts with quite a startling image. It starts with a group of Indians tying a priest to a crucifix and then sending him off down river. For a while he floats helplessly in the rapids but then he falls off the side of a huge waterfall. By the end of the movie you can't help but feel that the Indians would have been better off if they'd done this to every priest that crossed their path.There's something quite loathsome about a group of foreigners barging into someone else's country and telling that they're wrong and that they should worship a non-existent sky god. It's arrogant (every religion and every country thinks it has the definitive answer) and it erodes cultures. But although I personally find the very nature of mission work distasteful, it's to The Mission's credit that it presents characters we can understand and sympathise with, for these people seem less interested in preaching religious dogma than encouraging the native people to flourish.The majority of the film focuses on Father Gabriel, played by Jeremy Irons. He's the kind of priest that doesn't have all the answers and who isn't on a mad quest to save the soul's of the savage, barbaric Indians. In other words, he's a man you come to like.The Indians come to like him too. Pretty soon he's gained their trust and they've welcomed him into their community. And he gains their trust in the simplest possible way  through music. There's one beautiful scene where he sits in the middle of the jungle playing the oboe. In the mist he kind of looks like a ghost. And it's not long before the curious Indians emerge. They don't quite know what to make of it. But what the scene suggests is that what unites us a species is a love of music and a desire to feel in harmony with the world. That's what all people share. Religion, on the other hand, seems to me to be nothing but divisive.But although in the grand scheme of things religion has been nothing but a pestilence, the film also shows that on the small scale it can work. It certainly works for Robert De Niro's character, Mendoza. At the beginning he's a slaver who profits from trading the Indians. He also kills his brother in a fit of rage when he catches him with his woman. But after the murder he can't handle his guilt. Therefore he decides to pay penance by dragging a heavy bundle around with him. In this state he crosses rivers and climbs cliffs (some of the stunt work here is absolutely hair-raising, especially for someone, like me, who hates heights) but he only stops when one of the Indians, one of the people he used to hunt, cuts the bundle from around his neck and throws it into the river. It's only then, when one of the Indians forgives him for what he's done to them that he can forgive himself for what he's done in the past. It's an excellent scene, possibly the best in the film.After this Mendoza becomes a Jesuit priest and joins Gabriel's order. And this leads to a nice series of scenes where Mendoza is welcomed into the community. The warmth that they offer him is the complete opposite of the coldness of the settlers.And it's the settlers who are the villains of the piece. They're the kind of people who invade foreign lands and enslave other human beings while sincerely classing the indigenous population as savages. They're hypocrites and they're morally bankrupt.But the Catholic Church doesn't come off much better. The crux of the story centres on a dispute over territory and whether the Church is going to protect the missions. Of course the Church turns out to be spineless and it tells the Indians to give up their homes, their mission and everything they've built to the settlers. But quite understandably, the Indians don't understand. They don't understand why god is treating them this way. I'm sure they're not the first to wonder why god is such a sadist.But although the Church in the film comes across as worthless, the priests do come across as heroic. Even though it goes against everything they believe in, the majority of them decide to fight in order to protect what they've built. And in the end all of them die for it  the moment where a dying Mendoza sees Father Gabriel shot dead is one of the most powerful in the film. But although it's a noble act, it also makes you wonder what good religion has done for any of these people. Without it there certainly wouldn't have been such carnage.Misgivings about religion aside, though, the film's rather wonderful. It's definitely one of the most beautiful films I've seen. The photography is gorgeous and Ennio Morricone's score is one of his best (which is saying something). In fact, the main title music may possibly be my favourite piece of film music. And I also love the oboe piece.The acting too is excellent, especially Jeremy Iron's performance  it takes a lot of skill to make decency as interesting as villainy. But I do have to say that Robert De Niro feels a little out of place. Maybe he's played too many psychotics or maybe it's something wrong with me, but he's not entirely convincing in this film. But that's not to say he's bad. He just doesn't really seem to fit the character.And I also have to say that the film drags a little in the final act  the final confrontation isn't as visceral as it should have been. But on the whole The Mission is a fine film. Indeed, any film that has me rooting for priests must be doing something right.",Null,6,8,17 November 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The worst Star Wars film (spoilers throughout)
","Who ever thought that Darth Vader, the baddest guy in the galaxy, would turn out to be such a wet blanket? Not me. Well, not until the new Star Wars trilogy began. But even then, and after having to endure sickeningly cute Vader ('Wizard!') and petulant adolescent Vader ('They're like animals, and I slaughtered them like animals. I HATE THEM') I still had hope for the final part of the trilogy. Surely that would be good, I thought. Only a moron could screw that up. And after all the good reviews, I thought that finally, at long last, Lucas had delivered another fine Star Wars film. Cue disgust then when Lucas not only produced a terrible Star Wars film but the worst one of all.There are many low points in the film but the worst has to be the Vader transformation. It's the bit that everyone has been waiting to see. It's the bit that is supposed to make the trilogy worthwhile. So imagine my disgust when Vader lumbers from the operating table like a constipated Frankenstein and when he cries 'Nooooooooooooo!' in Seymour Skinner style when he hears that his wife has died. Pathetic. Now, when I watch the original trilogy, I'm only going to see a melodramatic drama queen under that tin can helmet.But I still don't even know why Anakin turned to the dark side. The plot just didn't make any sense. Anakin had some bad dreams, got worried about his wife and then turned to the dark side to protect them? Eh? What? It's absolute rubbish. And it's amazing how stupid Anakin is. Palpatine tells him a story about a 'person he knew' and how this 'person' had known a powerful Sith Lord. This 'person' then learnt many things from this Sith Lord, including how to extend life. However, this 'person' then killed this Sith Lord in his sleep. Hmm. I wonder who this person was? Gosh, it's a puzzle... But because of one or two bad dreams Anakin decides to trust this slimy scumbag on the off chance that his dream will come true. Of course, the dream only comes true when Anakin attacks his wife. Ooh, so it was a self-fulfilling prophecy? Oh, aren't you clever, George? Let me bow down before your writing genius.Er, or maybe not.But I just hate the idea of Vader being so stupid. What it amounts to is that he was tricked into becoming a bad guy. He had a few worries, some bloke came along and used them to his advantage, and there you go, he's evil. It's terrible. When the trilogy started I was looking forward to a nuanced story. I wanted it to be haunting, to be tragic and to be dark as hell. I wanted Vader to be truly troubled. What I didn't want was a pouting idiot with an inferiority complex. Unfortunately, that's what I got.However, the other bad guys are useless too. Especially the much hyped General Grievous. With a name like that you'd imagine a hard-as-nails villain. Instead you get a spluttering moron whose party-trick is to take four lightsabers and twirl them and attack windmill style. It's the equivalent of me getting into fight, twirling my arms, and running forward at full speed. Needless to say General Grievous cops it to a man with three less lightsabers.In fact, that villain, and everything else in the film, makes me wonder what the motivation was for these characters. I can just picture some animator or Lucas saying, 'Wouldn't it be cool if...' or 'Wouldn't it be neat if...' But of course, it's not neat and it's not cool. Just because you can do something doesn't mean that you should. I'm actually really pleased that Lucas made the original films when he did. It meant that he couldn't indulge every whim and that he had to focus on trivial matters such as story. After all, the originals have cracking stories. They may not be high art, and they may have hokey bits of dialogue, but at least they make sense. The new films on the other hand make no sense whatsoever. The plots are needlessly complicated, and not complicated in a good way. After all, I think that I'm a pretty smart guy. I can make my way through a dense story. But this story is only dense in the sense that it's incredibly stupid. All the talking seems to be an excuse to move to another bland piece of action. It doesn't matter that the plot is impenetrably fuzzy.But what about the action? Is it 'kewl'? Does it 'kick ass'? No, it doesn't. It's like watching someone play a computer game. It's tiresome and uninvolving. The only difference is that the graphics are better. Ah, but what about the final battle I hear you say. Surely that must be good. Well, it's okay, I guess. Although having said that, for the most part it's pretty forgettable. The best lightsaber battle is the one in Return of the Jedi when Luke fights Vader. It has passion and bags of emotion. This, however, is full of pointless gimmicks - they climb onto a tower and it falls and over and they float across the lava on little robots while trying to strike one another. I love the lava backdrop but they should have kept it simple. It needs intensity not stupid 'bits of business'. But having said that, the battle does contain the one thing that I liked in the film. I loved it when Anakin got his legs chopped off and when he caught fire. Now that was 'kewl'! Pity that Lucas had to mess up that piece of brutality with his embarrassing 'Noooooooo!'",Null,3,6,11 June 2005
Casino Royale," A Bond to be reckoned with (spoilers)
","It's strange, but despite being an excellent 007, Pierce Brosnan only made one truly great Bond film  that being Goldeneye. The others were either mediocre (Tomorrow Never Dies, The World is Not Enough) or downright dreadful (Die Another Day). Therefore the Bond producers had a mammoth task on their hands in order to rescue Bond, to move it away from the jokey, CGI-ridden mess of the last adventure and back to what made the franchise so enjoyable in the first place  cool action, sexy women and a ruthless hero.Loud, obnoxious objections were made when Daniel Craig was cast as Bond (oh my god, he's blonde!), but he's long since proved his detractors wrong. His Bond is quiet, determined and ruthless. He's the complete opposite of Roger Moore, who you felt was more happy firing one liners and bedding bimbos than busting heads and blowing people away. Therefore Craig's Bond has more in common with Connery and Dalton, which can only be a good thing.However, Casino Royale must be the first Bond film where 007 himself is the main piece of crumpet. Time after time we're confronted with Craig's bulging muscles. It's enough to remind you of 80s action films, where the men, much more so than the women, were the main object of longing. Indeed, in the marvellous torture scene, Le Chiffre even compliments Bond on his physique as he prepares to punish his privates. His dialogue is delivered with such admiration that I couldn't help but wonder if Le Chiffre was going to oil his pecs rather than beat him up.But homoerotic or not, the scene, for once, shows Bond in real peril. And for once Bond actually gets the snot beaten out of him and doesn't escape the villain's clutches via some convenient gadget. But having said this, Bond does show remarkable fortitude for someone who's having his testicles smashed. He taunts the villain and laughs in his face. Ordinarily, this in itself would be laughable, but seeing as it's 007 you can't help but get a kick out of it. That's our boy  his gonads may be wrecked but he's still the man.As well as being a tough Bond film, quite a bit has been written about 007 showing his softer side. For the most part, the scenes with Eva Green work well. The scene in the shower, for instance, where Bond comforts Vesper and sucks her fingers is very sexy. But some of the later scenes, where the two decide to run off to Venice, feel a little pap. They're never risible  mainly because Green and Craig have a lot of chemistry together  but they could have been improved. And their first encounter on the train is also a little lacklustre. Part of this is because Green, for all her style and charisma, never looks as if she's 100% comfortable in the part (sometimes she seems to be trying too hard), but it's also due to the writing. I mean, all the amateur psychoanalysis is incredibly heavy-handed and the stuff about Bond's watch is just plain awful. 'Rolex?' 'Omega.' 'Beautiful.' Ker-ching!But aside from these minor complaints, the film works wonderfully. It's truly up there with On Her Majesty's Secret Service, From Russia With Love, Goldeneye and Licence to Kill as one of the best Bond films. In particular what I like is just how ruthless Bond is in this film. As much as I get a kick out of dear old Rog delivering one liners and judo chops, I prefer Bond to be a cold-blooded murderer. I want him to seem like a physical threat. I don't want him just to be a ladies man. Therefore I love seeing Craig strangle, drown and stab bad guys. And I like seeing him shoot people without batting an eyelid. In too many films these days we have the tortured hero; it's nice to just have someone who's unapologetically mean.One of my favourite little Bond moments in this film is when he defeats a bad guy at poker and wins the man's Aston Martin. The casual way that Bond asks for the valet ticket is a joy to behold. As is the moment when a couple of fat German tourists mistake Bond for a hotel employee. Again, I love the casual way that he smashes their Range Rover and tosses their car keys. This is the Bond we've been waiting a long time to see; a Bond of action rather than groansome quips.Not that there aren't some good lines in the film. There's a nice little bit of humour after Bond nearly has a heart attack. 'I'm sorry. That last hand. Nearly killed me.' And I love Bond's reaction to how he wants his Martini, shaken or stirred. 'Do I look like I give a damn?' You finally get the feeling that the series is shaking off the ghost of the past. It finally seems to be heading in a new direction.Whether this new attitude is maintained, though, remains to be seen. After all, Goldeneye gave me false hope that the franchise was going to be reinvigorated and it quickly fell back into its old ways. But regardless of whether that happens, what we have here is a great Bond film. Or should I say, a great pre-Bond film, as it's only in the final scene that we finally see the true 007  this movie is all about how he became. And the final moment, where Bond finally becomes Bond, is maybe the highlight of the movie. Let's hope it's not downhill from here.",Null,3,10,5 July 2007
The Deer Hunter," A great film (spoilers)
","Anyone who says the opening to The Deer Hunter is too long or that it's boring is, quite frankly, an idiot. The opening, aside from being an amazing piece of cinema, is what makes us care so deeply about the characters. If it were shorter it would lessen the impact of the final scenes.The most important part of the beginning is to get a flavour of where these characters live, their home, because that's what the film is really about. It's not really about the Vietnam War. It's about what happens when your home is taken away from you  the characters could be involved in any conflict.And the opening scenes work tremendously well in painting a portrait of how and where these characters live. They're ordinary, blue-collar guys, and like most of those guys they get drunk and make fun out of each other. They're also cocky and are reluctant to express their emotions. However, in one little moment, Nicky (Christopher Walken) tells Mike (Robert De Niro) how much he likes the trees in the mountains when they go hunting. He can't express himself properly, either because he doesn't want to lay himself bare or because he's incapable of doing so, but you know that behind all the crap he loves the place where he lives and he loves the people around him.But of course, Nicky expresses these sentiments more directly later on in a scene after the wedding. He tells Mike that he loves his hometown and that he doesn't want to be left in Vietnam  if something goes wrong, he wants Mike to bring him back. Of course, these words are spoken in a drunken haze, but that's the only way these characters can relate  as is the case with a lot of men, it is only alcohol that lowers the defences.And there's a beautiful scene after the wedding where all the guys retreat to a bar. They joke around and they drink, and then one of the characters begins playing the piano. Slowly you see each person in turn and you feel like they finally understand what might be about to happen. Before this they're full of heroic delusions and toasts are made to the guys who are going to be fighting, but with the music the enormity of the situation seems to slowly dawn upon them. They don't have the vocabulary to accurately voice their fears, but the music seems to do it for them.Another criticism that's levelled at The Deer Hunter is that there's no evidence that prisoners of war were made to play Russian Roulette. Quite frankly, who cares? Whether you want to argue that the games are a metaphor for the randomness of war or whether they're a microcosm of the Vietnam conflict, all that matters is that in a dramatic context, they work. And they work like gangbusters. Few scenes make me as angry or get me as worked up as those that happen in this film. With every game and with every person that's killed, Cimino winds you up tighter. You've seen these guys get drunk, you've laughed at their jokes and now you're watching them get killed.But although some people moan that the Russian Roulette is exploitative or that it goes for cheap emotion, I think it's a more dramatic way of showing the horrors of conflict. And at least it's something different  at least Cimino doesn't go for the standard war film clichés. And I guess you could argue that the scenes show the way that people and countries shoot themselves in the head by indulging in such pointless conflicts.One of the scenes, though, that gets to me the most occurs in a Veteran's hospital. Nicky, having survived the ordeal, looks down upon all the body bags and then has to suffer lots of pointless questions made by some bureaucrat. They're simple questions, like 'what's your name?' and 'where do you come from?', but after a while Nicky can no longer answer them. He's reduced to tears. In light of all he's been through the questions seem so pointless  his home has been taken away from him; after all he's been through he can't go back.But although Nicky can't go home, Mike does make the return trip. And of course, for him, everything has changed. And he can't even face seeing his friends  they try and hold a welcome back party for him. But instead he drives by and heads for a cheap hotel. And here we have a wonderful little scene with Mike stuck in a lousy room. He's constantly fidgeting, unable to get any rest, and from his wallet he takes a picture of Linda (Meryl Streep), the girl that both he and Nicky are in love with. You feel by looking at this picture Mike is trying to reclaim his home. He's trying to get his old life back. But of course, it's pointless. Those people he loves and who stayed at home don't truly understand what he went through and those he fought and suffered with have been changed by the war  they're no longer the same friends that he danced and got drunk with.But it's to Mike's credit that despite everything he stays true to his promise. He tries to bring everyone home; he tries to put all the pieces back together. But as Steven says (now stuck in a wheelchair), he doesn't fit anymore. And so therefore Mike's mission to bring Nicky back is pointless  the man is too far gone. But at the same time, it's essential. It's essential for Mike and the rest of the community to have a definitive resolution. They need to be able to move on. And although Nicky may have lost sight of home, you feel like slowly Mike and Steve will reclaim what was once theirs.",Null,0,1,27 August 2007
Beowulf," Shrek with sex and violence (spoilers)
","I'm not quite sure what's up with Robert Zemeckis' animation fetish. First The Polar Express and now Beowulf (and in the future, A Christmas Carol). He seems to have got tired with any notion of reality, of the limitations that traditional film-making techniques put on him. After all, Beowulf could have been a live-action picture. With technology today, it wouldn't have been that difficult. But instead Zemeckis decided against pursuing that route.This decision has both benefits and drawbacks. Yes the characters often move in a weird, jerky way and yes it's strange seeing animated versions of famous actors, but at the same time the fidelity to this technique gives you a certain purity of vision  there's no awkward mixture of effects and reality; you either buy into this visualisation of the story or you don't. And to be honest, the technique never took me out of the film.Well, okay, there was one thing that took me out of the film. The hero is played by Ray Winstone. Okay, that shouldn't affect me in any way  he's a good actor. But the character here is ripped, whereas Ray is, well, fat. Everyone else looks like the actor who plays them, while Beowulf looks like Sean Bean. Weird.But of course part of the point of filming the movie this way is to do things that you couldn't do in a normal film  impossible camera shots, have fantastical beasts interact more easily with humans and have the characters age more convincingly. And there are some beautiful moments. There's one bit near the start where the King's hall is celebrating and dancing and you slowly move out of the building and across the snowy fields. But then the camera keeps moving. It keeps moving through forests and mountains until it comes to a cave. We then see the monster Grendel scream in pain. It's a flashy shot but it's also a great way of explaining the character  the enjoyment of others, the pleasure this monster can never have, is what causes him pain.And the monster is a pretty horrific creation. His screams are ear-splittingly loud and he cries like a child. But he also appears in the King's hall and rips men to pieces  one even gets tossed in the air and lands on a spear. But worse than this, in a later scene, where Beowulf confronts the monster, he eats a soldier. For a while he stands there munching on the guy, a sad look on his face. Quite how this film got released as a 12A/PG-13, I don't know.But the confrontation between Beowulf and Grendel is probably the best scene in the film. It's horrific, exciting and the monster's ultimate destruction (by Beowulf ripping its arm off) is also quite sad. As well as being fearsome, Grendel is also incredibly pathetic. He's a sad little child who is under the thumb of his demonic mother. And as Beowulf shouts at him while having him trapped, he can only whimper.However, as well as all this, the scene is also amusing. Why, you ask? Well, for some reason, Beowulf decides he has to fight the monster naked. The explanation is something silly, like because the monster has no weapon he's going to fight it without weapons as well. But when he disrobes, women squeal in excitement. And to hide his dangly bits from the children who will doubtlessly be seeing this film, objects are always obscuring his genitals. The best example of this is when he stands on a table and approaches a sword that is implanted in the wood. Yes, he has a large sword. Yes, he's one hell of a man.But there's actually plenty of sex in the film. Not only do you have a gnarly buff warrior disrobing so that he can go toe-to-toe with a monster, but you have the soldiers flirting with a maid with large knockers and Grendel's mother who has golden breasts. Fighting and shagging are the film's forte. And it's weird that Angelina, without the tats and with some shape brought back to her increasingly emaciated face, looks better here than she does in reality. No wonder so many Kings have been brought to their doom  who wouldn't want to nail a demon with golden breasts and feet that are in the shape of high heels?However, there's a high price to pay for nailing Grendel's mum. Her womb seems to be a bit messed up. One King gets a crying, ten-foot tall troll as a son and Beowulf gets a dragon. Yeah, that's a high price to pay for some sweet, sweet demon poontang.The final action scene, where Beowulf fights the dragon, isn't as enjoyable as the scrap with Grendel, but it continues the theme of extreme violence. Not only does Beowulf hack off part of his own arm but he also reaches into the dragon's chest and rips its heart out. And we see this in close-up. Nice.But although the violence is fun, I was more impressed with the atmosphere and the tension the film creates. Sure there are one too many cheap-shots ('we're going to show this film in 3-D, so let's just have things fly at the screen ad nausea; it'll be great!') and the sound is pumped up to 11, but the film is genuinely creepy in places, which pleased me a great deal. And I also like the theme that runs through the film of the importance of stories - how we need them to build heroes, heroes who make our normal lives more bearable. But with this you also have the poison of lies. Once we let them creep into our lives we'll always been enslaved to them. And with this in mind, I have to say that I enjoyed the open ending. Apparently the weakness of men is everlasting; poontang will ruin us all.",Null,2,4,11 February 2008
Speed," The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down (spoilers throughout)
","Speed is another one of those films where the idea is better than the execution. A bus that can't go below 50mph without blowing up? Cool! Just imagine the mayhem that will ensue. But unfortunately this excitement overlooks the fact that only the dregs of society ride the bus.The main aim of a film like this, besides creating exciting action, must be to create likable characters; people we don't want to see blown to smithereens. But really, would you feel any worse if any of the passengers in Speed died? I wouldn't. In fact, I actually like the scene where one of them gets blown up  a jittery old lady gets itchy feet and then eats highway sandwich as the dastardly Dennis Hopper sends her on a one-way trip to Splatsville. But unfortunately this is just a one off. All the rest survivedamn it.But the killing of the nervous old lady is rendered even more amusing than it already is through the attempts to inject emotion. Reeves and Bullock desperately try and make us give a damn. But with the screen filled with such a dearth of acting talent, one can only grin. And besides, Hopper's reaction is much more in line with my own. 'Interactive TV, Jack. Wave of the future.' I'm on his side.However, the old lady is far from the film's most annoying character. That dubious honour would go to Ortiz. He's obviously meant to be the lovable, salt of the Earth type, a working class hero adrift in a sea of cowardly women and retarded men (stand up Alan Ruck). But Carlos Carrasco's line delivery is even worse than Reeves'. Example: when he hears that the bus has to make a 50-foot jump, he's meant to communicate surprise. But rather than adopt a look of disbelief or mutter some expletives, he opens his eyes as wide as they can possibly go (so wide they look like they're about to pop out Loony Tunes-style) and mutters an exaggerated, 'Geez'. It's quite possibly the worst line delivery in cinema.And then you have Bullock. She's a poor enough actress, but she plays the sort of person who tells people to stand behind the yellow linewhen she's not a real bus driverand when there's a bomb on board. I wouldn't have been surprised if she'd asked to see everyone's tickets. But although I could defend her hard-line bus protocol stance (even in crisis situations, people need rules; otherwise chaos ensues), I can't defend her reaction to running a pram over. She takes her hands off the wheel and starts screaming. Bloody women. You're there driving a bus that needs to maintain an acceptable velocity and you endanger everyone's lives because a fat, little baby might have got squashed. Sorry, you're just going to have to pull your knickers up and live with it.And of course, Keanu brings things down even further. Every time he opens his mouth you're waiting for the next mangled line delivery. And sure enough he chokes on his lines with great regularity. Plus it's almost impossible to buy him as a cop. It's not because he comes across as mentally defective  there are plenty of dumb cops  it's more that at any moment I expect him to suddenly run off and go surfing.But actually, thinking about it, Reeves' worst acting is non-verbal. In the opening scenes with the lift, he has to spend a lot of time communicating thought. But the only way he knows how to do it is to chew gum and make lots of jerky bird-like head movements. That's Acting! But one of the things I like about the film  and to be fair, I enjoy the film quite a bit, in the way that one enjoys dumb movies  is the way that Hopper's character is always mocking Reeves' intelligence. He's forever telling him he's dumb ('Do not attempt to grow a brain,' he says at one point). But in Reeves' defence, even Hopper could be labelled stupid. I mean, why does he only install a camera in the bus and not a microphone, too? Of course, the explanation is banal  if he could hear what was going on, it would be impossible for Reeve's to fool him and get everyone off the vehicle, and therefore you wouldn't have a movie  but still, Reeves probably wasn't the only one who rode to school on the short bus.But Hopper, more than the bomb on the bus, is what makes the film. He's just fun to watch. Sure he doesn't stretch himself and sure he repeats past performances (Blue Velvet and Apocalypse Now being the main two), but at least he grasps the absurdity of the film and doesn't take it too seriously. For example, on the train at the end, when his money gets marked, he shouts, 'I'm going to get you, Jack' and then runs off screaming 'Aaaaaaahhhh!' It's stupid and devoid of wit, but it never fails to bring a smile to my face. And I also love the bit when Hopper is watching television and he repeats the newscaster's line: 'The whim of a madman!' Very amusing.Almost as funny is a bit near the end. And it's actually, to my surprise, a Reeves moment (and the laugh is actually intentional). I'm talking about his one liner after Hopper gets decapitated. 'Where's Payne?' 'He lost his head.' Aside from Reeves and Jeff Daniels sitting side by side in an orgasmic stupor after the elevator drop at the beginning, it's one of the few forays into 80s action (which I applaud it for). But unfortunately, after this, you have a horribly mushy ending. And then to accompany the cold water that's been poured in your pants you have to listen to Billy Idol sing all the words he could think of that rhyme with 'speed'. The horror. The horror.",Null,0,1,8 July 2006
Munich," Unbelievable that this lost to 'Crash' (spoilers throughout)
","The final frame of Munich  the image of the Twin Towers  rather than being pat or overly simplistic, as some people would suggest, is a wonderfully economic way of summarising the film's message  for every action there's a reaction; none of us are as innocent as we'd like to think and all of us are responsible for the unholy mess we're in.Munich's main strength is its refusal to glorify or condemn the actions of its protagonists. Nothing they do is heroic, but at the same time, their brutal response to the central atrocity is understandable  if your people are murdered, it's only natural to want to kill the people responsible. The only problem is that revenge begets more revenge, and eventually it's impossible to tell who's good and who's bad.Of course, it's a bit of a cliché these days to have the tortured assassin  the man who's haunted by his actions  but in Munich it never feels like it's done purely for effect. Instead it's a natural by-product of (fairly) ordinary men doing things that most people in 'civilised' society never do  take the lives of other people. And so, therefore, unlike quite a lot of the film-going public, I think the final sex scene between Avner and his wife works tremendously well. It shows how everything has been ruined for him. He's not even capable of enjoying the physical act of love. And remember, this is what he was supposed to be protecting  the men, women and children of his homeland, and their way of life; he was supposed to be making their lives safer. Instead he's just helped things get worse.And Avner's demand for evidence in the final scene is directly related to where we are at the present. All too often our desire for wrongs to be righted is exploited by governments and regimes. Just take Iraq  we've committed massive wrongs to try and right a barbaric act. And then you have the Israeli's justifying their actions in the name of the Holocaust and other more recent acts of brutalism they've suffered. Same goes for the Palestinians  they try and justify bombs and mayhem by saying that the other guys have killed their people. What they say is true, but no one can claim to be righteous  we're all as bad as each other.The film realises this and, even though the protagonists are Israeli, it does a pretty good job of presenting both sides of the argument. Just take the scene in the safe house in Athens. Beneath all the political mumbo jumbo what both sides want is a home. Both want somewhere they can call their own. But by using violence to claim this home both are corrupting their dream  if, by some miracle, one side wins, what's going to be left? And the idea of home is probably the film's main theme  the lengths we go to in order to protect it. It's certainly the reason why these men embark on this mission. But when Avner's mother tells him that he did what he did for their people, and that finally they have a place on Earth, you can only wonder whether it was worth it.For me, one of the best scenes in the film is the bombing at the hotel. Without being heavy handed, it shows how difficult it is to kill somebody. And I don't mean difficult in the same way as the first killing, which is more about the physical difficulty, but instead the moral dilemma. How can you kill somebody in cold blood when you've had a perfectly pleasant conversation with them? And you can see Avner debating it in his mind as he stares at the light. For the first time doubt is creeping into his mind. He's realising that everything isn't clear cut. But still he condemns the man to death  for whatever reason, even when alarm bells are ringing in our head, we're still more than willing to close our eyes and ignore good sense.But even though there's a lot of meat to sink your teeth into, Munich also works as a thriller. The first murder, for instance, is very Hitchcockian. You've got the music, the shadowy figures, the shots of the lift, the terrified killers and the macabre detail of the man falling on the milk bottle. It's very cinematic. And then you have the Munich siege itself. The killings are grim and bloody (and the stabbing in the head is shocking in the way that it comes out of nowhere) but it also gets the blood pumping. It helps you understand the outrage the Israeli's must have felt and how easy it is to let emotions get the better of you.Another excellent scene is the killing of the female assassin. Again the film shows murder as messy and clumsy  the blood squirting out of the woman's throat is a great detail. And then you have the telephone bombing. It's quite conventional in the way it frames it with the little girl  will or won't she get killed?  but Spielberg builds the tension expertly and you're never entirely sure what's going to happen.But to view the film entirely as a thriller would be to miss the point. The film, quite rightly, is more concerned with the way violence corrupts. It's certainly at the root of all our problems today. But as the film points out, for every person that's killed there's another person willing to step into their shoes  the group even has to kill the replacement of a person they assassinate. So what does the group really achieve? The answer is that they achieve nothing. Some people die and things carry on as they did before. They've only fanned the flames.",Null,4,6,16 December 2006
Casino," A stand-alone classic (spoilers)
","Casino is often regarded as a second-rate Goodfellas. It's seen as a bloated sequel to Scorsese's gangster masterpiece. But personally, I think it's just as good as its predecessor. It's an amazing film.However, I can kind of see where people are coming from when they criticise it. Yes, it's excessively violent. Yes, it's bloated. Yes, Pesci plays a character similar to the one he played in Goodfellas. And looking at individual scenes you can make comparisons between the two films: Sam (De Niro) falling for Ginger (Stone) is remarkably similar to the scene where Henry Hill falls in love with Karen after she screams at him at the cab stand, Nicky (Pesci) beating a man with a pen can be linked back to Tommy beating Billy Batts, and the final half an hour where Sam is battling with his wife is filmed in the same frenzy as the day of Henry Hill's arrest. But rather than hurt the film, the familiarity works in its favour. After all, the films both deal with the same world. Therefore, if you've seen Goodfellas, you can plug straight into Casino. But while Goodfellas was about the street level Mafioso, Casino goes one step higher. It's about a more powerful branch of the Mafia. And because the film is dealing with Las Vegas, a city that is loud, brash and devoted entirely to money, it's appropriate that the film is bloated and over the top. Vegas is no place for restraint.The film starts with Sam being blown up. Then the titles kick in and Sam spirals through a neon hell. But rather than see Las Vegas as an ugly, unnatural city, the city is described as paradise on Earth. And really for someone that loves money, someone that is devoted entirely to the accumulation of wealth, it is indeed paradise. And there's a fantastic shot at the beginning where you see Vegas at night through the clouds. As far as Sam's concerned he's looking down on an Earthly heaven. In this place anything is possible. And continuing the operatic theme of the film, the gangsters in Chicago, the guys who have entrusted Sam with the Tangiers casino, are described as gods  and with the way the sequence is filmed they could be looking down from Mount Olympus.But although the film starts as a dream it eventually becomes a nightmare. And of course, money, sex and drugs are the corrupting influences. But as grim and violent as the film is, it's also very funny. I mean, Pesci as Nicky, whether intended or not, is a laugh riot. I could just listen to the helium-powered Lilliputian actor rant and rave all day. One of my favourite scenes has to be when he confronts Sam in the desert. It's beautifully built up as a dangerous showdown  Sam looks for holes in the desert and then Nicky drives through the dust (there's a wonderful shot of Nicky's dust trail reflected in Sam's sunglasses)  but once Pesci begins mouthing off, I can only smile. 'You Jew mother******, you!' Another great Pesci scene is when he puts someone's head in a vice. Again the content is less than savoury, and Pesci is entirely convincing as a psychopath ('Don't make me be a bad guy,' he says with a wonderful sense of the absurd), but Pesci's screaming fills me with joy. 'Charlie M? You made me pop your f****** eye out of your head to protect that piece of s***? Charlie M? You dumb mother******!' And then there's the scene where Nicky is talking to some showgirl. He's talking about food (pounding pink veal, no less) and then once he's led her into his car, he applies pressure to back of the woman's cranium and lies back in the time-honoured way that men do when they receive blow-jobs in movies (there's a similar moment later with Pesci and Stone, which also has me laughing, such is the way the scene begins with the characters bitching about Sam and then descends into rampant horniness). But Pesci has even more great moments: the bit where he insults the dealer, the way he intimidates a banker, the stabbing with a pen and the line 'Peek-a-boo, you f***s, you'. Oh, and there's also the bit where he murders one of the casino's business partners. What I love about the scene is the way that Pesci laughs as he narrates the killing 'the boys decided to settle out of court.' It really shouldn't be funny, it shouldn't amuse you to see someone treat life so casually, but that's one of the strengths of the film: the way it refuses to take a moral stance; Pesci's character gets a kick out of the killing, so that's the way it's portrayed.But of course, a scene that isn't funny is Nicky's killing. Although having said that, I do get a chuckle out of the way that Nicky's narration is interrupted when Frank Vincent hits him. But the beating is incredibly brutal and actually does something rather extraordinary and makes you feel a small measure of sympathy for Pesci's character, especially when he's imploring his friends to stop beating his brother.And it's also quite extraordinary that the film makes you feel a little something for Ginger (Stone is excellent). After all, by the end she's a completely repugnant character  she even does coke in front of her daughter. But rather than being just a bad person, she's portrayed as someone who has been messed up by Las Vegas and her relationships. Therefore, although it's easy to hate her actions, it's harder to hate her as a person.And it's the relationship between Sam and Ginger that gives the film its heart. Sure Pesci's antics are the most entertaining, but buried beneath the violence and the squeaky cursing, you have a perverse love story, and a very affecting one at that.",Null,1,2,21 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Back when Star Wars was cool (spoilers)
","Contrary to popular opinion, Star Wars isn't the greatest film ever made. But neither is it, as some people would lead you to believe, the anti-Christ. Instead it's a very enjoyable film that has been blown out of all proportion by geeks and fanboys  yeah, walking carpets and lightsaber-wielding old men are fun, but they're not the height of cinema.One of the reasons why the original films work and the new ones don't is that Lucas was restricted by money and technology. Here he isn't able to hide his deficiencies behind a barrage of CGI, meaning that he has to craft an interesting story. Of course this means his 'vision' is constrained, but when your ideal vision contains ten ton of needless effects, it's providential that the film came out before the advent of digital technology.It's also worth noting that for all of Lucas' sighing and moaning about the state of film effects in the 70s that the original film still looks pretty great even now. There's something more tangible and believable about effective model work  you feel like you can reach out and touch the Star Destroyer at the beginning. And although you occasionally get the odd dodgy shot where you can see Death Star landscapes that are blatantly model kits stuck together, it's no more blatant than the horribly phoney CGI storm-troopers in the prequels  both take you out of the film for a moment; only in the case of the prequels the out of place effects work is far more frequent.Something else that's worth noting is the newly installed Jabba scene. For all the money that must have been spent on it, the CGI Jabba looks far less convincing than the puppet. And the scene, besides needlessly setting up the later films  it's far better to have Jabba remain a mystery until you finally meet him  adds nothing to the film. It seems to be nothing more than an effects test for the prequels that followed closely on the heels of the '97 special edition release of the original trilogy.Of course, the most controversial addition/alteration to Star Wars is Greedo shooting first. Quite why Lucas did this, I'm not sure, but it dilutes Han's character. The reason why he was every kid's favourite is that he was a badass. But now he's a slightly more ordinary hero. And although the alteration didn't rape my childhood like some pathetic fanboys exclaimed, it does reflect poorly on Lucas  the tinkering is pointless.But even though some of the alterations are annoying, Lucas can't destroy a very enjoyable film. For instance, in light of the dire attempts at humour in the prequels, it's quite shocking how amusing Star Wars is. Just take the banter between the robots  they're like a bickering couple. And then you have the Han and Chewie relationship. Who knew that an ex-carpenter and an overgrown dog could have such good chemistry? And then you have pure slapstick moments like when R2-D2 gets captured by the Jawas  the way R2 falls over with a thud is magnificent.But the film also has pathos. Take the scene where Luke looks at the setting suns, yearning for adventure, or when he's confronted with the dead bodies of his guardians. It's here that the film comes closest to transcending its B-movie origins. However, speaking of this scene, it's quite shocking to realise that this film was given a 'U' certificate in Britain. After all, this is a film where you see charred bodies and where someone gets their arm chopped off. It may not be Peckinpah, but it's not The Care Bears Movie either.Another piece of violence that I adore in this film is when Vader strangles some Rebel officer and then tosses his dead body into a wall. It's so casual. It immediately sets Vader up as the baddest man in the galaxy. Too bad Lucas had to ruin the character in the prequels.Something else that works for the film is how wet Luke is. He's the naïve, hopelessly optimistic hero that has probably never thought about a girl, let alone been with one. And then you have Han, the mercenary who loves money and is full of wisecracks. Both are a million miles away from the bland Jedi that poisoned the second trilogy. These are people that you can invest in and care for  they feel like flesh and blood, as opposed to the characters in the prequels, who talk and behave like automatons.And purely from a personal point of view, I love the stromtroopers in this film. They must be the most hopeless fighting force in the universe. Not only can't they shoot straight, but they're irredeemably stupid, too. Just take the scene where they're scouting Mos Eisley for our heroes. At one point they tap on a door, proclaim it to be locked and move on. That's real thorough! And then you have the scene where the Millennium Falcon is swallowed by the Death Star. Some stormtroopers walk in, and after a two second search, proclaim it to be empty. Wonderful! And another thing I love is the way they don't bat an eyelid when one of their pals gets gunned down by Princess Leia at the beginning. Stupid and heartless; a wonderful combination (clumsy too, as proved by the infamous scene where one of the morons clonks his head on a door).But a few other things that I've pondered over the years  why is Vader always fiddling with his joystick in his TIE fighter, why does an overly enthusiastic rebel pilot excessively bounce in his cockpit and why does Obi Wan only become a ghost instead of becoming 'more powerful than you can possibly imagine'? I doubt we'll ever have the answers...",Null,2,3,1 July 2007
Apollo 13," A real space odyssey
","Ron Howard is a solid if unspectacular director. He's capable of making enjoyable films, but they often feel trite and uninspired. However, with Apollo 13 he comes closet to making something that achieves greatness.But it must be said that it would take an unspeakably awful filmmaker to make a poor movie about the Apollo 13 story. All you have to do is stick close to the facts, film it and not get in the way. And I guess that's what Howard does, for his directing style is pretty anonymous and his viewpoint is narrow  the film doesn't really concern itself with the politics of Apollo. And while in some cases that could hurt a film, here it's the right decision, because rather than try and be a critique of the space programme it's the simple story of a bunch of guys trying to get home  too much commentary would detract from the drama.Not that there isn't the odd bit of commentary here and there. There's a good scene where the astronauts are broadcasting from their craft, not knowing that the TV networks have dumped them  already space exploration has become boring. And there's also the scene where the media try and set up shop on Marilyn Lovell's lawn  the media are only interested in the mission once the crew are in jeopardy. And on top of this you get a few digs at NASA bureaucracy. But aside from that, the film assumes you're in awe of space exploration and that you agree with the Apollo programme.And while the flag waving nature of the film with its patriotic music, long pauses and hushed voices is its weakness, it's also its strength, because as absurd and expensive as space travel is, it still touches something deep inside. There's something moving about a bunch of guys risking their lives to push the boundaries. And although Teflon is the greatest thing that space exploration has produced, there's a sense of wonder and pride in knowing that men have managed to break the shackles of the Earth and walked on the Moon (anyone who thinks the landings were hoaxed should be shot  conspiracy theorists are perhaps even more worthless than Goths).Therefore there's quite a bit of emotion when Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) realises that he wont be walking on the Moon. This is his dream and its been dashed. And there's a great scene when the craft orbits the Moon. Knowing that he won't be walking on it, he refuses to look, knowing that to gaze upon it would be torture. But despite his reluctance, his resolve eventually cracks and when he turns back round he imagines what it would have been like to walk on the surface. It's a small moment of fantasy, but it brilliantly illustrates the joy that has been denied this man.Less effective is the scene where Lovell explains the lunar landing to his son. The intention is okay  to make light of the risks for the sake of family  but the kid is a little too cutesy. And I also dislike the scenes with Lovell's mother. She's a dotty old woman and serves as the film's comic relief  she asks Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin whether they're part of the space programme. But the film should have either made her more believable or dispensed with her entirely.Much more effective are the scenes with mission control. Ed Harris is great as always and there are some moments of real tension. Plus the scenes with mission control show what a team effort it was to bring the astronauts back home. And I even forgave the film scenes of mass whooping, because although a bunch of loud-mouthed Americans whooping usually irritates the hell out of me, I was almost joining in. I felt like punching the air when the rocket took off and I felt like raising the roof when the crew landed in the Pacific  finally here's something worth whooping about.Another of the film's strengths is its attention to detail. All the technical jargon, all the confusing buttons and all the convoluted procedures have a convincing air of authenticity. And it also helps that some of the scenes were shot in zero G. It allows you to concentrate on the story (dodgy effects would have been a huge distraction). And the zero G produces a couple of wonderful moments, the first being Bill Paxton puking chunks (we've all wondered what weightless vomiting would look like) and the second occurring during the television broadcast that was ditched for baseball when Paxton throws his sunglasses at the camera  it captures the fun of space.But really the film works best as the story of a bunch of guys trying to get back home (and it's apt that one of the craft was named Odyssey, as the journey has a lot in common with Homer's epic poem). And while that means that the film doesn't have a whole lot to say on an intellectual level, it works superbly on an emotional one.",Null,0,1,2 September 2006
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Interview With a Whining Sadsack
","Prior to Interview With the Vampire it had always seemed like quite a fun idea to be a bloodsucker. Not only do you get to spend eternity feasting on large bosomed women, but you get to stay up late, too. Who could ask for more? Well, Neil Jordan put pay to those notions. Here we have vampires who wallow in guilt, act bored and feed on rats. In other words, immortality sucks.However, the film doesn't. And the film succeeds because it makes the undead the focus of the story rather than being a sideshow. For once they're allowed to be something other than monsters. But that's not to say that everything in the film works. For example, why do vampires always have to have long hair? Is this part of the curse of being immortal  that you can't have a decent haircut? Indeed, this may very well be the case, as there's a scene in the film that addresses this very issue. At one point Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) hacks her hair off only to see it grow back. No wonder so many vampires go mental.Another vampiric cliché I can't get my head around are the clothes. Does getting bitten suddenly give you a taste for rumpled cuffs and billowing shirts? Of course this is mainly a result of the goth subculture that has appropriated these types of stories, but I can't help but feel that nothing is less practical as regards bloodsucking than a large white shirt  eating spaghetti Bolognese in a similar sort of garb is bad enough.But the goth influence, for better or worse, is present through the whole story. For instance you have the main character's perpetual moaning. Now, in less assured hands, this could have rendered the film unwatchable, but Jordan juggles the tone expertly, including enough soul searching and despair to make it interesting, but never wallowing in it. Another goth influence is the rampant homoeroticism. More than once it seems that we're going to have some hot man on man vampire love action, but it never actually materialises. Instead what you have is story about a thinly veiled gay couple. Take the first encounter between Lestat and Louis. Louis is bitten and then shown ascending to the heavens in a painful but orgasmic embrace. And then later you have Lestat's desperate attempts to ensure that his 'companion' doesn't stray. He gives Louis a daughter and they become a dysfunctional family.However, I think the family aspect is one of the film's most successful elements. It allows room for the characters to develop and it also provides some much needed humour. One of my favourite bits has to be when Claudia is seen killing various hired hands. There's a dressmaker who gets bitten and then, best of all, a piano teacher gets killed  the comic timing, with the man's head striking the piano at the right moment, is wonderful. And I also love the way that Lestat is only annoyed that she's killing in their household  she's disciplined like she hasn't tidied her room properly.But while there are plenty of humorous moments, the film does also have some more disturbing scenes. For example, there's the prolonged killing of a buxom wench who gets to experience her own coffin (but even that scene has some dry humour). And then you have an attractive woman getting fed on at a pretentious French vampire theatre. Both scenes don't hold back and help lend the film a seriousness and weight that is seldom seen in a genre that is often bogged down by camp.Another excellent scene that pulls no punches is the scene where Louis exacts his revenge on a group of garlic eating bloodsuckers. He burns them and chops them into pieces. And it's kind of what you've always been waiting for someone to do in a vampire film. After all, I can't be the only one who's wondered whether so called immortal creatures would be so immortal if you chopped them in half and burnt them to a crispcan I? Obviously not.And that leads me to another wonderful scene. I love the re-emergence of Lestat after he's 'murdered'. It's superbly filmed with Cruise obscured by billowing curtains as he plays the piano. And the idea of him having to survive on the blood of crocodiles, toads and snakes is a magnificent one.And it must be pointed out that Cruise is excellent in the film. As he's proved recently there's something rather disturbing under the million dollar grin, and it certainly comes out here. In fact, I always think he's more convincing as a bastard. Magnolia, Collateral and Rain Man are other prime examples. But one negative that comes out of his presence is the fact that the film suffers when he's not there. I mean, Pitt is pretty good in the film, but his role is rather thankless. Louis certainly isn't a barrel of laughs (unlike Lestat who has lots of memorable moments, one of my favourites being his dance with Claudia's dead mother  I love the way he drops her dead body on the floor like she's a piece of trash).Almost as memorable as Lestat, though, is Kirsten Dunst's performance as Claudia. Petulant and greedy, she pulls off a difficult character with ease. Indeed, it's rather strange seeing Dunst perform so well, because she's certainly failed to live up to her early promise in her adult roles.The only weak link in the film is Banderas. There's nothing behind the posturing and half of his dialogue is unintelligible. But the magnificent visuals, lush score and impressive production values make his presence easy to forget  sure the film is one of glittering surfaces with petulant whining masquerading as depth, but the film has enough going for it to make the shortcomings easy to forgive.",Null,1,3,11 February 2007
Sin City," Good fun, but nothing more
","Ever since I saw the trailer I've been looking forward to seeing Sin City. The visual style and the potential for a tough, gritty film hooked me. But one thing nagged at me. I've never seen a Robert Rodriguez film I've liked. Sure I've only seen 'Desperado' and 'From Dusk Till Dawn', but they were enough to put me off him. He's truly the king of style over substance. Both of those films are so thin that they snap if you try and take a close look at them. Plus the action in both is incredibly tedious and repetitive.So how does Sin City fare? Did it make me think any differently about Rodriguez? No, not really. He's still a director uncomfortable with narrative. However, Sin City is stylish. Very much so. And it's also violent, nasty and pretty good fun to boot. It's just a shame that the fantastic images are cobbled together by some lousy storytelling.The worst offender is the first big story - the Marv story. It moves at such a pace and lumbers forward so incoherently that I was really fearing for the film. Characters were given about five seconds set-up and then they were usually dispatched. And the scenes just rattled by. You're never given any time to adjust to the world. You're never given any time to get to know the character. It's relentless. And while the premise itself is rather good, the execution is poor. Basically Marv falls in love after five seconds, the woman gets killed after ten and after thirty seconds Marv is on a rampage to avenge her death. It's all rather silly. But instead of laughing with the film, I was laughing at it. Surely the film had to get better...Thankfully, it did. The second big story, while again rather flawed, was an improvement on the first. It flowed better, it actually had a set-up and it had some good gallows humour. However, it was perhaps the most adolescent story - although to be fair the whole film is aimed at horny teenagers. Just the whole idea of a bunch of gun-welding prostitutes with great bodies and amazing killing skills makes me laugh. It's very much a male fantasy, as is the idea that women get a kick out of being hit. To be honest, the violence in the film didn't bother me one iota, but the film just has a pubescent feeling to it. Everything is pitched at horny boys.The final big story I thought was the best. It was the only one that had me gripped from beginning to end. But having said this, the story is far from original. It could be from any cheap paperback novel. But unlike the other stories it does almost succeed in engaging me on something more than just a visceral level. As familiar as the territory is, there was something quite touching about the man in solitary confinement, waiting for a child's letter as he does time for a crime he didn't commit. And I loved the moment when Jessica Alba jumps from the stage to hug Willis. It has real feeling. And their awkward romance, while done a million times before, was well done too. Therefore, the revenge story that followed I found very satisfying.So although my feelings are mixed, I ended up enjoying the film. It may add up to nothing and it may get off to a bad start, but in the end it turns out to be bloody good fun.",Null,1,2,16 June 2005
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Not quite as last as we thought (spoilers)
","As a nine-year-old kid, during sport's day no less, I passed on the opportunity to go and see Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. My rationale at that time, having seen Raiders of the Lost Ark and been terrified by a scene where snakes crawled out of the mouths of skeletons, I decided that it was bound to include something that would have me mess my pants. And yeah it does include a couple of things that would be scary to a little snot-nosed scaredy-pants kid, but it's actually a much lighter Jones film. If anything it's more a comedy than an action film.In some quarters that's grounds for consternation. Some people think it's far too jokey. They prefer the all-out action of Raiders or the darkness of Temple. But although I can kind of see their point, I think Last Crusade works wonderfully on its own terms. Certainly, with Indy accompanied by his father, it ensures that we're seeing something fresh, that we're not going over the same ground again. And as for the jokes, well, they either work or they don't, and I think they work superbly.For instance, how can you not enjoy the idea of father and son unknowingly sleeping with the same woman? It's a terrible blow to Indy's ego to think that his dad had slept with a hot blonde before him and as well as being amusing it also gives Indy's dad an extra dimension  at the beginning we think of him as we all think of our fathers, completely sexless, but the revelation here makes him more human and ultimately allows the two characters to bond (they come to understand one another better, realising that they're not quite as different as they think they are).I also enjoy the scene in Berlin where Indiana is confronted with Adolf Hitler. It's a great little moment, played to perfection. And how can I forget the crowd-pleasing moment when Indiana punches out a Nazi officer and throws him out of a zeppelin before announcing that he had 'no ticket'? (By the way, is it just me or does the Nazi officer Colonel Vogel look remarkably like David Gilmour?) However, funnier than all these moments, for me, is the scene where Sallah picks up Marcus Brody at the train station. The two are quickly accosted by a couple of Nazis, who demand to see their papers. Sallah then, while telling Brody to run, produces a newspaper and punches one of the Nazis in the face through it. Honestly, is there anything better in the world than punching someone in the face through a newspaper? I somehow doubt it.I also enjoy the scene where Indy gets his tonsils sucked out by Dr Elsa Schneider. 'Ah, Venice,' he sighs. And after Kate Capshaw in Temple of Doom, it makes a nice change to have a female character with a bit of spunk. And Dr Elsa Schneider further proves my theory that the best film villainesses are sexual deviants. After all, here's a woman who sleeps with father and son and who cops off with a man as he's tied to a chair. There's nothing not to like about her (let's just ignore her Nazi sympathies).But as funny as Last Crusade is, it does also contain a few wonderful small moments that help elevate it about your standard action/adventure fare. In particular I like the scene where the tomb of Sir Richard is found. The music is wonderful, as is Ford's acting  'giddy like a schoolboy,' says Dr Schneider. And then there's the scene that bookends this where Indy tells his father that he found the tomb. Again the music and the acting make it. And there's also the scene at the end when Indy is dangling over the edge of a precipice while being held by his father. He tries reaching for the grail, but then for the first time his father calls him by the name 'Indiana'. Almost instantly Indy is broken free from the trance he's in and lets his father help him up. It's a nice way of showing that his relationship with his father has more worth than this object they've both been searching for.Another small little moment I like in this film is when the knight who guards the grail is confronted with Indiana. 'You're strangely dressed for a knight.' Once again the combination of fantastic acting with a magnificent score elevates the film immensely. And I also like the way that after being confronted with his first visitor in 700 years another couple of people turn up. Geez, immortality is like buses. You wait 700 years for someone to turn up and then three arrive at once! However, the film doesn't exactly paint a fun view of immortality. The poor bloke is stuck in a temple for the rest of eternity with only a book and lots of cups to keep him company. How boring would that be? No wonder he has plenty of time to refine his sarcasm. 'He chosepoorly.' What a great line delivery that is.Where the next film will go, though, to keep things fresh, I have no idea. We've already had elements of science-fiction, musical and comedy, as well as the obvious action and adventure. Oh well, I'll still be looking forward to it. Indy hasn't let me down...yet.",Null,1,5,15 July 2007
Goodfellas," A masterpiece (spoilers)
","The opening to Goodfellas  the murder of Billy Batts  shows the beginning of the end of Henry Hill. Up until that point, despite the thieving and the violence, everything is rather light-hearted. There's a sense of solidarity amongst the criminals. But once Batts is murdered, infighting, greed and addiction take over. The life will get you in the end.But the opening scenes are great at establishing the allure of being a gangster. After all, as the movies have always shown, it's a very seductive world. I mean, who wouldn't want to be able to thumb their nose in the face of the law if they could get away with it? Therefore it's totally right that the film shows you all the fun aspects of this criminal life. And at the beginning the camera focuses on all the accoutrements of gangsterism  jewellery, shoes, cars etc. They're almost like movie stars.And at the beginning the violence is even intended to seduce you. There's a great bit where Henry's postman is threatened with an oven to make sure he doesn't give any school letters to Henry's parents. The way it's shot and scored makes it seem like something of a lark. You're asked to acknowledge and respect the power and audacity of these guys. And the icing on the cake is the final-freeze frame of the terrified postman's face  these guys control life and death; if you don't respect them you're going in the oven.But freeze-frames occur frequently in the early part of the film. There's a powerful shot where Henry's dad is beating him with a belt and it's stopped right in the middle of the whipping. It makes the beating seem even more violent than it already is and it makes you understand and identify with Henry's rebellion; soon no one will be able to do that to him again. However, the most famous freeze-frame in the film is when Henry sets the cars on fire. The image is held as Henry makes a Christ-like pose with flames behind him  he's finally in the life; welcome to hell.And another early scene I like is when the young Henry gets pinched. He thinks the guys will be mad at him for getting caught, but because he keeps his mouth shut he's welcomed from the court like a conquering hero. And the scene even ends with another freeze-frame. It might as well be a family portrait.But the good times extend into Henry's adult life. He steals trucks, makes lots of money and even falls in love. And this leads to another great scene  the long Steadicam shot when Henry takes Karen to the Copacabana. This is her seduction. This is when she is seduced by the life. And another seduction is the scene where Henry pummels one of Karen's neighbours. He's supposed to have touched Karen so Henry rearranges his face with the butt of his gun. But although it's incredibly violent and although the sound effects make you wince, you can see why Karen would be turned on. How many other men would do this for her? How many other men would protect her in such a brutal way? Not many.However, like I said at the beginning, Billy Batts is when everything begins to go downhill. From that point on the murders become more frequent and collective greed is overtaken by personal greed. But I do have to say that the Batts murder is my favourite scene. The dialogue and the timing between Joe Pesci and Frank Vincent is outstanding and the beating has so much emotion. You kind of get whipped up in it yourself. You can feel what it must be like to get your on back on someone you hate. And the choice of music ('Atlantis' by Donovan) is perfect. It raises the scene to another level.But Scorsese's choice of music is always spot-on. The other musical highlight has to be his use of the closing music in 'Layla'. It's a beautiful piece, which makes it work well with the grisly murders it shows  the images kind of show an end of an era, which, what with the music, lends the whole sequence a strange kind of romanticism. And it also works well because the emotion of the song and the final piece of music go hand in hand with what Jimmy (De Niro) is feeling at the time  the song and the music is about yearning for someone and then having that love fulfilled, and Jimmy is beside himself with pleasure that Tommy (Pesci) is being made. He thinks his dreams are finally coming true.Unfortunately, though, that sequence is when the real nightmare kicks in. After this, Henry becomes an addict and screws up so bad that he has to betray his friends. And the sequence that shows the day of his arrest is rather amazing. Again Scorsese proves himself to be a master of using music to emphasise emotion and mood, and it's shot in such a way with zooms and fast edits that you feel as strung out as Henry. It's coke film-makingbut in a good way.And I also like the final scene between Jimmy and Karen. With smiles and promises he tries to whack her, but she gets scared and manages to get away. It's a good way of showing what's wrong with this life without moralising  in this life you can never truly trust your friends; and who really wants to live like that? But at the end, despite everything, you also get to see that Henry misses his life. And although it's supremely arrogant of him to say that he gets to live the rest of his life like a schnook, you sort of know what he means. If only he and his pals weren't so damn greedy they would have had it made.",Null,3,5,6 May 2006
Atonement," A decent adaptation (spoilers throughout)
","My main problem with the film adaptation of Atonement, like the novel, is the ending. Here we have a character, Briony Tallis, who as a thirteen-year-old girl splits up a young couple and sends a young man, Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), to jail by falsifying evidence. Years later she realises what she did was wrong and tries to atone for her mistakes. But the way that she tries to do it seems wrong to me.You see, Briony is a writer, and as a precocious thirteen-year-old girl she attempts to put on a play called The Trials of Arabella. Full of self-importance it promises to be a ridiculous piece. But then as a successful writer, and diagnosed with a terminal disease, she writes a novel about her experiences  about the way she destroyed a burgeoning love affair. She claims it's entirely autobiographical. And before this we have a powerful scene where an eighteen-year-old Briony, now a nurse in the Second World War, confronts the couple she attempted to split up (the woman in the relationship, played by Keira Knightley, is her sister). Full of anger and regret, it shows how Briony is trying to make things up. She wants to right the wrongs she made.But then as the older Briony talks at the end, we find out, even though she said the entire book was autobiographical, that this scene is a fiction. Briony never really met her sister during the war. She never met Robbie. Indeed, Robbie never even made it back from Dunkirk. He died of septicaemia. And Cecilia (Knightley) died in an Underground station during the Blitz. What kind of atonement is this? It's meant to be some kind of offering to the world, to show how glorious their love could be. And it's also meant to be a way of immortalising their love, to allow them to live on. But personally, I think it suggests that Briony hasn't learnt a single thing. She's still the silly little girl living in her dream world. She still can't accept reality. In fact, the old Briony explains her reasons for not including the actual events by saying it wouldn't be satisfactory for her readers. Well, maybe it wouldn't, but at least, for once, it would be the truth  a novel concept for the rather wretched Briony Tallis.Aside from this, though, I enjoyed the film. And I even have to say that the ending moved me somewhat. But it didn't move me because of Briony's 'atonement'. It moved me because Robbie and Cecilia's love was never fulfilled. There's something touching about the banality of Robbie's death, that such a strong will to survive and that such a determined desire to return home can be extinguished so easily.Another moving scene is the one where an eighteen-year-old Briony has to comfort a dying French soldier. I can remember it being the most powerful scene in the novel, and it's equally powerful here. I think it's the first time that Briony ever realises what love really is, that it isn't a selfish need to possess another human being (her betrayal of Robbie is entirely motivated by feelings of rejection) but a simple desire to make another person happy. Therefore, when she talks to this dying soldier, a man who's delirious and who seems to think that he knows her from the past, you get a proper sense that she's atoning for her mistakes. I really think it's near impossible for her to untangle the mess she made with Robbie and Cecilia, but the simple way she says 'Yes' when the young soldier asks her whether she loves him is so sweet and kind and unselfish that you feel that she's finally beginning to act selflessly.However, my favourite scene in the film occurs when Robbie enters Dunkirk. There's a wonderfully cinematic sequence where the camera floats through the beach and into the town. Around you soldiers lie down to sleep, others fight and some even congregate to sing. And then in the background you have drunk soldiers staggering about and others destroying machinery and vehicles so that the Germans can't use them. It's done in such a simple, elegant way. Plus it economically communicates the despair and desperation of the situation. These men can almost see home  they can almost see it on the horizon  but it still seems so far away.It's curious, though, that while, in the novel, I wasn't particularly inspired by the Dunkirk sequence, I loved the opening. But in the film I feel it's the weakest section. For me it just didn't have the claustrophobia, the passion and the intensity it has in the book. But maybe the film was always going to struggle with this section  in writing you can kind of tolerate the young Briony, but brought to life she's rather wretched and annoying. Plus Keira Knightley is never totally convincing. She doesn't embarrass herself, but she does lack charm and sex appeal. And she also has a habit of trying too hard  just look at her mouth when she says 'come back to me' to Robbie; her lips look almost disfigured, she's trying so hard to impress. But when she relaxes, she actually fairly capable. There's a lovely little moment when she holds Robbie's hand. There's no pouting, no exaggeration  just a nice bit of warmth and feeling.But these problems aside, Atonement is a decent adaptation of Ian McEwan's novel. I certainly don't think it should be involved in the upcoming Oscar race, but it deserves to be kindly remembered.",Null,5,9,16 September 2007
