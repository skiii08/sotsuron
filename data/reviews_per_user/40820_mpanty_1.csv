Requiem for a Dream," Smashing, stunning, mindbreaking!!
","This film will get you into the loop of 3 drug addicts, and another that will eventually become one, in an incredible mix of emotions!! Drama at its best!! The original soundtrack matches perfectly, and Aronofsky's directing is absolutely flawless!!",10,0,1,5 March 2002
