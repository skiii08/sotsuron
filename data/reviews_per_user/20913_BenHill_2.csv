The Blair Witch Project," City Slickers just don't get it...
","Movie-goers from a city or residential household can never truly appreciate the true horror of the Blair Witch Project.  They have lived and grown up in a totally safe and well-lit environment.  I, on the other hand, have lived in a very remote rural area in the woods, and this film has brought back skeletons from my closet.  When i came home from the theater, i basically came back to the setting for the film.  I have roamed around the woods, but never at night, even before the film i have always been too scared.  Now, i doubt i will ever go.  It is just too creepy.  A broken down home was also featured in the ending.  Houses like those are common place where i live.  i have been in the houses, and seeing them on the silver screen just makes my heart stop.  I picture myself standing in the corner and i can't handle it. If you have lived near the woods your whole life, you can understand the fear-unknown noises, isolation, and total Darkness.The basis for the movie is evil, and i am glad to be going back to school, because it's a little too creepy to be hanging out around the woods...and a Civil War Battlefield with its own Ghosts....The mind and the imagination just run too wild.",Null,1,2,26 August 1999
Saving Private Ryan," The Most Realistic War Movie Ever Made
","Spielburg's epic of the quest for one man is not so simple. There is much more involved in the story. The first twenty minutes show the horror and brutality of war.My jaw was wide open.  I could not believe it.  I had never seen this aspect of war before.  I knew about it, but it didn't register.  It made me think of all the other battles--Gettysburg--and movements not only in Europe but also in the Pacific.  Men died for me, and I took this freedom for granted. After the highly ironic ending I was glued to my seat.  I was so touched that I could not move.  I could only sit and continue to realize that this really happened.  Tom Hanks gives an excellent performance and is greatly assisted by the supporting roles. The score that John Williams composed does not steal the show, but it also adds to the overall impact of the film. The story is only a script, but it is truer to life than ever before.  The cinamatography adds to the effect.  By seeing war for what it is, (There are no winners)I hope and pray we never go to war in haste again.",10,0,0,29 September 1998
