Blade Runner 2049," Just More Codswallop Dished Out By Hollywood...
","It's hard to explain how moronic this film is without giving away any crucial plot points, so I'll just say that it completely disregards everything we learned in the original 'Bladerunner.' Replicants now have indeterminate lifespans, and can somehow reproduce. Apparently, due to BS ret-conning, this was the Tyrell Corporation's goal all along...Now, the film does have topnotch F/X and cinematography, but at 2 hrs and 45 mins, it's both painfully and absurdly long. Ford and Leto turn in good performances. Gosling is ho-hum as usual, and Robin Wright seems woefully miscast as a tough, cynical, whiskey-swilling police chief.There's a fight scene at the beginning which I thought was horribly choreographed, and played for laughs, which doesn't fit the overall mood of the film. Or maybe I wasn't supposed to laugh at Bautista repeatedly slamming Gosling into a wall like they were in a cartoon...Also, there's a scene involving Gosling, his A.I. wife, and a surrogate lover that's straight ripped from the superior film: 'Her,' which, if you haven't seen, I highly recommend.And whatever you do, don't go into this film expecting anything as brilliant or profound as the 'tears in rain' soliloquy from the original, because you'll be sorely disappointed.All in all, 'Bladerunner 2049' is just more codswallop dished out by Hollywood. I'm infinitely glad I didn't waste three hours of my life in the theater on it.",4,3,5,30 January 2018
