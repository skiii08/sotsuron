Deja Vu," good...good movie
",This is not the first time a movie has been made on the concept of time travel or seeing the past. To use the similar concept and to make such good movie requires lot of hard work. Deja Vu is damn good film and every one should watch it.The acting is pretty good. Everything makes sense in the end of the film. There are no questions unanswered. Director Tony Scott has made a film which never loose you in between the film.When I went to see this film I expected it be another butterfly effect but it turned out to be very intelligent film. Action sequences are well directed. Each scene has its own value.,9,2,4,26 November 2006
