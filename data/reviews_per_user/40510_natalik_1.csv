Black Swan," Nothing more than a bundle of humiliating clich√©s
","Yes. This movie is disgracefully awful. Sigh. I've just returned from the cinema and had to write here, because I read so many misleading reviews that referred to this movie as a 'masterpiece'. Perhaps a masterpiece of emptiness. It has nothing in it, no matter where you try to look from, no matter how many fingers will be shoved in unbecoming places. Such an amateur work is suitable for a 1st year student who still hasn't been cured yet of superficial story patterns. *Everything* in this movie, with no single exception, is screaming of banality. The characters, their characteristics, their actions, the turn of events. It's all one big yawn, following childish formulas so blindly. Do yourselves a favor and don't go to see it..Better go watch 'The Piano Teacher', the striking French movie which succeeds in doing what this movie can only dream of... you see, I'm not against some disturbance and provocation, but even that can be brought to an artistic level or, as we see in 'Black Swan', be thrown everywhere without any depth to back it up...",1,53,92,3 March 2011
