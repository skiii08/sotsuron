Minority Report," Pretty Fun And Interesting But Far From Perfect
","Minority Report is a film that will keep you interested and is enjoyable, but I can't help but notice some things that aren't quite right with it. It's plot is complicated enough for it to hold some plot holes which can be glaring at times. It's visual style sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. And honestly, it feels kinda dated watching it in 2014.The plot of this movie is intriguing, but I find that perhaps it was more sci-fi in 2002 then it is now. Certain aspects and technology we can kind of see today, so it does take away from the experience. It also seems pretty open to plot holes, as if certain aspects weren't quite thought through. Also, the tone is kind of all over the place. It is a serious film most of the time, but it has a LOT of comedic moments that honestly just feel out of place. Scenes such as the weird eye doctor mesh a little better, but the comedy in the jet pack cops chase just feels like some kind of Buster Keaton skit in the middle of a drama. It's really odd and just didn't work most of the time.The visual style of the film is kind of all over the place too. Sometimes it feels way too blue, as if it was color corrected wrong, where other times it's just the right amount of futuristic blue tinting. There's also a lot of bright lighting that causes a bloom effect and it just sometimes felt over done and as if the image was blown out.Honestly, I'm kinda conflicted with this film. I enjoyed it in one way, but I also noticed a lot of flaws. I guess that just makes it an okay movie. I wouldn't say you need to go out and find a copy of this to watch, but if it's on TV one night, check it out.",7,0,0,2 November 2014
If I Stay," Boring And Poorly Made
","The trailer to this film made it look decent, so I was hoping to enjoy it... But I really didn't. This film just isn't good. It has almost all flaws and very few positives to it.To start off with, the story is an interesting concept, but it's executed in a way that is extremely cliché. The story has your typical plot points that a lot of cheesy romance films have. The fight, the make up, etc. We really don't see a lot of the in between dead and alive kind of stuff, and even that isn't executed. It got so cliché that it started making me incredibly bored. I wanted to yell 'STAY OR DON'T, JUST MAKE A DECISION!'. It really just doesn't work.What make this story worse is the acting. It can be pretty bad. Chloe Moretz just isn't very good. I haven't seen much of her work, but I just don't see why she would be cast in a lead role. She is cute, but her acting just can't hold a film together, especially a film with such an emotion driven plot. I didn't feel for her in the least bit, which completely ruins the film. It was very tough to get through.Another little detail that I couldn't get over was the CGI head. I'm sure you're asking, what does that mean? Let me explain. Chloe plays a character who plays the chello extremely well. I am assuming Chloe doesn't know how to play it, because in scenes where we see her playing it, they obviously CGI her head onto the body of someone who knows how to play, and the issue is, it's extremely obvious. Her head floats and bobs and looks so odd. What's worse is that in shots where it's from the side, you can tell it's not even Chloe at all! They don't attempt to CGI her head from the side, but just leave the different actress who you can tell from the side isn't Chloe. It was so distracting and I couldn't help but laugh at how bad that was.Overall, if you wanna see this film, just watch the trailer and then find out whether she stays or not. The trailer gives you a better emotional journey than the film as a whole does.",5,4,9,31 August 2014
Lone Survivor," It's Hard To Say Where Exactly I Stand On This Film
","'That's not a knife, that's a f***ing duck.' That line is too good to not be mentioned in this review. This film really has me conflicted. I heard really good things about it when it came out, so I thought it would go above and beyond the usual military hero movie, but i'm not sure if it did. The strongest part of this film has to be the whole sequence of the squad being attacked by the Taliban. There are lots of great blood and gore effects that help make their injuries feel realistic, and you really feel bad for these guys. They go through so much and the movie does not pull any punches. One of the biggest things I can't quite make my mind up about is whether or not I think the film is too 'hurrah USA!' or not. The last little bit of the film feels too Hollywood, which would make you think so, but the amount of terrible things that happen to the characters makes me think otherwise. Regardless, I really respect the real men who died during this mission in real life, and the sequence at the end where they show real pictures of the men is quite moving, especially when we see footage from one of the men's wedding videos. Touching stuff.I think the performances were pretty good all around. Mark Wahlberg is the main character, and he does a good job, but I actually think Ben Foster would have been more interesting in the role of the lead, because I found his performance extremely interesting and impressive.There were also some things in this that I found humorous that i'm almost certain aren't supposed to be. The 'f***ing duck' quote is obviously supposed to get a laugh, but i'm not sure about Mark Wahlberg yelling 'i'm gonna f***ing kill you!' over and over at a group of Afghan men and a kid while holding a grenade. I couldn't help but laugh and I don't think that was the response the director wanted. Also the way one of the falling down the cliff sequences was edited almost seemed like he kept falling down the same slope and hitting the same rock, which made me laugh once again when I know it was supposed to be serious. I'm not one of those idiots who laughs at things all the time, I just don't think these scenes we're done well.Overall, this is a good movie. Not great, just good. Take from it what you will. It certainly is an interesting story based on a real event, and I think that makes it worth a watch.",7,0,0,14 June 2014
Fury," It's Good To See A War Film Like This Being Made
","Fury is the kind of film that I feel like doesn't get made often. It's a very 'Saving Private Ryan' kind of WWII film, although this one has the twist of it being focused on a tank crew. I must say that I enjoyed this film quite a bit.Fury is the kind of war film that looks closely at the mentality of the soldiers. We see things that are horrifying and make you wonder about the state of some of these people, but we also see the human side. I think it fairly displays the kind of people that go to war. It doesn't say that they are all psychotic killers, but it certainly doesn't shy away from the brutality that is war. We see people being torn apart by explosions or burning to death, and it's all there for us to witness, really shocking the audience by not pulling any punches. I think the themes it discusses and the way it's handled really make the character drama work.The whole tank crew comes together quite well. We see the characters in different situations and we establish quite well what kind of people they are. Brad Pitt is the leader, Logan Lerman is the wimpy guy who doesn't exactly want to be there, Shia LaBeouf is the religious guy, and so on. There's even an extended sequence in a German home where the men sit at a table eating eggs, which reminded me of the plantation scene in Apocalypse Now Redux, except in this case I think it worked to establish characters further, where in Redux it just screwed up the pacing. By the end of the film, you're with these characters and want them to make it through these events. I also found all of the sets, props, and costumes to be really good. It all felt authentic (which apparently some of it was according to IMDb trivia) and it heightened the films realism. Its always good to see such good production values in a historical film. Fury is a great mix of both drama and war that really works. It brings up themes regarding war that can really get you thinking about how terrible it all is. The enemy may seem like pure evil because they're trying to kill you, but they are human too. There might be someone who is a lot like you but just so happens to be on the other side of the battlefield. War is hell, and Fury doesn't try to sugar coat it.",8,2,6,7 November 2014
Akira," Visually Breathtaking and Extremely Enjoyable
","Akira is the kind of anime film that even people who don't really like anime can watch and enjoy. It's visually breathtaking and has a very creative and interesting story that will keep you engaged. There's a lot of different elements involved in this story. A futuristic Tokyo, biker gangs, secret military operations, kids with powers, and even some blood and guts. It's certainly a story that you haven't seen before. I found myself quite engaged in the story and constantly was wondering what exactly was happening. Not to spoil anything, but even in the end there are some elements that are left for you to interpret yourself. But it will certainly satisfy you once things come to a close.Visually, this movie is a feast for the eyes. I watched it on Bluray, and it's gorgeous. The colors pop, and everything looks great. I haven't seen many other animated films like this on bluray, but i'm sure this is one of the best looking ones. Another element of this film that I really have to commend is the audio. I watched it with the remastered Japanese audio on the bluray, and it sound phenomenal. It blows away the English dubs that are also on the disc. Every little sound is audible, and it all comes together to be a perfect audio experience. I also LOVE the soundtrack. It totally fits the mood of the film and is great to listen to. I usually don't notice audio in a film as a whole, but you can't help but notice it here. It's perfect.Akira is quite an experience. Its highly original and should certainly be watched. I would recommend buying the Bluray from Funimation, because it looks and sounds absolutely top notch. You won't be disappointed.",9,3,6,14 November 2014
The Notebook," Cheesy But Saved By Its Lead Performances
","The Notebook is a well known film. If you say 'romance film', the first movie that pops into peoples minds is generally The Notebook. I would say they do because of two main reasons. The first reason being that it's written by Nicolas Sparks, the writer of tons of cheesy romance books, making it have some really cheesy elements to it, but I also believe that it's chemistry between its leads helps save this from falling flat. (Which is ironic because apparently Gosling hated McAdams when they were shooting and they didn't get along)As I said, the film is quite cheesy. It uses many clichés that romance movies use, the biggest probably being the 'rich girl loves poor boy whom her parents disapprove of' cliché. There's also a lot of unrealistically cheesy stuff with the whole Alzheimer's's thing, making it just seem ridiculous. You can tell a lot of things are written to be overly romantic or tug on your heart strings without much regard as to what makes sense. That's not to say there aren't good romantic things here. Sometimes love and romance can be cheesy in real life, that's just the way it is, so you kind of have to accept things to a certain degree. Moments such as the kiss in the rain or love scene really work, but I think that's all because of the chemistry between Gosling and McAdams. This really is a film saved by its performances. Moments that would seem awkward or cheesy if done with other actors seem more believable between Gosling and McAdams, totally boosting the quality of this film. Gosling comes across as a really love struck guy who you feel for, and McAdams pulls off that beautiful and fun but slightly naive and unsure girl role perfectly. I honestly think this movie would be another stupid film to appeal to unrealistic female fantasies if it wasn't for these performances.Overall, I think this film is well known in the romance genre for a reason. It's got cheesy moments but stuff that works. I do believe, however, that it's way more easily enjoyed by people who are currently in love or in a relationship or whatever, because if you haven't experienced it, you just won't feel the feelings that Gosling and McAdams wonderfully express in their best moments. If you're single and lonely... you will hate this film big time.",7,1,2,16 August 2014
Alien," A Classic Sci-fi Film That Has A Lot Going For It
","Alien is a classic in both the horror and sci-fi genres. It's got some really great stuff in there and is easy to enjoy. But I will say that I don't quite think it's the absolute masterpiece that a lot of people think it is. If you want to really be harsh to the film, it's essentially a typical horror slasher kind of film but in space. I don't think it should be considered that simple, but I do think that's something I noticed and kind of brought it down a little bit for me. But I do think its a super fun film that is certainly a classic.The plot, while not exactly super original by today's standard, is interesting. It's about a cargo ship in space that is returning to earth and ends up investigating some sort of signal that they pick up on the way, which leads to them picking up a little bit of extra cargo...cargo that kills. It was most likely more original in 1979 than it is now, but regardless I still think it works. The first half of the movie is establishing characters and location and the whole scary situation, and the second half is the intense and frightening stuff. I think for the most part the movie holds up. Yeah, there are a few practical effects that you can totally tell how they did it and see its fake, but somehow even those scenes still work. There are also some really great and intense scenes, such as the ventilation system scene, and when Brett goes to find that cat. These scenes are filled with a sense of dread and really can be scary.I must say that Sigourney Weaver gives a great performance. She feels like a strong female lead without any of that cheesy 'hey look we made a female character really cool' kind of thing going on. It feels natural and is great. She's a likable character and you feel for her in this terrible situation.Overall, I do understand why this is a classic, it's fun and quite well made, and really gets a lot right. I don't exactly think it's a 10/10 like a lot of people seem to think, but I really do think it's entertaining and influential.",7,0,1,10 August 2014
Shutter Island," Clues And Hunts Galore
","This is a very interesting and mind bending film. I won't spoil the end in this review, so I will mention the details in a very general way.I think I probably liked this film a little bit less than most people. But only a little. I thought it was an intriguing ride, but the twist kind can be predicted. If you look at this film knowing there's a twist, I think there are many clues that really help you figure it out before it's revealed. But the clues are what makes this movie fun. It's great trying to pay attention to little details that hint at what's going on, like the appearing and disappearing glass of water. It also includes some visual great flashbacks and dream sequences that I loved. I could have watched a whole movie in the style of the first dream that Teddy has of his wife. Really appealing to the eye.As I said, I think the twist is a little bit predictable, but it's still fun to figure out. I also felt almost as if the 2nd half of the film was a bit less interesting as the first part. I liked the idea of something strange going on and the character trying to figure it all out, but once we start figuring bigger things out, it became less captivating. Maybe i'm the kind of person that prefers subtle hints to things and more things left to the imagination. There are essentially two main interpretations of the ending, but in my eyes, the one that is being told to be true is the correct one. I can see why people would disagree, but too much evidence leans towards the other side. I think more room for speculation would have done this film good.It feels different than a usual Scorsese movie, and it's not his best, but it's an entertaining and thrilling film.",7,0,2,25 May 2014
Barry Lyndon," Amazingly Beautiful
","Barry Lyndon is quite the film. I had heard this was Kubricks most slow film, and while it did feel slow in certain areas, most of the time it had me enthralled. It's a beautiful and epic film, and because of it's length (3 hours and 5 minutes), you really get the feeling you have seen this mans life. I think I will start off with just the visuals of this movie. Wow. The costume and set design in this are absolutely incredible. It's also shot incredibly well. It's no surprise why it won Oscars in those categories. The whole time I watched it, I kept thinking that it didn't feel like a movie. I never imagined the cameras and crew standing there. It felt like I was witnessing people in this time period. Like I was actually there. That's the highest compliment you can give a period piece film. Every shot is beautifully framed and looks like a painting, which was actually what they aimed to do. Visually, it will just blow you away.The story is pretty great to. It spans over a large amount of time, and lots of different things happen. There are little sections where it felt like, to me, that nothing new was happening and that made the film drag a bit, but those sections were fairly short lived. The performances overall are pretty great. Ryan O'Neal sometimes left me a little underwhelmed, but he had his moments, and I thought that he did a good job when he really needed to perform. All the other side characters are great too. Everyone just seems to fit their roles. Barry Lyndon is a film that needs to be seen if you are a fan of films. It's absolutely beautiful and is quite the experience over all. Check it out.",9,4,7,13 July 2014
Pacific Rim," Fun Is The Best Word To Describe This Movie
","There seems to be a recent revival of the 'kaiju or monster genre' of film, and I am pretty happy about that. That's not to say that I'm a fan of the old style kaiju movies, but I think it's a genre that is perfect for this day and age of CGI. There is so much you can do, and this movie is an example of that. Guillermo Del Toro was certainly the right man for the job to do this film. His creativity really shines through, especially with the monsters, and it's great to see, especially if you saw it on the big screen. It's also a wonderfully colourful film, which is really visually appealing. The place where Del Toro goes wrong, however, is with the screenplay. I know there is two actual screenplay credits, but it feels like it was written heavily by Del Toro. When it comes to writing American characters or just English speaking characters in general, Del Toro isn't that great. In fact, it can be downright cheesy. But just like the recent television show The Strain, which Del Toro also wrote, the cheesy-ness kinda makes it fun. Most of the characters are stereotypes, but they are fun ones that can be easily enjoyed. Also similar to the writing of The Strain, the stand out thing with this movie is just the who general idea of the Kaiju and their attack on earth. It just feels like a really cool and creative general idea, and that keeps you on board even when the individual characters dialogue falls flat. At the end of the day, this movie is total fun. It's not some deep art house film, it's just a visually appealing and well made action film that entertains. It's certainly a movie that needs to be seen by people who like films like Godzilla and other monster movies. (Ironically enough, if you have seen the recent 2014 Godzilla remake, the two monsters that Godzilla fights are incredibly similar to two Kaiju that show up in this movie. In both films, one monster has wings and flys, and the other moves like a Gorilla. Just thought i'd mention that fun fact.)",8,0,2,28 July 2014
Nightcrawler," Jake Gyllenhaal's Performance Delivers
","If you're looking for an absolutely amazing character study of a sociopath, Nightcrawler is exactly what you need. This is the directorial debut of Dan Gilroy, and while you can see areas where he needs to tighten up his work, overall it's extremely impressive. Probably the most impressive part of this film is the performances and writing. The films characters are very well written, and the actors completely deliver it perfectly. Jake Gyllenhaal gives an Oscar worthy performance in my opinion. He plays Lou Bloom, a man who is extremely manipulative and will do anything to get what he wants to be successful. But he isn't your run of the mill kind of guy. He's a total sociopath. We are given little scenes where we see him interacting with people or just doing things inside his apartment by himself that perfectly build up his character. Gyllenhaal is amazingly intense and completely believable, and I can't say enough good things about his performance. Rene Russo also gives a performance as a woman who is also quite demented in her own way. I also think Riz Ahmed did a good work as Gyllenhaal's side kick who works with him. Overall the cast is just great and is a massive strength for the film.I think the film has a very interesting theme being looked at throughout. It's essentially about the lengths people will go to get what they want, make money, and keep a job. We see it in Gyllenhaal's character because he will steal and lie to get what he wants, and we see it in Russo's character because she will use graphic footage and try to make a story seem more scary to the public than it is in order to keep her job at the news station where she works. Perhaps it's some kind of commentary on how the working world is today. People don't have job security like they used to, and people have to work hard in a cutthroat world. It all really works and is well thought out.Now one big issue I had was with the soundtrack. Now, during some moments it works and has a dark tone, but in other moments it doesn't work and is too upbeat feeling, such as the car crash where Bloom does a little 'fixing' to get the shot he wants. What we are seeing is very dark but the music doesn't fit, and honestly I think it does a major disservice to Gyllenhaal's passionate performance. I think it would have benefited from a more dark scoreOverall I would highly recommend this film for Gyllenhaal's performance alone. It's absolutely amazing to see. I hope to see some more great work from Dan Gilroy because this film shows he has some big potential.",7,1,4,8 November 2014
Oblivion," A Mix Of Cliché And Original That Works Out In The End
","I had heard good things about this recently, saying that it was underrated, so I decided to check it out. I don't remember any raving reviews when it came out, so the sudden praise peaked my interest. I'm glad I checked it out.The film is an interesting mix of original ideas and clichés. One minute you will be intrigued by the plot, the next you'll be saying 'oh well I kinda thought that would happen', but I think it's a film that remains more on the original side. Sure, you'll see some of you're typical Hollywood movie clichés that will make you think this film is going in a bad direction, but if you stick with it until the end, you will be pleased. This is quite a beautiful film at times. It has some mesmerizing shots that will leave you breathless. They help sell the futuristic feeling. But on the flip side, there can be some slightly boring and typical set pieces. The film kind of goes back and forth between inspired and unoriginal with it's visuals, but I think the good visuals left a bigger mark on me.Tom Cruise gives a good performance, showing that he still is capable of being great. Olga Kurylenko gives an okay performance. I read about other choices for her role and I feel like maybe one of those other actresses would have worked better, but she gets the job done.Overall, this is a film you should check out if you're a fan of sci-fi. It has lots of twists and turns and will keep you entertained for sure. It seems like it slipped under the radar a bit, which is a shame, but it's worth checking out.",8,1,1,10 June 2014
American Beauty," A Truly Great Film
","American Beauty is a film that needs to be seen. When it finishes, it will leave you in awe. It will make you feel something, that's for sure. It's just a unique and great film, and it is certainly one of my favourites. American Beauty is a film that deals with a few different themes. It deals with the idea of not being happy with who you are. It deals with the theme of wanting to be unique. It deals with a lot of things that come about through everyday suburban life. It has a plot that feels relatable but also at the same time wild and slightly removed from reality. It's a drama but is full of dark humour, and it certainly benefits the film.Kevin Spacey gives a great performance. His slightly deadpan style of acting completely fits his character, who is completely sick of his boring life and wants to change things. Wes Bentley also gives a really good performance as the weird neighbour who films everything that interests him. It's an interesting cast of characters that are extremely enjoyable to watch interact, and they all work well.The directing is also great, with some interesting dream sequences and scenes that just have a feeling that I can't quite describe. It's a combination of the great music, good sets, well written dialogue and the amazing performances that just creates a vibe that is unmistakeably there. It certainly establishes the films unique feeling. Overall, this is a must see film. It's one of my all time favourites and really will impress you. It just has to be experienced.",9,0,1,28 August 2014
Edward Scissorhands," A Creative And Frankenstein Like Story
","Edward Scissorhands is a film that benefits from Tim Burton's creative mind. People always make jokes about how Burtons films can be similar and contain extremely similar themes or even music, but I would say that this film makes it work. It's a Frankenstein-esque story that has a great fairytale feeling.I think my favorite thing about this movie is it's visual style. I love the way the neighborhood looks and feels. It's like some strange mix of fantasy, 50's and late 80's. Very unique and fun. The was Edward is designed and how he works he's unique look into the look of the neighborhood is great too. He creates art work out of hedges and gives the women and dogs haircuts. It all feels very weird and surreal. Johnny Depp is pretty interesting as Edward. He plays him almost innocent, like a little boy, and it's fun to see. Lots of humour is infused in the film, but it also has many darker or sad moments. It feels like a kids movie but also has adult content, so it's more like an adult fairytale. Winona Ryder isn't the best actress in this, but I feel like she kind of visually fits the role, and she gets the job done.This is a very unique movie, and I think based on that alone it's worth a watch. Tim Burton's style works so well in the film, and it's a joy to see.",7,1,1,21 June 2014
Divergent," Has Potential To Be Something
","I went into this open minded, and while I do think this movie establishes an interesting concept and has interesting plot points, it kind of disappointed me. I will say that it's not complete crap like some of the Hollywood films based on teen books are, so perhaps thats why I kind of want to go easy on it. It's good to see some effort being put into a film. Comparing this to say, The Hunger Games, perhaps is why I was left a little underwhelmed, because I think the first Hunger Games was not bad, and then Catching Fire ended up really impressing me. I kind of hope that since this film is the first in a series, the next will take what was interesting in this and bring it to the fore front. It certainly has potential to be a good series, but it's off to a slightly rocky start.One of the stronger aspects of this film is Shailene Woodleys performance. She is a really strong actor and the film benefits from putting someone with skill in the lead role as opposed to the usual 'pretty but terrible actress' kind of girls they usually put in these kind of roles. The rest of the performances we're okay. No real stand outs but they work for the most part. The plot is another strength that works. It's about a society where young adults are sorted into different factions based on skills and it's a very stressful process. But what's great is that it is clearly a metaphor for the modern day process of pressuring young adults into university and making them make these big choices that affect the rest of their lives. I have always found issue in the way society does this ever since I started high school, and I think it's interesting to see that concept in this film. It kind of works, and I will give it credit for handling a subject that can be quite relate-able for many young people today.Overall, the films strengths come from it's concepts and it's potential to improve in future sequels. As a person who likes film in general, I will always be positive about movies and I do hope they can smooth out the next film and make it something great. I would be really happy to see the sequel be something great, similar to how Catching Fire improved on The Hunger Games dramatically.",6,1,2,14 August 2014
Aliens," Different From The Original, But Just As Good In Its Own Ways
","'Game over, man! Game over!'I think that Aliens is a great sequel. It adds more action, sure, but it certainly keeps the horror elements. I do, however, think this movie sometimes falls into the same clichés that the first film suffers from.The movie starts off really strong. The way they continue from where we left off in Alien really works. We also get a bigger sense of the universe that these films exist in that we didn't quite get in the first. It also really builds up exactly what were going to be in for. However, there are times during the movie where it kind of feels like a cheesy action movie, which certainly hurts the film. As I mentioned before, it also follows a few of the same clichés that the first movie does. An example of that would be the whole 'we blew up the monster and we're safe!' kind of cliché. It can sometimes feel like what Alien would have been if it had instead been more of an action film than an atmospheric horror film. Sigourney Weaver once again is great in this. She gives it her best once again which is great to see. When it comes to the other performances, they can be mixed. Michael Biehn gives a sometimes good, sometimes cheesy kind of performance. And Bill Paxton gives a love it or hate it performance. I think he is fun, but I can see why he could be hated. A lot of these Marines are nothing more than cheesy action movie clichés, such as the character Vasquez, who if this film was made today would be played by Michelle Rodriguez.Overall, I think this film really works as a sequel, but still suffers from some of the issues that the first movie suffers from, which brings it down. If you've seen Alien, i'd recommend watching this too.",7,0,2,11 August 2014
The Fault in Our Stars," Surprisingly Really Good And Touching
","I know that since this movie is based on a book that is read by many teenage girls, the movie is bound to get people scoffing at it and writing it off, and I understand that. I myself expected to see some cheesy stuff that made me cringe at how hard it tries to be deep or sad. But I go into films wanting to enjoy them, and i'm not going to be an idiot and pretend like I didn't like this movie. I think a lot of people say it's bad just because lots of teenage girls like it and that means they need to bash it and shouldn't like it. It turned out to be really good, touching, and a lot less cheesy then I was expecting.Let me say that I think Shailene Woodley does a great job. She sells the role completely and seems so sweet and likable. She takes lines from the book that might, when said out loud, seem cheesy or pretentious, but she makes them sound natural. I would say that I liked Ansel Elgort in his role 93% of the time. He doesn't always sell the lines, and sometimes it makes it seem cheesy or done just to make young teen girls swoon over him. He can occasionally fall into the 'dream guy' cliché that romance films have, but I would say overall he works. You do care for him. They have great chemistry and it's so great seeing them on screen. I think they work quite well. The sad parts are handled in a good manner. I won't spoil anything, but it doesn't feel like they're doing stuff to force us to cry at the movie. The movie just falls together well and you feel like crying because it works. It makes it all feel real. Their conversations feel fairly real (aside from a few remarks from Elgorts character such as the whole 'metaphor' thing and the fear of 'oblivion). It really gets you right in the heart. While it's not a perfect movie, it's extremely enjoyable and has a lot of heart. It will make you laugh, cry, and get you thinking about love. I will say that if you're and extremely negative single person, you might not like this movie. I think having an understanding of love or a relationship helps with connecting to the film. I saw it with my girlfriend and it really kind of made me think about our relationship, in a good way. If you're gonna hate on this for being marketed to teen girls, there's no point in watching it because you've already made up your mind about it. Otherwise, go and see this film. It's really something.",8,2,5,17 June 2014
Non-Stop," Not For Anyone Who Is Expecting More Than A Fun Movie
","If you've seen Taken or Unknown, you know the kind of movie that this is going to be. And if you're okay with that, you will enjoy this. If you expect more, then prepare to be disappointed. I wanted something fun and interesting, and I got it. Liam Neeson gives a good performance playing a character whose story isn't really original, but somehow makes it pretty interesting. The story itself can be interesting too, if you let the occasional movie cliché slip by every now and then. I actually expected more cheesy scenes, but there were nowhere near as many as I thought. It will keep you guessing throughout, but I would say it is kind of possible to figure out the gist of what's going on, so don't go patting yourself on the back thinking you're a genius if you do. Also, there's not as much 'action' in this as some might want. It's more filled with tension and twists that make you think a little. I enjoyed that, and I think it works here. I also personally kind of liked the visual style. It can be plain at times, but little things like the way they display the text messages on screen I really liked. As I said before, if you're a fan of Neeson's films like Taken, check this one out and enjoy it. If you expect this to absolutely change your outlook on cinema, don't watch it. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but it's a fun popcorn flick.",7,0,1,26 May 2014
Django Unchained," One Of Tarantino's Best
","So I should start out by saying i'm not a huge fan of Tarantino. I think he's quite overrated and uses too much content from other films to create his own. However, I must say that Django Unchained is one of his best. I used to think Inglorious Basterds was his best film, but I think Django takes it for me. It's just an extremely fun movie. Sure, it's not perfect, but it's still extremely enjoyable. I've heard complaints regarding the run time, but I don't really mind. Perhaps the whole 'mining company' segment could have been removed, but overall the runtime didn't seem too lengthy. The signature Tarantino style lengthy conversations felt like they fit well in this film too, which i'm glad for, because some of his other films felt like the conversations could have been greatly shortened. This film also has a great shootout which I absolutely loved. Overall, it's extremely enjoyable, meaning that fans of Tarantino will love it, and people who might not normally like his films can have fun with it too.",8,0,2,9 March 2014
Drive," An amazing film with great style.
","When I first saw the trailer to Drive, I instantly thought of Korean cinema. Whether it was the hammer carried by Gosling, or something else, i'm not sure. The influence of foreign film is clear in Drive. The story of Drive is a very simple and perhaps overused one. A silent and reserved getaway driver who doesn't normally get involved with people starts to form a relationship with a woman and her kid, causing everything to go downhill from there. Even though this story has been told before, the way it is told in Drive makes it seem fresh. Drive also has a very 80's feeling to it. The soundtrack is not only amazing but filled with 80's influenced music. It works so well with the movie and will stick out even to people who don't pay much attention to soundtracks. I had heard a lot of good things about Drive and in the end, it lived up to it. Also, I would kill for that scorpion jacket.",9,15,23,12 February 2012
Hellboy," Cheesy But Pretty Fun
","Guillermo del Toro is known for writing some pretty cheesy scripts when it comes to English speaking movies, and this movie is no exception. It is full of cheesy lines and clichés, but it's still a lot of fun. It's a comic book movie made before todays time of constant comic book movies. The story is one that is one third original, one third cliché, and one third stuff that del Toro loves. There's Nazi's that are involved with paranormal, weird creatures, creatures with tongue like things that shoot out, and all around odd things. Del Toro loves all this stuff (for more on that, watch The Strain) and it's kinda more funny than it is serious and dramatic, but it's still fun. It's self aware at times and a lot of humour is thrown in which works.Now there's a good mix of CGI and practical effects. The practical stuff works for me, but a lot of the CGI doesn't. Granted it is 2004 and we have come a LONG way since then, but there are a few specific shots, such as Hellboy crushing a redbull can, that are absolutely terrible looking. They look incomplete at times. But I will say that for the most part it looks passable. Not amazing, but okay. The movie shines in the department of design of sets and characters. The outfits and general appearances of the people in this movie are really top notch and feel fresh. It certainly makes them fun to look at. Even the general style of filming this movie goes for is kinda unique and fun. It feels like del Toro actually had a vision for this movie, like he does with most of his films. Overall this is a movie that is pretty fun. It leans more to the popcorn flick side of things, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. It's part of the beginning of the comic book genre of movies we see today, which as a side note, i'm really damn sick of.",7,0,0,13 September 2014
Across the Universe," A Fun And Enjoyable Musical
","I haven't seen a whole lot of musicals, but obviously there are many different ways of doing it. Some include the music in a way that makes sense, some just break out into song, some are more fun while others are more serious. I think this movie is more of the fun and enjoyable type, and I like it for that. Sure, it can be cheesy, and you can nit pick little things and roll your eyes when you hear that the characters in this Beatles music themed film are named 'Jude' and 'Lucy', but if you just let those things slide, there's fun to be had.The film has a lot of unique visual qualities that make it fun to watch, such as the 'I've Just Seen A Face' sequence or the 'Strawberry Fields' sequence which both are a visual treat. Some sequences are more simple but still work well. The singing is also quite good. It gives a different and unique take on classic Beatles songs, which I enjoy even though i'm not really a big fan of the Beatles (I don't hate them, I just feel like they can be overrated. I understand their musical influence and significance, but still). There's also an interesting historical take in this film. It kind of revolves around the United States during the Vietnam war and a lot of the protests and issues involved in it. It makes for an interesting backdrop and obviously fits the music. Some may find things to disagree with politically within the film, but I personally don't think it forces any views down your throat. It shows how crappy Vietnam was, which is kind of undeniably true. Overall, it's a musical that I could recommend to fans of the Beatles and musical fans. Even people who aren't exactly into musicals can find something to enjoy within this film.",7,0,0,30 July 2014
22 Jump Street," Not Quite As Good As The First, But Funny Its Own Right
","This film constantly acknowledges the fact that it's a sequel to a movie that was kind of an unexpected success, and it uses that to essentially make the same film again. But that's the joke. The plot is essentially the same as the first one. A lot of the same things occur, but just slightly different. It does work, but I think the only problem is that the first movie does it better. This one works, but I just felt like I enjoyed the first movie better overall, but perhaps that's a matter of opinion. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have really good chemistry here. Both are very funny and the film is quite aware of their chemistry. There's a gag throughout the whole film that is essentially that it treats their relationship as police officers and partners as a real relationship. There's scenes that you would see in a romance film but are played for laughs because they are between Tatum and Hill. These work well because of the chemistry and it's quite funny. As mentioned before, the movie is quite self aware about how it's just a rehash of the first movie, and they make it work. Also an end credits sequence essentially seals the deal with this whole running joke.If I had to give a complaint, it would be that perhaps the very middle part of the film was a little lacking in jokes. Not the entire middle of the movie, but some of it. It opens strong and ends pretty strong, but that middle area just kinda goes along without a whole lot. There's jokes here and there but they are gut bustlingly funny as the rest of the movie. But I would say that specific middle area of the film is only like 15% of the movie, so if that's the amount of the movie that isn't that funny, it's doing pretty good.Overall, I would recommend going to see this if you want some laughs. There's a lot of self aware humour and it made me laugh quite a bit. Though it wasn't quite as good as some critics have been saying. I heard really high praise about this movie and some super high scores, which I don't 100% agree with. It's good, but not completely amazing. It has its flaws. I will say it's super funny and if you want a good comedy movie, you should watch it.",7,4,10,24 June 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," Finally A Fresh Comic Book Film
","I for one am sick of the superhero genre dominating the modern day box office and Hollywood. I don't want to see 9 different superhero films with the same kind of plot just to see 2 films where all the characters come together in a plot that is no different than all the other films before it. I don't give a damn about 'phase 2' or whatever. Just stop. Cranking out these movies just for the sake of having more cross overs and sequels is ridiculous. While I can't deny that the main plot of Guardians Of The Galaxy doesn't stray far from all of the other comic book movies its tied to, it's approach feels much fresher, and I can't say how much I appreciate that.There was a lot of things I liked. The mixtape soundtrack was really cool. I also enjoyed all the main characters and their interactions, especially when the lead to some emotional moments throughout. The visuals are also very vivid and creative. The whole design of the galaxy and its people should be appreciated. But I do acknowledge issues. The aforementioned typical comic book plot and finale. The action sequences leave a lot to be desired to be honest. But I think issues like this could be fixed in a future sequel.I still dislike the idea of more silly comic books films and crossovers, but at least this film was unique enough to make me look forward to the sequel to this and even any future cross over films involving the Guardians. It's a fun popcorn flick. Check it out.",8,0,3,27 December 2014
Evil Dead," A Scary As Hell And Good Remake
","Generally when you hear 'remake', you shudder. But this time, don't worry. This film take the original 'The Evil Dead' and gives it a more serious and dark tone to it. They change a few things around, such as the reason for them going to the cabin being an attempt to get their friend off of drugs as opposed to just a weekend at a cabin. What I love is that they kept the practical effects of the original film. This makes for some absolutely amazing gore effects. Some of the best I've seen in a modern movie as of lately. There's no shortage of blood here, that's for damn sure. Fans of the original should enjoy this new take on the film, and should enjoy themselves while watching this terrifically frightening and gore filled film.",8,0,3,16 January 2014
The Evil Dead," A Brutal And Scary Cult Classic
","The Evil Dead has become a cult classic since its release, and I totally understand why. It's a film that is chock full of blood, guts, and screams. Did I mention blood and guts? Its a low budget film, but this only adds to the film, in my opinion. The usage of practical effects is truly amazing and is something that I kind of wish would still be used today in some areas. There are also a lot of interesting shots such as the fast moving shots through the forest, which are fun to watch. Acting wise, it's not strong, but Bruce Campbell gives a fun performance. It's a must watch for horror fans, and for anyone who wants to have a good time and some fun scares.",7,1,3,10 January 2014
Prisoners," Twists, Turns, And Mazes
","Two little girls are kidnapped. An RV is seen nearby. Police begin to investigate, but this is not a simple case. The characters all feel extremely well established and real, such as Gyllenhaals' characters tattoos and eye twitching or Hugh Jackmans' characters religious tendencies and preparation for some kind of disastrous event. The movie is 2 and a half hours long, and I would say it benefits from it. It allows the plot to unfold at a good pace. It never feels rushed. This film will always have you guessing who is behind the kidnappings and how the film will play out, which is a good trait for a thriller/mystery movie. It also wraps the story up fairly well. Overall, it's a memorable thriller film which should be seen if you're a fan of the genre.",8,1,2,14 November 2013
Les Misérables," This Movie Made Me Miserable
","Oh god. Let me start out by saying that I have seen what people seem to say is the best version of the stage production on DVD, but I have not read the original book, so I am essentially speaking about the musical. I personally extremely dislike the story of Les Mis. First off, the book looks like its longer than the bible, so the idea that you can cram all that into a 2 hour and 30 minute movie or a 3 or 4 hour stage musical is crazy. With both the film and stage version, the plot of Les Mis is all over the place. First its about a man who stole a loaf of bread for his sister and was arrested, but then he is release and he steals some stuff. Forget the sister, cause we gotta cut to 8 years later with no info on anything in between! Now he's a mayor. He feels bad for a woman who he kind of was mean to and now he is taking care of her kid. BOOM MORE YEARS LATER! Suddenly we are focusing on a revolution and the character drama becomes more of a side plot. We also don't get any explanation for the revolution except 'we're poor and we don't like rich people so lets make a wall out of chairs and kill soldiers', which is not good for people who have little knowledge of the French revolution. The movie seems to have so much to deal with that it just decides to fly around like a drunk bird hoping we get the idea. I'm sorry, but under the assumption that the book is better, the film and stage versions of Les Mis are a complete mess plot wise. Lets talk about the music, seeing as it is a musical. One issue I have is that although I kind of like musicals, I find it hard to take seriously a musical that is singing about a serious subject matter. It feels odd when you sing about someone dying. Musical like Grease or The Producers allow you to have fun with the songs. This movie uses the music to make you feel...miserable. All of the singing was done live on set, and it shows. While this style of filming greatly benefits the actors ability to give strong acting performances, it can make their singing take a serious hit. I felt that Anne Hathaway and Samantha Barks were the only too that let their emotions in their acting also benefit their singing and make both work. Occasionally Hugh Jackman did, but I feel like he sings kind of strange. Russel Crowe is good in certain moments, but can also be fairly monotone, which I understand is kind of the style of singing for that character, but still. In the end it feel that live singing while acting doesn't work for everyone.A big plus in this film is its costumes and some of the sets. The costumes look very good and even the makeup and hair, except for Eddie Redmayne's character who seems to have some kind of hair gel, which they do because he's supposed to be the heartthrob for young girls (except he looks more like a frog with spikey hair). The sets can sometime feel quite real and well done, but other times feel fake and very set like, or even use too much CGI and feel unreal.In the end, this film just doesn't work. It feels rushed and is so bloated with plot that it feels like it goes on and on and on. Also, I have never hear so many English accents in France. I understand that this happens in Hollywood films where they take place in Europe, but it really just seems insulting when the film is so heavily about France and the FRENCH people. I wouldn't recommend this film. Go see a fun musical, because you will be quite happy that you did instead of watching this.",5,1,2,4 August 2014
The Untouchables," A Solid Movie
","I remember I first saw this movie in a history class in high school because we were learning about the prohibition, and I think it's a film that really sells the struggle between the police and the criminals during the prohibition, specifically the famous Al Capone. Also, while it doesn't follow history 100% accurately, it helped me visualize the story I was learning at the time and gives you a general idea how things went down.Kevin Costner gives a fairly good performance as Elliot Ness. He shines in any scenes where emotions are high and everything becomes serious. Robert De Niro plays Al Capone, and I kind of wish they showed more of him, because I enjoyed watching him, especially in the end courtroom scene. It just felt like he was giving a good performance that couldn't be 100% enjoyed because he wasn't present enough.The film includes quite a few classic scenes and quotes that are extremely memorable. It's an entertaining and interesting film that perhaps shows a bit of age when watching it now, but it can still be thoroughly enjoyed.",8,0,0,15 June 2014
Jersey Boys," Eastwood Goes Scorsese
","Jersey Boys is a movie that, if it didn't exist, the film world would not be any different. BUT, that's not to say it isn't good. It works and is good, but doesn't have quite enough to propel it into 'amazing' territory.This film feels very much like a Martin Scorsese movie. The fast pace, the narration, the angry wife, it all feels like Goodfellas or The Wolf Of Wallstreet. I mean, Joe Pesci is even in this! (As a character, not the actual actor. And with a great reference to Goodfellas, I must say) While I would say Eastwood does this style well, I think it would have been more interesting to see Scorsese direct it. I think this film would have been amazing with Scorsese behind the wheel, but it just gets the job done with Eastwood. I think that sums up the movie well. Gets the job done, but doesn't blow you away.The performances were interesting. I thought John Lloyd Young did a good job as Frankie. I think the scenes where he shined were when he was on stage or just being Frankie in his day to day stuff, but when a more emotionally intense scene came along, I felt like sometimes he fell a little short. Over all he did well, especially with the singing. I thought the other guys in the Four Seasons did a good job too, especially Vincent Piazza. They were all believable and felt real. I don't know enough about the actual guys, so I can't say if they were portrayed properly.The sets and costumes and what not were quite good. They all were enjoyable to look at and rarely did you feel like you were seeing a modern film, aside from a scene or two where they're in a car and the backdrop looks pretty cheesy. (Which I feel like might have been on purpose as an homage to older films.) The whole film has a realistic vibe to it that may have to do with Eastwood being in his 80's meaning he was around for all of this stuff. I think his age helps the film for sure.In the end, I enjoyed the movie, enjoyed the music, and had a good time. Would I HIGHLY recommend this film? No. But I don't think it will disappoint. (Perhaps unless you have seen the actual musical, which I haven't seen but i've heard is really great)",7,0,3,8 July 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," This Is What The Hollywood Blockbuster Should Be
","In my eyes, Edge Of Tomorrow is an example of what a Hollywood blockbuster should be. It can be fun and full of action, but it also has an interesting plot that makes you think a little bit, and the acting is really good. This movie shows that just because there's action in the script, doesn't mean that all you include is big explosions in order to pull people into seeing it.This movie has a simple premise. A man ends up obtaining the power to reset the day when he dies, giving him the chance to save the world from invading aliens. Yes, similar to Groundhog Day, but it's really well done. They establish certain events happening within this single day, allowing them to do some creative and often hilarious things when we first see Cruise' character relive those events. He will say things to people before they even say it themselves, try to save people in battle, and even train in order to become a better fighter. It also embraces a lot of humour, in one scene showing Cruise with epic music trying to learn from his mistakes, but constantly getting killed in slightly embarrassing ways, cutting the music, and then cutting back to the same scene but where he does it properly, the music starting up again. It made me laugh out loud many times. The film also occasionally has Cruise say things like 'we tried to do that before and it didn't work', implying that he had experienced many failed attempts before that we as an audience didn't need to see but we now know. It's really smart about how much failure it shows us versus how much of his progression we see. There are a few twists and turns here that help make the plot more interesting as well. Also, a lot of people complain about the ending, but I think it works perfectly because of all we have been through with the characters.The acting is really good. Tom Cruise starts off as a wimpy guy who really doesn't want to fight and doesn't seem like a hero. But as the film goes along, he becomes braver and more heroic, making you like him more and more. Emily Blunt is also extremely good. What I love about her character is that she is really bad-ass and strong, BUT it isn't done in a ham-fisted, 'girls can be tough too' kind of way. She is a tough character that just happens to be a girl, and that's what modern movies need. Enough of those silly characters that try so hard to empower women that they seem laughable. Give us REAL strong and tough girl characters like this, and women will feel empower for real! There is also a bit of a love plot going on with Cruise and Blunts' characters, BUT it doesn't over take the film and doesn't feel unnecessary. Perhaps my only complaint is that while the CGI is good and there can be some interesting things to look at, the movie has a bit of the typical Hollywood boring cinematography. Comparing this to Oblivion, another beautiful Tom Cruise sci-fi film that came out recently, it just feels slightly uninspired at time. But it does get the job done and has some really cool action sequences, like the caravan alien chase and a lot of the beach invasion scenes. Overall I would highly recommend this film to anyone who likes sci- fi, action, or anyone who wants to watch a good film that you will have fun with. It's highly enjoyable, well done, and easily accessible. It's exactly what a big budget Hollywood movie should be.",8,9,17,28 September 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Scorsese Does It Again
","Sex, drugs, money. This film contains lots and lots of all three of those things. Some may say that the amount of it is gratuitous and unnecessary, but I think that's the point. These Wall Street guys had these things in excess, so why shy away from that? Scorsese directs this similarly to Goodfellas or Casino, but in a way that seems more fast paced and wild. It almost seems surprising that a an older director such as Scorsese could direct a film that seems so fast and full of youth, but he does it. The film is three hours long, but I enjoyed every minute of it. It's hilarious, shocking, entertaining, dramatic and overall, amazing. Don't miss this film.",9,1,8,5 January 2014
Prometheus," A Great Sci-fi World That Builds Up A Universe
","As somebody who has seen Alien and Aliens, and liked them but wasn't crazy about them, I can say that I actually think Prometheus was pretty good. It got a lot of hate from Alien series fans, but I don't see why. Is it because it's only loosely related to the franchise? Who knows. All I can say is that it's a good sci-fi film.In theory, it's kind of the same story we have seen in not only other sci-fi films, but the other Alien films. That being said, the way it's executed in Prometheus works. It adds it's own flair to already existing ideas in the sci-fi genre. I also found the plot and it's themes to be quite clear, where as I have heard a lot of people complain that it makes no sense. I really don't understand that complaint. Yeah, not EVERYTHING is explained, but it doesn't need to be. The main ideas were explained, and that's whats important. It's also heavy on themes of faith and creation, and I liked the way it explored these themes. I also must say I really loved the very last scene that connects it to Alien. I won't spoil it, but it's really awesome to see.I do hope there is some kind of sequel or continuation. It builds on the world of the Alien franchise, and I find it fascinating. I personally can sometimes find the lore of a sci-fi film or series to be too much, but I really like what they were going for here, and want to see more.",8,3,6,5 January 2015
Unbroken," Perhaps Just Stick With The Book
","Unbroken is a mixed bag. On one hand, it feels like extreme Oscar- bait and over done, but on the other, it feels like it shows potential in Angelina Jolies' directing skills and I don't think it should be completely torn apart like a lot of people are doing.I think the strongest thing about this is the general story. It's based on a true story, and it really is incredible. Much respect to the actual men who went through this, because it obviously takes a strong person to get through it. Obviously this is the theme of the film. Staying strong through tough times and being 'unbroken' so to speak. But sadly a good performance from Jack O'Connell and some occasionally nice cinematography and directing by Jolie isn't enough. The film tries way to hard to be that film that makes you cry because the character is so strong and the whole time you feel the film saying 'give me an Oscar! Look! Emotion! Hardships!' instead of straight up showing you a situation that a strong man got through, and that's its biggest issue. In that sense, films like Rescue Dawn do it much better. This feels to artificial and tries too hard. Not much in the film itself got an emotional response, EXCEPT for the final words before the credits, that actually show the real Louis Zamperini, running the Olympic torch in Japan. It's such a strong image to see and almost brought a tear to my eye. But I guess that shows it might have been better as a documentary of sorts.There was also some odd moments throughout. Zamperini and two other men find themselves floating out at sea, and in a really great scene at night we see sharks surrounding them. This builds tension extremely well, but I found it ruined when it climaxes with a kind of laughable jump scare where the shark jumps out at a character. It could have been done smoother, and the theater I was in laughed at it. In fact, they laughed at a lot of stuff. While I do think it was partially to do with the younger age of the people in the theater, I think a better film wouldn't have had them laughing. The character of Watanabe is supposed to be a terrifying Japanese internment camp leader, but occasionally comes across as weird of laughable. I guess that sums up a lot of sequences. Could have been really moving or shocking, but kind of came across as weird.In the end, I thought it was okay. The runtime of 2 hours and 17 minutes feels more like 3 hours and 17 minutes because of some dragging, but I'm glad I learned about Zamperini and his story, because it's worth hearing. Jolie shows potential to be a good director, but doesn't quite hit the mark, and O'Connel gives a strong performance. It's worth a watch, just to see for yourself, but perhaps just reading the book is a better choice.",6,1,4,4 January 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," A Total Surprise Of A Film
","So, for a long time, I avoided The Hunger Games. I had seen and loved Battle Royale, and I felt like The Hunger Games would be a more PG version of that. But I decided to watch the first film, and I was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed it. But this one is even better. I walked out of this film really pleased. It does have similarities to the first film, but I think this one does everything better. It has a lot of really interesting twist and turns to the story to keep me wanting to know what happens. The film ends in a way that really leaves you wanting to see the next film so you can find out how the rest of it plays out. I would say this film can appeal to both men and women, with it's mix of action, drama, and romance, and that works to it's advantage. If you enjoyed the first movie, you will love this one. This is how blockbuster movies should be made. Entertaining, but done in a way that feels like effort has been made.",8,51,111,7 January 2014
Godzilla," Godzilla Is A Great Summer Blockbuster
","I went into this film as a summer blockbuster and I will be reviewing it in that mindset too. I'm a fan of big monster movies that are done well. They give me a feeling that other movies don't. I really get sucked in and I love that kind of atmosphere. I think this film reminded me the most of Cloverfield. The monster designs had that kind of feeling to it, and it had a nice build-up to the monster reveal that is amazing. I won't spoil it, but the reveal of Godzilla gave me chills. The build-up really works. The whole film has a lot of build-up and suspense to it that really is great. Many scenes with the monsters are shot at night, but it is done quite well and you can see the monsters well, allowing the darkness to cover up anything that may look unrealistic in a day time scene. The score is also quite nice, and fits well with the the events that are occurring for the most part. I think an issue comes in with the concept of making it very heavily focused on character drama. I love that idea in theory, but it just doesn't come together in this as well as I would have liked it to. Aaron Taylor-Johnson isn't the greatest actor in my opinion, and it doesn't work having him as the lead. He gets the job done but it just could have been much better. Bryan Cranston gives a fairly good performance, but I can't help but feel like he wasn't 100% suited to the role, and maybe he was cast in that role just to bring in more people, since Breaking Bad was huge. Not that he doesn't do a good job, it just felt like something was missing at times. Also the movie felt a tad bit cheesier than it should have been at times. It takes a more realistic approach to the whole Godzilla idea but still includes silly stuff, but I think that's just the whole Hollywood blockbuster thing. I went into this wanting some fun and monster scenes that would give me chills, and it delivered. Godzilla is a really great summer film.",8,9,18,17 May 2014
Cloud Atlas," Ambitious And Incredible
","Cloud Atlas is one of the most ambitious films I have ever seen. 30 minutes into the almost 3 hour film, I began to think that perhaps it was too bloated and all over the place to actually achieve what it set out to do, but a few minutes after that 30 minute mark the film started to prove itself to me, up until the very end when I had been completely won over. Cloud Atlas is not one story, but 6 stories. What's even more interesting is that almost every actor in this film plays a different character in each storyline. Sometimes you don't even recognize them because of mass amounts of makeup and prosthetics, or sometimes they will play a tiny role in one storyline but a main role in another one. The story lines do not occur one after the other like an anthology film, but simultaneously. We bounce back and forth between them because they are all interconnected in a way. Why? Because the main themes of the film involve past lives and karma. It also looks at other themes, such as love. It's jam packed, even for a 3 hour film, but it most certainly pulls it all off.I would say that I enjoyed every actors performance. Sure, some are a little cheesy at times, but a lot of that is actually played off as comedy. Tom Hanks is great. Jim Sturgess is wonderful. Halle Berry is terrific. As I said, everyone is great. There's also a lot of unique style to each individual story. Some are more action packed and dazzling in their visuals, such as the Neo Seoul story, where as some are more simply beautiful and touching, such as the story of two gay lovers separated in 1936, which is a story that touched me and I would have loved to have seen as a full length film. In fact, all of these stories could have worked on their own, but in a way they work even better all in one story. When you see just how one story connected with the other, it's really satisfying and often emotional. I would highly recommend this. It's not gonna be everyone's cup of tea, but it's so incredibly ambitious that it deserves to be seen. I really loved it and was taken by surprise just how well done it was.",9,1,3,6 January 2015
Inside Llewyn Davis," A Different Kind Of Film
","When I first saw the trailer to this, I didn't really have any urge to rush out and see it. It just didn't seem like a movie I would enjoy. But over time I kind of gained an interest in checking it out, and I'm glad I finally did. It's different for sure, but interesting, and there's a lot there.The whole movie is extremely aimless and roams around, just like the main character it follows. Llewyn Davis kind of roams around himself, sleeping on couches and just taking it a day at a time. He doesn't exactly have a specific goal in this film, lie most films would. It also doesn't really wrap the whole thing up at the end. But it's not exactly about that. It's about the journey he goes on and what he learns. I thought the whole cat situation he gets involved in was interesting, and there's a lot to look into regarding that ('Llewyn is the cat'). There's also a weird connection between the first few minutes of the film and the last few minutes, where it almost feels like some kind of time loop. I think due to the nature of some of the discussions in the film about Llewyn just not trying to change and letting things happen to him again and again, I think the loop worked. It may confuse some, but I think it is really neat. I'm sure on a second viewing I would pick up on more.The performances were great. Oscar Isaac is really captivating as Llewyn. I found myself interested in whatever he was doing, not matter how simple, and that's extremely important in a film like this where the plot is so aimless. There are also performances by Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake and even Adam Driver that are great (also that other guy from Girls appears which is kind of funny). I also really enjoyed the music. While it's not the kind of music I would listen to normally, it's really well done and great to listen to.Overall I think this is a unique film that's worth a watch. It does a lot of subtle and interesting things that keep you interested throughout, and it's a movie that would benefit from a second watch.",8,0,2,28 June 2014
Her," Emotional And Touching
","I saw the trailer to this and instantly wanted to watch it. I loved the concept and thought it looked great. I finally sat down to watch it, and wow. I feel like this film contains so many great ideas that I don't even know where to start with this review. The film really has a good understanding of human emotions and the feelings involved in relationships and really explores these ideas. The film is not focused on the pro/cons of having an OS as a girlfriend, but just more of the idea of a relationship. The film can be quite emotionally hard hitting at times, and depending on your mood, can be seen as depressing or uplifting. It also contains an extremely well done and interesting 'sex scene' (which I won't spoil) that in theory should be hilarious, but turns out to be touching. It's a really unique film, and is hard to compare to anything else. I would just recommend checking this out. It's creative and new, and really is a moving film.",9,0,0,29 April 2014
Goodfellas," A Total Classic
","Let me just say that while I don't think this is a perfect film, it's a total classic. Do I think that sometimes it's a bit overrated because a lot of film critics or film teachers claim it's perfect? Yeah, but do I enjoy it? Yeah I do. I also think it deserves a lot of credit, because it does a whole lot of great things. This film is a big sprawling story, following a gangster over the many years of his life. You really feel like you've witnessed his life once you reach the end of the film. The film is very fast paced and can quickly give you lots of information in a short amount of time, and I think it does it well. However I feel that Scorsese's later films such as Casino or The Wolf Of Wallstreet have this same style, but do it better. But Goodfellas should still be respected.There are tons of great performances here. Everyone does a great job and just feels natural. It has an almost documentary feeling because everyone just seems like they aren't acting, but just living their lives. It really helps strengthen the film.To me, it's not a perfect film, but it's a movie that should be seen, especially if you're a fan of films or a film maker. It's a classic and deserves to be respected.",8,0,1,16 June 2014
Evil Dead II," A Great Follow Up To The First Film
","Evil Dead 2 is a follow up to the first film, but at times feels like a slight retelling due to the recap of the first film not being exactly how it happened originally (due to them not being able to obtain the rights to use footage from the first film). The horror is still there, but this time with a good amount of humor infused too. I feel that the humor did work and makes the film a lot of fun, even though personally I wasn't falling out of my seat laughing. Bruce Campbell's performance is much cheesier in this one, but it makes you love his character. I actually think I enjoyed this film more than the first. While the first is a great horror movie, this one is just so much fun.",8,1,2,10 January 2014
Furious 7," Big, dumb and bloated but still very enjoyable
","Furious 7 is essentially The Raid 2 but with cars. It's big and globe trotting, feeling like a crazy Bond film. It's also pretty stupid. but I will say it seems aware of that... half of the time. It's not my favorite of the series, but it's certainly the biggest, and it can be quite a bit of fun.The two big flaws here are excess and stupidity. The film is 2 hours and 17 minutes, and it really feels long. As much as I love action, this film is like 92% action scenes, and with a film this length, you need to pad it a bit. Here's an example. The Raid Redemption was almost all action, but it was 90 minutes. When it's sequel turned out to be around 2 and a half hours, they padded it with drama scenes. Here, it can feel a bit like a punch to the skull for its whole run time, making you feel numb from the action and taking away from it. It seems like every 10 seconds there's a punch, slam, boom, or crash. There's guns, cars, explosions, the whole works. When there's too much, it's sensory overload and it all becomes one big ball of loud. It does contain some of the most ambitious action sequences in the whole series, and they are just insane. Cars with parachutes, cars going out windows, you name it. They are pretty well done, with a nice mix of practical and CGI. I did take issue with the way it was shot, as it could be quite shaky and fast paced, and it sometimes moves faster than your brain can process. A highlight for me was a fist fight involving Tony Jaa (who I am glad they didn't put to waste) that is just crazy. There's a scene that has a door going down a flight of stairs with the two fighters on it, and it amazed me, which is very difficult considering the mass amount of action films I have scene. When you can show me something new, I gotta give credit.I'm sure a lot of people are wondering about the CGI Paul Walker, and I have to say they did a very good job. As someone who has seen a lot of CGI stuff, I could kind of tell when something was off, but it still had me unsure whether I was seeing really good CGI or the real Paul. The person I saw it with said she didn't notice it at all, so I guess that means that the general public won't notice a thing. It's difficult to make a human face look real with CGI, but they do a damn fine job. On that same note, there's a very touching Paul Walker tribute at the end that is tasteful and really well done. It was heart warming to see and they couldn't have done it better.As I said, the film is kind of stupid. Yeah, the past entries haven't been smart, but they have certainly progressed further and further out of reality, and at this point it might as well be sci fi. There's clichés and stuff that just couldn't happen at all. Unfortunately, it's only self aware what feels like half of the time. It can crack a joke at itself, but other times it just feels cheesy. There's also things like Tyrese Gibsons' character, who they over use. He plays the comic relief, and it works at the right time, but when it feels like every scene includes a quip from him, you just wanna strangle the guy. There's also so many people in here, coming and going, cameos and bigger roles, you name it. Characters from past films in the series pop up for a scene, new actors are brought in as new characters, some of which more substantial than others, such as Kurt Russel being an important character, but Tony Jaa being a henchman. Iggy Azalea even pops up for like 5 seconds. That had me scratching my head a little.Overall, fans will almost certainly enjoy it. I'm a fan of the series, and I know it's not high art, but I like to have some mindless fun. This film kind of feels like Transformers in that regard, with it's sensory overload of action and long run time, which is probably its biggest downfall for me in all honesty, but there's a lot to like here, and it gives a lot of fan service. My favorite is still Fast Five followed by the first one, but this is a big step above the disappointing 6th film.",8,0,4,13 May 2015
