3:10 to Yuma," Better than Unforgiven. A true classic (spoiler free movie review)
","I watched this movie on the suggestion of a friend before reading the vile and vitriol filled comments about it here on IMDb. And boy , did I like it. It was an amazing movie to say the least. Completely actioned packed and amazingly emotional. More than you can ask from a western.In fact I think this is the best western I've ever seen, and I rate it ahead of The Good, The Bad and the Ugly and Unforgiven. Don't get me wrong... the above two movies were beautiful. but the former one was a bit too long for my taste and I couldn't connect to the characters in it as much as I did here while the later didn't have much action to make it a real classic. While 3:10 to Yuma has all the ingredients to make it a classic. The haters mainly contend that this movie has too many corny and unbelievable elements. Well, yeah, you might die after taking that first gunshot in real life, but in movies there's always that chance that you survive and live to walk the next day. That's what makes it a movie. I mean, Isn't the number one ranked movie Shawshank redemption (also one of my favourites) based on impossible events too?. So are almost all other movies. So haters, get real, we're talking about movies here. Also many of the points they address are pretty lame, but I am not going to speak of it here, as I want to keep this review, spoiler free.Movies are made to be enjoyed not to reflect real life. If you want that, then go and watch some documentaries for heaven's sake. Also I think as much as this movie is concerned, because of the initial pre and post release hype it was getting, some people just have taken it as a personal crusade to bad-mouth this movie and are waging a personal vendetta against it. Maybe this movie is just too good for them. So, please don't let the haters spoil this movie for you. This movie succeeds in every level that a movie should succeed in: acting although not brilliant is certainly not slacky and is praise worthy (although Russel Crowe didn't reach gladiator level's of perfection in my eye, Christian Bale, Logan Lerman and Ben Foster where more than amazing), the action sequences were incredible throughout and the imagery was excellent, overall the direction was pretty good, but more than anything I felt this movie was able to connect with me, the audience. And despite what the naysayers tell, I absolutely loved the ending. I thought it was what the movie deserved, as it shows that we can all be heroes, no matter what. So, all said and done, go and watch it. This might indeed be the best western you will ever see.",9,0,2,26 December 2011
Full Metal Jacket," Watch this movie if only for the first half !!!
","My ratings table: stars can be deciphered as:- 1/2 * = you might have to kill yourself after watching this. * = utilize your time watching paint dry instead * 1/2 = bad/boring run-of-the-mill movie, avoid if possible couple** = just your ordinary run-of-the-mill movie with a couple of decent moments.... ** 1/2 = decent movie, watch if time permits*** = overall good package, could improve though*** 1/2 = good movie with stand-out talking points. **** = must see, excellent movie!**** 1/2 = cinema par excellence, one of the all time greats***** = the perfect movie/ as close to perfect as a movie can getFull Metal Jacket (1987)Rating: **** 1/2The movie completely blew me away. I'd recommend this to one and all. as the subject matter is one that every person should think about. This is an amazing movie, that shows what war really is: nothing but a waste of life. 'The dead know only one thing - it is better to be alive.' But what makes this movie more special is the first half or perhaps the first 40 minutes of the movie: it's possibly right up there with the best starts ever seen in a movie, all time... perhaps THE best. Yes, I think the film did lose some steam thereafter but the ending more than made up for it. If you haven't watched this yet... go and do so... and acquaint yourself with seemingly heartless Captain Hartley and the agony, amusement and laughs only he can dish out simultaneously to the audiences.. Also at the risk of repeating myself , I'd like to echo in with the other thousands of sentiments raised by people here: Kubrick really is a genius and this movie tells us why.",6,0,2,18 December 2011
Les Mis√©rables," Just one word: EPIC
","I don't usually write reviews, but then again, I never really watch movies adhering to these two criteria: recent and EPIC. Yes, I haven no qualms in admitting outright and unabashedly that this has been one of the best movie going experiences for me. (And this is coming from someone who has seen most of the movies here on the IMDb top 250 list). Going into the movie I had no idea of what it was, but since the first scene (which was amazing, and when I realized that Russel Crowe, one of my favorite actors was in it) it had me hooked right up until the last and this is really something considering the GIGANTIC duration of the movie compared to what we get these days. And it even made me shed a few tears right in the end and it was around this time when I was completely sure that this movie was going down as one of the all time classics I'll ever see in my life. I've never really had much of a taste for musicals (having turned off half way through Sweeney Todd), but this was something else completely. Intelligent writing and epic settings and the entire story was brilliant. I'm not familiar with the original piece of literature but I am quite sure that it must have been a helluva of a creation by Victor Hugo if this is what it's celluloid representation looks like. I'm pretty sure whatever money went into the making of this movie (and it must have been a LOT considering on how it turned out) was well used. Hugh Jackman was inspirational in this. Russell Crowe, although I felt was somewhat of a disappointment (in that he (in my eyes) fell short in displaying the cruel, ruthless and duty bound leader Javert) still speaks volumes.. I mean, how can a movie be bad when it's weakest character is still ten times better and more identifiable than the strongest characters we get in your average run of the mill movies these days?. As for Anne Hathaway's character, she was a revelation... she completely justified her role and was absolutely perfect, I have no doubt that this was the best performance of her career. Also, I can't leave without speaking about another guy in the movie.... Imagine my surprise when halfway through it, one my favorite comedy artist turned up.. yeah, that's right... it's Sacha Baron Cohen, and boy did he live up to his expectations, he and Helena completely provided the comedic relief necessary in this EPIC venture. I really loved how all the other actors too played their parts. I have nothing but praise for the director and the producers, clearly it was a job well done on the part of the whole team, seeing as how this turned out. All in all I LOVED this movie and will definitely watch it again and again!. 10/10. Recommended.",10,7,12,24 January 2013
