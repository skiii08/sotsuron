Walk the Line," Great Movie
","Truly the best movie of '05 that I have seen. Reese and Joaquin are Johnny and June to perfection. I (being a Johnny Cash fan) was worried that Joaquin wouldn't be able to pull off the singing, but he was superb when singing (although you can tell it is his voice and not Johnny Cash's)! I also loved the fact that the director pulled no punches, he simply showed us who Johnny Cash was, which at times, he was a bad husband and father, and a drug user. The screenplay was great, relying on dialogue rather than visuals or Johnny Cash's music. The dialogue was excellent between Johnny and June.I give this movie 4 stars, a must see.
