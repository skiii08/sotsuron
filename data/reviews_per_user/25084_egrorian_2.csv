Spartacus," Kirk Douglas' movie
","I realise it is the norm to refer to a film as the director's 'baby' as in 'Ridley Scott's 'Alien''.  However, to refer to 'Stanley Kubrick's 'Spartacus'' I find ridiculous.  Clearly, it is Kirk Douglas' movie through and through and he employed Kubrick for his undoubted skills as a filmmaker. Not withstanding Kubrick devotees, 'Spartacus' will be remembered as Kirk Douglas' movie and (IMHO) rightly so.Outstanding performances abound - Douglas, Olivier, Laughton  and Ustinov are all outstanding - whilst, as comparisons with 'Ben-Hur' are often made, perhaps shares its only weakness with the other great epic in that the love story elements are a little mushy today.  However, the romance between Spartacus and Varinia is more engaging than that of Judah Ben-Hur and Esther.  For Antoninus to proclaim his love for Spartacus - having just been terminally wounded by him - was rather cringe-worthy it must be said.Pushed to it, I still prefer 'Ben-Hur' and the somewhat maligned 'El Cid' but 'Spartacus' remains a classic.I liked 'Gladiator' very much too - and while it is not a competition - I do think 'Spartacus' is the better movie.",Null,1,2,22 April 2003
Driven," Very enjoyable!
","Okay, it might not be high brow stuff or very realistic but a very enjoyable 'fun' movie. It was nice that there was no bad guy, or have Stallone's character as the ageing racer who comes back to win the World Title (not very believable!).   Looking at some comments for Driven and for other Sly movies on the IMDB it seems to me that many folks just have a downer on Stallone and trash everything he does due to their own prejudices.  If you dislike him then why watch his films?  'The Worst movie ever made'?  Give me a break.",Null,0,1,11 April 2004
