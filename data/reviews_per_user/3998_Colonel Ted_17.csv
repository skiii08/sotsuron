The Blair Witch Project," What is all the fuss about?
","I had heard loads about this film and to be honest this is yet another that that has simply failed to live up to all the hype. Full marks to the writers/directors for originality. It certainly feels real, but simply isn't scary at all, only managing to be moderately suspenseful at times. It is films like this that remind me just how good Ridley Scott's 'Alien' really is. There we have a film that masterfully builds up the suspense from beginning to end. 'The Blair Witch Project' simply doesn't come close. A major disappointment and a film that suggests to me that all the critics that raved over the film and made it a must see film are really a bunch of wimps! 4/10",4,0,1,9 December 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The biggest disappointment in film history
","The first episode to the Star Wars saga was never going to live up to or surpass the hype it was given and we all knew that most of the critics would pan it. But to be honest, the negative reviews were far more accurate than any positive review I read. On the whole, it's not a bad film, but the problem is that none of the heart and soul that was poured into the other episodes is present here. Lucas had always said that this one would be just to set-up the story. Well Episode Four didn't have that problem. 'But it's the story, its the story,' Lucas kept saying. Maybe, the trouble with that it isn't a very interesting story George boy. Everything about The Phantom Menace is flat and lifeless. The writing the direction, the action and the performances. Neeson is poorly cast as Qui Gon Jin, while McGregor speaks like a public boy with a large plum in the back of his throat as Kenobi. The plot isn't as nearly as compelling as the other three films either. The Trade Federation boundaries being in dispute sound as thrilling as the as the content of European sausages. And who cares if Portman as the Queen ever signs a stupid treaty or if Terence Stamp is voted out of the Senate? True the special effects are impressive, but without the rich characterisation of the previous films, we don't really care about the outcome. The action scenes seem rushed because Lucas has lost nearly all of his sense of timing and none of them come close to the fantastic Death Star assault at the end of the 1977 film. The nadir though has to be the suggestion of the virgin birth of Anakin Skywalker... please! None of the assurance and character of the previous films is present here and the only positive feeling you have coming away from it is that, hopefully it is setting up a stronger story for the next episodes. To end on a personal note, I remember that Time Out wrote about the original film 'even if you've been entertained, you may feel cheated of something'. I hardly ever agree with Time Out, but that quote pretty much sums up my thoughts; not on Star Wars Episode IV, which was made on a mere $6 million, but on The Phantom Menace, which cost 20 times as much.",4,0,1,15 December 1999
The Mummy," A decent summer blockbuster
","Loathed by the critics, but a huge hit at the box office, this updating of the 1930's Karloff classic provides solid entertainment at the cinema. It's not as good as The Matrix (although the plot is easier to understand), but far better than The Phantom Menace, The Mummy owes more to Indiana Jones than Karloff. Fraiser plays French Legionnaire Rick O'Connell who is rescued from death by Evie (Weisz) and Jonathan (Hannah) Carnahan to help them search for the Lost City of Hamunaptra. Unfortunately they end up awakening The Mummy of the title (a CGI clad Vosloo) who naturally causes havoc. Sommers' script is rather flawed. There are a few too many jokes about smelly Arabs and for the most characterisation and a bumpy romance between Fraiser and Weiez has been sacrificed to the action. This is certainly no Lawrence of Arabia as well, as there is a distinct lack of atmosphere to the film. Hannah is badly cast as Evie's work shy brother. Although he does get quite a few laughs, he is never convincing as a stuck up toff. Frasier is charismatic enough to carry the film and makes a good hero, although he's not a patch on Harrison Ford. However any flaws are more than compensated by the action which is superb, thrilling and spectacular as Sommers piles on the effects, the explosions, and the fights. These include a sandstorm, thousands of bugs, a recreation of Plagues of Egypt, plus the CGI Mummy itself. It you check you brain at the door, then The Mummy is good harmless fun.",7,0,0,9 February 2000
Alien," An object exercise in visceral terror
","After 20 years, this is still the scariest and most suspenseful film I have ever seen. I was left rather in the cold after seeing James Cameron's sequel, Aliens, which is still very good, but can't hold a candle to Ridley Scott's classic in terms of shear terror. Some people complain that Alien is slow and thinking about it the pace of the actual script is leisurely. Yet from the start Scott creates an atmosphere that you can cut with a knife and moves the film along so that two hours pass by all too quickly. Its basically a haunted house in space as Scott preys on everyone's primal fears about the bogey man fear of the dark... and takes them too their extremes. Production values art direction, SFX, Jerry Goldsmith's score and performances from Weaver especially but also from British stars Ian Holm and John Hurt (Until he gets serious tummy trouble) is impeccable. The famous scene when the alien bursts out of his stomach still makes me feel queasy and this is an objective exercise in understated direction and the fear of the unknown (you don't see the creature until the very end) that is far scarier than Cameron's 1986 blast fest. A classic. 10/10!",10,0,1,14 September 1999
American Pie," The best summer film by far!
","Four teenage boys vow to lose their virginity by prom night. That's it. No spin, no Dawson's Creek irony and no Shakespearean undertones, which is partly why it works so well. The rest of it is down to a screamingly funny script with brilliant dialogue and hilarious (often gleefully tasteless) situations, but one that also gives us believable characters while also giving us quite a serious message and ultimately being quite touching by the end. All the performances are top notch with Jason Biggs in particular revelling in his character's increasingly outrageous situations from screwing an apple pie while his dad walks to premature ejeculation while the whole school tunes in on the Internet and his '50s styled Dad very well used is nothing short of a creation of comic genius. From beginning to end, this priceless gem scores all hits and no misses, but it's Alyson Hannigan, as the geeky flute player, who with one line, steals the entire film.",10,1,2,15 December 1999
Armageddon," Ignore the critics, Armageddon is lots of fun
","When the message '65 million years later' appears on screen after a brief voice over explaining the dangers of an asteroid hitting the Earth, you know that a movie is not going to be serious. Indeed, whether you enjoy Armageddon is going to depend entirely on your personal taste. If you can except the end of the World as a piece of pure hokum, then you're going to have a barrel of fun. If not, then you'd better watch Deep Impact. Clearly all the critics' have far too good taste and they tried desperately to bury it. The rest of World didn't quite agree. Can a $450,000,000 gross be that far off the mark? The (admittedly ludicrous) plot centers on Bruce Willis as an oil drilling expert whose sent up into space nuke an asteroid heading for earth with a motley crew of workers including Affleck and Buscemi, giving the opportunity for some truly dazzling special effect. It also make as nice change to see a city other than an American one be destroyed in a film, as Paris gets hit by one of the fore running meteorites. Yet this mindless premise is pulled off extremely well. The first half will have you laughing at the steady stream of gags and one-liners and the second will have your heart pumping over-time as everything that could go the mission does: with a vengeance. Yet unlike the 1991 Willis flop Hudson Hawk, somehow all the noise, the action, the explosions are not at all numbing as Roger Ebert and co. would have you believe. In fact director Michael Bay orchestrates it far better and the result, for all its ridiculous story and brainless action, makes for a thrilling and unforgettable time at the movies.",8,1,1,23 January 2000
Saving Private Ryan," Lousy script and blatant Oscar begging
","Spielberg's WW2 epic has often been hailed as the greatest war movie ever made, but unfortunately an awful script hampered the brilliant performances, superb direction and the most realistic battle scenes ever filmed. A scripted was riddled with clichés and American jingoism from the start that completely marred the film and did not move me at all. It was also the most blatant attempt at Oscar begging in the history of cinema, so much so that it would have been far subtler for the entire cast and crew to spend the entire running time on their knees and plead with the Academy to give them the awards! Hank's 'I don't know anything about Ryan speech' had Best Actor Nomination Clip written all over it. Damon's 'I'm trying to picture my brothers' talk was his bid to make up for last year's disappointment for 'Good Will Hunting'. The jerky photography, which was little, more than a strain on the eyes, wrapped up Best Cinematography Oscar. The fact that the film lost out on the big night to 'Shakespeare in Love' (itself ludicrously over awarded) gave Speilberg his comeuppance. The characters to were stereotyped and cardboard and spoke utterly contrived dialogue. There's ALWAYS a religious one, Jew, an Italian, and a New Yorker, a tough sergeant and a rookie. Even Hanks (who really should think of going back to comedy films) played himself as the nice paternal figure. The film also gave out the message that the Americans won the war. There was not a single other allied soldier in the film. Not a problem on its own as Omaha was an all American landing spot, but what was unforgivable was that General Montgomery was slammed as 'overrated'. That was totally uncalled for and completely out of place in the situation. SPR was merely Speilberg exercising his greatest flaw that of recycling the same concept over and over again. SPR was in the same vain as 'Amistad' and 'Schlindler's List': that of showing the world the pain and suffering that a particular group of people went through and getting acclaim for it. The concept is wearing rather thin now Steven.",4,1,3,6 July 1999
The Man Who Would Be King," It simply triumphs on every level
","I first saw The Man Who Would Be King years ago when I was about 10 years old and in many ways it was the first 5 star, 10 out of 10 film I ever saw, regardless that it contains little fighting or action. After seeing it again a few weeks ago, it has not only lost non-of its appeal, but it rewards occasional, repeated viewings. I also realize that its credentials in terms of acting, script, direction, photography are impeccable, but unlike many films that the critics rave about, these are matched by its entertainment value. Connery and Caine play two ex-British army sergeants who attempt to become kings of a small, unknown Asian country, but are eventually betrayed by their own greed and convey a strong sense of vanity to human endeavor as a whole. Yet these weighty themes are perfectly treated by Huston and Hill's script that makes the audience like and admire these two men, in spite of their deep immoralities. Their relationship is comic, but is not just a case of one-liner swapping, but a believable and ultimately moving bond that is enhanced but the perfect casting of Connery and Caine. The result is one the most memorable male screen partnerships ever. Huston as director keeps things moving along at an enjoyable pace and his camera work and visuals create a beautiful and epic scope to the story. In the end film succeeds on every conceivable level: as entertainment, as a comedy, as an epic and as a tragic fable.",10,4,6,28 January 2000
Titanic," A wonderfully romantic epic
","Banal, crass, slushy, unoriginal, expensive, only won 11 Oscars as a `thank you' because if it had flopped the entire Hollywood studio system would have collapsed etc etc Yes all of these charges were and still are being laid against James Cameron's hugely expensive, multi Oscar winning epic. Times (and critics for that matter) never change because that is exactly the sort of thing people were saying back in the 50s and 60s with epics like Ben-Hur and look were they are in the cinema cannon. Having said that it is ironic then, Titanic is the sort of film people say they don't make anymore. It is true that some of Cameron's dialogue is not exactly Shakespeare, but everything else in the film more than makes up for it. DiCaprio and Winslet are perfect as the lovers crossing the class divide and bland lines aside Cameron's story is cleverly structured in developing the love story. From the dinner scene as Wisconsin boy DiCaprio holds his own against the snobs he's sitting with, to the detailing of the sinking itself. Cameron as director triumphs totally. At three hours long, the film feels more like 90 minutes, the recreation of the Titanic, both afloat and going under is brilliant, spectacular and thrilling. Cameron coaxes superb performances from his cast, with Zane the stand out among the supporting players as a nicely nasty villain and James Horner's beautiful music score enhances the mood of the film perfectly. Titanic hits all the emotional targets with more inspiration that is common among today's big budget films and the amount of effort that has gone into it, from the acting and not just the production is there for all to see. Even if you hated it, you can't deny that £200 million was up the on the screen.",10,1,2,19 February 2000
The Mission," Stick with it
","Irons plays a Jesuit priest who sets up a mission in the South American jungle which is then threatened by greedy merchants and political factions within the church with De Nero as a converted mercenary and slave trader. Roland Joffé's film looks superb thanks to Chris Menge's beautiful cinematography but has divided audiences and critics as to its content. It is true that the film moves along very slowly until the last half-hour and De Nero seems oddly detracted in his performance. However it never bores thanks to a sincere performance from the ever-excellent Irons and equal sincerity in Joffé's handling. Endlessly beautiful, the film evokes a true sense of period and setting with its production values, photography and Morricone's brilliant score. Although some will start fidgeting an hour in, the climax, when it comes, is deeply tragic and rewards all that has gone before and the film presents an interesting and provocative view about the hypocrisy of the church and the sheer brutality of human progress.",8,2,2,25 February 2000
Halloween," Still has its fair quota of shocks
","I wasn't alive when Halloween came out back in 1978 and when it was on TV a few weeks ago, that was the first time I saw it. There has virtually no plot, just a series of attacks in semi darkness accompanied by a haunting score it has more than its fair share of shocks, even on the small screen. At the time Roger Ebert compared it to 'Psycho'. I wouldn't go as far as that because it isn't as thoughtful Hitchcock's classic, but it does what it says it will do: provide plenty of scares and shocks which really do make in a masterstroke in B movie ingenuity. It's certainly scarier than 'The Blair Witch Project'. 8/10",8,0,0,9 December 1999
Raging Bull," A compelling study of an unlikeable man
","There are quite a few films that I could mention where the lead characters are wholly unlikeable and because they have no audience appeal, the film suffers greatly. Raging Bull is NOT one of those films. Robert De Nero puts in one of the best performances of his career as middleweight boxer Jake LaMotta. And LaMotta is not a nice chappie at all. Arrogant, rude, abusive, paranoid and obsessive are just some of the more complementary words I can think of to describe him. Yet extraordinarily this enhances rather than detracts from the film. Rather than hating him we feel deeply sorry for him because he was a man who had everything and then lost it through his own selfishness and personal insecurity. Director Scorsese's camera work is brilliant, with the boxing scenes some of the most vivid (not to mention graphic) ever filmed, all impeccably edited by Thelma Schoonmaker. The performances are all superb: Pesci as LaMotta's brother and Moriarty as his wife but especially De Nero as the self-destructive LaMotta himself. Raging Bull is the first Scorsese film that I have seen to date. On this basis I shall be seeing many more.",10,2,2,11 February 2000
Blade Runner," The ultimate vision of the future!
","What can I say about this remarkable and brilliant film that hasn't already been said a million times before? Well, here we go anyway. Blade Runner is ultimate downer when it comes to visions of what the future. So many films have copied its style and imagery of a city drenched in a non-stop rain torrent illuminated by massive neon billboards its inhabitants most beyond redemption. (Terminator, Highlander, Robocop, The Fifth Element, and even Seven, the list is endless). It is ironic then that these films have enjoyed far more commercial success on first release than the film that inspired it. Ridley Scott can then smile that while most of these films, Highlander, Terminator and Robocop especially, have significantly dated, Blade Runner remains as fresh and original as it always was. The special effects, all done with models and matte work too, haven't changed. CGI is uncalled for; air brushing would nothing for a Monet. Ford is superb as Deckard, the embittered cop assigned without much choice to track down 4 rogue replicants. Ford hates the film, partly because he was almost killed in shooting and because he claims he played 'a detective who does no detecting and who just gives focus to Scott's sets'. This is untrue, the plot is compelling as Scott and the scriptwriters, David Peoples and Hampton Fancher transposed a Marlowe case in a dire future. However the plot takes second place to mood and atmosphere. Over the course of two hours we sniff great gulps of a hopeless future and mmmm! It tastes good! The film's countless sub-texts too are more prominent than the plot. The story is littered with clues as whether Deckard is a human or replicant and asks important questions such as who we are, what we're here for. Hauer, too is brilliant as Batty, the desperate replicant leader. It's a tragedy he never found a role that came anywhere close. Supporting players, Young, Sanderson and Hannah are superb to. But its Ridley Scott who takes all the glory. As well from having one of the coolest names in cinema, this is arguable his finest hour. His subtle direction HINTS at all the themes that he covers with no overt moralising and his awe inspiring visual genius and eye for detail was repeated in the brilliant, though criminally underrated 1492: Conquest of Paradise. One is hopeful that his dark vision will be repeated in Gladiator to be released next year.",10,0,0,9 September 1999
The Sixth Sense," I had... THE FEELING!
","You know the feeling I'm talking about. The buzz deep inside you when you see a film so brilliant that no star rating, any review, anything could possibly convey how absolutely superb the film was. Well The Sixth Sense gave that feeling for the first time since I saw Death in Venice a while ago. Anyhow, the plot sees Bruce playing a child psychologist and a year after he is shot by a disgruntled patient in his home, he takes of the case of Harley Joel Osment, who has the sixth sense of the tile: the ability to see the ghosts of dead people. After Color of Night and Mercury Rising, the prospects of Willis playing a shrink AND working with a child are not good, but he is perfect for the role. Gone are is usual action man histrionics and instead he underplays the role calmly and gives a performance that is worthy an Oscar nomination at least. Child actor, Osment is superb too and mixes his role with sympathy, fear and desperation that put his performance among the child greats. 'Brat', doesn't even come into the equation. As superb as they are, the most credit has to go to writer/director M. Night Shyamalan who skillfully handles his intelligent script and comes up with a chilling atmosphere throughout the film as well as several electrifying shocks, based on relatively simply situations. Then there's the ending and a twist so perfectly executed it with have thinking for days, unpicking in your mind all that has gone before. It's that brilliant twist, plot-hole creating though it maybe, that really gives you THE FEELING.",10,0,0,16 January 2000
The Matrix," Good, but not THAT good
","I was very surprised to see this film in the top 30 films of all time. Not least for the fact that it borrows from nearly every other sci-fi film ever made such as the imagery of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and (vaguely) the plot of James Cameron's The Terminator, which are frankly, better films. The fascinating plot premise is wasted to a certain degree by the mind boggling plot and a never ending stream of psycho-babble that shows every sign of a film cramming in far too many ideas than it can handle. And then there's the lousy endingÂ… However for all these flaws The Matrix (particularly the last half hour) is very entertaining, getting by on that old trick: showmanship. It's absolutely stunning! SFX, from the mirror spreading on Neo's face, to the `flo-mo' camera shots, to that helicopter crash, are superb and are by far the most impressive of 1999's blockbusters. The Wachowski brothers direct with pace and flare and there are some very funny moments throughout (`Wooah'). Performances too, are good. Fishburne and newcomer, Moss (what a find!) shine and even Reeves is not half as wooden as usual. I was slightly disappointed, mainly due to script and after reading all the great reviews, perhaps I had set my hopes a little high. But The Matrix is by far the best summer SFX blockbuster this year. 8/10",8,0,0,24 September 1999
Heat," An average thriller, overrated by the presence of De Nero and Pacino
","A lot of people have made a lot of fuss over Heat. After seeing it for myself I really can't understand why. Aside from the presence of the two leads Heat is essentially a cops n' robbers saga given a little extra dimension and a lot of extra gloss. I can't fault Michael Mann's style. His stark vision of Los Angeles is excellent. The opening shot with the elevated train coasting past the camera with the haunting synth score is truly memorable. However, when the first shot of a film is the best part, you're in trouble. Mann as writer fairs much worse. His script (actually based on his 1989 TV movie LA Takedown) is a mess; padded his unnecessary subplots and characters; it substitutes intrigue for confused plotting. The near 3-hour running time is sheer self-indulgence, when the concept behind this film is complete mouse of idea: that cops and robbers are very much alike. In reality this so-called character development that Mann has put at the front of his film is just a story of male bonding between two highly unlikeable and unsympathetic characters. Pacino as the cop and De Nero as the robber are both well-worn clichés that are slightly deeper than normal. Pacino as an angst ridden cop, on his third marriage and De Nero as the calculating psycho criminal who plans his life so that he can drop everything and leave at 30 seconds notice when the heat is on. Both these characters are as unlikeable as the other is and this blunts much of the tension. A brilliantly staged gun battle on the streets of LA is wasted because we don't care which character comes off the better. The two leads don't do anything for their roles either. Neither gives performances that equal their best and the film's main purpose is simply to bring them on screen together. They appear twice together. Once in a coffee shop to discuss their morals and at the film's ending, which more than resembles that of Bullit. Clearly Mann has attempted to say that police and criminal are indivisible, and this is probably why we don't sympathise with either of them. This is such an unoriginal concept that has been explored as far back as the 70s with The French Connection and Serpico it also is the reason why, the film is overrated. Why should we spend 3 hours with two people we don't like?",4,8,19,11 February 2000
Jurassic Park," An exciting, superbly made blockbuster
","Jurassic Park is not an intelligent film that comments seriously about cloning and the dangers of human tampering with movie nature, though the themes are bought up occasionally in the film. The film IS however, a thrilling ride of the lines of man v. monsters. Special effects are superb: the dinosaurs are living, breathing creatures that still convince 7 years later. Director Spielberg superbly handles the action and Crichton's script skillfully builds up the tension before heading into all out action, thrills and scares. Less successfully are the performances from the human cast with Sam Neil and Laura Dern in particular phoning in their performances while Joe Mazzello's uncanny ability keep surviving after several normally fatal situations, is a tad ridiculous to say the least. However these are relatively minor flaws, because whether on the big screen, or on video, Jurassic Park's delivers amply as a thrilling blockbuster.",8,0,1,22 January 2000
