Minority Report," Awesome if you can rub two brain cells together.
","I am in shock at the number of people bad mouthing this film, and truthfully find many of their comments comical.  The story is awesome and very original.  Unlike what some other people would lead you to believe, you don't need to make any religious or metaphysical self realizations to enjoy this film.  The concept is not a difficult one to grasp, and no more difficult to buy into than any other movie ever made - especially considering...helloooo....it's a science fiction movie!!  These are probably the same people complaining about Bugs Bunny cartoons not being realistic enough.  Some people complain that the story is too complex and confusing - I would simply call it interesting.  You don't need to be Einstein to follow this one, but it does keep you guessing.  I thought that made it good. Solid casting, solid acting, superb story, great action (not OVERdone), intense effects, Spielberg magic, and as always a fantastic score from John Williams.  Very stylish shooting and editing - bravo.  I don't know what else people were expecting.  I guess if you like movies like 'Legally Blonde' you should probably stay clear of this one, it might make you think a little bit.  If you could follow Total Recall give this one a shot - it's awesome.",Null,0,0,29 June 2003
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," This movie is a good time - PERIOD!
","How people can bash this movie is beyond me - can you find flaws in the plot line - yes.  Are there occasional inconsistencies - yes. Are they any worse in this movie than the ones in Star Wars and Indiana Jones - no.  Instead of nitpicking every little thing that Speilberg did wrong, why not take a step back and look at all he did right.  This movie has some excellent acting (Goldblum and Postlewaite),a very good story, certainly good enough to string together all the incredible action sequences and movie magic that we're engulfed by throughout the entire film, and it actually pulls off a little moral statement about our society (both the stupidity of some hunters wanting to kill anything they can, and the stupidity of some tree hugging peace-niks that think everything should be saved.)  The suspense is there too - I actually jumped out of my seat watching the movie again last night during the raptor/shack scene.  People were obviously expecting something else from this movie when they bash it, but what WERE they expecting?!?! This movie has all the coolness of the first film and delivers extra - 2 t-rexes, new dinos, great capture sequence, and the entire SanFran ending is fantastic (who as a child didn't have nightmares that looked EXACTLY like what happened to the little boy?).  If this movie had been the first Jurassic Park movie, people wouldn't have enough good things to say about it, and the first one would be a pretty weak follow up - wouldn't it?  To throw in a personal music opinion it is like the band Boston's first two album releases.  The first one became an instant classic and one of the most played albums possibly ever - because it was great and nothing had ever sounded like it before.  Their second album sounded just as good as the first, same strong songwriting and catchy riffs, only something already sounded like that before, so people were less taken by it.  Take my word for it - this movie is a good time, even though it's the SECOND dinosaur movie to be a good time.9 of 10, but it gets a 10 to make up for idiots that bombed it.",10,41,82,25 September 2001
Windtalkers," awful, awful, awful
","Without feeling the need to summarize the plot line, I will simply state the major downfalls of this movie. Nicolas Cage was one the all time best comedic actors, why the hell anyone thinks that means he's an action hero is way beyond me.  His character was so lacking any depth or believability it was actually painful to watch.  Overdone cliche after overdone cliche plagues this film from start to finish and the importance of the codetalkers - what I thought was the entire purpose of the film - is left in the dust. Whenever they get in trouble they would invariably come to the realization 'IF WE ONLY HAD A RADIO!!!' - okay so what did this codetalker do that a regular radio man couldn't have done?  I have no idea - he called in artillery and planes. OOOOhhhh.... I still don't get it.  The action is so overdone that it isn't even fun to watch.  Impressive explosions a plenty, but in an age where realistic war films have become the order of the day, Woo snubs his nose at Spielberg and takes us back to the days when Rocky Balboa could take out a helicopter with a bow and arrow.  Shallow and unredeeming seem to sum up the whole feel of the film for me and the only reason it gets a 2 is because the sound effects were awesome on a surround sound system.  Save yourself the time and disappointment - watch Rambo instead, at least you'll feel patriotic. PS- I just checked the DVD box to see if I spelled Nicolas right and noticed that it says 'From the director of MI-2' which makes the fact that I watched this my own fault.  MI-2 was possibly one of the only 'ultra-Hollywood' action movies actually worse than this one.  Shame on ME!",2,2,5,29 June 2003
