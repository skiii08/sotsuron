The Blair Witch Project," Total Crap! Don't waste your money.
","When I first heard of the movie plus all the great reviews I've read about it, I thought to myself.. wow... maybe finally something that could scare the crap out of me. Verdict : Na-ah! The movie was a rad! and a dud! The WORST movie I have ever seen. Oh sure... it looks real..but? so what???? I could have done the movie myself! and earn millions of dollars AND top the movie charts. I tell you... the movie was full of night scenes that we(the good old audiences ) can't even see! what the hell is happening. I rather scare myself watching Teletubbies! I can sum up the movie right here for you. 3 students went into the woods, got lost, found some scary stuff, got scared out of their wits by something (presumably by a hairy witch which do something to people) and died. End of Story. So what else is new? I'd rather watch the Exorcist then watch the Blair Witch Project again. Lemme tell you.... it's a total waste of money.",1,0,2,19 August 1999
