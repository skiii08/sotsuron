Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Rated R Candid Camera
","Interesting for a candid camera episode. But when you look at the movie as a whole. A pretty shallow (at times disgusting piece of work) and juvenile movie. What on God's green earth is funny about two ugly naked men wrestling or putting down Jews. Just disgusting!! Being a psychology major, I enjoy watching real people in unusual situations, but the plot around this idea lacked any substance. The movie will not bore you, but you might wonder why it was even made after you take time to think about it. I recommend that you do not use this movie as a first date movie, but rather a movie to show someone if you wish to shock them with weird humor.",5,3,7,24 November 2006
We Were Soldiers," Best War Movie I've ever seen!!
","Awesome movie!!  This movie doesn't just show you the war, it drops you in the middle of it!! This movie is not for everyone, because the battle scenes are never ending.  Besides the battle scenes, there are other scenes which involve the wives of the men whom are involved in the war. For this reason, you may get away with calling it a partial Chic Flix in order to persuade your wife or girlfriend to watch it.My suggestion is to shove this movie into you DVD or video player, raise the volume, and just sit back and enjoy (if you can) all of the explosions, scenery, and carnage this fine movie has to offer (that sounds weird). This an extremely exciting, well acted film and should have been noticed at Oscar time.  My pick for my favorite war movies.  1) We were Soldiers 2) Windtalkers 3) Escape From Sobibor 4) Casualties of War 5) Blackhawk Down WATCH THEM ALL!!",10,9,15,21 August 2002
