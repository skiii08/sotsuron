It," overrated movie
","nothing special, really wondering how they rated above 8/10 or 4/5. not scary at all. may be kids less than 12 may enjoy. it looks like all are paid or promotional review or rating. if you're expecting scary or thrilling experience then better skip this one. not worth for the money.",2,55,109,11 September 2017
Uri: The Surgical Strike," avg movie, nothing much to say.
","Stroy line - i'll leave to viewer to accept or reject because its indian politician version of undisclosed truth.
otherwise as a Bollywood movie , nothing much to say. few over hyped sentiment scene , BGM sometimes i felt like bollywood song theme. lol!!!
But its good try but ended up as typical Medicore movie to show one side propaganda.",5,1,2,20 March 2019
