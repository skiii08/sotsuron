Marie Antoinette," Wonderful .
","This movie is beautiful . I do agree that it was kind of boring , the first part of the movie went okay , it when boring once in a while ; but the scene where Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) was running through the gardens, and the birthday party gave a brilliant scene . The music was fantastic too . The costumes were beautiful , and every scene that there was a cake ; I wanted one ! The connection between Count Fersen and Marie Antoinette affair went really well. I couldn't see the connection between King Louis and Marie Antoinette ; they could have had more lines then just staring at each other , but the ending it shows that King Louis had loved for Marie as she had for him, as she reached for his hand, and he holds it . Overall , this movie was boring but BEAUTIFUL .",7,1,3,1 November 2007
Disturbia," Awesome Thriller
","When I first when to the theater to watch Disturbia , I didn't think it would be that great since all my friends didn't like it at all . But , I guess they were wrong . I found it very interesting, it leaves you with a nail biting emotion , David Morse scared the heck out of me . The acting was fantastic , they were able to portray a normal teenage life when suddenly they found out there was a killer in their neighboorhood . Aaron Yoo made me laugh the whole time when he was trying to scare Shia when he was in the closet . I also loved the part where hes in the house with the camera =] Shia and Sarah's connection was very good . I loved this movie , it makes one of my top ten .",8,1,3,2 November 2007
