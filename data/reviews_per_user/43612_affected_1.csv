Minority Report," A lot of wasted potential
","Throughout this film - although I quite enjoyed watching it - I had this nagging feeling it could have been SO much better, something SO much more profound and thought-provoking if only they hadn't made it just another murder thriller. That, unfortunately, is what it is in the end, despite all the sci-fi elements and plot twists. Such a waste of a very good idea, and a real shame it's not a more intelligent film.",Null,0,0,7 August 2002
