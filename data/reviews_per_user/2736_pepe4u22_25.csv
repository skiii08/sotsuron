The Avengers," OMG what a waster
","Went to this movie with high expectations but after being bored for basically 2/3 of the movie it picked up..Too much time wasted on secondary characters like black widow, the archer character and the every annoying Samuel L Jackson and his equally annoying character Nick Fury...gee i wanted to see action not a snippet here a snippet there and the hulk basically not being shown except for the near end and a slight flurry on the invisible flying boat...not enough of the major stars and just too ponderous and cheap laughs to break the long stretches of monotony plus like any cliqued movie the death of a character to bring the team together seen that too many times...basically with some of the talent available for this movie the return was awful and i was just way too bored by the time the action hit and just annoyed by prementioned reliance on minor characters to really care...could have been wonderful but was a major disappointment",4,9,24,8 May 2012
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," what a waste
",watched this last night and oh my god what a waste of time. first again another star wars movie that is a copy and paste from the original movie. the leads have the charisma of road kill the effects were loud and just all over the place unlike john wick where the action scenes are were done and have fluidity the fx on this movie all over the place and one has no idea where in the world the participants are in comparison to the action at times. the dialogue is wooden and just a waste of time and a cash grab for the studio.,1,4,10,24 July 2017
Iron Man 2," Grab your popcorn and get ready for the ride
",Just came back from Iron Man 2 and it is a movie to be enjoyed. One feels like a young child watching this movie as it plays out like a comic book in front of the viewer. The pace and action of the movie are terrific. Robert Downey Jr.'s acting and presence in the movie carries it with charm and charisma and you like the Tony Starke character who unlike other comic book hero alter egos actually is not nebbish. Gwyneth Paltrow is good in this movie though she is more wallpaper in many of the scenes and the Sam Rockwell character was just a joy to watch. Mickey Rourke rocks in his role as he eats scenery with panache and yet his acting is so natural. If I had any problem with this movie was the presence of Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johanssen they were just draining on the movie. Jackson again plays the same character he has been playing for it seems the last 15-20 years and basically puts me off any movie he appears in while Scarlett may be easy to look at but what is the big deal about her acting she is listless and incredibly charisma free. The director Jon Favreau is superb and his acting is fun and basically grab your popcorn and get ready for the ride and with AC/DC music what else can one ask for. My rating 9 but the Jackson/Johannsen presence you lose 2 for a 7,7,0,3,11 May 2010
The Hunger Games," Sad waste of time
",Went to this movie with a lot of hype and a lot of word of mouth unfortunately it was for nought..this movie based on a book must have been lifted from many a b 80's movies..i watched this movie and thought saw this in running man with Arnold..jean Claude van Dame's hard target also the society out of a handmaiden's tale with Natasha Richardson and many many b movies that tend to play late night on cine-max back in the day..Jennifer Lawrence gives a great performance in this tripe though and woody Harrelson was good but questions are why was Elizabeth banks in such gosh awful attire. also the movie was just too long with a lot of leaden dialogue and a lot of slow periods my goodness..thank goodness i saw this on cheap night because no way would i ever pay full price for this i call this awful ..also look for a ode to romeo and Juliette near the end. A bad experience to all plus the clich√©d dictatorial rule my goodness how many movies has that been in. The pacing was poor and where did the love come in after the first scenes thought it was going in a another directions..but woe is me,2,25,43,27 March 2012
The Hateful Eight," not Tarantino's best but still better than rest
",wish I could give a 6.5 but a seven will do..the dialogue was terrific as per usual in a Tarantino movie and the performance of kurt Russell and jemmifer Jason leigh were the best parts of the movie followed by the performance of Micheal madsen. I also like the way this movie was shot the 70mm format is wonderful and expansive but unlike pulp fiction or djanjo unchained this movie falls short of their excellence and part of that was due to some minor things and one big thing. the one big thing was the phone in performance of Samuel L. Jackson who has been playing his pulp fiction character for way too long for and that costs 2 points automatically for me and it was just too long . the violence was raw and believable and the Agatha Christie twist of a mystery was terrific but this movie is still a quality to watch.,7,1,7,20 January 2016
The Expendables," Action action and more action
","Waited with great expectations for this movie because it reminded me of my youth with the stars cast and the anticipation of real fast and non stop action and I was not disappointed. The cameos of the zenith of 80's action stars Stallone, Arnie and Bruce was like the meeting of the titans. The action started and never let up. The script and plotting were somewhat awry at times but who cares the action and the reaction of the audience made this movie fun.. The highlight was the performance of Eric Roberts and Mickey Rourke they were simply awesome.. Kudos to Dolph Lundgren for a nuanced performance and the rest of the stars shined in their roles...If you like action if you like to be entertained go to this movie.",8,2,9,16 August 2010
Captain America: The First Avenger," not bad not bad at all
",well when i was a boy i loved marvel comics and was very impressed by the adaptation to this movie..the characters were just like in the comics and it was a wonderful popcorn movie. The sets were well done and the action was good and the red skull was awesome..the problem that i had with the movie was the flat performance of the the lead Chris Evans and the fact that they found the shield at the first of the movie killed the suspense for the movie as you know Captain America was going to be there through it all and of course not being a Samuel L Jackson fan any sight of him gets an automatic two stars off as i am tired of the same acting style for the last twenty years since pulp fiction my goodness get some range..the lead actress was wonderful and of course tommy lee jones was chewing scenes with aplomb,5,0,3,6 April 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," simply sensational
",i went to this movie after awesome word of mouth and i was not disappointed..the acting and direction of movie is dead on and the nuances had me engrossed for the total movie which went fast even though it is quite long..the movie is not for the faint of heart but at the same time how it is laid out in format there were two stories that came together and it clicked on all levels..would recommend to anyone to see this terrific movie..and i will add in the hands of a less talented director unlike fincher this could have been a disaster and this is why when he makes a movie i go and see for he is the best director right now in my opinion,9,1,6,7 January 2012
Dunkirk," very disappointing
",heard the buzz for this movie and just was so disappointed. the movie starts not even referring to the Germans or Nazis but called them the enemy oh my goodness sanitizing of history strike one. I watched and was shaking head on the continuity as one scene would have night and then go to day and the strange pacing for the tom hardy character as one scene is battling the Germans on limited gas and an hour later he is still flying and lands what the heck. plus this is a war zone but the horrors of fighting also are sanitized with pc sanctimony I was bored watching as one never can feel a connection with the characters which is something I noticed in the wonderful era of war movies of the 1960's as in that period all major actors seemed to be in the military which gave a certain gravitis to their performances in this movie all performances are hollow and unengaging.,3,15,25,25 July 2017
Bad Teacher," Bad is Good
",A comic tour de force by Cameron Diaz as she plays a self absorbed totally inappropriate middle school teacher. Cameron plays Elizabeth Halsey a gold digging self centred self absorbed teacher who first is on her way to marrying her sugar daddy. Well that goes awry when he dumps her and she has to comeback to work as a teacher which she is not yours or my teacher. She sneaks and connives to meet a new man and thinks she finds him in the Justin Timberlake character who she thinks could be her new sugar daddy since he comes from money while being pursued by the gym teacher played by Jason Segel..Well Cameron's Halsey thinks breast implants are the way to catch a man..i would go on more but go see this movie the laughs are abundant and every scenario is a joy...,8,4,10,28 June 2011
Goon," Good hockey movie
","actually giving this movie a 6.5 rating. the movie is a wonderful look into the hockey culture with the fans clamoring for the goon who usually is the least talented player on the ice..this film has a wonderful cast and the lead was terrific emboding the dim witted stereotype of a goon or policeman. the movie has all the little things that one sees when watching the local hockey team play...the puck bunny, the code, the blood thirsting crowd, the stereotype of the french Canadian hockey player, the stereotype of the Russian hockey player, the old school coach along with the prerequisite cursing and bloodletting. Though what separated this movie from the usual was the good acting and the likability of the lead and the dread and evil incarnate of the Liev Schrieber character. for a bonus watch for the appearance of the trailer park boys in small cameos.",6,1,6,10 March 2012
Bridesmaids," Wonderfully humorous
",Just came back from this wonderfully funny and well received movie. I had a chance to watch this movie with the target audience that being a strong female presence in the audience. What i found was a funny hilarious movie with that unlying feeling that the character played by the funny lady from other apatow movie ms wiig. The movie is basic about an upcoming wedding and the fun with some bridesmaids.. Just go to this movie and enjoy the experience will bring a lot of laughs and some tears but a tight and wonderful experience and look for some slight resemblance to the hangover but with more depth of character. I loved this movie and it was made better by excellent writing and strong performances by all,8,3,8,17 May 2011
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," wonderful entertainment
",truly a popcorn movie with a kinetic energy that starts fast and goes faster as the movie goes on..the acting is good but not special but this is a movie of action and stunts and it delivers on these points..tom cruise plays tom cruise a role he excels at and the movie is his showcase with able assistance from his co stars and at the same time there is continuity from mission impossible three but the ride is fast and furious so sit back and enjoy as this is worth the popcorn..though if i had any problem with the movie was the at times awkward attempts at humor which took a bit of the movie away from the action but if that is what i found wanting then it is not that bad at all,8,3,7,7 January 2012
The Bourne Legacy," what was this
","Watched this movie and I left puzzled what did I watch? Two hours later still what did I watch? A great cast wasted outside of a couple superb action sequences this movie was very unwatchable as it seemed it was another movie shoehorned started and then changed to this. Outside of the lovely scenic closing scene which I wish I was doing instead of watching this I was absolutely flummoxed by the entire experience. As I sit here writing this review I think of the waste of money and talent and just shake my head. Ed Norton looks completely bored, the delightful Rachel Weiz has that look of what did I do to my agent to be in this movie while at least Jeremy Renner got an excuse to workout for the next Avengers movie.",Null,0,3,23 September 2015
Jurassic World," Are you kidding me
",This movie was much hype but when I started watching it I had seen this movie before it was called Jurassic Park and this script is a retread of an original idea. Let me say the dinosaurs looked great that was the highlight. \ Now the lowlights 1.Lead female character and her high heels nd how idiotic it was 2. Annoying kids again what is with these movies that the kids can do things adults can do yes dinosaur chasing me and I will get a 22 year old vehicle working really are you kidding me 3. Raptor whisperer do I have to say more just the thought my IQ went down 20 points 4. Raptors for military use 5. Ex military man dominating raptors yes totally believable NOT 6. Above character saying he is the ALPHA omg stupid 7. Lack of chemistry of leads they had the combined charisma of stale three day old donuts 8. What is this parents getting a divorce story that went poof who cares 9. Wasting good actors like Vincent D'Onofrio and BD Wong 10. The chase scene with TRex and how people are outrunning dinosaurs who in previous movies can run up to 40 mph when top sprinters top out at 27 and the silly woman was standing straight in from of t rex and outran it and was not eaten omg,1,20,41,20 October 2015
Thor," Boring and very disappointing
","I came to this movie with high expectations as I as a boy always loved Marvel comics and have really enjoyed the adaptations of Spiderman, The Hulk and Iron Man. Well the experience was not accentuated by the 3D experience. The lead of Thor was some unknown and he was as wooden as balsam wood and the fish out of water scenario has been done too many times. Anthony Hopkins mailed in this performance I think he is taking over from Micheal Caine for the I will do anything for a buck prestige actor and reigning Oscar winner Natalie Portman must have done this to add to her Q rating and to have people say that they have seen her in a movie besides her art-house genre. The action was sporadic to me and just went on like Chinese water torture..The only good part no presence of Samuel L Jackson for this upcoming Avengers movie orelse i would have had to give this movie a 0",1,8,18,17 May 2011
The Big Short," a wonderful movie
","this is a great movie with terrific performances that show the behind the scenes look at the housing crisis that triggered the housing crisis in the USA. all performances less one are on point and poignant I was entraptured by the goings on behind the scenes, the questions and the research and the duplicity of banks, governments and regulation to deny the error of their ways..Christian bale, ryan gosling and mr40 year old virgin are standouts the only character I found off key was brad pitt who had the that stoned looked to his character much like his stoner looking performance in world war Z. I recommend this movie if one wants a thinking movie .",8,0,0,20 January 2016
Prometheus," A wonderful movie with a lot of fun
",I was excited to see this movie and my excitement was after I left the movie..The movie had terrific pacing and what i liked was there was story telling that was not rushed and not put there to make movie progress faster. like a well cooked meal the movie slowly moved to the point that the action just seemed second nature..i was captivated by the questions pondered by the movie of where did we come from and why were this civilization trying now to destroy us....the scene of the computerized abortion was just jaw dropping as was the wonderful landscapes of iceland which was the stand in for the new planet..the acting superlative in particular Micheal fassberg and charlize theron..watch this and see that a blockbuster does not just have to be loud but with a good story it can be memorable.,8,0,5,14 June 2012
Wonder Woman," typical dc promise turns wrong
",Went to this movie with high expectations and the first third of movie started terrific with terrific character development and wonderful acting then with the introduction of the Chris Pine the movie starts a quick descent. Pine plays the damsal in distress and has the screen presence of a slug no emotion and just a pretty face but vacuous. then the movie shifts to London and we are met with an array of characters who come and go in a heartbeat. then we go to the part that absolutely annoyed me is how this movie treated in many ways the character of Ludendorff and I hope the producers are ashamed of the way they showed a true military leader in such disregard that they killed him in movie when the real Ludendorff died almost 20 years later is a joke and as a person who's family served in the first war under Ludendorff I found this offensive. now if they had any clue why not just make up a character like movies have done for the last 100 years and use some creativing have the aries character move from Ludendorff character to an obscure Austrian corporal known as Hitler. also the scene where pines character infiltrated the German high command castle was stupid too having an character of eastern descent driving a car to a German retreat and they would not be alarmed stupid and ludicrous. plus the pacing of movie slow could have been tightened easily 20 minutes and the constant cuts in action scenes made me want to watch good action scenes like in john wick and john wick 2. the best part of movie was gal gadat the lead giving a wonderful performance everything else was an abdomination,3,8,22,3 June 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Copy and paste
",Well after much anticipation I went to this movie and it was so deja vu. Why was it so deja vu is because it is the ultimate copy and paste job I ever seen I swear plagiarism could easily be made between this movie and the original movie let me count a few ways. 1. Both movies set on a backwater colony planet 2. Deadly force blows up planets 3. Droid with secret running from evil bad guys 4. Chief lead has mystic power 5. Respected actor tells way of this force 6. Respected actor dies near end of movie 7. Alien bar scene in both 8. Deadly death star/planet blown up by good guys 9. Major character in robes with moustache and beard 10. Good guys caught in a tractor beamThe special effects were great but most of this movie had the I have seen this before feeling and to pass time I guessed what was going to happen and sadly I was right. No originality no new ground covered just a grab for your wallet. F/X gets a 7 the rest of movie gets a -4,3,26,34,31 December 2015
RED," A quality action flick
","A terrific movie with great action and terrific premise and exceptional performances. Bruce Willis plays a retired CIA agent who is marked for elimination by some blackops while he is trying to romance the Mary Louise Parker character who is looking for mr right. The action unfolds taking the unlikely duo across America and meeting up with his old partners in the business to solve who is after them. John Malkovich shines in his role as Marvin and he chews up scenery with panache. Helen Mirren, Richard Dreyfus, Brian Cox and Morgan Freeman are also terrific in their roles. Nice also to see Ernest Borgnine in the role of a CIA records keeper. The action is fast and furious and loud and you get a lot of bang in this tight and taut action spectacle.",7,1,1,21 February 2011
Deadpool," awesome
","I have to admit I never heard of this comic character so I went to see this movie with excitement and curiosity and was treated to the best comic movie since the original iron man. unlike the iron man sequels and the other thor, captain America and disappointing avengers flicks this movie sparkles and is not so cookie cutter. ryan Reynolds is terrific in the lead with many witty comments including a few at his expense making the is movie fun and original plus the r rating allowed this movie to move into more adult direction than the other marvel properties. I found the story fun while the action was well done and it seemed everyone making this movie enjoyed themselves and did not phone in any performances and I hope to see more r rated comic book adaptions while seeing less of the cookie cutter and after seeing this I look forward to the sequel because I totally enjoyed it",8,4,14,16 February 2016
The Great Escape," 7.5 for a rousing adventure
",Loved this movie was action filled and exciting with the stunt work for the Steve McQueen chase scene was a classic. The movie is about a true escape from a POW camp during WW2. The movie was star studded and well done and I think the characters that I adored the most were the James Garner character and the Donald Pleasance characters as they just brought a humanity to the screen. I liked the fact that the movie was full of character and had a sense of hope in it as the prisoners tunnelled out yet if I did have a problem with the movies it was with the Richard Attenbrough character and his cohorts as the leaders. I found they did nothing in many regards while everyone else was working hard with the tunnel while their characters just did squat. I was not sad to see them shot but was saddened when Donald Pleasance character died and that is because they were unlikeable compared to the rest.,7,2,4,26 February 2016
Spectre," Disappointing but better than most
","As the title says disappointing but better than them most other. a disappointment after sky fall but better than most movies out there. I found this movie followed the good/bad cycle in the Craig movies the even number are terrific while the even numbered are poor. I found this movie took literally parts of at least four other bond movies and literally copied and pasted into this movie. I also found the movie a good thirty minutes too long and I must say I want to see bond in action not q, m or money penny. In then pantheon of bond movies I found it in the middle but well above any Brosnam except golden eye. Overall though there also seemed to have a wanting to go more gadgets and gals but stay gritty like the bourne movies so I felt torn watching it but I will say the action sequences are terrific.",6,0,5,12 November 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," an action extravaganza
",watch this movie after positive word of mouth and I must say the compliments I heard were short compared to the spectacular movie experience this was. the action scenes were out of this world with terrific action pieces that were intense and terrific. the visuals of this movie were cutting edge and made this experience so raw and so memorable. even though mad max on title he is more of a sidekick to the furiosa character who was the lead and played terrifically by Charlize Theron who shines above all in this movie. The plot was interesting but it did not get in the way of the action which was relentless and absorbing. This is a movie deserving of all the accolades it has gotten and in the future this movie will be remembered more than the movies that won at the Oscars for this movie has staying power while all the others are just willow whisp in the wind.,8,1,8,1 March 2016
