The Ring," Terrible. some spoilers.
","Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) is a young journalist with a divorced husband, Noah (Martin Henderson), and a son, Aidan (David Dorfman). Her niece was recently found dead with a look of pure shock embedded in her face as if something scared her to death. Upon learning that her niece's three friends died at the same time, too, and hearing about a disturbing videotape that is said to kill you seven days after watching it, Rachel comes into the possession of that same tape. Now, as time grows short, Rachel and Noah race to save their lives from impending doom and discover what the tape has to do with a tragedy-stricken horse ranch and a very strange little girl named Samara (Daveigh Chase). The original 'Ringu' was a work of art. it was scary...no, terrifying, original, creepy, and inspirational. When Hollywood wasn't doing so good, what was it time to do? remake it, except replace engaging characters with annoying ones, devoid any suspense and replace it with cheesy writing, and ruin what could have been a great remake completely. Thats not to say the big budget wasn't good for nothing, though.....the direction is stylish, the cinematography is okay, and there were 2 (yes, only two) scary parts: When they discover Katie's corpse in the closet and when the cursed tape is first shown. aside from that, it's quite boring. Just terrible. My rating for 'The ring':1.5/10.About the DVD: Dreamworks has released an uninteresting DVD for the film. The 1:85.1 aspect ratio has lots of obvious edge enhancement and....surprisingly...some grain as well. The colors are ugly (The dark green cinematography certainly didn't help) and skin tones are bland. The audio, however, is excellent. The surround sound effects are quite good and make the film more jumpy than it really is. For extras we get exactly two crappy features--the first being billed as a 'Documentary', when it is really only a slew of deleted scenes woven together seamlessly. The second feature is a trailer. The DVD's respectability is only a notch above the film itself. My rating for the DVD: 3.5/10.",Null,0,1,28 May 2004
Underworld," Had the film not taken an MTV approach, it might have been pretty good...
","Set in some timeless world where vampires rule, clans of werewolves are being hunted and killed to the brink of extinction by the vampires. A wolf hunter, Selene, begins questioning is she's taken the right side, and slowly uncovers the truth behind how she became a vampire. Now since I like to consider myself a fair critic, I'll start with what I liked about 'Underworld'. For one, the overall premise is very good. I especially like the fact that we never know when or where the film actually takes place (we never see outside the city) and the timeless feel of the film. While the acting wasn't exactly outstanding, everyone was serviceable and there wasn't a single actor here I could call 'bad'.Thirdly, the creature effects were awesome. Thankfully the werewolf were usually brought to life via practical effects, with CG limited mostly to the transformation scenes (I wish these too were done practically, like in American Werewolf in London or The Howling, but I guess in a year like 2003, that's too much to ask forthat's pretty sad). There was also a good amount of blood and gore too, thankfully this is an R-rated film that actually DESERVES it's R-rating. I also liked the ending, which in my opinion was clever and unexpected (well, as clever and unexpected as a dumb action film can be). This, unfortunately, is where the list of positive aspects ends. Len Wiseman's direction is wwwaaayyy too commercial for my taste (you know, MTV-style camera angles, slow-motion fight scenes, etc.), the music is crap (mostly rock musicwhat's wrong with using a REAL score these days?), the action is often unrealistic (and not in a fun way) and the CG, while not used excessively, was cheesy and unconvincing. I know that the positive aspects will outweigh the negatives in some people's opinion (in other words, I can understand why some people will enjoy this film), but for me the movie really didn't do anything.Sorry.4/10.",4,0,2,27 August 2005
Scary Movie 2," Hysterical sequel. (spoilers)
","PLOT:Megan Voorhees (Natasha Lyonne), is possessed and two priests, Father McFeely (James Woods) and Father Harris (Andy Richter), must drive the demon out, but the exorcism doesn't go as planned. A year later, survivors Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), Ray Wilkins (Shawn Wayans), and Shorty (Marlon Wayans) and Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall), are at college, trying to forget the incidents that occurred last Halloween. Cindy is falling for Buddy (Christopher Kennedy Masterson), who loves to give wedgies, and Ray is still confused about his sexuality. Professor Oldman (Tim Curry) and his paralyzed assistant, Dwight (David Cross), have decided to do a research study at Hell House, the house where the bad exorcism took place, and disguise it as a sleep disorder study. Chaos starts as soon as Cindy arrives and meets the creepy caretaker (Chris Elliot) with the funny hand. But the house has some deep dark secrets that the group has to solve, even if they are scary or disgusting.DIRECTING: 7/10- Director Keenen Ivory Wayans directs this film competently with lots of slow-motion shots and Matrix-like camera angles.WRITING: 8/10- Call the jokes crude, but I loved them. No, 'Scary movie 2' has no intelligent, thought-provoking or meaningful dialogue but I thought that it was funny, original (Love the Amityville joke) and witty. While the third may have been funnier, this is still great fun and the jokes improved greatly over the original.ACTING: 9/10- All the characters are memorable and funny, and the actors fit their parts perfectly. Great cast, too.GORE: 2/10- Mostly cartoon violence. A man gets his skull cut off, but his heads empty, a chalandeer falls on a girl, a man's hair catches on fire, people get punched and kicked, etc. Nothing graphic or frightening happens.MONSTERS: WE get a few. A Possessed demon girl (Excorsist-derived), a killer plant monster, and there is also some semi-visible ghosts. We also get a skeleton creature. This is one of the fakest monsters I've ever seen, but it serves it's purpose by getting it's head put on it's pubic bone and it's limbs put in different sockets.SPECIAL F/X: 3/10- The effects are intermitent in quality. The creature effects, especially the skeleton and the plant creature, were accomplished via cable puppets and it's obvious--the cables and puppeteers are visible in many shots. Some of the other effects, however, are pretty good, including computer generated ghosts and flying furniture.SOUNDTRACK: 7/10- The film boasts a pretty good soundtrack. I dug the song during the end credits.FINAL VERDICT: 'Scary movie 2' is a great sequel. It spoofs everything from the haunting to poltergiest and it's all great fun. My rating for 'Scary movie 2'--8/10.",Null,1,3,28 February 2004
Resident Evil," Zombies and mutants and monsters, oh my!
","After a deadly virus escapes from a lab, a secret underground facility becomes a living hell as the staff is turned into undead zombies. To make matters worse, there are mutant creatures on the loose. Alice, a security operative for the subterranean lab, with the aid of a group of soldiers, enter the lab to see what happenedonly to discover escape seems impossible. This film is understandably hated by many people for various reasons, some of which I agree with and some of which I don't. The biggest problem with the film is writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson. He clearly is capable of making a good and enjoyable film, which he proved with 1997's underrated Event Horizon. However, his direction here is unfortunately MTV-style in naturethat is, there are lots of slow-motion shots during the action sequences and even a bullet-time shot or two. I do, however, really like the general atmosphere he gives the filmthe scene near the beginning of the film with Alice walking through the giant mansion is decidedly atmospheric and creepy. Unfortunately, the actors are all wooden, and most of the characters are easily recognizable as creature/zombie fodder from the second they enter the screen. While I really liked the main theme music for the film, the rock music employed for the action scenes is terrible and obnoxious as hell. While there are a couple of good bloody bits here and there, most of the gore is computer-generated and looks absolutely awful. On the topic of bad CG, the first stage of 'The Licker', one of the mutant creatures, looks HORENDOUS!!! I'm talking sci-fi-channel-original-movie level CG. It must be seen to be believed! Fans of old-school horror will be happy to know that once the licker eats it's first victim it mutates into a predominantly animatronic creature, which looked great. I also really liked the ending (though, granted, it rips off John Carpenter's underrated 1995 flick In the Mouth of Madness pretty badly).In conclusion, Resident Evil may be flawed and relatively brainless at times, but it's entertaining and way, way better than its terrible sequel. 4/10.",4,0,1,10 August 2005
Alien vs. Predator," It's okay--better than Resident Evil: Apocalypse at the very least!
","During an Archaeological expedition in Antarctica, the crew finds an ancient temple, undiscovered by modern man. Once they enter it, they discover a race of aliens are inhabiting it, and that another alien speciesthe predatorsare using this temple as a hunting grounds for the aliens. And the humans are caught right in the middle Alright, I'll be honest. AVP is by no means perfect. There are many flaws/plot holes, a lack or gore and scares, and the CG is awful. But seriously, this is a HUGE improvement over the jaw-droppingly stupid 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse', Paul Anderson's previous film. Starting with what works here: The actors, especially Lance Henriksen, one of my favorite actors, all did a fine job. There was no actor who gave a wooden or bland performance, unlike 'Apocalypse' which had it's fair share of awful acting. The creature effects, courtesy of Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr., who were also responsible for the creatures in 1990's 'Tremors', were quite impressive. The aliens had very lively, fluid movement, and the predator make-up was top-notch. The pacing was brisk but never too fast, and the film has a satisfying (albeit predictable) twist ending. Thankfully, all the things I hated about the Resident Evil filmsthe bullet time shots, loud rock music, unbelievably stupid plot twists, lets-make-the-story-up-as-we-go-along writing and lack of credible performanceswere all absent from this film. There are many problems, yessuch as glaring plot holes you could march a parade through, and an obvious ignorance fore the time-line of the 'Alien' trilogy (If the REAL Bishop is seen at the end of Alien 3, which is set hundreds of years in the future, how can he be in this film, which is set in 2004?!?!?), not to mention the occasional moments of over-the-top action (Such as our Heroin's escape from a HUGE explosion with the help of one of the predators), and the alien queen, once she shows up to do battle at the end, is one truly awful CG creation, especially the shots of it runningthose were B-A-D! There is also, as I said above, a disappointing lack of gore, though there is a lot of alien goop splashing everywhere, which is always fun.Through all these flaws, though, I managed to enjoy AVP more than I had expected to. Give it a chance and you might like it. By no stretch of the imagination is this a great film, but it isn't all bad, either.5.5/10.",5,7,14,15 July 2005
Hellboy," The plot is rather confusing, but their is never a dull moment!
","In the final days of World War II, the Nazis attempt to use black magic to aid their dying cause. The Allies raid the camp where the ceremony is taking place, but not before a demon - Hellboy - has already been conjured. Joining the Allied forces, Hellboy eventually grows to adulthood, serving the cause of good rather than evil. 'Hellboy' is one of the best comic-book films to date, leaving 'Spawn' and 'spider-man' in the dust. Yet this film isn't quite what i expected. The film is full of great monsters and characters, but lacks a coherent story line. Director Del Toro (Who scored big with 'Blade 2') does a great job in rendering the dark atmosphere that the comics had, but the plot needed to be developed much, much better. Oh, well. Ron Perlman is great as hellboy and the special effects are EXCELLENT! 7-7.5/10.",Null,0,1,18 April 2004
Event Horizon," Sharp, scary science fiction thriller.
","The year is 2047 and a ship named the Event Horizon has re-appeared after disappearing 7 years prior, in experiments for faster than light travel. A rescue hastily speeds to the returned vessel after a transmission was picked up from the ship, garbled, but vaguely resembling a human voice. As the crew reach the ship, and spend longer on it, it appears that someone or something is toying with them, and more, the question is what has the Event Horizon become? Scary, sharply written and directed, with excellent performances by all, terrific special effects, and a creepy ending. Worth renting.",Null,1,2,7 December 2003
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Not terrible but way below average
","Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up in a Racoon city hospital to discover the deadly T-virus has swept threw the city, turning everything it comes in contact with into ravenous flesh-eating Zombies and genetic mutants. In the right hands, this film really could have been...something, but it was more or less botched by Paul Anderson. I don't hate Anderson, He has lots of potential to make good movies (He proved that with the atmospheric 'Event Horizon', which is no doubt his best film to date)but his love of unrealistic action often destroy his films. First-time director Alexander Witt's directional debut is similar to Anderson's writing--all style, no substance. There's no suspense, no tension, nothing. Just lots of mindless stunts. That brings me to the most annoying fault here. The action! it's non-stop, which is NOT a good thing. There are so many scenes here that were thrown in because the makers knew video-game-obsessed and intellectually-deprived (Sorry, but it's true!) kids would make up the majority of the films audience. Because of this, the rules of the T-virus that were established in the first Resident Evil have been thrown away in favor of more action. The most laughable example is when an entire legion of zombies pop from a graveyard--even when they aren't effected by the T-virus! Good to see the people making films today care so much about not insulting the audience's intelligence, isn't it?Anyways, the acting is wooden by most of the principle cast, the characters are cliché'd typecasts (The tough female lead, the jive-talking' black dude, the deranged scientist, I'm sure there were more but it's already slipping from my mind as I write...) and the 'science'...what little science there WAS behind the T-virus, anyways...was laughable. The special effects range from very good to down-right awful. The Nemesis make-up looked great, the gore effects were well-done and the zombies were alright, but the CGI here...wow, they say that CG effects are getting 'better' these days, what they *really* mean is 'CGI is getting cheaper, so now we can create it faster and not have to put any effort or work or creativity into it'. The ending was just stupid. So, Alice is a god now, huh? Wow, like running down buildings and being able to jump twenty feet in the air and not getting even singed by flames during an explosion (Aided only by a fire blanket) isn't enough, now she can kill people by just looking at them! This was a dumb, mindless movie with no brains, no atmosphere, nothing but action scene after action scene. It's part of the of the further degradation of Hollywood today.3/10, though that's a little bit TOO generous...",3,2,4,6 February 2005
From Dusk Till Dawn," Clever and off-beat but by no means a masterpiece
","After going on a murderous killing spree, Two brothers, Seth and Richard, hide out with a family of hostages in a remote, seedy bar in Mexico. Unfortunately, the bar they picked happens to be run by blood-thirsty vampires, and if they want to escape, they will have to work with they're hostages to live through the night. I remember hearing a lot of hype about this film back when it first came out in 96', and even though I am a avid horror fan, I just got around to seeing the movie now. I honestly don't know what to think of this filmthe first half is a Quentin Tarantino-style crime romp, with his usual trademark sense of off-beat humor. Then the second half of the film: Blood, gore, monsters, blood, gore, monsters, more blood, gore, monstersI think you get the picture.It's certainly enjoyable and funny in that the characters, Tarantino's especially, are funny and likable, and the script, penned by Tarantino himself, is witty, clever and often imaginative. The actors all do a great job too; I loved Harvey Keitel's dead-pan delivery and Mr. Clooney is his usual sly self.Then, of course we have what the film was designed forthe gore and monsters. The boys at KNB effects deserve a pat on the back for they're contribution here. The creature effects were great and the gore was over-the-top but convincing and plentiful as hell. Unfortunately, this film was made during the digital boom so some pretty lame 'morphing' effects were employed for the scenes where vampires melt after being killed, but this is only a small complaint.If you like gore or off-beat horror films, you'll probably enjoy this film, just remember to turn your brain off before watching it. On the whole it was pretty entertaining.6.5/10.",6,1,2,3 August 2005
Saw," One of the most disturbing films I've ever seen
","A demonic serial killer (Okay, so he's not REALLY a serial killer, but) imprisons two average men (Carey Elwes and Leigh Whannell) in a rather unpleasant bathroom in an ancient, long-deserted sewage plant. Things go from bad to worse for them when they realize that the intent of the said killer is for them to turn on one another and ultimately, kill one another. Wow. How can I describe a film like 'saw'? Brutal, disturbing, grisly, unpleasant I think you get the picture. Elwes and Whannell (Who also scripted the film) both give excellent performances, but more importantly, we care about the characters, they're engaging and realistic, usually in this type of film I find myself not caring at all for the characters, that isn't so here, though. The characters are well-rounded and likable. I WANTED them to survive.This is James Wan's first big feature film, and he delivers everything here with extreme intensity, style, and atmosphere. The cinematography was superb and I loved the ways some of the flashbacks were filmed. The guy's got a great eye for detail and I'm sure we'll be hearing more from him soon. This is no Disney film, folks, in case you haven't guessed. Not only is it extremely gory at times, but the situations are so unsettling and mean-spirited that if the film hadn't been gory, it still would have earned every bit of it's R rating (come to think about it, this is probably the most physiologically disturbing film I've ever seen!). In my opinion, the ending was absolutely terrifying. I won't give it away, but it's easily the most twisted, ironic and anticlimactic ending I've ever seen. Yes, I'll admit, I did loose some sleep over it.'Saw' is a flick that wasn't designed with the faint-of-heart in mind. It ruthless, brutal, and gruesome, but it's easily the most powerful and disturbing films I've ever seen.8/10.",10,1,2,28 February 2005
The Descent," Haunting and powerful, what horror can and should be.
","I just got back from a midnight screening of the film and let me tell you that I am greatly satisfied by what I saw. This is a film with a simple plot and a limited cast that draws it's strength from its intensity. And intense it is! The last half of the film is brilliantly executed. Neil Marshall knows the genre well. The dynamic range of his camera--from epic, Peter Jackson-esquire aerial photography to the tight, narrow, womb-like confides of the cave setting--make brilliant contrasts. He also knows a thing or two about human nature, which plays a huge part in the films success. This film kind of reminds me of the brilliant 1997 sci-fi horror film 'CUBE' in that it shows that even protagonists--the best of humanity, if you will--can become feral, murderous creatures under pressure. Add to this an often great music score by David Julyan, solid and entirely believable characters and performances all-around, and carnage that even the most demanding horror fan will be pleased by, the Descent is a terrific little horror film that does not disappoint. Like the aforementioned CUBE, the ending--not the cropped US ending, which is missing the last climactic scene but the real ending we will hopefully get on DVD--is uncertain and bleak, and will follow you for a long time. I just sat there when the film was over. It was a profoundly impacting horror flick, and in a day and age when unoriginality reigns king of the genre, 'The Descent' is a gem in a coal mine.",10,3,7,5 August 2006
Cube," One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time.
","Seven different people, each from a very different walk of life, awaken to find themselves inside a giant cube with thousands of possible rooms. Each has a skill that becomes clear when they must band together to get out: a cop, a math wiz, a building designer, a doctor, an escape master, and a disabled man. Each plays a part in their thrilling quest to find answers as to why they've been imprisoned.I rented this having heard good things but not knowing what to expect and it turned out to be one of the most original and intelligent film I've seen in a long time. Vincenzo Natali (Remember this name, it'll be big one day!)does a fantastic job with the atmosphere, suspense and tension. I kept guessing (Wrong, naturally) what great new plot twist would be introduced into the story. The cast of character actors help the story greatly. Most people who don't like 'Cube' blame the actors; I disagree. I thought the cast did a great job, especially David Hewlett, Andrew Miller and Wayne Robson. The characters were great and well-rounded enough to be real people, not the product of a writer's imagination. While most sci-fi films now-a-days try to wow you with unconvincing computer-generated special effects, 'Cube' relies on thought-provoking dialouge and characters. That's not to say that the effects in the film aren't good (In fact, for a film made for so little money, many of them were quite excellent.), but there not 'In-your-face' and meld into the story perfectly. Mark Korven's score was excellent. It's atmospheric, void of melody, but it's extremely effective and haunting. Why isn't the score available commercially? I want it!!!The ending was PERFECT. Sure, it leaves you with an intense 'What? That's it?' feeling, but that's whats so great about it, the makers avoided the urge to tell us every detail and leave most of it up to our imagination.'Cube' is a brilliant piece of low-budget film-making. It's haunting, intelligent, well-made. If you've seen 'Cube', I recommend you read the books 'House of stairs' by William Sealtor and 'House of doors' by Brian Lumley, both have remarkable similarities to this film. 10/10.ABOUT THE DVD: This DVD review is based on the old (And apparently now defunct) Trimark DVD, not the more recent Lion's gate signature DVD. I may right a review of that DVD at a later point in time. The picture in 'Cube' is presented in a decent widescreen format. I noticed several minor problems while watching the film, including softness (This is especially noticeable during the scenes in the red cubes),edge enhancement,pressing artifacts and bland flesh tones. Otherwise, this ain't a bad picture,with bright colors and minimal grain. The ultra-stereo sound is great.Surround sound effects are well-used, plentiful and effective, with clear and crisp dialouge. There are some great extras on the disc, including a commentary with star Hewlett, director Natali and co-writer Andre Bijelic. This is a fun, enjoyable and informative track. The three talk about how they conceptualized the film and behind-the-scenes stories, among other things. Next up are three deleted scenes, and even though there shown in there 'Rough-cut' form, there still pretty interesting. Natali provides an optional commentary for these scenes. Also included here are story boards (Some of which offer a scene comparison), effects art-work, production design sketches, a theatrical trailer and french and Spanish (But strangely no available English) subtitles. My rating for the DVD: 8.5/10.",10,0,2,13 November 2004
