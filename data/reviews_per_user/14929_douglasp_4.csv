The Ring," The Perfect Horror Movie
","The American adaptation of the Ring is the perfect horror movie, or at least as close to perfect as Hollywood has yet come.The number one ingredient in a horror film is:  Ta Da!  The horror!  And is logic and reason horrifying?  No!  Logic and reason are the opiates we impose upon the random chaos we call our lives in order to not succumb to the horror of the dream-like chaos our lives really are.I think American horror is all too often comforting.  Bad things happen, but there is always a way to rationalize it.  There are a few American films that break this mold.  When I watched the re-release of the Exorcist in 2000, seeing it for the first time without commercials, I realized that what made it so scary was the movie made no sense.  There were suggestions of what might be going on with little Regan, but until late in the film, we are never really sure.  And then there's no real reason a little girl should have to suffer like this.This is the essence of horror.  And this is what the Ring offers!  I was amazed and highly disturbed as I watched this film.  The film is a nightmare on celluloid, or DVD in my case, and its Evil is not ashamed of being evil. In fact, it revels in it.  The movie even toys with the expectations of the viewer.At least, I was led to believe that things were winding down to a disappointing Spielbergian ending, but then Zap-Zot-Zowie, the film smacks me in the face with a wooden chair.  And I never even saw it coming.I haven't seen the Japanese original yet, but I look forward to it.  If you have read this far in my review and haven't seen the movie yet, shame on you.  You are cheating yourself out of a virtual nervous breakdown.",Null,1,1,11 March 2003
Being John Malkovich," The funniest horror movie ever made!
","Being John Malkovich is possibly the funniest horror movie of all time.  It is a very disturbing exploitation comedy in the vein of Olga's Girls about a man who's head is invaded by a bunch of loser head cases who do not know how to live their own lives.Eventually, a hippie-wannabe-puppeteer who is in lustful competition with his New Age wife for the affections of the evil Maxine, takes over John Malkovich's body instead of just indulging in voyeurism like the other head cases.The hippie puppeteer wins both John Malkovich's and the evil Maxine's bodies for a while, but is he too big a looser to hold onto them?  Are there other sinister forces that want to make John Malkovich their own?  Will no one come to John Malkovich's aid?Being John Malkovich is a very sick, very funny movie that would raise cries of protest from the usual suspects if instead of a middle-aged, white, bald guy, the victim were, say, Xenia Seeberg or Neve Campbell.But, because of the humor, philosophizing, and fully-clothed sex scenes, few people will be aware of the nature of the film they are viewing.",Null,0,1,12 August 2001
Moulin Rouge!," All the effects of a hangover without any of the fun
","This movie claims to be dedicated to the bohemian ideals of truth, beauty, freedom, and above all else, love.  It is probably dedicated to these ideals because it is so utterly bereft of any of them.Truth -- it is a work set in 1899, yet its music comes from modern day pop songs.  If you want to see an original, good musical, see the episode of Lexx entitled Brigadoom.Beauty --  To paraphrase Wendell Lawson (only because I can't find the exact quote):  It looks like something Walt Disney threw up.Freedom --  Okay, maybe there is some semblance of a yearning for freedom in this film, but I can't really tell.Love -- If your idea of love includes manipulation, coercion, deception, and mammon, then it has it in spades.Okay, I don't know anything about bohemians, and I don't really care, but if you want to see a film that embodies real ideals of truth, beauty, freedom, and above all, love, then see Life is Beautiful.But, if your goal is to slosh your brain around without consuming alcohol, this will get you a hangover sized headache within twenty minutes.Whatever you choose, good luck!",2,1,3,16 June 2002
Joy," Garbage
","This movie is complete and utter garbage.This 'true story' is completely fabricated and faker than the soap opera scenes that intersperse this movie. What's worse is the director knew he was making a garbage film but because it contained two stars he worked with in American Hustle he just kept throwing in references to other, superior films, such as Taxi Drive and Citizen Kane.There is so much here that violates the laws of the suspension of disbelief, for instance, somehow the restroom has a secret door blocked by a few boxes that lead into the main manufacturing plant that holds the smoking gun that Joy's plans are being stolen.Joy has to hire a plumber and then suddenly her bed-ridden mom who only watches soap operas is cavorting around the house with the Haitian plumber offering bowls of soup to Joy. For no reason. They just interrupt the scene.Everything about this film is stupid and insulting. There are B-movies made in the 1950s that have more integrity and artistic merit. This whole film is a sell-out on the highest order and a class action lawsuit should be filed so that people who paid actual money to see this disaster could get some compensation.There are many times where I, as the viewer, wished that Jenifer Lawrence had a bow and arrow and could go Katniss Everdeen on the rest of the characters.Bradley Cooper seemed like he was reciting lines in a hypnotic trance. In fact, the whole cast seemed as if they were under some somnambulist's spell, robotically reciting lines that had been poured into their heads by some careless programmer, ambivalent of how his automatons performed. As if by some government worker who would get paid regardless of the quality of his work.There is nothing redeeming here. There is no quality. There is no charm. Everyone was tasked to do a job and no matter how bad it was, they were just going to get through.",1,20,42,7 May 2016
