Selma," Great civil rights movie
",This movie should be shown in history classes because it was accurate following Martin Luther King Jr and his peaceful protests towards civil rights. even after the events of this movie people kept fighting for civil rights.and eventually got it in the end.,9,0,3,1 March 2019
Thirteen Days," The entire movie was great
","This movie was one of the best historical movies I have seen. I personally would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone I knew. I have not seen any other movies that take place during this time period but I love the history of the period so I would watch more movies that take place then. Roger Donaldson is a great director but I have not seen any of his other films. I have seen many of Kevin Costner's films and I love him in all of them, he is a great actor. I liked the entire movie it was tense just like the time and overall it was great. I would have watched this movie outside of school and I would definitely recommend it to my friends",8,1,2,13 February 2019
Back to the Future," Great classic movie
",I have watched this movie many times and will continue to watch it many more times. this is my favorite time travel comedy movie and will continue to be. this movie did a really great job portraying the 80s from its language to its sets. the other Back to the Futures where also as good as this one. there was nothing not to like about the movie it was so great overall. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone that has or hasn't seen it.,9,0,0,13 February 2019
