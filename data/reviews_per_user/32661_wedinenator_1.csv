Requiem for a Dream," Life changing movie that takes the glamor and glory out of drugs
","This is one of the only movies, involving drugs, that doesn't send a message that drugs are 'cool'. It sounds stupid to say but after becoming a drug addict and then becoming clean, I realized how much society, movies, music, etc. can glorify drugs into something their not. Every time I watch this movie(and i've seen it at least 20 times) I cant take my eyes off the screen. It takes you so far into the emotions and stressful lives of addicts that by the end of the movie, and even the next day or the next week for some, you are so thankful you are not in their position. Also the contrast between the addictions of someone who's chosen the path(Jared Leto and friends) and someone who was led blindly into the trap is what, for me, makes it so amazing. I've seen other movies based on addictions, and I'm sure you have too, but none that show the helpless side of someone being blindly led down that path. Ellen Burstyn's character is so deep and crafted so well by the writers and the actress herself that you really feel for her. I'm not one to say drugs are bad and what not, but its true, some of our society paints them to be something there not. But this movie shows what can happen to anybody. A great movie, but I will say I don't recommend it to the faint of heart or someone looking for a feel good movie.",8,1,2,3 September 2007
