Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Horrible excuse for a movie!
","I'm a registered IMDb user for a couple of years now and I never felt I should submit any comments, but I also never saw such an immense discrepancy between the score of a movie and its true value. I can't believe it's not in the top 50 worst movies ever made. I rarely felt so strongly I wasted time after seeing a movie. Borat's childish toilet humor and its huge score can only lead me to believe that the majority of people that voted don't know what humor or real cinematography are. I can't believe that this array of meaningless scenes were so heavily promoted. A 84 minutes torture that NO ONE with a gram of intellect should be able to stand.",1,7,15,25 January 2007
Star Trek," Star Trek is finally cool
","Stunning revamp from all perspectives. While I don't have any costumes or figurines, I did see all series and I must say they managed to fill the major gaps in previous series. Meeting and exceeding expectations on the long needed visual upgrade, J.J. Abrams has managed to find the perfect balance of humor, wit, and sci-fi goodness while bringing the ST universe to another level. Watching this made me be excited about the future of the franchise. Fingers crossed for the remake of the original series!A word of warning for those of you that loathed ST. If you go to this movie, you will feel a strange and strong urge of watching all series. You have been warned!",8,4,14,7 May 2009
