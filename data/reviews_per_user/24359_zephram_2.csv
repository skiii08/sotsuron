Requiem for a Dream," Profoundly disturbing, utterly brilliant
","Darren Aronofsky proves he is no one-hit-wonder in this profoundly disturbing, utterly brilliant film about drugs, sex and the value of human life. Based on the Hubert Selby Jr novel of the same name, Requiem for a Dream explores the hopes and aspirations of the downtrodden of New York's Coney Island, their downward spiral to oblivion and ultimate penance for the sin of addiction. Whilst at points uncomfortable, in others dull, Requiem succeeds in intimating us with its central characters, allowing us to empathise with their every disappointment, to weep for their irreversible mistakes. A simply unforgettable experience that is seared in to the audiences' collective consciousness, Requiem for a Dream is a potent weapon in the fight against drugs.(A note: There is an R rated version that was released on VHS and in many cinemas that butchers this movie (in particular the closing scenes). The US unrated, uncut version of this movie is the only one suitable for viewing)",Null,0,1,22 October 2001
Mulholland Drive," Weird, Disturbing, Disjointed, Brilliant
","David Lynch has confirmed himself the master of modern cinema in this weird, disturbing, disjointed, brilliant Film Noir. A film that takes such outmoded conventions as linear narrative and hurls them violently out the Window, Mulholland Drive is an exploration of conscious and subconscious that will leave you troubled and confused, but ultimately fulfilled as you piece together this pasticcio of one girl's memory (or justification for murder?). A veritable treatise on modern film, Lynch runs concurrent stories with overlapping characters that may or may not be related, fascination cultural cross-sections, seemingly meaningless asides, creepy porn-theater opera and the world's only Film Noir cowboy, and molds them in to a piece of cinema that critics will love or loathe, but that cinema buffs are required to see 4.5/5 Stars.",10,2,2,19 April 2002
