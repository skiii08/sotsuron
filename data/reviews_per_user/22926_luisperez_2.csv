Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Amazing
","Kill Bill 2 is absolutely amazing. Quentin Tarantino's story is great in every aspect and with this last movie confirms all the things that I ever thought about him and that's the fact that he is one of the best directors of the world ever. I had seen all of his movies and definitely this is the best of all. Kill Bill is creative, beautiful, refreshing and above all spectacular! The idea of splitting the movie in half was brilliant and really makes you be impatient to see what's going happened next. Kill Bill 2 wasn't as great in terms of action as the first one but the story is absolutely amazing and unexpected. This is the best film of the year so long. You must see this movie as quickly as you can. Great!",9,0,1,25 May 2004
The Matrix," One of the best films I've ever seen!
","The Matrix is absolutely amazing. When I saw it for the first time about 4 years ago, I was impress by the argument, story, characters, special effects and many more things. I believe that no others movie has such an important influence on the movie industry like this one. The Matrix changes for ever the way how we see movies nowadays. I have already see all the trilogy of the Matrix and I can confess that I'm a real fan of the series(the first one I've already seen it about 10 times, the second about 5 times and the last 3 times!). I really recommend this film to all of those who likes video games, computers, internet. because, in a way, alert us to the dangers of the continuous growing of our dependence of the machines.",10,0,1,29 November 2003
