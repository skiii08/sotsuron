Marie Antoinette," Gorgeous photography, lousy script
","Marie Antoinette is a visually stunning, lushly photographed movie with gorgeous costumes, sets and natural scenes. The costumes alone must have cost about $20 million. Some of the scenes are so extraordinary they would make beautiful paintings to hang on the wall. For those virtues it would get 10 stars. Unfortunately, the pace is glacially slow, the acting wooden or worse, and the script, awful. I checked a biography of Marie Antoinette, and the story is true to her life in many regards. Too bad she was a pampered, spoiled brat whose life, and that of her court, was full of the stifling trivial activities we saw in the film: eating dainties, being fitted for new gowns and shoes, playing dice and cards, and gossiping with the girls. None of this makes for interesting drama. Kirsten Dunst plays her as a sweet girl, misjudged by others, but basically a simp. The life of Marie and Louis XVI was just not interesting enough to make a movie about them, except possibly their dramatic end game where they were imprisoned and beheaded, neither of which is included in this film. Dunst is a pretty young woman but an actress who delivers the petty lines of this script like an amateur. Jason Schwartzman, as her dauphin, is even worse. He sounds like a junior high school student in his first drama class.Comparison with the movie Elizabeth (1998), starring Cate Blanchett immediately comes to mind. Now that was a fine movie! Blanchett's top-notch acting brought Elizabeth I of England to life as a sweet young woman who survived mayhem to rapidly grow into a shrewd leader who could protect herself and use the men around her to her advantage.",5,2,3,26 October 2006
The Prestige," A mess of a movie, in my opinion.
","What comes to mind immediately in reviewing The Prestige, is a comparison to a similar, but far superior movie, The Illusionist. The Illusionist had it all: a great story with a complex but credible plot, great characters (especially Edward Norton as the Illusionist), and a thoroughly satisfying conclusion. The scenes of magic were extraordinary and creepy, transporting the viewer back to the world of a master conjuror's stage in the year 1900. By contrast, The Prestige had a silly, trivial plot that just kept repeating the schtick of two magicians who were rivals for no purpose, unimpressive 'tricks' on the stage, and the preposterous Tesla device that duplicated everything like a surreal photocopy machine. The movie also took huge liberties, jumping around in time: one minute D'Anton was in London, and the next in Colorado, multiple times. Played fast and loose with parallel universes and time travel, I guess.I kept thinking, do I really care enough to watch the end of this movie? And why is Scarlett Johansen always typecast as a temptress/floozy? She looked like the early 20th century version of the character she played in Match Point, another loser of a movie.",3,5,13,14 December 2007
Avatar," Great special effects, hackneyed story.
","Well, I saw Avatar when it first came out in late 2009. At the time I was blown away by the special effects -- the inside of the space ship, the environment on the beleaguered planet etc. I did like Sam Worthington as the protagonist, but he didn't have enough to do. The story always left me dissatisfied. It seemed so simplistic and silly -- bad guy military type trying to 'conquer' the noble savages on some planet. Noble savages with too many resemblances to old-timey American Indians. How overdone and how unimaginative. In fact, this was in a lot of ways so much like James Cameron's other 'epic' film, Titanic, which had one of the stupidest plots of the last 50 years. Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet, 1990's 'teens' disguised as 1912 look-alikes who slogged through freezing water for about 100 hours (and then he dies). Arrggh. Avatar was too much like this and and in the end, I just hated this movie. I even read how the people who made this movie were sitting around struggling to cobble together the plot. It shows in how lame it turned out to be.",3,2,4,10 January 2014
Titanic," What a pile of crap.
","Having read real accounts of the Titanic disaster from eyewitnesses, as in Walter Lord's stellar book A Night to Remember, I can only laugh at how ludicrous James Cameron's rendition of this historical event was. All for sensationalism and turned into a mega-soap opera. Focusing on the plight of two 1990's teenagers decked out in costumes as if they inhabited 1912 but nobody was fooled. The whole thing was ludicrous as they slogged their way for hours in freezing ocean water in soaked clothing, ending up in the ocean of course -- but only she was saved. The only good part of this movie 'disaster' was the first few minutes where they showed the salvage operation on the real Titanic.",2,8,14,10 January 2014
Marriage Story," Didn't quite get there. Seemed artificial and unsatisfying.
","I had heard such rave comments about this movie, I wanted it to be fantastic. (I don't watch many movies anymore, but this one attracted me by some of the reviews I read). Instead, I found the movie unsatisfying and somewhat boring, actually. I did not feel that the flame war between the divorcing couple (and between their attorneys!) was either compelling or realistic, more annoying and repetitive than anything else. The acting was competent, but a bit over the top for my taste.
The premise: couple still has affection for each other, but there's too much baggage, so they have to separate. They are both intelligent, so it's unbelievable that the wife wouldn't have communicated her dissatisfaction long before, and also that the husband would be so clueless as not to notice there were issues.
They are both overly consumed with getting custody of their son - it's their only important goal apparently. In the real world this could have been worked out as a joint custody agreement, regardless of where the parents chose to live. The first half of the movie seemed brilliant, then it dropped the ball. Nasty fight between the couple and between their attorneys. The guy caves in; gives up his career and moves to LA because his ex-wife wants it. She is an insufferable whiner. And a corny ending of their son finally learning to read at the age of 8 - what, he's a dyslexic? And what does he read? The blurb from the beginning of the movie where the wife wrote down all the things she loved about her 'soon to be ex' husband. How cute? Not. A cheap and cheesy cop-out ending.",4,0,1,21 January 2020
