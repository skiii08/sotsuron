The Blair Witch Project," Imagination is key
","This movie scared the heck out of me. What surprises me is that people I know who are scared watching any horror film thought this movie was boring. I believe a wild imagination is necessary to truly get this film. What scared me about this movie is what my imagination was doing every step of the way. What was happening while they were sleeping? What was happening when they heard screaming of their friend when he went missing? What was making those banging noises and why? Because this film does not show anything horrific, it is up to the viewer to fill in the missing spaces and this is what frightened me. I am sure what was going on in my mind could not have been portrayed in a film and still received an 'R' rating. The unknown and what could be happening is what made this film frightening. And the true horror in the eyes and voices of the filmmakers in this film more than reinforced my worst fears. Overall, this film did something that has not happened to me since I was about 10 years old. It made me afraid of the dark and of the strange noises in nature that we hear every day.",Null,0,1,3 September 2011
