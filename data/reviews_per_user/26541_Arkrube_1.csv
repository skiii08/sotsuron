Walk the Line," Oscar WORTHY x2
","I have seen this movie twice; each time it was moving and believable. If this movie was based on fiction it would still be considered an excellent work in film.Witherspoon and Phoenix are Oscar worthy by all means of measurement. I saw Phoenix in Gladiator and was impressed with his acting in that particular film. Phoenix not only is the subject of the story, but through his nonverbals, physical demeanor, and his acting skills he becomes an integral part of the story-telling. The bit with 'Sam Phillips' telling Johnny Cash that he had to believe in himself sums up the position that Phoenix assumed when he undertook this acting role. Phoenix and Witherspoon are believable and this movie serves as a reminder that life isn't always pretty.NOW GO SEE IT!",10,0,1,1 December 2005
