Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Thank You Tarantino...
","I used to like him.. now i start to love him.. this work is a true and monumental piece of art for me...the philosophical background says lots of new things every time I watch this movie(s).. there are lots of things to say but one thing i d like to say..'We are not what we know.. we are just what we are..' I think, Tarantino would not talk about what he aimed to say..creator of this monumental work shall not talk about it..it is there standing.. Thank you Tarantino..",10,1,2,2 May 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," work of ART???
","If I had never watched a movie in my lifetime, this might be so.. however it is not so. I haven't read its book and my words are not for its source, but this is a boring film with lots of conflicts.. the only thing looked nice was the city design and some war scenes.. but these does not make something a movie.. People who read the book around me forced me to see the imagination of the writer? Sorry but is this an imagination? :) The good who is weak but handsome always beats the BAD who looks very strong and having all the advantages.. it was also interesting to watch the adventures of the cut on Frodo's face :)) I m  very surprised to see this movie almost at the top of list..",2,0,4,24 February 2004
