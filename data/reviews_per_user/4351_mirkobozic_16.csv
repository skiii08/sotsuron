The Legend of Bagger Vance," The perfect stroke
","The Legend of Bagger Vance is one of those movies that are all about feeling good and inspiring messages all of which we have seen a trillion times before.: Chocolat, You've got Mail, etc. Yet, it kind of works and Redford succeeds in persuading you to stay till the ending credits though the core of the story is not a romantic plot but rather the personal development of the Matt Damon's character Junuh. Will Smith's character Bagger Vance comes to his rescue as a mysterious, yet charismatic caddie who helps him regain not only his self-confidence but also his status. The film is interwoven with magical realism of Vance, although there's not much more to him than delivering motivational speeches and puzzling everyone regarding where he came from and why he's on Junuh's side in the first place. A large part of the charm of the film is the beautiful setting of Savannah, and a very luscious Charlize Theron playing a glamorous local socialite who incites the exhibition golf match around which the whole story is revolving. With all this, it's a light , inspiring afternoon entertainment in a stylish package. You probably won't regret seeing it, but it's not exactly on par with equally feel-good vehicles like Forrest Gump. To paraphrase Vance, it's not exactly the perfect strike, but it goes in the right direction (pun intended).",7,4,5,8 June 2018
Knives Out," Don't believe the haters!
","Here we have-again- the perfect example of a great film being undermined by haters who regard the flm from the perspective of his work on the Star Wars franchise. Let's get this out of the way and let me make clear that the only good parts of the franchise-according to me-are the original trilogy with Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. So I presume that the lowest ratings here were from the SW fan community. 'Knives out' turns out to be a mix of 'The Royal Tannenbaums' and 'Hercule Poirot's Christmas'. Just like Meghan Markle who's in for a lifetime of unnecessary comparisons with Diana, you'll inevitably-if subconsciously- compare Craig to David Suchet. Here we have a rich patriarch in his mansion cramped full with all sorts of exotic paraphernalia; a dysfunctional family, each with his own motif to do away with Dad. He is brilliantly portrayed by Christopher Plummer, determined and clear-minded even in the face of his own demise. The only one who seems to genuinely care for him is his immigrant nurse Marta Cabrera, and after the will is read, it turns into a witch-hunt against the unexpected beneficiary of Harlan's fortune. There are delightful details, like the ornamental assemblage of knives in the background of the chair in which members of the family are seated during the questioning. There's Benoit Blanc , a dapper detective on his own quest for the culprit. He's played by Daniel Craig who clearly enjoys showing us his capability for comedy and something beyond James Bond. Cabrera's inability to tell a lie without throwing up is at once brilliant and cliche, but her overall performance shines throughout the whole film-not that she lacks in serious adversaries, like the larger-than-life Jamie Lee Curtis, a charismatic businesswoman who proudly exclaims she 'built her business from the ground up', which her son Ransom (a handsome and funny Chris Evans) dismisses as a million-dollar loan from Grandpa (a subtle nod to Trump). Harlan's attempt to discredit his flesh and blood as blood-sucking losers is also a challenge for the the viewer-albeit not a really difficult one, but that's not really the point here. The mystery is like a baklava, layered in parallel mysteries to be deciphered. Daniel Craig isn't David Suchet-but on the other hand-he doesn't attempt it anyway, and we can see that he did succeed to build an autonomous, authentic persona, admittedly with a much more pronounced inclination to humor. Which is definitely a good thing. The perfect example of this is a scene where he informs Ransom that his 'ancestral' family home was in reality purchased by Grandpa in the 1980s. 'Knives Out' is definitely value for money, whatever the haters say. Let's hope more directors will tap into whodunnits. Not just because I have a soft spot for Poirot and Sherlock.Don't believe the haters!",10,7,36,25 November 2019
Home Alone," Kevin's home run
","Over the years, this kind of became the comedic equivalent of eggnog, gingerbread and the Nutcracker. It's tedious during any other time of the year, but it works perfectly well come late December. This was the one and probably the last time that anyone fancied Macaulay Culkin as an actor, who developed from Michael Jackson's homebuddy to a thespian has-been with alcoholic issues and managed to emerge from it only a short while ago. However, it's a pleasure to watch him in his acting prime (however sad that may sound). Here he's the cute little Kevin who gets left behind at home when his family goes on a Christmas trip to Paris. Two burglars eventually notice that he's all alone in the big house and they decide to have a go at it. They're taken by surprise when they run straight into the trap of the sadistic kid who turns their effort into a hilarious near-death experience. The comedies nowadays don't really reach the quality level like this one. It doesn't insult my inteligence and the message isn't ironic or too tacky, apart from the over-the-top Christmas decor that looks as if the Rockefeller Christmas tree exploded inside. The pranks Kevin pulls on them are plain silly and the huge family looks like an embodiment of a Norman Rockwell painting, exaggerated to borderline cult. This movie spawned numerous sequels but it's only the two with Culking that are really fun to watch. the plot is simple, the pranks are silly and the whole thing works just because the context of it is undemanding. Just like Culkin's one-character hit, this is a one-time movie and that's why it's likable and so enduring. That's unlikely to change any time soon.",8,0,0,24 December 2018
Spotlight," Revealing, touching, courageous
","'Spotlight' is based on a real-life story surrounding the scandalous reveals of decade-long hushed-up affairs of sexual abuse in the Boston bishopric conducted by the reporters of the Boston Globe. The hot-potato-topic is an important addition to the already global critical discourse regarding pedophilia in the Catholic Church and a condemnation of its practice of merely removing child molesting priests to other parishes. The portraits of victims, already formed adults with families or single, gay or straight, but with the common characteristic of suffering badly under the suppressed trauma of the abuse, are both touching and revealing. It shows how deep you need to dig to find the source of suffering in a person, and how a fear of stigmatization can turn a person into a psychological mess, whereas the real culprits remain unpunished. In many communities, the Church plays a central role in terms of social life or can even be the only way out of peril for destitute people and children from troubled backgrounds. Which makes exposing the very people who help you as monsters in disguise even harder, bordering on unbearable. Coming from a country heavily influenced by religious institutions, I know how it feels to try to speak up against them and to feel the herds of their brainwashed flock coming at you.Mark Ruffalo and Liev Shreiber did a great job here, and quite unexpectedly, the movie earned a best pic Oscar. An upside of the film could be that, similarly like in Burnt, we see a very accurate description of work dynamics in a newspaper HQ, with the difference of the former happening in a restaurant kitchen. If there's anything one could point at as a flaw, it's the fact that the film borders on documentary in terms of style and you can't help thinking it could be reduced to a 45-minute long doc on sexual abuse scandals in the Catholic church, with no losses in terms of its effect on the viewer.",8,1,2,4 April 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Fargo-minus the snow
","Frances McDormand seems to be the perfect cast for tough women with a mission, which goes both for Fargo and this one. Technically, when it comes to character, you could almost describe this as Fargo minus the snow. McDormand plays Mildred, an embittered woman on a quest to find her daughter's murderer. When the local police makes no progress, she decides to take things into her own hands and upsets everyone in the little town of Ebbing along the way, especially through the provocative red billboards asking questions that sheriff Willoughby(Woody Harrelson) isn't really trying to solve the case at all. The movie turns into a gallery of colorful characters, from the man who rents Mildred the billboards, to James (Peter Dinklage), a midget who put Mildred into her place at a dinner date that wrong. Although it's Sam Rockwell's cop Dixon who a wins you over quite easily, it's his beer-drinking mother who is left the biggest impression on me as the archetype of white trash almost bordering on comedy.",10,2,7,21 February 2018
The Devil Wears Prada," Where's my coffee? ;)
","The adaptation of the bestseller 'The Devil Wears Prada' boasts Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway and Emily Watson in the roles of Miranda Priestly, the almighty editor of the Runway magazine with a penchant for sadism, and her two assistants (Hathaway and Watson) who are all about trying to stay in her good book, to the extent of doing absolutely ridiculous tasks that border on sweatshop-style exploitation. Anne Hathaway continues her habit of makeover roles with Andy, the fashion-unconscious intern at Priestly's office who has Emily (Watson) sitting at the desk across from hers, throwing passive- aggressive insults at her all the time. The film is definitely worth checking out not just for Priestly's hilarious antics but also for Stanley Tucci's Nigel, the dramatic stylist who helps Andy with her make-over. The writing is brilliant, with good quips and a couple of great monologues from Tucci and Streep, whose speech on the influence of fashion on those who ignore it is very much on point. The bad part of the movie-although expected-is the fact that it's more or less like a film-length product placement, and the very antiquated notion that you need to abandon your career in order to satisfy your partner's vision of what's appropriate for you. But hey, to paraphrase Tucci, we're all in desperate need of Chanel, after all.",7,0,1,21 November 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," What goes around at the Blue Oyster, comes back at the Bohemian Rhapsody
","Freddie Mercury is one of those that simply provoke a reaction, you just can't be indifferent to Queen. This movie proves why that's the case- the music, the charisma, the comraderie with the others from the band (Brian May was also brilliantly portrayed). As far as biopics go, Bohemian Rhapsody hit the nail on the head, the band's chemistry is credibly transferred to the big screen, and Malek really was the perfect lead choice. But. Mercury's charisma went far beyond the music, he was a flamboyant and emotionally expressive guy who flaunted his sexuality as an important part of his image. This is where the film begins to turn sour. His life-long close relationship with Mary Austin isn't delivered very credibly, perhaps because one is constantly distracted by the fake theeth and the horrible accent, and I had a hard time believing there was any real chemistry between the two if judged by the movie only. And then, even worse, Mercury the Queen, whose over-the-top sexuality is reduced to a walking clichÃ©: a curious peek at a truck driver (really?!) outside a public loo (imagine parents explaining to their kids what 'cottaging' is) and a scene or two depicting a leather-clad Sodoma and Gomorrah in a gay club, comically resembling the Blue Oyster from Police Academy. 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is far from homophobic, but its problem is a stereotypical depiction of 1980's gay scene that borders on offensive. Fortunately, the end with the Live Aid gig is a masterpiece, and touchingly, we see both Mary Austin and Tim Hutton standing next to each other, bringing the story to full circle as two equally important people in Mercury's life.",5,3,11,6 November 2018
The Revenant," A breathtaking disappointment
","Leo Di Caprio stars as Hugh Glass, a man who survives a grizzly attack, falling down a waterfall, an attack by the Indians and falling down a cliff (while on his horse) just in order to get back at Fitzgerald(Tom Hardy). This being a Hollywood film, it's not very hard to guess who will have the last laugh, in spite of all the obstacles that one could only survive in CGI. And don't even get me started on Glass' ability to miraculously recover from each near- fatal injury in no time and just keep crawling and panting through snow and ice. Even if one looks past all that (if you want real life, you don't go to a cinema in the first place anyway), the other flaw of the film is that you don't really feel anything for the characters. With everything favoring your sympathies for Glass, he doesn't pull it off, since he hardly say anything for the whole duration of the movie, and his relationship to his son doesn't come off as emotional/warm enough in order to justify going through so much effort to revenge his death. That being said, there's one thing though that I enjoyed immensely- the breathtaking photography that makes you easily fall in love with Canadian forests and mountains. If you ignore the ridiculous plot, this comes off as a true love letter to the marvels of nature and its cruel beauty.",8,16,46,26 December 2015
The White Ribbon," A haunting tale of premonition
","Michael Haneke is one of those directors who deliver tough love. There's no pampering of viewers with too obvious plots, shallow characters or corny humor. 'Das Weisse Band' is a great example of this. Set in a pre-WW1 German village, it's a story about a series of disturbing, seemingly inexplicable events that shake the pious protestant community to its core. Basically, what Haneke does here is a biopsy of the roots of fascism in the human character and its slow but steady community cultivation that may, or may not, explode at a certain point in the future. This is achieved with an immensely subtle approach: there's no mention of Nazis or fascism itself; the narrator of the story itself just says at the beginning that he will try to 'explain some things that happened later' and we're left puzzled until it dawns on us what he actually referred to. In a way, the film is structured with symbols similar to those from Georg Grosz's art, with the main protagonists being referred to only by their function, instead of their name (Priest, Teacher, Baron etc.), which is aimed at showing that this could happen-and has happened- everywhere. The cinematography is remarkably done in b/w and the haunting motif of the white ribbons on the kids' arms seem like a dark premonition of the yellow stars from WW2. The end comes as puzzling as the rest, there's no solution, nor absolution. The world is slowly descending into darkness, and everyone pretends they don't see it. What's more, it seems that we're in a similar situation today, with barbed wires in place of white ribbons. And yet, we didn't learn anything from Haneke, or an another man who showed us the sheer size of unleashed evil, and whose name starts with the same letter. Hitler.",10,1,3,26 December 2015
Ratatouille," The rat pack
","I grew up with Disney's 2D classics like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, the Lion King etc. Either due to growing out of the age of their target audience, or the fact that the aesthetics of Shrek and the like were just too unappealing to me. And then came Ratatouille, a perfect little animated gem by Pixar, which combines two things that are very easy to grow fond of: good food and a good story.
It's a tale of the rat Remy with an overdeveloped sense of smell and taste, who refuses to settle for the usual trash bin menu, and goes on a mission to change his life. When he accidentally meets Linguini, a clumsy garbage boy of a Parisian restaurant, the two form a friendship and Remy helps him advance to the position of the cook, to the displease of the chef Skinner who is suspicious of Linguini's sudden success. The restaurant's original owner, Chef Gusteau, bequeaths the place to Linguini, and when Skinner finds out, a conflict unfolds, until it's discovered who is behind the boy's transformation into a stove genius. The characters have very well developed , distinctive personalities and the chemistry is palpable, especially between Remy and his rat pack (pun intended). The critic Anton Ego has a threatening charisma and it's a pleasure watching him unleash it on restaurant staff and writing about it. However, in the unexpected finale, he delivers a beautiful monologue about food critics, that pretty much sums up the relevance of them. Cooking is a joy, and one to be shared as a means to form friendships. Remy tells us a story of persistance, loyalty and dreams worth fighting for. A pleasure to watch, with excellent voiceovers and animation. Definitely one of those you gladly come back to.",10,0,0,10 January 2019
Jackie," Natalie Portman's tour de force
","I really thought Portman reached the tip of her acting toes with Black Swan, until I saw 'Jackie'. The bad thing about biopics nowadays is that they tend to encompass someone's whole biography, whereas this one ceoncentrates merely on the episode during and immediately after JFK's assasination in Dallas.
The portrayal of the Jackie is unique because it evolves into a trifold story of a first lady, a wife and a woman. The director succeeds in giving each one of them enough space, and along the way pulls down a part of the usual glamourous facade exposing Jackie as a character shattered by her trauma, drowning her insecurities in alcohol. Unfortunately, the film got much less attention than it deserves. I enjoyed it immensely.",10,0,0,5 March 2018
Alice in Wonderland," Nonsense&nonsensibility
","I guess it was just a matter of time before Burton decided to do his own take on Lewis Carroll's classic tale of nonsense&nonsensibility. It's safe to say that production-wise, the whole thing was in the best of hands, since Burton is known for employing characters like those in Carroll's book all the time. The costume department did a magnifficent job- the Hatter and the Red Queen look exactly as one would imagine them to be, with Helena Bonham Carter as the one who takes the cake for the best job in the cast, with her frantic, hysterical antics and hilarious lines. Johnny Depp is becoming increasingly annoying with his constant insistence on quirky characters, personality-and-costumewise. Mia Wasikowska was a good choice for the leading role, with her long blond hair and delicate features. That being said, the one thing that turns all of this into a mess is the fact that Burton tried to 'adapt' the original story to the Hollywood standards and introduce a plot into a book that's famous for a lack of one in the traditional sense. If you go, go for the beautiful details, otherwise a bit of a disappointment.",4,0,0,5 June 2018
Life Is Beautiful," A masterpiece of survival
","A friend of mine, who struggled with overweight issues for most of his life, once said that the only place where he actually managed to lose weight was the concentration camp where he was incarcerated during the 1990s conflict in former Yugoslavia. He fortunately survived, and Roberto Benigni's film isn't far away from that in terms of approach to the subject. it's arguably my favourite war film, due to the unique perspective of the little boy (Giorgio Cantarini) and the gruesome reality that's about to crush him, where his father (Benigni) does his best to prevent him from the horrors of the Holocaust and protect him by turning survival into a game where the boy gets to win a tank if he behaves properly. The viewer is unable to ignore the repercussions of the situation in which the story is unfolding, yet Benigni's direction make the hot potato of the topic at hand much easier to handle. Nicola Piovani's emotional soundtrack hit the right nerve without descending into pathetics. Benigni won two Oscars, which were very well deserved. When he got up to the stage, the great Sophia Loren handed him the award, hugged him and broke down in tears, which is a scene that resonates with me even today. He dedicated the Oscar to 'those who gave their lives so that we can say la vita e bella'. It' impossible to stay cold to that. Bravo, Benigni!",10,0,1,16 March 2018
The Shape of Water," Win some, lose a lot
","If you decide to go and see the movie without any previous knowledge on the plot, you might have a decent time, at least for the first 20 minutes or so. But as the story progresses, your disappointment progresses with it as well. It's no more nor less than Del Toro's take on your classic Beauty and the beast, literally. The beautiful colors, lighting design and scenery tick all the right boxes for the award season (along with the two leading ladies, Octavia Spencer as the forceful cleaner and Sally Field in the main role, as her frail, mute collegue, who threads through life in a touchingly heartwarming way. There's the gay neighbor and the cruel white boss, so we got all the ingredients for a money-shoveling crowd-pleaser. Your sympathies are clearly all the time on the fragile heroine's side, and beyond it, the story is basically completely redundant, with a couple of nude scenes that make up for the utter predictability of the movie.",4,12,30,5 March 2018
Burlesque," Let's go camp-ing!
","When they hit the big screen, musicians tend to rarely show any talent beyond singing. Which is why the scripts usually focus on exactly that, with the plot used as merely a filler between songs. Hence we have Tess (Cher) as the owner of a night club she's trying to save from financial ruin. The former dancer throws in a couple of her own songs for good measure, but when the smalltown girl Ali (Christina Aguilera)starts waitressing at the club and expresses a wish to move from the bar to the stage, Tess says no. Ali turns out to have spectacular pipes, which unexpectedly starts a renaissance of the joint with Ali as the star of the show, who gains a grudge with the dancer Nikki and finds a friend in Sean( Stanley Tucci, who, once again, plays the gay assitant). I don't remember the guy in a straight role. Cam Gigandet as the bar tender is walking eye candy and Ali's roommate. The story, of course, is ridiculous and so full of cliches that it's hardly difficult where the whole thing is headed. 'Burlesque' is an escapist sugarbubble that's offends only those with enough movie experience to see that this vehicle is like a huge salad of combined rip-offs, like Footloose, Cabaret and Chicago. Cher is desperately trying to convince us she's got more than that one facial expression and, rather unsuccessfully, that she didn't pay for it. Christina is performance-wise certainly much closer to Jeniffer Beals than Liza Minelli, but even that's an exaggeration. The final verdict would be that this is clearly aimed at Cher's fan-base, and since there's a lot of them, unfortunately it seems that didn't necessarily translate to the box office. This might work as a part of a karaoke or a sing-along, otherwise, stay away from it.",3,1,3,4 January 2019
Murder on the Orient Express," Semi-successful but visually impressive.
","When I first heard of this new adaptation, there were two things that came up to me: why do we need an another take on the world's most famous murder case after two successful adaptations, and why in god's name Branagh wants to put himself in the shoes of David Suchet, THE Poirot incarnation in most people's minds. It's a losing battle almost by default, like comparing the bland Kate Middleton to the glamorous superstar that was Lady Diana. But anyway, I decided to give the poor guy a chance to impress me and maybe,do a decent job. This proved to be a false hope from the moment I was confronted with that monstrosity right in the middle of his face, which was so distracting that you couldn't concentrate on the talking whenever his face was in focus, which is quite often. Here, he's trying to solve a murder case in a compartment of the luxurious transcontinental train Orient Express, and each and every one of the title characters seem to have a motif for murder.There are-to be fair-a couple of novelties Branagh brought to the character and the film itself- his version of Poirot (while equally impeccably dressed), has a sense of humour that Suchet was lacking, which occasionally borders on slapstick. The opening plot is completely irrelevant for the main story save for the fact that it was obviously used merely as an excuse to enchant us with Poirot's little petty obsessions and his little gray zellz. Also, in the breakfast scenes we can see Branagh visibly enjoying the role which reassures the viewer that this movie just might be worth the while. The new Poirot is also much more romantic than his predecessor and not afraid to show it (if talking to a photo qualifies as affection). Ultimately, the new sleuth is in a much better shape and doesn't need Hastings to chase a suspect down a dangerously fragile railway bridge. But. Branagh (doing double-duty both as the main character and director) assembled a whole galaxy of superstars to embody the suspects (in the former version, only Jessica Chastain was a known name). What works great on paper proved tricky on film, since there are too many suspects for the director to give each one enough screen time to seduce us with their personalities. Instead, we get just a taste of the immense talent with which the famous train is loaded, and many act merely as prototypes instead as full-fledged characters. While Michelle Pfeiffer uses every opportunity to shine as the flirtatious Mrs Hubbard, someone as charismatic as Judi Dench is reduced to a grumpy princess Dragomiroff who isn't doing a lot of talking but alas, a lot of dog-fondling. This might just be the single biggest issue of this reiteration of Agatha Christie's novel: all those A-list actors are underemployed in the whole scheme of the script. Johnny Depp, of course, plays the shady victim, and Penelope Cruz doesn't really impress as Pilar Estravados, a character borrowed from 'Hercule Poirot's Christmas'. There are some factual misinterpretations: Vinkovci, in Yugoslavia, where the murder takes place, is in the continental part of the country which happens to be as flat as a chess board, and the scenery in the movie rather resembles the Alps. Other than that, the redeeming qualities of the whole undertaking are the gloriously executed production design: the glamorous Art Deco interiors, the stylish costumes and the breathtaking panoramic vistas of the surrounding scenery. Details from the train are the icing on this semi-successful cake: the table settings, the white tablecloths and decorative lights, the lavish armchairs and the delicious desserts delivered by waiters in white suits. If there's one thing you'll take away from all this, no matter if you liked the film or not, it will be the urge to take a train ride to anywhere at the earliest opportunity. And that might be a success in itself.",6,1,3,11 November 2017
