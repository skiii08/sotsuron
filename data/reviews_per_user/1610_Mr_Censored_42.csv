Alien 3," Fincher's Troubled Debut and an Inferior Sequel.
","'You've been in my life so long, I can't remember anything else.' - Ripley Following the events of James Cameron's 'Aliens,' 'Alien³' virtually nulls the events of the previous film, and instead finds Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) crash landing alone on a prison planet, surrounded by murderers and rapists. When she discovers some unwanted cargo, things only go from bad to worse, in true 'Alien' fashion.'Alien³' is as undoubtedly famous for being director David Fincher's (Fight Club) first film, but also for its troubled production that resulted in a compromised and ultimately messy film. After a gaggle of directors and writers had their way with the material, Fincher was ushered in on the project at the last minute. Without a script in hand, the first-time feature-film director did the best he could with what he was given. Unfortunately, all the talent in the world can't save a film from a lack of structure and too many cooks in the kitchen.To be fair, Fincher does about as well as anyone could have expected. The film has an undeniably murky tone that clashes with that of the suspenseful 'Alien' and action packed 'Aliens,' making it an entity all its own. The opening of the film sets the mood beautifully, and despite rubbing fans of the franchise the wrong way, is a bold way to go. Fincher's unique eye, while put to much better use in later films, is what ultimately carries the film and helps it rise above its lack of cohesive story. While you may not understand or care about everything going on, you'll certainly be engaged by the visual show at hand.Unfortunately, though, the film never reaches the greatness of its predecessors, making it an inferior sequel. In the years following its release, Fincher has all but disowned it and it has become a black sheep of sorts in its own franchise -- a franchise which has never truly recovered from this mis-step. Truth be told, there's some juice to this installment, and Fincher fans will be delighted to see his touch put to use in this sci-fi element, but in the end, 'Alien³' is what happens when an over-bearing studio and careless producers tamper with the creative process.",6,0,1,26 January 2010
Requiem for a Dream," Beautifully Ugly.
","Spending 100 minutes with 'Requiem for a Dream' is like falling down a slippery slope that never lets up. You'll partake in the addictions with the characters on-screen and follow the downward spiral that ensues. In just his second directorial effort, Darren Aronofsky has crafted a film that is both beautiful and tragic, as well as emotionally gripping. You'll get to know and love, as well as sympathize with the characters, in spite of their sometimes selfish and ignorant decisions, all in the pursuit of improving their own lives. A widowed TV-junkie, a sheltered young woman with over-bearing parents, the boyfriend who just wants to make his girlfriend happy and a man who dreams of making his mother proud -- these aren't junkies, but rather, victims of their addictions who, as much as they try to overcome it and make things better, only end up worsening their troubles, brilliantly illustrating the devastating effects of any addiction, be it narcotics or otherwise.To say 'Requiem for a Dream' is the most effective P.S.A. to date would be an understatement. Show this to any teenager who is even thinking about trying hard drugs and you'll likely turn them around. There are many who have said it before me, but this should be a mandatory screening for high school health classes. It's both stunning and true to life how quickly the lives of the characters get swallowed up in their addiction, and no matter what walk of life you come from, and even if you've never tried a mind-altering substance in your life, you'll relate to it in some form or another. Give this film to anyone lacking life experiences, and it will be guaranteed to have a positive impact on their future choices.While the film is highly stylized and as drugged-out visually as its characters are, it never loses ground or strays from its humanity. The characters are brought to life by a brilliant ensemble cast. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly as young lovers trying to make it on their own are convincing and likable, but it is Marlon Wayans, known for his comedic roles, who really shines among the young actors. You may know him from 'Scary Movie' or 'Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood,' but his role in this film shows he has the acting chops and the charisma to break out into more serious film roles. It's a shame, then, that he has yet to do so. Then there's Ellen Burstyn, who plays the TV and food junkie beautifully. Burstyn disappears into her role completely, and delivers a performance that can only be described as heart-breaking. Behind all the style, Aronofsky handles his characters with maturity, giving them enough time to build while keeping up a brisk pace. You may only spend 100 minutes with 'Requiem for a Dream,' but its effects will last a lifetime.",10,1,2,15 July 2009
Se7en," 'This isn't going to have a happy ending.'
","'If we catch John Doe and he turns out to be the devil, I mean if he's Satan himself, that might live up to our expectations, but he's not the devil. He's just a man.' – Detective SomersetSeven days. Seven deadly sins. Seven murders. Someone has a message and wants to be heard loud and clear. It's up to seasoned detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and cocky newcomer David Mills (Brad Pitt) to track down the killer, who in the end, proves to be anything but ordinary and routine.Directed by David Fincher ('Fight Club') and drawn from a script by Andrew Kevin Walker ('8mm'), 'Se7en' is perhaps one of the most unsettling, most gruesome and most unforgettable thrillers to come from the 90's. Giving even 'The Silence of the Lambs' a run for its money, Fincher's film is chock full of moody atmosphere and gloomy set-pieces. Rarely do the two detectives stumble into a brightly lit room, and the rain that plagues their non-descript, crime-filled city refuses to let up until the killer is revealed. Coming off of the troubled production that was 'Alien 3,' Fincher was given a second shot, and with this film, defines a style all his own that had been plagiarized to death by the turn of the century. The cinematography and ambient direction are fresh for its time and hold up today – at fourteen years old, the film still looks stunning – and serves up a truly unique experience. The world created in this film may be too much to stomach for some, as it shows humanity at its worst with a serial killer who considers himself a hero, a savior even. Occasionally the film breaks for some slight situational humor that only serves to further humanize our two main leads, but for the most part, it's a wholly disturbing and gut-wrenching experience, right down to the final reveal of the killer and the inescapable ending.In a way, 'Se7en' could be seen as the anti-'Lethal Weapon' -- A buddy-cop comedy without the comedy or the buddies. Instead, our well-worn pro, just six days from retirement, has been beaten down and drained by the world he lives in and is only leaving the job to salvage what humanity is left inside of himself. The arrogant new guy is fueled by past successes and a hunger for action that perhaps his older counterpart once had but tragically lost. The shocking ending only serves to juxtapose the two characters. Morgan Freeman is solid as always, while Brad Pitt overacts the part just a hair. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pitt's wife sweet and as human as possible, while Kevin Spacey has a role in this film that can only be described as iconic. With a great cast under the brilliant direction of a budding, young and talented director, 'Se7en' is as close to perfection as the horror/thriller genre gets.",10,0,0,23 June 2009
Fight Club," The Greatest Cult Film of All-Time?
","'That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love? Well, it works both ways.' – NarratorWhile it flopped upon its initial release and received Luke-warm reviews at best, 'Fight Club' has worked its way over the years to becoming perhaps the biggest and best cult film of all time. Directed by David Fincher ('The Curious Case of Benjamin Button') the film is as famous for its unique visual style as it is for its nihilistic and dark comedic tone. Its tale of anarchy was, in a way, a refreshing slap to the face of the mainstream, which is what makes it such a beautiful and unique film, and it still holds up just as well today, over ten years later.Starring Edward Norton as the Narrator, 'Fight Club' tells the story of a man living in a sterilized environment, suffering from insomnia and yearning to unleash his pent-up angst. He doesn't know why he can't sleep and perhaps he is going crazy, but things only get more interesting when he stumbles upon an interesting character in Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) who essentially resembles everything he himself is not. United, they take to the underground and form a fight club where grown men can come and pummel the snot out of one another in good fun. Things take a turn for the worse, though, when Tyler's plans get out of hand and a troubled woman (Helena Bonham-Carter) comes between the two conflicted personalities.The film is drawn from a bold novel by Chuck Palahniuk and is about as anti-Hollywood as a major studio film can be. Edward Norton breaks through in perhaps his finest role to date, capturing all the humor and melodramatic baggage that comes with the character exquisitely, while Brad Pitt gets a chance to go over the top in a way that few actors can handle. The film is over two-hours long, but is paced just right so that you lose track of time and feel immersed in the narrative each and every time. No doubt, it's one of Fincher's finest films and one of the best examples of film in the 1990's. Even after the twist has revealed itself, 'Fight Club' is a movie worth coming back to time and time again.",10,2,6,26 January 2010
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is anything but forgettable.
","In 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall,' musician Peter Bretter -- played by Jason Segel of 'How I Met Your Mother' and 'Freaks & Geeks' fame -- finds himself at the receiving end of a dumping by way of his TV-star girlfriend, the titular character of Sarah Marshall (Kirsten Bell). It goes without saying that he takes it rough, attempting to heal his wounds by boozing it up day and night, slumming in a string of one-night stands and barely catching a glimpse of daylight. It's not bad enough that every time he turns on the TV or goes to work he has to see her face (he provides the score for her TV show), but when he decides to take off to Hawaii in hopes of fading her from his memory, she happens to be staying at the exact same resort as him, with her new lover, the charismatic rock-star, Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) in tow. With a little help from a desk-clerk played by Mila Kunis, he starts to come to terms with his predicament, while simultaneously finding new love and a renewed sense of passion for a long in-the-works rock opera about Dracula -- with puppets.What makes 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' great, and what sets it aside from typical break-up comedy fare is that it's also a movie about finding the drive and ambition within yourself to do what truly makes you happy. It's in the same vein as other Judd Apatow fare such as 'Knocked Up' and 'The 40 Year-Old Virgin' in that while it's got a filthy mind, it's also got substantial heart. This flick, while being an Apatow production, was actually written by its star, Jason Segel, giving it a very personal feeling. Nothing is overly sugar-coated, as Segel finds himself in awkward moments that are a little too realistic to be works of fiction. The supporting cast -- consisting of Apatow regulars and otherwise -- are as wild as they seem natural at times. Mila Kunis is stunning and sweet as Peter's newfound love-interest, while Kirsten Bell plays the manipulative, confused ex-girlfriend to a T. Russell Brand isn't so much playing the role of the self-absorbed, sex-nuts rocker, as he is playing a character that seems to exist within himself. Other, slightly minor roles from Bill Hader, Paul Rudd, Jonah Hill and Jack McBrayer provide some of the more off-color humor of the film. Its a well-rounded film that will speak volumes to many people, regardless of where they are at in their lives. Segel's script keeps things feeling real, playing it close to the chest and not afraid to delve into the most awkward and true-to-life situations. Its ending is a bit clichéd, but would you want it any other way? Overall, you'll leave this one feeling satisfied and with a little left to chew on.",8,2,6,23 March 2009
"I Love You, Man"," A Bro-mantic Comedy That Actually Works!
","While most romantic comedies offer a simple formula, 'I Love You, Man,' offers a slight variation of the tried and true. In this film, our main character has already found the one and is instead in search of a some bro-love. While the concept may sound awkward at first, rest assured that the film keeps the laughs coming often enough that things never get weird.Paul Rudd, whose resurrected career has been on a roll as of late, plays Pete, a successful real estate agent on the verge of marrying his dream girl, played by Rashida Jones ('Cop Out'). There's just one kink, though, as Pete is socially awkward and without male companionship, which means he's going to have a difficult time locking down a best man for his wedding. Enter Sydney, played by Jason Segal ('How I Met Your Mother'), who stumbles into Pete's life after crashing one of his open house events. The two hit it off, jam to a bit of Rush here and there, and before long, the two have a relationship that rivals that of Pete's impending nuptials.'I Love You, Man' is a simply fun twist on an old genre. Rudd and Segal have great chemistry together (as hinted at in 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall') and you buy that they are best-buds. Not only is the film heavy on Rush tunes (always a plus, in my book) but the band themselves perform within the movie. Also in house are roles from the likes of Jane Curtain, J.K. Simmons, Andy Samberg, Jon Favreau, Jaime Pressly and the Incredible Hulk himself, Lou Ferrigno. On the downside, the film doesn't really offer anything new outside of its 'bro-mance' angle, and in turn, is as by the numbers and predictable as it gets. In spite of this, though, it's a fun, feel-good film that is never short on laughs. Worth a watch for anyone who appreciates the Judd Apatow generation of comedies.",7,2,3,1 March 2010
Batman Returns," 'I believe the word you're looking for is 'Aaahh'!'
","Before 'The Dark Knight' changed everyone's perception of what a Batman movie (or sequel, for that matter) should be, there was Tim Burton's 'Batman Returns,' reaching sixteen years back to 1992. With perhaps the best cast of any of the original four Batman films (we're talking the Burton/Schumacher fare) and improved confidence by it's director, 'Returns' is a rare occasion of a sequel one-upping it's predecessor. Sure, audiences failed to embrace it at the time in the way that they ate up 1989's 'Batman,' but time has revealed this one to be the better film.As Burton states in the commentary track for the film, 'Batman Returns' is less a sequel than it is another chapter in the Batman saga. And visually, the film reflects that. To match it's decidedly darker tone, Burton gives a much grimmer, much more realistic look for Gotham City than the comic-book look he gave the first. He immerses his characters in gritty darkness, whether it's The Penguin lurking in the murky sewers, or Bruce Wayne sitting alone in a darkened Wayne Manor waiting for the Bat-signal. Everything about the movie is much more adult, more mature and meaner than before, which played a big part of it's initial backlash. Afterall, it's hard to sell Happy Meals and action figures when a certain character in the film bites noses, feasts on raw fish and barfs black sludge. Therefore, it must be said that it takes a more adult audience to appreciate this film, and it's not something for children to be watching -- although I surely got my fill of this movie at the tender age of eight years old.The story, about about a deformed baby outcast from society by his own parents, who takes refuge in the sewers only to re-emerge as iconic villain/urban-legend, The Penguin is almost as depressing as the story of the meek bachelorette Selina Kyle who, after being pushed over-the-edge by her boss, is re-incarnated as the sexed-up, merciless Catwoman. Truth be told, 'Batman Returns' feels more like a movie about the two villains than it does it's title character, as Batman (with Michael Keaton reprising his role) takes a back-seat role. Danny DeVito is natural as The Penguin, and not just in body-shape. This is a rare case of an actor disappearing into his role, and DeVito has hardly had a more interesting part since. Michelle Pfeiffer, on the other side of the coin, seems to be having fun with her character, and watching her in Catwoman makes one think that maybe she was more deserving of her own spin-off film, instead of the 2004 abomination that is 'Catwoman.' Christopher Walken has a role as b-villain Max Shreck, and really, what can be said about the guy? He's great in everything he does, and his portrayal of the heartless megalomaniac that drives the motivation of each respective villain is spot on.Overall, 'Batman Returns' is a much more complicated film than the first. Those looking for a typical comic-book or superhero movie may find themselves disappointed in what they find here. However, like another, more popular Batman sequel in recent memory, it's a film that proves that Batman can be taken to extreme lengths and out of the context of his original format. It may feel more like a Tim Burton film than your average Batman flick, but it's also one of the best pieces of celluloid to feature the character. It's a movie that has gradually found it's audience over time, and surely, it's better than the two films that follow. This is, in my opinion, the only film prior to 2005 that gets the spirit of The Caped Crusader right.",8,3,7,31 December 2008
Terminator Salvation," A flawed yet worthy entry in the 'Terminator' franchise
","When the news first broke that a fourth 'Terminator' movie was in the works and that none other than 'Charlie's Angels' director McG would be at the helm, the fan-boy world let out a collective groan. It helped matters that Christian Bale signed on to play the savior of the human race, John Connor, but for the most part, 'Terminator Salvation' had an up-hill battle to fight. Here we are with the fourth installment in a franchise that many doubt should have gone past James Cameron's masterpiece, 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day,' in the first place. This is the third director to tackle the material, with a script penned by the same guys who delivered the poorly received 'Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines' (not to mention 'Catwoman.' Yikes!). To make matters even more complicated, the script has been re-heated and doctored by Jonathan Nolan ('The Dark Knight') to make the role of John Connor bigger than in the original script. All of this, while being made within the constraints of a PG-13 rating (a first for the series) and a toy-company to pacify. With so many cooks in the kitchen, so many expectations to meet and so many watching and judging, it's quite amazing, then, that is turned out as well as it did.'Terminator Salvation' begins with Marcus (Sam Worthington), a man on death row for killing his brother, among others. Coerced by a cancer-ridden lover, Serena (Helena Bonham-Carter), he signs off on letting his soon-to-be-dead body be used for scientific experiments and advancements. We watch him receive only the best capital punishment that Texas can afford, only to find himself resurrected in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, circa 2018. The Judgment Day that Sarah Connor warned about has devastated mankind, as they fight for survival against Skynet and the machines who see them as the enemy and seek to eliminate them. The self-fulfilling prophet, John Connor (Bale) has yet to take his rightful place, though. There are those who believe in him, and those in power (Michael Ironside) who don't. When his future (or his past) is put into question – his future father, a teenage Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), is captured and on his way to termination – he must work together with a man – or a machine – whom he was raised not to trust.If the story sounds incomplete, or that it's missing something, then you aren't alone. The biggest problem facing this film is its script. Maybe it worked better in its original form, but by making more room for the character of John Connor, it starts to bloat and loses its impact. It doesn't help that the film is short, clocking in at well under two hours, and doesn't allow enough time to flesh out its plot-points. For example, you'll notice Connor's wife (Bryce Dallas-Howard, replacing Claire Danes) is visibly pregnant, and yet, nothing is ever mentioned about it in the film. The character of Marcus Wright is an intriguing and original addition to the 'Terminator' mythos, played perfectly and convincingly by Worthington. While this part of the story is fleshed out well-enough, it's often put on the sidelines to make screen-time for Bale/John Connor. While you couldn't ask for a better adult John Connor than Christian Bale, there's simply not enough for him to do in this film, other than to give inspiring speeches to his comrades or go hand-to-hand combat with the machines. He makes an imposing and impressive Connor, giving the expected intensity and presence, but the character is barely expanded upon what was already given to us in the first two films. In short, if you're a newcomer watching this flick, you're not likely to be convinced that this man is all that important to the future of mankind and maybe – just maybe – he's got an overblown ego, and a temper to boot.On the upside of things, director McG deserves a round of applause. Not only did he take fan-boy criticisms in stride throughout the creation of the film, but on his end – the direction – he succeeds on virtually all fronts. While the story is weak and flawed, the visual aspect of the film is stunning. Full-on, from the moment we are re-introduced to the John Connor character, you believe that what you are seeing is a post-Judgment day world. One key moment early in the film finds Connor's allies annihilated by a bomb, covering the area in a sea of smoke and a rain-storm of ash. It's a far-cry from the brief war scenes we were given in the previous 'Terminator' films, and in this particular scene, inspiration seems to have been drawn from Steven Spielberg's World War II epic, 'Saving Private Ryan.' Obviously, this is a fictional war, and not as dense as the real-life tragedy Spielberg portrayed in his film, but visually, McG nails it. Another spot where the film shines are in its special effects. True to the late-Stan Winston's method, most of the effects are achieved practically, rather than relying too heavily on CGI. The Terminators in the film look not only mean and heartless, but real. Heck, we even get Arnold Schwarzenegger's face rendered to Roland Kickinger's body, to re-create the famous T-800, and it's hard to tell the difference between real and fake. All of this, of course, on top of one outrageous action sequence after another and nods to previous films galore. You'll see motorcycles chasing tractor-trailer trucks in an interesting role reversal, and you'll watch as John Connor sets traps to the tune of Guns N' Roses 'You Could Be Mine.' All of these elements help seal the deal, making it feel like an authentic 'Terminator' sequel and less of a cash-in (which, for the most part, it is). In the end, despite being light on plot and character development, 'Terminator: Salvation' packs enough of a punch to be considered a worthy entry in the franchise and a brilliant summer blockbuster to boot.",7,2,4,26 May 2009
Zodiac," One of 2007's Finest; One of the Best of its Kind.
","For a number of years the Zodiac Killer terrorized citizens of the San Francisco area as well as the journalists and police force who worked feverishly to stop him to no avail. 'Zodiac' is as much about the murders as it is about the aftermath of the events and the toll it took on a handful of people who perhaps sacrificed more than their job called for in an effort to reveal the killer's identity.David Fincher brings the true life horror story to life with what is perhaps his most methodical and restrained effort to date. With as much attention to detail as possible (down to matching the wardrobes of the cast to that of the real-life victims) Fincher reels back his usual sense of style in favor for a more matter-of-fact, realistic tone, letting the story and the actors speak for themselves. There are moments such as the taxi-cab scene where his style is in full-effect, but unlike his previous film, 'Panic Room,' the film doesn't hinge solely on good looks. At times, such as the murder by the lake, it's easy to forget that you're watching a movie.The film is host to a wealth of knock-out performances, the least of all being Robert Downey Jr. in a comeback role that surely should have earned him at least an Oscar nod. Surely, his turn in this movie was more effective than that in 'Tropic Thunder,' but I digress. Downey is almost too natural and too perfect as the flamboyant and sensational journalist Paul Avery. Jake Gyllenhaal is given perhaps one of his juiciest roles to date as the cartoonist turned novelist Robert Graysmith who puts everything -- including his wife and kids -- on hold for the sake of his obsession. Also of note are Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards as a pair of detectives hot on the Zodiac's trail.All in all, 'Zodiac' is an in-depth account of real-life events and is certainly a lot to take in. The passage of time thankfully goes by fast, as you'll more than likely find yourself wrapped up in the story much like the people you're watching become. For Fincher, it marks a new standard and shows the director as more than just an MTV-bred cult film-maker. This is without a doubt one of the finest films from 2007 and one of the best of its kind. Not to be missed.",9,2,3,8 April 2010
Cloverfield," A modern monster movie for a modern audience.
","During a going away party, a group of young New Yorkers find themselves shook up by earthquakes, tumbling buildings, fire and ash and one big bad mean monster. Travelling across town during an evacuation proves to be a difficult task, as they attempt to save a friend while the military is busy pushing everyone off the island in an attempt to cut their losses and destroy a monster that is bound and determined to level the city. Thankfully the group has a video camera in hand, and what 'Cloverfield' presents itself to be is exactly what the disaster looks like through the eyes of innocent bystanders. Nothing more, nothing less.Think 'Godzilla' through the eyes of 'The Blair Witch Project.' What the makers of 'Cloverfield' were going for was an American version of the infamous Japanese monster and to that end, they succeeded. Through the eye of a single camera, all the necessary tension and chaos is captured in a realistic manner. Forget the fact that the CGI on the monster is, well, unconvincing. In line with another like-minded movie – 'The Mist' – the dodgy effects are redeemed by solid storytelling, tight pacing and shocking visuals. Lord knows, Hollywood loved destroying major cities on film in the past, and in a post 9/11 world, seeing buildings crumble and fire-balls raining down on the streets of New York City is all the more shocking. There's nothing overly glossy about 'Cloverfield,' which is a testament to its genius. If you can believe that a creature can actually exist that is capable of causing as much damage as a tsunami, then you'll believe 'Cloverfield' to be a certified Monster-Movie classic.",8,0,0,28 April 2009
Alien," At 30 years of age, 'Alien' remains invigorating and vital to this day.
","The crew aboard Nostromo – a commercial towing vehicle (a.k.a. spacecraft) – find their return to Earth interrupted by a mysterious signal. Upon their investigation, they stumble across an abandoned alien spacecraft, and unwittingly bring aboard a deadly threat. It seems the same creature(s) that wiped out the alien spacecraft intend to do the same to the Nostromo crew, and it has some interesting ways of breeding as well.Ridley Scott's second feature-length film, and the one that put him on the map, 'Alien,' arrived in 1979, truly ahead of its time. In the wake of the smashing success of 'Star Wars,' the science fiction genre was suddenly in vogue, and in an attempt to cash in on its own success, Twentieth Century Fox greenlit the film which is in stark contrast to its family friendly predecessor. Dark, brooding and menacing – these are words that only begin to describe 'Alien.' Akin to 'Jaws' and 'Halloween,' it was destined to become a seminal and influential film, inspiring countless other film-makers, spawning a string of sequels and ultimately leaving its mark on the film-world, setting the bar so high that to this day, no one has crafted a better sci-fi/horror story.To say everything in 'Alien' is perfect would be a bit of an overstatement. Yes, there are some special effects that look ridiculous by today's standards (chest-burster scene, anyone?) but are forgiven by the film's sense of realism, tight-pacing and bleak atmosphere. It helps, for starters, that most of the interactions between characters were improvised by the actors, further lending credibility to the film's grip on reality. Despite the fact that the plot unravels aboard a massive spacecraft, you buy it because the characters look and feel real (with several of the players being middle-aged) and because they fit into the environment so naturally. Sigourney Weaver, as Ripley, sticks out the most as our unorthodox (at the time) female lead, single-handedly giving birth to the strong but feminine hero and the Sarah Connors of the world. To further the impact, the steady hand of Ridley Scott allows the film to play out at a natural, albeit, dreadful pace. As the film counts the minutes, things only worsen for the Nostromos crew, stacking suspenseful stalking scenes with paranoia and a sense of impending doom, until its intense and rewarding conclusion.'Alien' is a slow-burner in every sense of the word, but thankfully, it never drags. Everything in the film sets up a payoff and the closer you pay attention and invest yourself in its happenings, the more rewarding it will be. You'll be wowed by the cinematography, the Jerry Goldsmith score that bubbles beneath the surface, the strong cast and the iconic and disturbing imagery of the Alien itself, as dreamed up by H.R. Giger. Over time, it's earned its high pedestal in the pop culture world and is worth revisiting time and time again. A true classic in every sense of the word.",10,1,3,3 June 2009
Rocky II," The Return of the Italian Stallion
","The original 'Rocky' was such a success that a sequel seemed a no-brainer. In 1979, Sylvester Stallone returned to the big-screen as Rocky Balboa, while simultaneously serving as writer and director, in 'Rocky II.' The film re-united Stallone with the core cast of Burt Young, Burgess Meredith, Carl Weathers and Talia Shire, was a smash success and -- at the time -- the most successful sequel to date. It's easy to see why.Picking up where the first film left off, 'Rocky II' follows the fight between Apollo Creed and Rocky Balboa all the way to the hospital, with Creed hungry for a re-match and Balboa announcing his retirement. Things don't go exactly as planned for our hero, however, and as he tries to settle down and live a healthy lifestyle, he only comes to realize that he should embrace his fate, doing the one thing he knows best, ultimately getting back in the ring with his nemesis for Round 2.While most films end with a happy ending and never deal with the ugly aftermath, 'Rocky II' is different in that it finds its titular character broken, beat and bruised, both physically and mentally. Although he gets to marry the love of his life, Adrian, he finds that his initial success is short-lived and struggles to stay afloat. Instead of repeating the formula of the first, this film merely serves as an extension of its predecessor, and in pretty much every respect, succeeds. Stallone is spot-on yet again, and pulling triple duty doesn't seem to phase him in the slightest. 'Rocky II' is the perfect companion piece to 'Rocky' and much like the first will leave engrossed and on the edge of your seat.",9,0,0,11 March 2010
Predator," Welcome To The Jungle.
","'If it bleeds, we can kill it.' - Dutch Before turning from celebrities to politicians, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jesse Venutra starred in John McTiernan's 'Predator.' In the high-energy action-film, a special forces team, lead by Schwarzenegger, are thrust into Central America on a rescue mission. What starts out to be just another high-risk job for the crew quickly takes a turn for the worse, as the group find themselves being hunted by an alien who can blend into the environment and whom, despite all their fire-power, can't be stopped.As McTiernan's first effort (he would later go on to direct 'Die Hard'), 'Predator' still holds up as an effective action-flick/monster-mash to this day. With plenty of quotable quotes from Arnie ('Get to the chopper!') and a supporting group of macho-stereotypes, it's a full-on, action packed ride that doesn't let up for one minute -- logic be damned! The Predator itself -- although looking somewhat hokey by today's standards -- is an interesting and challenging villain, with a face that only a mother (or Stan Winston) could love. Before he descended upon L.A. and did battle with other 'Aliens' in a couple of mediocre cross-over films, he was giving The Terminator himself a run for his money. Schwarzenegger is pretty much playing the action hero as only he knows best, and the final act that finds him engaging in war games with the deadly creature is among his most entertaining work. Overall, 'Predator' hits all the right marks, with it's sense of humor, sense of camaraderie, and overall assault on the senses. If you like non-stop gun-fire, lasers that blast holes through heads and alpha-male posturing, this may be the flick for you.",8,1,2,25 March 2009
Watchmen," A modern classic.
","In an alternate timeline, Nixon is still president and the world is sinking under the pressure of a cold war against Russia. A faded gang of superheroes lay dormant until one of their own is murdered, prompting an investigation that leads to a startling discovery about the future of the world and what the cost of peace and the salvation of mankind may be.As director Zack Snyder's first film with actual characters in it, 'Watchmen' takes its time in building a back-story for its broad range of colorful characters and misfits, and is all the better for it. The narrative bounces back and forth between the past and the present (which, as it turns out, is a fictional 1985) and yet, through the 162 minutes the film takes to reach its point, it never lets up for one minute or becomes a chore to watch. Truly, this is one film where you won't want to miss a minute, with each scene carrying as much weight and relevancy as the next. While the material at hand is very dark and mature, and even though it won't appeal to a younger or more mainstream audience, it is certainly a film that functions on multiple levels.The film is chockfull of excellent performances from its cast, but it is Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach who stands out from the pack. This brilliant casting choice creates an iconic character that, many years down the line, the film will be remembered primarily for. As for direction, Snyder flexes his cinematic muscle with enough caffeinated action and jarring visual effects to match wits with the dense plot at hand, in turn, making this his finest film to date. Sure, there is a plethora of directors who could have tried their hand at this material, some perhaps more qualified, but Snyder's film is both classy and stylish and, in a nutshell, as close to perfection as it gets. It's an assault on the senses as well as the psyche, and perhaps one of the darkest superhero tales of our time, translated flawlessly to film.'Watchmen' might not be enough to pacify one of its creators, but the purists and movie-lovers alike will find it a rare treat in film-making where a film based on a graphic novel or comic book can capture its source material so beautifully while simultaneously stimulating and satisfying those who are not already initiated. 'Watchmen' is one of those films that, as we look back on this decade in the future, will be talked about and remembered fondly as a definitive film for its era. This is not just one of the finest films of the year, but also one of the best of its kind.",10,3,7,21 July 2009
The Matrix Revolutions," 'Revolutions' provides substantial conclusion.
","'Wait. I've seen this. I stand here, right here, and I'm supposed to say something. I say, 'Everything that has a beginning has an end, Neo.' - Agent SmithPicking up where 'The Matrix Reloaded' left off, 'The Matrix Revolutions' has a big task ahead of itself. While attempting to wrap up looses ends from the previous installments, it also has to provide closure on the overall saga as well as live up to the precedents set before it.Was 'Revolutions' a disappointment? Well, financially it performed much weaker than its big brother in 'Reloaded' but otherwise, the answer remains a resounding 'no.' In fact, 'Revolutions' slightly succeeds at besting the second film, as well as wrapping up the trilogy in a nice and neat manner.Unlike 'Reloaded,' the third installment carries more emotional weight rather than show off its visual marvels. There are two big action scenes that make up about a third of the film. One is a breath-taking invasion of Zion by the sentinels which is so good that you almost forget that we haven't seen our two main characters for the better part of a half-hour. The other, the final showdown between Neo and Agent Smith, is nothing short of epic. Thousands of Smith's clones watch in the streets and the buildings as the two duke it out mano a mano in the rainy streets of The Matrix. These two scenes best what was done in 'Reloaded' and push the plot forward all the better, all the way to its inevitable conclusion.Sure, the film's loaded with clichés and yes, it still has an overall feel and tone similar to 'Reloaded' that doesn't sit well with the original film (Powerade, anyone?), but it's as close to a perfect closing chapter in the trilogy as we were ever going to get. It's got a grand feeling. It's both sentimental and definitive. There are very few franchises in Hollywood that end in a way that ensures there will be no more sequels to water down the formula, and 'The Matrix Revolutions' ends in such a way that not only do you feel satisfied, but that simply, there is nothing left to be done. The Wachowski Brothers close out their trilogy with a bang, slightly redeeming itself while providing appropriate closure.",7,2,3,12 March 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Apparently There is Fate.
","When a sequel comes along 12 years after the fact, it is almost always met with cynicism and scrutiny. Never has the case been truer than with 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.' The fact of the matter is that the two films before it redefined the science fiction genre in their own time, and the question loomed about whether or not a third film was warranted or even logical. Afterall, we saw the Connor clan in 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' take down Skynet in its infancy stages, thus preventing Judgment Day, right? To quote the T-800's infamous gun-shop dialogue from the original 'Terminator' film: 'Wrong.'With original creator James Cameron completely out of the picture, director Jonathan Mostow takes the reins with Arnold Schwarzenegger returning to his titular role once more before settling in as the Governator of California. John Connor, the future leader of the resistance, is played by Nick Stahl this time around as we follow the character at age 22, with the world on the brink of the nuclear fall-out at the hands of Skynet. As before, a T-800 is sent back to ensure his survival, as well as that of his future wife (played by Claire Danes) while another, far more advanced female Terminator is sent back to ensure Connor is taken out of the picture and Judgment Day goes on as planned.One thing the film is missing for certain is James Cameron's touch. To be fair, Mostow is a thoroughly competent action director, but there's a sense of 'been there, done that' with most of the story that makes the proceedings rather stale. You could chalk that up to poor writing, but also because its predecessor leaves the story with nowhere to go. Until it reaches the end, 'Terminator 3' just sort of meanders along, waiting to reach that moment where all is redeemed and John Connor finally is forced to accept his destiny. Having said that, though, there are some excellent action scenes to fill the time with therefore the film never gets boring or loses its pacing.The film has been somewhat maligned for its humor, but it's important to note that it's not anymore of a comedy than 'Terminator 2' was. Quite contrary, the bulk of the film is rather dark and brooding, and goes a long way in ensuring the correct mood and tone is established. There's also some key imagery in the film that makes it somewhat iconic. One scene early on during John's opening dialogue cuts to an ocean floor lined with human skulls and will send chills down your spine, as will the somber ending, which in the end, makes the film. Overall, 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' is definitely a worthy entry in the series, and in spite of its redundancy, manages to entertain as well as push forward the mythology of the franchise.",7,1,1,17 December 2009
Dark City," A Brainy Visual Affair.
","Perhaps one of the very first films in the age of DVD to find its audience following a poor theatrical run, 'Dark City' is the follow-up to director Alex Proyas' other stylistic achievement, the graphic-novel adaptation, 'The Crow.' In the film, our main character, John Murdoch, wakes up in a dingy hotel bath tub, bleeding from his forehead. Scared and confused, he comes to find that he is the suspect in a string of brutal murders and hot on his tale is a mysterious organization known as the Strangers, who oddly resemble the cenobites in Clive Barker's 'Hellraiser,' but whom have the ability to warp the world around them.Like 'The Crow' before it, 'Dark City' is heavy on set-design, bleak atmosphere and memorable visuals, but thankfully, the script (co-written by David S. Goyer) is smart enough not to hinge on special effects and set design, and rather, toys with your expectations while delivering something stream-lined and efficient, instead of being overly long and bloated like it very well could have been. Driving the film is Rufus Sewell as Murdoch, a character who is never sure if what he is seeing or doing is even real. While Sewell sells it, his co-star, Jennifer Connelly, unfortunately isn't given much to do other than look good and sad. Thankfully performances by William Hurt and Keifer Sutherland inject some energy into the narrative, only to bounce off of the underplayed humanity on display by Sewell.While 'The Matrix,' released a year later, would overshadow its influence on the science fiction world and pop-culture in general, it's worth noting that the film still stands as one of the best genre films of the 90's and begs to be seen by anyone with a love for sci-fi in need of some refreshment. It's perhaps the best film by Proyas, and at a breezy 96 minutes, it gets the job done well, never wasting a moment or sacrificing exposition. Even if you're not sold on its plot, you'll at least be mesmerized by its visuals, which in and of itself, is worth the price of admission.",8,0,1,2 March 2010
Good Will Hunting," Worth watching, even if you have to put it on layaway!
","One might think of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck as one-hit-wonders after watching their one and only writing credit come to life in the magnificent 'Good Will Hunting.' In the wake of its success, both went on to become quite prominent in Hollywood, but only for their acting abilities, leading some to question if they really wrote it themselves or not. But surely, if someone (whether it be William Goldman or Kevin Smith) served as a ghostwriter, they wouldn't have been able to keep their mouths shut all this time. We are speaking of an Oscar winning movie here, afterall. No, the two men (especially Damon) deserve all the credit in the world and it's a shame that they haven't written another movie since, because 'Good Will Hunting' has enough soul to eclipse any big-budget block-buster they may have done after the fact.Meet Will Hunting. Will has had a tough childhood. Because of this, he chooses to stick close to his three buddies, drinking and laughing it up, cleaning up the halls of a prestigious college, ignoring his true calling. His gift, it turns out, is that he's more than just a brilliant mathematician – he's a bonafide genius! When a professor catches him at the blackboard solving a problem no one else can, he insists on helping him. In an attempt to break through his tough shell and promote his talent, a therapist (Robin Williams) is brought in and the two find out they are more similar than they care to admit, as Will comes face to face with his brutal past in an attempt to better his future. Ben Affleck stars as his best friend Chuckie. Chuckie has perhaps one of the finest moments towards the end of the film, in a speech where he tells Will that leaving town without saying goodbye would be the best repayment he could ever give his friends. This is without a doubt one of the most moving moments of the film, and surely, one of Affleck's finest roles. As close friends, Damon and Affleck have chemistry that glows in the film; in fact, they seem like brothers from birth. Robin Williams plays the catalyst and almost-father-figure in Will's life, and turns in another fine performance in a serious role. Some improvised bits help keep things feeling natural and he brings the charm in full force, so much so that it's become a cliché for him. 'Good Will Hunting' is that rare kind of inspirational film that may actually inspire some. While Will's story may not be the story of Matt Damon's life, it certainly feels real and hits close to home with anyone who doesn't believe in themselves enough. Directed by Gus Van Sant, it's got little style, instead, focusing tightly on its characters, showing them in their most vulnerable moments. The script, afterall, is the star of the film. What you take away from this film will be its message and its humanity; the fact that it stars Robin Williams in a script written by two Hollywood heroes will only be an afterthought. I tried to find a flaw in it all, and alas, there is none. If anything, the story is a little too predictable -- right up to the telegraphed ending -- but that would be side-stepping the whole purpose of the story. If it takes a little cliché and predictability to drive home such a powerful story, than so be it. The true meaning of 'Good Will Hunting' is invincible in that respect.",10,0,1,16 April 2009
The Mist," The Frank Darabont Redemption?
","Not quite.Following a rather violent storm, an assortment of small-town Maine residents find themselves trapped in a grocery store as a mysterious mist envelopes not only their town, but possibly the rest of the world. It's established early on that if you go into the mist, you don't come back. Well, that's not entirely true, as your legs might make a return. It doesn't even take 48 hours before the local zealot converts two-thirds of the store's population into a blood-thirsty cult, which isn't really much of a feat when the competition -- the outside world -- is populated by gigantic bugs, tentacles, birds and other assorted creatures that the back of the DVD case labels as 'otherworldly.'Writer/Director Frank Darabont ('The Shawshank Redemption,' 'The Green Mile') makes his return to horror in 'The Mist,' adapted from a story written by none-other than Stephen King. Following the undeserving flop of 2001's 'The Majestic,' it's not surprising that 'The Mist' has some key issues. Darabont seems almost unsure of himself making this movie, as the mood is never properly settled. The first half of the flick feels like a glorious and gruesome modern day B-movie. With its nasty special effects (not to mention, some hokey looking tentacles) and ugly creatures, it's a movie that is certain to haunt the dreams of any children that may catch a glimpse by mistake. The second half, though, attempts to make some sort of commentary on human nature, and gets lost in the monster madness. Truth be told, 'The Mist' is much more effective when it plays it straight, almost like a 'Night Of The Living Dead' with bugs.Thomas Jane plays the protagonist to Marcia Gay Harden's truly scary antagonist, as the townsfolk ultimately succumb to some blood-thirsty creepy-crawlies and some old-school, hardcore bible-thumping. While the second half of the flick is chilling in its own right, it never reaches its point. You think what you're watching it going to make a statement and then 'Bang!' -- at the speed of a bullet -- its dropped. The ending is truly cruel and will leave you unsettled for some time after watching it, which, I suppose, means that 'The Mist' did its job correctly. It's certainly not Darabont's best work, but hopefully he'll get his sea-legs again and come back with another true classic. Taken for what it is, though, it's a movie that is guaranteed to make you squirm in your seat a bit and make your blood run cold at other moments, as you shout at the screen to some of it's blatantly ignorant characters. Clichés may run rampant, but much enjoyment can be derived from the new aged creature-feature.",7,1,3,3 April 2009
The Game," A Decent Thriller from Fincher. Are You Game?
","In 'The Game,' Michael Douglas plays Nicholas, a cold and unlikeable investment banker who is in desperate need of a life-lesson. Enter his brother, Conrad, played by Sean Penn. As a birthday present, Conrad sets Nicholas up with a mysterious company that intends to play a high-concept, high-risk game with his life. The end results promise a life-changing experience, but when things get too real too quick and as it gets harder and harder to tell where the game ends and where it begins, Nicholas begins to lose his grip on reality and on himself.The film, directed by David Fincher ('Se7en') is a stylish and moody piece, with the director's strong visual sense in full-form. Although the film never quite nails a specific tone (thanks, in part, to its flawed script) it is anchored greatly by Michael Douglas, who keeps us attached to a character who is rather unpleasant on the whole. Along the way, he makes acquaintances with a beautiful waitress (Deborah Kara Unger) and survives gun-fights, car crashes, a trip to Mexico and a fall from a very tall building. Is his life falling apart, or is this just all part of the elaborate game he entered? You can't help but shout at the screen because it is so blatantly obvious where the film is manipulating us. Thus, the film's biggest flaw: It doesn't leave much to the imagination.Those seeking a well-made thriller will at least find some goodies with 'The Game.' Even if you reach its conclusion before its running time is over, you'll at least remain engaged in watching Nicholas' redemption while Fincher's style makes for an impressive looking film regardless of plot-points. Could it have been better? Sure. Is it an okay way to pass two hours? Definitely.",6,0,1,10 February 2010
8 Mile," The Real Slim Shady
","Directed by Curtis Hanson, '8 Mile' is essentially a vehicle for hip-hop heavyweight Eminem to tell the tale of how he went from a trailer-park dwelling blue-collar worker to a pop music superstar seemingly overnight. Rather than capture all of the glories of fame, '8 Mile' instead focuses on the rapper's rugged beginnings and, although only loosely based on his life-story, humanizes the rapper, who at the time of the film's release, was the most controversial force in music.The film opens with our hero, B-Rabbit (as portrayed by Eminem), practicing his routine in front of a bathroom mirror before engaging in a rap competition. Unfortunately, he fails before he even begins, and the rest of the film follows him as he struggles with poverty, his overbearing mother (Kim Basinger), his lesser-motivated crew of friends, his ex-girlfriend, his current girlfriend (Brittany Murphy) who will apparently do anything for her big break and a posse of hardcore rappers who may or may not see him as a threat, but see fit to beat him down at any opportunity anyway.The amazing thing about '8 Mile' is how realistic and down to Earth it really is. A vanity project this is not, as Eminem clearly had a story worth telling and the film doesn't skimp on the dirt. The cinematography goes a long way in capturing the gritty feel of a decaying city and the people that inhabit it. From the decrepit trailer parking and crumbling buildings to the broken down vehicles that cart the characters around to their various jobs and musical endeavors, everything in the film has a genuine feel. You truly feel like you are on the cold streets of Detroit, alone and depressed. Even Eminem, arguably the most successful pop-culture figure at the time, looks miserable and underfed, which is only amplified by his random fits of rage which come all too naturally but feel justified within the context of the film.They say it's tougher to play yourself than a character, and if that is so, then Eminem would have been wise to further pursue a film career (you know, aside from his hilarious cameo in 'Funny People'). His performance in this film is grounded and realistic, and we often find the rapper acting circles around more seasoned pros like Brittany Murphy (whose role suffers for being poorly written) and Mekhi Phifer (who plays essentially every character he's ever played before, albeit, with dreadlocks) and is sure to convince anyone regardless of whether you're a fan of his music/public persona or not. A few minor flaws do little to drag it down, and in spite of its oppressive tone at times, it's an uplifting and inspirational film that is likely to win over even the most cynical viewer.",9,0,0,21 July 2010
From Dusk Till Dawn," Fun till the break of dawn.
","On their way out of Texas, leaving a deadly-crime spree in their wake, two brothers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) scoop up an unsuspecting family (led by Harvey Keitel) and make their way across the border into Mexico. Home-free and troubles be damned, they party it up at a local strip joint that is open from dusk till dawn. In the morning, they will receive a generous pay-day, but in the meantime, must fend off a gang of deadly and sometimes seductive vampires.'From Dusk Till Dawn' is a film about vampires, but you tend to forget about that in the first hour, as Tarantino's script focuses sharply on its characters. You'll feel like you're at the table with them as they share shots of whiskey, and when the excrement hits the fan, you're thrown off-balance by the complete 180 the film pulls. Now, depending on your expectations, the third act both ups the ante and makes the film, or it totally shatters the well-developed plot. If you love gore galore (hint: Robert Kurtzman, who provided special effects for the film, also conjured up the original story), this is your film. If anyone knows how to shoot a 'shoot 'em up' flick, it's Robert Rodriguez, and he effortlessly transitions from character moments to over-the-top blood and guts and guns (check out Tom Savini's legendary gear) at the turn of a dime. Truly professional film-making is what we have here.Despite the fact that the film switches it up on you just as you settle in, the end results are so much fun that it's forgivable. If you can't enjoy vampires being jack-hammered with a giant wooden-stake, then this certainly isn't the movie for you. The film is whip-smart, at times hilarious and at others, sincere. It's also got a solid cast worth noting. George Clooney plays against type, and likewise, Tarantino is less annoying than he is in his other acting roles. Harvey Keitel more or less steals the show at times, as the most professional and likable of the bunch, but you'll get a kick, no doubt, in seeing Cheech Marin playing three, count 'em, three roles in the film. 'From Dusk Till Dawn' is essentially a brilliant mash-up of Tarantino's unique story-telling and characters and Robert Rodriguez's signature action and effects sequences, most certainly foreshadowing the duo's epic collaboration, 'Grindhouse,' a decade later. Those expecting anything but a good time will be sorely left in the cold.",8,0,1,19 August 2009
Avatar," Now You Have a Good Reason to Go to the Movies.
","While its initial previews made it look like 'FernGully' meets 'Dances with Wolves' with extra-large Smurfs in action, you can rest assured that James Cameron's epic return to the game, 'Avatar,' is more than meets the eye. With twelve years gone by since the director's previous record smashing film, it's safe to say that his absence has been felt. There are very few directors who throw themselves into their work like Cameron does, and more often than not, his films are not only hits, but cinematic landmarks. Like his special effects break-through in 'Terminator 2 - Judgment Day' and the massive scope and success of 'Titanic,' 'Avatar' is yet another benchmark film.All the work Cameron put into 'Avatar' (which has been on the back-burner since the mid-90's) has no doubt paid off, and if its box office receipts are any indication, this is a movie that is not soon to be forgotten, and is one for the ages that will be appreciated by generation after generation. Yeah, it's that good. If this generation has a 'Star Wars,' then this, my friends, is it. Its visual effects are absolutely stunning and combined with the unique 3D presentation creates a world that you can truly disappear into. At times, you will forget you are watching a movie. You'll feel like you're in the jungle and you'll feel like you're a part of the battle. It's the little the things and the attention to detail that make the film so sweet. James Cameron is a perfectionist, and not for one moment does he let the 3D element of this film go to waste. It's less of a gimmick here and more of a device to transport you into the near-perfect world he has created.While the plot itself isn't ground-breaking material - the man vs. nature thing has been done to death - it is presented in a way that manages to entertain and stimulate the senses while not beating you over the head with its message. It helps, too, that the pacing is smooth and the plot never sags. At about two hours and forty-five minutes long, you never feel the urge to look at the time or think of anything else (especially if you are seeing it in its best element - an IMAX theater). As far as the action sequences go, fans who have been craving a dose of the good stuff since 'Terminator 2' hit theaters back in 1991 will feel more than satisfied, even if the bulk of it is saved for the final act.If there are any flaws to be found, it is in the character department. While some are well-fleshed out and as three-dimensional as the film itself (Worthington, who also starred in the Cameron-less 'Terminator Salvation,' gives a strong and sympathetic performance) there are a few that seem to fall by the wayside. Take the characters played by Joel David Moore ('Hatchet') and Michelle Rodriguez ('The Fast and the Furious'). Both characters fade in and out of the plot, and there are moments where you aren't sure where they stand. I suspect this is a case of the film being edited down to fit a fair time slot (although it could have been longer and not worn out its welcome) and there are some character moments that will be restored in a future 'Director's Cut' of the film.All in all, 'Avatar' is a simply awesome cinematic experience. There have been few films to succeed with such broad goals, and yet, Cameron has managed to come back after many had either written him off or assumed he was done, and changed the game completely. Yes, it's hard to swallow all the hype that has accompanied this project, but if ever there was a film so deserving, it is this. If movies are meant to take you away to a different world to escape reality for a few hours, then 'Avatar' more than does its job. Experience it now, while it's still in theaters. This deserves to be seen on the biggest screen possible, and is a film you won't want to hold out for on DVD.",9,1,2,24 January 2010
Drag Me to Hell," A Hell of a Movie.
","Sam Raimi's long awaited return to the genre that made him isn't so much a scary movie as it is a roller-coaster ride of jumps, laughs and retching that will serve as a reminder to many of us why his ridiculous brand of horror has so sorely been missed.In 'Drag Me To Hell,' Christine (Alison Lohman), a young career girl with a big promotion in sight and a devoted boyfriend (Justin Long), finds herself at the receiving end of the Devil's pimp slap. It seems as though an elderly woman (Lorna Raver) whom she denied a loan extension to has burdened her with a curse that gives her three miserable days before she is, well, dragged to Hell.Without a doubt, Raimi is in full-form here, and in spite of its PG-13 rating, 'Drag Me To Hell' is a hilariously outrageous and intense experience much in the vein of the 'Evil Dead' trilogy. Not only is the film precise in its effort to creep us out (Lorna Raver steals the show), it gives us a relateable heroine to root for and plenty of over-the-top and flat-out gross effects that only serve as the icing on the cake. Its running time will breeze by as you'll find yourself jumping for joy and trying to wipe the smirk off of your fan-boy face as you find a director who is truly in his element here. While the severe amount of hype that arrived in its wake may be too much for some to bare, it's a film that, if approached in the right mind-set (hint: lower your expectations and avoid all reviews -- even this one (oops!)) will prove to be a rewarding experience and easily one of the most entertaining horror movies in recent memory.",8,1,1,22 May 2010
Reservoir Dogs," 'You shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.'
","Only the likes of Quentin Tarantino could make a gangster movie as unconventional and as fresh as 'Reservoir Dogs.' With it's chunky dialogue, unsettling violence, non-linear storyline and excellent performances from it's talented cast, it's everything you would expect from the director and something that more movies should aspire to be.During a daylight jewelry heist, six well-seasoned criminals find themselves at odds when things go terribly wrong. The alarm is tripped, the cops show up and a lot of blood is shed. Despite the fact that they don't know each other's names -- they are instead given color-coded aliases to go by -- they have formed a kinship with one another that is broken within two crucial minutes. Retreating to a nearby warehouse, they tend to one of their own who has been wounded in action while simultaneously trying to figure out which of them is the rat. When talking doesn't settle things, they resort to gun-play, while the true story unfolds behind them. What results is a tightly wound, slow-burning little crime-drama known as 'Reservoir Dogs.'Setting a precedent for crime-dramas, 'Reservoir Dogs' is notable not only for it's unconventional story-telling, but also for the fact that the 'job' is never shown on-screen. Instead, the movie focuses on its characters, played by the likes of Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn and Tarantino himself. Keitel and Buscemi, in particular, are truly natural in their roles and keep the movie feeling genuine and engaging. Madsen plays the unpredictable role of Mr. Blonde almost too realistically, constructing a character that nearly steals the show, and who certainly has one of the most memorable moments of the film. Tim Roth doesn't have much to do here besides gush blood, but in his back-story, shows both strength and vulnerability. Tarantino -- despite being somewhat of an amateur at the time -- finds his vision early on in the film, establishing a style that pays tribute to his influences, while simultaneously breaking new ground only to influence a wave of film-makers in his wake. Made for just under a million, Tarantino stretches an inch into a mile into this amazing little film. It's simple, yet effective. It's loaded with fresh dialogue and a cast that works so well together that you feel like you're in that warehouse with them. Even when you know how the story goes, and it you find yourself watching it over and over again, it never fails to entertain and stimulate the senses, making 'Reservoir Dogs' a certifiable classic.",9,0,0,22 March 2009
Total Recall," Arnie's seeing red.
","By the time the 90's rolled around, action films just didn't get any better than Arnold Schwarzenegger. And when it came to sci-fi and action directors, Paul Verhoeven was certainly at the top of his game. Naturally, the two came together for 'Total Recall,' a unique sci-fi/action-hero story that finds everybody's favorite Austrian on the red planet, battling mutants, struggling with his identity and crusading on behalf of those in need of some clean, breathable and – most importantly – free air.Based on a short story by Philip K. Dick (whose work has made it to the big screen also in the form of 'Minority Report' and 'Blade Runner,' to name a few), 'Total Recall' is a landmark both for its stunning visual effects as well as its non-stop pace and over-the-top action. Arnie is in top form as the everyday man who exchanges routine and security for confusion and paranoia when a vacation company toys with his mind. Rekall, the company in question, will implant a memory – for a price – that will make you think you had an incredible vacation (or in this case, an action-packed adventure that will satisfy all your wildest cravings) when it was all just a pricey dream. Unfortunately, things go very wrong very quickly for our hero. His wife (Sharon Stone) turns against him, as it turns out she is a secret agent who has been spying on him throughout their marriage. In turn, he finds himself being chased by a gang of cronies -- led by Michael Ironside -- to what appears to be his home planet, where he hooks up with an ex-lover (Rachel Ticotin) and makes acquaintances with a three-breasted prostitute, a cab-driver with bad teeth and a really grotesque and unappealing mutant (who can also be seen in the 'Aspen' episode of 'South Park'). Is it real, is it a dream? What makes this film truly genius and leaves room for many a repeat viewing is that, in the end, it's totally up to the viewer.Verhoeven throws everything AND the kitchen sink at his film. 'Total Recall' is as chock-full of mind-games as it is action, and is possibly the man's finest film to date. Even today, 19 years (!) later, it still holds up, both in its story and in its visuals. Those seeking some escapism but with a film that carries as much brain as it does brawn, can do no wrong with 'Total Recall.' One of the finest from one of the greatest action heroes of our time and one of the most under-rated directors in his time. Spawned from the film was a short-lived TV series as well as a classic musical parody, titled 'Total Recallin'' – set to the tune of Tom Petty's 'Free Fallin'' -- which can be found on any video-viewing website.",9,3,6,3 July 2009
Rocky," Rocky Rocks!
","A crowning achievement that, amongst other accolades, earned the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1976, 'Rocky' tells the story of Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), a washed-up boxer who serves as a strong-arm for a loan shark by day and fights for cash in dingy clubs by night. When flashy heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) challenges him to fight, Rocky finally has a chance to prove to himself and the world that he is still worthy. With the aid of an aging trainer (Burgess Meredith), a hot-headed but loyal friend (Burt Young) and a mousy pet-store clerk, Adrian (Talia Shire) Rocky goes the distance in a bid at self-redemption.Rocky Balboa's rags-to-riches story echoes that of Sylvester Stallone's professional career. A virtually unknown at the time, Stallone was propelled to superstardom following the film's success at the box office, and got his foot in the door not only as an iconic action hero, but also as a prolific writer/director (he would later go on to direct four out of five 'Rocky' sequels while writing and starring in all of them). His portrayal of the titular character earned him an Oscar nod, and it's easy to see why. Charismatic and ultimately human as the underdog hero, this is the stuff screen legends are made of.The script, written by Stallone himself, is focused more on the everyday life of Balboa and less on the sport itself. A boxing film with very little boxing, 'Rocky' is more of a character piece where we spend the bulk of the film getting to know and sympathize with our lead so that when the third act kicks in with a rousing montage and a whopper of a fight, you're cheering him on every step of the way. The film is aided by a nostalgic soundtrack and a slight-of-hand by director John G. Avildsen. Avildsen could very well milk the sappiness at hand, but instead, keeps the film feeling raw and real, yet inspiring at the same time.'Rocky' is, in a nutshell, a classic for the ages. It's easily Stallone's finest film and certainly had an immense impact on pop culture. Even if you don't particularly appreciate boxing or any sport for that matter, you'll find it to be a worthy, involving and inspiring underdog tale. 'Rocky' is a true knock-out, time and time again.",9,1,1,11 March 2010
The Descent," 'The Descent' reaches new heights of horror.
","Sarah (Shauna MacDonald) could use some cheering up. Just one year ago, she lost her husband and her only daughter to a bad car accident. In an effort to cheer her up, five of her best friends take her on a vacation into the Appalachian Mountains for some routine spelunking. Things go horribly wrong, however, when they find themselves trapped and without a map inside one of the caves. Unfortunately for them, this cave has yet to be thoroughly explored and an unknown threat lurks in the darkness, ready to attack and threaten their solidarity and sanity.Writer/director Neil Marshall spends ample time building up the characters to the point where they feel real, but also wastes no time in getting to the point. It isn't long before our characters are submersed into the abyss from which they spend 90 minutes of the film trying to escape. A claustrophobic's nightmare come true, the film makes sure you're in the cave with the characters as they fight for their lives with a careful balance of character development and spooky atmosphere, achieved by its stunning cinematography and authentic location. By the time you get to the gore and the creature effects, the movie has already done its job and the rest is just icing on the cake.In fact, that's pretty much what sets 'The Descent' apart from most modern horror stories. Rather than relying on outlandish death scenes and over-the-top gore, it's slightly restrained in its old-school approach that values tension over eye-candy. To be blunt, the death scenes are probably the last thing you'll remember from this film. What you'll likely take away from it is an unmistakable and unforgiving tone, a healthy portion of unforgettable imagery (see: climbing up a hill of human skulls) and an ending that will stay with you for days. It's a well-rounded, well-written and effectively directed film that warrants repeat viewings to absorb it all. With this film, Neil Marshall has certainly earned himself a spot in the echelon of iconic horror movie directors, and is truly a visionary to keep an eye on.A sequel is currently on the horizon, although what would possess Sarah to enter that cave again remains to be seen, especially if you are to go by the original ending -- found in the 'Original Unrated Cut' (the true version of the film) -- which leaves nowhere for a sequel to go. By itself, though, it stands alone as a modern classic for a reason and a film that will effectively creep out and thrill audiences for many decades to come. When this decade is looked back upon in future years, 'The Descent' will no doubt sit at the top of the pile of films that helped define horror movie cinema in the new millennium.",10,8,12,9 September 2009
Rocky III," Depite a Premise Wearing Thin, 'Rocky III' is a Champion.
","I pity the fool that can't enjoy this movie. I sincerely do.The third sequel in the ever-popular 'Rocky' franchise, aptly titled 'Rocky III,' finds Sylvester Stallone yet again stepping up to the plate as the notorious Italian Stallion as well as behind the scenes as both writer and director. As with 'Rocky II,' the gang's all here with all the major players from the previous film in tow as well as a couple of memorable newcomers in Mr. T and Hulk Hogan.Opening with a montage set to Survivor's 'Eye of the Tiger' (written specifically for use in the film) all of the necessary exposition one would need with this film is provided quickly enough so that the film can get underway with its quickly-paced, action packed and drama fueled plot. Following the events of the previous film, Rocky Balboa is riding high on success, raising his son and living the good life in the lush mansion he shares with his wife, Adrian. On the day he is rewarded with a statue erected in his honor and announces his retirement, he is challenged by a vicious newcomer, Clubber Lang (Mr. T), who quickly gives our hero a run for his money which in turn has him training with an unlikely new ally: Apollo Creed.No doubt, the film is lacking some of the substance of the previous films, but three films into a franchise, it's only natural. Thankfully, 'Rocky III' is entertaining enough that it doesn't wear out its welcome. From the colorful characters portrayed by both Mr. T and Hulk Hogan (who would each go on to become icons of the 80's in their own right) to the continuing saga of our main character and his newfound camaraderie with his previous enemy, there's enough juice in the film's tank to keep it running until the end. Fans of the original and even its sequel will notice a significant step-down in quality, yet, it's still a film that's hard not to enjoy.",7,0,0,11 March 2010
The Matrix Reloaded," 'Reloaded' is a bit bloated.
","'Hmmm, upgrades.' - NeoFour years passing after the wild success of 'The Matrix' allowed the Wachowski Brothers enough time and enough creative freedom to construct the concluding chapters in their trilogy exactly how they wanted to. Did they use their time effectively? Was the wait worth it? In the case of 'The Matrix Reloaded,' the answer is leaning more towards a 'no.' Heavy on action scenes, light on the thought-provoking dialogue, there is no doubt that this sequel is a different kind of film than it's predecessor, which is vexing, as it comes from the exact same people who brought you the first. On the surface, it's a loud, rip-roaring summer blockbuster with outstanding visual effects and mind-blowing action sequences. But what it has in brawn it severely lacks in brain. A story that is basically bookended by Neo's (Keanu Reeves) desire to save his love interest, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), 'The Matrix Reloaded' takes a lot of time to get to its point. What little plot is being pushed is constantly interrupted by giant stunt showcases or martial arts extravaganzas. 'The Matrix Reloaded' is a testament to all that is possible with modern film-making, and to that end, it succeeds.What it fails at is telling a compelling story. The plot relies too heavily at times on external media (i.e. video games and an anime home video by the name of 'The Animatrix') and in all honesty, could have been condensed into the closing chapter, 'The Matrix Revolutions,' thereby almost negating its existence. What we are left with instead is a film that is half the sum of its predecessor, and which may dazzle the audio and visual senses, but hardly stimulates the brain like a 'Matrix' movie should. 'The Matrix Reloaded' stands strong as an action epic  the true summer blockbuster it is  but disappoints when the time comes to tell its story.",6,0,0,12 March 2009
Scream 2," 'Scream 2' overcomes some obstacles to end up a respectable sequel and counterpart.
","Wes Craven's 'Scream' was such a smashing success that a sequel was quickly rushed into production, and in 1997, 'Scream 2' was born. Re-uniting Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson, the film also saw the return of its surviving stars as well as the now-iconic Ghostface killer, who, for obvious reasons, carries an alternate identity than that of the killer(s) in the first film. Stalking Sidney and her friends at college, the film centers around the damaged character and the paranoia that continues to cripple her life. As Deputy Dewey puts it: 'You probably already know him...or her...or them. They're probably already in your life. They get off on that.'The film can't help but feel redundant when compared to its predecessor, especially when it comes to its surprise finish. That's not to say the film is a complete re-hash though. Thankfully, it still puts your expectations through the loops and keeps you on the edge of your seat with some nail-biting suspense and gruesome blood-shed. In fact, when you compare it to other like-minded films of the time (see: 'Scream' rip-offs), it's downright nasty and fun at the same time! The college campus setting also helps change things up a bit, and with so many horror sequels ripe for the picking, 'Scream 2' is to horror sequels what 'Scream' was to horror movies in general. It ups the ante, raises your expectations and (for the most part) meets them.The direction by Craven seems a little more confident this go-round, which is unfortunate since Williamson's script gives its characters clunky and awkward dialogue to spit, which severely drags down the film. The first one was whip-smart, but this one's a little milder. The tone of the flick and the overall plot is just-right; it's in the little things that bog the flick down. Even still, its flaws are minor, and it's got another great, talented cast, some of whom meet unfortunate and grisly demises. Keep an eye out for wacky Aunt Jackie from 'Roseanne' herself, Laurie Metcalf, in a seemingly minor but memorable role.",7,1,2,19 June 2009
Scream," A seminal slasher flick for the 90's.
","By the time we had reached 1996, the horror genre was in a pretty stagnant state. With nothing to define the decade but cheap sequels and even cheaper direct-to-video productions, the timing was just right for a film to come along that both defined its era and spun the genre on its head. In the 60's, it was 'Psycho.' In the 70's, 'Halloween.' The 80's were owned by 'Friday the 13th' and 'A Nightmare on Elm Street.' Enter 'Scream,' the one true stand-out genre flick of its time, a film that has incited as much praise as it has criticism from horror fan-boys, as well as inspiring and reviving a whole new breed of self-aware slasher films that were, sadly, not nearly as good as this big-boy.After losing control of the franchise he started with 'A Nightmare On Elm Street,' director Wes Craven got his groove back with 'Scream,' settling in as the director of its two sequels and earning himself back some of the credibility that the late 80's and early 90's stripped him of. With a clever script from newcomer Kevin Williamson, it was the first slasher film where its characters were aware of what was happening to them. Heck, they even invoke a set of rules to survive a horror film, while blatantly taking stabs at the well-worn classics of the horror genre. While this formula became rather redundant by the time 'Scream 2' rolled around (let alone, 'I Know What You Did Last Summer,' 'Urban Legend' and the like) it was rather inventive and fresh for its time, and taken in the correct context, makes for a brilliant and unique slasher film.You'll spend the bulk of the film trying to guess the identity of the killer, but thankfully the script is smart enough to lead you astray and only by blind luck would you be able to identify him/her. The death scenes are surprisingly intense considering how neutered the genre was at the time, and in its most notorious scene – the opening – does away with a big-name star in a way that sets the tone for the rest of the film by leaving you with the feeling that anything can happen. Part mystery, part comedy, part slasher, 'Scream' pays tribute to its influences but has enough of a sense of humor to poke fun at the clichés in the genre. One of Wes Craven's finest films, and certainly a definitive film for the 90's, not just in the horror genre, but in general.",9,1,2,19 June 2009
Halloween," What's the Boogeyman?
","If you separate John Carpenter's 'Halloween' from it's many sequels, remake and the many copy-cat films from the 80's, you are left with one Hell of a suspenseful flick. And if anyone knew suspense back in the day, it was Carpenter. Like his other, older fare, 'Halloween' is a slow-burning, tense little thriller that explodes at the very end, making it a movie worth repeating again and again. Thirty years later, despite the fact the film looks a bit old, it still holds up. Having seen it myself hundreds of times (really) I can say that there are still parts that remind me of why my first viewing of the film as a child was so memorable. Afterall, before Michael Myers was stalking his 'other' sister or was driven by some mysterious cult, he was at his best stalking a group of babysitters and anyone who got in his path for no reason at all. We watch in an opening scene as Michael brutally slaughters his oldest sister and then looks completely emotionless when he is done. After fifteen years of being locked away in Smith's Grove Sanitarium, he escapes, steals his doctor's station wagon and heads to his hometown of Haddonfield to carry on his grisly killing spree. There is no motivation or reason at all as to why he stalks Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her friends. Keeping that in mind -- and forgetting the back-story that was created in the sequel -- the movie is much more chilling. Stalking the teenagers during the day with an altered William Shatner mask and a mechanic's jumpsuit, he slips into virtual anonymity, unrecognized even as he passes by his own doctor, Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence). Eventually darkness falls on Haddonfield and as the trick-or-treaters leave the streets and everyone settles into their homes, Michael begins the bloodshed. Despite not being an overly gory film, 'Halloween' still has a mean streak. Not only are children put in danger, but a dog also meets his fate by Myers' hands. The death scenes were pretty grisly for their time and are built up by an un-matched amount of suspense. 'Halloween' is the true predecessor to 'Psycho' and part of the reason horror exists today. John Carpneter's film -- with the help of the late Debra Hill -- was and still remains an innovative landmark that is as timeless as it's concept. Granted, with today's audience and the glut of sequels that followed, it's original vision has become foggy, but viewed in the context of it's time, 'Halloween' is, quite simply, the best of it's kind.",10,0,1,20 October 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," Needs more Reginald VelJohnson.
","With action films and their aging stars back on the rise thanks to Sylvester Stallone's recent franchise resurrections in 'Rambo' and 'Rocky Balboa', it seemed only natural that Bruce Willis take John McClane out of a twelve-year retirement for a 'Die Hard 4' -- or 'Live Free Or Die Hard' -- even if it means being hindered by a careless studio and a ridiculous PG-13 rating. Surely twelve years is a long time, long enough for a new generation of action fans to be spawned who are offended by some flesh-wounds and f-words, right? All fan-boy venting put on hold, 'Live Free Or Die Hard' isn't as horrible a film as it was set up to be. Despite the fact that Bruce Willis is the ONLY person to make a return to the franchise and it's obvious that 20th Century Fox wanted to make a cheap hit, it kind of worked. With director Len Wiseman ('Underworld') at the helm, this fourth installment in the once-great 'Die Hard' series is simultaneously consumable by today's audience and somewhat gratifying for those who remember McClane's glory days. It doesn't look like a Die Hard film -- heck, it barely even feels like one -- but Wiseman injects enough freshness to make it, at the very least, an entertaining and visually pleasing affair. Bruce Willis returns to the title role, and what can be said about that? The role of John McClane is so ingrained in him at this point, that all he has to do is show up, be Bruce Willis and the job is done. This time around, McClane is matching wits with a terrorist (Timothy Olyphant) outcast from the U.S. government, and Hell-bent on pulling a Tyler Durden and re-setting America's system. Justin Long plays a hacker caught in the path, and despite appearing mis-cast, actually benefits from a different role for a change and has a few exchanges with Willis that keep the movie fresh and give it that 'Die Hard' sense-of-humor that is so sorely missed. Kevin Smith has a brief part as a super-nerd prepared for the end of the world and, in all honesty, nearly steals the show. Had they put Smith in Long's role and Long in Smith's, the film may have been the better for it, but I digress. The rest as follows is business as usual for a 'Die Hard' movie. McClane proves indestructible, saves the day, so on and so forth. And would you want it any other way? Despite the action being tamed down to accommodate the more conservative rating, it's still an engaging little affair. Not the best in the series, by any means, but certainly a fun way to kill a few hours with one of the best action heroes Hollywood has to offer. What the movie lacks in originality and story, it makes up for in it's style and in Bruce Willis' charm. A movie that is surely worth a rental, if not more. A solid action film is hard to come by, and despite it's short-comings, 'Live Free Or Die Hard' will leave the action-junkie satisfied.",6,1,3,17 December 2008
A Night at the Roxbury," A decent 'SNL' movie that brings back a rush of memories.
","'A Night At The Roxbury' is yet another in a string of 'Saturday Night Live' sketches to make it to the big screen. Not as classic as 'Wayne's World,' while not as terrible as 'It's Pat!,' this flick finds a happy medium. It's not comedy gold, but at the same time, it's mindless and innocent fun. Those who are fans of late 90's 'SNL' in particular will revel in the nostalgia it induces. And even if you're not of that percentage, it's worth a gander to see Will Ferrell in one of his earliest movie roles, as one of two Butabi brothers, opposite Chris Kattan, who has sadly faded away in comparison to Ferrell's success.About the movie: The Butabi brothers live a simple life. By night, they cruise the city, hopping from nightclub to nightclub, failing to gain entry to the holy grail that is The Roxbury. By day they sleep it all off, while managing to find time to work in the plastic plant store owned by their father. Their dream of becoming night-club hot-shots comes true when Richard Grieco (of '21 Jump Street' fame) rear-ends them, and in lieu of a lawsuit, agrees to get the brothers into their dream club. From there they make a new, high-profile connection, hook up with a couple of gold-diggers who give them some much needed life-experience while simultaneously proving to the world that they aren't massive failures and/or losers. Starring opposite Ferrell and Kattan are other 'SNL' alumni Molly Shannon, Colin Quinn and Mark McKinney, as well as Lochlyn Munro, Dan Hedaya, Loni Anderson, Michael Clark Duncan, Eva Mendes ad Jennifer Coolidge. The movie has got limited appeal and screams '1990's' but if you're willing enough to let your guard down and enjoy a light-weight buddy comedy, 'A Night At The Roxbury' will do just fine. With Will Ferrell showing some early comedic chops and obvious improvisation, as well as a strong nostalgic sense, it's the kind of movie that is hard not to at least crack a smile at.",6,1,1,27 March 2009
A Nightmare on Elm Street," The Suburban Nightmare
","Let's take a trip back in time, 24 years ago to be precise. The horror genre had established slasher movie icons such as Michael Myers and Jason Vorhees as the new standard and the horror genre itself was rapidly evolving. Enter a seasoned, yet underrated filmmaker in Wes Craven. Craven's gift to the genre in 'A Nightmare On Elm Street' was a colorful and unique villain in Freddy Krueger, brought to life by the incomparable Robert Englund. Instead of merely dispatching horny babysitters and camp counselors with long, sharp objects, Freddy dwelled in the dream world, haunting the children of those who burned him to death in his previous life. Part cautionary tale, part suburban nightmare, 'Elm Street' had a little something to creep out everyone. Who can deny the psychological implications of avoiding sleep at all costs? The mere idea that  despite the fantastical elements  such a seemingly safe environment could host such evil is almost a wake up call to never fall asleep or become complacent. Almost as chilling as the concept itself were the ways in which Freddy would dispatch of his victims. Donning a glove with razor sharp blades for each finger and using the unlimited possibilities of the dream world, nothing was off-limits. From bloodbaths that reached the ceiling to a rather nasty fire, Freddy created the ultimate, inescapable nightmare.Watching the film today, it still holds up. Yes, the effects are as dated as the overall style of the film. But below the surface is still a quality film that stands well enough on it's own. Heather Langenkamp plays Nancy, one of the more independent and strong 'survivor girls' of the 80's slasher boom. Langenkamp possesses a rare charm, and as the archetypal girl-next-door, she sells an out-of-this-world concept by keeping her performance grounded in reality. Many will note her co-star, her boyfriend across the street, a very young Johnny Depp. Depp also brings a sense of realism to the table, delivering some early, if somewhat choppy acting skills. Granted, it helps that Craven was and is amongst the more intelligent of horror directors, and his vision is still relevant today. The idea that a new generation can inherit the burdens of their parents is a timeless theme that remains potent. The key factor here is that the movie is just as intelligent as it is shocking for it's time. As for Freddy, he is the ultimate boogeyman. He is the evil that never truly dies and Englund plays the part to the creepiest degree, you know, before he became the class-clown of the genre. Although the overall impact of the film was watered down by sequel after sequel, this one still retains it's class. Unlike most films of it's time, it never sacrificed story for obligatory gore, or nudity for that matter. Despite looking somewhat dated by today's standard, there isn't much else that dates the film, no cheesy pop songs, catch phrases or hair styles. It's just a straight-forward, true horror movie that packs a mind-blowing punch in a briskly-paced 90 minutes. The birth of a legendary villain, a timeless concept, 'A Nightmare On Elm Street,' nearly two and a half decades later, is a cornerstone of modern American horror, a true essential.",9,0,0,12 October 2008
The Matrix," Even 10 years later, a classic that retains it's relevance.
","'I know what you're thinking, 'cause right now I'm thinking the same thing. Actually, I've been thinking it ever since I got here: Why oh why didn't I take the blue pill?' - CypherIf there was one sci-fi movie that defined the 90's, it would have to 'The Matrix,' arriving late in the game in the year of 1999. With school-shootings and 'Y2K' bugs baring down on the masses, it was only appropriate that a sleeper-hit such as this one came along to truly capture and define the end of the century. Whether it was fate or chance, the brothers Wachowski managed to create a film that not only captured the imaginations of its audience as well as played off its fears, but a film that -- ten years later -- holds up and marks a high point in American film-making. Simultaneously matching and surpassing the groundbreaking special effects and outlandish action-sequences of 1991's 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day,' 'The Matrix' set a precedent that no modern film has yet to live up to, despite the mixed feelings that stem from its two sequels.Imagine everything you know is not real. A fabrication, as a matter of fact. Your whole life, you've been asleep, dreaming that you're living out your rote, uneventful existence. You constantly search for answers, for the meaning of your own existence, to no avail. That is, until somebody opens your eyes, waking you to a new reality, a new world. A world where you are an unknowing slave to technology (subtle social commentary, eh?) and the world you thought you knew is nothing more than a computer program fed to you while you sleep. Such is the premise of 'The Matrix.' Keanu Reeves plays Thomas Andersen, a computer hacker who lives at his computer and could care less to socialize, let alone get up and go to work each day. He lives in cyberspace under the codename 'Neo,' not realizing that he himself is being pursued. Soon, he is extracted from the fabricated world  The Matrix  and faces a harsh reality through the assistance of a philosophical leader by the name of 'Morpheus' (Laurence Fishburne) and a fellow hacker, 'Trinity' (Carrie-Anne Moss), where he comes to learn his purpose is astronomical, Christ-like, even. He does battle against the agents  led by the sinister Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) -- who keep The Matrix in check, all in an effort to salvage what remains of the free-thinking human race.Notorious for its mind-bending special effects as much as it is for its philosophical and religious undertones, 'The Matrix' is a film that, as it nears its tenth anniversary, remains relevant today. With repeated viewings, the film still looks fresh and feels brand new. Despite the fact that the 'Man vs. Machine' theme present has been done to death in other films, it is tackled by the script in a way that is both unconventional and definitive. Its impact was immediately felt on pop-culture, and still resonates today. It's more than just loud, shoot-em-up fun with stunning visuals. It's also a timeless portrait of where society currently sits and where its unknown future is heading. Social commentary aside, though, it's still incredible entertainment. A well-rounded, well-made film that will stretch the imagination for years and whose impact should hold up as a benchmark for future classics to live up to.",9,2,5,11 March 2009
Heat," Pure intensity.
","In what is arguably one of the finest heist movies in history, 'Heat' pits two acting heavy-weights in Robert De Niro and Al Pacino against one another. One is a professional thief, so well seasoned that he has avoided the law for as long as he can probably remember. The other is a troubled homicide detective whose third marriage is fizzling out due to his over-riding commitment to his job. Each character ultimately finds he has more in common with his adversary than with his peers. Both are flawed, tired and run-down middle-aged men who, in the immortal words of Roger Murtaugh (see: 'Lethal Weapon') are 'getting too old for this .''Heat' is hardly your average cops and robbers tale. It's long, it's sweeping and is steeped in character moments and conversations. While much of the hype about the film has always revolved around its finale – the bank robbery – it's the small moments that make the film. Take for instance a scene in the middle of the film where Pacino, too tired and beat down to do anything else, tracks down his suspect (De Niro) and invites him for a cup of coffee where the two talk shop and in spite of mutual respect for one another, both vow not to back down. This moment serves to build the tension that is the big pay-off in the film. You get to know and feel for these very real and very flawed characters, so that when the heat is on, so to speak, you don't know who to cheer for anymore.Undeniably, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are the stars of the film and are a large part of its greatness, but it is also Michael Mann's ('Collateral,' 'Manhunter') unique eye and story-telling sense that defines the film as well. Despite his insuppressible style, the film still retains a gritty, realistic air that is best evidenced in a shootout that takes place in the Los Angeles streets. Without a doubt, this is the director's masterpiece and definitely one of the best of its kind. It's a true epic that is filed to the brim with intense acting (nobody's forgotten about you either, Val) and complicated characters as intricate as the job they are trying to do. For all intents and purposes, 'Heat' lives up to its name.",10,4,8,13 October 2009
Jackie Brown," Taratino's Coming of Age
","'Jackie Brown,' Quentin Tarantino's third feature length film, finds the writer/director at perhaps his most straight-forward and mature. While he rejects the notion that he is maturing as a film-maker in an interview featured on the DVD, it is quite obvious that the man who created such cult classics as 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Reservoir Dogs' was out to prove he wasn't merely a one-trick pony, and it paid off in one of his most character driven and rewarding efforts to date.Adapted from the Elmore Leonard novel, 'Rum Punch,' 'Jackie Brown' is the story of an aging stewardess (Pam Grier) in trouble with the law who concocts a scheme to rip off an arms dealer (Samuel L. Jackson) of a cool $500,000. She of course needs the help of a bail bondsman (Robert Forster) whose midlife crisis takes a backseat to the crush he develops for her. On the surface, it appears to be just another heist film, but underneath all the layers, at its core, 'Jackie Brown' is an unlikely love story from probably the last director you'd expect. While the job and the way it's carried out is a big part of the film, Tarantino knows well enough to allow his characters ample time to breathe, making it the sort of film where you forget for a while who you're watching and simply appreciate the unique personalities they bring to life.It also helps, of course, that the film is filled to brim with a great cast of old and new, obscure and respectable. Robert De Niro has perhaps one of the most entertaining roles as an ex-con who keeps to himself, silently observing and judging the world he is getting reacquainted with. Bridget Fonda plays Samuel L. Jackson's sex-pot/pot-head surfer girl girlfriend with a dry sense of humor that bounces well off of De Niro's stone-cold demeanor. Grier and Forster, who were both dragged from the depths of obscurity only to find their careers slightly revitalized for the film are both in top form and go a long way in driving home the human nature of the plot. Michael Keaton, playing an ATF agent who would later appear as the same character in 1998's 'Out of Sight,' is perhaps one of the film's greatest surprises, as he is in turns quirky and overly confident, while being clueless all the while.While fans of Tarantino's more notorious fare will have a hard time seeing the brilliance of 'Jackie Brown,' it's a film that will no doubt please the palate of the viewer who craves rich characters, natural pacing and an engrossing plot, not to mention a killer soundtrack. Out of all of Tarantino's work, this is the one that is the most grounded in reality and, aside from Forster's Oscar nomination, deserved much more acclaim and credit than it was given. In a way, this is the cult classic in Tarantino's league of cult classics, and a film that certainly holds up time and time again.",9,0,0,2 November 2009
Goodfellas," Timeless and epic, brutal and unflinching.
","As far back as Henry Hill can remember, he always wanted to be a gangster. His dreams are realized early on in his childhood as he ascends the ranks of the mafia in Brooklyn, NY and then finds his life descending into a downward spiral that forces him out of society altogether. This is his true story, adapted from a novel by Nicholas Pileggi and brought to the screen by writer/director Martin Scorsese.Authenticity plays a big role in the film. Because it is a true story about real people, it would be nothing if the characters didn't feel authentic. Thankfully we have the great Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci (who subsequently won an Oscar for his role) along with Ray Liotta (in, no doubt, his finest role) bringing the players in the film to life so naturally. Nothing these actors do is over-done nor glamorized in any way. In fact, it's almost as if the trio personally knew the people they were portraying before committing their interpretations to film. For all of their character flaws and ugliness, nothing is sugar-coated, and the film is the better for it. Of course, it helps with a solid supporting cast that includes Paul Sorvino, Lorraine Bracco, and Frank Sivero. Bracco, in particular, gives the viewer someone to live through the experience with, as she witnesses and comes to term with the shocking reality she must adapt to. The film is no doubt violent and brutal, but is delivered with a touch of class as only Martin Scorsese can bring to the game. This film alone is a testament to his status as one of America's finest film-makers. Conjuring up images that will stay with you long after your first viewing, Scorsese makes the ultra-violence as real as it should be and brings only the finest performances out of even the smallest players in the pack. Helping to commit the film to memory is a brilliant soundtrack of popular tunes that spans three decades and serves as a stunning example of popular music used effectively in cinema. If you remember one thing about 'Goodfellas,' it may very well be Eric Clapton's 'Layla' and the grisly and haunting images that accompany it.Without a doubt, 'Goodfellas' is one of the finest mob films ever made and, at the very least, is certainly one of Scorsese's best. From the cast to the music and everything in between, it is complete, sweet and sensational perfection. View it, and you'll see why it was such a smashing success and why it is still considered a classic almost 20 years later.",10,0,0,26 August 2009
Evil Dead II," 'Swallow This!'
","After a brief prologue that serves as half remake, half re-cap, 'Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn' continues the unfortunate adventures of Ash (Bruce Campbell) and the demons that inhabit the cabin he once shared with his friends. Much more stylized and over-the-top than it's predecessor, 'Evil Dead 2' is certainly not for everyone. However, if you've seen enough horror movies in your day and can recognize and appreciate pure entertainment when you see it, you'll have a blast with this sequel.What is normally sacrilege for horror movies is a gift here. Forsaking a conventional plot, 'Evil Dead 2' instead delivers shock after shock topped with mountains of gore, so much so that if it were real, any sane person would start vomiting. By the time we're well into the second act, the cabin is wall to wall with blood and the first film has officially been outdone. Don't be mistaken, however; this movie is not just gore for the sake of gore. It's always there to serve a punchline and to further stimulate the over-caffeinated vibe the movie has going for it. And if you thought the first movie was brutal, brace yourself, because its sequel doubles up on just about everything. To describe what happens in this movie doesn't do it justice. Hell, no mind-altering substance known to man can compete with 'Evil Dead 2'!Returning to his signature role, Campbell plays Ash quite differently than in the first film. Becoming the anti-hero, Ash whips out quotable line after quotable line, becoming an instant fan-boy favorite. Along with an ever-resilient Campbell, director Sam Raimi is back in the saddle and he's letting loose. For whatever reason, it seems like Raimi has more artistic confidence and less pressure and, in turn, delivers one of the purest, most unbridled horror film of the 80's. 'Evil Dead 2' plays almost as a gift to horror fans who had become complacent and grown tired of the typical slasher fare of the 80's. Almost as an oasis of the genre, it's a movie that you can come to time and time again when you're not in the mood for anything in particular, but know you want to have a good time.",8,1,2,31 October 2008
V for Vendetta," Explosive, so to speak.
","'Are you like...a crazy person?' - Evey'I'm quite sure they'll say so.' - V Taking place in 2038 and set in a totalitarian-ruled London, 'V For Vendetta' centers around its title character, the masked anarchist known only as V (Hugo Weaving) and his efforts to take down the dictatorship of Adam Sutler (John Hurt). Based on a graphic novel written by Alan Moore (Watchmen, From Hell), but ultimately revamped from its original story by the Wachowski Brothers ('The Matrix' trilogy), 'V For Vendetta' is both smart and highly stylized. The film takes many liberties with its source material, adjusting Alan Moore's original vision to suit modern times. To say 'V For Vendetta' is a parable for the political landscape of the Bush-era would be ultimately accurate.Natalie Portman stars as the TV-reporter turned sympathizer when the mysterious V comes to her rescue, while simultaneously introducing her to his (under)world, but it is Hugo Weaving behind the mask who really brings the movie to life. Wearing a black cloak and a Guy Fawkes mask, there isn't much room for expression, but Weaving manages to be both sublime and intense in his role. What could verge on over-acting in any other actor's hands is instead iconic in Weaving's portrayal. Portman is also great, as are John Hurt and Stephen Fry -- playing another of V's allies in the role of a talk-show host -- but ultimately the film gives way to V and his vendetta. Its message may sag and it may get hidden beneath all the spectacular stunts and explosions, but a story that ultimately centers itself on inner strength and the will to fight oppression emerges. It may not be in line with Moore's original vision (Moore subsequently dis-owned the flick) but is suited for modern times. Directed by John McTeigue (who served as assistant director on 'Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones' and all three 'Matrix' films), its got an abundance of shocking and memorable visuals, as well as stunts galore. Thankfully, it has just as much brain as it has brawn, and while being uneven at times, still remains relevant. As far as comic book adaptations go, this one belongs at the top of the pile.",8,1,7,7 April 2009
