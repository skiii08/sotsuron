Blade Runner 2049," Must watch classic for Future
","Blade runner 2049 is a sequel to 1982's classic Blade Runner which ultimately proves to be an perfect example of what an sequel should be. Ryan gosling has played role of Blade Runner himself in this movie chasing replicants when he comes across new case which changes his entire life and later the story that unfolds is suspenseful, thrilling and exciting to watch. However movie is almost 3 hours so it will test your patience. Very few movies are out there which always stay top of your mind so if anyone asks for suggestion for what they should watch you would immediately refer them that movie and this is the movie that is just like that. I have divided this movie in simple aspects to evaluate on and you can see for yourself if it fits your category.*NOTE* As its sequel you should watch Blade runner (1982) first and watching this prequel is worth only later to watch this Blade Runner 2049.
Entertaining ?Absolutely if you have a knack for thriller, mystery and suspense stories. Visual effects in the movie are close to perfection and so appealing that nowhere color or filters will let you down and not to mention the imaginative world created which adds more to the story of previous film.Story ?
Sometimes direction and cinematography is so appealing that story seems dull and STORY is king of all and here story and character driven this marvelous piece rises above all and this story is better than previous which is debatable. The dystopian utopian/dystopian setting of the film is amazing.
Boring ?Considering duration of 3 hours it's no wonder it might be boring for some people and i do agree on it, it could have been a little short around 2 hours but it is one of the quality that I think is only positive not negative and it will be boring if you like movies like fast and Furious franchise as there is no final showdown where action packed battles happen.In conclusion, I will say its is a classic for future and even in 2049 this movie would be remembered as one of the top movies and I highly suggest everyone to watch this.",10,0,4,26 January 2018
Vanilla Sky," A must watch Psychological thriller
","Vanilla Sky is an American Psychological thriller movie released back in 2001. The story of the movie revolves around and is focused on the life of David Ames played by Tom Cruise who is inherits his father's wealth. One day at his party he is introduced by his friend to Sofia Serrano with whom David falls in love with at first sight but at the same time he is avoiding Julie Gianni who supposedly has a thing for david because of their shared past together. Following some incidents the next day, David and Julie together meet an car accident which mutilates his face and after waking up up from comma he discovers that Julie died in that car accident. All of this is story told by David to his Psychologist in Jail where he is convicted for Julie's death. David has trouble remembering the incidents of the past and various incidents from different time period and with him we are set on a quest on finding out the reason why Julie died.Vanilla sky was an absolute treat an individual who enjoys cinema and whose favourite genre is psychological thriller. However movie does lack in a little visual department as movie could have been a little bit more dramatic with darker tone as everything just appears so normal that the viewer might forget he actually is watching a movie. As story progresses a lot of twists happen which can throw audience wondering and shocked. Unlike many other psychological thriller there is always one maniac with their own ideology and thoughts but David as a protagonist discovers his own different identity due to memory loss. Many memories of david are changed or replaced by himself for which movie hints multiple times at human's subconscious and how dangerous it is.
Acting in the movie is something that has to mention as Tom Cruise totally nails it as an guy with disfigured face.For some reason the first part of the movie is great but later for which david is having remembering issue is addressed very poorly as movie completely changes its tone from Mystery psychological thriller to this Science fiction setting and such transition will obviously not be appreciated by most of the audience however i liked it but people won't because it was not executed properly and most of the time went in establishing character of david in 1st half of the movie itself.
Vanilla sky in the end becomes one of those movies which had great and unique concept for which it is expressed very nicely but later half brings it down and for that reason the next time someone asks me to suggest them an psychological thriller movie, I won't definitely suggest them Vanilla Sky and the reason is that because I love this movie for what it is no matter how much I criticize it and if someone else complains about it, I won't be able to take that. The ending is of movie is totally like many great films where you are given answers and are left to wonder and imagine story according to yourself. And yes I do recommend it.",8,0,0,26 January 2018
