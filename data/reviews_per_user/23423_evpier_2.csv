War Dogs," Rated #8. Really???
","I guess it's a good indication of our society's current status when you have this movie (which isn't't worth a 2nd watch) ranked higher than Saving Private Ryan, Braveheart, Apocalypse Now, Platoon & Full Metal Jacket in the war category. It's comical that this one is even in the top 100. Its not a terrible movie, but I have no interest in seeing it twice (unlike the aforementioned that I'll watch every time I see them on the channel guide). There must be a lot of kids that like Jonah Hill voting on here. That can be the only explanation.",2,5,10,13 May 2017
Kong: Skull Island," Please stop making Kong movies
","I guess if you're a 12yr old gamer and you don't mind a movie full of CGI, you can tolerate these movies. Otherwise, it's 2hrs of your life you'll never get back. The plot is tired and the acting is cringe-worthy - probably because the script is so bad. Every time I flip through the channel guide and see 'King Kong', I check to see if its the one with Jeff Bridges because that's the only one worth watching. The two newer versions are downright shameful, but they know they'll make money so they keep making them anyway.",1,2,5,12 May 2017
