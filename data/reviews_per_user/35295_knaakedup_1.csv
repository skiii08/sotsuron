Hereditary," This is my first review on here
","I just walked out of this movie. Holy crap was that incredible. I can't think of the last time when getting back to the car, then entire group of people wanted to talk about what they just saw before going home. In this day and age when it seems like every movie is based on a superhero or the 'next big thing' horror movie is nothing but a jump scare cash grab - this movie is brilliant. Needed this so bad.
