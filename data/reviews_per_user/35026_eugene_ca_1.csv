3:10 to Yuma," Great Movie
","This movie has all the elements of a great Leonard adaptation. The dialogue is snappy and the pace is perfect for the action you expect from a Western. To the nay sayers (women first) why can't you appreciate something for what it is, for once. You make us men watch your overly wrought chick flicks, god forbid we excuse ourselves to go to the washroom to laugh at the farce we are forced to endure!! For those who do not understand the ending, may you be reminded that Ben Wade tells Dan Evans that he's been in Yuma prison 2x and escaped both times. That's why he summoned his horse at the end....get it!!! He gets a roof over his head and time to heal and the Evans get their reward...win - win duh!!! The acting was also awesome, Ben Foster was great as Charlie Prince and it was good to see Peter Fonda back!!!",9,1,2,13 November 2010
