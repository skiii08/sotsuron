Come and See," A truly outstanding film
","Rarely does a film like this come along. In fact, it puts a whole new dimension in film making. Although the film starts out somewhat slow, the viewer is immersed into the realism of rural life and partisans in Belorussia during WW2. As the film evolves, the viewer experiences to some extent the bleakness created by the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The bleakness suddenly turns to chaos and then a level of brutality only a Hun could be proud of, where all senses of morality and decency are absent. The acting in superb, even down to the facial expressions of the partisans. Rarely do you find such fine acting, even in the West. But of course one must consider most of actors would be well educated in the Nazi occupation of Belorussia and the evil unleashed from the monsters who killed off a third of the population of Belorussia. A sense of anger and even hopelessness is felt watching this intense war film. The film exposes in a very bad light another chapter of German crimes against humanity few in the West have learned of, crimes for which Germany can never repay now or in the future. The camera work is brilliant in the film, where the bleakness is highlighted in dull tones throughout. I would strongly advise children do not watch this film - it is simply too disturbing, to the extent it makes Saving Private Ryan look like a G-rated cartoon show. Even adults with a conscience would have difficulty coming to terms with the brutality of war as shown in this film. I suggest too the viewer researches further the German atrocities in Russia in World War 2.",10,9,11,20 December 2011
Gravity," Technically very flawed, quite boring and silly
","Lousy film. Why? Full of technical faults and silliness. I won't spoil the film, but anyone who knows anything about space and the atmosphere will know this film is rubbish. There were far too many ridiculous scenes in the film. The story was thin. It had full on effects, but was technically weak. I found it boring. It it more suitable for the cheap thrills American market but not suitable for those who want to engage in a deep and meaningful film. I felt I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this garbage. The fact the ignorant clown sitting in the seat next to me at the cinema took the entire film getting on my nerves drinking his slurpee and feeding his fat face with junk food, he did not influence the 2/10 I gave this film. The fact this film has received such a high rating beggars belief. If you want a good film, don't waste your time with this. If you want some cheap thrills then this might be for you - but watch out for any imbeciles sitting in the seats near you.",2,4,11,25 October 2013
District 9," Great film, but with strong apartheid overtones
","I could not help feel this film is a parody about how South African police bigots treated indigenous South Africans under apartheid. The parallels are throughput the film, from start to finish. The actor they chose for the lead cop role portrayed perfectly the arrogance and brutality. The film starts somewhat slow, but one gets a sense all is not what it seems. The film gathers momentum and the action becomes intense. Some may find the accent annoying, but it does add to the realism of the film. The technical effects are excellent. Another minor annoyance was the jerky camera work. I don't know why camera operators overdo this - it was almost as bad as those B-grade American law and order shows a few years which made viewers seasick. All in all it was a good film. It takes a great producer like the Peter Jackson to produce such am entertaining but disturbing film.",8,0,1,3 October 2009
World Trade Center," Great film except for one appalling lie.
","The film was well done, stirred up emotions and the effects were excellent. I was impressed that the film focused on the personal effects and heroism from the WTC disaster. However one big propaganda lie was told that was carefully crafted to fool the average American who believes almost anything dished out to him or her. It was dangerous, stupid and deceitful for the producers to infer that Iraq was involved in the bombings. Iraq had nothing to do with the bombings. It was as if the lies were written by George Dubya himself. I walked out of the film as soon as realised what the script writers had done. Unfortunately, it ruined what would have been a decent and moving film.",5,2,5,7 October 2006
