Kill Bill: Vol. 2," It transcends its genre and becomes Tarantino's most thoughtful and sophisticated work
","In my brief, initial review of 'Kill Bill Vol. 1.' I made the regrettable mistake of dismissing it as exceedingly pleasing yet unsubstantial stylistic masturbation, lacking the profundity and characterizations of Tarantino's previous works. Rarely have I been happier to be proven wrong.What once seemed like somewhat incoherent cinematic recklessness has, after viewing the second part of Mr. Tarantino's saga, revealed itself to be wild, imaginative and brilliant filmmaking. As a whole, 'Kill Bill' is utterly unified (not despite but because of the radical shift in tone), possesses a strong, dramatic ark, and, above all, stands as quite possibly the most passionate, loving tribute to cinema I have ever seen. While part one pays homage to Brian De Palma, Dario Argento and the Shaw Brothers, part two cites, among many others, Jean-Luc Godard, Sergio Leone, and Robert Siodmark.But that's far from all.In his critical essay 'The Cinema of the Cool', Kevin Murphy suggests that Tarantino must move on and grow up to fully realize his potential as a filmmaker. In my opinion, with this piece, he has done so. Those merely seeking the blood-splattered, broken-bone action of Vol. 1 will be severely disappointed by Vol. 2, which is infinitely more thoughtful, pondering the nature of violence, both in cause and effect. While the action in the first installment was great, comic book fun, here it becomes severely unpleasant, cringe inducing, and never without consequence. If anything, it reminded me of the great Akira Kurosawa's work. Remarkable.",Null,51,88,15 April 2004
Casablanca," How could any comment possibly do this justice?
","Still indisputably my favorite movie of all time, there is absolutely nothing I could say that hasn't been said before or that would do Curtiz's masterpiece justice. So I won't. Instead I shall recommend Warner Brother's fantastic new DVD set, which not only includes a beautifully restored version of the film, but also insightful audio commentaries by film historian Rudy Behlmer and critic Roger Ebert. Finally the opportunity to have a trained professional explain to you exactly why this movie rules as much as it does.",10,1,1,9 August 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A pleasant surprise of the highest order
","My expectations for this movie - or its score, for that matter - were not too high. In fact, let's face it: I expected it to suck very, very hard. Fortunately I was pleasantly surprised, nay blown away even. I haven't had this much fun at an action/adventure film since The Mummy. From the astoundingly lush sets and costumes to the beautiful cinematography, to the satisfyingly quotable dialogue, this movie had everything the blusteringly swashbuckling connoisseur could hope for. But what really makes it such a tremendously enjoyable experience is the fantastic acting. Johnny Depp's performance as Jack Sparrow once again proves that he is one of the finest actors of our generation - boastful, swaggering and deliciously over the top he is never boring to watch. Geoffrey Rush is no less excellent as the dreadful undead pirate Captain LeChuck, who kidnaps the beautiful governor's daughter Elaine Marley (Bend it Like Beckham's Keira Knightley) to undo the curse he and his shipmates suffer from. Also great: Orlando Bloom as Elaine's childhood friend Guybrush Threepwood, a dashing (as opposed to merely runny) blacksmith turned pirate. It's all very much The Mummy meets Cutthroat Island, though done with a lot more skill and panache. My second favorite film of the year so far (after Finding Nemo). I can only hope that Wild Wild West II: The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen will turn out to be equally superb.As for the score, Klaus Badelt (and six other composers, amongst them Jimmy Doodle and Steve Jabalabomsky) once again proves that while he may not be a very original composer, he is superb at filtering other people's work. He distilled the best of Gladiator and Muppet Treasure Island, filtered out all of the annoying Lisa Gerrard whining and cheap synthesizers, added a bit of K-19, Drop Zone and Goblin (the cue accompanying the initial appearance of the Black Pearl was quite reminiscent of their wonderful work for Argento's Suspiria) and mixed it all up, resulting in a marvelous little film music stew. It's all the MV nutrients without the fats! I might even get the CD, if only for that fabulously re-orchestrated version of the Drop Zone trailer music!Satisfying? Yes. But since this is one of the finest adventure films I've seen in ages, I still cannot help but lament that Silvestri didn't write this score. Or Goldsmith. Or Shearmur. Or Debney. Or Doyle. It would have kicked Cutthroat Island, The Mummy Returns AND Sinbad into oblivion.",Null,0,0,22 July 2003
The Day After Tomorrow," The Day After Tomorrow - A Dangerous Piece of Environmental Hysteria
","Roland Emmerich's The Day After Tomorrow' presumes that if the ocean convection current that cycles warm water north from the Equator to the North Atlantic, where it cools and gets cycled back down to the Equator, gets `broken', Northern Europe will no longer be receiving warmth transferred from the Equator and will fall into a new Ice Age. This also means that the Equator will heat up, since it won't be receiving cooler water cycled down from the North.This, thankfully, is a big load -- at least as depicted in this film. Don't get me wrong; Global Warming is a very serious issue that requires further research on how it can be more efficiently controlled. I'm not remotely enough of an educated environmentalist to argue the issue vigorously with someone who is, but what little I do know, reinforced with a hefty dollop of gut feeling, strongly suggests to me that it's the right course. Hey, at least I am willing to admit my relative ignorance. Most environmental groups on the other hand are sadly and grossly misinformed about environmental science and, since they also simultaneously carry many other, stupid agendas (like antiglobalization), the last thing they want to do is bring science to the table, simply because it will upset their carefully constructed propagandized house of cards. The environmental movement is simply chocked full of nuts, some of which were undoubtedly behind the disaster that is The Day After Tomorrow.' I fear this film will hurt the cause far more than it will help.This leads to an obvious question: Is Emmerich (who got the chief writing credit here) one of these nuts, or was he simply looking for another cheap excuse to satisfy his New York City destruction fetish? Or did one of his story advisors deliberately feed him misinformation?With most popcorn flicks I might be inclined to just shut up about the science and take the movie on its own terms, as long as it adheres to whatever narrative and physical rules established up front, but this is supposed to be a serious environmental disaster film, a caveat to all us polluters and exploiters of Mother Nature. That the earth is warming up is no longer in doubt. Everyone at this point (even the greenhouse `skeptics' of the 90's) agree that there is a definite warming trend. But the scenario presented by Emmerich is based on theories that have been debunked long ago, depicted so very ludicrously they could almost serve as parody.
Hell, this film does for the environmentalists what The Life of David Gale' did for death penalty abolitionists. Sanctimonious political hooey, all of it. And what rebuttal does the movie present? A pseudo-Dick Cheney babbling about the fragility of the American economy. Oh, and Americans illegally immigrating into Mexico. Ho-ho.This isn't supposed to be Ferngully' after all. THAT's why I'm looking for some logic and an at least rudimentary scientific basis.<ul><li>THAT's why I get angry when Jake Gyllenhaal doesn't loose his hand to frostbite after being outside on the ship with no glove.</li></ul><ul><li>THAT's why I get angry when our protagonists can outrun a freeze during which the temperature drops ten degrees a second. </li></ul><ul><li>THAT's why I get angry when an entire Ice Age comes and goes in four days.</li></ul>
<ul><li>THAT's why I get angry when the cancer kid has to wait for an ambulance even though he's really only on oxygen. </li></ul><ul><li>THAT's why I get angry when it never occurs to anyone in the library to burn the wooden furniture instead of valuable, historically significant books </li></ul><ul><li>THAT's why I get angry when it never occurs to the trekkers that left the library to simply enter another building when the storm gets really bad.</li></ul>Of course I didn't initially consider The Day After Tomorrow' to be some sort of scientifically-based anti-pollution story. I mean, I sure didn't read any Lord of the Rings' reviews that stated `This film is a poorly-veiled commentary on the modern use of magic rings in military operations, damn it to hell.' Having seen The Day After Tomorrow,' though, it does seem true that Emmerich is torn between wanting to save America and wanting to level New York. And that Jack Hall fellow, the one I believe was the hero, with the son, he did have a fairly unsubtle speech to make: `Whether we survive depends on whether human beings can learn from our mistakes. What say you, my son?'Donnie Darko: `I survived, thanks to the books at my local library!'Ok, just as a thought experiment let's assume that this indeed was merely supposed to be a stupid blockbuster and see if it succeeds on that level. For instance, let us compare this film to the ultimate twister epic (because both had tornados in it), a little independent film by the name of Twister, starring that very wooden actor, Will Paxton. Or Bill Patton. No matter. While I never was a big fan of Twister', at least it built tension -- much like a good orgasm -- liberally spreading progressively bigger-getting tornadoes all the way through its taut narrative. The Day After Tomorrow,' however, blows it's wad far too early and then timidly asks the audience to cuddle for the next hour and a half. It's a classic case of premature tornado ejaculation.Now if the tornados had faces like that of the Master Control Program from Tron' and spoke in deep, falsetto voices before devouring L.A., that would be a different story.Hell, at least that volcano in Volcano' was one hell of a huge volcano, if you catch my drift. Also, I like to say `volcano'. Volcano. Sorry, I'll stop now.Volcano.I don't say this often, but screw Emmerich. Screw Emmerich up his sanctimonious, political, German arse. The guy should have stuck with bad Van Damme cyborg movies or German homoerotic low-budget rape/prison dramas of the future. That's what he's good at, people.",Null,7,14,7 June 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," It aims higher and falls lower
","More ambitious than the wretched Phantom Menace, after which I had ridiculously low expectations for Attack of the Clones, it is even more disheartening to see George Lucas' follow-up effort fail so miserably Â– though I can't say I'm surprised. Lucas has taken a fun and energetic franchise and turned it into a witless, soulless, and joyless exercise in wretched excess (of almost Ken Russelian proportions), full of ponderous exposition, atrocious acting and video game-like special effects.I think this is about as close as I've ever come to walking out of any movie in my life, topping bottom-of-the-barrel fare like Adventures of Pluto Nash or The Country Bears. Even Batman and Robin was not capable of inflicting this much pain on its audience. It makes the majority of MST3K's cannon fodder look like Kane in comparison.",1,1,3,10 August 2003
Romeo + Juliet," Shakespeare as Served by Taco Bell
","William Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet' has been performed and adapted countless times, and, unfortunately, most of said adaptations have been utterly unable to arouse more than fleeting interest in our current young generation. Consequently, I have to admit that my anticipation for this new interpretation by Baz Luhrman was restrained and, in fact, even somewhat pessimistic. Still, as an antidote to the banal merriment of the Christmas season, during which the film was initially in release, it serves well.The modern setting, though at first glance somewhat unsettling and irritating, anchors the interpretation of Shakespeare's romantic tragedy in a context familiar to the actors and audience. The acting is unexpectedly robust, considering the fact that a majority of the actors are in fact not (or at least weren't at the time) theatrically trained. One cannot but wonder if passion of such intensity was ever known by any of these plucky teens, these tumbleweeds in the desert of drama. The set and costumes are harmoniously combined and very worthwhile, within the context of a modern rendering. And the set design, too, is immensely resourceful, if not immensely successful. The costumes demonstrate a primal polarity of colors to differentiate the opposing forces as they tear asunder the dramatic passion binding Romeo and Juliet.Indeed, just as the spirit of Johann Sebastian Bach gives life to lifeless digital sound canvas, so can the spirit of Shakespeare illuminate any shadowy modern context. 'Romeo and Juliet' is a treasure that benefits the world of the dramatic arts by transforming the detached audience into emotional participants. Yes, 'Romeo and Juliet', like Taco Bell, appeals to those seeking spicy freshness in a context of rapid deployment!In case you haven't noticed, the above paragraphs contained generous portions of sarcasm. In actuality, this adaptation is a dull, botched one, a far cry from say Franco Zeffirelli's stunningly erotic version.Updating the plays of Shakespeare has obviously occupied the minds of many directors before, but it is a good idea to try to occupy the minds of the audience as well. After all, while this is not the Bard's best play, it unarguably contains his best poetry; that is because the play is also about language, about the difference between what something is and the language used to describe it. Hence, this may be one of the hardest Shakespearean plays to adapt to a modern setting. In part this may be due to the dramatic asides, which broadcast private remarks for all to hear, except the target of the remark, but even more importantly the play suffers from another blessing, which is also a curse: the enormous power of the story itself. Any failure to do it justice is likely to be perceived as monumental. Such is the fate of Luhrmans's film, a poppy and incoherent music video mess. The cast's endeavors to render the Bard's language more relaxed and informal are disastrous, as are the countless Mexican standoffs and gunfights that replace the swordfights of the original play. Danes and DiCaprio are utterly lost here, as is any semblance of sense or continuity. Rather than immersing the audience, the MTV style quickly becomes dull and extremely distracting. Ah, but tell that to the teenyboppers, to whom this thing is basically critic proof! To attempt it is to carelessly stroll into a hedonist orgy in Birkenstock sandals, step on every single bare foot, imbibe all half-finished glasses of Maraschino liqueur, smoke a La Gloria Cubana and engage people in tête-à-tête concerning the European Monetary Union - very silly. They'll just look at you all googly-eyed and inform you that `Leo is sooooooooo hot!'Bah!",Null,1,1,15 April 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," A bag of hot air after all
","In my review of The Matrix: Reloaded' I declared that it would be impossible to precisely rate it without first examining its resolution. Finally, with The Matrix: Revolutions,' that resolution has arrived, but unfortunately it turns out to be even less satisfying than what I could have possibly predicted in my most depressing nightmares. To call the Wachowskis' spiritualizing a bag of hot air would be anunderstatement of almost biblical proportions, as the ending most resemblesTron' run through a pretentious Anime filter (don't get me wrong, Tron' is a very fine film and infinitely superior to this dreck). Add to that a barrage of bad sci-fi clichés (even worse than the Asimov and Bradbury `inspired' SecondRenaissance Part 1 & 2'), hackneyed lines that will make you squirm in agony, headache-inducing action scenes, and characters one wants to die a mostpainful death, and you get a concoction fit only for the most fanatic Matrix' fan, devoid of even the most subtle smidgeon of taste.All of this wouldn't be so bad if the Wachowskis hadn't presented it in such a ponderous and padded manner. Let's face it: There is absolutely no goodreason to split this material into two films  it could have been easily told in two and a half hours (at the most). If brevity is the essence of wit, the Wachowskis are the most humorless filmmakers since Rainer Werner Fassbinder (don't getme wrong, his 15 1/2 hour epic Berlin Alexanderplatz'  still seems much shorter than what they delivered here). For the love of all that is good and decent: Stop!",1,5,8,7 November 2003
Van Helsing," What the Helsing?
","Alan Silvestri has graced us with innumerable sublime scores, from the heroic, fanfare-heavy `Back to the Future' to the strikingly simple `Forest Gump' to the sprightly, jovial `Mousehunt' to the propulsive, percussion-driven powerhouse `Predator.' His work ranges from the divinely subtle to the outlandishly epic, but rarely is it ever intrusive or over the top. Consequently, when he feels the need to violently pummel me with snare drums, I instantly know something is wrong. Well, of course Silvestri's score for `Van Helsing' is obnoxiously loud - it has to compete with piercing vampire screams, earsplitting thunder, and enough creaks, crashes and explosions to destroy any surround system. I can only suppose director Steven Sommers (`The Mummy,' `The Mummy Returns,' `The Mummy Forever,' `The Mummy and Robin' and, of course `Abbot and Costello Meet The Scorpion King') figured this would be the only way to keep his audience awake. Hell, Van Helsing's (Hugh Jackman) heroic theme even blasts at full force while he is leisurely strolling to Paris while adjusting his hat.No matter. After finishing his assignment in Paris (featuring a brief cameo by Mr. Hulk, of `Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hulk' fame), Van Helsing returns to the Vatican to have a long chat with the Italian Basil Exposition, Cardinal Esposizione Del Basilico (Alun Armstrong, overacting with zeal). As Van Helsing apparently suffers from both short- and long-term memory loss, Basilico spends most of his time reiterating their shared past, then assigns him to travel to Transylvania in order to guard princess Anna Valerious (anorexic Kate Beckinsale, dressed in a mildly fetishistic leather and cotton outfit), the last surviving member of her ancient, vampire-hunting family. Turns out one of her ancestors stupidly promised God that he and his unfortunate relations would neither rest nor enter heaven until Dracula was defeated. 'In retrospect, an obvious mistake,' Basilico quips. Thus Helsing now must make sure that the poor dope's family won't be lost in purgatory.Friar Carl, played by David Wenham of `SeaChange' fame, aids Van Helsing in this debatable quest by supplying him with daylight grenades directly out of Guillermo Del Toro's `Blade 2,' spinning razors, silver bullets, holy water and a rapid-fire crossbow with a seemingly endless supply of ammunition. (Now, it should be pointed out that nowhere in Bram Stoker's classic novel -- or its many cinematic adaptations -- does Van Helsing use anything even remotely like this crossbow, but it has long been hypothesized by reputable literary scholars that he was in fact modeled after an oddball historical personage by the name of Wilberforce H.K. Smithington who may have used something like it.) Before I forget, judging from his affected British accent Wenham is under the regrettable delusion that he is providing voice-over for Pino Van Lamsweerde's `Asterix in Britain.' 'It was a real doddle copping down here to Transylvania, what what? Just smashing,' one can almost hear him say.Still, in terms of sheer ludicrousness none of the above can even compare to Count Vladislaus Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) and his brides (three obnoxious Maxim models). Roxburgh's performance is obviously modeled after both the Count from `Sesame Street' and an Ed Wood-era Bela Lugosi. 'Beware,' Dracula warns. 'Beware of the big green dragon that sits on your doorstep. He eats little boys... puppy dog tails, big fat snails. Beware. take care.' Later, he demonstrates how a vampire eats a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. 'I like to eat the peanut butter first,' he exclaims, leaving deep tooth marks in the drained chocolate cup. Meanwhile his wives unanimously pretend to be in a Joel Schumacher film. When they're not gesticulating wildly or turning into androgynous, Marilyn Manson-like flying Barbie dolls, they boast even worse accents than Dracula, taunting and playing with Valerious in what `Ebert's Bigger Little Movie Glossary' refers to as the 'Fallacy of the Talking Killer.' Helsing and Valerious might as well have fought three Jar Jar Binkses instead. 'Your blahd vill keep me beautiful forever,' Bride #3 sneers. 'Vat do you zink about zat?' Valerious replies: 'If you're going to kill someone, do it. Don't just stand there talking about it.' Apparently, she's a fan of `The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', where Tuto utters the similar, famous line 'When you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk.' Or perhaps director Steven Sommers was a little too aware of the fact that the brides could have easily killed Valerious 20 minutes into the film, but instead opted to merely lick her face, ala `The Relic.'Ah, but the many `homages' don't end there. Besides the aforementioned films, Sommers pilfers scenes from `Return of the Jedi' (Luke burning Vader's remains and the following metaphysical appearance of Anakin, Obi Wan and Yoda), `Raiders of the Lost Ark' (the desert chase, where Indy's private parts come dangerously close to the wheels of the truck), `Speed' (the bus jumping the bridge), `The Lion King' (Simba's father in the sky), `Twister' (a cow being tossed around for comic effect), `The Hunchback of Notre Dame' (`The bells, the bells!') and of course the Bond franchise (Q, a rip-off so obvious that it has been pointed out by every single reviewer on the web). Also, he recycles plot devices from his own films, such as the illustration explaining how to kill the monster, a device used in `The Mummy Returns,' and Kevin J. O'Connor's performance as Igor, identical to Joey `Tooch' Pantucci from `Deep Rising' and Beni Gabor from the first `Mummy.'
Oh, and of course there's the rope swinging, reminiscent of both `Tarzan' and `Spider-Man.' Never in my life have I seen this much rope swinging in utter defiance of all known physics. Almost every major character, even (I am not making this up!) the Frankenstein monster, gets to swing hundreds of feet across canyons and ravines, smashing safely through windows or against walls without ever suffering any visible harm -- 'Pull the strings,' Dracula yells. 'Pull the strings!' At one time Valerious falls hundreds of feet, smashes against several ropes on the way, gets electrocuted, and is still able to catch the edge of a bridge, holding on with one hand. This makes me wonder why she hasn't considered simply strapping on an ACME jet backpack instead? And why, I must ask, didn't Friar Carl supply Van Helsing with an oversized magnet?Incidentally, does anyone remember those mildly amusing yogurt commercials from the early '90s where people would eat a 'heavy' sandwich and consequently fall through the floor? The exact same thing happens to Van Helsing and Velerious here, except that the sandwich has been replaced by absinthe. Yup, there's nothing funnier than people falling through shoddy floors! Of course, the floor doesn't even mess up our heroes' hair. This makes me wonder. is Van Helsing immortal? Or is he just ageless? Sommers seems to hint at the fact that Helsing is in fact archangel Gabriel, the left hand of God, and was present at the battle of Masada. What the hell is that all about? And why does Dracula keep werewolves around if they're the only ones who can kill him? And. vampire baby bats? ('One, one bat! Two, two bats! Hahahah!') And what the hell are those mole-men working in Dracula's laboratory? And why does the coach catch on fire when struck by a wolfman? And why does Dracula dress like a Flamenco instructor? And won't Frankenstein starve to death, stranded at sea on that ridiculous raft? And . oh, never-frickin'-mind!I'm not even going to get started on the abysmal special effects on display here. Let's just say they're not nearly as convincing as Bert I. Gordon's bendable clay puppets.Blech.",Null,0,1,9 May 2004
Pearl Harbor," Thank you, Michael Bay, for making us laugh about love... again!
","John Hartnett and Ben Affleck star as dashing (as opposed to merely 'runny') pilots in love with the same woman, a for the time surprisingly anorexic model type played by Kate Beckinsale. This love triangle gets so convoluted and unbelievable throughout the film that one almost expects Hartnett and Affleck to end up together, or possibly even a sexy soft-core three-way (Beckinsale: 'Oh... I just can't decide between the two of you, so I'll have you BOTH!').Equally hilarious is the complete lack of historical accuracy, from the Germans bombing DOWNTOWN London (and where would this be, pray tell?), to the fact that Hawaii is populated by nothing but rich Caucasians, dressing their kids as angels and chasing them down hills in slow motion. Also of course absolutely nobody smokes, despite the fact that this is the frickin' '40s. Not to mention the physically impossible flying scenes during Bays action scenes, apparently an intended homage to Star Wars - or so they would be if Bay's direction didn't immediately disintegrate into a rampageous helter-skelter mess of atrocious takes, clumsy acting, irritatingly gut-wrenching hand-held camera wiggling, and music-video editing.The movie's politically correct portrayal of the Japanese should also not be missed, planning their attack with toy boats in a little pool while lamenting the unfortunate fact that they have to attack the United States. 'A brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war', Yamamoto says, 'but they have given us no choice. Due to some economical reason or other, possibly to do with trade routes or something, we must attack the U.S., even though we really don't want to. In fact, we love America and are really, really sorry for having to attack it. Please accept my most sincere apologies for this heinous act. [*starts sobbing*] Oh, why? WHY must we do this?

28 Days Later...," 28 Days Later: Silent Earth of the Living Omega Dogs
","During the first half hour of '28 Days Later' I was ecstatic. This, I thought, was precisely the way the 'Resident Evil' movie SHOULD have been done. So engrossed was I in it's faux-low-budget style, I didn't even mind that it was just about literally another filmed version of Matheson's 'I Am Legend' (previously adapted as 'The Omega Man') crossed with Craig Harrison's 'The Quiet Earth' (later adapted by Geoff Murphy under the same title). But then I started to get restless, noticing more and more James Horneresqe direct rips from 'Dawn of the Dead', 'Night of the Living Dead' and even the substandard 'Day of the Dead'. Yes, I slowly realized that this movie didn't contain a single, original thought. Add to this the incredibly senseless idiocy of the film's hero Jim, who repeatedly gets himself in inanely deadly situations only to escape through sheer dumb luck, and you get a stupendously infuriating movie.Then there's the film's visual style. Though Boyle does allow the digital fluff to somewhat defile his otherwise impressively potent post-apocalyptic setting, some of the early zombie scenes were indeed undeniably effective. Unfortunately, though, he nauseatingly overuses that Saving Private Ryan shutter-strobe effect to cover the disappointing lack of actual gore scenes. He prevents us from getting a good look at anything, not unlike Paul Anderson did in his disastrous 'Resident Evil'.In it's second half, the film suddenly turns into Peckinpah's 'Straw Dogs', with Jim in the Dustin Hoffman role, defending his girlfriend Selena from sex-starved British soldiers, who surprisingly turn out the be the real villains of the film (incidentally, this also closely resembles Romero's underrated 'The Crazies'). Now, despite the fact that Jim was earlier established as a complete and utter imbecile, he is somehow able to perfectly predict and control the behavior of the surviving zombies, which he uses as preposterous weapons against the soldiers. I kid you not! In the film's third half, we're actually supposed to be rooting for the zombies as they violently slaughter soldier after soldier, including uninvolved innocents who just happened to be serving with the three rapists. The ending is so eerily similar to 'Straw Dogs' that I couldn't help being revolted (not by the violence, but by the plagarism and its implications, considering Peckinpah's original intentions). Plus, the British soldiers are complete idiots, actually deciding to leave the safe perimeter of their base and enter the woods JUST TO KILL JIM! Couldn't they have just shot him in a remote part of the base and added his body to the already existing pile of zombies? But that wouldn't have given him the chance to escape, would it?Blech.",Null,0,0,19 August 2003

The Matrix Reloaded," This is hard to review...
","Alright. so. The Matrix Reloaded. hmmmm. where to begin?
My feelings are extremely mixed, but trying to in any way review this movie borders on the impossible due to its serial nature - about half a dozen plot lines are set up without any further payoff. Though I am dumbfounded by its lengthy scenes of Bert I. Godonesque exposition (back when film makers didn't worry about having to hold an audience) and goofy Anime-like plot, if I was to criticize them now I might have to seriously eat my words in November. Even so, it perhaps suffices to say that this is one of these annoying examples of a sequel that completely changes the rules and meaning of its predecessor (much like 2010: The Year We Made Contact retroactively altered 2001: A Space Odyssey). The Wachowski brothers seem alternately like geniuses and madmen - at times it almost appears like they are trying to pad out their film with endless scenes only vaguely connected with the main plot (such as the one involving Monica Belluci as Persephore) or with completely unnecessary rave scenes that, much like the intermediate sections of Pod People, just never end (to quote Crow T. Robot: `We paid for the song, so we're going to use all of it!'). Agent Smith apparently doesn't serve any real purpose, except to show up at inconvenient times and be beaten up by Neo. Then again, perhaps we will later learn how he is connected with the two manipulative main forces pulling the strings in the Matrix, which I shall not give away here (the revelation of one came as a considerable shock to me). On the other hand, there are isolated scenes of pure brilliance (such as the final piece of plot exposition) in this plucky piece that are worthy of Clark and Heinlein. The action scenes border between the gratuitous and unconvincing, such as Neo's first encounter with the Smiths (the CGI Neo seen frequently here is uncomfortably reminiscent of Blade II) and the mind-blowing 20+ minute highway chase. Still, the overload of action scenes is somewhat repetitious and made me feel like someone jammed my head into the cushions of a Sharper Image Massage chair and hit the Shiatsu setting.So was I entertained? Yes. Was I bored? Frequently. Was I amazed? Constantly. Did I like the film? I have not the slightest idea. I'll tell you in November.",3,0,0,22 July 2003
X2: X-Men United," An improvement, but still lacking focus
","Let me first of all say that I have never been a comic book fan, and the ones I have read (with the possible exception of Alan Moore's work) I usually found either mind-numbingly dull, idiotic or both, so I was probably not the intended audience for this film. In fact, the first X-Men movie remains my only introduction to these highly popular characters and boy was I confused when watching this next installment. Waaaaay too many characters and sub plots, in my opinion. As far as I could tell this movie involved nothing but a group of strange Jungian figures in silly costumes beating the stuffing out of each other. If I want to see that sort of thing I might just as well watch any of the old Steeve Reeves Hercules films.What a shame considering the `deep underlying themes' my comic book friends claim this movie explores. But let's face it, it doesn't. Whatever underlying themes this movie had, they were mercilessly crushed by an endless barrage of special effects and Ed Woodian lines like `You are a God among insects', though admittedly well delivered by the great Ian McKellen, this film's saving grace.While it might alienate the die hard fans, Singer seriously needs to eliminate characters and sub-plots to narrow the focus of this franchise.",Null,0,0,10 August 2003
