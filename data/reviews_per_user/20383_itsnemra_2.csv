Your Name.," I am speechless.
","So the movie is named 'Your name?' and its a perfect title, it doesn't reveal anything about the content and yet it caught my interest. I tend to watch animated movies because they have so much more to offer at the same time it is a tougher competition.The story line is really good, why? Well it you are open minded it will be pretty easy to follow and accept what is going on, question about how and why get answered by themselves if you believe it is possible. Regarding the animation it give you what your mainstream point of view of Japans architecture, nature, culture and society, all from how they dress to the body language etc. The music, sound effects and voice actor/actress amplifies the emotions and guides you from start till end. There are plenty of a messages and it makes me thing about me and everything living around me, where I come from and where I am going. Regarding the character development its spot on, no more information was needed then what was provided, we are limited but at the same time free to make our own thought.I wish to say thank you to everyone who have supported and/or worked with this piece of art, they should feel really proud of themselves, it is an honor that you shared it with us (the viewers). Thank you!",10,209,297,9 September 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Star Wars: Episode IX A Space Fiasco
","Every coin has two sides and this movie really lives up to that statement.
The acters and actresses are probably doing a really good job based on what the producers asked from them but was it a true Star Wars act, sadly not, it wasn't much of a story line explained by the characters as the original Episode IV, V and VI, lots of forced jokes and attempt to be funny in a none Sci-Fi matter.What about the art, design of the adventure?
Once again it is what the producer asked for, heavy details but not much appreciation was given to it, I feel sad for all those hours of work put into it with good guidelines and yet no sorry.As Disney have proven in all their contributions a lack of basic understanding both in Stsr Wars Universe but also Sci fi as a genre which is really disappointing.First of all the time travelling between teo locations are instant?
Insane scaling of mass production both the good and evil?
The fact Leia was dead but not asscended as an astral projection for days as a 'Jedi'?
C-3P0 having humor?
Quicksand not being visible before thry got trapped and than being totally visible rest of the movie?
Since Ren is a sith, were both or one of her parents a sith/jedi?
This wierd bond between dyads?
Yellow lightsaber designed to have two activation points?
The new eradicate weapon?
The wierd explosion of Hijines?
Both Jedis aiming for killing blows on everything they fight?The list goes on and on for 141 minutes.",4,2,3,19 December 2019
