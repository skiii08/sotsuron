Saturday Night Fever," To the night fever
","One of the catalyzers of the disco fever, this film is much more than a flick, as some critics insist. It definitely has become a classic, the best view of the Seventies and one of my all time favorite movies. (I've seen it a thousand times!) Tony Manero, a young Brooklyn guy (played extraordinarily by John Travolta) struggles to be the disco king at a local disco where he's already recognized as a dance master. He also meets Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney) there, a beautiful and snob woman who despises him until she realizes how pretentious she was being. Even though, she's not in love with Manero but became his friend. Parallel plots develop around Manero's family and friends during the film. Director John Badham adds an erotic touch to all dance sequences while Travolta (wearing his classic black and white sport suit) reigns as the greatest find of the film. The great soundtrack by the Bee Gees (which was a smash hit worldwide) remains one of the most popular movie albums of all time.Taking a nostalgic look at the film's costumes is a funny (!) experience too. Wanna know where to go when the record is over? Go get this video to watch the film!",10,0,1,16 March 1999
54," Dancing on life's dance floor
","I found this film really good despite its rather 'wafer-thin' plot. It's almost a documentary about the legendary disco Studio 54 (and the end of the 70's). The characters seem to have something in common: they all wanna win in life, they want to become something important, and that's what I most liked about '54'. The will to grow, to become big, the necessity to be a big shot; it hasn't changed. Everybody wants to be (a big) part of the party, and we know life is the greatest party. Shane, Julie, Anita, Gregg, they all wanted to create their respective 'real' lives as they created inside the glamourous 54, where everybody could be a star. I see it as a metaphor about the race of life, our desire to be important or at least to do something important. If I'm saying too much bullshit, just think the film is still enjoying. It describes just perfectly how was the aura that surrounded Studio 54 and its guests plus that 'late 70's feeling'. The cast and the soundtrack are also great. I found the whole thing a little bit sad although disco music is spread all over the film.",Null,0,0,6 November 1999
Annie Hall," La-di-da, la-di-da, la la...
","One of the best Allen's movies ever, maybe THE best. Everything just works so fine. A MUST SEE.",10,1,3,18 April 1999
Carrie," Loathe among the stars
","No doubt 'Carrie' is the best horror movie ever - a masterpiece - and one of my all time favorite too, of course! Carrie's sad (and tragic) story is told by Brian De Palma with such brilliance and care that even if you hate horror movies, you'll adore this one. It has not that 'second-rate' treatment of the normal movies of this genre. De Palma is an assumed Hitchcock follower. Sissy Spacek is REALLY outstanding as Carrie, she depicts her role breathtakingly through the whole film and Piper Laurie (playing Carrie's mother) is no less worth mentioning too. Both were Oscar Nominees in 1976 (Spacek as Best Actress and Laurie as Best Supporting Actress) but they didn't win. What really matters is that never had a horror movie got such achievement. The rest of the cast is also excellent (many of them became stars after this film) and keeps spectators unmovable until the final sequence. Simply terrific.",Null,0,0,24 March 1999
