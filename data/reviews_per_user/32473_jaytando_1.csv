Blade Runner 2049," Blade Runner 2049: LOVED it!!
","The original 'Bladerunner' (from 1982) is my favorite movie to watch of all time. I snuck into it in the Kirkland, WA theater to see it (I was 12 and it was Rated R) several times and eventually recorded it to VHS from Showtime a few years later and I still have that tape somewhere. Then I bought the Special Edition/Final Cut DVD's (2007). I lost count of how many times I watched it. Gotta be in the hundreds. I just saw the sequel 'Blade Runner 2049' and it is instantly a very close 2nd place all time. They did it RIGHT. I wanted to hate Ryan Gosling in it because he got the part I have always wanted to play since 1982. But gawdammit he was awesome. He killed in it. The whole cast was amazing, The cinematography is mind-blowing. The story worked. It had all of the right nods to the original. The cameos were jaw-dropping. I won't spoil it but when I saw it I was shocked. I will see this film again and again and again and again and again - just like the original.",10,1,10,6 October 2017
