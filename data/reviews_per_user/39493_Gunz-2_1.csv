Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Critics be damned!
","Critics be damned!  This was a great action/adventure/Sci-Fi flick.  It was reminiscent of the first Star Wars, and lived up to my own personal expectations of the movie.  It also setup the rest of the prequel well. Forget the hype, forget the hype that the hype got... when choosing a fun summer movie, this should be at the top of everyone's list.  Like it or not, Star Wars is back!  And three years from now we'll be doing the same thing all over again!",8,0,0,22 May 1999
