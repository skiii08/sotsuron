Hereditary," Surprisingly Good
","The cast is awesome and Toni Collette really delivered in this movie. I'm a horror movie fan and I wouldn't exactly call this horror, but it's for sure a good flick. The entire time you weren't sure where the movie was going - and then the end I was like what the heck just happened - but I gave it a good review because it gave me a few good jump scares and just kept me in suspense the entire time. Honestly the acting and musical is what really kept this movie on my good list.",8,1,2,5 February 2019
Room," OMG so good but sad
",This is really a good film. It's also painful to watch - especially in today's world where children are abducted. I felt so sad and hurt at the end of it but still it was so good.,10,1,4,5 February 2019
The Disaster Artist," Pretty Good
",The movie is crazy - but the acting is good and the fact it's based on a true story is what really does it. You end up thinking how could this be real! So for that reason I gave it a 7,7,0,0,5 February 2019
