It," one of the most well done horror films I've seen in a long while
","'IT' is a Horror, coming-of-age film directed by Andy Muschietti, and stars Bill Skarsgard, Jaden Lieberher, Wyatt Oleff, Jeremy Ray Taylor, Sophia Lillis, Finn Wolfhard, Jack Dylan Grazer, Chosen Jacobs, Nicholas Hamilton, and Jackson Robert Scott. It's about a group of children living in Derry, Maine who are constantly terrorized by a creature in the form of a clown named Pennywise. in order to end this terror, they decide to confront pennywise in the sewers, whilst dealing with bullies and their own personal demons in the process.I'll start by saying that I've never read a book from Stephen King in my life. since I'm fifteen now, beforehand I've only learned of his stories through the movies adapted from his books. I've learned of the best movies adapted and the worst ones adapted from his stories. seeing as how this is another adaptation of the book of the same name, with the last adaptation was in 1990 in the form of a TV miniseries which is seen now as more of a joke than an actual film to be scared of. does this new version of Stephen King's famous novel fare better than the miniseries? or is it just as much of a joke? I'll be happy to say that this movie exceeds on every expectation I had for this movie and it is even better when you think about it often enough to see it again. however a review is still a review and I must give pros and cons no matter how much I love this film. so what do I like about it?<ul><li>first off: Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise is Friggin Fantastic. this could be his best role to date. every scene works whenever he's on screen and it always pays off. not a single dull moment with this performance as well as this character and you know what- I'm actually scared to see him sitting in the corner of my bedroom before I head off to sleep fully knowing all this is fictional. if a character sticks in your head like that after seeing a movie because of the performance, you know It works. </li></ul><ul><li>the child actors are especially amazing. watching them, you actually do get the feeling of their friendship within the losers club or the insanity sweeping over the scenes with Henry Bowers. much like Bill Skarsgard, there's never a dull moment with these actors and their performances and everyone in the losers club gets a moment of heroism in saving each other from the dangers they face and every emotion just works. </li></ul><ul><li>the scares while not scary (and we'll go back to that later) are still frightening and creepy. from the first scene where we meet pennywise, to any scenes with him in it, to any scenes with the bullies, to any scenes taking place in the sewers. it's creepy and it always pays off, while not in the way that you'd think it'll work. </li></ul><ul><li>The cinematography is beautiful and completely makes you feel uncomfortable in certain scenes, and more intrigued in others. </li></ul><ul><li>The music from Benjamin Wallfisch also adds to the uneasiness and intrigue of the movie and it works in every level. I still hop onto youtube just to listen to some of the tracks. </li></ul>What don't I like about this movie? <ul><li>well, I guess the only gripe I have with the movie is that While it is creepy and some scares work well enough to traumatize viewers, the film is never like so scary you just can't take it. a lot of the scares are very easy to handle if you're a lot older to see a movie like this like if your above 13 or 14 (cause obviously anyone underneath the age of 10 cannot handle movies like this unless they got the heart of a lion). movie isn't scary-scary but it still works as a tense filled movie and the fears driven within it work to it's advantage. </li></ul>So overall, The movie is AMAZING. I encourage you to go see it. even if your not a fan of horror, you'll walk out of the theater very happy you saw a great horror movie such as this one like I did. if not, well film is subjective cause everyone has a different opinion and I understand if you think differently. go watch it and see what you think but trust me you won't be disappointed you saw IT.",10,3,5,20 September 2017
Zootopia," One of Disney's best and flawless animated films
","'Zootopia' is Disney's 55th full length animated feature. it is directed by Rich Moore, and Byron Howard. it stars Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman as a bunny named Judy Hopps, and a fast talking scam artist fox named Nick Wilde. the film takes place in an animated world where predator and prey live together in peace and harmony in a city known as Zootopia. Judy Hopps (played by Ginnifer Goodwin) is the first bunny officer in the Zootopia police department or ZPD. when an otter goes missing she has to team up with a fast talking scam artist fox named Nick Wilde (played by Jason Bateman) who is a key witness to the crime, in order to solve the case.I'm gonna tell you right off the bat that this movie is Flawless. it is an amazing movie with great characters, a great story, great writing, great jokes, and great animation. it even has lessons about prejudice, racism, and the judgment of other people based on what they are or what they look like. it covers every problem facing our world today and the way the filmmakers did it is perfect, but I'll talk more about that later.The characters are amazing and the way they work off each other is amazingly well done. Judy Hopps is a great female character, as well as Nick Wilde who is a great male character and the way they work off each other is fantastic. Their back stories very well tie in with their character and how they operate in this world from the past to the present. the other side characters are great and have a purpose to be in the story. there is a villain reveal in this movie, and I am not telling you who the villain is because that would be a spoiler but he/she is a great villain with a great diabolical plan. The story is very original and to recall, I don't think Disney has ever done a story relating to prejudice and racism before in their animated features, which is a tough subject to successfully pull off, and they did it very well here. it touched on every subject to seriously talk about that's happening to this world.The Animation is very well detailed, rendered, and animated and the designs don't feel out of place in the world that they live in. it's amazing to watch and beautiful to look at and easy to identify characters with their design. The soundtrack is very well composed as it is written by Michael Giacchino who composed other Disney works like the incredibles and ratatouille. to end off on a high note this movie is one of Disney's perfect animated films that succeeds in every level of creativity. 10/10-5 stars out of 5 Disney's best animated film.",10,6,18,6 March 2016
Glory," the greatest civil war movie ever made
","'GLORY' is a war film directed by Edward Zwick and stars Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, and Andre Braugher. it tells the story of the 54th soldier regiment consisting of only black men who sign up in an all white soldier regiment to fight for their freedom. this movie is not only a good war film, it is a great film, period. allow me to elaborate on that:the performances: Matthew Broderick as Robert Gould Shaw is one of his best performances in a feature film, where in most movies that I have seen him in, he was bland and uninteresting. Denzel Washington as private Trip was a great performance showing how tough he is to the whites but caring and passionate towards the freedom of blacks which gave him a well earned Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, Morgan Freeman was excellent in the movie, given that he can do no wrong, it clearly shows here. since this was his major film debut, Andre Braugher was great not only as a soldier fighting for freedom, but as a friend towards his companions and his general.the story: this is a moving piece of art that not only captures the spirit of freedom from segregation, but the hardships these men had to endure before they could gain the respect that they deserved. it is a tall tale about sacrifice and the goodwill towards men that not only gives this film an action edge, but an emotional one as well, making it a great historical story that remains accurate the source material that it took place in. The action: it is epic. it not only captures the brutality of war, but the coldness of it and how sad war can end up being. but when the action kicks in, it kicks into full gear giving us some spectacular moments that do kick plenty of butt. with the brilliant acting and the spectacular camera work and sound editing/mixing, it not only gives the film an epic edge but a highly accurate edge as well. final verdict: I was shown this in my history class and thought nothing of it at first. but as I watched it, I not only realized how engaging, epic, and moving that this film was, but how it also managed to sneak it's way onto my top 10 most favorite films ever.",10,1,2,7 June 2016

Despite his age, Andy has never had sex, so his friends, including the laid-back David (Paul Rudd), push Andy towards losing his virginity. While attempting to get over his awkwardness around female customers, Andy meets local shop owner Trish (Catherine Keener), and they begin a tentative romance. this is a very funny movie that i haven't laughed so hard at in a long time. right off the bat it has a good character development. everyone has a backstory that you can see or can't see, and it all concludes with a happy ending for each of them. what's great about this film is Steve carell, the supporting cast, the humor, and the writing. it all blends together to create a funny and sometimes heartwarming film about having whoopee cushion. it has great timing and solid comedic performances from the likes of Paul rudd, and Seth rogen just to name a few. you laugh with Steve carell and you yell at the screen saying, 'don't do this' or 'don't do that!' the love triangle is very believable and very real. it is there and it isn't forced at all. Catherine keener and Steve carell have great chemistry and it never outstays it's welcome. it's sweet and very romantic. you really get the feeling that they're in love, and it's a great romance.what this movie does well is that it's aware that it's a comedy and it takes that advantage and makes a said comedy with it. watch it. you'll have a fun time with this movie if you're single, or on a date night.",9,0,1,6 April 2016
Captain America: Civil War," The the best superhero movie that is the most mature out of all the marvel films
","'Captain America: Civil War' is an action/adventure movie directed by the Russo brothers and stars Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Tom Holland, and Paul Rudd. The Story centers the Avengers whose worlds are turned upside down when a Political interference in the Avengers' activities causes a rift between former allies Captain America and Iron Man. This Movie is not only the best Marvel movie ever, but it is also the best Superhero movie ever made. It's very thought-provoking, emotional, action-packed, and very Mature. right off the bat you get the impression that this movie is going to be a very serious film with dark images, and very shocking scenes in terms of an emotional drama. this movie throws an argument in the story that is very relevant to the plot and crucial to not only this movie but to past marvel films as well. it isn't very one sided and you do see both sides of the argument coming from both Captain America and Iron Man. that is only a piece to the brilliant movie that has a very realistic and gritty tone.Visually it's spectacular. the CGI does very well at blending two things together and making the fight scenes more believable. Speaking of fight scenes, The action segments in the movie are amazing to look at especially the airport fight scene which is filled with moments of awesomeness. The characters are very well developed here just as they were in the comics. Two characters that steal the entire show are Black Panther and Spider-Man. Black panther (played by Chadwick Boseman) does a very great job at playing a character that feels like he lost everything and is looking for vengeance. he did a great job and will probably get awarded someday for such a talent. the real winner is Tom Holland as The Amazing Spider-Man. He shines in this role and not only brings something new to the character but he brings plenty of old and nostalgic parts to his character as well, such as the costume. the actor did a great job at portraying a teen which is what Peter Parker is supposed to be. The rest of the Avengers all have a moment to shine especially Scarlett Witch (who is much better developed here than in Avengers: Age of Ultron). Iron Man and Captain America are very well developed and directed when the emotional moments kick into high- gear. The villain, while very relate-able is pretty forgettable.Overall this movie is amazing and is very incredible. I highly recommend it if you want to watch a great film. Watch it.",9,8,17,7 May 2016
Inside Out," a new Pixar classic
","This a great movie, probably one of the best that I have seen from Pixar studios. the story: a girl named Riley is uprooted from her old home and has moved into San Francisco. her emotions: joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust are the emotions that try to help her get through her new life in the big city. but one day when joy and sadness go missing, it's up to anger, fear, and disgust to keep things in control while joy and sadness try to find a way back to the center of Riley's mind.this movie is not only the most funniest film from Pixar but also the most inventive and imaginative. you watch the movie and you just say to yourself 'genius.' let me talk about the story first. the story is just creative in the best way possible. it keeps heading down a road where the twist and turns that you make are the right ways to get to your destination. it tries to be inventive and funny and it succeeds on every level. the characters are not one dimensional as you would expect. sometimes the emotions have emotions like joy can be sadness or sadness can be joy. the voice acting is great. I simply adore Amy poler as the voice of joy. Richard king is in this movie and he plays Riley's imaginary friend named Bing bong, who is made entirely of cotton candy but also is part cat and part dolphin and Richard king does a great job as the character. the other emotions are great too with similar superior casting such as bill Hadar playing fear, Mindy Kalina playing disgust Lewis black playing anger, and Phyllis smith playing sadness. the animation is amazing. the way the characters move, talk, and act are some of the most expressive I have ever seen.Though that this may be a kids film, it's also a deep movie, having themes such as: running away, crying at school, growing up, lying, losing friends, etc. one scene, as well as a few others, almost made me cry. props to the creators for achieving such a high point.so on a whole, this movie is awesome. the characters, the story, the animation, the themes, the parts that make you cry are all done well. if Pixar's next movie 'the good dinosaur' then there may be some competition at the 2016 Academy Awards.",10,7,32,10 July 2015
Big Hero 6," a fun animated, Oscar worthy, film too lovable to be missed!!!
","Big hero 6 is the story of a Boy named Hiro Hamada who lost his brother to a fire and is left with his creation, a huggable healthcare robot named Baymax. when they both discover a villain that stole Hiro's inventions to get revenge, they form a superhero team of robotic nerds, to save the day. so, what do I like about this film? it has a great story, great cast of characters, a great villain, great animation, a great crossbreed of two big cities, and the greatest character ever made by Disney. it also has a good message about getting over loved ones but still holding them dear to your heart. and it has a great twist halfway into the movie.This movie is Oscar worthy. I'm predicting it'll win best Animated feature film at the 87th Academy awards.",10,32,48,24 November 2014
Finding Dory," An extraordinary sequel that manages to be just as good as it's predecessor
","'Finding Dory' is a 2016 animated film directed by Andrew Stanton and stars Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks, Ed O'Neil, Ty Burrell, and Kaitlin Olsen. it's a sequel to 2003's 'Finding Nemo', and it tells the tale of a fish with short term memory named Dory (who was one of the main characters of the first film) as she one day remembers her parents and decides to go find them while bringing marlin and nemo (the main characters of the first film) to help her find them while meeting new memorable characters as well.This movie is a great movie. it shows how much effort can be put into a sequel to a movie that was just simply amazing. all the effort pays off to show us a heartfelt film that manages to capture the humor and beauty of the first. the story is a good story, and while it copies the first film in terms of a journey, the all around theme is very original. while I will not spoil the message I will say it's a serious topic to carry a plot and it works here. the animation soars here and you can see how much PIXAR has stepped up their game with their craft and it shows. everything looks perfect to the character animation from the way the characters move and how the ocean looks in it's best. it's incredible to look at and beyond amazing and it brings out the best of PIXAR's craft. the characters here are just as memorable as they are in the first film. we have dory the main character of the film and she has to be the most developed character in the entire film as we see her backstory in this movie such as how she spoke whale, to where she learned the song, 'just keep swimming'. it's an interesting and sometimes sad look at her disability in the movie, that being she has short term memory loss. we have other characters as well: a septopus named hank who is a grumpy octopus that helps dory try to find her family, a whale shark named Destiny who can't see very well and has trouble swimming, a beluga whale named bailey who can use echolocation to see things from far away, and two sea lions named Fluke and Rudder who sit on a rock and rest away. all these new characters are memorable as they are funny, since they are provided voices from a good cast. they shine here and they make this movie.while it can copy certain elements from the first film it does it in a way that is spectacular and it is a great example of how a sequel can be just as amazing as it's predecessor. it's a great film and people who love the first film should go check it out.",9,3,11,21 July 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," a film that understands the brutality of war
","Hacksaw Ridge is a film directed by Mel Gibson and stars Andrew Garfield, Vince Vaughn, Teresa Palmer, Sam Worthington, and Hugo Weaving. It is about a young soldier named Desmond Doss who is a young man enlisting into the army by saving lives instead of taking them at the battle of Okinawa at Hacksaw Ridge. this film is as passionate about it's characters and it's source material as it does about it's violence. that's how good it is.after you are immediately drawn into the film, it takes you back to when he was little to when he signed up for war. each moment of this film just loves to pull you into the story which makes you feel present in every situation that Doss comes across. it feels real and raw and worthy of praise. this is a film that not only can show how much of an effect that war can have on a human being but, it shows war, blood, death, ad all the violence you in saving private Ryan times a billion. the war in this movie is gritty and you will leave the theater shocked at what you saw. limbs are flying everywhere, guts are exploding from stomachs, blood is everywhere, bodies are left to rot in dirt and ash. you feel as if every time a gun is fired, death comes immediately after. it's incredibly brutal, and effective, and painful to look at. when someone is shot you feel as if they're getting shot at. it's very effective and you will watch every explosion on screen without breathing just like the soldiers did in this movie. it's intense. the characters are characters that you will grow attached to. Andrew Garfield as Desmond Doss pulls off an Oscar Worthy performance as the man that saved 75 lives on that field. every emotion coming from him is real and it's emotional. you want him to make it out alive and you want him to succeed. every time he saves a life, your fists will pump in the air. Vince Vaughn as Sergeant Howell is another Oscar Worthy Performance that shows a ton of humanity into all the spit he brings to each soldier's face as he screams at them. Hugo Weaving does a great job as the alcoholic and abusive father that needs to deal with a troubling past, and Teresa Palmer whom I've never been a fan off pulls a great performance as Desmond's wife. Mel Gibson got really talented people to play the parts he has handed out and it shows.This movie is an incredible war film of faith, heart, humanity, and Violence and what it can do mentally to people. Mel Gibson has really outdone himself and I will be happy to see him be recognized as a great director once again.",10,7,14,13 November 2016
