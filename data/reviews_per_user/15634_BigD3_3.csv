Sucker Punch," One hot woman has delusions of even hotter women kicking some serious ass
","Sucker Punch is a stunning movie that's tries to give an inspirational message but falls a little flat on it's face. Emily Browning plays the hot and main character of Babydoll who is put in the Lennox house for the criminally insane and starts to have delusions to cope with the problems she faces, lose you yet? Yeah, part way into this film you lose interest in the story, actually if you watch the trailer you already know the entire plot, all that's left to watch is the what's in between. This movie sounds and looks beautiful (and not just because of the smoking hot leading ladies) that takes you into level upon level of delusion with repeating motifs and characters that bleed through. You don't really pull for the main characters, you actually lose track of which reality is real throughout but you love to watch the amazing special effects and the lovely ladies. A movie that might be beautiful to watch but doesn't really grab you with the story, more with cutting edge effects that actually increase in skill as the movie progresses, and scantily clad ladies that if you can find hotter ladies wearing less and kicking more ass in a movie than this, tell me, really... I'd really like to see that movie... As a warning, I must say that although the movie is only about an hour and a half, since there really isn't much of a plot the feel of the movie is much, much longer. Each level of delusion brings more and more impressive visuals but in turn loses the plot all together.NOTES: Emily Browning (Babydoll), Abbie Cornish (Sweat Pea), Jena Malone (Rocket), Vanessa Hudgens (Blondie), and Jamie Chung (Amber) are some of the hottest women of our generation. Oscar Isaac (Blue Jones) is the only main character that does any acting throughout the entire movie. Jon Hamm (Doctor/High Roller) and Scott Glenn (Wise Man) are used terribly, they have such bravado and acting potential but are only used sparingly. Also have to give mad props to Tyler Bates and Marius De Vries for making an incredible soundtrack.",Null,2,6,3 January 2012
127 Hours," One man's unmatched drive mixed with a beautiful but unforgiving situation pushes personal limits
","The camera work is great in this movie, the use of the regular movie work really establishes the grandeur of where this man is and how isolated he is along with adding a beauty to the desert he almost died in. Then when the scene transfers to the hand-held camera he carries along with him you really get to see inside his mind and what his thought processes is in such a difficult situation. James Franco (Aron Ralston) spends a lot of time alone on camera which really shows off his acting talent in a very psychologically thrilling way that makes you think, 'What would I do in this circumstance?' The will this man shows before, during, and after this all happens is just awe inspiring. The post movie montage is quite touching.NOTES: Aron Ralston (James Franco) does some impressive acting work. The way the camera shots are done are impressive and the scenery is impressive (Danny Boyle). The scene where Aron Ralston (James Franco) chooses to cut off his arm and hits his nerves is very intense.",Null,0,1,3 January 2012
Alexander," Alexander the Great could have ruled the world has his mother not been Angelina Jolie
","The story of Alexander the Great (Colin Farrell) is a great one to hear and read about, but to watch and hear the thoughts of those that the history is written about is purely amazing. The movie may or may not be historically accurate but the way it's told with Anthony Hopkins as the narrator entering the mind and suspected reasoning of Alexander is powerful. How the movie is separated into sections of Alexander's history is great too, how his early life was defined by his relationship with his seemingly evil mother, Olympias (Angelina Jolie) and his angry father, Philip (Val Kilmer) to his journey across the known worlds, all the way to his downfall.NOTES: Did not like the scene that turned red when Alexander (Colin Farrell) fell. Anthony Hopkins as the narrator is great. Cleitus (Gary Stretch) performance towards the end of the movie is strong. Colin Farrell had some strong scene's throughout the movie.",Null,2,3,3 January 2012
