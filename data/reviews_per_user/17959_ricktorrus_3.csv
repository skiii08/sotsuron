It," Overrated movie
",We're to begin with this OVERRATED movie. The plot and story line were really cliché typical Hollywood. The scares were nothing I thought it Will have a least a decent jump scare but no nothing. I was very disappointed by everything this movie had I only saw it because I am a huge bill skarsgard fan 'Hemlock Grove' and his acting in this film was disappointing. So many PEOPLE love cliché story line and typical acting no wonder there no good horror film that are original. If you love a cliché story line or just want to be like all the boring bore people that live this be my guest.,1,11,23,15 September 2017
Sinister," Okay film
",Sinister was a very interesting film I love the plot and premise of the film. I bought this film recently cause I love the cover for the DVD and thank god I did. The movie was very original and the cast were good. There is one part that I did not like it when the boy is inside the box and starts yelling that was a let down and typical. Also I don't see why people are saying its a extremely scary film it not just because of the cheap jump scares gimmick well anything that jumps at you when your not looking is scary. Overall I love this film and it is a film worth re watching a lot.,8,0,0,17 September 2017
The Conjuring," Terrible
",Oh god what did my wonderful eyes just witness this film was very bad I don't know why I even bother watching this piece of trash. The movie was very predictable and cheesy I not sure why a lot of dumb people enjoy this probably cause they are dumb. I only saw this for James wan cause I am a huge saw and dead silence fan and this was a complete waste of time. Really R rated this can pass as PG-13 don't know what the MPAA is on they are just dumb as well. I wish tat movies were like back in 2005 like saw and hostel were very good now there just cheap jumpscares and dumb demon ghost film Jesus what happening to horror.,1,2,3,15 October 2017
