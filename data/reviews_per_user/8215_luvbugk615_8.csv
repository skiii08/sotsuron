50 First Dates," It really makes you think, doesn't it?
","When i first watched this film it was about half three in the morning and was about to go to bed. Im glad to say that i am happy i stayed up to watch it. When i watched it for the first time i was just like 'Wow! Gotta buy this on DVD!' I thought it was absolute brilliance and such a great story. Sometimes i wonder how people come up with this stuff. A big hand to the writers i say! But it does make me think? What if this was happening to you? How would you feel? I know i would be like Drew, crying for hours. But, to keep your mind at rest, we watched this in physiology and it is no way that this would happen. Your short term memory is literally like a minute or two. So i guess you would only forget going to sleep Haha! Its a great film and recommend to all age groups! 10 out of 10!",10,0,0,14 November 2008
Catch Me If You Can," Awesome!
","This film has got to be one of my all time favourite movies. Not only has it got one of my favourite actors in (Leonardo Di Cario) but it is an awesome love story. They don't make films like they used to is what i say!It is great how it all comes together in the end! That is what i most love about this film. That you never know what is round the corner. Me, myself, loves all sorts of films. From rom-coms to war films. What can i say? Awesome film. I could watch it over and over again. I've already seen it a billion times and I'm still not bored of it yet! Great acting and great choosing the actors for the parts! I recommend this film to anyone to likes to see a damn good movie. 10 out of 10. Amazing!",10,1,3,10 November 2008
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," I loved it!!! The First Ten Times!!!
","I've seen this film many many times. Ill admit i absolutely loved it, watched it like 3 times a week at least! Basically its about a cartoon along with real life, its so cool, and was like the first time i had seen something like this... it came out before i was even born.This film is great for children maybe even a family sort of film. But let me advise you; do not watch it to much because then it wont seem very good. Just like it doesn't with me.If you like funny films then this is great. If you like mystery films then its also very good! I sill watch this film every now and then because it was one of my favourite films at one time! Great!But its great I give this 9 out of 10!",9,0,0,13 November 2008
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Hilarious!
","This film is fantastic. But i only advise teenagers to watch it... unless your an adult with a strange humour who likes a lot of swearing, blasphemy and rudeness. It truly is hilarious.I've always liked the series but not very much. The film is much better than any of the series. Now i dislike the series all together. It has changed way too much.This film is fantastic, with many funny bits. It is sort of like really life... only not so.! Haha! I recommend it to teens and maybe adults with a immature sense of humour! Buy this. Its actually buy-able! Because you can watch it more than once and not be bored! 10 out of 10 says me!!",10,1,1,13 November 2008
Juno," OK! but thats all.
","This film is about a girl who gets pregnant to her best friend! Thats basically it. I will admit i do like this film. But not too much. It is a bit pointless really. But at least it shows teenagers that having a baby ain't all its cracked up to be! This film is a bit funny, with a cool mellow sort of love story that comes together in the end. I like this film. But i have better films to watch! Great actors and actresses though.This film can be a bit boring. And when it gets to the end you can see how it is quite pointless. Apart from seeing a girl sat on the toilet! Haha! I doesn't seem very realistic to me and seems a bit stupid because to be honest if i went home and said Mum and Dad Im pregnant they would kill me, not say 'Well we best get you healthy!' I didn't even know you could put advertisements to adopt in the paper! Haha! I think the actors in this are quite something. Juno at the end is great actor at being in labour, and Micheal Cira is also great and a bit hot for all the girlie's out there! I recommend this film to teenagers, but to only watch it once! 6 out of 10! Sorry Juno!",6,2,8,11 November 2008
Titanic," I Love It!
","This has got to be one of my all time favourite movies! Gosh... not only has it got the gorgeous Leonardo Di Caprio, but it is just awesome! I've seen this film a billion times before and NEVER get bored of it! I watched it last night and it made me CRY and CRY and CRY for ages! I love this film. I recommend it to anyone. Im a fan of all sorts of movies and i think, what ever type you like, this one you will like as well even if your into war films, or comedies. This is great! 10 out of 10!Kate Winslet is beautiful for all the boys. If anyone watches this and says 'Oh, it is not that good' then they are lying. Although it is a remake of the older films, it is great because it has a love story in it. I love romantic films. Without this i believe it would not be half as good as what it is. This film is incredible. Great actors and actresses to play the parts! Great!",10,2,5,10 November 2008
Click," Did anybody else cry?
","This film is great. Since I've watched it and loved it, i had to go buy it and add it to my big DVD collection.This film is brilliant It has a great great moral behind it. I love it. I was nearly crying at the end though, so if your that sort of person be careful and prepared with some tissues.Great actors and actresses, i just love all of Adam Sandlers films, he is a great great funny man.Also this film is a bit funny.I recommend all ages to watch this, old, young, teens, dog, cat LOL everyone. Because it is a truly great film My rating is 9 out of 10!!",9,1,3,13 November 2008
The Wizard of Oz," Musical Masterpiece!
","I personally honestly think that there isn't many people that do not like this film. I think just about everyone has heard of it or seen it. But what is the verdict? Well... i definitely say '10 out of 10! One of my favourite films. Can watch it time and time again. Great musical and great actors and actresses.' And I'm sure many other people think this also. Winning two Oscar's is quite a big thing. Its one of the oldest films i know... actually i think it is the oldest film i know.Its such a great film to say that it is so old. 1939, wasn't that during the war! I don't know.What i do know is that, loads, thousands and thousands of people love this film. And I'm proud to say, I'm one of them! I recommend to anyone and everyone! Watch it if you haven't!",10,5,6,11 November 2008
