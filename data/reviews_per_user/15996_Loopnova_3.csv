Sucker Punch," good enough could have been better
",the negative review s for this film are not entirely wrong.there wasn't enough dialog in the film .the main character in the film doesn't say a word for a good twenty minutes into it. the story is very hard to understand.it's very conceptual and it's quite unrealistic.that might not sit well with many.for me it was a good movie we all know the graphics were amazing. Zach Snyder has done it again.the action sequences were great to watch.but I think the whole movie relied on his graphics too much.300 was great not only because of the graphics but because it had a great story and an amazing script.in these aspects I feel sucker punch fell short.i know it's the type of movie in which too much dialog would have ruined it as well and made it feel disrespectful.but there should have been more dialog that would have expressed the story to the viewers in a better way and they would have connected more to the movie.without the dialog it all unfolded before us and it left me with this weird left-out feeling.all in all I must say it was good movie.great graphics amazing soundtrack but with a little bit more script and a slightly less complicated story it could have been amazing.so I can say great potential but a it relied too much on Snyder and the Soundtrack.what made it worse was that the movie had two genres acting at once.on one hand it was really dramatic/depressing on the other hand it was this action movie.they should have just gone with one genre.this just confused every thing in the movie,7,0,1,23 June 2013
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," action filled,thrilling,good graphics and a modest script
","i'm neither a fan of action movies nor do I like those modern remakes of fairy tales but despite all that this still managed to win me over.it was nothing like I had expected it to be.i figured it's going to be a kids movie with the whole witch hunter concept to make it cooler,but I was dead off.the action in the whole movie was just epic.it has a lot of gore.witches' heads flying off.there's a lot of cursing and some nudity so well you have been warned.the script was modest.not the most impressive script ever but it still was enough to keep you engaged.what really made the movie great was the acting and the whole chemistry between Hansel and Gretel.they really convinced me.i loved Jeremy Renner as Hansel but I was most impressed with Gemma Arterton.i have never sen any of her other stuff so I was shocked at her acting ].she did a really good job.the movie also had some negatives.it was a little predictable.it might have gotten a little lost on the audience it was targeting.fairy tale means kids,blood and gore means teenagers nudity means at least 18.so it's a reason for the slightly low rating I loved it because it was a kickass action movie with really good graphics and it still managed to maintain a story and keep it relevant.basically means that if you took away the action the story would still be enough to intrigue you.a lot of blood and gore so you should probably keep that in mind....that said it was a badass movie period",7,0,1,30 June 2013
The Hangover Part III," doesn't even feel like part of the franchise
","it was quite bad.i wouldn't have even minded it if it was like part2.at least it felt part of the franchise and had its funny bit,what i'm trying to say is that it was tolerable.you could link both the parts together.this seemed so alienated from the franchise.et me elaboratethe most important point to mention here is that there was no hangover.can you believe it?a hangover movie without a hangover.secondly in the previous parts the series of events usually led from one disaster to another that made the whole movie funny.but in this part nothing terrible ever happens.i mean it's just they go from one place to another.the first half of the movie wasn't extremely terrible it had some funny bits but in the second half i just kept waiting for something to happen the movie even ended and i kept waiting for the hangover.seriously i am so bummed there was no hangover a lot of people blamed chow for ruining it but i don't think any character should be blamed for this disaster.the thing that made this movie terrible was the uncontinuity of the story from the previous parts and the whole storyline in general it seemed like they just tried their best to finish the trilogy to get done with it or something its a terrible movie and probably won't get many positive reviews but look on the bright side at least it's the last part,right?",Null,1,2,22 June 2013
