Kill Bill: Vol. 2," too slow, less intriguing
","Kill Bill Vol. 2  3/5The second installment of Kill Bill provides the background information about the first film. We see the Kung Fu training of the Bride, her wedding massacre and a buried-alive scene in a graveyard.  Bill explains why the Bride was supposed to be killed off and the four year-old daughter of Bill and the Bride makes an appearance near the end.There are some funny moments but this episode is far more laid back and less interesting than the first one.  If the first film was a 5/5, this slower one has to be only 3/5.  Definitely not the exciting blockbuster that the first one was.Review by Triniman",6,0,1,16 April 2004
The Alamo," too long and sentimental
","I decided to see this film in order to get a historical perspective on what happened at the Alamo (in San Antonio, Texas.)  Being a Disney film, however, it unfortunately wallowed too much in sentimentality to be a must-see production.You do get a sense of the hopelessness of the Americans holding out against the Mexican Army, but that's not how the films ends.  Sure enough, in order to attempt to be a crowd-pleaser, the Americans have to end up in victory.Bill Bob Thornton plays Davey Crockett who just a good ol' boy known as a legendary modern day hero. Even the Mexicans know this.  Like the Mexican General, the Crockett character grins too much for his own good.Jason Patric plays the famous knife fighter Jim Bowie.  You're just waiting for the classic Crocodile Dundee line, `That's not a knife. This is a knife' when Bowie practically pulls out a machete.  His character is dour and not very likely.Overall, this film would have benefited from being about an hour shorter.Review by Triniman",5,2,7,14 April 2004
Van Helsing," uninvolving, juvenille
","Van Helsing  1/5After the film, my friend turned to me and said `Aren't you sick of the over-use of computer animation in movies these days?' With Van Helsing, the answer is a resounding YES!  This is yet another film that proves that special effects alone cannot make up for a lousy script.  The best special effects are still the ones you don't know are special effects.With VH going after vampires and werewolves at the same time, you just knew this was going to be a compromise.There's nothing particularly scary in the film. The best monster of all happens to be Dr Frankenstein's monster, who actually does have a heart and a mind.  Hommage is paid to James Bond Q department and maybe a bit of Indiana Jones and Spiderman.  Unlike Indiana Jones, the Van Helsing character is humourless, flat and uninvolving.  The first Spiderman film had a heart.  This film has virtually no pulse.With a rating of PG-14, you knew Van Helsing was going to be a juvenile, silly affair, and it hits the mark precisely.  There's got to be a video game version coming soon.  Is it worth seeing again or buying on DVD?  I don't think so.  Let's hope there won't be a sequel.Review by Triniman",2,0,0,8 May 2004
Collateral," refreshing thriller - Cruise and Foxx are excellent
","4/5The premise sounds pretty dull, doesn't it? Tom Cruise plays a hit man who coerces a cab driver to drive him around LA to knock off five people. Jamie Foxx portrays the reluctant cab driver. Director Michael Mann proves that a compelling drama doesn't require an excess in plot, car chases or violence or humour. Much of the film takes place in the cab with Cruise and Foxx exchanging philosphies of life, goals and dreams. Foxx, a cabbie for 12 years, wants to save up to open a limo service. Cruise is more enigmatic about his past, but instead is a relentless, cold-blooded assassin. Still, he's not one-dimensional at all.Cruise is excellent as the laser-focused killer with taste. Witness the scene in the jazz club to see how good his taste in music is. He's not cocky like the mastermind bad guy in the first Die Hard, but he is cool confident and obviously emotionally detached from his victims. He doesn't care who they are since he's just doing his job. He also doesn't flash the million-dollar Cruise movie star smile.Jamie Foxx also performs well as the uncomfortable cabbie counterpoint to the Cruise character. He's just your average joe hoping to get ahead in life but obviously taking a long time to get there, just like most people.What's refreshing about this film is that it doesn't scatter the character development over too many players. The lack of comedic lines also reinforces the grittiness of the script. Michael Mann has produced a mostly believable thriller, that makes the competition look like cartoons for adults. Sure, there are stretches in the storyline but so long as you're prepared to gloss over them, this is a fine film. Collateral is also much better than Cruise's last film, the pretentiously bloated The Last Samurai. Anyone looking for a non-stop action film or a 'Lethal Weapon'-type film should look elsewhere.Review by Triniman.",8,0,0,6 August 2004
Alien vs. Predator," promises too much potential for fans of either series to pass up
","2/5  Alien Vs. PredatorTake two well-known sci-fi franchises and merge them into a film in such a way that you can be assured of a huge audience, but also, that the sum is greater than the parts.  Or as great.  This film isn't it.  Alien Vs. Predator is a cold, calculated `product' that is too contrived and formulaic to provide much intrigue or entertainment value.  And the most amount of suspense is provided courtesy of a penguin.A corporate satellite, searching for evidence of natural resources, detects a significant amount of heat coming from an island in Antarctica.  The billionaire head of the company quickly hobbles together an expedition team to investigate what appears to be a pyramid with Aztec, Egyptian and Cambodian traits, located 2000 feet below the surface.The pyramid contains walls and floors that shift every ten minutes and hieroglyphics that are interpreted by one of the crew, to give them some sense of what they have found.  The maze provides so much overkill that an Indiana Jones or Tomb Raider fan would blush. The humans get into the maze, the face huggers do their thing and you have a nice population of Aliens for the Predators to hunt.It takes one human to `birth' an Alien, so why are there so many Aliens in the place?  The gestation period took hours in the first Alien film, but here they seem to pop out with greater frequency.  The dialogue appears to be written by a 6th-grader.  There are no outstanding characters in the film, like a Ripley from the Alien series, although they try to create one in `Lex' Woods, played by Sanaa Lathan.  There's virtually no character development, so when they get killed, you don't feel anything.  Lance Henriksen plays the billionaire.  In one scene, he briefly does the `knife' trick from the Aliens film, where he played a `synthetic human.'This film is an empty-calorie spectacle that doesn't satisfy, yet it promises too much potential for fans of either series to pass up.  At least we find out who taught humans how to build pyramids.Review by Triniman",4,1,2,14 August 2004
Hellboy," better than the Hulk, Daredevil or the LXG
","This was a very enjoyable film and should spawn a sequel or two.  The only question is, since this is one of those 'save the world' films, what do you do for an encore?Ron Perlman was excellent as the blue collar hero.  But rather than be a simple caricature, we saw Hellboy's deep feelings emerge for one of his fellow teammates, whose powers resemble those of an X-Men 2 mutant.  The scene with him spying on her from a rooftop while she was on a date was really funny and somewhat tender at the same time.The mysterious Nazi in the 'gas mask' is revealed eventually and he slices and dices his way through the film like a martial arts expect with truncheon-like steel blades.  The CGI monster looks like a cross between a squid, a warthog and a wolf.  There's proof that this film doesn't try to take itself too seriously when Hellboy battles one of these creatures with one hand while holding onto a box of kittens in the other.  The comment he makes will crack you up.At times, the story is a bit convoluted and would require a second viewing to follow closely.Hellboy is a new cinema icon and so long as Perlman is able to play the role with humour and human feelings, much like Tobey McGuire's Spiderman, we have the makings of a franchise.  It's not as superb as the last X-Men film but Hellboy the character is much more charismatic that the Hulk, Daredevil or any of the cast from The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.Review by Triniman",7,0,0,2 April 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," highly original, surreal, romantic and sad
","A lot of people will see this film expecting a gushy date film or chick flick.  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is nothing of the sort.Jim Carrey provides his most vulnerable performance, serious performance to date.  Kate Winslet is the Gen Xer who is both desirable and yet difficult at the same time.  Both actors portray characters who are against their usual types.Winslet's character (Clementine)decides to erase her memories of the Carrey character (Joel).  Upon learning this, Joel opts for the same procedure. However, while his memory is being erased, he changes his mind as he relishes the good memories he had with her.  We see flashbacks that morph between one another, in settings that become surreal and dream-like.  At times, it's humorous and poignant but not overly sentimental.This film falls a bit short, though, of providing a knockout impact. Still, it's unique and daring.  Written by Charlie Kaufaman, screenplay writer for 'Being John Malkovich' and the brilliant 'Adaptation.  Go see this with an open mind and patience, otherwise take your date to something more pedestrian.by Triniman",Null,0,1,21 March 2004
The Bourne Supremacy," not overly sentimental
","4/5Loses a star for being basically the same idea as the first film - the CIA is trying to kill him and he is on the run.  Like the last time, he's willing to fight back.Kudos for the writers for not making this an overly sentimental film.  The main bad guy in the film is a relentless Russian Secret Service agent, who reminds me of the Serbian sniper from the film Behind Enemy Lines.They say the adult thriller genre faded away after being peaking in the 70s. Hopefully, more quality thrillers will be made once this film is confirmed in a few days as a bona fide smash. Also, rent the astonishing sleeper film Spartan, if you enjoy the Bourne films.Worth seeing if you liked the first one.by Triniman",8,2,2,24 July 2004
