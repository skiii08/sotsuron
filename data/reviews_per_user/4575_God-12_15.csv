The New World," Amazingly bad - a good candidate for worst film of the year.
","We went to see this film about Red Indians because the film about happy cowboys doesn't come out until next week.I thought of walking out a number of times, but wondered just how bad it could be - it was truly dire. This film is a pretentious waste of anybody's time. The acting is so bad that it is funny at times - as are the numerous mistakes. The one I liked particularly is a shot of a child eating an enormous bright yellow mielie, as produced by top agribusiness today as if that's what they had back then. The English court scene would have been an embarrassment if acted in a junior school play.The acting, if you can call it that, is of the standard that South African films used to have - all the characters are wooden, nearly all the time. The extras look like very uncomfortable extras in unfamiliar clothes. The plot, such as it is, based on historical events, unwinds with painful and obvious slowness - but still has huge gaps in it.The achingly obvious message the film ponderously tries to hammer home is, I suppose, thought by the producer to be subtle.Oh, dear, what an amazing crock of shite - avoid at all possible costs. Unless you find continuity errors and anachronisms amusing.",1,2,9,19 February 2006
Troy," See the dvd of 'Helen of Troy' instead
","Oh, dear!Let me mention the good bit first, to be kind. Peter O'Toole gives Priam's speech pleading for Hector's body very well indeed and it is close to the original. That was the only high point of the film.Otherwise the acting was poor. Achilles looked like John Travolta when he returned in 'Pulp Fiction' - bloated, wooden and past it - though, to be fair, John Travolta acted in 'Pulp Fiction' the hammy posturing of Brad Pitt was, I think, the worst 'performance' he has produced yet.The wooden horse itself is a discrace, poorly cobbled together and ugly. Silly mistakes are made - a huge speech explains how important treating the dead properly is to the Greeks, next thing we see a beach littered with bodies left to rot in the sand by the Greeks. Helen of Troy has a peculiar accent that jars and they keep mispronouncing Menelaus' name. Statues all appear wearing loincloths (something only prudish Hollywood would inflict on them!) and made out of poor plaster so it just takes a knock and they fall into powdery bits. It's like an old low-budget B-movie. Don't they know that they made statues out of marble then?The siege of Troy lasted 12 years - this film makes it appear that it is all over in less than a month.Watch the DVD of 'Helen of Troy' instead - it manages the time properly, has good acting, an excellent horse and doesn't go on and on with the battles (in this film they are treated like car chases in Hollywood films - something to fill in hours of time with no thought or dialogue needed).This film should have gone straight to video with a health warning.",1,2,7,20 May 2004
Brokeback Mountain," Probably the most boring film of the decade
","Don't even think about going to see Brokeback Mountain - it is certainly the worst, most boring, film of the year. It might even be the worst film of the decade.I hardly ever walk out of films, but I had to walk out of this half way through. Watching paint dry would be more exciting.It is a complete con. Not only are the cowboys not homosexual (they just f uck each other out of boredom - it is odd that the audience didn't do the same, really) but they aren't cowboys, they're sheep herders. There is hardly any dialogue and what there is is utterly unconvincing. The acting could be done as well by tailor's dummies.I'm not really sure if I should say more about how bad it is because it might make you think that it is one of those films that are so bad that they are funny. Nope. This one is the utter dregs of film making - I seriously thought of asking for my money back.I'm cross. I've wasted good money and a whole hour of my time hoping that it might improve.The cinema was packed too - quite wicked. All those people diddled out of their money.",1,13,79,12 March 2006
Hotel Rwanda," Everybody human should see this film about humanity
","We went to see this film today.Wow! What an experience it was. Usually Verity and I discuss a film after we've watched it and compare our reactions. After watching this today we found not a word to say.It is profoundly moving in many ways. I enjoyed the main protagonists ability to negotiate so cleverly from positions of utter powerlessness. I felt the build up of hatred realistic, tangible and terrifying. There were few cardboard characters, even the motivation of the most brutal, avaricious, vengeful and cruel was believable. The frustration felt at the utter indifference of the west by those who were betrayed, coupled with their helpless dependency brought a vivid light to what it was like to be utterly ignored by those believed to be friends.The stark moral choices were those that I think most of us would fear ever to confront, knowing how little how we would actually behave in that situation.The acting was superb.I think that everybody ought to watch this film - not least to learn more of just what it means to be human.-- It is an unalterable law that people who claim to care about the human race are utterly indifferent to the sufferings of individuals - Quinten Crisp, Resident Alien *",10,1,1,10 June 2005
The Exorcist," Disappointing
","I missed the film at its first release and have been looking forward to it ever since. I saw it last week and felt it rather weak on suspense, low on horror and far too full of pointless god bothering. The plot was disjointed - all that stuff in the beginning had virtually nothing to do with the rest of the film.",6,0,3,5 November 1998
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Tediously self-indulgent
","Why on earth do they inflict these terribly long films on us? It is pure self-indulgence and, though this film was nothing like as bad as that awful 'Titainic' film, it suffered horribly from bloat. They could easily have cut two hours out of the film and have been left with a reasonably good one.The first hour wasn't bad. Actually there were some interesting episodes. The novelty of the age thing was played fairly well - by the middle of the film, in his forties, it was sagging badly, no longer novel and not really working.They should have had more actors. The makeup wasn't bad, it's true, but trying to make people in their forties look as if they are in their twenties simply doesn't work, even though it was clear that they'd tried very hard with their photoshop style special effects.I was dragged to this by my wife - I'd recommend resisting it if yours tries this! It really is far, far too slight a plot with actors too insubstantial to carry all that time.Voice overs are lazy - with a very short film you can understand that they are there to overcome the time limitation with this long tedious film there was no such excuse.",2,7,14,15 March 2009
Garden State," Film on Existentialism
","I'm not suggesting that it is a film not to be missed, but 'Garden State' is a quite unusually intelligent Hollywood film. It appears to be a modern re-write of Camus' 'L'Etranger' (The Stranger/The Outsider) without the murder, but with a brief nod to the African element.The photography is pretty good with some amusingly ironic shots - nothing too subtle, of course, but not simply slapstick. The script isn't bad and seeing a Yank film tackle the subject of existentialism so sympathetically is rather encouraging - not everybody there is a mad axe-wielding fundamentalist, we know theoretically, but it is nice to have practical reassurance.If you've nothing better to do, or want to rent a reasonable film for the evening, I can recommend it. The sentimentality is a little excessive, but, for Hollywood, it is remarkably restrained and even, at times, almost tasteful emotion. As you'd expect, it does hammer the point home rather more than is necessary, but not to the extent that it becomes irritating.-- Spoilers follow I realise that I ought to give more detail of how the film explored existentialism - those who haven't seen the film might wish to stop reading here.<ul><li>The opening scene with the stark Spartan minimalist bedroom makes a point of the protagonist's alienation from the world. He is a cipher, a zombie, a person with no aims. His being on lithium is a metaphor for being distanced from life - stripped of affect.</li></ul><ul><li>His reaction to the message of his mother's death is intentionally lacking in affect. As with Meursault, he is an outsider, a stranger to the world, who sees it drained of colour (hence the white bleached room).</li></ul><ul><li>His reactions to his old friends are as to strangers. His friends live in a state of alienation from each other and the world 'living' lives of profound emptiness - they dispute with each other who has the more meaningless life and all end depressed, realising that they all have.</li></ul><ul><li>The rich friend who has his money from a fatuously useless invention tries energetically to find some meaning for his life and fails completely.</li></ul><ul><li>His father, the psychiatrist, sees the only resolution in suppressing all meaning and feeling making his son as numb to life as he is - this part is particularly well acted, I felt, with the robotic shell of a man, clever, able, but lacking any purpose other than a vague feeling of duty brilliantly portrayed.</li></ul><ul><li>The gravedigger and grave robber, his old friend, robs his mother of her jewellery without any moral compunction - he is amoral as a result of his emptiness. He passes it on to the fence without any concern at all.</li></ul><ul><li>He interacts with the girl in a superficial manner. She falls in love with him, but he sees simply short term carnal pleasure - which is why he is at first prepared to simply go back to his empty 'life' and continue as before.</li></ul><ul><li>The redemption occurs when his grave robber friend sees his lack of affect, realises that something is wrong and goes, with him, in the quest into the void to recover meaning - the trinket with balls that he stole from the corpse.</li></ul><ul><li>The protagonist starts to realise that his life needs changing when his mother dies - in a theoretical way. So he stops the lithium - that is he makes himself more open to experience and understanding. Some of the affection the girl has for him seeps through. He feels some connection with the trinket and can think again about the circumstances of his mother's death and crippling. He realises that his life has been affected profoundly by the trivial matter of a plastic fastening being poorly manufactured - no great meaning has led to his emptiness, only triviality. This emphasises the lack of meaning in life.</li></ul><ul><li>When he gets back on the aeroplane to return to his old life, the horror of the emptiness starts to get to him and he realises that he has to manufacture his own meaning - starting with the girl. This gestalt moment is the coming together of the threads in the film, and still lacks effect. Though he has understood the need for meaning we see, as the film ends, that he has a lot more work to do to make this meaning work for him.</li></ul>The grave robber is the equivalent of the prosecutor in Camus' novel. Most of the rest is the same. The literal use of a void to depict a void - and a number of the other literal images and metaphors are what you'd expect from a Yank film, but they are still pretty effective.",9,12,23,3 January 2005
Mulholland Drive," Tediously failed attempt to be clever.
","I am sorry I was mislead by reviewers to see this bit of tedious nonsense. It clearly is trying far too hard to be clever - and failing. The situations do not convince, the acting is poor and the hollywood references both obvious and naive. The plot is straightforward, once you see the game being played and actions are signalled well in advance.I really think that this is a modern version of the 'Emperor's New Clothes'. Pretending to like it, or see some profundity in it may seem necessary if you are surrounded by other poseurs doing the same - resist the temptation.If you want a good bit of surreal action go to see Amilie - it succeeds in every point where this film fails.",2,1,5,20 April 2002
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Quite fun, but not really up to scratch
","This is a real let down if you are expecting a real bit of Sadean fun. Instead you have a middle class suburban mini orgy. It would be nice to see this film made properly one day, on a reasonable budget, but it probably won't be soon.",8,1,6,12 May 1999
Titanic," Not only utter tripe, but also far, far too long.
","If you like really, really bad acting, then this enormously boring film is just the film for you! The plot is tedious and obvious. The film technique makes it difficult to tell what the special effects are - this is achieved by making everything look as if it is a badly executed special effect. You could cut two and a half hours from this film and, though it still wouldn't be any good, it would be a lot less bad.",1,3,11,27 December 1999
The Fountain," Undiluted tripe
","f you have some paint to watch drying choose that activity rather than watch this load of bullocks.The film mainly consists of people looking soulfully into the middle distance whilst wearing pajamas. It seems to be trying to appeal to aged hippies who have had seriously bad strokes after years of extreme drug abuse - they'd be able to feel intellectually superior to the protagonists.Sadly I really did have two hours that I had to kill, so I watched this utter tripe right to the end. It didn't get any better.The plot, if you want to call it that, is to do with curing cancer and eternal life - but it doesn't seem that sure which or what. It pulls the poor Aztecs into the rubbish, as well as the Spanish Conquistadors and some gratuitous violence with Inquisition bashing (as if there are serious supporters of the Inquisition around today who might be offended). Rings feature a lot - presumably hoping for some sort of 'Lord of the Rings' tie-in.That's enough. I'd give it -5 out of 10, and that's generous.Don't even watch it on DVD.It does have one use, I suppose, you could give it the DVD to your mother-in-law if you really hate her but don't have the guts for real revenge.",1,9,19,7 February 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," An unimaginative bore
","It is strange to see a film so lacking in imagination. Two hours and a half with, apart from some obvious and puerile slapstick, no humour or irony is a bit wearing. Yankland set in the future with some chaps with funny hats on seems a pretty feeble thing to imagine too.All the required plot details (to fit in with the sequels already shown) are ploddingly filled in, with no flair, surprise or twists. Characters are all cardboard cut-outs with good and evil sketched out as immiscible options taken up with for arbitrary reasons just like deciding what sports team to 'support'.The physics is mainly nonsense, with space ships making noises in space, needing wings to manoeuvre and having a slipstream so things attached to the surface can be blown off.The irritating green toad-like creature that obviously imagines that speaking ingrammatically makes prosaic truisms appear profound is on stage far, far too long. It also exhibits peculiar traits like walking with a limp and needing a stick at times, but, at other times, leaping about like a flea.The visual effects are at much the same level as the other films in the series - worse in places where they've tried to make large panoramic views interesting but fail giving a mushy appearance to it all. It won't give much away to say that I quite enjoyed the scene where huge ash trays were used as missiles - though it was irritating to know that the green toad wasn't going to be crushed by one.The Babylonian imagery of the funeral was well done.It would be much improved, and cut down to two hours, by cutting out the slushy bits and those where characters ponder frowningly for ages whilst deciding which of two straightforward options to choose - one gets the impression that the collective sum of the IQs of the characters can't be much more than 100.What a waste of celluloid. It wasn't even truly and grimly bad like 'Troy' or 'Titanic'.I look forward to the Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy",3,3,6,19 May 2005
Amélie," Perfection!
","The film is a perfect delight! The opening credits are packed with delightful and touching snippets of humour and the comedy continues without a break until the very end. It is also the story of a very naughty, but attractive girl and a nostalgic view of Paris. Well up to 'City of the Lost Children', even if considerably less surreal. This film might well be understood by some Americans, though I have seen at least one well known film reviewer utterly incapable of coming to grips with it.",10,0,1,16 April 2002
Valkyrie," Why put Tom Cruise into a film with real actors?
","OK, so the underlying plot was that a Yank did the decent thing on the Nazi side while the Yanks won the war on the other side - nothing changes with the Hollywood view!It was all the fault of the Pom who didn't act quickly enough.So far, so normal.What were they playing at, though, putting Tom Cruise into a film while they employed some real actors? He's wooden enough in a dummy show, but it's quite painful seeing him alongside some genuinely excellent actors - what were they doing in a film like this, by the way??There were some bad actors - the chap playing Hitler would have been out-acted if replaced by Miss Marple, but even he was head and shoulders above Tom. Cruise isn't just a bad actor, he's a table.",3,8,15,19 May 2009
V for Vendetta," Anti-fascism romp
","This is a most enjoyable re-hash of the '1984'. One of my long time heroes, good old Guy Fawkes gets a fitting memorial - though, as a point of accuracy, he wasn't hanged, he was hanged, drawn and quartered.The film does have some other problems with accuracy. The descent into fascism, seen in the UK, has been a major part of Phony Tony's control-freakery and the New 'error of judgement' Labour puritanism - the film, at one stage, appears to suggest that such fascism might arise out of a Conservative government, the proof is, of course, in the pudding - ID Cards, trying to get rid of trial by jury, abolishing constitutional checks, running the government with a group of low-life cronies rather than parliament etc. etc.. Still, they probably couldn't have got the funding if they'd made the truth plain!The film echoes some scenes from Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' very well - but the music is, of course, much better. The 1812 finale is quite magnificent, a scene of great delight, the sooner life follows art in that regard the better!It is a nicely stylistic film, also literate in its references - if a bit self-consciously so, in a sort of sixth-formish manner.It knocks the pants of the portrayal of Capote as a piece of entertainment. Also, unlike Capote, you can hear every word, which makes a film so much less self-indulgent.One of the humorous vignettes was Stephen Fry admitting that, well, yes, he might be a bit of a pansy if you put it that way - beautifully done!It should be required viewing for anybody who hasn't seen the picture of the way in which New 'error of judgement' Labour has screwed the country.Oh, yes, and the bits about dealing harshly with the ex-colonies is very funny.",8,1,4,26 March 2006
