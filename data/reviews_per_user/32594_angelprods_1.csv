The Legend of Bagger Vance," It's good film stock spoiled.
","Many people who are not enamoured of golf say, 'It's a good walk spoiled.' This picture leads me to say, 'It's good film stock spoiled.'  I could go on and say, too,  'It's a lot of talent and money wasted.'  without fear of being too harsh.  I actually tried to sleep through the lazily contrived and inept plot, but the music was very noisy, so try as I might, I couldn't dream up something more interesting.  If there had been a spark of chemistry between the two principals, that might have made a difference, but Charlize Theron is too mature and just plain too much woman for Matt Damon.  She was much better, more effective when she was paired with George Clooney and James Spader.How is it possible for the Robert Redford who made Ordinary People so extraordinary to make this Legend so forgettable?",5,0,1,27 October 2000
