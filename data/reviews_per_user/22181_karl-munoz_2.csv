Black Swan," Solid Effort
","Black Swan is a very good film, but not nearly as great as most people made it out to be. Barely a surprise though, since it was already a very good film 45 years ago when Roman Polanski shot it and called it 'Repulsion'. Personally, I though it reminded way too much of this (and a few other) Polanski film(s). Lonely, kind of obsessive, superbly beautiful girl that's reluctant, almost afraid, of relationships, descends into madness And Aronovsky is very good, but he is no Polanski, at least when it comes to the psychological thriller part. After a point, everything is, or could be, a delusion, which is kind of irritating because you are only left with assumptions of what actually happens. You know what you see is Nina's paranoid view of things, but it's so overwhelming that you're left wondering about almost every scene, which is a bit too much.Of course, the film is, in the end, on par with some of the best films of its kind, but that's mostly thanks to Natalie Portman's (even more) fabulous (than usual) presence...and a lesbian scene between her and the also wonderful Mila Kunis.Just those two actresses alone is worth the price of the DVD.",7,0,4,2 April 2012
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Almost great
","Die Hard 1 and 2 were just incredible, and this is yet another great installment in the great Die Hard movies. Not quite as good as the first two, but very good. You have Bruce Willis running around New York with a partner who has a problem with white people trying to get him killed. There is great action sequences including a bomb in a train. It's another roller-coaster ride for Bruce's character John McClane and us as well. The plot is a little dumb at times but from a third action movie that's good anyway, you really don't notice. The acting was also good. Jeremy Irons is a really good bad guy but not as good as Alan Rickman. Most of the time, Bruce and Sam just cuss at each other but it was nice to see Bruce paired up with someone with even more attitude than him. It's a really good movie but the violence and language are not really for kids.",8,0,0,2 April 2012
