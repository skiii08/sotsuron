Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Nothing can stop revenge
","Chapter 6....it goes on, the saga of the revenge of the bride, the great thing about this movie was it was all Bill, which surprised me, I figured he would've been kept mysterious right up to the end. The training with Pai Mei was the best part of the movie. Daryl Hannah actually for the first time was good in a movie, and fierce, wouldn't want to mess with her and her black mamba. Micheal Madsen although not appearing that threatening did almost end the movie on the bride in a scary way.Although a violent plotline, the movie does go deep in feeling and makes it look magnificent, which caused me to see the story for what it really was. It was really touching how she finally meets her daughter, and they lay it out for her there what is really going on, interesting how she takes that. The whole story felt like a big video game, and ended in satisfying way.  If you like vol 1. for it's violence and action don't bother with vol 2 cause you'll be disappointed. Vol 2 has a lot of things in there that are worth hearing which makes the movie so great.QT you finally gave me something great since Pulp Fiction, that I think could be watchable by almost anyone.Uma Thurman got bloody satisfaction!",Null,0,1,25 April 2004
Se7en," the most disturbing movie I have ever seen
","I first saw the movie 4 years ago when it first came out, I thought the trailer looked horrifying and I thought maybe this movie would be nothing, but then I saw it, and it was way more disturbing than the preview. Pitt and Freeman are really good together in this one. The movie was good throughout and then when Spacey entered the flick he made it even better, even though he was only in it for about 20 minutes.  He basically stole the show, he was the best bad guy I have ever seen to date. Right after the movie was over I was stunned all the way home, it scared me straight for awhile, and to this day I still haven't been able to forget the images of the film, this is one film that will stick with you for the rest of your life. Great flick!",Null,0,0,5 November 1999
Fight Club," A strange 2 and a half hour trip
","This is by far Fincher's most eye opening movie to date. The beginning of this movie was good and I was able to follow it well, but then after the second half you sort of get a bit lost, and you don't know what's going on, but then by the end it comes together and then it doesn't again. Norton and Pitt work well together, but a duo not to be forgotten. The movie brings up a lot of issues you are afraid to talk about, but then they just surface. This movie is not for everyone, so if you aren't used to movies that make you think don't see it, but you want a chance to explore things and yourself definitely check this movie out, this makes it on my top 10 for the year.",9,0,1,17 October 1999
Snatch," 4 stars
","I don't know about the rest of you..but I liked this film, it was quick, they never stopped for a second, it was what I expected to become of a british film.  This is the first time I have seen a Guy Ritche film, I must say I look foward to his next project.  Everyone was cool in this movie, Pitt was hilarious, Farina was just as big a thug as he was in Get Shorty, and Del Toro was quite a surprise pulling off that great accent, it's a shame he wasn't in it that long.The movie was rather violent, I sure wouldn't want to deal with these guys though, gangsters can be quite dirty with you. This film falls in with those great titles of Pulp Fiction and Trainspotting. The ending wrapped up like a orchestra hitting the last note very quickly and boom credits, very well done.Mr Ritche I look foward to your next project and try to bring along these people with you if you ever can.",Null,0,0,21 January 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," More than any man has ever seen
","I have never read the trilogy of the Lord Of The Rings, but after seeing this movie, I didn't think that I needed to. If you have never read the book then you would understand this movie.The story is good, nice good old fashion fantasy at its best. Takes me back to the Zelda days but this goes even further. The enemies are far greater and deadlier than anyone can ever imagine, as powerful as gods.The scenery was absolutely wonderful, just excellent work, and that stuff should win some oscars for it.Overall quite a good picture, makes fantasy so wonderful again, I am looking forward to the next one next Christmas.",Null,0,0,21 December 2001
The Matrix Revolutions," Not as bad as most make it to be
","Well for starters, I will say that it was better than Reloaded, but I still found the second film to be important to the 3rd film. The concepts and scenes I was able to grasp no problem, and I walked into this film expecting to hate it and bash it, but when it was over I couldn't do that....the movie was good, but really it was good for someone who follows the matrix, however I felt these 2 films had no connection with the first one at all. Which is why these films lacked any originality.I will watch it again...nothing will beat the first one really. The ending is very confusing and leaves it wide open, even for the most hardcore fans. It may all be make believe, but I would hope that this entire take on the matrix will evolve the human thought process of today, instead of people thinking it just looks cool. But lets call it over, and say as far as the matrix goes, it's over.",Null,0,0,9 November 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Best summer movie of 2003
","Arnold is finally back, looks just as great as he did the day he did T2. I was expecting the movie to be great and it was great, however as expected it would not surpass T2. Mr. Cameron can rest easy on that one, cause deep down we all know that nothing can beat T2, unless he decides to do a T4 which would be fantastic.I loved the action, could be even better than T2's action, but that still remains to be seen. Both Arnold and Kristanna carry the movie very well together, and they definitely have updated their ideas as far as technology goes. Nick Stahl who plays today's John Connor was alright but not great, the thing I am beginning to discover behind his character is he doesn't have much of one to begin with, even when you look at T2 with John you can sort of see the same thing. Claire Danes was pretty good as playing Kate Brewster and had some great emotion in her character.The only things I didn't like about it was it was missing the feel of soul, of humanity, the fact that machines were going to take over didn't really scare me that much in this one, I guess only cause in T1 and T2 we are told the stories of what happens and we can only imagine it which can be the true horror, but it would have been preferable if James Cameron were to illustrate that actual illusion because I know he can. The movie was too quick, as great as it was, we waited 12 long years for this and I think over 2 hours isn't too much to ask for.But all that aside, I loved the ending, definately leaves the door wide open for one more, but I don't want to wait another 12 years for it, maybe 5 years at most would be good, but we will for sure be back!",Null,0,0,3 July 2003
American Beauty," A film never to forget
","I just got back from seeing American Beauty, I was blown away by this film. This is probably the best film I have seen in a long time. It was definately worth the $9.50 I payed for it. Kevin Spacey gives a definate Oscar winning performance, he was very good in this, Annette Benning (sp?) a person I don't see act very often was so good that it looked so real. The young crew (Birch, Suvari, and Bentley) all did such good jobs that their carrers have nowhere to go but up. I never do this but I give this movie a definate 10/10, the highest I give any film is a 9 but this deserves a big fat 10! best movie of the year, hands down, go see it, you won't be disappointed!",10,0,0,24 September 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The Journey Continues....
","And it does, no intro or anything, it picks up exactly where 'The Fellowship' leaves off. The battle scene in the begining with Gandlolf was wicked, even though it was a dream.  Yes this part of the trilogy was much darker than the first one, but that's ok cause that's the way it should be. The special effects were amazing as always, the work on Gollumn was just superb, they made him a character that almost moved human like and had personality.  The battle of Helms Deep looked like tons of work was put in on that, and I got to appriciate that. The movie was basically divided into 3 stories within one and that was basically this movie. Aragorn looked more like a solid leader in this one, the dream sequences were enchanting between him and Arwen. The most inspiring part of the movie was at the end when Sam was telling Frodo a story inside a story about how generations from now will remember this as a tale to tell one another. Any scenes with Sam and Frodo were great. There is so much to say here that I won't cover it all, but well worth waiting a year for, and now we conclude the journey next year where the battle for middle earth really begins...on December 17th 2003.",Null,0,0,19 December 2002
The Incredibles," Pixar gets better and better
","This was the first time I decided to go and see a Pixar movie in a theater, and had been the first time I had seen an animated movie in a theater in...almost 10 years I'd say. I had seen for months and months the work and promos going into this movie, 'save the day' and boy oh boy they didn't disappoint. Pixar has blown my mind with this movie, when I went to see it, it was mostly older teenagers and adults, so you can see that Pixar is really starting to expand their audience. The movie didn't have to be funny, but when it was funny it was worth a laugh, but the action sequences, and animation was the real story here. I always relied on past Pixar films to get me with their comedy, but this movie was all action and superheros. For once I felt like a kid again seeing a movie that I totally went nuts over. Animation with Elastigirl was stunning, Mr Incredible's heart will own you, Dash was the fastest thing I had seen to ever hit the big screen, Violet is so quick to make you try to find her with her invincibility and the age old forcefield, Jason Lee as Syndrome was killer for me, as a bad guy I loved him. Edna Mode was hilarious and so well done.The movie has a lot of action in it, so if parents have taken their kids to see previous Pixar movies, approach it with caution as there is a fair share of violence, but it is done in good taste and enough that the whole family can enjoy it.Bravo Pixar! you all did it again! see it on the big screen, it is totally meant to be seen this way, and I can't wait for the DVD as I am sure the sound will be spectacular for home theater.Cars....2005",Null,0,1,5 November 2004
Amadeus," Nothing can compare to this one
","Seeing this movie for the first time at age 5 really hit me hard. And this was probably the first movie I ever saw, and to this day the movie still stuns me, I could never get tired of it, I still talk about the lines and the scenes to this day. Bravo to Milos Forman and the 2 top actors in this movie F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce, exceptional jobs. This is one of the few films I can see and agree on it winning Best Picture. Right to up the dark ending, the movie was hands down fantastic up to the last line....'Mediocrity....Mediocrity everywhere!'",Null,2,4,7 November 1999
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A good first half
","I always somewhat enjoyed some of the old Japanese sword fighting kung fu type movies, even though most of the time I never understood what they were saying, thank god for subtitles. Quentin Tarintino hasn't done anything to impress me since Pulp Fiction, this movie brings that element back of when everyone knew it was a movie out of the ordinary, had real memorable lines no matter how great or obscene they were, and always made you want to watch it over and over again because there was something you always wanted to catch again and again to see how you interpret it. At points it felt like a real challenging video game, which is what I really enjoyed about it, if you can get past the mega violence factor then this movie would be as enjoyable as 'The good the bag and the ugly' as Clint Eastwood's character the man with no name, where as Uma Thurman's character can be regarded as the same. Yes revenge can be cold, but for those who feel it hard enough, you will avenge with no other goal in mind, like a warrior.
All of the fight scenes were done well, best one was between the bride and go go yubarki, and the scenes were shot very well. Has a great look to it, and a rough but slick feel to it at the same time.Great movie, Quentin kept it straight to the point, not complicated at all, looking forward to volume 2. Uma Thurman will Kill Bill!",Null,0,0,10 November 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Great action and effects, but that's it...
","Well it's been awhile since I have written a review on movies that I have seen in the the theaters, so I figured I'd charm everyone with my first one of 2003.I'll get right to it, the first 30 minutes of the movie is stupid, but it needs to be there, I can obviously see how silly and boring life is on Zion. The action and special effects sequences are some of the best things I have seen in years. It actually leaves you wanting more, the scene where Neo fights about 200 Agent Smiths is mind tripping, and it makes you think just about any move is possible in this sequence. As far as the story goes and the parts where there was just talking, it seemed at times stupid and insulting. I'd rather not get into it as I will have felt dumber for typing it out. After having examined how the real world is in the city of Zion and the Matrix, well I choose The Matrix, it may not be real, but hey it's all up for debate, which is the only good thing left with this trilogy, which is the simple concept, but in this movie the concept feels a bit stretched out for the sake of it being done, which I felt was dumb.The movie tried to be bad ass when it couldn't, all the flying antics of superman like stuff was even dumber and unoriginal. I look forward to the conclusion in November and I hope it wraps up very well, but don't look for this movie to be the one that rocks this summer. As me and my friends were leaving the theater we went from thinking it was good to slowing thinking it was not so good, which then turned into jokes, but that's another story.Much respect goes out to the special effects crew as they all made it happen. Overall 7/10. Let's see a better concept for the next one and try not to be all Star Wars Prequel like with this.",Null,0,0,16 May 2003
Man on Fire," Makes you want to kill every last one of them
","Denzel Washington turns in another good performance here, although I don't think it was worth the $20 mill pay day. I really went to go see the movie for the fact I like almost any movie Tony Scott directs. He has worked with Denzel before, and it seemed to work out when they did Crimson Tide together, but this time around it got a bit more dark but it still worked. 
The story was straight forward and not much to it, not as violent as people make it out to be. Dakota Fanning is really going to go places, she was great in this. Movie coulda been shorter, no need to have a slow start. Christopher Walken and Mickey Rourke were almost non existant to the movie, so all that really mattered was Denzel which was fine with me.  It is sad to think that all of this is really going on in Mexico, that the police and law enforcement officials are in on some of the biggest kidnappings themselves there. The Mexican government needs to wake up and quit allowing such things to take place, not that this doesn't happen in other cities, but when it happens in other cities the people that get caught really wish they never were involved in police corruption. I guess the question is, is it proper to cheer for a guy going on a rampage and doing his own justice by tourturing and killing people for information? all I can say is I wish they had more guys like him, then terrorists would start being more afraid.",Null,0,0,5 May 2004
Vanilla Sky," Gaining knowledge is power
","Lots of people complain about not 'getting' this movie. If a movie is made to not let you think then you are only making yourself dumber for having sat through it, but not to criticize, I like to watch movies that just do all the entertaining for me now and then, but in time those movies become excessive and you just want to watch your favorite parts and suddenly it doesn't become a movie anymore it becomes a magazine where you just want to flip to your favorite articles and pictures instead of reading the whole thing.Cameron Crowe decided to make this movie to make you watch it over and over again just like he does with all his movies, he wants to make it so that even when it is on late night you won't want to turn it off cause you wanna go to sleep, you wanna watch it again and again and this is exactly what Vanilla Sky is.Like the movie 'Fight Club' I had a hard time getting it for a few days, and with Vanilla Sky it has been 12 hours or so since I watched it and I still can't get it out of my head. All I can say is 'open your eyes' try to let the movie take control of you and see where it leads you. And when you see where it has taken you cause I am almost sure everyone would have a different path with this movie, then you will see and you will have your anwser, the same thing can be said about love.Mr. Crowe continue to amaze me and I will keep seeing your films, keep it up!",Null,0,0,1 June 2002
Any Given Sunday," Good but too long
","Ok the movie was good here, and I liked everyone that was involved in this movie from Pacino to Diaz and so on. Now however I really enjoyed the first bit of this movie, but unfortunately Mr Stone the movie kept dragging and dragging and I never do this, but I started to become tired. I like long movies, but ones that need to be long, not this one, sorry guys, other than that, I thought it was good but I think Mr. Stone should stick with his usual political movies, he always has me liking those, Pacino was really the only thing that saved this movie. Stone stick to stuff like your normal stuff (JFK,NBK,Born on the 4th of July) otherwise not too bad",Null,0,0,9 January 2000
The Truman Show," Overhyped! yeah you heard me
","This film was too overhyped and at times boring. I like Jim Carrey he is a very good actor, and he didn't do that bad for a serious role. Ed Harris? well I've seen better from him, so I don't see why he should win an Oscar for this movie.Anyways the plot was fine but I think that we didn't need this film to prove to us that what we see on TV isn't real. But then again there are people out there who do believe what they see on TV but have no opinion on it.The way people were suckers for the Truman show in this film made me wanna vomit. It shows that people will follow someone's life on TV instead of their very own, it goes to show you what your own personal god can be.Overall it really isn't a masterpiece to me, and I was expecting a lot better for this film. Oh well but that's my opinion.",Null,0,0,14 March 1999
