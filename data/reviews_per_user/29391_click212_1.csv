Requiem for a Dream," Disturbing yet powerful
",It's hard to say that one can enjoy such misery. I found this movie disturbing yet quite powerful. For one thing it does not glamorize or romanticize the horror and reality of its subject matter. The performances were brilliant on everyone's part. The cinematography really set the pace and it is so close to the real life desperation that comes with the territory that I was riveted to it. It just took me along with it to it's painful end. Burnstyn and Connelly were both brilliant in this. Definitely not a Hollywood feel good vacuous time waster but well worth the cringe factor. There's no room for 'what if.' The story is linear and tragically inevitable. Painfully memorable.,10,0,0,27 April 2008
