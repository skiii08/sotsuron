Your Name.," Yes, yes and yes!
","Absolutely fantastic! Recommended for everyone.Just watch it.Amazing characters, scenery, city life and town life, story. Everything is just wow. So fine! The suspension, the empathy, the scenes. The thoughts. It's playful and pleasant, but serious and funny at the same time. It makes you want to feel it and live it, while you just keep cheering for everything.This 1.5 hours was one of the most well spent time in my life. It was so good, that I actually sit down and wondered why we can't we live like that? Why can't we be in that village? In that anime Tokyo?Every minute is a time well-spent. It's a time SO well spent, that I was afraid when it's going to end. I literally just realized that this would be the end of an anime. Than this would be the end of an hour long movie.I was so afraid when it's going to end. It borough such a beautiful and marvelous utopia before my eyes, with all it's mistakes, conflicts. That I actually wanted to live there. I actually realized however, that I'm not good of a person to be worthy of such utopia.However it is very close to reality. Every time something out of order happens, you remember. This is a certain reality. People can die, be ashamed, punished. Everything can end in a tragedy. But when something wrong happens, nobody really cares.. and I was like: 'Why? Why aren't you moving? Are you not afraid for your lives?' Than I remembered.. this is a certain utopia. Even for the people who live in it. Nothing bad happen to them, nothing really could. They are peaceful, good people, in a modern world. Nothing bad happened in the last 3 generation, why would anything happen now?This movie gave me a new set of feelings, viewpoints, happiness, thoughts and desires, I might have lacked or just not realized before. I'm really glad I watched it. It was a piece from my dreams.",10,230,333,10 September 2016
Wind River," Excellent, I really recommend it.
","No spoiler.Both main lead brings the stuff really well. Side characters are excellent. The writing is really good. The characters are lovable. The topic is great. The excitement, the tension, the action, they are all real.There are a lot of hints for the viewers. You can easily sympathize and live into the movie. It is dark, but not the 'I don't want', 'too much' dark. Just the right amount, so you want justice, but also learn from it, you grow somewhat.Excellent for adults.. but too much for kids. 18-20+ is a minimum for this. I'm not kidding. It's not that deep, but under that.. it's just not whole.I recommend this movie. It was well worth the ticket.",10,2,6,17 September 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," This was amazing.
","The movie is amazing! It binds you into the chair. The characters are amazing, the story is well written. The fight scenes both on the ground and in space are beautiful.Nothing is forced, everything as it should be. The movie is credible, it fits both for SW and normal viewers. I'm not sure of plot holes or small things etc, have to wait for smarter viewers.A movie experience from which you can walk out happily and satisfied. It's a fine movie. May the force be with you, always...as it seems I still need two more lines to make this an acceptable review. So.. The weather effects were amazing. The darkness was Star Wars like, and not the blind darkness you see in most movies. I know the critics like that because it's 'realistic', but I didn't bought my ticket to stare at a black blank canvas for two hours.The weapon fire and weapon usage really improved. I like how it has a soul. It's not just the effect, but the shooting itself. Really good. What else? The star ship! Most space movies love to be small on the variety, but this! A real fan service for Star Wars fans, and for sci-fy lovers the better. You can see so many different vehicles! Both in space and on the landing pads. One can believe that armies are fighting not just x wings and tie fighters.",10,2,7,18 December 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Horrible
","I would've give this movie a 5/10, but it's boring. Seriously boring.First of all, the movie is a generic teenage.. superhero movie. Filled with clichés. A lot of cliché. I really hate that they set Peter Parker as a pretty stupid person. Very stupid, very naive for a 15 yo lad. If you are 15 yo and would not cross any of what he did as stupid, than you have brain damage.Second, The movie is not faithful to the original work, or what you would expect from a Spider-Man movie. They dropped in some Star tech to basically skip everything, the web-shooting is the same. There is a whole 10 second when he invents the web-fluid. That's it. I understand that it would be boring, but they cut these things and it's even more boring. How?The camera work is okay for mid budget movie. The director thrown in some special 'camera work' which is around 2-5 minutes long, and will annoy the hell out of you. Of course it's at the start of the movie.In the first 20 minutes I almost fallen asleep, I closed my eyes a lot. Half the cinema was sighing and were watching the phone clocks. Which was kind of a... very negative.. feedback. I watched it later on the computer, if I let something out. For internet arguing. But.. this is just not an okay movie. Not even a 'meh'. It's bad.It's so bad, that the bully is basically a standard Arab guy - that they probably put in for diversity - who calls Peter a genital. A bully used to be a thing, and it used to be a muscular aggressive man, that hit and kicked Peter. A real bully. Realistic. Now.. it's just.. a guy.. It's very shameful.I really don't recommend it.",1,60,99,28 July 2017
Suicide Squad," Mixed feelings, Superhero genre
","The film is between brilliance and a giant disaster. Before you go to watch it, really think about whether you want to watch it.First of all: The Enjoyment. The first 30-40 minute is pure sleep. The character introductions are good, but the plot and explaining is BORING and horrible. A lot just gone out to get some snacks. The middle part is well-done, it pulls your tension and things go more serious, interesting. Characters really show off, the trailer Joker+Harley is here. The end is very good. I really enjoyed as things clipped together, BECAUSE of the characters. Not plot or anything else. The actors really carried this movie.The plot. The plot is non-existent, gibberish. You can see it in the first part that it barely makes sense and nothing gets together. At all. It's pure mistake. The middle part proves this a 100%. It's not going to make sense, it's stupid and the writer or producer really - really - wronged this.The characters. Awesome. Loved them all. They all performed a 120%. The main act is carried by Will Smith(dead shot) and Jay Hernandez(The Satan - IMDb text filter) whom out-performed themselves. They were really good. The sideline is strongly carried by Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn) and Jared Leto (Joker). The rest of the characters are without purpose. Their whole existence is a mistake in adaptation for either the animation or the comics. As such I can't say anything of whether are good or not, because they are just there. In comparison for the above, they don't have anything to do. Amanda Waller character (played by Viola Davis) was also really good.The cinematic. Awesome. The way the guys made this ~~ were really awesome. The scenes felt good, the slow-motion and lights brilliant. The cutting however was bad. The lightning also bad from time to time.I think as an adaptation.. this movie fails. As a standalone movie ~ okay.I would love it if they were to remake it with the SAME characters, so all the bad things would be worked out right away.",8,3,4,14 August 2016
Watchmen," A bit too much, too vague, too long
","The show has it's absolute pro's, such as some characters, like Roschack, Dr. Manhattan, The Nightguy. The setting is pretty good too. There are a lot of good things, hard to grasp, but it's there. The politics, the grim, the power, all of them fits pretty well. Than there is the philosophy.. and the story.I also feel, that some things are just.. bad, out of place. Especially the philosophy.
The thoughts, the ideas, which the movie is trying to imagine or screen are just bad. Sometimes childish. It feels forced, it feels long. Most of them could be summed up easily, and answered in the same way. It falls flat on the face.
It was so hard to watch through all the scenes and explanations that were put together like some childlike idea, which than was kept being pulled longer and longer.The story... well.. Not the best. The start and lead up was good.
An afterworld of the hero era with some remainders and political influence. Not realistic political influence or put together. More like a wash up. But okay.Than came the mid part and the end. The animation was good, but out of place and explaining way too much. I was happy to see it, but absolutely unnecessary in this form.
The whole Adrian thing is just bad at best. The whole Dr. Manhattan as the 'uniting enemy' is just stupid. It's.. faulty at every stage.
To put such a scrapped together ending to such a long and mixed together movie.. well.. a bit disappointing.So I would say the first hour is exciting, interesting, than downhill from then. 
I didn't like how there are gangs with Roschack around. It makes no sense. He is like a sociopath Batman. How are they even alive?
How he died was emotionally touching. I'm not sure if.. it was sound. But I really liked his character and the actor did a great job, his death was emotional.
I would say he was the max of the story.",7,0,1,9 June 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," This is how Spider-Man IS
","Whoever made this.. he/she understood what Spider-Man is.
The concept, the aspect.. on point.What a lot of Spider-Man movies lack is the soul of writting.
In this movie we could understand the will to do good, the duty, the soul, the humanity, and the fragility.Spider-Man is so confident, not because of birthright and not because he is good at humour, but because he is just a simple man. He makes the act to be confident, he does like he is not afraid. He acts like a hero, not because he feels like it, but because people around him need to feel it.His bravery comes from his fears and fragility. His strength is only a means to an end for a writter to get him where the villains are. So he could be where you could not get to. But when he is there? He isn't bulletproof. He isn't safe from weapons even as simple as knifes. He is just like you.
He grabs that opportunity and use it. Simply because that's the right thing to do.",10,0,1,23 April 2019
Captain America: Civil War," Forced, too soon.
","Both as a Normal Viewer and as a Marvel fan, I'm pretty underwhelmed.First of all, I think the movie is forced. Second of all, it's not well-made. Third of all, very unbaked, raw, too soon.1,) The movie tries to base on multiple characters, even on characters that haven't been properly introduced or feel like side characters, even though they pose as 'great marvel avengers'. Each of these characters should've got their own movie first, and than the Civil War. The movie feels like they try to say 'Yeah, look at him! He is important!' meanwhile you are like 'Who the hell is that?'. It feels forced.The confrontation, the characters, the plot, over-all it's just.. mixed but not forged. They are just there. I expected much more from a Marvel and from a Superhero movie. I feel like this movie is terrible and just hard to watch. Spider-Man feels like he is just there because he was in the trailer. So you need some hype and want to advertise the other new Marvel movie, so let's drop him in.2,) Most of the fight scenes felt bad. It's not just the lack of them, because in comparison to the Avengers, or the Hulk vs Iron Man of the Avengers II... what do we got? .. but also the quality and un-creativity of them. It feels like they didn't even try. Seriously, compare this movie to the rest of the Captain America and Avengers movie. Well worked out scenes, dynamic fights, show offs, jokes etc. They had so many things in them. Here..? Blank, uninteresting, mostly just camera shots. Simply: In Avengers 2 we could see why Warmachine is a war-machine. Gatling guns, rockets.. it's basically Iron-Man in a gunpowder version. Here? He is chasing a slower, gliding guy, who is basically un-armed in comparison to the Iron-Man armor. Than he gets 'accidentally' shot down by Vision... On the SKY. I know Vision has a range.. sure. But this precision, force and range? Why wasn't it used before? I would say that Vision is a very mixed character in this story, but let's just say that they tried to hide him.Pretty under-whelming to be honest.3,) I don't think they didn't notice this. Even on script these problems, plot-holes, and just overall they can be felt. But business is business and they went with it.. and you can feel that. A lot of choice in this movie is just not good. A lot of part is boring, the side-stories sometimes are stronger than the main story...F.e.: The video-footage. The whole movie based around it. So they had a camera like that, on the middle of nowhere in 1991? Well, not everything is perfect. Let's forget it. ..and another one.. and.. next one.. and another one. Did anyone thought the actual plot over? The let's hate each other for some unknown reason, because the viewers want to see you fight with each other. Yeah, beat each other up. I liked that fight scene though. I'm sure you will hear people rant, how Captain America who even as a super-soldier should not be able to fight with Iron Man, or that Buky just has an iron-hand not an iron chest, but this is a comics movie. It doesn't have to be perfect. However when you constantly feel that they didn't even try. 'Ohhh it will be good for fans, they watch everything.' The feeling is just flowing from the movie.I don't recommend it over-all, maybe if you are a hardcore fan.",3,9,19,1 December 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," As a movie, under-average.
","For those who want to watch this movie, pro-s and con-s.
Pro:
<ul><li>I think the actors did a great job. They show good feelings, they are not boring to watch, they do well.</li><li>The movie has a good comedy to it.</li><li>Some okay sci-fi movie to watch.</li><li>It has very good design, very good interiors, scenes, and brilliant effects.</li><li>I guess it's an okay Star Wars film for fans.</li></ul>Con:
<ul><li>The movie is boring. Not for me, but for my family of not fans.</li></ul>If you want to take the kids and the family to this.. unless they are fans, just don't.
Even as a Star Wars fan, there have been those moments of 'okay'.
<ul><li>The plot is horrible and badly written. The main line of happenings are so forcefully put together that not in a sci-fi, in Star Wars, or in a real-world logic can it stand it's way. You would not expect this low-quality from a Disney movie.</li><li>The side plots and happenings are even worse. All the great moments are ruined by a slap on the forehead. 'What was the writer thinking?'</li><li>The sci-fi elements are often horrible. The ships are just bad designs.</li><li>The space battles are an 'okay' at best. They are small, illogical, forced and alien to the genre.</li><li>The final acts are bad from every possible point of view. They are weak.</li></ul>They are a slap on the tummy type of bad.Fans:
<ul><li>If you had problems viewing the previous Star Wars movie, just download this one. It's much worse. As a fan, when I saw the Nebulon-C and that star fighters by cannon now can shoot and fly under shields... the middle part is around 3 m in diameter. A couple shots or a torpedo can destroy that and it's thinner than Nebulon-B.</li></ul>Over all I recommend watching / downloading this as it is a Star Wars movie.
But I can't say it will be a good experience.",3,0,0,17 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Every line is sewed, every thought is ended!
","I know a lot hates the Prequels, for a lot of reason. Some is as how they show the things we heard about in the Originals. They are entirely different, than what we imagined. This is what I like. That the episodes show how things escalated, and that how things turned so black & white.<ul><li>First of all, Darth Vader. We all heard of how good he was as a Jedi Knight. A great warrior, a great general and a Jedi. But especially this episode shows how untrue that is, and how it is mostly nostalgia from the old Jedi. He wasn't a good Jedi, he had a wife. Which lead him to the dark side.. which is why Jedi aren't allowed to marry in most cases. He was young, he was passionate, he was smart and powerful. But these are the things that lead him to the dark side. But when we hear of him, we imagine an epic young Jedi, very powerful, strong, mighty who was seduced by Palpatine. Which is again not true. Both Clone Wars, canon and this series shows, that the reason Darth Vader is a thing mostly faults at the Jedi and Anakin. I would say even Obi-Wan. He overlooked every dark thing, and he knew about Anakin and Padme. He knew that Anakin has problems because he was once a slave, but nobody done anything. They all ignored it. (Jedi Codex irony)</li></ul><ul><li>The Great Republic. We heard a lot of great things about it... but honestly, is it even livable? Would most choose to live under the Republic? Corouscant the core of the whole thing is filled with / rotten with - corruption, unlivable places for the poor, and a pretty bad place for the average citizen. Constant strikes, demonstrations. The CIS exists because of the Republic. Outter Rim people being looked down, colonized and used by the Republic. The only good way to make more money, and have a chance for a better future is trading, which the Republic very heavily / extensively taxed. The reason so many people rebelled. Of course, they are far from the good, but how desperate they could be? And what the council did? What the Jedi did? Nothing. Problems comes after problems, they didn't care and when they don't have enough money, because of corruption etc, than they tax even more? This is a thing in the real world, and it's not a good thing.</li></ul><ul><li>The Jedi Order. We heard so much of it. But.. it's nothing like what we heard. Not at all. They are basically ignorant politicians half the way, than 'blinded' by the dark side. Their acts is not at all smart. In the Clone Wars we are going to know even more about things and see how things escalate, but even here we can see all of it! So many fault, so many things the Jedi can't seem to notice. Are they really wise? Smart? No. Far from it. Political guards - shock trooper clones - everywhere in Coruscant. Remember the Separation of Powers? It was made, so no One man could hold the power, but it's there. They are everywhere. We will see more of how deep they are everywhere in CW, but just from this 3 movies we can see it. One man, Palpatine has all 3 line.. but the Jedi never noticed. How is that possible? Many great Jedi Master left the Order, because of these things, and they show it. The Jedi is bad, political, corrupt, not caring. They are doing what they are not supposed to!</li></ul><ul><li>The Clone War We expected epic battles with Jedi fighting and Clones being bad ass, and so many more thing! But this showed what the war really was. A massacre. A resistance for a well-needed change. The Jedi, basically a force-cult whom are barely military trained compared to clones were generals. Not knights or specially ranked. They were Generals in the war. How? The clones? They were people, but they were killed by the thousands. While the CIS had droid ships and barely any real people on board, every republic cruiser had thousands of clones and they all died. Some of the ships were supposed to land forces (invasion forces probably) and had as much as 16 000 clones on it, but was shot down on orbit! The clones were bred to fight, and had to fight. How is that humane? I understand, you have an army, let them fight we need them anyway. They were bred to be soldiers, and you can't do much about that. Even though it's clear that the enemy ordered the Clones and their hand is in this.. but sure let's use them. Is that smart at all? No, no it isn't. But make more of them? Sacrifice millions of clones that were never given the chance to not fight, because basically you are corrupt. These are not droids, they are people. They die, they get a hole in their stomach, they bleed out. This episode showed that.</li></ul>Summary: The Jedi is Evil ..and I recommend this movie.",9,30,35,14 December 2016
