Catch Me If You Can," Simply Captivating...
","Even if the acting, the screenplay and direction weren't excellent, this movie has the unique advantage of being based on an incredible true story. In no way was anything dramatized; and in fact some incidents were absent from this retelling of Frank W. Abangale Junior's (adolescent) lifestory.My only complaint about the movie is that it is slightly overlong (around 10 minutes - honestly!)Once again, Tom Hanks demonstrates his subtle genius and DiCaprio does a convincing job. The first prize must go to Walken though, as his portrayal of a broken man is touching without being sappy.All in all, a great movie that isn't spoiled by the usual Spielberg trappings.",9,1,2,3 January 2003
Minority Report," I didn't see it coming!
","While I marked down Vanilla Sky for its unprecedented use of subtlety to obfuscate what was really happening, I am glad to say that Spielberg has used the technique to better effect. I always judge a good movie for its lack of cliches, and as such I didn't see the climax until it actually happened. The final dilemma in the movie was excellent and once again we're treat to an unobvious action.So, what about the world of 2054? Well, it's nice that Spielberg had a bunch of eggheads brainstorm what the future might hold, but I have some trouble believing that so much will have changed in so little time. Obviously, the movie is set in the not-too-distant future so as to leave some link to the present. I do not think that Mag-Levs will be the order of the day. Indeed, Big Oil will still have a strangle-hold on central and state government.As for the acting... well Mr Cruise performed well within his usual parameters... though at the top end I'm glad to say. The fact that he did all his own stunts is nice as a completely obvious stunt-double always ruins it for me. But - I hear you say - it was all CGI, wannit?I enjoyed the movie on the whole even though it was a tad overlong.",8,0,0,11 July 2002
Shutter Island," Very Poor Effort
","I don't have much to say about this movie at all. I felt that the storytelling was amateurish at best. The scenes were hacked together in such a poor fashion, and the clues to the ending were so blatant. I worked out the premise of the movie about 8-15 minutes in. Sure, I wasn't absolutely certain at that point, but once I reached my conclusion the 'clues' came thicker, faster, and so blatant they were right in my face. After 30 minutes I had no further doubts that I'd nailed it. It's not so much that I'm so awesome at guessing movie plots, but more about how badly put together this story happens to be.Without giving too much away, the initial scene on the boat tipped me off right away that something was off. The scene were they arrive at the island contained some more heavy-handed clues. The dead giveaway though, was the way that later scenes did not fit together coherently. The second or third dream sequence lasted too long for a conventional depiction of a dream, and I felt that we were supposed to lose track of what was real and what was fantasy/dreaming.Overall, I was very disappointed following some rave reviews. This movie has been made before, and it's been made much better.",2,2,5,27 June 2010
Lost in Translation," Lost in the story...
","The thing that I liked most about Lost In Translation was the complete and utter absence of any formula whatsoever. There was no sex, no guns, no rape, pillaging, murdering or any of the violence that make 'blockbuster' 'must-see' movies.This is a whole different outing than Virgin Suicides was. It's a simple story, beautifully told, with great humor and style.Murray, probably improvising as usual, even affected the cast on occasion, with his novel wit. Johansson was utterly believable too, as the slightly homesick, bored young wife.As for the story; it was very simple and almost too easy to identify with the characters in some way.Coppola is fast proving herself to be some kind of genius. She brings together all the elements and it just works. Appropriate soundtrack, not in-yer-face but subtle, amazingly simple yet brilliant direction, an obvious talent for spot-on research (and especially impressive when we consider this is Tokyo-as near another planet as is available), and of course the perfect cast.But the real talent shows through when you realize that we are simply privvy to a few days in the lives of the actors. There are no life-affirming truths, no catharsis, no zenith. And yet the story is so compelling and yet so subtle. The problems that exist for the characters at the beginning remain after the end. Nothing is fixed.All in all, a top movie, possibly the movie of 2003. Now I just have to wait for Coppola's next amazing movie.",10,0,0,5 October 2003
Knowing," Dark, Spooky, and actually all right
","The movie 'Knowing' is a well-told, intriguing, and at times, spooky story. The acting is on-par with the modern cinematic experience. There is action, wonder, intensity, and a wonderful sense of foreboding throughout. I liked it and it kept my interest. I had a feeling where it was going, but I was enjoying the journey to get there. There was never a moment where I thought, 'Why is he doing that???' Nicolas Cage does what he's best at and it kinda works. The kids aren't too annoying.However, from some of the comments I have read here, I would have believed this to be yet another bad Hollywood (despite being filmed almost entirely in Melbourne, Australia) popcorn flick.phantasmagoric-1 from United Kingdom writes: '... aliens! The second worst cop out in history ...' How are aliens in any way a close second to, '... and then I awoke, and it was all a dream'? I don't understand why a movie cannot contain that particular story element? Who decided that it's off-limits? And when? (You do realize that Transformers are aliens, right?) Personally, I blame Steven Spielberg, Star Trek, Star Wars, and all those 50's science fiction movies. They really cornered the market, and paved the way for alien-free cinema.This, in spite of the fact that the whole movie had the premise seeded throughout. This comment suggests that the aliens just popped up at minute 120 of a 2-hour film, and proverbially saved the day.prezidanto from United States writes: 'I've been reading science fiction for 30 years.' Really? Well, I've been reading SF for 30 years too, and I've read many books with similar themes throughout those 30 years. There was nothing in this movie that validates this reviewer's comment, ''Thought-provoking' only in the sense that if you start thinking about it, you'll be astounded at how little sense in makes, and how much thinking you have to do to force any of it to work.' The movie made complete sense. Yes, there is some thinking involved. A good story compels us to do that.clement-reber from Switzerland writes that the movie is merely propaganda for Scientology. Well done genius. Now everyone's Googling the Scientology websites to find out where to sign up. Oh, hold on. They're not. Even if there is a Scientology angle to the film (and Hubbard did not invent the premise being told in this story... not even close), it doesn't work unless you put the phone number up on the screen, silly.valonpimeys from Finland wants to know how a girl in 1959 could write down GPS coordinates... that are from the future. It's hardly worth my time pointing out such ridiculous lack of understanding. That's aside from the fact that GPS coordinates are simply latitude and longitude - a system that is way older than the 50's.How about the one about the numbers, and how they're never explained. What? Never. Explained? Did some of you fall asleep? Did you turn your brains off, or were you texting on your phone through the whole movie?So, now I get down to my review of the reviewers. The simple question that I want answered is this: Does anyone actually know anything about the movies they go and see? Or do they just blindly walk into a cinema based on the scenes of fire and destruction they saw in the trailer. It's obvious to me that a good many of the people that saw this movie rated it based on some misguided notion that it didn't play out how they expected.Does anyone actually know how to be entertained these days? Not enough car chases and guns? It's my firm belief that people are getting stupider as time goes on, that unless a movie has a simple A-B-C plot then they don't know what's going on. Still more, in a tiresome attempt to relive the awe that followed their watching of 'The Sixth Sense' refuse to accept a story that doesn't have a 'twisty' ending. How many films with tiresome plot-twists do you need to see before you realize that there just aren't that many great ideas left in the world. M. Night Shyamalan has proved that to be true on more than one occasion.You're three quarters of the way through the movie, after every prediction comes to pass as written, and you still can't accept that John Koestler has no power to change anything. I mean, how dumb do you have to be to still be waiting for the big tangential plot-twist at that point. And did you wipe the constant appearance of the spooky aliens from your mind?Were the constant references to the sun not a big enough clue? Didn't you understand soon enough that this wasn't a horror movie? That the occult wasn't being featured here? prezidanto from United States makes my point quite aptly when he asks: 'How come the aliens can't find *some* way to communicate with people?' Well, big surprise for those of you who don't understand the obvious. They did. But, and here's the kick in the pants for you folks, even if they hadn't at all, or even if they'd phoned up the President himself, or appeared on the Today show with flashing neon underpants that spelled out 'The End Is Nigh', they couldn't stop the inevitable from happening. And that, my children, was the point of the whole movie.",9,2,5,9 July 2009
Wanted," Fun, suspension of belief movie, without pretensions of grandeur
","This movie is a non-pretentious thrill-ride. Jolie says little, and that's always a good thing. McAvoy plays the dweeb's transition to superhero assassin very well. He was convincing in both roles. Oh, and there's just enough silly improbability to clue you in that this movie isn't intended to be taken 'too serious'.Well, after reading some of the downers who reviewed this movie, I have to say, yet again, why do people watch movies that they likely won't enjoy? This is definitely a 'leave your brain at home' movie. Just pure fun and more than a little tongue-in-cheek. In many respects it shares something of what made 'Crank' a fun movie. There's no doubt that most of what is portrayed in this movie is downright impossible in the real world. I see similar reviews for 'Doomsday' and it makes my blood boil. Some people simply don't understand the film-makers' intentions and miss the point that it's just for fun.Basically, we're given the premise of an every day guy who has lost his way. His job is boring, his boss is simply awful. One day, he finds out that he's really the son of a superhuman assassin and his destiny is to fill his shoes. Sure, there's a little hokey philosophy thrown in to tie the story together, but it's just a MacGuffin when all's told. No need to enter into a socio-political, philosophical rant about fate, etc.If you've had your fill for the week of weighty, meaningful drama, or you're just a sucker for well choreographed, CGI-heavy action, then this is something for you. If, on the other hand, you believe that entertainment must only contain elements of fact and only reside in a world of what is possible, then stay at home, don't rent it, don't watch it, and don't whine on IMDb about the two hours of your life you'll never get back -- you still won't get 'em back.All in all, I enjoyed this for what it is. It didn't leave me with a message, and I didn't think about it afterward. But sometimes, that's what I'm looking for in my entertainment.",9,3,5,20 July 2009
8 Mile," Gritty!
","Waddya mean this movie is predictable? What's a blue-collar white rappin' guy gonna be doing that wasn't depicted here?Anyway, I thought that the movie showed a lot of guts in depicting the 'real America' and not the one where everyone lives in million-dollar houses in predominantly white suburbia. It showed a realistic depiction of  a blue-collar guy finding his own way. Sure some of the characters were a little on the 2-dimensional side but sometimes people are like that in life too.As for Mr Mathers performance; I'd like to announce that this is a fine start to a promising acting career. Many have tried before (Elvis, Whitney, Sting... ad nauseum) and failed. So, the script didn't exercise his acting ability too much but I believed in the character.Sure this isn't the 'true-to-life story of Marshall Mathers III' but it is analogous to some degree. The rap battles were particularly well photographed, directed and performed. The rhymes were awesome and hilarious and they showed Marshall's true talent.Look beyond the hype and I think you'll find a well-told tale.",Null,1,1,10 November 2002
Inception," What is the most resilient parasite?
","It could possibly be Leonardo DiCaprio. That's a bit harsh – I know he has to eat too – but does he have to always play the same sanctimonious, pedantic, self-righteous know-it-all? And he's been in some bad movies recently. 'Revolutionary Road' was a potentially good movie, but he always comes off as immature. 'Shutter Island' was so transparent that I guessed the ending about 10 minutes in. But, this is supposed to be about 'Inception'...Yes, 'Inception', a movie so simplistic that I yawned throughout. My (lucky) wife fell asleep claiming that it wasn't of interest to her. What claimed to be a smart, intelligent thriller, turned out to be the usual bag of guns, explosions, chases, etc. The plot, paper-thin and without any real point, is a yawn-fest of borrowed ideas and takes liberally from movies we've seen before. Is 10 years really soon enough to remake 'The Matrix' (with Ellen Page as Neo)? Dennis Quaid in 'Dreamscape' is far more entertaining. 'Videodrome' is way more complex and intriguing, a movie that makes the viewer work.While the acting is fair enough for an action flick, there isn't much to say about the movie at all. It's pretty 1-dimensional and quite dumb. What really irks me is the fact that I was told repeatedly about how this movie was so complex, complicated, hard to understand, etc. It's really not. It just uses a nonsensical plot device; that of layered dreaming, to try and outwit the audience. While completely ridiculous – isn't a dream within a dream just part of the same dream? – it's also not hard to grasp. Is the bar really that low? What would the audience that this bamboozled make of a movie like 'Primer' which is one of the most complex movies ever devised. Even 'Mission Impossible' had more plot twists and turns than this drivel.To be honest it was barely just okay. It was boring like a bus-ride through Nebraska. Your mind is the scene of the crime? I didn't see much of any crime - just some folks trying to get a guy to change his mind. Big deal. Michael Caine is even becoming a Director's Trademark. His two minutes on-screen were gratuitous at best, certainly not a requirement to the story.So, to wrap up: boring, simple-minded, dumb, nonsensical plot with no 'science' and barely any 'fiction', less-than-average acting, annoying constant music while people are talking, convenient 'get-outs' when the logic of the story fails, which is frequently. Wow, I actually think I hate this movie.",5,25,43,7 January 2011
WALL·E," #1 movie of 2008
","To the 1,000 or so people who 'hated this movie.' I'm sitting here reeling. In fact I'm utterly bemused. How can so many people take time out of their lives to give bad 'reviews' for a movie they haven't seen, simply because they got the impression somewhere that it is an ecological screed (which it really isn't)? Do they really think they can disguise their 1 star votes by claiming, 'I really loved the movie but I have to mark it down to level the playing field.' Who do they think they are kidding? If you don't like the idea of this movie being in the IMDb Top 250, then too bad. It deserves its place and was put there by the people who enjoyed this movie. I mean, please stop politicking, it's just a movie! I'm also wondering how on Earth adding dialog (between who is quite another question?) to the first 40 minutes of the movie would do anything other than to devalue the story. If you really need language to explain a story then too bad. Not that words are necessary as the story explains itself anyway. And if your 4/5/6/7/8-year old was bored throughout then you should perhaps question your parenting methods, or figure out beforehand which movies are the dumb ones you can see with car chases and 1-dimensional plots so no thinking is ever necessary. I'm sure you'll agree that there are plenty of films like that to satisfy your simple needs. While you're about it, why not get a map out and see for yourself how far from Hollywood Pixar's offices are. Emeryville is in Silicon Valley, a stone's throw away from San Francisco. That's a 7-hour drive from Los Angeles.I should point out at this juncture that I didn't want to see this. I thought it was going to be bland and silly; yet more terrible 'sci-fi'. I was so wrong...This movie is simply beautiful from start to end. I can't wait to see the opening scenes again, they simply took my breath away. The images, the music, the simple but brilliant story. All of it is worth every penny we spent to watch this. Our 6-year old daughter loved the movie, and laughed throughout. Even if the elements in of themselves are not stunningly original, it's the way that everything was sewn together so perfectly. I was blown away by Thomas Newman's amazing score, simply beautiful, not 'ugly' as the 'Roach Warning' lady (who never saw the movie either) described it.All in all, this is a great movie, and I will watch it again... two or three times perhaps. It deserves its placing in the Top 250 because it is that good.So, to counter all the 'take it from me, don't watch this' folks, please consider watching this masterpiece. And then vote for it and give it a rating it deserves. We can all continue to destroy the planet after the movie.Come Monday, I'll be recommending this to everyone I know. And they'll probably rate it highly too. Too bad for the 1,000 or so no-shows.",10,1,4,12 July 2008
Vanilla Sky," Cruise reprises Keanu's role..?
","While it took Keanu Reeves' character a short time to escape the Matrix... it takes Cruise the entire movie! Yes, it's the same idea retold cleverly... but...We have no idea what the heck is going on in this movie. The clues are so subtle as to be almost non-existent! Crowe said that he did this intentionally, but I belong to the 'other school of thought', and I like to have a fighting chance to enjoy the movie whilst it is happening. I can see what it's all about - it's striving to put us in the same confused situation as the central character. However, those clues were not working for me.Penelope Cruz... she has got to go! She has to be the most annoying person who ever thought she could act.Cruise did some nice over-acting, though I'm going to forgive him as the most obvious example ties in with a joke... and it made me laugh so that's okay.I now wish to see the original. Maybe Cruz isn't so annoying in her mother tongue...",8,0,0,11 July 2002
The Breakfast Club," The BEST John Hughes movie... the BEST 80's movie!
","I love John Hughes' work.  That I have to say to begin with... but when I learned that this movie was all set in ONE place I had serious misgivings. I just hoped it wouldn't be tediouos.  How wrong could I be..?  This is such an intense movie, that it has you on the edge of your seat throughout.  Not bad for a movie with almost NO action. Secondly, even as someone who grew up in Britain, I can still relate to these kids.  The moral I think is that everyone has their own problems whether rich or poor, successful or a failure... and the old adage that the grass is greener but that it really isn't is one aspect of this movie.Thirdly, the dialogue is excellent; the script is so awesome and never fails to deliver.  It is so true, so profound and very believeable.  There is little schmaltz and we are left wondering if there is a happy ending at all...Fourthly, the acting in this movie is of the best calibre considering the average age of the cast.  Emilio is par for his usual course, Ringwald is superb, Hall plays the subdued academic geek too well, but the real winners here are Nelson and Sheedy... especially the latter with her very convincing portrayal of a basket-case.This movie is in my Top Ten.  Watch it... tonight!",10,0,1,11 August 2000
