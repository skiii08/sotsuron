Come and See," Florya becoming a true man in the eyes of World War II
","Elem Klimov's film, 'Come and See' was an extraordinary realistic approach to the portrayal of the Soviet Union's struggle to survive during World War II. Klimov deserves all the recognition for creating one of the best honorable war movies of all time. Through his realistic stylistic attributes, the audience is able to fully indulge their six senses and develop a sensory overload that haunt your mind of the horrific events that will forever mark history. 'Are you crazy?!'-This is an amazing opening line of the film, that serves as an effective foreshadowing of what is to come. The intensity of 'Come and See' is efficient through the use of reaction shots that allow viewers to feel for the actors as if they are in a trance. By shooting the actors at a 'through the lens' glance, Kilmov is able to capture real humanistic expressions on their faces. Through these shots, the audience can unconditionally grasp an emotional awareness of what it could have been like to experience World War II for yourself. Also playing with your sense of smell, there is a scene in Florya's village where he returns only to find it has been completely wiped out by the Nazis. Florya and Glasha are sitting at the family table eating leftovers as flies infest the area. The elaborate buzzing of the flies leaves you cringing in your seat. The soundtrack and sound effects lead you through Florya's journey of survival while losing his home, family, hearing, and joining the Partisans. Through it all, he was able to redeem self-awareness and become a true man. Klimov's film is an intellectual montage. Consequently, the film is presented backwards putting focus on Florya's experience (the effect) first and then the dramatic closing scene of Florya shooting his rifle at a picture of Hitler (the cause). This way of montage allows you to fully focus on Floryas's ultimate challenge of finding a greater meaning and truth of life, without any glorifying aspects. In the beginning of this film, Florya is just a boy who dreams to become an honorable man. Through the film and through his experiences, does he actually come to terms with himself as a true soldier. In the end, you are now aware that Florya is a conscious man who isn't just fighting without cause. Now he is fully engaged and aware of Hitler's power and what it means to really fight in a traumatizing war.",9,1,1,8 February 2011
