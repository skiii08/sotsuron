Come and See," Not a good movie, worth to read. Very honest.
","I've seen a lot but this one..
I wasn't expecting anything. I'm just watching the top250 one by one.
So far every movie was good and rated them from 7 to 10.This one has nothing to do with reality. German soldiers did not behave like that.
In here german soldiers asked if they can help with the stuff that my grandmom's grandma carried! This happened in the maternal side.
On the paternal side my father's mother was raped by the soviet union's soldiers.So when I watched this movie. It started out ok. Then there was a scene where I had no idea if they cry or laugh. I had to watch that total nonsense scene for minutes. Then the bad bad germans came and the soviet union showed up as the good guys. It's not about who killed how many people in WW2. Just saying that the gulag was not different from the german camps! It's a soviet made propaganda movie, a lie. (And I'm not a german.)
I wonder if any country would make a movie about how bad are the US soldiers. How on Earth would that be in the top250.
If I don't care about the story then I have to say it is still a bad movie.Cinematography, directing, acting was awful.The sound and the design was ok. Nothing else.",4,4,17,16 October 2018
A Star Is Born," I wanted to not like it
","So I wanted to not like it but I LOVED IT.
I'm not into singing stuff but this one.I don't like Lady Gaga in overall, I don't like when a brand new movie shows up in the top250 but this one!Is a true 9. No doubt about that. It was about so many things.All I can say is this. Seen over 2k movies about 240 of the top250. This should be rated higher than it's current score.",9,0,3,26 November 2018
The Irishman," The best movie this year.
","Pesci should take home the Academy Award, but I would be fine with Al too.
It must take home the best picture and the directing. Like they should print it on the paper already. Nothing else going to come out that could match this one.
I'm only concerned about the lead actor. Phoenix delivered a good performance (even tho, I don't think Joker was worth the hype.)P.S.: Not the best Scorsese movie.",9,10,21,29 November 2019
BlacKkKlansman," 7.6? For real?
","I just watched this movie and I must say I know what it means when they write 'BASED'. It is not a true story. That's why it is based on it only.
Spike Lee is just not a good director.
He used characters that were totally needless..
He was focusing on things that were unimportant..
And I don't live in the US so we don't have any kind of problems like this at all.
But one thing for sure. This should have been serious. But it was a bad comedy. No more!I just don't understand how can anyone rate something like this higher than 6.
It was funny and interesting sometimes but it wasn't good at all.I hope it is not going to be nominated for any oscars with the black card.
In the last years there's been a movie that didn't deserve to be nominated but it was the best black movie that year so they nominated it.. Sick of it.",6,5,10,4 December 2018
Lost in Translation," Not good
","Well let's start with that I rate 98% of the movies similarly to what they have.
Like if a movie is an 8.5 here I'll rate it around 8 to 10. The 2% may end up receiving a 7 or worse. I do not give movies lower or higher rate just because I think those are over or underrated here. I'm fair. So far I've seen over 2k movies inclueding more than half of the top250.So this one was a bit boring but kept me interested. From the title I was expecting some kind of trouble made up by the fact they are both in a foreign country. Once it almost happened during a commercial shooting. But no. The terribly weak story just kept going. The only interesting story element was that the guy had a wife and kids. Nothing said that he is not happy with them. He just cheated them without any sing. That part was interesting. The woman's part is like nothing. I didn't feel or think anything about their realtionship. The only common was in between them that they were both in Tokyo and they said they couldn't sleep. No explanation here. I missed that. Then they teamed up got drunk once, were hanging out a little.. The movie ended and for some reason they had to kiss each other at the end. I did understand every minute of the movie. 
It was a movie with tons of plot holes, no real continuity between the character's acts. It was nothing. Sofia is not a good director. And an even worse writer.",5,1,8,26 August 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Good but
","Good but it had many faults and mistakes. 
Also I don't buy that we are going to be best friends after you burn down the half of my face or if someone throws me out of a window I would not forgive that.
If my kid attacks me with a knife I wouldn't act like that. Etc... 
Overally enjoyable that's why I gave it 7.I wouldn't give it a single Oscar for anything. Simly doesn't deserve it. There are many other movies that are not nominated for anything and are better in every aspect. ( Saying all this after about 2000 movies and with a good taste. )",7,2,4,20 February 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The best of the new movies (with a 6)
","I just liked it the most out of the new SW movies.
It was still a nonsense.. It was still a copy.. It has plot holes.. (Like SW movies made by Disney is the perfect definition of plot holes.)Everyone is a jedi now in these movies. Everyone knows about the force, everyone knows how to use it or atleast sense things with it.It wasn't in the first 6 movies.No random person was able to sense something just like that.
No relative of a jedi/sith was able to sense something, or use the force because his/her parents were an outstanding sith/jedi.
No jedi/sith was able to fly around.
No jedi/sith was able to throw a light saber around, keep it turned on and use it like that. (Otherwise there would be no reason to held it in your hands. You could just control it in the air and cut through everyone from safe..)
No jedi/sith was able to project theirs bodies on the other side of the universe.
No jedi/sith was able to collect power of dead people and become stronger. (That's a different movie!)The new movies basicly say that Yoda was a weak trash compared to any of these new characters. (I don't even mention that in The Mandalorian, Yoda's age which is 900 years at his death was no special. Because he ages differently, like a dog in reverse. In human years he was about 80-90 years old at his death.
Still the point was that he was so wise and powerful because he was hundreds of years old and through that time you could learn a few things. Also in that series his species just CAN use the force, just like in the new movies. No learning needed.)Still I gave it 6 as I enjoyed it the most. I did not enter the cinema to watch any of the new movies. And I'm also sad because of the fact that the majority of the people goes into the cinema to watch a trash like these movies.. Unreal.. Yet they haven't seen something like Casino, The Godfather OR which is even worse I've seen people here who gave 8 a f.. 8 to The Last Jedi! AND RATED THE CASINO with a 3!!!!!!!!! And it wasn't just one person. Most of these people seem to downrate classics that are just superior movies and uprate movies like this.And at last, The Last Jedi is still rated higher than the prequel trilogy. I haven't talked to a single person who said these are any better and still. There are more stupid people around.",6,4,8,2 January 2020
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Hm
","I had no great expectations at all. Let's start with that. I haven't seen a single picture of the movie, so I had no idea what I was going to watch.I've seen the great reviews of it, some stating that they were expecting something super overrated and it turned out to be the opposite.
So.Here I'm. Long story short, I accept the fact that the majority of the people who have seen this have low needs. That's why movies such as Roma for example generated only $3m at the box office. People in general need easy movies, don't have to think at all, more colours the better, some silly jokes and there you go.
That's why they don't make movies like the Fight Club today. Those kinda movies don't get the money to be made because people wouldn't watch them. Sick and might be hard to accept for some of you, but it's true. De Palma and many others states that people tasted Cola and now they only want to drink Cola.This movie was predictable. I didn't like the style of it, but it was ok. New, but not good. It had it's silly jokes, many nonsense things. TONS of PLOTHOLES.
Also it was easy. VERY EASY. If you have seen any Spider-Man movie, series or something, then you have already seen this movie. Literally.I was just waiting when comes that moment that will lift this movie up that would make it to deserve it's score. I was truly hopefully waiting until the ending. Every scene somehow just kept bringing more and more nonsense things into the way, not even caring about the rules of the movie itself. Then at the end we had a Clark Kent moment, when he puts his glasses on and nobody can recognize him and the movie ended.Visually wasn't good. Have seen far better visuals in an animated movie.
The best thing about the movie was the uncle's theme song. I liked that.Otherwise this movie is no different from the most of those that take place in the top250.Not even close to The Lion King, Your Name, Spirited Away, Grave of the Fireflies. Even Monster Inc. had more in it.It is currently no. 26 and with it the no1 animated movie. Which is funny because it had 1 Oscar nomination only. WALL-E had 6. Toy Story 3 was even nominated as best feature. Both of these movies and better by far.So, in my opinion this movie is just a great example of what people need today and how easy it is to impress them. It was far harder before.It is going to win it's award for the same reason. But it wouldn't even deserve to be nominated. Hollywood is full of people that don't know what a movie is or should be, they just take part of making one trash like this.",6,6,13,23 February 2019
The Usual Suspects," disappointing
","I've seen a lot of movies. Let's start with this.I gave it only a 6 as I wasn't surprised at all. 
When you are watching a movie where they want you to guess who's it, you know that already it is someone who's on the screen. A main character. When I was targeted first who's is Kaiser I was about 80% sure it is Kevin. As the movie progressed I was even more sure about it. 
Then it turned out it was Kevin. 
So it was a huge and very big disappointment for me.. It is on the list of 'the biggest twists' and I was expecting a twist but it didn't come. It was not twisted at all. 
Beside that it was a kinda boring movie. I was waiting only for the promised twisted ending.. The story was basicly nothing, it was built up for the twist. The acting was ok. Didn't like the cinematography and the editing. The music was sometimes good tho. Does not deserve more than 6.
The most overrated movie I've seen so far.",6,3,6,30 June 2018
Avengers: Endgame," madly overrated
","Come on people.
Why is every Marvel movie so overrated?
I rate them as what they deserve. Infinity War was pretty much the only outstanding movie in the franchise. They did something what noone dared before. That was a very good movie.This one? 7 at best. How on Earth can anyone just a little bit of brain rate this higher over movies Inception, Matrix, Goodfellas, etc almost the whole top250 movies. Are you mad? For real..This one was full of nonsense. They basicly setup something that shows and tells you who's how strong. When they show in the end of Infinity War that Thor now can beat Thanos easily, then how comes that he still has all the power but Thanos now can rip him apart without a single stone.Glad it is finally ended. Sick of seeing every trash being in the top250 because of little fan boys that haven't even seen sh**.",7,12,22,4 May 2019
The Princess Bride," IMDB should do something about it..
","Well first of all I've seen like 95% of the top 250.So I just watched this movie and it was an easy one. I just turned off my brain. I just had to watch it. Otherwise it was silly in a positive way and fun, but to be honest this movie had nothing in it. It was basicly weak in every aspect.The story was nothing. The only special thing was that it was told as a tale.It was really nothing.. I had no idea why is this movie rated 8.1 currently. Why is it a top250 'member'.Then I checked the reviews and I still didn't understand what the hell are these people talking about.Then I check 5 of them that gave 10 stars!When I saw that they gave movies like Casablanca, The Godfather, Metropolis, M, Rear Window, The LOTR movies, The Notebook, Rebecca and the list goes on.. So they gave these movies 3, 4 and 5 stars..
I just realized it is not me. Something is seriously wrong about them.
Someone who can give 4 stars for those movies above should not be allowed to vote. They are not reliable at all.
I tend to hate movies about drug addiction as I can't understand the motivation behind it. ( With a few exception ). But I do not rate it with 3 stars just because of that.
But seriously.. How can you rate The Godfather and Casablanca to 3 or 4 and give this movie a 10.. Incredible..",5,8,21,8 November 2018
The Favourite," Not a review
","It is really not a review. Just a question maybe.
Why do people watch this movie when they literally know they'll not like it?
Since directors can't make their own movies like they did before, we know that people want to see sequels and watch the same thing over and over.Those that go to the cinema to see something with Dwayne are hate this movie.
Those people would rate almost every movie from the top250 with a 1 because they too much used to see trash only. I understand it.
But why do you go to see a movie like this and then come here and rate it with a 1? Really.Imdb needs a change. It should not even allow to count the votes from people under 1000 votes. Sick of it.Otherwise, I loved the movie until the very end. Felt like Barry Lyndon a little.
Too much fish eye. I liked it, it was fitting in same cases, it was new and good use of it, but it was too much. Low light shots could have been better but I'm not here to teach that cinematographer. (He did a bad job for sure, along with the director. Again, Barry Lyndon. They could have easily achieve the same.)Overall, it was all good until the very end.I liked The lobster more. I was shocked back then it didn't receive anything except one nomination.But I can say that it should have win original screenplay for sure and the director category. Cuaron did great, but this one is better and more challenging.",7,1,3,17 March 2019
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Did I really watch the same movie?
","I mean for real. The story is nothing. Even if I would try hard to write something like this I couldn't. This is just shallow. I've seen thousands of movies. There is no genre I don't like. I've seen several top lists. I'm stating this to make you understand I have more experience to decide.So. I liked how it started out. I think it started to go down when the first 'fight' happened. I just hated those fights. Those literally looked amateur. In every aspect and I did not even mention the basic rules of those fights.
If there would be an explanation how they achieve to literally fly and do all those things. I would be ok with it. In every movie you see, you literally see that how they can do things. It is part of the character arc. In every movie! This somehow said that there is a book with pictures and a language and that's all. I just don't buy it. Atleast a 30 secs long scene where someone reads the book and tries out the technique and we see how that person starts to rise from the ground. Totally fine! Sold. Really. That's simple. That director is not a good one.My other huge problem was the point of the movie. It had a main line and one supporting. The main was a cliche. Poor woman doesn't want to get married. She wants to live her life no matter what.
The other one was a childish one. They didn't dare to say out loud or give signs of interest to the other. This happened to me when I was a 10 year old kid maybe.My last word is that it is VERY overrated.",6,1,9,9 April 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," What's up with those 10s????
","I mean for real. This is nowhere near as good as the previous Tarantino movies.
80% of it was all about he likes western. Literally.
Brad and Leo do their job, indeed and the whole thing ends there.I pretty much like everyone Tarantino movie, but I do not consider him as a great director. He uses violence well, everyone expects only that from his movies and that's all.This little tribute to western movie is not giving us that.Up to date this is the worst Tarantino movie. The story should have focus on the actual things that happened that time. Instead of that we have to watch an actor who played in westerns which is not leading anywhere. With a little Tarantino because he expressed through Leo how he feels.Those that giving 10s for this movie should not be using imdb.
You're giving subjective reviews as you like Tarantino so much even when he doesn't do well, you still admire him.As he states always one can do only 10 movies. As I count he reached that number already. This explains this movie pretty well.",6,3,7,9 September 2019
Get Out," Oscar for this? Really?
","It was enjoyable. It is a horror and a comedy too.
Most importantly it was bizarre! I mean when you imagine yourself in the same situation and you can think see through the whole thing while the main actor can't.. Then it's wrong. The only reason this movie got Oscar nominations because is because the main actor is black and the director is black. That's all. They don't deserve it by any means. It is a comedy where cops don't give a d**n about a missing person and they laugh at you. Where a cop can't talk seriously. Also if you walk on the street and someone is looking at you from the other side you can somehow just feel and you will turn there, this happens all the time with every single person on Earth. 
There are like 30 and the main actor doesn't notice anything beside that the black fellas are acting weirdly. What? I would rather give Oscar for Paranormal Activity than this in the same genre.",5,1,3,24 January 2018
1917," Calm down!
","The story is nothing. Everything was made to make the movie look like it was one shot. So because of this everything else was sacreficed. Sadly..But the point is that, why on Earth do you think the DP has anything to do with this?????? The cinematography was nothing. A guy was following the actors and that's all. There was one shot that looked amazing. The rest was nothing.What you saw, how they recorded the whole thing was made by the director. It's not cinematography. You're terribly mistaken.The cinematography is (in very basics), the angles, the way the camera moves (I said basics!). None of it was special at any point of the movie!Making it look like it was one shot was done by the director and not the DP.The director deserves an Oscar for making this movie. No doubt about that.
BUT the movies and it's creators deserve no awards.Every other nominated movie ever in this theme was better in every aspect!
Almost every nominated movie is better than this one.Just because you can't see, it doesn't make it better.",7,0,1,1 February 2020
Midsommar," Surreal, slow and what?
","I'm gonna start with something from it's trivia.
'Despite sharing the same title and both being horror movies set in Sweden, this film is not related to the Danish cult classic Midsommar (2003). 'So the ORIGINAL says 'Christian's sister commits suicide. Why? After his 4 friends graduate secondary school, they head off to a Swedish cabin for midsummer as previous years. Strange things happen.'NOT RELATED? SERIOUSLY? Even the guy's name is the same.About the movie.I didn't like a few shots, the camera was simply in a wrong place.
Many scenes were too long for no reason. I could easily cut out 30 minutes and it would flow better.The main character was not the main character. She was just a pretty object used to show us a very surreal world. Her character started out good but in the second act she was put away and there was no character arc anymore. After the second act because of it, it felt very odd that she kills off her bf.So her character was very badly written. It was used well, I liked the movie, but I felt sorry for her. She is the 'main' and all she had to do is go here, go there, 'cry' a little and smile..In my opinion the movie fails at the end because of the badly written characters. The movie and the shots show that she goes crazy but that happens out of nowhere, for no real reason.It was very surreal and this is why it is good. In every other way I think it's not a good movie. The director should see a doctor. For real.",7,1,4,24 October 2019
Life Is Beautiful," 6/10
","Liked the first half of it.
I didn't know what I was going to watch.
Downsizing and this movie has a problem in common. 
Downsizing failed because it started out serious then it went into a comedy.This one started out as a comedy and it kept being funny even in a death camp which is a pretty serious thing.
Which it seems by the reviews only a problem for me.
Not realistic at all by any means. Not even the time spacing is realistic..Utterly overrated.( Seen over 2000 movies, about 180 of the top250, I gave them about their imdb score. I love movies like Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Star Wars, every work of Hitchcock and Kubrick, Nolan movies, etc.. I can enjoy every genre, I have a great taste. That's the reason when I'm saying this is overrated you should atleast just think about it.)",6,0,4,27 July 2018
Joker," Not Joker!
","It was very good, but I think it should have been made out of the Batman universe. And so as that, I don't consider this performance and movie to be about Joker. Fleck is an original character and can not be called as Joker even if the creators of this movie want to do so, as Joker is not someone like in this movie.",7,0,12,28 October 2019
Parasite," Probably the first proper review..
","Let's start with that I've seen a lot. It's all public.
In the most cases meta's score given to a movie shows a better rating, a more realistic one compared to imdb.I've seen 1917, I was sick of that people don't even know what cinematography is.
The whole movie was made like 'Rope' except that Rope had an amazingly interesting story. 1917 had nothing in it. Paths of Glory was in many terms a lot more realistic. Long story short, I didn't like 1917 at all. I had no idea why it was even nominated.Then I saw the Marriage Story. As soon as I realised Adam Driver is in it (Star Wars guy), I just wanted to not like the movie because I don't like the new SW movies at all. Then it turned out it was amazing. He was very good, the movie was very good. I liked The Irishman too but the Marriage Story was superior.Then came the awards and Parasite won. I saw it has a score of 8.6 and I know the director. He did a crime movie which I liked (Memories of a Murder). That one was very good.So I just watched Parasite too.It was interesting, but maybe I've seen too many actually good movies, so I do not blow my mind just like that.The characters were ok and maybe that's all. The story was just interesting. There was nothing special about it. It was an original story, but it won't make it good. It has nothing to tell us. It's pretty much like a half written mess.
If somebody works for me for years, I won't fire him/her just because a tale someone told me. I would atleast question the worker. Atleast! At this point the movie was very unrealistic.The smell factor. We can't smell it :) But all that food as whiskey on that table has a strong smell. You can clearly see under the table. I just had no idea how is that realistic.. They were all given good wages and still they didn't take a shower or anything like that. They did all smell bad.. Sooo unrealistic and because of it the father's motivation made absolute no sense. No sense at all. Especially in that situation.It felt like they had to end the story somehow and they chose this way for some reason.Other factors of the movie are no special neither.Roma stands on 7.7 and is by far better in every aspect.Currently I've rated over 2500 movies, I write scripts, I'm working on to direct one of my works myself and I have to tell you that this movie was just OK and I have really no idea why would anyone give it a score of 8 or higher. If I would write and direct a movie like this, I would be not satisfied. Not at all.
For me it was 6.5 as it was interesting. Also it's genre is drama/thriller. There was not a single second in the movie that was comedic!",6,2,3,30 March 2020
Mother!," disgusting
","Check out my ratings. Almost 1800 movies. All with a fair scoring!'If we want something new at the movies,' he said, 'you give them something new' and they say, 'What the hell is that?'That's what Aronofsky said. I'm currently working on my own script(s) and I'll start off with a low budget feature that I'm going to make with my own money. My script has a very original twist that is easy to notice, to understand and it's also simple but it will f.. your head up. Especially if you remember the firt scene of the movie. I just had to think about it for a day. It's all original, not a movie or book has such a twist. I liked Aronofsky's works. Black Swan is a true 10 movie for me. But mother is not something new. It's a series of pointles acts that are just coming and making no sense. Beside this and beside that every character acts like they are crazy the movie doesn't even care about time! The ending of the movie or any other scene did not explain anything. All along the morbid humor and the pointles violence tried to keep up my interest but it massively failed. Aronofsky is massively failed. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. If Aronofsky thinks this is something new and it's good he should see a doctor. If you think it was good you should also see a doctor.p.s.: don't make reviews where you try to explain what happened in the movie while you gave it 10 star. google it and Aronofsky says it all.",1,19,30,21 October 2017
