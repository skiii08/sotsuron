The Incredible Hulk," Entertaining, but not up to Marvel's new standard
","It is undeniable that Marvel has been on a winning roll lately since it has become it's own independent studio. They have started from scratch to make their films more enjoyable to all audiences. With Ironman, the proof is in the pudding and most can agree that the movie was pure fun and a great film to boot.With our boy Hulk, I think Marvel missed the mark a bit, but luckily when Marvel misses, its not such a bad thing. The movie was entertaining and had my eyes glued to the screen during the sneak peak. The effects were dazzling, only looking cartoonish for a couple scenes. The Hulk is more human than in the Ang Lee version and it adds a nice element to the movie. Unfortunately, I could not get past Liv Tyler's horrible exchanges with Ed Norton and William Hurt. It was like watching a 7 year old pitch to Babe Ruth. She just can't at, and as an integral part of the movie, it strained me (and viewers around me). The saving grace is that mot people aren't going to see this movie for the acting, but Ironman set a new standard for acting(though Spider-Man has good acting) in recent comic book movies and Batman has followed the trend too. The dialogue was border line ridiculous, and the one liners that worked so well in Ironman did not in Hulk.Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie and it was an excellent summer popcorn flick, but as I said earlier, These newer comic films all feature more serious tones and more serious acting from more serious actors. No more Alicia Silverstone and George Clooney as our heroes, so why should we settle for Liv Tyler. Liv has roles that make her shine, this was not one of them. Norton and Hurt shine in every way they can, but the script was weak.See this movie, it will blow you away stylistically, but even the less nit-picky people will laugh at the bad lines.",6,8,19,11 June 2008
