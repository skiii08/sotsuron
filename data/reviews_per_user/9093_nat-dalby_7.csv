The Lobster," Darkly funny and really original
",The Lobster is slyly funny and surprisingly dark - there were a few moments that left me reeling which I did not expect going in. It will probably be too 'slow' for a few people but I think this is deliberate; the film uses repetition in a really interesting way to hit home the banality of the world. It's also beautifully shot and manages to be a stunning looking film despite the images being largely static - it reminded me of The Shining for this reason.,7,0,3,23 April 2018
Blade Runner 2049," Stunning sci-fi
","An incredible looking, sonic experience. I feel bad for anyone who didn't get to see this in the cinema. Plot-wise, it does a good job of expanding on the original premise whilst adding new elements and does what any great sequel does - have the events of the previous film inform the film rather than completely ignoring them. Blade Runner 2049 essentially acts as a sci-fi noir in much the same way as the original but is much more of a detective story. We see Ryan Gosling's character really investigating the mystery, which is an improvement over the original's kind of thin plot. It's a shame that brilliant and original sci-fi such as this doesn't make money anymore, but Blade Runner 2019 is such a treat for fans of the genre that it makes it worthwhile that it only comes once in a blue moon.",8,2,6,16 April 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," A rare original-feeling film from Marvel
","Quite comfortably one of the best Marvel films, mainly because it doesn't take itself too seriously at all. One of the best things Marvel has done to its films is hire directors with strong styles like Shane Black, James Gunn and Taika Waititi that let the films actually have some personality. Thor: Ragnarok looks incredible, has a neat synthy soundtrack and is packed with jokes. Only gripes I would have is that the main villain is a little under-baked considering she's supposed to be Thor's actual sister, with most of the film not focused on what she's doing. I also wish they'd kept the Hulk a secret, because it comes out of absolutely nowhere and would have been an insane surprise if he hadn't been on the poster.",8,2,4,16 April 2018
Molly's Game," Classic Sorkin script but no directorial flair
","Slightly disappointing - proof that Sorkin needs a decent director to elevate his scripts. Jessica Chastain lifts the film with a very good performance, though this is slightly marred by the awkward and clumsy dad character and her relationship with him - that scene on the park bench near the end where they basically explain the theme of the film to you, yeesh.",6,1,2,16 April 2018
The Beach," Average - not one of Boyle's best
",It's just ok. Not terrible by any stretch of the imagination but no masterpiece either. DiCaprio is as strong as ever (and manages to look younger than he does in Titanic despite it being 3 years after) and the classic Danny Boyle trippyness makes its way through. The upbeat ending clashes with the rest of the film and in general it's rather tonally confused.,5,1,1,16 April 2018
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Can't balance kid and adult stuff
","I wanted to like this way more than I did as I love Wes Anderson. The animation is beautiful but the dialogue is so smug and annoying it makes it hard to get into. The original story is charming enough without references to stuff that kids don't understand. Kids won't get anything out of the film at all, which is silly as it's based on a kids book.",4,1,3,16 April 2018
Annihilation," Thoughtful sci-fi that's all too rare nowadays
","One of the best sci-fi films in recent memory and it does not deserve to languish on Netflix. Annihilation does what too few films do - it's genuinely mysterious and more importantly ALIEN. Far too many films of this kind try to explain what the threat is in a way that kills the tension, but Garland gets that things are scarier when they're unknown. This makes Annihilation much more of a horror film than it advertises itself as because it bombards you with things you cannot possibly explain (all I'll say is...that bear).Visually Annihilation is also a treat, offering sights that are insanely original and creature designs that remind you of the weirdness of The Thing and Alien.Do not read up about this film before you go in. Just watch it.",9,2,5,16 April 2018
