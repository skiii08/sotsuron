Ford v Ferrari," Yes! What a great cine biography
","I've been saying this for years, but making a cine biography isn't easy. I know movies aren't an exact science, but most of the time I watch a biography, I found myself giving something around 7, when it's just an ok movie, or even lower. However, lately there were quite a few great ones, like 'I, Tonya' or 'Darkest Hour'. And man, this movie is definitely one of those great ones.The most fascinating aspect for me is that the movie is thrilling, it puts you on the edge of your sit for the entirety of it, the racing scenes are incredible, and it was truly a pleasure watching it without knowing Ken Miles' storyline, I was surprise a bunch of times. That's me though, I bet that most people would at least search a bit before watching the movie.Anyways, the movie has great cinematography, amazing performances by Damon and Bale. Also a shout out to Josh Lucas, he did great as well here, I hated him for most of the movie, and that was definitely the goal here.The score is good too. The movie is 2h30 hours long, but it never feels like it, you are so damn entertained by the thing, that when is ending you actually feel like you could watch another hour of it in a heartbeat.To sum up, James Mangold once again does a great job in his new movie, and he definitely has my attention now. Ford v Ferrari is a great movie for movie lovers but also for the casual moviegoer, who can simply watch for the sake of watching the racing sequences, at the end of the day, no one will be disappointed.",10,3,4,29 January 2020
Blade Runner 2049," Gorgeous
","WOW! I really don't know where to start here. This movie is stunning, an instantaneous classic. It's one of those films, that you really need to push yourself to find something 'bad', or even 'not good'.The photography/cinematography of this movie is one of the most gorgeous that I ever see. Almost every frame here is amazing, beautiful, poetic. The scenario, the look, the production design, really, everything is fantastic. In my opinion, this is a movie that everyone who love cinema have to see. I was blown away through every minute of it.The soundtrack (as usual when you talk about Hans Zimmer's scores) is very raw and loud, alternating with some quite and calm moments, and, my God! It works wonderfully. I love the score, it's unique, simple, and powerful.Ryan Gosling's performance it's fantastic, in fact, 'K' is probably one of my favorite character in recent films, he has so many layers, such a unique conflict (I LOVE everything on this part of the movie. He is such a broken character, just trying to find his place in the world, and OMG, his story through the movie is brilliant, and surprising), and a lot those things are amplified with Ryan's performance. It's powerful, engaging, and unique. In my point of view, he is doing a better job here than in La La Land.The last thing is the script, the story that the movie tells is at first odd, because at the end of it, you may think 'well, what about Wallace? The rebelion? What happens now?', but, the movie is in fact just a story inside this big and dystopian futuristic world (like the original Blade Runner also was), at the end, this is the story that the movie wants to tell, the journey of K, trying to find his place in the world, but, at the end, realizing that maybe he doesn't have one as he thought he would have, he is not special, in fact, he is probably much fucked than the other replicants (he has real memories inside his head, and this isn't legal), this is sad, but at the same time also makes you sympathize more with the character, I simply love K.The movie also approach a lot of deep themes, that clearly are reflections of our own world. Do the replicants have rights? Is it right to do they in order to be slaves? Can they live a happy life? These are all very deep and complex questions, that add to the movie even more layers. The 'what is real?' question that goes on and on throught the entire movie is also something that I love, and there also is in the original Blade Runner.In short, to me Blade Runner 2049 is pure art, an amazing film, that doesn't try to build a big, and new franchise from it, doesn't want to open a new world, and be something that everyone can see, and enjoy, in other words, he doesn't try to please everyone, it's a movie for film lovers that I think that everyone that loves cinema needs to see. It's one of the most beautiful, and well made movies that I ever see.",10,1,5,9 January 2018
Vertigo," Great
","The movie is great. However, the subtle messages aside, I didn't buy their love, and I didn't think they had chemistry at all, Johnny and Midge had way more chemistry. I get it tho, that Hitchcock was trying to show a man that chooses based on his understanding of 'perfection', and because he barely knows Madeline/Judy tbh, he falls in love for her lack of flaws, in contrast with Midge's evident flaws and weaknesses. I also think the whole plot of his relationship with Midge stays so unsolved, she just disappears at some point and never comes back.The scene she shows him the picture is so strange tho lol.I know the movie can mean many things, to many people, However, one of the meanings I think it could have is that it truly tells a story about love, loving the 'wrong' woman for only her outside, and still, making the same mistake again. That been Scottie 'losing' Madeline twice in the movie, almost in the same way (at least, in the same context).The acting is good in the movie. I thought Barbara Bel Geddes was so great! Every time she was on screen it was delightful, and I wanted to see her more. That's one of the reasons why I was upset her story sort of didn't have an ending.James Stewart is good in the movie, I thought he did good most of the time. And I think Kim Novak is fine, I don't know, I think one of the major reasons why I didn't buy the romance, was because of her performance, even the kiss scenes look weird. She isn't bad, she is just not my favorite performance in the movie.At the end, did she really die tho? I've noticed a shadow when the camera fades way, idk if that is just the camera's shadow, or if it could mean something else.The text was basically just bullet point, I didn't try to do a cohesive thing lol.",8,0,0,16 April 2020
Mission: Impossible III," A rush and raw adrenaline-full movie
","My god! This movie is good. MI3 is just a class about how to make a good action thriller movie, this thing is just breathless all the way down, you can't take a break, you're tense through the majority of the scenes.So many amazing moments, like the parkour scene in Xangai, the jump from the building, the interrogation scene (both of them), etc etc etc. This movie clearly build all the path that the franchise would follow for the years to come. It's not a 'trash' vibe of movie, it take itself seriously, but in order to do that, it makes you feel worried about the characters.It's amazing to see how JJ started with the right foot on his first movie. Probably the only little thing that bothered me was the close ups, is not a awful thing or anything, but I think that sometimes the screen can be too 'crowded' with the excess of close ups.Philip Seymour Hoffman destroys as the villain, his character is so threatening even though you don't know anything about him. The interrogatory scene in the plane is fantastic, when you realize that they gave him the only thing that he needed (Ethan's name). Amazing.Tom Cruise again kills it, the dude is a monster, and continues to impress everybody with his stunts. This is also the first of the MI movies that he needs to use some of his 'dramatic skills', and he delivers. The script is well writing, the twist of 'who is the inside bad guy?' really take me by surprise, and I love it. I also love the first minutes of the movie, when you see Ethan's party, it's soo well done, because in a fell different ordinary situations you get almost all that you need to know about Ethan, how is his life, how is his relationship, and that kind of stuff, in something that last like 5 minutes.In short, MI3 is a fantastic action movie, that with absolutely certain took the franchise to a whole other level.",9,1,1,11 February 2018
A Star Is Born," I'll definitely receive a lot of 'thumbs down' for it, but let's do this...
","Yeah, you saw my grading, and it's probably thinking 'wtf, dude?'. I don't know how so many people like this movie (it's apparently almost a consensus, I think, but we'll, I didn't, and I'll try explain why).The main problem, for me, it's that the movie is confusing, not in the sense that it is too complicated for you to understand, but actually in the sense of there are some many things happening at the same time, that you get lost. For example, the beginning of the it. I was impressed with how many things happen in the first 20/25 minutes of movie. She is in a pilot suit (?). Then she apparently works in a kitchen...? (They never explain that). Then she is singing in a drag bar. They come out. She punches a cop. They go to the market to buy freeze food (why don't you buy ice...? Since you are in the supermarket...). They SING in the parking lot. All of that in 20 minutes.But this is just an example. Don't get me wrong, I love most of the songs (c'mon, Gaga is amazingly talented, she is awesome), the acting is good. The cinematography is... ok?. But the story its self, I mean, she didn't have nothing to overcome thought the movie, they talk about her nose (?) but this is never an issue. She also says at some point that she doesn't want to be change by fame, but its ok with painting her hair orange...? And again, they never come back to this point again, she just changes and that's it. Even the dancers scene, after that show, she starts to use the dancers, and... that's it. Zero conflict.Also at the end. The producers it's kinda of responsible for her husband's death, but... Yeah, apparently nobody will ever now that, and confronts him about it.I love Sam Elliot, he is amazing, a legend, but I don't get all the buss here. Really, he does those type of things in The Ranch. Literally, his character in The Ranch, has some emotional scenes, that are as emotional as his scenes here are. What again, don't get me wrong, they ARE good, but it's not something he hasn't done before.Another scene, that to me sums up a lot of what is wrong with the movie: Their 'fight' in the bathroom. I mean. Wtf was going on there...? WHY do they fight?! There is literally no reason, and leads to nowhere. Cause in the next scene they are fine again.Anyways, to wrap up, A Star is Born, for me, it's a movie with a great cast and soundtrack, but that brings a story without depth, that at the end, just seems like a bunch of scenes cut together with much of a narrative objective. Definitely not worthy of the best picture nomination.",4,2,4,21 February 2019
Wind River," A hell of a movie!
","I really don't know where to start here, this movie is excelent!I already saw a bunch of people saiyng a lot of good stuff about this movie, and really, yes, is all that good. The story here is so thrilling, dense, and well writing that in a way, you fell like if you're there when happened. All the mistery around the death of this young woman is fantastic, it delivers to you in such a flow way. The same thing also happens with Jeremy Renner's character, we learn his pass through the movie, and when all connects in some point, is just truly emotional.All the actors here are amazing, Elizabeth Olsen, Jeremy Renner, Gil Birmingham (from Hell or High Water, another great movie), the lines are emotional and impactful, and this make their jobs a lot easier, but still, what a great thing to see!The soundtrack nail it too, all the musics help to build the tension of the scene in such a amazing way. In fact, I think that my only issue with the movie is in one scene at the middle of the film, where two characters are talking, and for no reason at all, the camera just shakes through the entire scene. I don't if was a attempt to pass some message using the camera or something (because in some other parts in the movie, we see some different use of camera too, but there, makes sense). But this is like an 2 minute long scene, you problably not even notice.In short, Wind River is a fantastic movie, full of great performances, with a beautifull photography, a smart script, and some truly tense action scenes! I just loved it!9,5/10",9,2,5,31 December 2017
The Big Lebowski," Well... you konw... this is just... like... your opinion man
","It's hard for me to see a movie, and say that it's an 10/10 movie, I don't, to me when a movie is 10/10 you're saying that this movie is one of your favorites of all time. And, ok, even though I've only seen it once, The Big Lebowski is one of the best movies that I ever saw.So, let's talk, the acting here is fantastic, everyone is great, the characters have this weird charisma, it's hard to explain but you simply care about all of them. The script is super well done, really, for me, the Cohen brothers and Tarantino are the best 'ordinary-dialogues-writers' out there, is just fantastic how cool every single one of those lines are funny, or meaningful somehow.And I think that my favorite thing about the movie is this, it's super funny, I laugh my ass of through the entire movie, but is also one of those films that you can watch again, and every single time it is going to have a different meaning. It's like a 'thing' of the Cohen brothers I guess, this is the same with Hail, Caesar! and (of course) No Country for old men. Is just fantastic those types of film, because isn't a movie that you need to see and pay attention to the details, an ordinary guy that just one to see one funny movie can watch this, and just have fun, but some crazy cinema fan (like us) can rewatch, and catch all the hidden things.The soundtrack is terrific too. In short, The Big Lebowski is a classic, one of the funniest movies I ever see, definitely worth your time.",10,1,3,17 January 2018
Darkest Hour," A surprisely above the average 'biography' film
","Ok, I know that this is not exactly an biography movie, but you know, it's the history of a short lifetime period of a real guy, who did great things, so it's in a way, a biography.And, once again (like we get with Battle of Sexes) we have some really above the average biography here. I think that do a biography movie is something really tough to do, so not every director can, but here, Joe Wright does a great job.The movie is very good, the approach of Churchill's life, and how the world simply fell on his shoulders in like two weeks is fantastic. It's also amazing to see, how 'weirdly' this movie and Dunkirk in a way complete each other, every time they talked about Dunkirk, I 'knew' how badly thing were back than. The conection, even thoght it was not something planned, is amazing.So the script is pretty decent, the speeches are fantastic, and some Churchill's scenes are remarqueble. The acting is just stunning, Gary Oldman is a monster, there isn't another way to describe he in this role, the guy is a legend, give him an Oscar. But also, the supporting cast is extremely competent here, Lily James give us a solid performance, with such a charism, even though she hasn't many lines throught the movie. Ben Mendelsohn is great as King George, Stannis Baratheon (just kiding) is very good too. Anyway, you get it, the cast is awesome.The soundtrack is ok, the montage is interesting, with some different styles, using like the calendar popping up on the screen, to show us how much time pass.Probably the only issues that I have with the movie is regarding the filming style, I think that the movie is great shoot, but sometimes the director seems to go a little bit over the top in some scenes, like the close up in the hands of the boy, or some going back shoot of the top of a building, anyway, is just a little thing. Also I think that the overuse the 'motivation speech' on Churchill's life, I don't know how much there is true (and this why is hard to judge) but every once in a while some one as to say some motivation words to him. Again, is not a big flaw, but those thing prevented the movie to be a 10/10 one for me.In short, Darkest Hour is a great film, and deserves to be in the Oscar run. Gary Oldman gives the best performance from him that I ever saw. And one really big plus is the powerful and great history that the movie tells, one of the most important figures of mankind in modern times, for sure.",9,1,4,15 February 2018
The Irishman," An instant classic
","The Irishman is great. The acting is insanely good (mainly De Niro, Pacino and Pesci). The score is soo good. And most of all, I love the movie's theme, it's a mob movie, it has kills and great other scene you will see in a great Scorsese mob movie, but at the end, it's really a movie about growing old.Mostly in its last 40 minutes or so, the movie has so many great lines and moments. Mainly the end, with De Niro just looking at the door, basically waiting for death really, cause everybody he knows is dead, and his family isn't really his fan, based on the choices he made throughout his life. And the mob part of it aside, the theme here of growing old and at a point basically waiting for death to come is a scary thought, and something I've seeing happening before, so that's powerful.When the FBI agent goes to talk with Frank and says 'everybody is gone', is also such a powerful line.I didn't have much of a problem with the runtime, but basically because I didn't watch the movie on the spot, I might have made a mistake, but I watched in parts first 47 minutes, then almost 2 hours, than the last hour or so. So yeah, you may wanna judge for that.Well, really, there isn't a bad thing I can say about the movie, it's perfect, the guy is a filmmaking genius. One thing I will say tho, is that the de-aging is great, awesome that we got to this point in time regarding technology, but their body seems... weird still. Going forward I don't know if that
would be an effective way to make older actors seem like their younger selves for a good part of a movie. Because they seem like 40, 50-year-old De Niro, and Al Pacino, but they don't move like it... it is still an almost 80 years old actor moving like an almost 80-year-old actor, and you can see it in a few scenes.",9,0,3,5 January 2020
Superbad," So great!!
","It's amazing to see this movie again, and realize how much other stuff that came out after was inspire for it. In my point of view, that really means something.The movie itself is hilarious, Michael Cera and Jonah Hill are two of my favorite comedy actors out there, and see they work together in a kind of 'mix' of the two different comical style is really a great experience. The whole cast is tremendously talented, with Seth Rogen, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Emma Stone, Bill Hader, it would be very difficult to go wrong.The history is pretty original, and brings a 'refresh' for the genre, thinking about the period that it was realize, when we had a bunch of American Pie movies, and American Pie inspired movies.Besides that, isn't really much to talk about it, I don't want to give any spoiler, so I just rightly recommend you to check out, if you haven't seeing it yet.'MCLOVIIN!!'",9,2,3,19 October 2017
The Mummy," 20 years later and the movie still looks great, but the story definitely lost some weight
","I completely understand people seen this back in 99 and been blown way by it. Even tho it relies heavily on CGI in some parts (mostly the Mummy stuff). It's still pretty good, the effects pretty much hold up, I mean it isn't as jaw dropping as it might have been 20 years ago, but still, I give them credit for the cinematography and production design here, the movie was made back in a time when movies were trying to figured out how much they should rely on CGI, and I think this one nailed it, it has a great mixture of CGI and great sets, and special effects. And this is probably never going to change much, it will have this re watchability for years to come.The story tho, it's a bit basic. Again, I can understand it being great back in 1999, but some parts of it, like the lady who falls for the big hero, and they finally get together at the end, aren't exactly that appealing nowadays. Plus, I didn't buy their chemistry.Finally, I just think that the finale feels a bit drag out, the movie feels longer than it actually is. 1h40 to 1h50 it's a range that might have made the movie a couple scores better for me.Just to point out some weird stuff that bothered me:So, you commit a crime, a terrible one, and your punishment (besides the eternal suffering) is... to be immortal and indestructible?3000 years guarding the tomb... so when outsiders show up, messing around and going into your sacred place, you give them a warning ('you have until tomorrow to leave or you'll die') and then proceeds to leave and let them unsupervised while there is a possibility someone might awake ancient immortal monster you devoted your entire life to prevent from scaping? What? And this is actually a main turning point in the entire film, and it's such a lazy way out, that transforms those cool ninja-like soldiers into some dumbass that failed miserably in the one thing they devoted their lives to.Overall tho, the movie is fine, it has some great action scenes, the Mummy effect holds up pretty well even today, and I like Fraser as the lead, he is charismatic. I just feel like the fact I'm seen it 20 years after, when audiences have changed that much, and we've seen the same beats in a movie over and over again, that the movie's storyline most likely lost some power if you compared it with the power it had when it first came out in 1999. It's worth checking it out tho.6,5/10",6,0,1,6 June 2020
Troy," The war is good, the script not so much...
","The fight scenes are certainly the best thing about Troy, the strategies on the battlefield, and even some ancient myths are portrayed in a grandiloquent and very beautiful way of seeing. Aquiles (Brad Pitt) is the character who seems to work the most within the story (one of the few who can do that, by the way), much for the performance of Brad Pitt, who even arrogant most of the time, still be charismatic. The story as a whole no longer has so many trumps. The movie takes a long time to 'mesh,' and has a very slow start. And the script itself is not a primordial one, full of very vague dialogues, made only to establish things that will be used as hooks later (in a way not very subtle), and with a very inconstant rhythm, with huge stops, Rather than forced, that break the rhythm of the film without any very concrete reason. All in all, the film does not set out to give you a great, complex story line, so even with a mediocre script it's still a good war movie, with incredible fights and a visual of envy. Ps: The Hector vs Achilles fight is amazing!",6,0,0,13 May 2017
Deadpool 2," It's funny (and you already know that) but is also inconsistent
","I didn't expect that much of the first Deadpool movie, and I didn't expect that much of this one either. I'll be straight to the point here. The movie is fun, there are a lot of great jokes, Deadpool character is the heart and the soul of the movie, and this is great, Domino is also a great addition, Cable is ok, he works in the movie, even though the character is a bit misplaced.But what really makes the movie not reach its full potential is that they try to more than that, you know? They try to be, I don't know, a movie with some kind off depth? All the scenes, where Deadpool is kind of a 'limbo' between life and death, and talks with Vanessa, just doesn't work, it's completely out of place. There is also the death of Vanessa itself, it brings to a big part of the movie, a Deadpool that we really don't need to see, he is sad for some part, depressive, and ok, you can understand why is that, but this really isn't the type of movie that the character claim for. We don't need a sad Deadpoo, and by killing Vanessa this is what they went for (at least for some 30 minutes).I guess that people overal will love that one, I didn't love the first one that much (was good, not amazing), but I was really expecting just a fun, and unpretentious movie this time around again, but they try more, and it doesn't work.Just one more thing, before I forget, the CGI is really a bigger problem here that was in the first. Colossos seems worst than in the first one, and with the Fanatic addition it's hard to not notice that the budget was not the ideal here. And it's funny, because some time ago a report came out saying that Tim Miller part way to direct this one because he wanted more money, to do a bigger movie, and Ryan wanted to stay in the same 'indie movie' style, with less money, but, you know, if you are going to put a fight between to huge CGI monsters, you need a pretty decent budget to do it... (even Cable doesn't look the ideal). It isn't something that will ruin the entire experience, but you'll notice.In short, Deadpool 2 is a funny movie, there are a lot of great jokes, but it wastes much time trying to be more than just this, and Deadpool really isn't that type of character.",5,2,9,20 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Another really fun Marvel movie
","I saw many people in the internet complaining about the 'fun vibe' of the movie. Well, guys, IT'S A MARVEL MOVIE! What the heck are you expecting?! The trailer sell me a fun movie, and this was exactly what I receive. Didn't you?Look, I'm a really critical about the excess of jokes in the Marvel movies, I really believe that in some of them it doesn't work at all (like Civil War, Age of Ultron, Doctor Strange). But here in Ragnarok for me was a improve, comparing with the other Thor movies (the first one suck, and the second it's fun, but not that much too).Chris Hemsworth has amazing comic skills (way better than his 'dramatic' ones), Mark Rufallo is great too, Tom Hiddleston, etc etc (you get it, the cast is great).The movie isn't a master piece (like Joss Whedon said), far away from that, they bet on the save (again), but this time works. Cate Blanchett is F#CKING INCREDIBLE on the movie! And that is a improve when you think in the MCU (you know... the majority of the villains in the movies suck). So, in short, for me Ragnarok is another very entertaining, fun, and well done Marvel movie. Doesn't will win an Oscar or something, but it's good, and mainly, a lot better than the first two.",8,48,85,31 October 2017
"I, Tonya"," My God! They are really learning how to do a biography film, aren't they?
","Till this past year I had a problem with most 'biography' that I watched, the only one that I really loved was The Imitation Game, although, this past year made me change my mind. 'I, Tonya' is another great biography movie that came out this year.The acting is gorgeous, Margot Robbie and Allison Janney are the highlights of it, they kill in their roles, but I also like a lot of Paul Walter Hauser's performance. Sebastian Stan is good too.In fact, this part (the acting) was what I came to the movie expecting, just amazing acting and a 'ok' movie, but my God, the movie is thrilling and entertaining for the entire run time. The soundtrack is fantastic, every song fits almost perfectly in each scene. The editing is awesome, they mix some 'interview' scene through the main history, with narration, and fourth wall breaks, and it works! Otherwise, the movie would be just an assembly of events in Tonya's life leading to this one moment, but the montage change this scenario completely. You understand Tonya's point of view, you get why she is like that, you might not like her overall, but you definitely gets the reason why she act like that. And this is probably my favorite thing about the movie, how they were able to pick the history and make something fresh with it, not just the ordinary dramatic arch that we saw over and over again. The history is sad in many ways, but the approach here is not only sadness, is also with a comic way.The movie has tension when it needs to have, it can make you cry when he needs to, and also could get some jokes in a lot of other moments. I love the direction here too, the actor's performance, the cinematography, the use of the slow-mo, the track, in a way, it almost always has the director's hand.The only issue that I might have with the movie are some of the skating scenes, I don't know how the could improve that, but in some shoot you just can't avoid notice that is just Margot's head in some else's body.In short, 'I, Tonya' is a terrific film, that approach this really challenging genre in a fresh and clever way. I love it.",9,1,1,16 February 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Uau
","This is the best way I can described. The movie has put me through so many different emotions. I've laughed (the movie has a strangely, but amazing sense of humor). I got angry. I got shocked. And I got sad.This is the type of story, we should stop, and listen to the message. It talks about a real thing, that everyone should be scared of. At least, everyone that isn't a jerk.Anyways, talking about the movie itself. I love how they put Topher Grace to play the Duke, I mean, I don't know i that was the goal, but everyone role Topher Grace is in, I can't see nothing else but Eric Forman (an skinny, loud, and dumb dude). He sounds like an prepotent idiot. And that's just gold, when you realize who he is playing.I love Adam Drive's performance, the dude is fantastic, amazing, as always, and I got his nomination, but John David Washington is awesome, he holds the movie in his shoulders for a lot of times. But overall, everyone is great in the movie, full of awesome performances. But a special should out to Laura Harrier, who is amazing as the president of the black movement, and, man, Corey Hawkins has basically one scene (the speech in the beginning of the movie), but wow, he simple destroys.I can't forget about Jasper Pääkkönen also, it's the first time I see something that he did, and man, he is incredible here, you have him for the first minute he's in the screen! And the character's goal is exactly that.I love how they do kind of a parallel between Drive's character and Ron (with in the beginning one 'defending' that one of the orgs - the black one and the KKK - 'weren't that bad'), you see kind of example in how sometimes, we can do wrong judgements, because certain group is 'similar' to us in some capacity (in this case, the skin color). Also talking about parallels, one of the most powerful scenes in the entire movie is the one they intercut between the KKK reunion, and the black power group reunion, the story which is told, is sad, but powerful, is at this point you start to be angry/scared until the end of it.The scene where they are watching The Birth of a Nation is incredible, and specially for me, I've never thought about the movie from this point of view (I thought more about all the technical innovations it brought to the screen), it gave KKK the power they had lost again. Yeah, screw that, screw you D.W. Griffith, you're jerk.The end is strong, is powerful, and it's majorly scary. It scares me (even though I'm not black) to see how dangerous the world can be, how hateful people can be, how distorted beliefs could transform a neighbourhood, a city, a state, a country... in a war zone. And most of all, how bad leaders, elected by people who mainly think about politics once every 2 years, could bring everything together. No, KKK members are not 'fine people', it's about give more power to 'one side' (whatever this may be), equality is about giving everyone the same amount of power/voice. KKK is not this, it's a bunch of white privileged racist jerks, that want to prove some dumb point.A last couple of things about the plot thought, that may be the only bad things I can think about the movie:
In the speech scene the editing is weird, they cut to a lot of faces in a black background, I thought it was odd, and they did it several times.
He just starts an investigation by... calling? I mean, he saw an advertise 'ok, I think I'll give it a shot', really? I know it's hard to talk about those specific things in a 'based on a true story' movie, but anyways.
Someone (from the police) puts him inside a KKK EVENT? How bad were that cops supposed to be? Are you putting your only black cop to be a security man in an event with a lot of extremist racists?To wrap up, BlacKkKlansman is a fantastic movie, which approaches a truly complex and important subject that must not be ignore in recent days. We must talk about it.9,5/10",9,5,10,13 February 2019
Scary Movie 2," Still funny, but definitely not as good as the first
","I thought the movie has some truly funny scenes (for example, the 'cold opening'). But after the first half it hour of it, the pace gets a bit slow, and the movie drags a little. It's a good parody movie for you to watch and just not think about anything.",6,0,0,6 February 2019
Black Mass," In an unattractive history, the performance of the actors makes the film worthwhile.
","A good movie. For me, biopic as a whole (and in some ways this is the case of this film) are part of a genre that is extremely difficult to make interesting, engaging, or at least curious to the public, that is, it requires a huge racing everyone involved in the production, and also that the story in question has some basis to be adapted to the cinema. Black Mass is not an example of excellence in this type of film, far from it, but can fulfill its role as a whole is good, has an extremely attractive story, and at times his many jumps in time cease all very chopped, but the whole experience is justified by a major factor: Johnny Depp. All actors in the main long core are fine in their roles, which already slightly increases the overall grade, but Depp is really fantastic, leaving those who really watches in fear for all who engage with him, even with some dramas placed within the story somewhat unresolved, all convictions and Jimmy Bulger motivations are extremely convincing in the hands of the great actor. Analyzing only the narrative and structure of the feature film the note would be 6 or even 5 though, as the evaluation can not just focus only on a few factors, but in all, 7 seems but fair, a good movie, which has great asset as the expertise of its actors.",4,4,5,30 December 2015
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A great story, with AMAZING performances!
","This movie has highs and lows for me. But waay more highs than lows.Let's start with the highs. I love almost every single performance on this movie. Everyone is simply great, with FANTASTIC performances especially from Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell. They won the Golden Globe, and I wouldn't be surprised if they win the Oscar too. And, come on, it will be fair. Woody Harrelson, and Lucas Hedges (we need to look at this boy more, first Manchester by the Sea, he is on Lady Bird too - I didn't see that yet -, and now this one, the boy is good, has a big future ahead) are also very good on the movie.The storyline of the movie is intriguing, and keeps you at the edge of your sit almost the entire runtime. I love mainly the first half of the movie, was almost perfect to me, how we get to see how the billboards thing goes, how everyone reacts to it, fantastic. There are some scenes that I really blown away. When they show what's really the only glance of Mildred daughter, when both say 'I hope that you/I are/am raped' (and this was probably the last time that they see each other) I said out loud 'Holy shit!', like, my God, this is heavy, makes you think about the way that you might treat your parents (or any member of the family) when you're upset (I never gotten to this point, but ok), makes you think that today might be the last time that you see someone that you love, so those last word are truly important, they will be stuck in your head for the last of your life, and there is nothing that you can do about it.When Willoughby kills himself was also a shocking moment, I didn't see it coming. But, made sense, and also makes you think about this man life, like, how sad was that? What would have been worst? His daughters see he at the end weak and skinny, or they group up knowing that he kills himself? It's tough. And mainly, that is why I love the first half of the movie, it's perfect, powerful, surprising, amazing.Well, and we arrive at the part when the thinks starts to get a little bit worst. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, awful or anything like that, it's just 'less good', and there are some plot details that I was quite bothered about.
First, what a hell was that? How a guy throws another guy out of a WINDOW (ON THE FIRST FLOOR OF A BUILDING) IN FRONT OF THE CHIEF AND DOESN'T GET ARRESTED? What kind of city is that? Lol. Some other thing that I didn't bought was that people really make a 'movement' around Mildred (defending the Chief), and one thing really made me confuse, the guy who goes bully Mildred at the store right before the Chief kills himself, was the same guy at the end? Like, wtf? He wasn't even from the Town, and still was friends of the Chief? I don't know, it might be, but is odd, isn't? It's a hell of a coincidence. I don't know if I like the end too, with a kind of 'force' ambiguity, I don't think 
that Mildred would shy away from killing him.Oh, another thing that I almost forgot. The 'zoo girlfriend', come on, she is in a completely different movie, both scene that he show up. Yes, the movie has a sense of humor, but it's a whole different kind, the girl it's almost in a parody trash movie. But the movie has a lot of other thing that I love, even through I think that makes no sense at all Dixon doesn't be arrested, I love the scene when they are in the hospital, and he realize what an asshole he was this whole time. Love the interrogation scene, the surprises of the script, and mainly the performances, this is really the great trump of the movie.In short, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri it's a great film, that will probably win an Oscar or two (or even more). I have some issue with it, but in the big picture, I really liked.Edit: I forgot, the soundtrack is awesome too. Really good.",8,2,3,11 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Disney did not have a plan
","I'm gonna start with the good. I love almost everything with Kylo/Ben (I even don't mind the kiss scene, whatever). To me, he is probably the one character in this sequel trilogy that has a consistent arc all throughout. I love that he redeemed himself, his fight scene with the knights (even though they are USELESS in this trilogy) is great, his fight with Rey at the Death Star is probably my favorite moment of the entire movie. I like his scene with Han, and even with all we know about the situation with Carrie Fisher, I think they handled they relationship fine, the fact that her death is what makes him turn to the light side again is beautiful. Again, the only character that has an arc throughout, he is by far my favorite thing about this trilogy.The movie is beautifully shoot. The score is amazing as always. The acting is phenomenal, Adam Driver kills it, Daisy Ridley is awesome, Ian McDiarmid is great, I mean, c'mon, the IS the emperor. Everyone is good in the movie, acting is far from being the problem here.My biggest issue tho, might be that LucasFilm clearly did not had a plan when they did Force Awakens. I love Episode 7, I love Episode 8, and I'll defend them, for years to come, but man, looking back now, this whole trilogy doesn't speak at all within itself. Episode 9 feels more like a sequel to Episode 7, with random stuff to 'end the entire saga' threw in there. No matter what JJ or LucasFilm say about it, they did retconned Rey's origin, Ryan Johnson set it pretty clear that they were nobodies, they were drinkers, and etc, do not tell that 'for a certain point of view they were nobodies' or that 'they choose to be like that' no, you did retconned JJ, and that sucks. Even if you didn't like TLJ, you have to agree that sticking with Ryan did in the movie was the only way to finish this trilogy some way cohesive, when you deny your own movie, you basically lost a bunch of time with something for nothing. You are trying to finish a trilogy with only two movies. That's the biggest mistake overall with the trilogy, they didn't have a plan initially, and even though I love TFA and TLJ, they finale is mess up because of the lack of communication between the chapters here.Going into the specifics, I hated what they did with Rey specifically. I talked with some people that liked it, and I'm fine with that, I wanted to like it as well, I really did, and I'm disappointed I didn't. But man, it makes no sense at all that she's related do Palpatine, and I also, I just hate the move. I hate because of what I said previously, you took away one of the strongest messages from TLJ, which is 'anyone, coming from anywhere, can do great things in life', that was powerful, and beautiful, and when you throw 'oh, actually she's Palpatine's granddaughter', I mean, c'mon! Why? I really didn't need this connection at all, make her a clone or something, it would have been better, could explain why she is so damn powerful, and at the same time wouldn't erase what Ryan did in 8. And, it doesn't make sense when you watch the 9 movies as its own thing. You are telling me that the most powerful Sith ever had a son (at some point during the original trilogy I would assume...?) and that was NEVER a factor? Wasn't relevant at all? Wasn't he also powerful? Why in the hell would Palpatine to do all that with Anakin then? If he could only have a child that would be freaking powerful, or had the potential to? It's just a lazy explanation, that unfortunately comes with the backlash The Last Jedi suffered. 'The end of the Skywalker saga' deserved more, way more.Talking about the Skywalker saga 'thing' then. That pressure they had to 'wrap it all up in one movie'... was something they put on themselves, it's JJ and is Kathleen Kennedy who said over and over again that this movie would do that. We didn't ask for it, but you said you were going to do it, so... that's on you. I would charge you for what you promised me. To me one of the biggest issues I had with the movie is due to that try to wrap it all up (even though you aren't actually showing almost any characters from the other 6 movies...), it does some lazy choices (like 'Rey Palpatine') and tries to have a huuuuge finale, that seems so shallow at the end. Palpatine went from hitting some people with lightning in Episodes 3 and 6, to... crushing a whole fleet? And the only thing Rey needed to stop him was... to hold two lightsabers...? They level up the threats so much, that when they good guys win with fairly less power it seems so forced, we definitely didn't need the huge blue lighting finale. Bigger isn't exactly better in this situation. Again, Ryan Johnson wrapped up his movie without actually having a fight scene.The fact that Palpatine came back itself it's something I didn't like to begin with. Again, another proof that they didn't have a plan. Ryan killed Snoke, that was clearly supposed to be the 'big bad guy' of this new trilogy, and now what do you do...? 'Well, let's bring the emperor back'. It seems really forced, to me it really it's a detriment of what Luke and Anakin did in episode 6.A bunch of other stuff seems out of left field. Finn's arc it's the better exemplification of this movie trying more to be a sequel to 7 than to 8. He is force sensitive, fine, it was something some people assumed coming out of TFA, but there is nothing, literally nothing that continues this plot line in episode 8, and than... well, let's hurry up! The trilogy is ending, we need people to know he's force sensitive! Even though it doesn't influence at all the story of the film... (besides him magic knowing which ship to destroy at the end). Again, this in specific doesn't really make the movie better or worse to me, it's just an exemplification of how this trilogy as a whole doesn't speak within itself.To wrap up, I was really disappointed with this movie, it did hurt my feelings about The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, and I thought it did a horrible job on wrapping the nine movies up. Well, to be honest, it couldn't even wrap the sequel trilogy up, imagine the nine movies. Anyways, now, 40 years after, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you are my only hope. Let's forget about the Skywalker Saga for good now, Disney. Just give me the Obi-Wan series, and let's move forward now.4,5/10",4,20,34,30 December 2019
The Godfather: Part II," It stills great, but Part I is better
","The movie is basically perfect in almost all the elements. Acting (Al Pacino is once again destroying on the role, De Niro is also great, well, everybody are great here), Coppola's direction is fantastic. The movie itself is technically perfect.But, for me, some things make the movie not better as the first one. The first was (for me) straight to the point, it have one thing, and it moves the plot all along. Well, this isn't a rule or something, the movie can make something diferent and also be great (and this movie is great), but, some things dont fit as much for me. The whole young Don plot, at the end, I didn't saw that much that make this whole part of the movie all that relevant. It doesn't show really how Vito grow up on the mafia thing, I don't know, the parts are good, the mix with some scene of the present are really great, but, at the end, if their aren't here, the movie will still works the same. Another thing is the story of the movie itself, seems like they shows somethings, but not much as they should show, seems like that goal was to show 20 years of his life, and this is it.But dont get me wrong, the movie is fantastic, was the longest movie that I saw and I really was hopping for more at the end, doesn't look like it's more than 3 hours long, and this is fantastic.In the end of the movie is great to look how diferent Mike has became from Vito, when in the last scenes we see him almost completely alone, he lost all his family, and he has not became a better Don that his ever was.Well, in short, The Godfather - Part II is a amazing film, but, for me, the masterpiece is the first one.",9,0,1,30 December 2017
Nightcrawler," Lou isn't the real problem, but the society who creates and rewards this type of people
","At first I thought about just giving the movie the 10/10, without actually writing anything. However, I finally come up with something to write. I usually to these reviews to mainly remind myself of what I thought about the movie right after seeing it, something I get lazy and don't write anything, and sometimes I forced myself to it. I loved this movie, and it got me at the egde of my sit the entire runtime basically, but it was difficult to find a specific thing I wanted to remind myself in the future.I saw some videos analyzing the movie, and bringing up the best parts of it, and the one that hock me the most was the one by the YT Channel 'Lessons from the Screenplay' dissecting the art of building a story throughout the eyes of an anti-hero (or what some people would say, a villain, in this case). The way the film builds itself, and the layers the screenplay has are amazing, but at the end, the main reason why at some point we get ourselves rooting for the guy in a certain degree, is because at the end of the day, he is a perfect example of a 'villain' created by society, our sensationalists news shows, wanting ratings more than the true, or even covering the most relevant stories at all, and even more, the industry that rewards this type of person, not only in the news business in this case, but the rewarding of people doing bad things overall, it's something that's overlooked, and will continue to be so as long as it makes money. That's the most amazing thing I took from this movie's story. Keep it in mind, future me.The acting is kind of a silly thing to talk about it at this point, Jake Gyllenhaal is insane, every new movie I watch from him, I become more and more a fan. The dude is ridiculously talented, has an insane charisma, and it's clearly committed as f# in his holes (he lost 20 pounds for this role). Everyone in the movie is awesome, Ahmed is great as well, he is also really talented. Everyone is basically solid as a rock in the movie.The last 20 minutes of it are insanely thrilling, the build up to it is perfect, you feel the urge, you care for what's in stake. Amazing. I truly don't have a single bad thing to point out here, so, I can't do anything but giving it a 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,5 August 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Once again: Not everybody can turn a biography in a great movie
","'ll be short, I'm not much a Queen fan (I mean, I like some songs, but I've never followed the band. Mainly because I was born some years after Mercury's death) so I believe I'll have a neutral vision about the movie (I'm far from being a hater too).Anyways, the songs scenes, live the composition of some sounds, how the band was innovated, and etc is what the movie does best, besides the acting (mainly from Rami Malek) of course. However, the movie fails on actually being a movie, there is no clear narration of events here, I mean, sure the movies the band's ascension, until what was probably their peak, but there not actually a story, some things come and go, and you never see a thing evolving from that the first agent Freddy fires, he makes a huge treat and so, but we never see him again, and other things too.But as is hard to make a good cine biography, is also hard to judge it, sometimes I don't know how exactly I'm supposed to grade it, was it made for the fans/followers? Was it supposed to be a romanization of the real story? And here, I believe they tried to do something of the fans, which is completely ok, but for what I've seen, there are actually tons gafs/mistakes throughout the story, and what indeed happened, I saw a lot of real fans complaining. So, at the end, what is the point on try to be for the fans, and 'real', while you are ignoring a lot of important details of the real story?There is no much of a learning curve here, besides kind of a forced one at the end, and the movie is basically a bunch of scenes of shows and Queen's amazing songs cut together. Just will not give a lower grade, because of the songs (which are truly great), and Malek's performance, he deserved the Oscar nomination, the movie did not.",4,0,1,23 February 2019
American Pie," I'm surprise how good the movie still is!
","I hadn't seen American Pie since I was a teen, so with this whole quarantine going on, and a lot of time to spend I was like 'screw it I'm gonna re watch the whole saga (?)'. And I'm gonna be honest, I went to this movie not expecting much, after all, is a 95 minutes long teen comedy that's already 21 years old. But man, it's still pretty good!In the end, I think is fair to call it a 'classic' of R rated teen comedies, since it inspired a bunch of other movies all throughout the 2000's. And it's well deserved, some few jokes didn't age that well, but it's probably one or two moments. But overall, the movie is pretty funny! At first, I didn't exactly like the characters, but after 20/30 minutes you kind get behind most of them, I think Kevin might be the only one I didn't exactly was rooting for. Oz has some kind of an arc, which is cool, and the scenes of Jim with his dad are just pure gold. Eugene Levy destroys here, and steals the show.Of course, some parts of it probably wouldn't get made today (like the whole sequence broadcasting the girl in Jim's room). I think that it doesn't have to take the movie's credit of been funny. You have to always stay open minded to judge how something used to be done, and see why it was wrong and how we can improve moving forward. I just think that when you analyze a movie you should always try to consider the it was made, and the circumstances around it. If you think about it, she was masturbating in a strange's house, so, well, she wasn't that less of a creepie.Anyways, at the end, is a movie with sex jokes, about some dudes getting laid, but is also a bit about friendship which I thought was cool. 99% of people that watch it, are probably gonna want to laugh and not think about anything else, and for that, this movie is perfect, is 21 years old, but still so funny. As we would say here in brazil, is a 'besteirol' classic.Obs: Just wanna point out some of my favorite specific moments: Man, the pie scene! Lol, that's probably my favorite interaction of him and his dad (that and the 'I want you to be careful when you put... the croissant'); Stifler's mom saying 'I have an aged 18 whisky... just how I like it' is just pure gold; The whole storyline which Finch and the rumors are great too.",8,1,1,11 June 2020
The Revenant," A great movie
","Great movie. After a movie in my opinion overrated (Birdman), director Alejandro González Iñárritu last delivery in a decent prize work. The Revenant is not 100% plan sequence as the trailer could fail to understand, instead alternating between small parties in this style and in normal courts or with spotlights on the stage, which makes the experience of watching it much more dynamic, satisfying and without saturation. Long Photographic is excellent, with amazing scenery, and all featuring the characters be very good. Leonardo DiCaprio, even without a lot of lines, is once again amazing in the role of protagonist, giving all the emotional charge needed for a character so full of feeling, the largest being the rage. Moreover, it is not only DiCaprio worth mentioning, Tom Hardy is very good in his role as antagonist, and Will Poulter surprises in its performance, even with a character who is not very well worked during his screen time, he can add ( and) charisma and other elements on a solid, lucid performance. The whole concept of the story is engaging, not needing much time to the viewer Imerse completely in the narrative, but the way how it is developed further help in this regard. But nothing is perfect, on the one hand the construction of some characters is very good, the other is bad, Hawk (son of DiCaprio) is a character who just seems to be there to cause trouble in no time becomes very clear if there a motif defined for it, or if it is simply stupid. The film's soundtrack also does not please me, leaving much to be desired, and in some part to annoying. In short: The Revenant is a great film certainly has its faults, but still is a great movie with great performances, outstanding photo and an engaging story, very worth watching.",8,4,10,4 January 2016
American Psycho," An odd journey through the mind of a psycho
","I don't need a lot of lines to talk about this movie, it's simply amazing. It's extremely well done, has a pretty clever script, some fantastic performances (hello, Christian Bale), and, what make the movie some awesome ambiguity that makes you think a lot after see it, because it has so many layers that is impossible to understand right away.All the issues that I had with the movie falls apart when I reach the conclusion that at least the majority of the thing does not happened, at least, not in that way that we saw in the movie, and this is fantastic, I thought about it, after saw the film, and I remembered some pieces of advices that the story give to us in order to say that this isn't necessarily true. The movie is fascinating, at the same time that it talks about the Psychos and all that these people thing, and feel (or not feel), it talks also about the 'american way of life' the yuppie culture, and how much some people (or everyone) are everyday becoming more and more empty, apathetic, almost 'robots' from the system. And I'm certainly that if I think more about it, I will find more and more symbolism.The tension in some moments really got me, I was apprehensive in many scenes, the soundtrack really helps it.In short, American Psycho is a smart and fascinating film, that tells a story that not everyone wants to talk about it.9,5/10",9,1,1,26 December 2017
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," The consolidation of the greatest action franchise in movie history
","You may have a different franchise as your all time favorite action one, but you have to admit, no other as come this far, with this quality (hi, Die Hard). This is the FIFTH film of the saga, and it might be the best one.I just love, the way they have reinvented the franchise, and turned into a pure episodic, fun, and engaging adventure (aside from the CRAZINESS that is the technical aspect here). I could easily watch a new Mission Impossible movie ever 3 years for the next 20 years. The sad thing is, that Tom Cruise is mortal, so, he probably won't be doing this stuff 20 years from now. But man, what a franchise, and what a movie.It's amazing how this movie is able to mix the tense 'vibe' from the first one (something that MI3 and 4 weren't able to do), with the frenect and gorgeous action scenes from its two predecessors.The movie starts by just knocking out of the park, with an incredible airplane sequence, that is also extremely funny (another hit, that started with Ghost Protocol).The cast main cast is probably the best assemble on the franchise. Even though Paula Patton is great in MI4, Rebecca Ferguson simply DESTROYS in this movie. She is sexy as hell, but also a f#cking badass character, you can in the same scene fall in love with her, but also be frecking scared. She is just fantastic. Jeremy Renner is a win too, he was great in Ghost Protocol, and I was glad they brought him back. Bring Ving Rhames back was another thing they got it right, the guy has so much chemistry with the whole cast (mainly with Cruise). And, well, do I really need to talk about Simon Pegg and Tom Cruise? Pegg is such a talent actor, he is charismatic, funny, and every other compliment you can think of, he is just amazing.And Tom Cruise... man, I don't even know what else I can say about him, the guy is a monster, a movie legend. Not only he is a great actor (like, with actual acting skills), but man, his commitment with this franchise is something unique, and is so great to see scenes that are performed by the actor (not an stuntman) and also shot in a real location. The same thing Keanu Reeves or Jack Chan do with their fight scenes, Cruise does here with those big action sequence. It's fantastic. Again, say what you have to say about the guy, but you have to admit that this is frecking awesome.And, for me what makes this one competes with MI3 for the spot of the best one of the five, is that even the biggest problem that this franchise has had for the last 20 years doesn't show up here. The villain is actually pretty decent. He has enough back story, a great performance by Sean Harris, and you know, is decent overall, not a great villain, but a good one, that doesn't holds the movie back.The story is engaging, an almost 'classic' rogue organization story, that you saw before in other movies (a couple of Bond ones, for example), but this is fine. A movie not always need to reinvent the genre (in a storytelling perspective), if are into the characters, it's enough (and hell yeah, this is definitely the case here). The end is really clever though, a finale without a 'huge action outcome', cause we already had that throught the movie, so is fun to be surprised by it (also, it's another caracteristic that was brought back from the first movie. Really cool).To conclude, Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation is a fantastic movie, not only for those casual moviegoers but also for all the hardcore movie fans, that want to analyse it deeply. Definitely a must-see one for any action fans out there.",9,0,0,28 July 2018
Dunkirk," Who said that a movie always need a main character and a backstory for him?
","That's really my only question for those who doesn't like the movie. Seriously guys, who said that? Where is written this 'cinema rule'? Look, I'm saying this, because the only main issue that I hear people saying is that 'the movie doesn't develop any main character, any backstory for no one, etc etc etc'. Well, about this, the only thing I had to say is: The movie is about the war.And, OMG, he is so well built on that, to the first second of the movie to the final one's, you're in the war, in a dirty, dense and sad war, when everyone's goal is to go home. And that is it, the movie is quite short (and this is a good thing), and straight to the point, the main goal is to pass this image and he succeeds.In my opnion, this whole 'no one knows any one in the war' thing was amazing! Becausa this is problably the sad true, on this situations you will not have a 'hey, where you from? Do you have family?' moments, around the campfire and stuff, so people die alone, people die besides other people that they dont even know the name, and this is it. Trully this was one of the things that I most love about the movie, it is simplistic in a way, while it does something that amost any war movie did in the whole movie history.Well, but this leave me on the thing that I find the most 'weird' down there, still on this whole 'no history characters' thing, problably the only moment that the movie tries to do something like this, it kind of floops. See, it isn't 'bad', 'awful' or anything like that, but (with out spoilers) in the middle of the film we see one especific character passing through a really tough moment, and I had two thoughts about that: (1) Only that only thing was strong enogh to do all this with the guy? (2) They try to build a emotional background, and a history connect with a newspaper that really dont get me, 'hero at Dunkirk', ooh, come on, why? I know, I'm not complain about this especific thing on the history, in the majority of the movie it will work, but just doesn't fit here, that was not the type of movie that they were building.But just this little thing doens't take out all the great thing that the movie has. Of course, we need to talk about the cinematography, the stunts and extra work, it's great, amazing, beautifull, in fact, I dont have words to describe this part of the movie, is simply mind blowing, I never saw anything like that. Paraphrasing one of my favorite movie critics (Chris Stuckman) 'this is simply what movie was invented for', that is the best way to describe what this movie does.In short, Dunkirk is a beautiful movie, that break some walls and run of the cliches out there, in a great and sad history, that at the same time shows the best and the worst of the humankind.9,5/10",9,0,0,13 December 2017
The Favourite," The cinematography and the acting are phenomenal, but the story is nuts
","I don't have much to say about this movie. Just that the cinematography is amazing, I love it, the movie has your on style, with different cameras, some wide shots and things that play with the perspective, and that part is incredibly. The acting, also is prety good, shout out to Emma Stone, Rachael Wisz, and Nicholas Hoult.However, the story itself is not that good, overall the movie is prety boring, and it doesn't know if it's a comedy, or a drama, really, there are some scene with Charlie Chaplin level of comedy (like fisical comedy), and others with a serious approach, and I don't know, the movie just seems like it takes itself too serious sometimes.The story itself is somewhat uninteressent as well.5,5/10",5,1,7,24 February 2019
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," MI3 started, but Ghost Protocol continued taking the franchise to a whole other level
","It's amazing to see, how the Mission Impossible franchise evolved over the years. Today, it's something completely diferent to what it was back in the 90's, but this evolution was, in a certain way, fluid. MI3 kind of started to change the 'franchise's focus' back in 2006, after an awful MI2, and Ghost Protocal definitely continued that. Cruise, once again, it's incredible, this is where he is comfortable, he knows what he is doing, and man, he knocks out of the park. I love it. The whole supporting cast is amazing again. With one addtion here, this is probably the first time since MI1 that we actually see a team really working on the field with him (like, fighting and stuff). Paula Patton is great, the addition Simon Pegg to the main cast was a hit too, and Jeremy Renner is also amazing. Regarding to cast, probably the only thing that you could say was 'missing' here was Ving Rhames, but I don't, they might have had a good reason for that.And, you knew what was coming, we need to talk about the stunts here. Besides a couple of weird look CGI scenes (like the explosion), the movie is MIND BLOWING. The building scene... man! What a gorgeous sequence. I was really scare just to imagine how the f#ck they shot this thing. Man, it's just fantastic, the chasing scene that follows it is also amazing. And really, this movie opened up the path for what we saw in Rogue Nation, and will probably see on Fallout, just and increasing amount of mind blowing sequences shot by Cruise (WITHOUT STUNTMANS). Really, where will this franchise end up? Movie by movie, I just can't imagine how they will improve from the last one, and they always do!Well, probably the main issue here is the villan. There isn't much to say about it, it's just a bad guy, that is bad because... he is. There isn't depth at all, and well, this is probably what the franchise has showed us is its main difficult, the only great villan we had was in MI3, and besides that, you kind of forget the other movies' villans. But the rest is great, so it holds up.To sum up, Ghost Protocol is a great movie. The Mission Impossible franchise is fantastic. It proves itself more every movie, in order to be without a doubt the best action franchise of all time.8,5/10",8,0,0,27 July 2018
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," A lot of fun
","I'm revisiting the Jurassic Park movies. I'vent seen them since I was 5 or 6 (about 15 years ago) so I'm basically seen them for the first time, and knowing what I know, I went to this movie didn't expecting much, knowing people don't like this one nearly as much as the first. But overall, I had fun with it, and my family did as well.At first, I thought it would suffer from the element of 'man, we didn't have as much Dinos in the first one, we have to fill this one with Dinos'. And sure, this movie has way more Dinos all throughout when you compare to the first one, and mostly for the first 30/40 minutes of it, I thought the CGI was somehow worst than the first one. However, after the T-Rex appears, I thought the movie had some great moments. I love the animatronics they used here, the T-Rex almost never seen like they are CGI, like the first one, but still, here we have way more scenes with the T-Rex than in the first one. The T-Rex baby is also great!We get some great Ian moments, some great scenes, like the Velociraptors in the fields, the T-Rex splitting a guy in half, Juliane Moore's character falling in a glass almost breaking in one of the most suspenseful scenes I've seen in a while, etc etc. I think it could definitely have had 15ish minutes less than it ended up having, and overall, the characters are way dumber here when compared to the first. But still, when you compare with a movie like Jurassic World 2 (again, 'we have to come back to the Island, for... some reason' story), I had way more fun watching The Lost World (and it's 20 years older).One thing I will say tho, for some reason, I didn't like the score here as much as I liked the first one's. I actually went and looked afterwards, if it was really John Williams that did it, and... it was. Idk tho, I found it oddly different from the first one, and not nearly as impactful when we most needed it to be.I truly didn't care for any characters that weren't Ian tho, and that's probably a downside. The finale is a bit... unnecessary I would say (and definitely foreshadowing what came next), even thought I loved the Dino in the city scenes. The chase, and almost every aspect of the scene is well made, and entertaning, is just... rushed, idk. I hope they can get this right in JW3 (I haven't seen JP3 yet, but since everyone hates it, I'm not with high expectations).The gymnastic scene? Sure, it's sooo dumb lol. I laugh when I saw it. It's probably the dumbest thing in the whole film.Overall tho, I think the movie is a lot of fun, I have some minor issues with the first minutes and the setup of it all, some parts are really predictable, the villains are... of course, just bad cause... reasons. But it's fine. More than 20 years later, the movie holds up, and aged well, has some fun stuff and iconic scenes, and of course, I love Jeff Goldblum in it.Obs: That final shot is insanely good, it's probably the first day light scene, in both movies, that the CGI is great, and even today, seems as real as you could get from most movies (but 20 years older).6,5/10",6,0,0,17 May 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," I mean... was there any possible scenario where this film isn't good? C'mon
","I really believe that what most reviewers out there are saying about this movie is accurrate, even within Tarantino's films, this movie is definitely one of the less 'standard audience friendly', I get that most regular moviegoers would say it's 'boring' or something like that. However, if you appreaciate cinema just a bit more, I can't see a way you wouldn't like this movie.For me, just the fact that we have Pitt and DiCaprio working together for the first time would be by itself a reason to watch this movie in loop for 10 hours. As you would expect they are ridicously awesome, and every scene is delightful to watch. Thanks, Tarantino, really.Margot Robbie doesn't have as much screen time as I thought she would had, but she is awesome as Sharon Tate.I mean, there isn't much else to say, it might not be Tarantino's best movie (Pulp Fiction is still my favorite), but Pitt and Leo are awesome to see, the story is well written (as you would expect), and man... the third act, holy cow, I love what he did with the whole Manson thing, and I thought it was some what beautiful, the fact that in his version of the story, Tate is still alive, and those jerks were destroyed by Brad Pitt and his awesome pitbull. I thought it was really sweet (in a weird way), and gives you a bittersweet taste at the end, thinking about what really happened, and also thinking about the movie.Anyways, to sum up, Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood is a great film, that movie lovers will watch and be amaze by it. The description 'it's a love letter to film' is 110% accurate, and I wouldn't change a thing about it.Second viewing note: After seen the movie again, really my only issues with it is that the ranch scene seems like it goes on for more that it should go, and kind of drags a bit. And the heavy narration that starts at the last 40 minutes of the movie is at least... different. Overall, I changed the grade from a 8,5 to a 9. I love every second that Brad Pitt and Leo DiCaprio are on the screen together. What a duo.",9,7,19,21 August 2019
Drive," Yeah, I've tried, but the whole allegedly symbolism is bs. The first half of the movie is boring and predictable.
","I'm gonna be quick. I love the oppening scene. But as I said, the first half of the movie is predictable and boring. At first, the 'chemistry' between the driver and the girl is really out of nowhere, even though it becomes cute at the end. I like when the movie starts to give glimpses of insane violence, I thought it was unexpected, but cool. And I like, overall, the second half of the movie. I just think those mafia guys were to dumb to not have any type of protection at night, after a party, when a clearly dangerous guy is still wanting to kill them.The acting is great. The soundtrack it's not good all the time, but I like the main song.",6,1,6,28 March 2019
Room," Simply amazing
","Amazing. A tense, intriguing, sad and compelling story, addressed in an excellent way, in a way that can maximize all these aspects are of vital importance in the construction of the entire film, this is a brief summary of all quality Room. But it is not only that, the performance - just like in any great movie - is another plus point, (and very positive!) Both Brie Larson protagonists (which competes for the best actress Oscar in 2016) and Jacob Tremblay (which could easily compete for the prize as well), has a great chemistry, which is vital for a film with much of their time focused on only a quarter, and, of course, both individual performances are magnificent, Brie goes all the anguish and anxiety that your character must have already Tremblay easily changes ingenuity of times to other distress and even happiness, with a fluidity simply fantastic, and the most frightening: He's only 9 years! A great movie, which is very well the difference in quality Oscar to competing films compared to last year, really worth watching.",9,0,4,23 February 2016
The Lion King," The level of technology we have reached is insane, the movie is astonishing real
","One will argue what was the point of doing a remake that is almost bit for bit what the original movie was. And this is a fair point. But I'll talk about it later.
First I have to talk about the movies' positives. It's insane. The photo realistic animals are almost flawless, if they didn't talk, you could think you were watching an Animal Planet show or something. It's that level of perfection. And even the talking part, I think they handled pretty well, it doesn't feel strange. The voice acting is awesome too. Mainly Seth Rogen as Pumbaa steeled the movie for me.Well, and I think that's it as far as positives go. Of course, you will watch it, be amazed by the technology, and also entertained by the story, cause it's the original Lion King's story. But I understand the ones who asked for more in a remake as big as this one.The Lion King is a difficult property to reboot, knowing how well received the first movie was and still is, it's really difficult to think about a way to re-telling the story while still doing something new without pissing fans off. But when you have that much money and minds behind it, you have to do it. The technology is awesome, and this will certainly be remembered as a turning point in animation history decades from now. But still, I believe you needed more to justify rebooting such an important franchise.The story is almost bit for bit the same, there are 3 or 4 new scenes, that don't add nothing new to it, it's just to get to the 2 hours run time. The photo realism is amazing, but it can also be viewed as a problem, because of that realism the characters show very little emotion (I mean, it's hard to make a Lion show human-like emotions), I also found that because of realism as well, it was really hard to distinguish between some characters, namely the lionesses, when they weren't talking I had basically no idea if it was Nala or Simba's mother. Those are some of the two points I believe the original one beats this one quite easily.To sum up, the movie is entertaining, and it's for sure a turning point in movie technology, as Star Wars or Avatar were before it. It's historical. However, in the end, the question that remains is if we really needed this turning point to be in a Lion King re-imagination, that isn't really a re-imagination.",7,1,4,24 July 2019
Kick-Ass," You have to see this movie if you like cinema!
","I had seen the movie for some time, and had in my mind it as one of the best things I had ever seen in the movies. After revealing it ... THIS REALLY IS THE PURE TRUTH! Let's try to start with 'top'. Matthew Vaugh's direction is impeccable, with few dialogues and scenes he manages to bring depth from the protagonist of the film, Dave Lizewski (Aaron Tayler- Johnson), to his friend with fewer lines, Todd (Evan Peters). Not as if this were any surprise, because I really want to live to see a bad movie directed by that man! Simply phenomenal !. I do not have anything to complain about in the script, there are no loose ends practically, and maybe even following a 'safe' line, he looks different in his 'backbone,' giving a face that we've never seen before for 'superheroes.' What today Deadpool is known to have done, and super lauded and credited, Kick-Ass had already mastered it more than half a decade before. So I think the timing of a film production is one of the things that makes it a big flop, or a big hit. Maybe it debuts today, Kick-Ass would just be 'one more' because of the 'saturation' of the industry, maybe if it had come out in the early 2000s, the movie would have been a gigantic flop, because the audience might not be Ready for it yet, and for the good fortune of all of us, this movie masterpiece came out exactly when it had to leave! I can not stop talking about the characters / actors, which are a high point as well. It would be impossible to speak of all here, but it is worth mentioning Aaron Johnson (the Kick-Ass), who holds the film with mastery, making us believe that he really is a nerdy misfit, even though not looking like one, and giving us laughter in Many moments, where the film makes that grace, making a mixture of 'R Comedy' with action of a 'Tarantino level'. Chloe Moretz, (Hit Girl) is definitely in the role of her life, I've seen some other movies of her, and my God, this girl was really born for this role! With an air of 'innocent' in some moments, but 'bad-ass' in others (even for a 10-year-old girl), if the character is not the best, it is certainly one of the best things in the movie. And finally, a good movie always needs a big antagonist, and Mark Strong (Frank D'Amico) brings a villain stuffed with clichés of gangster movies, or even some superheroes around, but works extremely well in your proposal! Being a kind of walking whimper, which refers to countless other productions, the character is the 'cake cherry' that the film needed (besides the final fight scene, where we really get scared by a certain character). Anyway, even NICOLAS CAGE will rock in that movie! Well, if you like heroes, or even if you like an excellent action movie, an excellent comedy, adventure movie ... actually: IF YOU LIKE CINEMA! You have to see this movie, everyone needs to see this movie, which comes up sloppy (like the protagonist at the beginning of the story) with only good intentions, and eventually becomes much bigger than I thought it could be .",10,1,3,31 January 2017
Call Me by Your Name," Incredibly immersive
","This movie is really great. Some of the aspects that I like the most was the unusual way that it do somethings. Like the sound mixer, it's a little the detail, but is amazing how this tiny little point chances your whole experience into the movie. The fact that the movie has a kind of 'natural' sound, without mix of volumes or something like that, makes you fell like if you were there. In fact, this is my favorite point of the entire movie, you fell like if you were there, at the end, it's almost like if you just visit Italy. Those little and apparently without meaning scene, where you just see the character thinking, or the to guys just staring at each other, the unusual way that the storyline is structured make this a complete immersive experience.The acting on the movie is great too, amazing. Armie Hammer and TimothÃ©e Chalamet are fantastic in the film, great chemistry.I have one or two flaws with the movie. Like, 'why is everyone changing the language everytime?'. Well, and the last issue, it's just more of a question. Elio has 17 years, and ignore Armie Hammer real age, the guy has what? 28 at least? Anyway, my main question is: This was probably a pedophilia case, wasn't? lol.",8,0,5,12 January 2018
Ex Machina," A film that certainly raises questions
","A good movie. I think that before starting any evaluation it is valid to leave a personal opinion of mine recorded, which may influence a little until, the analysis. I can not not find, quite bizarrely, the great majority of the films that approach some aspect of the Artificial Intelligence. And in a way, Ex Machina emits that feeling, if only a little.Anyway, speaking of the film, in terms of acting all the main actors, in my view, are well, and they can give what is needed of each of them, in their respective roles. In the characters, Nathan (Oscar Isaac) for me is the one who gets the most damaged building, having some holes of motivation, or very superficial explanations for certain attitudes he takes. On the other hand, all the mystery around Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is built very well, leaving the curious spectator with the end result of much of the film, besides the good construction also of the story of Ava (Alicia Vikander). The script, as I said in the analysis of the characters, for me sins a little when it comes to the character of Oscar Isaac, leaving somewhat vague their motivations throughout history. Throughout the film we have that routine, but competent in this specific case, approach to Artificial Intelligence, entering into themes such as the creation of life, ethical barriers as well, and even the future of the world itself, with the emergence of a 'superior race 'Even if created by ourselves.It is also worth mentioning for most of the dialogues between Ava (Alicia Vikander) and Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson), which were written impeccably, providing very cool scenes.In the end (without spoilers) Ex Machina manages to somehow impact the audience, the question is whether, for better or for worse. In my opinion, the last 10 minutes of the film raises a valid questioner, and a legal subject even to discuss, but it is still bizarre, and somewhat torturous (a personal opinion, of course, this may be up to the goal of Movie, though).In summary: If you are a supporter of this technology, Ex Machina will most likely become one of your favorite movies. If not, the production is still a good movie, with undeniable defects, qualities also undeniable, and a large part remaining, which is in charge of the individual taste of each.",7,0,1,8 February 2017
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," An history that will make you think
","At first, I wasn't giving that much for this movie, I was like 'oh, ok, it's a history where the main character is born old and get younger every day, but, what can you do with it?', and, omg, the movie is surprisingly good!The movie brings a cool message about life, that makes you think a lot about how you deal with your life, or how you had so much good things, but doesn't give them the attention that they really deserve. That is certainly the most amazing thing about the movie, it make you rethink almost everything that you do.The script is well done, the mix with the history line in the present give us something else to care about, besides the history of Benjamin Button (I just dont get it whats the relevence of the hurricane, but ok), and also tells his history in a clever way. At the beggining it bother me a little bit, but after a while it engages.The cast is really really good. Of course, Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt are the biggest highlight, both are amazing in the roles, but the supporting cast is also very good.The only main issue that I have with the movie is the CGI in some parts, mostly in the scenes where Benjamin is 'young' (or old, I don't know), look, I know that it's hard to do something like that, make a person that at the same time that is young is old to, but, sadly, for me the CGI take you out of the movie in the beggining, but that is it, I think that with one hour of movie, is alredy Brad Pitt there, just with make up (that by the way, is AMAZING).In short, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a great film, with amazing direction and photography, some really great actors, and certainly worth your time.8,5/10",8,0,0,23 December 2017
1917," This is why I love cinema
","I'm so glad I got to see this in theaters.I love how the movie is immersive, and it uses the 'one shot' thing to be even more immersive, you feel like you are in the middle of WWI, alongside the two main characters. That's my favorite aspect of it. And isn't being immersive what a movie's goal is in the first place?And man, the sequences throughout the film are insanely great. I believe the main example is towards the end where Sco has to run through a whole army that's running in the other direction, it's of the best and most suspenseful sequences of the year. A bit before that, there is another great sequence, that's just gorgeous, with the flare guns, and bombs lighting up the sk, while Sco runs and people shot at him.The cinematography as a whole is outstanding, Roger Dickerson is really one of the (if not the) best cinematographer working today. It's beautiful.The acting is really good as well, George MacKay is the heart and soul of the movie. Dean-Charles Chapman is also really good. And some great 'cameos' of more known actors throughout the movie are also really entertaining, and they give solid performances. Like Benedict Cumberbatch, Richard Madden, Mark Strong, and Andrew Scott.The movie is is emotional, thrilling, and gorgeous at the same time, and the score is great.Anyways, to sum up, I freaking love the movie, it's one of the best war films I've ever seeing, it's my favorite 2019 movie, and truly an unique experience to have in a movie theater. There is not a better way to describe it than saying that it made me remember why I love cinema. And that's 100% true.",10,10,16,5 February 2020
Mission: Impossible II," Way too serious
","I'll make this short. If the movie was what the last 25 minutes are, it would be perfect (in a weird way). But sadly, it is not.I think that the main problem of MI2 is that it take itself too serious, like, two guys jump from their bikes and collide with each other IN THE F# AIR, but you also are supposed to be worried about a global virus that will destroy the world. And you just don't buy it.But there are also a lot of shitty things here, the romance between Ethan and Nyah happened so fast, the guy is literally risking his life for her, after one night (or less).The soundtrack is sometimes a real mess, you go to some mexican type of music in some scenes (with no-sense at all) to some heavy metal type of music in another one. And it just don't fit for the majority of the time.And, ok, we have to talk about the slow-mo, look, Matrix is fantastic, amazing, but the bunch of crap that came after it is surreal. It seems like the director just saw Matrix and thought 'we have to put more slow-mo in the movie! It will be great!'. But, well... no. A lot of scenes you can notice that they were clearly shoot with normal cameras, and slowled in pos.Tom Cruise is amazing in the film when the subject is action scenes. The guy let they hold a KNIFE above his eyes! The dude is a monster, really. He's stunt's are by far the best thing in the whole movie.Well, in short, Mission: Impossible II it's really not a great film (in fact, it's bad), but the last 30 minutes of it are very watchable (you can search for it on YT if you really want to see), the rest of it is almost everything just boring, way over the top, but yet, very serious about it's crazy plot.",3,2,5,8 February 2018
Logan," Poorly crafted elements make Logan not reach its full potential
","A good movie.Some productions are marked by their bold style, heavy thematic, and etc, and are remembered and exalted by these same characteristics, when reminded by movie buffs around the world, in casual discussions.Logan will certainly be remembered like this. The film delivers a magnificent action, exploring for the first time the real potential of Wolverine in this regard, as well as bringing a new type of approach to hero films, with a weight, a reality, and a seriousness that make until the story turns off almost That completely of the own kind of superhero.But even picking up on the action, the 'dirty' story and the performance of the actors, with Hugh Jackman and especially Patrick Stewart impeccable and 100% committed to roles, Logan points out in other points that would be even easier to correct Than the others in which the film succeeded, which makes it not reach the potential that had, and even being a farewell worthy of Hugh Jackman of the paper, is that thought that could have been better.In order to exemplify (without spoilers), two points that are very badly used within the narrative, and that end up taking a little concentration of the viewer at the time of the film, are, first of all, the misuse of the villains of the film, the Reavers, who At first they give the impression that they are going to be a great force in the course of history, but at some point they are taken from focus, and never really put to the test.And finally, what has bothered me the most, and even caused a certain shame, is a 'narrative element' used at some point in the film, where it is necessary to explain a certain thing, and this is done in the most superficial way, played And possible whimper that makes you even want to laugh. If you saw the movie, you know what I'm talking about, and if you did not see it, when you see it, you'll remember what I said.In summary: Logan is a good movie, delivers definitely incredible moments, talks about family, shows a Wolverine loaded with anguish and regrets, but sins in moments, being kind of a 'roller coaster', going from 'heaven to hell' in Few minutes, but fortunately, good times still stand out from the bad.",8,1,5,5 March 2017
The Mummy Returns," The last 30 minutes of the movie are amazing (for all the wrong reasons)
","I have fun watching the movie, again. I think that, funny enough, here you feel more the dated CGI than in the 1999 film (cof cof Scorpion King cof cof). I'm totally analyzing this movie through a whole different perspective tho.First, the good stuff. I like the first 1/3 of the movie for real, the scenes in the tombs and in London are cool, some good scenes, and that fight with the Mummy on the bus is great. I like Evelyn a whole lot more this time around, she is a badass, even though I still not shipping them as a couple. She at least isn't totally helpless.Again, Fraser is great as the lead. And at first, I didn't like the kid, but afterwards I loved his chemistry with his uncle. The movie definitely goes for a more comic tone than the first one.Right when they meet the balloon guy, the movie lost me a bit. Here we have some truly bad CGI moments (with the night sky, and also the part at the lake with the face). And man, that whole Evelyn is actually a reincarnation too was horrible. This and the whole 'I have a tattoo that says something' stuff with Rick is just bad, and used as a reason to tie everything together (but did we really need this?). The next 1/3 of the movie lost me again. Also, where was this reincarnation of Anck Su Namun in the first movie? C'mon, don't do that. Everything here goes against what they did in the first movie.The third act tho. My god the third act. I love everything about it (mostly the last 30 minutes). But for all the wrong reasons. Of course, the kid resurrects his mom! Anck Su Namun leaves Imhotep to die lmao. And MY GOD the Scorpion King! I love every minute he's on screen. Is so bad, but so damn entertaining. And of course, who didn't see the ex machina factor coming a mile away at the end?This is by no means a better film than The Mummy (1999), it manages to have some truly awful CGI (and being known for it) even tho it was released 2 years after the original. However, the first 30/40% of the movie are good, the next 30/40% are bad, but the last 20/30% are freaking awesome, the big fight scene with a CGI The Rock against young Brendan Fraser. I can't wait to watch The Scorpion King.",5,0,1,7 June 2020
Mission: Impossible," Definitely a milestone in the action/suspense genre (but is not perfect)
","Sometime ago I realize that I never saw the first Mission Impossible Trilogy, two years ago I saw Rogue Nation and loved, so I'm looking forward to see the rest of the movies.Well, this movie is great, is definitely different than the sequels that we're getting now, but is without doubt one movie that influence a dozen of other action movies and franchises. The suspense through the entire movie is great, the surprises on the script really caught me off guard. The death of all Ethan's crew, the fact that Jim is the asshole at the end, and not the CIA boss. By the way, I love the way that DePalma shows us that Ethan knows the true, the scene is just gorgeous. I think that overall the actors are very good here, only Emmanuelle Béart didn't sound good sometimes. The most of the action scenes are truly breathless, in fact, that aren't a lot of 'ordinary action scenes' (like two guys fighting), the director choose to do something that relies on the suspense itself, to leave you breathless. The heist scene is great, the soundless fact was a really clever idea.Overall, I think that my only big issues with the movie are the dated aspects. Like, why they have to use Chroma Key on the scene that are inside a car? Just, why?The internet aspect isn't a real issue, but is funny to see the perception they have of it. And the train scene is probably my big issue, does not hold up well, I get the time that it was made and all that kind of stuff, but just doesn't hold up, and, with that, I think that the weight that it was supposed to have didn't work for me. It's still a good action scene, all the 'air' aspect is great, but, the CGI degrees its grade. Oh, I almost forget it: The score! My god the score! This is probably the most iconic thing of the franchise, and it is amazing, one of the best action movies score.Overall, Mission Impossible is a great movie, that definitely inspires (till today) a lot of action directions, such as Bourne Identity and Matrix. Worth your time.7,5/10",7,0,0,5 February 2018
Les Misérables," Surprisingly incredible and sentimental
","I confess that I got surprised in the first 15 minutes of the movie, when at no time did the actors stop singing for 'normal lines', I had never seen a movie with that format.So I say that the feature film is surprisingly good, even if it seems strange at first.In at least three moments in the story I really was prone to crying (Anne Hathaway simply destroys her role, even though she appears a little bit lightly) and this is something that does not happen often when I watch movies.The plot brings a sad story that at the same time criticizes ancient times of humanity, but can also be understood as a parallel with the world today.The actors are all incredibly good in their roles, both in acting and singing. Maybe my only problem with the film is its duration, in several moments I stopped to look at how much time was left to finish, not enough to be annoying, but if I had a half hour more it could be more easily accessible.",9,9,12,26 July 2017
The Shape of Water," One of the weirdest movies that I ever saw (but this is not a bad thing)
","Ok, The Shape of Water definitely isn't a movie for the big public, it's incredibly weird (as almost every Del Toro movie), and unusual, but at the same time it can pass a beautiful and complex message about love.Before talking about the movie as a whole, I need to point some fantastic aspects of it. The acting is very good, Sally Hawkins and Octavia Spencer (as you may already know) shine in the movie, and their nominations are undoubtably deserved, but Michael Shannon also shows again that he is a freaking monster, he once again destroys in the role. I really think that he deserved at least a Oscar nomination here (probably more than Richard Jenkins, that is also very good, but not as good as Shannon).The cinematography and the photography is gorgeous, Del Toro shows us once again that he is one of the most unique directors working today, the guy has a style, and it shines here.Talking about that, Del Toro direction is freaking amazing too, everything is beautiful, the actors are shining, the guy will probably won the Oscar tonight, and it will be deserved.And, of course, the overall message of the movie, the prejudice, the feeling that some have, that they are alone in the world, how hard it is for some people to find love, and how painful it is for those who end up never finding. And is really fantastic how Del Toro is able to talk about such subjects with a movie about a big fish monster that make love with a woman.Really, think about it, what were the odds of this end up been just a creepy and laughable movie? The concept sounds extremely cheesy but the final result is fantastic.All the visual effects also are fantastic, and the movie does not had a big budget, so, is another achievement here.Probably the only issue that I can have with the movie is that in some point it seems like it's going to end without a climax, but it kinda 'forces' somethings to happen, in order to have a 'big finally confront', you know, it doesn't make the movie less great, but was what prevented the movie to be a 10/10 to me. I think that they also could have given more time to the build of the relationship between the Fish and Elisa, overall you buy it, but it feels a little bit rushy.Well, in short, The Shape of Water is a great piece of work by Guillermo Del Toro, has a beautiful and powerful message, that is told in a unique and odd way. Another great movie from the 2018 Oscar's, right now I saw 7/9 from the Best Picture Nominees, and just one was under the 8/10 grade.",9,65,124,4 March 2018
Mudbound," A tough one to grade
","This was one of the most difficult grades that I ever gave on IMDb. It's really hard to rate the movie, and I'll try to say why here.Let's start from the top, I really love the overall message that the movie wants to pass, the prejudice, the bad things that humankind it's willing to do sometimes, but also, that there are good people out there, into the mud and the durst. Anyway, this is what I love about the movie, I love the way that it approaches the subject, you fell for all the color characters that are on screen, you want to step up, and fight for them, you fell rage for the KKK a-holes, and a lot of other feelings. In this subject (the message one) the movie is great, thrilling, and engaging. However...In my opinion the biggest flaw of the movie is his need to give everyone a voice (littery a voice, they have narration moments), and does not work. Look, I'm not a hater of narration on movies, I think that if they are used in the right way, they work, but here they overuse this style, and with half away of the runtime you're just tired to hear someone pop up and talking about their feeling every 5 minutes. And is also confusing at times, the pacing of the editing.The movie is also really boring at times, mainly when Jason Clarke's character is on screen, you just don't care about him, his family or anything like that. And this happens probably because they don't do anything special when they are on screen.On the other hand, the acting here is amazing, everyone is great on the roles especially Jonathan Banks (you truly hate the character), Garrett Hedlund and Rob Morgan. The score is very good also.In short, Mudbound is a movie that worth see it, approaches a tough subject, that we must not forget that happened, and change our mindset, in order to ensure that this behavior stops (because this continues to happen, in other forms, till this day). The movie fails on some editing, pacing and screenplay perspective, but, the overall message stills strong.",6,5,14,21 February 2018
Joker," A fanboy's struggle to grade a movie
","I have so many mix feelings about it. I'm gonna start from the begging tho. Since the first rumor that this movie was even a possibility my initial thought (one that I held until weeks before the release) was: Ok, DC is lost, this is just a terrible idea by all means possible. My line of thought was: My favorite aspects of the Joker character are by far the fact that you do not know why he is what he is (I mean, The Killing Joke isn't the definitive answer to Joker's origin, just isn't, you see what I mean here), he is just an agent of chaos, the perfect opposite for Batman, and in his mindset Batman is only 'a bad day away' from becoming the Joker, and this what he tries to prove over and over again. So that's one thing, I was scared that the movie would try to answer thing we do not need to be answer.A perfect parallel for me was the Han Solo movie, since the beginning sounded like a bad idea, at the end, I didn't think the movie was bad, it's entertaining enough, just didn't need to be 'A Han Solo movie', actually the worst parts of it are the ones that they give us answers to questions that we truly didn't need an answer for (the name scene, geeez). The difference here is, that Han Solo was far from being my favorite Star Wars character, actually my biggest regret with all that is that would never see an Obi-Wan movie due to the box office failure of Solo (now we are getting a series, so, it's better than nothing). But the Joker... man, he is one of my favorite villains ever. The 'bat-verse' is by far my favorite thing in the superhero world, that being movies, tv shows, comics etc. So I was genuinely concern they would screw the character up doing a movie.Well, at the end, one thing I can say for sure is that they didn't. The movie isn't bad. And the fact I can barely write this without being confused by my own thoughts shows that. But my second concern was (and this one kind of still holds up) that for me (that's my perspective on the joker character tho, not a universal rule) Batman and the Joker exist almost in 'harmony', one can be fully himself without the other, mainly the Joker. I gonna get more into that in a minute, but upfront my main issue with the whole thing is my struggle in evaluating the movie as its own thing. My fanboy side just can't shut up. So that's for me it's probably the reason why I would never give this movie a 10/10, in my mind that isn't necessarily the Joker, it's a version of it, sure, but the real one couldn't be fully himself without the Bat.That being said tho. They did a heck of a job in changing my mind on the movie being a bad an idea. I have never thought I would live to see an adaptation of a DC/Marvel character into an art film. And that's 100% what Joker is, it's a freaking Oscar film, based on the batverse (!!!) character, that's insane. This in one of the hopes I have, that we won't be stuck into the 'Marvel Formula' forever in superhero movies, and therefore, we will have variations within the genre going forward. Cause, no mater how you feel about any of the recent superhero films, having different adaptations of different characters is the best-case scenario ANY comic book fan can hope for. To there is that. Talking about the movie itself, it manages to go deep into this character mind, and, as Nolan did with Batman almost fifteen years ago, sort of puts the character into a 'believable world'. 'What if the Batman/Joker existed in the real world?' and explores that concept without any of the comic's suspension of disbelief.That's the struggle I have tho, I know the movie is supposed to be its own thing (and to me the ending was sort of: Did it really happened? Or was he just dreaming about it the whole time? And the best thing about it is that there isn't a definitive answer, and that in a way emanates what the Joker is. Caos. Confusion), but even tho the execution is good, I can't fully put behind the fact that I believe that Batman-Joker relationship is deeply important in any story you may tell about either.I know this is sounding confusing af so far. But the main point I'm trying to make here is that the movie is indeed great, and I was wrong for thinking it was a bad idea. However, some of my concerns I had upfront were proved valid (in my opinion), and I still think that the fact that this origin story doesn't have the Batman doesn't quite fit with the image I have of the character. And also, before I forget, that aside, the plot with the Waynes was something I truly thought was misplaced, I can't see it as more than a fan service, you cloud have putted any other billionaire that and the movie would have worked just fine (or even better). If you aren't making the connection with Batman, fine, just don't make the connection, don't try to give me a 'half-way through it' solution, that's worst.Well, if you read until here (first of all, why? Haha), thanks. But to sum up, Joker is an art film of a DC comics character, and I hope it's something that changes forever the superhero genre, and moves it forward, with more options besides the (great) 'Marvelish' movies we have been seeing for the past 10 years. Joaquin Phoneix is great, and it would be insane if he doesn't get an Oscar nomination (at least!). He holds the movie big time, and I can't imagine anyone else in this specific role in this movie. I hope that don't make a sequel tho, and try to build a new universe after it. It holds up, and its better qualities are the fact that it takes risks and try to be a 'what if...' scenario, continuing to tell his story may be a huge mistake (well, what do I know anyways right).I may edit this text at some point in the future after re-watching. I know that it seems like I'm bashing the movie, but I'm not, I just have m reasons to not give it a 10/10, even though it may deserve something around that if I was able to look at it without my fanboy eyes. Sadly, I cannot. If you can, you probably enjoyed way more than I did, and thought about only the things the movie really wanted you to. That's fine, as long as we don't make a huge deal about it, and just move on with our lives.8,5/10",8,1,1,6 January 2020
"Hail, Caesar!"," A funny and clever satire about the film industry
","A great movie.Within this medium of feature films, almost every year we see many satires, parodies, that use references of other works or situations to build their, always around, jokes about such work.In this, we almost always see productions that may even be funny, but in 99% of cases they are just that, with no other 'layer' behind everything, and 'Hail, Caesar!' Is not one of those cases!The story of the film basically shows 'one day behind the scenes of a studio,' with a parody of various elements of the film industry, from the life of a producer, decisions made within a studio, and how they can influence the future of production , And etc, always with an intelligent humor, that at the same time makes fun of the situation, showing them in an exaggerated way, also makes a criticism.Stuffed with great actors, the performances of the film dispense with comments, with impeccable direction at that point, and a script, which, as I said above, is intelligent and very well written.In summary: 'Hail, Caesar!' It's a great movie. Smart and funny. And it portrays in the form of satire the backstage of the world of cinema, as well as exploring countless clichés (like communist villains) from the industry's own films ever since, in order to make jokes yes, but also in a way to say something to About it.",9,0,4,27 February 2017
Kong: Skull Island," A perfect blockbuster made for the big audience!
","I've seen some people complaining about the poor character building of the movie, that's very likely a fact, the characters in this movie are not overly worked and exploited, but why the f#ck is that necessary?The whole movie is built to show the Island, and what exactly is hidden there. There are at least 5 characters there that can be considered 'mainstream' in the story, as it would be humanly possible to approach all the past (or whatever those people want) from them, and still feature Kong and the other monster on the Island without making it a Transformers movie? At less think about that, before starts hate the film (It's like Rogue One, the main character of the movie isn't a real character, but the whole universe that they live).Anyway, for me the movie focuses on what's really important. The characters are not empty bags just waiting to be killed, they just do not have their background stories explored, but you can see a chemistry between the group, a friendship between the soldiers, some sense of danger in the middle of it all. And above all, the story goes on in a line so straightforward and cool, with incredible action scenes, and others that simply fill your eyes with such beauty.The sense of adventure is also something very present there, and that accompanies the whole story and makes it an excellent experience. About the effects, only one or two scenes in the whole movie come to bother, and seem to laugh a little, in a way, other than that, the CGI is almost perfect.In short, Kong is an extremely entertaining film, which makes two hours look like 20 minutes, a story that plays its part in presenting the big gorilla again in theaters and being a flawless blockbuster, which easily serves as an excellent pastime.PS: I can't wait to see King Kong vs Godzilla!",8,0,2,28 June 2017
Marriage Story," Just amazing
","I loved the movie. I don't need to say much about it, the movie is great. Is great directed, it has an awesome score, an amazing screenplay, and two insanely good performances. That's the main highlight for me tho, besides all the other great stuff, Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson just kill it in the movie.My God, they are such talent actors, and they give them all here. I've been following Adam's career since he got cast as Kylo Ren, and I have yet to see a movie where he isn't good in it, the guy is a freaking monster. I think is fair to say I've seen less of Scarlett's work besides the Marvel films, but still, I know she is great for movies like Hail, Cesar, or Her for example. Anyways, the point is they are both insanely great in the movie.What helps both actors is that characters are incredible well written, they feel like real people, with flaws, and the movie takes its time to let you know them, see their side of the story, and that helps a lot, the material they have to work with is great.One thing that I didn't see a lot of people talking about is the score. Man, I love almost every musical bit in the movie (besides one of the last fell ones, that's actually performed by Adam Driver, which a thought was... weird, at best). The score overall is flawless tho. It adds a lot to the movie itself.I talk to a friend about it, and he said he thought the movie didn't have a 'message', besides showing kind of how a marriage process works. I disagree tho. I think the movie's main message it's not exactly about that, I think the movie shows how connected your life is to another person when you married, and consequently, how difficult is to 'disconnect', and mainly, that love is... weird, and it doesn't need vanish, after the divorce, you had a strong feeling for that person at one point, and she/he was a crucial part of your life, you'll probably still feel something afterwards, some form of love... and that's beautiful!Idk, I haven't been married at this point, so I guess I'm not the most adequate person to talk about the subject, regardless, that was my take on it.9,5/10",9,5,7,4 January 2020
Black Panther," Definitely one of the most important movies of recent years
","I think that the only thing that will damage the social impact, and the relevance of Black Panther would be if the movie sucked, but it doesn't, so, this is one of the most important movies of recent years, side by side with Wonder Woman, is definitely a message to the world 'The times are changing!', and man, this is so great, I really love that movement, and I get emotional with every new color kid story that I read, about how the movie was important to them, this is just fantastic, and is what the movie industry was supposed to be like.Well, that topic aside, I will talk about just the movie now. I will be honest here, is not one of my favorite Marvel movie of all time, in fact, I think that has more problems than the majority of them. First the great things about it, everyone is talking about, but I have to say: Michael B. Jordan is fantastic on the movie, is definitely one of the best MCU villains by far (he doesn't have that much of a competition, but is ok). You understand his character, you buy his motivation, sometimes you even think that he has a better point than the real hero (even though he is a murderer and etc). I love the character, and the way that the movie builds him.The soundtrack is really good to. I love the 'world-building' of Wakanda, you also buy what they say, that is almost an alien country that was here the whole time. Almost all the Wakanda character are good, you like them (T'Challa's sister, the Doramilages, even T'Challa himself). Buut, some aspects does not work, like T'Challa, I don't know man, I just can't like that much about him, I don't know if is the performance (Chadwick Boseman is not the most charismatic person in the world), I just really don't give that much s**t about him (in fact, Michael B. Jordan character is much more likeable). The fight scenes are also a big issue that I have with the movie, most of them are with really really short lights, and you almost doesn't see anything, the cuts also are very brusque, just the Cassino scene doesn't have that issue. The CGI is also something that bother me a lot, there so much in it! (And when I say that, I know that the majority of the superhero movies have that, but the thing is, that when they are good, you just don't notice - like the first Avengers) But here, my god, the final fight is almost like a big budget video game cutscene (and is also very dark again).Well, in short, even though Black Panther isn't the greatest superhero movie of all time, it's without a doubt one of the most important of all time, it's a time changer, an I really hope that a generation will be inspire by its message, that is highly important, and needs to be listen. It has some flaws, it's far from Marvel's best, but, also like WW, it's overall a good movie, and this is enough to not damage its importance.",7,0,2,25 February 2018
Toy Story 3," OMG! I can not believe it took me 7 years to see this movie!
","Just like virtually every child born in the 90's, I obviously saw the first two Toy Story, however I was never a 'hardcore' fan of the movies, I always found it very cool, but it was not super fan, so much so that in 2010 when Toy Story came out, I at the height of my thirteenth year did not even want to know about watching the movie in theaters (I still had not learned to appreciate a good film work). 7 years later I finally saw Toy Story 3 and... GOSH! It's AMAZING!The story can go from moments when you get really tense, to others extremely funny or super exciting! This is definitely one of Pixar's greatest assets, they have revolutionized animation films in such a way, and even today they are miles ahead of their competitors, with animations that still are made for children but may well be appreciated by all the ages.The script of the film may at times be 'predictable' (you know, they will not all die in the end), but still the story surprises you in many ways and in small points that at first seem only 'thrown' in the plot that you really realize the genius of what they are doing.Just to give an example, I'll list some of them:(1) Woody being found by the little girl we initially saw in the nursery. (2) Woody be taken to the little house and see the address of it. (3) Woody just know that the daycare bear is bad because he went to her house. (4) And when we finally think that little bow is no longer useful, Woody writes the little girl's determination on paper for Andy, so they are donated to her. ... (5) And one more. Because she spent a night and played with him, she shows that she wants Woody, and only then does Andy accept giving he to her, without which Woody would eventually go to college with Andy and not stay with her friends at the end.In addition to all this, especially for those who grew up watching the franchise's films, the end of the film is wonderful and sentimental, representing in a certain way the public itself, given the 15 years that separate 'Toy Story' from 'Toy Story 3', the audience of the first films grew up with Andy and it's even cooler to think that a child who was taken to the movies by his parents in 1995 can bring his own son in 2010! It's really amazing.In summary, Toy Story 3 is a masterpiece of Pixar, closing with gold key this great trilogy of films. After seeing it, I even wanted to review the other two films, I have not seen it in a long time!P.s: The Brazillian Soundtrack is AMAZING! (I didn't see the original).",10,0,0,18 July 2017
Jojo Rabbit," Good, but it could have been more
","I had a really bad experience watching this movie in the theater, not related to the movie itself, just that the power went off three times in the screening room, and it delayed the whole thing almost 40 minutes. Still, I'm trying by best to not consider that on my thoughts about the movie, I'm truly trying to be impartial, but I get that maybe my overall feel of the movie might have been influenced by the experience I had watching it. So, just wanna to put that disclaimer out there.Starting with the good stuff, the acting in the movie is great, Roman Griffin Davis is really really good in the movie, as is his friend in the movie Archie Yates, this movie is for both young actors their first credit hole in anything according to IMDb, so, this is a hell of a start for both of them. Taika is also fantastic in it, even though he doesn't have as many scenes I thought he had in the movie. Scarlett Johansson is also good here, even though I don't quite get the Oscar nomination.I love the cinematography, is a beautifully shot film, and it kind of has an 'Wes Andersonish' style to it.Besides those aspects tho, the best aspect of the movie is the comedy, the movie is so much funny in multiple times. Even though most of the time, the movie is dealing with some truly f-up stuff it gets away with a bunch of stuff by passing by it with a joke and getting a life out of you, even though you shouldn't laugh at it.This satire aspect of it all is especially funny at first, but it short of loses it a bit when the movie goes on. I felt like it got coming back to most of the 'themes' to joke about that it had already joked about.And at the end, I felt like it didn't balance the comedy/satire aspect with the dramatic part of it. Things happen, like Jojo's mother death, that could potentially be a huge turning point, and focal point going towards the end, but it doesn't really impact his life that much. Even though the scene where he discovers her death is gorgeously executed, without even showing her face, the death itself doesn't impact as much as it should in Jojo's overall story.And I know that most of it is supposed to be an over the top satire, that shows how bad Nazism was, and how screwed people were at the end of it all because of it. And that's fine, however, the movie isn't all an over the top satire, it has its 'down to earth' moments, and because of those moments, when something that would truly impact the life of our 10 years old protagonist happens (namely his mother passing away), you kind expects that it will be approached in a certain way, and it isn't.So the ending itself, even though it's beautiful with the 'dance' callback, feels like of empty, like if they could have done more, and evolve Jojo's character a bit more. Again, I love the satire part of it, and how it does a critic of something as bad as Nazism, by making you laugh at it, but I felt like something was missing at the end, and they could have gone further with the story.To sum up, Jojo Rabbit is a good movie, that deals with a really serious subject with a light and funny approach, it's clearly meant to be an over the top satire, but at the end, I felt like it could have gone further in exploring something that were settled up before, and developing its protagonist even more.",7,6,11,5 February 2020
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Depending on what you seek to watch this movie may be worth it. Or not.
","Animation (2/2): The animation is fantastic, at the same time it can be awkward (in a good way) and extremely full of details. At this point the movie lives up to the style of stop motion animation masterfully.Soundtrack (2/2): The track is great, each song fits perfectly into their respective scene.Acting/Direction (1.5 / 2): All the voice actors are OK, there isn't much to point out here, they neither hurt nor make the movie extraordinary. Wes Anderson's direction is interesting, with a peculiar filming style, with one or another scene coming out of the status quo. A good direction, of a good director.History (0,5 / 2): From the beginning the film try to present us with a very basic story, this is certainly not a problem, even with other animations already showing us that it is possible to do something aimed at children but adults can also watch and perceive small hidden elements behind the story. See Toy Story 3, Inside Out and etc. But even the simple 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' seems to fail to do, some points take you out of the story (ex: If from the beginning he was good at digging, why was not his first plan already?). Perhaps a small positive point here is the sense of adventure, which is present and can entertain children.Comedy (0/2): Here is probably where the movie lost me. After all, what's the point of seeing a comedy that isn't funny? And I don't say that because no scene made me cry with laughter, I say this because I didn't find any scenes if you want funny, the movie fails miserably in this matter, definitely this is not a funny movie.6/10",6,1,1,6 August 2017
The Matrix," Definitely a milestone in film history
","Another classic that I took a lot of time to see, and damn, I could not be more regretful.The Matrix is ​​definitely one of the most important films in history, even today, almost 20 years after the special effects still hold, and especially the fight scenes, are incredible, wonderful, and magnificent.The story is frighteningly believable, and this is certainly one of the foundations of the franchise's success. I think there is not much to talk about, it's worth even more an addendum inside the fight scenes: Keanu Reeves is fantastic. It's so beautiful to see a fight scene without lots of cuts and blurs, it makes all the difference and makes it as close to the real as possible, and besides the director's merit this is definitely the actor's merit too, and everyone here knows that Reeves does almost all his fight scenes, trying his hardest, and that's not for now (John Wick), The Matrix is ​​here to prove it.My only problem with the movie is the 'Snow White Moment' in the end, they would have had thousands of better ways of solving that scene and for me it spoiled the impact.In summary, it's a fantastic movie.",9,0,1,26 July 2017
Looper," Why I took so long to see this movie?!!
","The idea of this movie is incredible, also execution of it, in fact, everything with this film it's amazing.Starting with the concept, I never saw something like that in other media, maybe there is something like that, but unless, I didn't now any, so the movie improve even more.Some movies has amazing ideas, but fail on the execution. That's not the case here. The structure of it works since the beginning, when the editing is use to explain in a gradual way all the things that you need to know, while set some pieces that will be very useful in the future. Amazing script, amazing direction, amazing editing.The cast is terrific too. Joseph Gordon-Levitt simply destroys in the main role, I think I never had seeing him on a action role (or something like that) so it was a very good surprise for me. Bruce Willis is awesome too, Emily Blunt, Paul Dano, you know, the cast is fantastic. Another performance that deserves to be honor is the little kid, Pierce Gagnon, who plays Cid. Every time that he spoke I was like 'WOW', you know, there's no big deal about the role, but he is thinking to sound like a little genius guy, and it works very well! He had like 8 years at the time? Less? I don't know, but really impress me. Well, and this is another point to the directing of Rian Johnson, good performance of the whole cast, almost always has the 'finger' of a good director.Maybe the only thing that someone can say about the movie is some 'cliches' that it may fall into. Like, you know that 'Blue Kid' will do some dumb thing and screw up in some point, you get very fast too that the kid is the rainmaker, but come on! It's fine, it's almost impossible do some kind of film, book or anything else without something like that, it's impossible be 100% unpredictable this days, and besides that, I was always thinking that I knew what is going too happening next, but I almost always was wrong.In short, Looper is a fantastic movie, I can't recommend you more too see it. And OMG I'm EVEN MORE EXCITED FOR THE LAST JEDI NOW! But seriously, I'm can't wait to see more of Rian Johnson's movies, this was my first one, and I'm already a fan.9,5/10",9,6,10,12 November 2017
Green Book," Great, and touching story
","Loved the movie. The performances are outstanding shout out to Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, the dudes are amazing. The story is powerful, and talks about a very tough issue (similar to BlacKkKlansman, but in a 'subtle' way), but it's done with such careful, and in a gradative pace.The way their relationship is build throughout the movie is great. I love the way they kind of make a parallel between the characters, and how Viggo's is 'blacker' than Ali's (explicit saying that at one point). Talking about that scene in specific, this might be my favorite scene in a movie all year. The build up for it is perfect, and man, Ali's performance is phenomenal, he truly delivered it. You feel for the character, you realize that he has no one in his life, he is curse to never be 100% a part of any social group he might find on society, and outcast. What a scene.The only issue I had with the movie, is just about one plot point. In the beginning we see a scene where Tony throws to cups in the trash can, because to black man drank water on it. So you think 'ok, the dude is pretty racist', but this is not exactly an issue throughout the movie. Actually, 20 minutes after, he is playing games with some black guys outside the first club Don performed on. The only scene when this kind of gets between them, is briefly in the scene when he comes back to the car to get his wallet and goes to pee. But overall, he's pretty ok with Don since the beginning. Anyways, doesn't exactly makes the movie bad, and it something you forgot halfway throughout it, but still, it something I believe is a inconsistency into the script.Overall, I loved Green Book, is a strong and incredibly well made movie, who deserves his Oscar nomination. I highly recommend it.",9,2,4,23 February 2019
John Wick: Chapter 2," John Wick - Chapter 2: He REALLY is the Batman with guns this time!
","Let's say the bunch of good things first, and after I tell some little issues that I have with the movie.The soundtrack is GREAT! Really, I mean, John's theme song is one of the most bad-ass track's I ever see. Right on the beginning of the movie there is a wonderful scene, with bad-ass fight's, and all that stuffs that we want in a action movie, and the track plays a big role on that.I said that for the first one, I said that for Matrix, and I will keep saying that for every action movie that Keanu Reeves do it: HE IS A GENIUS! OMG, really, the guy simple destroys in every action scene of the movie, and is so satisfying to see a good action scene, that is film in the right way, without a billion of cuts! It's really so good to see. Well, besides that, I really think that the first movie had more memorable scenes (like that one on the club), there isn't one specific scene of this one that people will talk forever or something like that. Buut, even though, there are a lot great scenes, with great 'OMG! WTF!?' moments, like when he KILLS A GUY WITH A PENCIL! Or shoot in other guy's balls! The action scenes are undoubtedly the best thing of this franchise.I really don't have much to say about the actors, on the dialogues part, they are, in the majority, fine. Keany Reeves, as we already know, is the best bad actor out there, so, he's fantastic once again. The main villain, I mean, is 'fine' too, i don't know, the guy didn't convince myself. The only one that I really thought was great is Ian McShane (he's by far the best actor in the main cast, so that isn't a surprise I think).There are some silly things about the movie that I think that some people might find it annoyed. Like, HOW IN THE HELL can a guy be a good hit-man if EVERYBODY KNOWS HIM?! Kkkkkkkkk, well, but this doesn't take away the shine of the movie to me at all. In fact, I really thought it was funny for the majority of the time, so I enjoy it a lot (it's like every time that he leaves a place, someone has to say 'good hunting, Mr. Wick' or something like that. Literally, EVERY TIME! A M A Z I N G !).Now, seriously, it's seen to me that they really get out of the box on this movie, and kind of change the vibe of the franchise (well, this time he is really a fusion of the Batman and the Punisher. Literally, there is a scene that he use's his suit like a Bat-cape, to avoid the shoots. In the first movie, the vibe was kind different, like a underground, and visceral action thriller). But, I think that is fine, will probably be more difficult to build a franchise based of on the first one lonely. I strongly believe that they aren't able to do another one good as the first, but, well, it's OK, isn't? As long as they keep doing good movies (like John Wick 2 is), they will have my money, they doesn't need to do fantastic movies (like 'John Wick') for that.In short, John Wick: Chapter 2 is a great movie, really entertaining, and another lesson to a lot of directors out there of how to shoot action scenes.8,5/10",8,1,2,14 November 2017
Annihilation," Good
","Technically speaking the movie is great. The acting is good, the CGI is awesome, the cinematography is really really good, and etc. It has good questions within it, with my favorite one being what exactly is evil? Cause throughout the whole thing, we see that this isn't a hostile type of alien contact, things are 'evolving' in a certain way inside the shimmer, they are not destroying everything, they are changing it. I love that part.I found hard to care about Portman's character tho, even more when we find out that she has being cheating on her husband.There are other notes I've took throughout the movie, and I just gonna leave them here.At one point she says 'I know what I have to do'. I mean, do you, really? So, do you need to risk your life in this alien-ish thing just cause you cheated on your husband?One issue I have with the movie, is that I feel that it throws a bunch of stuff on the wall, and doesn't answer almost any of them. Like, why don't they remember setting up camp in the beginning? What's the reason for all that part?At the end, I just felt like the alien was really stupid. I mean, dude, haven't seeing fire at ANY POINT in your intergalactical trip? For real? Why would you just lie in the 'roots' (or something) of your hole base in the planet. As almost like it was trying to screw everything up.Also, makes no sense at all that she is an alien at the end.7/10",7,1,3,15 June 2019
Incredibles 2," Man... I just love Pixar!
","I've been wating for this sequence for almost 15 years! And, it's amazing how it whorted. It's incredible (sorry about that) how the whole process of making a film works at Pixar, they just let the creators do their thing in the best way possible, and the result is undeniable, the movies are in 90% of the times, great. And Incredibles 2 is great.Probably the only 'issue' that I may have with the movie is the villan, isn't a strong villan by far, it's some of those cases where in the moment a character enters the scene you know 'ok, future bad guy here'. But, that's it, I don't thing this is something that takes the light out of the movie. The story is clever, the script talks about some current subjects (as always) that anyone can relate to it. It's extremely funny too, great jokes. A real smart popcorn movie.Summing up, Incredibles 2 is a great piece of work, Pixar nails it once again, and probably books the Best Animation Oscar again.",9,1,2,2 July 2018
Coach Carter," A surprisingly emotional and inspiring story!
","I had never heard of this movie before, and I did watch it only because my sister had to watch to do an essay from school, so my expectations were somewhat low. But man, it is really good!It tells a truly emotional story, that touches on extremely sensitive issues, and the fact that it is based on a true story makes it even more powerful. Everything that surrounds the kids that lived in that neighborhood, their families, their social influences, their money problems, and so many other factors would have led to... unfortunate outcomes. And that is something even people who aren't necessarily on situations similar to the characters in the movie can learn from, and try to be more grateful for what they have, and also try to help others as much as they can.Talking about the movie itself, I found it really well written, the acting was great, and it doesn't necessarily feel almost 2 hours and 20 minutes long, which is a plus. Half way through the movie, I checked the time, and saw that we still had more than an hour to go, and... I was glad! I didn't wanna leave those characters yet, and I wanted to see them succeeding.I think tho, that after the first big win (their championship) the pace, that was going so smoothly, kind of struggled a bit, and only after a good 20, 25 minutes it started to pick up again, which is still, fine, I was invested in the characters and entertained. But it can be said as one problem.To sum up, Coach Carter is a great movie, with a touching story, that may make you re-think some important aspects of your own life. You may start think more about inequality, and privileges you didn't realized you had before, which is fine, what counts, is what you do moving forward, the way you approach life, and, if you happen to have any number of privileges, just always be grateful for it, and try to make the best of it, and luckily, in any kind of way, shape or form, you might actually do something that will give another person new opportunities, and so on. In times like this, that's something truly important to keep in mind, and think about on a day to day basis. Let's be grateful for what we have, and help others as much as we can.",8,0,0,30 March 2020
Hacksaw Ridge," Andrew Garfield incredible, and Mel Gibson flawless in the war.
","Great movie. I'm not really sure where to start talking. Hacksaw Ridge is a great film, I was surprised by a direction by Mel Gibson, never seen a production commanded by it, but it shows incredible quality when it comes to portraying a war, with battle scenes being filmed with mastery, showing all the weight and the Horror of the battlefield. Perhaps the only 'negative' points of the direction are attributed to some slow 'unnecessary' movements. I also felt that 'something is missing' in the scenes that start a movie story, and show a family, city and love life of Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) character, but nothing that is extremely bad. Talking about Garfield, the actor is incredible, managing to pass on his character's 'innocence' during the whole movie, making the viewer that this man really would die for his personal belief. Make an analysis of a change, putting a test one more time an ability to do, becoming more 'physical'. In short, the best Spider-Man in the theaters, shows that he has an undeniable talent throughout the film. The story, while not having anything great, is built very well, arresting the audience to the movie pace with certain ease, and thrilled in its 'climax', in addition, all the cast of excellent support, For Hugo Tecendo, but making clear that the rest of the cast delivers what is expected, when necessary. Finally, Hacksaw Ridge shows why he deserves to be among the finalists for the Oscars, make it start to the end, and it's a better cine-biography I've seen, ever since 'Imitation Game.'",8,2,6,4 February 2017
Jurassic Park," Almost 30 years after, and most of it still holds up pretty well
","Seeing the movie now, almost 30 years later, some parts of it definitely didn't age as well as we might have thought it would back then (mostly the shoots of the dinosaurs during the day). However, it's insane, how the movie is still entertaining, after a first half of slow setup and exposition. I get it tho, it would have been impossible to have dinosaurs throughout the whole thing. But even still, I love the element of surprise, and suspense we have until we first see the T-Rex, for example. That scene is incredible, and one of the most memorable scenes in cinema's history.One of the examples of how well the movie holds up: I saw with my family, and my dad (who isn't much of a film guy) was scared as f, in so many scenes! lol That showed me that, if I thought the movie holded up well for most of the time, if the computers didn't tell the age of the film, my family probably would have believed this movie came out in the last 5 years or so. That to me is one of the major proofs of how incredible this movie is, and what it represented back in 1993.That mostly what I have to say about Jurassic Park, it's a great, and fun movie to watch even today. The acting is pretty good (I love Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm). The score... man, the score! I love you John Williams. That's all I'll say.Overall tho, it's undeniable the impact Jurassic Park (as well as other Spielberg's classics) had on movies in general, it was probably one of the first time we saw through CGI (and also a hell of an animatronics job) a brand new world we could almost feel in the screen (since there was almost non-CGI in the first versions of Star Wars, I'm not counting it here, in this example, and also, JP is a story that takes place on Earth, there is an element of fantasy to it, but you can actually see it happening for a moment).From the T-Rex scene, Malcolm's jokes, and Velociraptors opening doors, I loved the second half of the movie. If the first half I thought struggled a bit, the second still flies way high in the sky. A classic.",8,0,0,17 May 2020
The Martian," Beautiful, engaging and funny
","A great movie, scenery and clean effects, very good actors, especially the excellent performance Matt Damon, and lean and coherent script. The Martian might seem just another science fiction film, well, it is rather a film genre, however, is not 'just another', he gets all the credit for innovating in the approach to the subject, differing quite recent successes in this category, rather than trying to follow the realistic mold and serious Interstellar or even the tension and paranoia of gravity, the film is based on completely different bases and behind an engaging story of sci-fi with an excellent mood and that is embedded incredible way within the script, by the way, this is perhaps the greatest asset of the film, it does not come as a comedy, but the good mood prevails throughout most of history which makes it much more engaging to the audience. About the same, the film shows no innovative plot, may be even classified as simple, but even that makes it all even better job, even with a story that you basically know how it will end, you still yes hooks you - you know going back to rescue him, but how? - And in all other respects it never seems forced or without cohesion. The visual effects are excellent as well, leaving the film as a whole extremely 'beautiful.' Matt Damon is fine, giving his charisma character, a sardonic air at various times, dramatic when it is necessary, in addition to appearance changes that show a huge commitment. In short, The Martian is more of a science fiction movie at a time of re-popularization of the genre, but innovating in the approach of its proposal, out of default, has an indisputable success, avoids saturation of this kind of movie and shows that science fiction has much more to give, certainly one of the best 2015 productions.",9,2,4,1 January 2016
The Godfather," If saw this, and thought that isn't good, see it again, cause you saw wrong.
","The first time I had seen 'The Goofather' I thought that was just 'ok' and 'good', I think that my main issue was that the movie was 'too long'. Well, I passed the last 5 years thinking: 'Man, we saw that movie in the wrong way, this isn't possible'. And, yes, I was wrong, and yes, I had seen it wrong.The thing here is, I saw the movie a couple of days now, and I can't thing in a bad thing about it. Really, that isn't one think that seems misplaced or something. The script is fantastic, the movie had a lot time jumps, but you don't get confused, the actors are great (Marlon Brando and Al Pacino mainly), the photography is beautiful, and a lot other things. Well, I really think that isn't much to say here, there wasn't said yet. The Godfather is a real masterpiece.",10,0,0,10 December 2017
