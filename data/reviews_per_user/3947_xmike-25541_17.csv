Blade Runner 2049," I was expecting more
","First movie by Villeneuve which didn't blow me away.. after insomnia or prisoners or arrival he decided to make a scifi sequel which is visually great, perfectly casted but the story itself or more accurately the ending isn't mindblowing, honestly there isn't a thing what you would thinking about after the movie..everything is good but i was really expecting more.",7,3,8,10 October 2017
It," Not so scary for horror fans, but many times funny dialogues
","Classic R movie, where kids swear and its funny. writter put adults jokes into the kids mouths meanwhile horror side of the movie wasn't scary at all.. maybe one two scary moments like bathroom at the girl or whatever.. Only great thing for me was the beginning scene which was portrayed in very good style and without any compromise.. lil bit disappointed tho.",6,0,1,13 October 2017
Wind River," Slow, Quiet, Cold, Nothing New
","I must admit this sh*t is always very tragic.. alcohol, murder, rape and other evil... i feel sorry for those victims but is there any concrete goal by transferring it on the screen ? surely for those victims is totaly taboo, why feel it again.. Jeremy renner perfect as always, Elizabeth Olsen beautiful as always.. Story and the movie offers nothing new in crime/detective thriller.. only for hardcore fans.. watchable only once...",6,0,2,15 December 2017
Us," For me NOT scarry at all, but i get it - its from black director, so hype must be.
","Not saying its bad movie, its really entertaining in SOME points but 2hrs is way too long for horror (intended) flick. I loved and hated the family father. He was funny but in serious and life threatening situations he acted like real teenager boi with weird attitude.
You can read here many very god crfiticial reviews with logical mega holes, funny (unintended) situations, etc. etc.
Weak movie.
Sum up - not worth the hype we have read in recent months.",3,1,1,9 June 2019
Knives Out," Kinda good but Johnson lost his thoughts
","Good one-timer movie with great potential, ruined by poor, usual and boring tools for revelations..Its good family comedy/drama crime story.. Some things and ideas were clichÃ© , some were good and funny.
Certainly its not movie which you will return to every 2 3 4 months like ocean eleven or predator, but it has quality..
Im not the one who trashes Johnson for Last Jedi but i dont think he is some kind of genius either.. Knives Out is very good one-timer with incredible cast and with the most beautiful living thing on the Earth (Ana de Armas).
My problem with this movie is the cheesy , predictable and very usual choice of ending and picking the tools to create final revelation.
The hidden flashbacks are key and its sad (or stupid ?) to decide NOT to show them to audience because you as the viewer cant play along and decifer who is the killer or the bad guy..
The most and second (but the biggest) problem is second half of the story. It derails from solving the murder case and focuses on social drama regarding with money and greed..
I mean i was very saddened how Johnson decided to finish this movie bc it derailed from detective crime comedy/drama to very mediocre and usual stuff with good guy (de Armas) and bad guy (..?..)
Lastly , i blame Johnson to create very stupid and unnecessary political message by trying to say very liberal-ish 'Trump bad, illegal immigrants Good, common sense BAD , socialism Good ) . I mean, almost every movie by those very soft directors MUST annoy the half of audience and losing the touch with reality.",6,1,3,8 June 2020
Deadpool 2," Tons of fun, nice action but still forgettable
","I smiled or laughed few times, it has very much and so many jokes hidden or obvious , that you rly enjoy time spent during watching it.. but i feel it isnt complete movie.. something is missing..only one thing which bothered me is putting reynolds too agressively in every scene, in every dialog.. he steals the show far too often in sense of commenting everything. but forf me, Cable was pretty badass and that prison entrance was pretty huge and cool... definitely ahead of the first movie.. very funny, numerous funny characters (taxi driver, lucky girl or grandma, etc..).
definitely a must see blockbuster which isnt meant to be remembered for too long..",7,1,2,19 May 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Phenomenal drama 9/10
","Suprise of the year so far. Perfect acting from MANY people here , fanstastic story elements crafted scene by scene.. There is no boring second in this film. One thing i dont understand though, is why in Ebbing is practically legal throwing people from the window.. i really didnt understand that nobody even cared to jail Dixon.",9,0,2,5 July 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Not great movie at all.. Great Rami Malek..
","I watched despite im not a Queen listener. I watched it for Rami Malek and he was phenomenal.. The story isnt. Story is safety played with conservative narrative - beginning, boom, success, everything is great, dispute, going solo, life is hard, forgiveness, re-team, end.. This movie isnt meant to be great for non-queen listeners.. For example 8 Mile with Eminem is far more watchable for non-hiphop fans, because the life story is more attractive.. Here, you can see same format ine very scene - Freddy is 'like that', he is a center of every scene and every scene has the same tone... What was great in this movei, how the song We Will Rock You was created.
Not great movie at all.. Great Rami Malek..",7,1,7,15 January 2019
Justice League," Another disaster
","Where to start... Stupid story, horrible cinematography, and yes, you cannot be surprised for those meme jokes about this toilet movie.. only one character in this movie is watchable and its flash, cuz he is only one , who is at least lil bit funny and not annoying.. every other character is cliche filled boredom and wonder woman and her entry scene is a joke as the whole movie.. batman deserves better and it was huge mistake to put batman back on screen so early after Nolans trilogy...",1,1,2,18 December 2017
Avengers: Endgame," DOWNGRADE after very good Infinity War
","Dont get me wrong, i know 99% of the reviews are from marvel/avengers fans but hey im not blame you all youre are blind and marketing from producers swept you down. Let me see - opening was perfect but suddenly half of the movie is boring, cheaply dark, second part of the movie is too chaotic. Movie trashes other truly legendary films about their non logical sory but here is seemingly everything logical ? LOL ... I could name like 6 very stupid/ilogical/boring things but hey, whats the point. Im just glad all the avengers nonsense ended. I liked Infinity War for its adult-ish story, dark/serious tone, nice and attractive story but here producers knew that EVERYTHING goes and NOTHING will be criticised from die hard fans.. Even if the movie was bad in 50% of the avengers fan, still everybody from you would love it.. Producers have the luck that this franchise is very very solid in terms of acceptance..
For neutral fan like me ? theres HUGE gap between Infinity War and Endgame.",3,10,18,3 May 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Chaotic, no better than previous part
","I am neutral, not die hard fan of the franchise. For me, SW starts with SW: F. Awakens... which was more solid and story was holding together. Here, the story is boring, too lenghtly stretched into many lines, where you must find yourself thanks to big jumps from line to line...For example Finn´s storyline is boring, Rose is ULTRA ANNOYING.. Humour is 90% childlish but i give you that some of em were very funny. Final battle is joke, so many cliché (phasma preparing to execute hostage like 10 minutes) , Rey was put aside and despite hard training she had ONE action scene against snoke and thats it ? Only good thing for die hard fans is character development - huge step forward for Poe and Kylo Ren.. Those two are main pillars of the story.. Overal - boring, more childlish, dissapointing, but i accept that high score, cuz the movie is playing with your emotions and 95% of our planet are people with weak emotions, so score is that high...",6,0,0,18 December 2017
Joker," Missed Opportunity, but Phoenix grabbed an Oscar
","First of all, lil bit spoilers ok ! dont read if you wanna know nothing.
Ok . first CONS of this movie:
1.)Thomas Wayne and Wayne corp is portrayed like an Evil ..
2.)Little Bruce Wayne is potrayed like a autistic child.
3.)If you look closely, the story is hundred times watched social analysis of individaul who is strugling against 'system'...
4.) Ending is waaay to 'ok im done and tired, lets write it quickly, let the fans make their own judgement about ending and what it is,..
5) the biggest flop in my eyes was the scene in ready room in the robert de niro show when Fleck asked about introducing like a joker... jesus christ its a JOKER movie so that sentence should be DARK, underlined with gritty and dark music theme .. JOKER... can you introduce me as ..... bu bum bummm JOKER ... get it ?
6) Stupid and so common relevances to todays Donald Trump era.. Joaquin is middle class (both democrats or republicans voter) and Wayne is Donald Trump-esque character.. And the gotham is post-election world with tension.. So obvious yet so boring . trump is your president, deal with it..PROs:
1) Joaquin Phoenix. I was sceptical but legendary acting here.
2) Music , sound , cinematography, colours and dialogues.
3) twists , halucinations vs reality
4) Fridge
5) Connection to the Waynes murder / bridge to batman
6) Overally not boring at all, i guess minimum of cliechÃ©s
7) dont do a sequel.. no need .. its perfect as origin for this character even tho nobody knows (not even writters) if HE was the REAL joker or just catalyst for creating one .",6,0,4,11 October 2019
12 Strong," Technically perfect, action scenes brilliant.
","It very good war movie. It brings back the memories of Rambo III and its kinda spin-off of Lone Survivor but its better, because at least, there is no american cliché, no stupid american melodrama. quite surprisingly many dialogues are 'real' and funny. Yes you can argue, if the 'based on true story' is accurate here, but if so, taliban soldiers are even worse than stormtroopers from Star Wars..
Movie is not boring at all, action is fantastic and even Hemsworth is watchable even though i´d like to see another type of actor there..
Summary - very good and entertaining movie for men, very watchable, nothing new on war movies but excellent camera and technical work.",8,5,8,3 June 2018
Kong: Skull Island," Don't know where is the fun
","Its the rip off from Godzilla (monster beating monsters, nuclear test as a cover up for killing try outs).. Acting crew is a joke. Hiddleton cliché-like leader, S.L. Jakson is the best player here but again nothing new - washed up veteran who is so readable and predictable, story is boring, scripted, wannabe funny start, cliché opening duo (nerd,underrated guy who is not listened nor trusted), nice girl who has her one wannabe tough scene (flare gun). only good thing is actually fight between kong and final monster. worst thing is actually Kong himself revealing - too early and not even bit curious or stylish (in Godzilla they introduced it very nicely). Visual is breathtaking no doubt, but the story has nothing to offer, you already know who survives, who is gonna pay and how. the tribe has nothing to offer, the MIA veteran (J.C. Reilly) has nothing to offer and he is rather annoying.its not action packed, its not funny, its not creative.. Its visually stimulating and that's all.",3,3,7,9 April 2017
Creed II," Dumbest Boxer fighter in boxing movies universe
","Really ? 7.6 ? For what ? Only person who acts like sane or normal person is balboa.. Creed could be stubborn and it would be ok with me. But he is just dumb, spoiled, arrogant prick, who gives a f** about rocky and disrespects him two times with really ugly way.. Too bad that writters or producers didnt shape him like REAL Apollos´s son. It would be miles ahead better and nicer to watch. This Cred is unwatchable and unhearable person who cant even propose his girl. Biana is annoying, arrogant as well in final match, screaming like black teen same as Mayweathers daughter (vs McGregor). She screams to the crowd after first round like horny cow, really..Drago junior before EVERY move, talk or action looks at his father , seeking permission.. in way like, he would seeking permission even to take a pee. Story itself is predicatble from first second. What bothers me most is the desert period. Rocky inclining that Adonnis has to change his style but we dont get to know anything closer about that change, i mean, remember rocky or rocky 3 ? changes in boxing style were explained and well executed. Here ? nothing.. Bad movie with best old Rocky you can get. I really enjoyed watching Sly bcuz it wasnt cliche like in Rocky Balboa film.. He acted normal and naturaly.",4,15,27,12 February 2019
Life," Horribly Beautiful or beautifully horrible ?
","Im huge fan of scifi so couldn't missed it.. nothing is perfect including this film, but come on, don't be like those guys who criticize every scene in logical,physical,scientific point of view..it has great freshness in it, very welcomed ending, great build up and working start of the second act. film has numerous scenes where you get goosebumps, especially girls will be shocked no doubt. Only thing is that Reynolds is predictably the 'funny guy' of this crew and it seems bit annoying. he maybe wanted this role and be similar like in dead-pool or so.. he is funny guy and i like this person in real life but he should try to play very reasonable, pragmatic, calm guys.. maybe he should play Gylenhaal's role.. Characters are only weak point. you must like em from another movies to wish them luck here. you don't know em much. you see who's got family, who's got spooky sense for living in space, but is it enough ? Yes movie has ALien (1979) DNA in it, yes its modern-like horror, but first of all it has power to scare you or spook you (at least), because the monster is pretty awesome, scary and it has all horror ingrediences in that monster design. I think its very very working film, and i would recommned to everyone, firstly to all who are not scifi fans because at least you would see what you are missing..",9,72,125,9 April 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," Larger, Deeper does not mean automatically better.
","Its like you have second date with a girl, you don't want to lose, so next you take her somewhere better, more expensive, but the girl wants to be comfy and not to feel, you want impress her with the money and place. Yes, chapter II is in the same waters like first part. But in this movie, there are some bit boring sequences like that with Fishburne and maybe more for some individuals. Actions sequences here are beautifully done, story is basic and finale is adequate. all of this is dona by the same formula. Only ONE BETTER thing for me is characters. Thanks to larger scale, there are new players and are pretty good to watch. Non-talking woman and Common - both are very very watchable and add new dimensions. They are more attractive than (still very good) Dafoe in first part. I am music man but i don't remember any catchy hook or loop in terms of soundtrack. Little bit sad from directing the end. SPOILER: When Wick is running away in very last shot, the angle of camera should have been closely to his face, not to take large scale. It would be much better and more dramatic if we could some expressions in his face, like for the first time - fear for example... END of SPOILER: Overall - funny to watch, classy, more expensive.",7,5,9,13 May 2017
