Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Honestly Entertaining Abe
","It's not often you find a blockbuster without any star-power in its ranks unless it's some sort of epic disaster movie which Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (ALVH) isn't. With a rather eccentric concept where the 16th President of the United States is an undercover hunter of vampires, Timur Berkmambetov manages to deliver an action packed feature with some stunning cinematography.While munching on their popcorn, audiences won't be inundated with simple action as writer Seth Grahame-Smith has blended in Lincoln's milestone moments in to the tapestry of the film.ALVH doesn't claim to be a profound movie but it does deliver as an action-packed, popcorn- munching entertainer and would be worth watching on the big screen let alone at home.",7,1,2,11 February 2013
World War Z," World War Z
","An ex United Nations Investigator is forced to help identify the origin of a virus that envelopes the world transforming the living in to Zombies. The fate of humanity hangs in the balance as he scours the planet trying to stay alive and keep his family safe. Director Marc Forster, the man behind Quantum of Solace, takes on the daunting task of transforming Max Brooks' novel on to the big screen and does so handsomely. Forster seamlessly ties in the grand locations and manic pace with the intensity of the film leaving the audience at the edge of their seat for the most part. In spite of having a good idea of the outcome, you still find yourself rooting for Pitt's character. Although the visuals is the real star of the film, Brad Pitt performs expectedly well while his wife, Mireille Enos from The Killing and Big Love fame, plays her role adequately. Although not an epic and a tad predictable, World War Z is definitely an entertaining blockbuster that ranks among one of the better Zombie films. This is undoubtedly one to watch and enjoy!",7,2,6,22 June 2013
The Impossible," Tearjerking; The Impossible
","On vacation at an exotic resort in Thailand, a family of 5 are torn apart by a large tsunami that rips the island apart. The mother, played by Naomi Watts and oldest of the three sons do their best to survive while the father, played by Ewan McGregor, juggles between the safety of his two boys and the search for his wife and missing son.Director Juan Antonio Bayona vividly shares the shocking and yet, miraculous story of the Alvarez family. The cinematography when the tsunami sweeps in is nothing short of stunning and captivating. A glimpse of the sheer force and destruction behind this natural disaster will undoubtedly leave you breathless. Watts delivers a strong performance as does McGregor but the stand out here, besides the cinematography, is the brilliant and mature portrayal of the oldest son by young, Tom Holland.An emotional tearjerker, The Impossible is a brilliant film, which will have you glued to the screen as you root against the odds while simultaneously fearing the worst. The fact that it's based on a true story is a testament of the human spirit and the bond of a family. The Impossible is definitely one to watch.",7,52,66,11 February 2013
Argo," A Go for Argo!
","Based on a true story that transpired during the 1979 revolution in Iran, Argo tells the tale of a CIA mission to extract 6 Americans under the rouse of a film crew. Donning the hat of the lead and director, Ben Affleck unravels the story brilliantly keeping the audience chucking and at the edge of their seat simultaneously. The large and recognisable cast from John Goodman and Alan Arkin to Bryan Cranston, play their roles perfectly well and keep you glued to the screen. Even though you may know how the story ends, you'll still find your palms sweating as you forget to breathe while rooting for the underdogs. The Argo team must also be commended for visually recreating the 70s/80s to give the audience a certain authenticity. When Ben Affleck burst on the scene with the Oscar winning screenplay of Good Will Hunting, he was billed as one of the next rising stars with an abundance or promise. However Hollywood is a fickle wench where you're only as good as your last movie and after a few bad choices such as Jersey Girl and the unpronounceable, Gigli, Affleck's star dimmed considerably. It was a credible performance in Hollywoodland along with his writing/directing prowess in The Town that firmly stamped his mark in the industry. With Argo, he simply cemented that stamp. This is definitely one to watch.",8,0,3,17 February 2013
Ted," Ted-errific
","Creator of popular shows such as Family Guy and American Dad, Seth MacFarlane leaps on to the big screen with the comedy, Ted. A young boy's wish brings a teddy bear to life and an unbreakable bond between the two is formed. However, as they grow up, life creeps in to their wholesome life as Ted becomes a washed out child star while his friend, played by Mark Wahlberg is in a job going no where. The college mentality between the two friends puts a strain on Wahlberg's relationship with the stunning Mila Kunis, forcing him to make a tough choice.Mark Wahlberg, known more for his action and intense roles has transitioned in to comedy rather successfully and doesn't disappoint in this feature. Kunis, tagged the sexiest woman alive by esquire, has a long history of working with MacFarlane and plays her role adequately. As Ted, MacFarlane will keep you laughing and all the 80s references are icing for those who remember that era.With a host of amusing cameos, MacFarlane hits another home run with this refreshing comedy that will undoubtedly spawn a sequel. This is definitely worth a watch, just make sure it's without your kids!",8,0,2,11 February 2013
Warrior," Worthy Warrior
","Warrior is a story about two estranged brothers forced by circumstance to enrol in to a MMA Cage Fighting tournament. This puts both on a collision course to potentially face each other in an ultimate battle. Joel Edgerton plays a schoolteacher while Tom Hardy, an ex-marine with a haunting past, plays the younger brother. What sounds like a man-flick full of blood and fists is anything but! There is a decent plot only elevated by incredible performances particularly by the diverse, Tom Hardy. Nick Nolte does his job well as the drunk father who mumbles through his lines and Edgerton, is only overshadowed by Hardy.With the popularity of UFC, it's no surprise that director and writer, Gavin O'Connor took a stab with bringing a movie like Warrior to the masses and although you may compare it to Rocky, it stands on it's own feet and does it well. The action sequences in the fights are shot remarkably well and forces the viewers to feel! Warrior is a great cinematic feature with something for everyone and comes highly recommended for all moviegoers.",8,2,5,11 February 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A Tattoo to admire.
","Based on a best seller, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is another piece or art that makes its treacherous journey from the paper it was born on, to the silver screen. Donning the mantle of trying to do it justice are Daniel Craig, of Bond fame, and Rooney Mara who starred in The Social Network and Nightmare on Elm Street. Her striking transformation leaves an indelible mark in the viewers mind and is only surpassed by her performance of a badass, tech genius with social deficiencies. Craig on the other hand is anything but Bond like and successfully does his bit not to be pigeonholed as an Action-Man. Instead, he parades his acting chops and demands to be recognised for his ability.David Fincher, the director who brought us memorable films such as Se7en, Fight Club and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is clearly capable at the helm of Stieg Larsson's masterpiece. Fincher gently steers the audience down two parallel winding paths where the travellers are spiralling in their own lives only to meet at a crucial junction. Before you know it, you're hooked and are unable to turn away. Under the surface of the mystery, David gives you haunting glimpses in to the disturbing and nauseating primal nature of man, which is brutal in its reality.In a genre riddled with predictability and well-travelled twists and turns, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a refreshing breath of fresh air. Both Craig and especially, Mara only enhance Fincher's vision further with notable performances.",Null,2,5,11 February 2013
Batman Begins," The Dark Knight Returns!
","Christopher Nolan undertook the difficult task of bringing back Gotham's savior and managed to pull it off in style. Nolan's tribute to the 'Caped Crusader' is a clean break from the twentieth century franchise that included Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney donning the mask of the great DC comic detective. The chiseled Christian Bale takes on the mantle of the 'Dark Knight' as Nolan delivers a gritty, edgy and, dare I say it, more realistic Batman than his predecessors, who inadvertently ended up making a parody of the superhero and his exploits. Bale delivers a troubled and dark Bruce Wayne who in is complexity is more credible then the Bruces of the past. As Batman, he fits the mold although his delivery could use some work.Cillian Murphy is far too pretty to play an arch villain like 'The Scare Crow' who, surprisingly, didn't pose much of a threat and would be laughed at if considered a true nemesis. On the other side of the tracks is the world's favourite girl next door, Ms. Holmes, who still looks like she belongs at the creek. Though their efforts are both apparent and commendable, they still come across as children caught up in a game for grownups.Michael Caine brings emotion, humor and charm to the character of Alfred the Butler as is Gary Oldman believable as the helpless but good, Sergeant Gordon. The original Hitchhiker is back too, with Rutger Hauer's convincing portrayal of the ever so sinister Earle who runs Wayne Enterprises until Bruce comes of age.Liam Neeson's performance is the big surprise in this movie of all stars, which also includes Oscar winner Morgan Freeman and Oscar nominee Ken Watanabe from 'The Last Samurai.' The audience can always expect a great performance from Neeson but in this flick he really hits the mark especially with the physical demands of his character. Not to be out done by the other heavy weights, Tom Wilkinson, also an Oscar nominee for 'In the Bedroom, is up to par in his performance as the immoral underworld boss, Carmine Falcone.The action scenes are shadowed by darkness, literally. The audience doesn't get the opportunity to fully appreciate the fights mainly because they take place under limited lighting. On a brighter note, it's enjoyable to see how Bruce Wayne actually transforms into 'The Batman' albeit is at an accelerated pace. With the combination of a worthy Batman, a great cast, a plot that's not totally predictable and a more REAL and gritty feel, 'Batman Begins' is an enjoyable feature that leaves you waiting anxiously for the next installment.",8,6,9,18 June 2005
Django Unchained," Django Unstoppable
","Although I respect his talent and originality, I've never really been a hardcore fan of Quentin Tarantino's work. As a result, I wasn't racing to the cinema once Django Unchained was released, in spite of the stellar cast and captivating trailer. When the film started, I was expecting the typical tale of vengeance portrayed in uber violent Tarantino fashion and isn't that part of the reason so many are drawn to his work? (So why chastise the man for it?)Django Unchained is a story where a chance meeting leads to the emancipation of a slave, played by Jamie Foxx, only to see Django transform in to a skilled bounty hunter. An agreement between the mentor, Christoph Waltz, and protégé is struck which culminates in the partners rescuing Django's slave wife.The twist about Django is, I quite enjoyed it and would argue that it's perhaps Tarantino's finest work to date! Firstly, the unexpected cameos like Don Johnson and Jonah Hill were a pleasant surprise as was the simplistic yet very amusing dialogue. When you're not chuckling at the banter, you'll be drawn in by the captivatingly raw emotion that Tarantino encapsulates perfectly. Yes, there is exceptional violence but it's about appreciating the vision rather than judging it.One can't attribute the success of Django solely to Tarantino's talent, as it wouldn't be as entertaining without equally riveting performances from the lead characters as well as Leonardo DiCaprio. However, there is one character that stands out above the rest and that is Samuel L. Jackson's portrayal of Stephen. If you're a fan of The Boondocks, where Jackson also guest stars, Stephen is as close as you'll get to a cross between Uncle Ruckus and Stinkmeaner and the end result is absolutely hilarity!In an industry where films are continually becoming predictable, Tarantino shares an entertaining tale with twists, turns, humour, action, drama and that fading facet, originality. With intense direction and clever writing which is complimented by outstanding performances, Django Unchaiend is one unmissable feature.Django Unchained is definitely one to watch on the big screen!",9,1,3,11 February 2013
The Bourne Legacy," The Bourne Side-Kick
","Jeremy Renner has shot to stardom by inking himself to an array of successful franchises from, Mission Impossible to the Avengers. The Bourne series is yet another feather in his fluttering hat. Renner plays an operative who is supposed to be terminated along with the others as a result of the whole Jason Bourne fiasco. Renner however doesn't abide and with the help of Rachel Weisz, a doctor, he sets off on a personal mission to obtain the drugs to prevent a critical withdrawal. With a heavyweight cast, which includes Ed Norton, Scott Glenn and Stacy Keach, The Bourne Legacy is equipped with all the tools it needs to add to the high octane Bourne Legacy, no pun intended. The story unwinds parallel to the Jason Bourne saga, which is clever and enjoyable for hardcore Bourne fans. There are the expected jaw dropping stunts, fights and chases to satisfy the action junkie in all of us. The story is also more of a stand-alone rather than an open-ended one meaning it's nicely tied up in a ribbon for viewers without the expectation for a sequel. Renner plays his role well but somewhat pales in comparison to Matt Damon and while director, Tony Gilroy certainly does justice to the franchise, The Bourne Legacy is more of a deserving sidekick to the original trilogy. Action and Bourne fans alike should enjoy Legacy provided they don't go in expecting Jason Bourne.",7,0,1,17 February 2013
Blood Diamond," The Cost of Blood Diamond
","Edward Zwick perfectly captures the horror of a beautiful nation ravaged by greed and civil war. The contrast of the serene African landscape raped by the soulless war where death is a commonality, is depicted both graphically and accurately. The vision of hell on earth, especially the terror of children firing guns and killing without remorse haunts the viewer long after the curtain goes down.Jennifer Connelly, Arnold Vosloo and David Harewood submit notable performances however they are mightily eclipsed the by the powerful performances of Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou. Since his role in 'Amistad', Hounsou has been considered as an actor in a class of his own, while DiCaprio has turned in his best and most mature performance to date and deserves all the praise and accolades he receives.Blood Diamond opens the eyes of all those who go about their daily lives unaware and unaffected by the transgressions that take place against humanity and forces realisation as to the true cost of a life of luxury.Zwick, with the aid of an incredible backdrop, impressive cinematography and two commanding performances, has created a powerful masterpiece that tugs at the soul.",8,0,0,31 January 2007
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Laughing With The Smiths
","Angelina Jolie is breathtaking while the ladies will certainly swoon over the ever-cool Brad Pitt. Even though the public probably views Jen as a better match for Mr. Smith, the arresting Jolie does a commendable job of playing his better half in the movie.The action scenes are engaging but it's the playful and almost childlike exchange between the couple that keeps the audience entertained. While not known for his comedic talents, Pitt delivers the laughs in his own unique manner and the amusing Vince Vaughn only adds to the entertainment.Although burdened with a predictable plot and an anticlimactic ending reminiscent of a 'Gun Kata' fight sequence from Kurt Wimmer's Equilibrium, one still enjoys the film for what it is, a fun movie.",7,0,5,10 June 2005
Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock Rocks the Screens!
","Sherlock Holmes is a visually spectacular feature which is complemented by a superb cast. Downey Jr. continues to illustrate his exquisite acting chops while Jude law provides a notable performance. Strong is the dark horse that captures and portrays his character unexpectedly well and almost steals the limelight. Guy Ritchie, after a slew of cinematic atrocities has finally managed to conjure up a successful formula once again and will undoubtedly keep the franchise of Holmes successfully safe in the majestically talented hands of Downey Jr. In conclusion, Sherlock Holmes is an eclectic concoction that pleasurably unravels to the audiences delight in a very unlike Guy Ritchie format. Kudos!",8,0,5,10 January 2010
Casino Royale," Gambling With The Blonde Bond
","Martin Campbell returns to the realm of James Bond 11 years after his first dip in the Fleming franchise with Golden Eye and the previous MI6 super agent, Pierce Brosnan. Coincidently Golden Eye was Brosnan's first stab at portraying Bond and fittingly, Campbell returns to usher in the newest 007 in Daniel Craig. Craig's selection to play the role was controversial to say the least however from the start he makes the part his own. Choosing not to follow the lead of previous agents, Craig portrays Bond as more gritty and edgy. Even though Craig's Bond lacks the charm and charisma of his predecessors, he does brings his own brand of rugged cool. Probably not the sharpest of Bond's in the saga but Craig is certainly the one with most brawn and isn't afraid to use it which the audience discovers almost immediately in the exhilarating chase sequence involving Bond alongside the jaw dropping athleticism of Sebastien Foucan who plays Mollaka.Campbell keeps the successful Bond formula alive with great stunts, chase scenes and raw power however the villain depicted by Mads Mikkelsen doesn't impress and seems hardly formidable while fan favourite 'Q' and his gadgets are sorely missed. Nonetheless, Casino Royale is an entertaining ride and was worth the wait. Craig does lack in certain aspects when being compared to those that once donned the mantel of James Bond, and although he isn't the most verbose of Bond's, Craig more than makes up for it with his original portrayal and in turn, assuring fans that the future of Fleming's brainchild is in safe hands.",7,0,1,28 November 2006
Flight," Fly-by Flight
","An alcoholic and drug-abusing pilot on a routine flight, pulls of a miraculous stunt and saves his passengers. Dubbed a Hero, Captain Whitaker struggles to contain his addictive behaviour during the course of the investigation. The powers that be try to contain his volatile habit as they work to put the matter to rest but have an uphill battle as the self-serving Whitaker battles his own demons. Denzel Washington portrays a broken pilot masterfully and is rewarded with a deserving Oscar nod. Meanwhile the supporting cast including Don Cheadle, John Goodman and Bruce Greenwood play their roles well. Denzel's love interest, an equally damaged Kelly Reilly, does her job but her character isn't really developed enough.A character driven piece, Flight's pace slows down rapidly after an adrenaline driven and breathtaking start. At times, it get's a little too slow and the mind of the audience may begin to wander. Denzel and the supporting cast are stellar but Robert Zemeckis' movie on a whole lacks teeth somewhat. It's an intense drama which is worth a watch, but outside of Washington, there really isn't anything Oscar worthy about Flight.",6,1,3,17 February 2013
Looper," Super Looper
","One has to applaud Joseph Gordon-Levitt's success in shedding off his goofy character from the 90s hit show, 3rd Rock from the Sun and transforming himself in to a viable A-lister! By placing himself amidst established stars in high profile films such as Inception and The Dark Knight Rises, Levitt forced audiences to take note. Simultaneously he picked movies like 50/50 and 500 days of summer which highlighted his range and ability. In Looper, Levitt continues with the same formula as he stands with icon, Bruce Willis while playing a bounty hunter of sorts in this time travelling Sci-Fi Thriller. Willis leaves his mark with his performance while Levitt continues to deliver and shape a blossoming career. Emily Blunt rounds out the cast and compliments her co-stars well.Director and writer Rian Johnson brings an entertaining feature which cleverly unravels keeping the audience glued all the way till the credits roll. Looper is definitely worth a watch.",8,0,1,11 February 2013
Fantastic Four," 'Fantastic Four' the whole family;
","The trend of Marvel heroes being transferred from the comic books to the big screen continues with Tim Story's adaptation of the 'Fantastic Four'. By having an ensemble of popular TV actors rather then any big names, Story allows the audience to concentrate on the movie and the incredible special effects. The sexy Jessica Alba from Dark Angel and Sin City fame takes on the role of the Invisible girl and although the male audience will be disappointed to learn they'll hardly see Ms. Alba, rest assured when you do see her, the wait is worth it. To see Michael Chiklis from 'The Shield' as straight up 'good guy' is both strange and refreshing. Casting Chiklis as the 'The Thing' could have been considered as a risk but both the producers and Chiklis must be smiling to learn their gamble paid off and then some. Julian McMahon who plays the slick Dr. Troy in Nip/Tuck excels as the villainous electric Von Doom while on the other side of the intensity spectrum, Chris Evans dons the 'flame' of 'The Torch' and has the audience chucking with his witty, Ryan Reynolds-esquire performance. The enjoyable and atypical plot enables the audience to gradually learn about the characters, their powers and the emotions they endure as they come to terms with their fate. Even though the final confrontation between good and evil leaves a lot to be desired, one can't help feeling that this is a solid foundation to build a successful franchise on. With humour, incredible stunts and effects, 'Fantastic Four' has something enjoyable for the whole family.",7,1,3,23 July 2005
The Cabin in the Woods," An entertaining Cabin in some original Woods
","When I finally decided to watch Drew Goddard's 'The Cabin in the Woods' I expected the clichéd tale of a group of youngsters vacationing in the woods only to be hunted by some psychopath or demonic creature. The truth is I was half right and half wrong, and boy was that wrong, really wrong!Chris Hemsworth is the big draw here and although his role was nothing Thor like, he does plays the big jock adequately. The other characters serve their purpose well while conspiracy theorist and stoner, Fran Kranz, is the stand out performer here. Veteran Bradley Whitford has to get a mention too, as you can't help but like his sadistically kooky character.As the end credits role, you may find yourself impressed with how the creators took an old, run down plot and flipped the script before remixing it Diddy style! Then, you'll begin to wonder if there's a sequel in the works as all you want is more!All in all, writers Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard have done a fantastic job in seamlessly weaving horror and comedy together and creating a refreshing popcorn flick that will make you chuckle before shrieking in horror! Definitely worth a watch!",7,0,2,11 February 2013
Cinderella Man," The one to watch
","Ron Howard's masterpiece lives up to the hype of being the 'Best movie so far, by far' this year. The touching story makes you ache for those that suffered through the great depression while the final fight leaves you tensed at the edge of your seat.Russell Crowe puts forth another Oscar worthy performance while Renee Zellweger exhibits why she is currently one of the hottest stars in Hollywood. However, the unexpected surprise is Paul Giamatti's portrayal of Jim Braddock's trainer, Joe Gould, which is more than on par with the two Tinseltown heavyweights and may even getting him an Oscar nod.There are few movies that provoke an audience to holler and applause and Cinderella Man does that and more and when the viewers did, for once it didn't irritate me.A must see.",8,0,0,5 June 2005
The Island," Bay Delivers with 'The Island'
","Michael Bay leaves other directors in his wake as he retains the coveted title of the best action/adventure director today. In the Island, Bay merges the styles of John Woo and Michael Mann to his own unique blend of direction and the cocktail is a success as he continues to strengthen his legacy.As odd as it is watching Ewan McGregor spew out an American accent, one can't help but admit they were wrong in assuming he had been miscast in this action caper. In fact, McGregor demonstrates his ever expanding range and leaves audiences more then satisfied with his performance as an action hero.The voluptuous Scarlett Johansson is not only a joy to gaze at but this pouty bombshell is a versatile talent to boot as her beauty is matched only by her ability. There is a natural and smooth chemistry between the two stars which is best illustrated in their first kiss which should snap up the MTV Movie Award for best kiss.Dijimon Hounsou and Sean Bean rounds out an eclectic more then capable cast which also has Steve Buscemi and a brief appearance by Michael Clark Duncan in tow. Bean convincingly portrays the role of the sinister Dr. Merrick who suffers from the ultimate God complex while Honsou is perfectly cast as the hunter who is responsible for chasing down the 'products'. Buscemi had the audience chuckling with his performance while the gigantic Duncan who was nominated for best supporting actor The Green Mile, is hardly used at all.The combination of an eclectic cast and vicious heart pumping action which leaves you gasping in awe as you jump back in your seat makes the Island a thoroughly enjoyable experience. This is what summer flicks are all about!",7,1,2,16 August 2005
