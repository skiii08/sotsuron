Minority Report," A little bit for everyone.
","Mainly an action flick it also gives you a taste of drama, and just about everything else. Good special effects and weird plot twists it keeps you on the edge of your seat. I'm not a big fan of Cruise but he shines in this one. Its one of the best of the millennium. This one hits on all cylinders.",10,0,0,28 October 2002
Braveheart," A Moving, Modern masterpiece.
","Definatly one of the best films of the 90's and of all time. Gibson gives another extraordinary performance as usual, and a good supporting cast fills in the rest as this movie gets a 10 from an avid movie goer.",10,1,4,28 October 2002
