Walk the Line," best film i'v seen for a long time
","I have seen this film and think that it is one of the best film's i have seen for some time. I found it to be very well made and well worth the trip to see this film if you don't see any more film's this year you should see this one. it starts with johnny cash as a young boy growing up with his older brother back on the family farm. it seem's that growing up was not a good time for him. the film then jumps forward to his time in the armed forces then on to stating his band when he comes home from his stint in the air force. then you see his carer take off and see his life go down the drain due to drugs, and how his life is turned round by the woman he loves.",10,1,2,21 February 2006
