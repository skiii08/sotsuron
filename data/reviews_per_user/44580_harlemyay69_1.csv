Stop-Loss," if true very sad
","Honestley I believe this story wholeheartedly, and I know people like this in my city. I'm from Evansville Indiana and I know rednecks just like this from there so those of you that say that the acting was bad back off from that unless your from Texas or somewhere where you know people like this. But regardless of that I'm not a big political person and the sad fact of that is a lot of soldiers aren't either. When most soldiers sign up for duty I think that they think that they are fighting for there country and don't really realize what it is they are out there for. When Ryan Phillipe's character said that he signed up to get back for 9/11 and found out that wasn't what it was about it really hit home for me. Soldier's for the most part don't know what exactly , they are there risking they're lives, possibly killing innocent families, risking they're crews and friends life, despite being ignorant of what, exactly they are fighting for. The acting in this film is excellent, many think it's not because the characters get on your nerves. to be honest with you, all the characters got on my nerves. But I can say first hand that this movie is one of the most realistic and legitimate films of are current political situations. Many will say it gives an ignorant point of view, but that's the point of view it's supposed to give from the soldiers. The only part in the film that I don't know firsthand is the major part of Stop-Loss The fact that ryan Phillipe's character was an excellent soldier and sergeant and was supposed to go home but was sent back to Iraq. This is why if you know soldiers it is very sad to me. If he didn't go back he automatically became a fugitive... this is absurd to me. But it's probably real. It's like he robbed a convenience store or something. I'm just saying, if somebody was a cop and just wanted to quit after he was trying to save people on 9/11, are you seriously going to incarcerate him? This movie made me think of things like that. This movie will not entertain everybody even though it's far from boring. It's far from clich√© because even though I thought that I saw the twists coming and the predictable romantic undertow coming I have to say that this is for soldiers and families of soldiers.",7,0,0,13 September 2008
