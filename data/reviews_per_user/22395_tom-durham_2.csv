Conquest 1453," drawn out and historically inaccurate. Nice CGI
","The pacing on this movie is terrible. There is maybe 1.5 hours of actual content plus 1 hour of fluff. In addition there is a lack of interest in history when making this movie. You'd think for 2.5 hours there is plenty of opportunity to cover the many interesting historical points of the battle for example. In reality they picked maybe 5 main points and these get a minute of screen time each. It's quite bad.Watching this movie gives you more of an insight into the Turkish culture and religion than the actual conquest of Constantinople. For example they can't show Mohamed on screen so they cleverly use the camera itself, so you the audience become Mohamed. Except it then becomes confusing as you don't realise when this transition occurs back. Also there are many prayers involved. There is even a 'suicide bomb' scene where they all yell Allah Akbar before blowing themselves up.This movie is almost least twice as long as it should be, given it's content. The script really lets it down, there is little dialogue in parts, and much attention is given to drawn out camera movements or people being idle. The first half of the movie, the lead up to the battle is not too bad. However the second half, the actual battle, is ruined by the drawn out scenes. If the director's effort was to make us feel frustrated with the time required to conquer the city, he succeeded, for the wrong reasons. To add insult to injury, the English subs clearly skip a fair amount of dialogue.If you want to watch history reviewed with rose tinted glasses by the victor, plus an hour of fluff this is it.",1,1,4,25 March 2017
The Great Dictator," Very overrated
","What is very clear is that Charlie Chaplain is the master of silent films and slapstick humour. Unfortunately, this is not a silent film.Near the beginning there is a ~5-10 minute long 'joke' of a speech in garbled German-English words. I couldn't even make out what he is saying, the German-English jokes were not at all obvious, and so it was not funny and quite boring. If you manage to keep watching past this, you're doing well, it gets better but not by much.The small amount of classic charlie chaplain slapstick was mostly good and I laughed a few times at that, but unfortunately between the slapstick is tedious, unexciting dialogue.Maybe what Charlie Chaplain did was ground breaking at the time. Today, it fails to capture interest long enough to enjoy the comedic elements.",2,6,19,17 December 2016
