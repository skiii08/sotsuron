10 Cloverfield Lane," I have an idea how to make this movie so much better
","Again, people, SPOILER WARNING. This is literally my first review on IMDb ever, I have read many, but this movie made me want to finally give my own opinion for a change. Okay, so about my idea. Cut the last ten minutes of the movie or so. Michelle goes out. She sees there's no poisonous air. She sighs with relief. She sees an alien spacecraft. She says 'OH COME ON'. ROLL CREDITS. Absolutely every second after this point was completely unnecessary in my opinion. They could even make a sequel which is actually about fighting aliens and stuff, sure, whatever. But hiding from an alien in a barn, while it just doesn't see her. Putting her makeshift hazmat suit in a matter of seconds, avoiding the poisonous gas that killed thousands or so ? KILLING A HUGE ALIEN WITH A BOTTLE OF ALCOHOL ?! Deciding to play the hero and go help other people ? What was that about, she's just a normal person who was caught in a bunker with a maniac and some other dude who just gets killed off anyway. Goodman was amazing, main actress was also pretty good, but I just started disliking her whole character at the end, since it made no sense whatsoever.",7,4,6,12 June 2016
