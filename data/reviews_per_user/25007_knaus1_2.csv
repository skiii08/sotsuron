Come and See," Come and See Review by Joshua knaus
","I enjoyed this film. You really get to understand the struggle and pain of the Russian people against the Nazi Germans. It didn't have this patriotic energy in this film for the viewer which I liked because you get to see the difficulties of war instead of just the victories of one, like in Saving Private Ryan. If I had to see which group was the Ant/Pro in the film. I would say the Russian army and people were the Antagonist and the Nazi's were as the Protagonist, because the Germans were in control of those towns, but that's how I saw it.What also made it nice was not really talking about the politics of why the Nazi's invaded Russia. But instead the methods and ways they took control of each town. This was showing the frustration and anger of how the Nazi's invasion was getting more and more popular for the average man 'the Russian farmers in the story' to rise up and fight. Even if they didn't even know anything that was happening with their government to fix the problem, anything about what was happening in Moscow, or even anything that was happening in the town next to them, which I enjoyed.",8,1,1,30 July 2010
The Battle of Algiers," La battaglia di Algeri review by Joshua K.
","I enjoyed this film. You really get to understand the motivation of the Algerian liberals against the French colonist. It had the patriotic energy in this film for the viewer perfectly. Making the Algerian liberals the Antagonist and the French colonist as the Protagonist.What made it nice was not really talking about the politics of the Algerian war. Like which parties supported the liberals or which supported the French colonist, the counter arguments from both sides, etc. This was explaining the movement and how it was getting more and more popular for the average Algerian, which I enjoyed.Another thing in the film the I liked was Jafar. One of the leaders for the liberals, he was the character that was on a stand off with the French military and eventually surrendering because they were going to bomb the house where he was in. Was actually involved in the liberation on Algeria and was actually playing himself in the film.I give this film hands down, two thumbs up.",8,0,0,27 May 2010
