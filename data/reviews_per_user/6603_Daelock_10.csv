Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Less Action, More Plot Makes This Series a True Epic
","My summary says it all, the sequel to Kill Bill Vol 1 packs in more plot for the sake of the huge battles of the first one. Not to say there aren't great fight scenes in this one, but none are quite as enormous as the Crazy 88 fight. However that was what was holding back Kill Bill from being a real 'epic' and just kept it in the realm of being a 'really awesome action flick,' a lack of any plot or backstory or even real character development(except for O-Ren), however this picks it up and goes into tons of backstory and develops all the main characters to some extent. I feel that, while many may be disappointed at the lessening of action, many more will enjoy the fact that this is what makes Kill Bill a true epic, plot where it was needed.",9,0,1,19 April 2004
The Ring," I've Never Been More Scared
","Now the fact is, I'm reasonably easy to scare. I come out of scary movies and usually don't sleep well that night. So some would say that would make me a poor judge of the fear factor(not a reference to the mindless show of the same name)of The Ring. However, quite the opposite is true. If I've been scared before, then the odds of something on the same level scaring me are unlikely. Now, I can most easily compare this movie to Red Dragon, while the two are almost nothing alike, they are both meant to elicit a response of fear. Red Dragon frightens on a far more visceral, primal level than does The Ring, which goes for a more psychological fear, but yet also on a very primal level. The images presented in the cassette that kills are very frightening, but we're not sure why. Certainly the strange background noise helps, but it is, in essence, a collection of random images. So why are they so disturbing? Because they have certain meanings that are ingrained in our psyche, all of which have negative connotations. A mirror reflecting something that isn't there, a little girl in darkness, a ladder(walking under one), a woman jumping from a cliff, a millipede and more are all images that are disturbing by their very nature. On with the review! The cinematography was amazing, with camera angles that captured everything that needed to be seen and also clued the more observant in the audience(of which I am certainly not one of!) into what was going on before the movie even said it. The sound was the other best 'tool.' It was amazing, every single noise meant to elecit a response and every single noise doing so. It contains one of the most terrifying scenes I have ever witnessed, but revealing what would ruin it, but trust me, you'll know when you see it. All in all, a movie that doesn't even strike until you're lying in bed trying to fall asleep and all the images flash in your mind. Very, very well done and scary.",Null,0,0,20 October 2002
Dawn of the Dead," Epitomizes What Modern Horror Should Be
","I'll keep it short since I haven't seen the original and most people seem to have made up their minds about whether or not to see it. This is a vicious movie. It's not necessarily the most violent ever, but it's certainly vicious. It has an intensity lacking from many modern horror films, especially from the zombie ones. The idea of swift zombies rather than the lurching ones is not new, 28 Days Later had it and as a result many comparisons have been drawn between the two movies, but I don't think it's fair. 28 Days Later was more about the human condition(I personally forgot about the zombie menace in the second half in light of the human nature aspect) while this one focuses on the zombies and their effect on people. This generates some truly genuinely moving scenes, mostly revolving around Mekhi Pfeifer's(I have no clue if that was spelled right) character and the character of a gun salesman trapped on his shop's roof. This movie is truly powerful in some parts. I thoroughly enjoyed it overall.",8,0,0,21 March 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," Open Your Eyes
","The Matrix Revolutions is a masterpiece. Based on critical reviews and reviews I've just heard people saying around here, I've just sent a great many of you into a spiral of anger, but for those who are undecided about this movie: see it. For those who think it's an abomination that ruins the series, open your eyes. In the words of Bane when he's possessed 'Look past the skin, past these gelatinous cattle-eyes and see your true enemy.' Now while this movie is not your enemy, you must look past the skin and dig deeper. Many people say that Reloaded was too much talk, not enough action(I seriously wonder if they fell asleep during the 'Burly Brawl' as it's been dubbed, and the freeway chase but that's another story) but The Matrix was never simply an action movie, even the supposedly infallible first film had it's fair share of talk, in fact it did that more than any of the others. Reloaded did what a sequel should: it grabbed you with action, but didn't necessarily develop the plot or characters as much as it could have. Revolutions wraps it all up, tying up most of the loose ends while presenting one or two just for the viewers to chew on. Obviously some will have a problem with an ending that doesn't answer every single question they have, but I found it to be a perfect conclusion to a near-perfect series. I also like how it focused its attentions to the more minor characters rather than the Holy Trinity(pardon the pun) of Trinity, Neo and Morpheus. I could go on and on, but in the end you've probably already made up your mind whether or not you're going to see the movie and maybe even if you're going to love or hate it. Go in with an open mind and a pair of open eyes and I guarantee you'll walk away satisfied with some wonderful conversations to have with others who have seen it.",9,0,0,6 November 2003
American History X," Intense, Very Very Intense
","This movie is awesome for so many different reasons. Edward Norton(I know it's been said) is the GREATEST American actor to come along in a long, long time(I'll admit I'm not very familiar with foreign films, so I won't say greatest actor worldwide, but he's GOT to be one of the best.) He can play any role, from a Catholic priest, to a con man, to a Neo-Nazi, but I think this movie is clearly his most powerful performance. He plays a Neo-Nazi who just got out of jail and has seemingly changed, though we're not really sure what he was like before, though the tattoos in the flashback that opens the movie give us a pretty good idea. The rest of the movie is partial flashback, partial current as he confronts a world he renounced in prison for reasons unknown(until close to the end, but I won't spoil it because the reason has layers upon layers.) and now his former running buddies are wondering what happened to their leader. Furlong's performance was 2D to be sure, but that almost seemed to be what his character was crying out to be. This easily molded follower archetype, and overall he did very well. The supporting characters were all excellent, but of course the blue ribbon goes to Norton for playing two radical extremes in the same movie. This movie does something that most movies about a racial subject matter don't do: it DOES NOT preach. It shows a very gradual, very REAL transformation, not like some ray of light shines on him and suddenly he sees the error of his ways. It takes experience, hardships and incredible agony to even plant the seed of reform in his mind. This movie is very, very powerful and very, very real.",Null,0,1,1 January 2003
The Butterfly Effect," FUBAR, but in a good way
","This movie was quite disturbing, from the first jump(the first of MANY) it'll either ensnare you or lose you. I do have one piece of advice to anyone reading this review before you see the film: Give Ashton a chance. So many people were on the forums here judging his performance based on the previews, and these were people who'd already made up their minds to hate the movie because of him, but it was unfair because he is more than competent as Evan in what was a very challenging role(calling for him to be humorous, serious and deeply disturbed all at once.) This is NOT a movie for children either, excessive swearing, some sex, drug use and heinous violence(I like my violence in movies, but the fact that many times children are committing it makes it very wrong). The movie delivers on jumps and a very good plot, though I am reminded of the Simpson's Halloween special where Homer time travels(which I know was based on something else). All in all, the movie is certainly above average in terms of overall quality, but it is DEFINATELY bizarre and very graphic and disturbing. Tremendous acting all around, nice to see Ethan Suplee back on the big(big BIG in his case) screen and nice to see that hopefully Ashton Kutcher won't succumb to Jim Carrey syndrome and be typecast until he has to make a series of movies just to prove he's more than 'the goofy actor'",6,1,1,25 January 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Left me breathless and speechless
","Warning: May contain VERY minor spoilersThis movie literally left me unable to catch my breath and unable to talk about to anyone who hadn't seen it. I saw it with a large group of friends and we were talking about it for a long time afterwards, but when I got home and my parents asked about it, all I could do was make a series of grunts to indicate I couldn't describe it yet. It needed to all sink in. After more previews than I've ever seen in one movie, it began. There was no recap, I was glad I'd recently re-watched LOTR: Fellowship SE on DVD, but the lack of a recap doesn't hurt the movie and serves to quicken the pace because that is truly what this movie is about: a faster pace. From the first scene of Gandalf and the Balrog to the final scene of...well that would be a spoiler, wouldn't it? This movie grabs you and doesn't let go EVER. At no point was I sighing and saying 'Come on! Come on! MOVE!!' The only time I checked my watch was in distress because there wasn't much of the movie left. This whole cast amazed me in the first movie. Everyone seemed like they were born to play the roles, although if you check the trivia section of the site, you'll see that Viggo Mortensen was not the first, or even second choice of Aragorn. The second movie doesn't add many major characters, save Gollum and Theodred, but everyone is perfect, especially Gollum. Andy Serkis captures the voice and movements of Gollum PERFECTLY and to a tee. The special effects crew who created the CG 'skin' for Serkis did an equally amazing job, making a CGI that was not only believable but able to express immense emotion and blend in almost seamlessly with the world around him. The battle of Helm's Deep was the most intense combat experience I've ever had at the movies. The battle rages for about 45 minutes and never drags. It amazingly incorporates computer effects and blends them with live actors, much like the first did with the battle at Mount Doom. The Ents are another amazing piece of CG work. Now, these are not so much complaints as they are observations. For book purists, this movie may disappoint. It's not faithful to the book in MANY places, but it never truly hurts the movie. They added something here, took away something there, changed this around and in the end, it is rather different but that does not mean inferior. Quite the contrary, I was happy to see the Wargs return for a scene and thought it was tastefully put in. In the end, this movie is truly a successor to Fellowship in every way. It is an amazing achievement and is sure to become a classic movie in years to come.",10,0,0,23 December 2002
X2: X-Men United," Simply Amazing
","**This review may contain MINOR SPOILERS. You have been forewarned!** This movie surpassed its prequel in every conceivable way. It had double the budget, which it showcased brilliantly through way more powers being used. From the flashy introduction that tosses us straight into the action up to the thrilling climax that leaves us breathless, this movie grabs on and does not let go until the credits start to roll. It's two hours and twenty minutes of near-perfection. The only complaint that I would make would be that character development for Cyclops was a little weak as it was for Professor X. Now I have some experience with the series, so I can fill in some of the holes myself, but not everyone has this luxury. But it's still a fairly minor complaint amid a sea of praise for this movie. Each and every actor, as far as I'm concerned, ARE the characters that they represent. Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Halle Barry, Alan Cumming, EVERYONE in the cast too lengthy to mention not only acts like their comic book counterpart, but physically resembles them. I think if this series continues for a long time, then this cast will surly be the 'Sean Connery' of the X-men movies, all others will simply be trying to imitate them, but there will be only one true cast. The action scenes were, despite everything else, what held this movie up. With the huge budget, the mutants could display their powers far more graphically and more vividly and they certainly do. Everything from Wolverine's vicious defense of the School to Nightcrawler's teleporting to Storm's weather control, everything is now vibrantly showed with incredible special effects. And Magento's jailbreak, while scientifically implausible, is impressive nonetheless. Anyway, isn't that why it's called science-FICTION? All in all, this movie is a more than worthy successor to the first and in fact follows such incredible sequels as Terminator 2 as it, in my opinion, far surpasses it's predecessor. 9/10",9,0,0,8 May 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Literally Took My Breath Away
","What can I say that hasn't been said? This movie is a gorgeous piece of what films can become. Everything falls into place flawlessly, the cast delivers performances for the ages(I personally think Viggo Mortensen should at least be nominated for an Oscar for his role as Aragorn)once again showing that the casting job could not be better filled by anyone. It's all been said, anything I put here would be redundant and you've probably already made up your mind as to if you're going to see the movie or not(or in some cases how many times you're going to see it), but to those who aren't, perhaps, just perhaps, you should. This movie deserves all the praise it's getting and much more.",10,0,0,22 December 2003
Donnie Darko," Incredible, Profound
","This movie took my breath away. I just finished watching it for the second time and have decided two things about it: 1) It is not a movie to be watched casually. Sit down and take the whole movie. 2) It is to be watched more than once. You notice a ton of things that you won't have noticed the first time. I can't say much that hasn't already been said, but I found the acting to be amazing on all fronts, special congrats to Mr. Patrick Swayze who's portrayal of the 'little-too-clean' self help guru Jim Cunningham was DEAD ON perfect and the Gyllenhaal siblings for being two of the most promising young actors in Hollywood that I've ever seen. The movie is billed as a horror move 'in the tradition of Final Destination...' and NOTHING could be further from the truth. Both movies deal with fighting destiny and that's it. Donnie Darko has some rather frightening moments, but it's not a frightening movie. The only reason it would keep you up all night would be if you were trying to unravel it's complex and profound plot, most especially the ending. The ending has received the most heat from critics of the movie who cite it as a cop-out or lacking any substance, but nothing could be further from the truth. I was a little skeptical after my first viewing, but just now I watched it again and so much more clicked. It still doesn't make complete sense, but I'm told if you watch it with commentary on the DVD the director explains a lot of it. The very end, as it shows everyone's gut reaction to the shocking event that the film ends on before they even know about it, is underscored by the song 'Mad World' performed by Gary Jules and is one of the most moving and genuinely sorrowful scenes I have ever seen in my life. 10/10",10,0,1,21 May 2003
