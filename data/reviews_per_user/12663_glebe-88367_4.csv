Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A wild ride!
","You have the wicked wit,the funky score,the hip-retro cultural artifacts and lots of non-stop,brace in your face action that is not to be missed.",6,6,9,13 September 2019
Fight Club," Bleak
","Seldom does a film elucidate the culpability of our culture,of our society, in the mayhem and madness we often find in everyday life.",10,3,4,20 December 2019
The Hateful Eight," QT does it again!
","This is a fine piece of storytelling - a mystery, western, and political drama - all artfully melded together by a seasoned crew and talented actors.The action is set in antebellum Wyoming, in the heart of a raging blizzard, in a frontier bar. Setting is very important here.The period is meaningful for the political currents that flow in nearly all the characters. Feelings about the American civil war are very up-front, with complicit atrocity present in nearly all the characters. The war brought out horrible things in these people, and we see how they deal with that shared knowledge, both personally and to each other.",10,1,3,18 December 2019
Platoon," Awe
","I have seen this movie easily a half a dozen times, and I find that the beauty of the film is how Platoon not only shares his innocence and purity with others, including the audience, he also manages to retain that innocence and purity through some very difficult times. As a Viet Nam veteran, and a college graduate of the late Sixties, I could of course personally relate to the various periods that Platoon endures. I would only mention that the skillful and seamless blending of music, action, and period costume was enthralling.",10,3,5,20 December 2019
