Skyfall," The Bigger they are, the harder they fall.
","Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and we all behold things subject to our own psyche, mood and life experience. My subjective view is such that Skyfall was a pastiche of the earlier Bond films, possibly slanted as a tribute on the 50th anniversary. Attractive enough but mostly a silly story. Silly is okay as entertainment, but you have to believe it in some way to be entertained. Daniel Craig as good an actor as he is, couldn't save this one and Javier Bardem went a good way to make the most of his character; but it went pear shaped as it moved along. Killing off the incredibly attractive Berenice Marlohe didn't help, they normally sacrifice a lesser role at that point, and keep the chosen attractive woman at Bond's side till the end, I would have been happy to watch her for a couple of hours and ignore the pitfalls of the story. I enjoyed the darker Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace, which let Daniel Craig pull more serious expressions and grunt more and talk less, with quite possibly the involvement of Paul Haggis adding some gravitas. I'll be very careful about jumping at the chance to see the next one. I'd hoped the Daniel Craig lead reinvention, like the latest Batman trilogy and the possible influence of the excellent Bourne series, would be an on going stream; but I'm no longer hopeful. Skyfall may have broken the billion dollar box office mark, and award forums have their own shortcomings: but like most thingsÂ…. just because it's popular, doesn't make it good.",6,2,5,12 January 2013
