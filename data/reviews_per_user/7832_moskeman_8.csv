The Avengers," The Avengers
","If you are a fan of The Avengers than you won't be disappointed. This movie is like a sequel for Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and Hulk all together. A lot of action, story is quite good, and when I've watched it I was 100% into it, no boring moments in the movie. There was no favoring of heroes, every one of them got their part in the movie, and they all have done a brilliant job. If you've never watched movies with Avengers heroes than you should really start asap. Iron Man movies have started all of this so you should start with that, and enjoy in brilliance of Tony Stark in performance of Robert Downey Jr, which was perfect for the role of Tony Stark, and my personally favorite Avenger. Thor is also incredible, Chris Hemsworth really nailed it, and this movie is like quite important for the story in the Avengers, so you shouldn't been missing this one, and Captain America is just quite interesting 'cause he is actually the first hero of the franchise who even went to fight in the World War II. And naturally, there's no person who doesn't like Hulk, and Mark Ruffalo is the best Hulk so far. I just can't wait for second and third movie, because it's just gonna be better and better. Enjoy!!",10,1,4,28 November 2013
Captain Marvel," Great movie!
","First of all, after reading so many bad reviews here without any facts or explanation why is movie so bad, made me even more eager to see the movie and enjoy, cause Marvel never dissapointed me so far. The worst Marvel movie would be the best in DCEU. And I don't hate DCEU, I feel sorry that they can get even close to Marvel, but to write so many hateful and wrong reviews is just sad. This one is definitely not the best MCU movie, but it is very good and just another hero introduction movie. You can see that Brie Larson didn't do anything similar in her career, but I find her like a really good choice for Captain Marvel. MCU needs to evolve and Captain Marvel is just that. I can't even imagine how much she evolved for all these years away from Earth, but she'll definitely be one of the main characters in Avengers End Game. Don't get discouraged with all these bad reviews, cause they are all fake. Can't wait to see it again.",9,1,5,13 March 2019
Aquaman," Not impressed
","As I expected, DC once more disappointed. To quit on Henry Cavill as Superman for this? Really? They killed it with too much colors and visual effects, like you're watching an animated movie in some points.. Really tried to like it, and I'll watch it few more times, but really shallow and clichÃ© movie.. Mixture of Indiana Jones, 20000 leagues under the sea, Journey to the center of the earth.. and many more.. Only Jack Sparrow was missing.. DCEU is quite dead..",5,1,1,26 January 2019
Don Jon," Good movie
","Well, this movie isn't something you're gonna remember after couple of years, but it's quite OK. Joseph Gordon-Levitt have surprised me a lot with his performance, 'cause he was always Tommy from 3rd Rock From the Sun for me, and in this movie he is a build up guy, with some new acting tricks.. Movie is very funny, you will certainly have a good laugh while watching it, but also, there is another side... Movie is talking about a man who thinks that porn is the real deal, and that everything in those movies is natural and true. Because of that he can't experience pleasure of real life sex 'cause it's not like in porn movies. He develops an addiction for masturbation, or maybe even obsession 'cause he spends a lot of time surfing on the internet in searching for the right clip, and even after a real sex he needs to watch pornography and masturbate. Basically, movie shows the bad sides of porn addiction.",7,1,2,1 December 2013
Bohemian Rhapsody," Great movie
","I am a huge fan of Queen and Freddie, I love everything about their music and they are one of my favorite bands, so with that bein said I must say that movie is really great, I loved it, especially cause May and Taylor were involved in it's making. To see at least a glimpse of their story is really great. And even now, after so many years since Freddie died, Queen is still very much alive and so is Freddie, in our hearts. Queen will leave forever and so will these guys.",8,2,2,26 January 2019
Black Panther," Too many bad reviews!!!
","I don't really like to write reviews, cause watching movies is a personal experience and every person may have different opinion. But I really don't like when people just give rating 1 to a movie that's good. It's not the best one in the MCU, but it's definitely something new. 
In my opinion, only one first movie in the MCU, for one particular character, that was really awesome, was the Iron Man. But if we compare Black Panther with Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange... it was completely the same, just an introduction to a character. I didn't compare it with the Guardians of the Galaxy cause Guardians are just different kind of story. They didn't bother to introduce you too much with the backgrounds of Star-Lord, Drax, Gamora, Groot and Rocket, they just mentioned it through the movie. 
Black Panther just introduced you with Wakanda, main characters, history, vibranium, technological advancement, tradition ... and it's just a beginning.",8,1,3,2 May 2018
Creed II," High hopes, big let down!
","I am a big fan of Rocky saga, and after second movie we all could expect that quality will drop as it is, because 4th and 5th movie were quite under the level that we used to in first three movies, 6th is just story for itself. Creed I was great, story is already seen but we all liked the idea of something new that has such a big foundation in previous movies. When I saw first trailer for this one I kinda expected something like this, but this movie, as it is, has maybe 30 minutes of relevant story and that's it. For me, it's a big disapointment, cause you watch the movie that is so predictable, and has no emotion at all. I am also a huge fan of boxing and I like movies about boxing, but this one is just so weak. I tried to like it, but it's quite boring and predictable. Another one with big bad Russians.",5,3,5,17 February 2019
Lucy," Great movie!!
","One more Luc Besson masterpiece!! I'm not sure if there's even one movie from him that I don't like, he's really amazing! This movie is really interesting, Scarlett Johansson (not a big fan) was really amazing, and the story is wonderful. In some moments reminded me of Transendence, but never mind, it's still very good movie. I just don't know why so much negative reviews for this movie, if you're not very smart to expand your thinking you should be watching Pride and prejudice or something like that.. I've even saw that people compared this movie with Marvel movies and their comments were hilarious, cause there's no way you can compare comic superhero with movie as this one. But never mind, I would just like to recommend this movie to people who like science, but also sci-fi, action, impossible things.. or just something new, and Luc Besson won't let you down. But to the ones who like soft romance, tragedy, broken heart, and movies with similar things to stick with movies like Valentine's Day, New Year's eve, Love actually.... Maybe the realistic rating would be 8, but since I'm a huge Luc Besson fan after watching Leon: The Professional I'll give him 10.",7,19,38,24 November 2014
