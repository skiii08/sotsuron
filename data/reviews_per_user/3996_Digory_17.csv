Blade Runner 2049," Blade Runner 2049 might be to Blade Runner as Aliens is to Alien
","And maybe to an extent Denis Villeneuve to James Cameron in achieving such a feat.When it was announced that a sequel was planned, I was the least enthusiastic. I felt that it was unnecessary and a forced cash-in on the resurgence of science fiction franchises like Prometheus, Mad Max, and Star Wars. After seeing the movie, one could say that the movie still checks out on the points mentioned above but what Denis Villeneuve has created is something truly special.The visuals are a wonder to behold especially in IMAX. The 3D employed here is subtle and immersive, appropriately so for a movie of this kind. The score is also superb, reminiscent of Vangelis score with a few touches from Hans Zimmer. I admired the amount of care given to the movie's established trademarks from the feel of the film down to the technical aspects.With a story that intrigues while expanding the universe, Blade Runner 2049 is a worthy equal to its predecessor. Seeing the trailers back then, it was hard to imagine they could pull it off but they succeeded on all fronts. In my opinion, this is the best film of 2017 so far.",10,2,9,8 October 2017
The Expendables 2," It succeeded on what it set out to do
","The only disappointment I had with this was that they weren't as many as I imagined. One of them was only in it for a while. With that out of the way I thought it was a very good action movie. Characters had their share of good scenes (albeit short) and the spectacular cameos made up for my only problem with the movie. I didn't find anything to dislike, it was the coming together of iconic action stars and seeing them in one big movie is simply worth it in itself. It was heavy with explosions and action scenes sprinkled with humor coming from banter between the stars. Popular action movie quotes were sporadic throughout the movie and there was one scene that played with them humorously. I believe I was smiling from the inside when I saw that scene. My expectations helped me enjoy the movie. I got what I came for and I think they succeeded what they set out to do: To kick butt in the most epic way possible.",7,1,5,27 August 2012
Batman Returns," Merry Christmas Alfred...
","It was around 1995 when I saw Batman Returns (I was five) and the image of the Penguin carrying an umbrella that functions as both a machine gun and sword (and many more) was iconic. I remember a lot from this movie than the first one. One of the reasons why I enjoy this is because of their choice of Keaton and his take on Batman even though this is his second time.Tim Burton skillfully depicts Gotham City the way I envisioned it, well at least way before Batman Begins came out. Without looking at the characters and Gotham itself, I could feel the 'gothic' ambiance which probably gave the city its name. Michael Keaton as Batman, although only second to Christian Bale for me, does a great job as the brooding creature of the night and as the civilized Bruce Wayne. But, from my observations, his role here seems reduced compared to the first, it felt like he only had a few lines. Speaking about roles, boy did Commissioner Gordon lost a lot of his already minor role. DeVito rules as the Penguin. You kind of pity him during the first parts of the movie then as it progresses you find him even more pitiful as a misunderstood villain. I guess Pfeiffer's Catwoman was right-on but I honestly didn't understand her primary role throughout the duration of the movie. Christopher Walken is wonderful as always. For some reason, he bears a slight resemblance to Jack Sparrow and even shows a hint of his personality here. Everything in this movie seems to fall into the right place if you disregard realism and errors like how the Penguin got a wacky replica of the Batmobile in just a few days (maybe it's possible), how a duck could work as an amphibian vehicle, why a member of the Penguin's circus gang had to fight Batman while swallowing a sword when it would be easier to hold it with his hands, how the bat-signal formed perfectly in the sky, etc. I believe Returns didn't get a lot of attention, so that sucks. Overall this movie is superb as a Batman film and, if you like, a Christmas film as well. It's better than Batman '89 in some ways but again it just lacked attention.",7,1,5,25 December 2008
Taxi Driver," Opens up a different side of loneliness.
","I thought this was an action movie at first but I quickly got over that and knew where the movie was going. It was easy to say it was a good movie.The way the cast played their roles was enough to understand what was going on without having to show it through dialogue. The conversations within the film are interesting rather than something to bear with. Some of them are funny and silly while some are ponderous and insightful.Maybe the only character driven film I completely enjoyed, not to mention relate to. Every character and scene is important in motivating DeNiro's decisions and subsequent actions. Having seen it, I have to say it's an important film that depicts one's isolation and it's dangerous effects. It's something to think about.",10,1,2,1 June 2010
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," I'd like to think of this as the last Terminator in the series.
","James Cameron was right, that was it. Sarah Connor with the help of the Terminator (and Miles Dyson) have destroyed Cyberdyne which changes the future. Judgment Day is inevitable my butt! The only reason they went with that was to capitalize its success, now they've messed it up.All they had to do was leave it. I don't mind the Sarah Connor Chronicles because it was in an alternate time.This movie is revolutionary. Not only did Cameron tinker with the time and space-traveling idea, he even added cybernetic organisms (robots) to make it even more interesting. Everything was done just right and the execution is an A++. I believe this movie raised Cameron's caliber to match that of Ridley Scott and Stanley Kubrick's. Truly an amazing work.Terminator will always be one of my favorite movies.",9,2,2,24 May 2009
Monsters vs. Aliens," Nothing new here
","Just because there are monsters and aliens in this film (which are CGI) doesn't give any assurance of a good film. What happened here was that they were too dependent on the concept of monsters and aliens that they gave little attention to the story. Development was limited to 4 not-so-interesting characters and the theme was very common (friendship, teamwork, etc.). A positive theme but they can always think of another, even better, one. Other animated movies seem to do it well.The characters I really liked only made an appearance in the first half of the movie, the other half focused on the friendship the 'monsters' were starting to have. A waste of a good idea.Maybe kids will enjoy this generic CGI film, but even my siblings (ages 6, 10, and 13) didn't like this movie. It was forgettable.",4,16,32,23 May 2009
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Should have stood on its own.
","I'm reading the novel now (still on the 111th page), and I realized how far this film deviated from the source material. But since I saw the movie first it gave me a different impression from those people who read the novel beforehand. First was the characters (Every time I read a page with Ian in it, I couldn't stop but think of Jeff Goldblum. I enjoyed Goldblum in JP and albeit more somber this time for obvious reasons, it showed a better side of him). Another was prediction, I wondered whether this character who appeared in the movie would have the same fate in the book. Third, the lack of the characters from the novel made it look lonely regardless of the appearances of interesting replacements because character development was minimal (not to mention a blur).The novel had a lot of potential for a great movie. But a remake would sound too premature at this point. JP IV is in the works, too, as I've heard.The Lost World should have been an inspiration by the novel rather than the adaptation. Well, they did mention it was 'loosely based'..oh well. The story was engaging. The T-Rex's stroll around San Diego was great fun. Effects: wonderful. Everything was in its place...except for the loose adaptation thing.By the way the first JP is kind of in par with this (though I say JP was a wee bit better, just a weeeee bit).",7,0,1,6 May 2009
Schindler's List," A great movie that displays the best and worse of humanity
","1993 was a great year for Steven Spielberg. Just after the release Jurassic Park, he followed with Schindler's List. I'm not a huge sucker for biographical movies, preferring sci-fi and fictional in general but once in a while there are a few instance where biographical films catch my attention. It's been around for a while and I've heard great things about the movie, not to mention the awards and making it to movie lists. It was only until I found a copy of the film in a video store that I considered to finally watch it.As with biographical films, I was prepared for a slow-paced movie that might bore me. With a 3-hour running time, I felt it was going to exhaust me by the end of the movie. It was not the case, however.I've read of how bad the concentration camps are but how they are depicted in this film was far worse to how I imagined them. There's a sense of despair throughout the movie but Schindler's display of selflessness and humanity showed me the power of kindness in the midst of evil.Acting was great all throughout. I was fascinated with the black- and-white approach but I do understand that it was a way of making the violence a bit tolerable.Having seen it I can really say this is classic that deserves the praise it got. This movie showed me, on both extremes, the tendency of good and evil men. A powerful movie that should not be missed.",10,15,23,27 August 2012
Toy Story," It was a privilege witnessing this film-making achievement.
","Pixar started with a big bang: Toy Story.I loved this film as a kid and all the more as an adult. Every moment in this film is memorable, great or small. Don't tell me you don't remember parts like Andy's playtime with Mr. Potatohead as the villain, that mosquito on Buzz's visor, Pizza Planet, or at least one of the twisted toys.The way the story is put together is simple yet clever. The characters are lovable and are all equally important to the story.I may not have realized back then that I was seeing the first cgi animated feature film but I am somewhat glad I didn't know about that. Having to enjoy the film sincerely is way better than that. It's still a privilege seeing this on it's original date.",10,1,1,7 May 2010
Avatar," This is the BIG one.
","James Cameron's Avatar is the reason why I love movies. Avatar revolutionized my viewing experience once more just as Star Wars did.Starting with the plot and characters, others were right about the lack of originality in the story and some underdeveloped characters. I thought the characters weren't for us to know them but to 'feel' them. It was as if I was with Jake and Neytiri every step of the way, it was like a 'bond' as one of the movie's many themes suggests. I thought the story was told very well.I haven't seen Dances with Wolves but I could compare the film's story to Disney's Pocahontas. You could easily point out who is mirroring who and pretty much what's going to happen to them. Still, this was executed wonderfully that even if you knew where it's all going you still feel the thrill. Somewhere in the middle I lost my way for a while then quickly got back as things started heating up. I pretty much understand now why some people didn't like the movie for it's plot and character development. Overall having seen it my way, it's Epic. Acting is credible on both the live and computerized characters. The indigenous Na'vis looked and acted so real that you'd sometimes think them as better actors than the real ones. Not that the real actors did a bad job or anything like that.The visuals are nothing I've seen of before. I almost forgot to take a breath, my brain was stimulated to the awesomeness that is Pandora. A very unique and memorable experience. Ten years in the making resulted in nearly flawless detailing. It's worth every buck. This isn't just eye candy, it's an eye buffet.",9,14,23,18 December 2009
Pulp Fiction," Instantly became my favorite
","It's amazing how the trivial dialogue that barely advances the story keeps you attentive just because they're interesting to know about. The non-chronological story told in chapters is also a great technique. It gives the movie a unique feel, like reading a comic-book or reading a novel where the reader gets impatient and skips to the action. On top of the story and dialogue, it's got the right amount of action, a great deal of comedy, and a memorable soundtrack. Quentin Tarantino is at his peak form with this movie.",10,0,2,27 August 2012
WALL·E," An endearing journ-e
","Wall-E never got my attention when it came to the theaters, thanks to the trailer that gave me only a little insight of the movie. Anyway, my dad and my brother wanted to watch this movie. And since there was nothing to do at home and it was kind of sad to see only the two of them watching it, I decided to tag along. The first parts of the movie were dry, if you know what I mean, it was all dust and rust and I was about to get sick until Eve came to the scene. At that point I began to admire the story and even the elements that I wasn't accustomed to like the emphasized romance and the cute moments that came out of it. It somehow revolutionized my perspective on romantic movies.Well done once again, Pixar!!! 9/10",9,1,4,4 January 2009
Despicable Me," A Must-Watch-...
","A cute lighthearted movie with a lot of laughs. I have to admit this film had more comedy compared to Toy Story 3. The voice actors do a very good job with their characters. With the exception of Steve Carrell (of course) and Miranda Cosgrove, I had a hard time pointing out which cast member voiced who throughout the film because they altered their voices so well. The movie has its touching moments that tickles the tear glands. One thing I liked about this movie is that it sways away from predictability, somewhat.It's a cute movie and I would definitely watch everything if I catch it on cable TV.",8,0,1,12 September 2010
Blade Runner," Dystopia: Welcome to the future (Final Cut)
","Blade Runner draws strength from its mystery both inside and outside the movie.It's not an enjoyable movie. It's bleak and claustrophobic especially when the scenes take place in the busy streets. There's a sense of despair to it all. The fact that it evokes an emotion is testament to how well the sets were designed.The movie's weakness might have to be the plot, I do feel like the story takes a backseat to the visuals. The story is rather thin, only layered by the different versions. But it could be that the story serves as a veil to the more important aspects of the film which is its message.Overall, the movie is fantastic and the enigmatic nature of the film's production make it a huge draw for viewers like me.",10,0,2,21 May 2009
Toy Story 3," Pixar holds nothing back in this final installment of our childhood movie.
","I've had a streak with mediocre and fairly entertaining movies this summer and thankfully Toy Story 3 ended it. This movie had the laughs, the thrills, and at the end of it all you'll be struggling to keep yourself from shedding tears. I don't care if I make it sound overrated or hyped up but what I saw was what I saw: A sequel that lives up to the franchise and so much more.The voice acting is lively and even for a sequel that is darker compared to its predecessors, the vibrant new characters fill up the screen wonderfully. No longer did I think about Tom Hanks and Tim Allen and co. I was seeing Woody and Buzz and the gang playing out their parts, they all do a great job bringing our beloved friends to life.I have to be honest, I didn't get teary-eyed by the movie's end but my heart just melted with the emotions. It is a worthy conclusion to my childhood favorite.An early but very strong contender for the Best Animated Feature and, if things go the way we fans want it, Best Picture Oscar. Simply one of the best movies of this year.",10,4,7,19 June 2010
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Nostalgia at its best...
","My dad saw Star Wars back in '77 and remembered it pretty well. He introduced me to the wonderful world of Star Wars, narrating to me parts of the story. Unfortunately he forgot one scene was pivotal and gave it away (spoiling the movie, but I was a kid back then so I didn't care). Sometime around 1997 ( I was eight), it was re-released in theaters and my dad had a chance to show me the masterpiece he had seen a couple of decades ago. Just like any good father would do, he brought me to the theater to watch the first of the epic trilogy. It was an unforgettable experience, especially when KFC was promoting the movie through their 'Chuckie' meals. Wow and yum.I couldn't really describe how I felt back then except being excited and free from anything unpleasant (I'm an escapist).I've seen a lot of good movies and occasionally, I got hooked into them but when I got back to my senses, I always go back to Star Wars. Star Wars has helped shape my view on movies.I'm not going to be dramatically cliché and say that this is 'more than a movie'. I'm gonna go with Star Wars having a great impact on my childhood and the culture, which it really did. That was still cliché wasn't it?",10,0,0,29 May 2009
Jurassic Park," Still astounds visually
","I didn't see it on its release unfortunately so I won't be able to experience it on the big screen until a re-release. I have great respect for Steven Spielberg as a filmmaker and this would be one of the movies I would present as one of my reasons. I'm aware it is based on the novel but I won't be comparing the two because I haven't read the book yet. I only found out about the source several years after I saw this movie. Since the movie relies on thrills with a large scale, the story is expected to take a backseat. As far as storytelling goes, it is good enough to set the whole movie up (maybe like Jaws except Jaws, in my opinion, had more character development). That doesn't mean the characters are not likable. With a cast consisting of Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum, and several well-known actors, it adds more fun to the whole situation seeing them dish out their personalities amidst the danger.As for the effects, there's not much I can say that hasn't been said before. It's innovative and just a wonder seeing dinosaurs come to life, however inaccurate they might be. From the seemingly peaceful brontosaurus to the frightening tyrannosaurus rex down to the smallest (yet dangerous) of these prehistoric creatures, I can see there's was a lot of work done and it really paid off in a big way. Escapism on a whole other level.",8,0,1,27 August 2012
