E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Completely overrated 'Kid's' film
","I saw E.T. when i was 12. Scared me senseless. I know, it's supposed to be a sweet kid's film, but it seemed every scene was so dark and ominous that i don't remember feeling good the whole time i watched it. When the boy flashes the light on E.T., causing the alien to freak in that high pitched creepy moan, I wanted to get the hell out of the theater. The film gave me nightmares for weeks. About a year ago i watched E.T. again. I thought, well, I'm older now and maybe I was just in the wrong mood when i saw it the first time. Nope. It still gave me the creeps. This time around the alien seemed too fake with his animatronic neck elongation and that overly sympathetic whine. The one time I almost laughed was when it he she whatever got drunk wearing those high heals and the wig, but even then i thought it was kind of pathetic to beg for laughs with such a tired method as drunkenness. And the film was too freaking dark again. Maybe i need to watch it on DVD to avoid the poor transition the film made on VHS. Then again NO.",3,11,23,11 February 2001
