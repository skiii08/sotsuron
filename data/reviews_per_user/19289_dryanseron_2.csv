Hereditary," Is this what a 'good horror movie' is supposed to be?
","Yo', what the **** was this ****? This was quite possibly the worst horror movie i've ever seen in my entire ******* life. I get the need for build up, but this thing felt like it was a 2yo playing the architect for a military bunker in the case of nuclear warfare, the result won't exist. I am generous because I kinda thought the acting was ok-ish.",1,1,5,13 July 2019
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," What even is this?
","The animation part with the story of the japanese girl was fine, the part at the beginning was halfway decent and the highlight of this hot piece of garbage was a scene where the protagonist spanks a guy with a sword? I am not picky when it comes to movies but damn this is one giant mess that should never have existed in the first place, and I really, really wanted to like this movie.",5,1,7,5 April 2019
