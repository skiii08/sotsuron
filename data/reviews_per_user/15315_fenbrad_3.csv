Hereditary," does what it says on the tin
",This film was not so much horrifying but distressing. It had a very dark feel to it and a real sense of foreboding. I did not think it had much of an affect on me because i do watch a lot of horror films....but i have to say after watching this film i did have a nasty nightmare! So it did do its job for that i have to give it a 9,9,4,9,19 June 2018
Inception," shallow
",I have tried to watch this film twice now but found it boring and shallow. I could not relate to any character and did not care about the outcome. Why are we supposed to care about the fate of this man and his shallow mission? It is not like he was doing anything important or life changing. Over rated and like some have said style of substance,3,2,2,2 June 2018
Her," it is a warning
",Everyone seems to have a different take on the message this film is trying to convey. For me this film is a warning about technology and the dangers of living in a fantasy world. I did not see it as a love story....rather a story about a very sad man who was wasting his life and avoiding reality. Saying that i enjoyed this film a lot and found myself squirming in my seat watching some scenes ha i i am sure people know what i am talking about...really good film that makes you think,8,0,0,4 June 2018
