Walk the Line," Just another film to jump on the bandwagon...
","Unfortunately, I was busy the night of the Academy Award's, but when I was told of the Oscars that 'Walk the Line' had won, I was appalled. My initial reaction was 'How is that possible! It was just 'Ray' with white people!'. Surprisingly, it had been referred to as such at the awards ceremony. This movie really does follow the basic pattern that Ray did. If this movie came out before Ray or maybe 10 or so years after, it may have been appreciated, but this movie gives off a flair of being produced for the sole reason of imitating a successful, previous, better movie, Ray. Not to be offensive towards Reese Withersppon, I admit she is a wonderful actress, but she cannot be taken seriously in this role. I would get emotionally involved with Pheonix's character, and then I would be interrupted by our favorite ditz from Legally Blonde. Terribly sorry for all those who do not appreciate this review or feel otherwise about the movie. This comment is not intended to offend any of you, it is merely intended to say some bad choices were made in the execution of this film.",1,6,19,27 June 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," The Best Movie I've Seen in A While...
","This movie has everything a good movie should have. There are parts where you want to cry, and parts where you laugh so hard you end up crying. Honestly, I have never heard a theater laugh so incredibly hard. This is a great family movie, even though it's rated R- the only mildly questionable scenes involve a man snorting heroin and use of the F-word a couple of times. This movie really is incredible, and makes every member of the audience feel connected to every problem of these dysfunctional people. Steve Carell, who is more commonly known for Anchorman and The 40-Year Old Virgin, is absolutely stunning in this as a character he does not usually play- suicidal, quirky, and depressed. Think twice about not seeing this movie- it is by far the funniest movie you will see all year!",10,1,4,23 September 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Incredible and quite intellectual.
","This movie without any doubt deserves to be on the top 250 list. Although I had to watch the movie about 4 times to fully understand it, I was surprised beyond all reason to discover that in fact this movie isn't random after all. Once you understand everything, you'll realize that EVERYTHING fits together like a puzzle. One piece can't stand alone without another. I especially loved the casting. This is an unusual but fitting part for Jim Carrey, since it is not a flat-out comedy like most of his other films. It's also an excellent role for Kate Winslet- her diversity as an actress in outstanding. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is good at unraveling intellectual plots or if you aren't, just like being confused.",10,2,5,7 July 2005
