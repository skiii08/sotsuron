Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," less than amusing by a long shot
","This film was horrible. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It was an obscene, offensive, and pathetic attempt at entertainment. My biggest disappointment was that I actually paid to go see this waste of time. I think I may have laughed...twice...throughout the whole movie. It just wasn't funny. It wasn't a true documentation of America either, (if anyone has even tried to credit it for that) Is it supposed to make us ashamed of ourselves for having manners or not agreeing with homosexuality? Sorry, but I will never be ashamed to live in America for those things. Overall I'd rate this movie a ZERO! I can't believe it was nominated for awards!! What is wrong with people these days? What in the world is so amusing about college kids getting wasted, naked men wrestling, and masturbation? This is a pitiful 'documentary type' satire movie that simply is not funny. I'm sorry I devoted my time to it.",Null,2,5,5 March 2007
