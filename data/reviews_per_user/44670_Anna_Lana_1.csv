Catch Me If You Can," Good acting, Great movie
","This was a wonderful movie, although some of the more adult scenes could be limited and the end was rather predictable.  I saw it with some friends, who also enjoyed it quite a bit.  Leonardo DiCaprio did a great job, boosting his image after such titles as The Beach...  Tom Hanks was great as well. I can't wait to see it again once it is released on VHS or DVD.  Somewhat long, but it feels like 3 smaller movies all rolled into one large package. Younger people may not understand most of what is going on, but the story is good nonetheless.  Bits of humor are added to make it even more crowd-appealing.  Overall, it was a very good movie, a good reenactment of the true story (at least from what I've heard), and it deserves some recognition.",10,1,2,19 January 2003
