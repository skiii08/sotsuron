The New World," Review for The New World
","I am watching this film for my history through film class. I have to write a review on it.The film is about Pocahontas and how she came to a new world. She meets a man named John Smith in the beginning and they later part. She moves to Jamestown where she learns English. She meets another man named john rolfe and marries him. I noticed they dressed different due to the different time period. The natives focused a lot on connection with nature. The age difference with the male and females did not matter due to it being in the older times. There was also cannibalism at some point throughout the movie due to no food. There was nothing really that made me question the accuracy of the film. I dont know much about Pocahontas. The ages were off thats all i really know. Some connections I can make from other movies Ive seen of Pocahontas is the disney version. She meets john smith. Three things I liked were the actors. I also liked the scenery they did for the natives. Another thing I liked was the costumes they used. One thing I didnt like were the camera angles. Overall I thought the movie was interesting. I liked it in general. The overall story of the movie was good. I like the actors that were in there as well, I think they did a good job.",6,1,1,30 August 2018
Walk the Line," Walk the Line
","This was a great movie and I thought the overall story of Johnny Cash was interesting. I've only heard of Johnny Cash and have never listen to his music. Throughout the whole film it is about the life of Johnny Cash, it starts out as him as a child and you learn about his upbringing from there. During this part of history, I know that pills and other drugs were a big thing. There was little information on them besides that they'd have you up for days. We currently have the same problem, with all the prescription drugs we hand out but that's besides the point. The main characters are actors Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon I have never seen them in other movies, but I felt like they did an excellent job as acting like the characters Johnny Cash and June Carter. Overall I thought the movie was super good and I would recommend people to watch it.",9,1,1,24 January 2019
Miracle," miracle
","Miracle is a good movie about the 1980 winter Olympics. This movie is about a how the US hockey team defeated the soviets it was the USA second gold medal. Throughout the film the hockey team goes through many trials, but they use their weaknesses and turn them into strengths. This movie seemed pretty spot on with the depiction of how difficult it was to win against this team, and how good it felt to win. The director to this movie is Gavin O'Connor, he did a good job on making you feel anxious or jumpy on whether or not the puck was going to score. I have never seen any other movie by this director but he did a great job with this film. Overall I thought this was a great movie and I would recommend it.",8,0,0,25 April 2019

","This was a good history and baseball movie. It portrays both worlds of how African Americans were living and how baseball played a roll in Americans lives. This movie is a about the first black man to join a professional baseball team Jackie Robinson. He goes through a lot of trials of multiple individuals and even his teammates being racist towards him. The history part of this movie is very interesting, you get to see how racist people were even when it came down to a sport. It's interesting to see now that most out sports are mainly African Americans. Chadwick Bozeman plays Jackie Robinson and he does a great job at doing so. He also plays in another great film black panther. Another actor that was great was Harrison Ford, I've never seen him in other movies by I've heard he's in Star Wars. My favorite scene from this movie would have to be when his teammates start to stand up for Jackie and begin to accept him. I would watch this movie again, I always saw previews of it I just never watched it. I would recommend it to friends and friend and overall thought they did a good job.",8,1,2,5 February 2019
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid
","I'm watching this movie for my history through film class. We are doing reviews on movies. The plot of the movie is about two robbers who robbed a train and it went wrong. They run all the way to Bolivia where they rob banks. They have multiple people trying to find them. What I noticed about the movie that is because of how long ago it was made was the sound quality. It didn't sound that good when it came to voices. I thought it was still good though. The acting was good as well. They did a good western impression. There is nothing I question about the historical accuracy. I know this is supposed to be a legend. There are no connections I made with other movies. This is the first Western style movie I've watched. Three things I liked were the actors. I liked the over plot and story. I liked the action it came with too. I thought the movie was good overall. I liked it, it had some good humor and action. It was an interesting movie. I wouldn't mind watching another movie with the same actors.",7,2,2,23 October 2018
Hidden Figures," Hidden Figures
","This was a good movie and shows how much of a crucial role African Americans played during the space race. Throughout this film it tells the story of African Women at NASA, Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson. The most noticeable one would have to Katherine Johnson. This part of history is an interesting part of history to me and sadly during this part, African Americans are never talked about during the space race when taught in schools. These 3 women played a huge role when it came to sending man into space but are hardly ever talked about. That is why I find this movie to be so interesting. The director to this movie is Theodore Melfi, he did a great job at camera angles and really showing the power between these women. The main actors are Taraji P. Henson, Janelle Monae and Octavia Spencer. These are great actors and always do a good job on their role. I thought this was a great movie and should be shown in more history classes. It shows how effective these women were during that time period.",8,0,4,15 March 2019
Wonder Woman," Wonder Woman
","I am writing this review for my history through film class. We are writing reviews on movies. The plot of the movie is a princess of the amazons named Diana who is trained to fight. She meets a man named Steve and he tells her about the problems being causes in the real world. She leaves the Amazons and goes and fights through the war. What I noticed about the movie because of the time period was the special effects and the technology. The special effects were really good, so was the acting. There is nothing that made me question the historical accuracy of the film. There are no connections I made with any other movies with this one. I thought it was unique and told a different story. Three things I liked were the actors. I like the overall story. I also liked the special effects. One thing I didnt like was Steve Trevor dying. I thought the movie was good. I found it interesting and entertaining. I would want to see more movies with other actors.",9,3,4,15 November 2018
Thirteen Days," Thirteen days
","Thirteen days was an interesting movie. This movie is about the Cuban missile crisis. It's interesting to see that what we know the world today could have been ended. I had already knew about the Cuban missile crisis and the tough decisions America had to make on what they wanted to do. This part of history is interesting to me, because it shows how something so small yet so big can lead to crisis. This is the first movie I see on the Cuban missile crisis and it was good. The actors to this movie I have never seen them in any other movies, but they were good actors. The actor who played John F Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) played a good role and I think it fitted him well. I like how this movie was very historical and it represents a good depiction of how the United States was. This movie is good for learning about the Cuban missile crisis. I don't think I'd watch this on my own time but it is a good watch if you are ever curious about this side of history.",7,0,0,13 February 2019
Apollo 13," Apollo 13
",This was a movie that was a very good because it actually happened. When I was watching this movie all I could think about was how people were really devoted to get onto the moon. They ran simulations after simulations. This movie has a great story and really focuses on the idea that they had to do this. Apollo 13 is about 3 men from nasa trying to get to the moon. I had already known what had happened on apollo 13 from my history classes but it was good to actually get to watch it. The history part of this movie will always be interesting to me because you can truly see how much we have developed. The director to this movie is Ron Howard. He does a great job on the video shots and everything else. The main actor to this movie is Tom Hanks he plays the lead role in this film and I think he did a great job. For most of the movies he's in I always tend to like them. Overall I thought this was a great movie. I would recommend it to other people. This is a movie I have seen multiple times and it never gets old.,8,0,1,19 March 2019
Back to the Future," Back to the Future
","I have never seen this movie, only have heard about it but I regret not seeing it earlier. It is a really good movie. In the movie Back to the Future, Marty travels 30 years back and has to fix a mistake he made involving his parents. I thought seeing the history of how 30 years could really change how store, cars, music and even what people wear was very interesting. All the styles of everything had changed. It makes me wonder how it would be 30 years from now would be and even how it was before. The director of this movie is Robert Zemeckis, I have never heard of him but I think he did a great job on this movie, especially since it was made in 1985. This is the first movie I also see with these actors, I would like to see more of there movies. Overall I thought this movie was great. I would recommend people to watch it even though I'm pretty sure almost everyone has seen it.",9,0,0,30 January 2019

",I am watching this movie for my history through film class. We are writing reviews on movies. The plot of the movie is a boxer during the great depression trying to make through. He is fighting for his wife and kids. He does everything to try and support his family. I noticed that because of the time period the special effect ere pretty good. The make up and blood looked realistic. The technology they used to make this movie were also good as well. Nothing made me question the historical accuracy. Everything was on the correct timeline. There are no connections I've made with any other movies. I dont really watch boxing movies. Three things I liked was the overall story. I liked the actors I think they did well. I also liked how it ended. There wasnt one thing I didnt like. I thought the movie overall was great. I liked it and found it interesting. I would want to see more movies with the actors. As well as with the director.,8,1,1,4 December 2018
