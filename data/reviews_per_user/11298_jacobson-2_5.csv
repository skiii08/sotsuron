Blade Runner 2049," Do the homework - love the movie.
","Blade Runner 2049 did the work. Now the public really needs to watch any version of the original prior to seeing BR 2049 or a few things will be missed. And one could also watch Close Encounters, the Shining, Clockwork Orange, 2001, Interstellar, and yet another version of Blade Runner (Narration Original + Director's Cut) and then ... oops Boy and His Dog, and THX-1138, and 5th Element and Minority Report. Top with a listen to the Blade Runner original soundtrack (Vangelis). Then - this effort will be matched and appreciated by those who did the work.",10,1,12,17 October 2017
Love Actually," Lousy is Eternal
","I suspect...This movie was written in under a half hour, over drinks at 2am. Totally cast and boarded with only the help of just a little too much amber liquid and financed by the gullible. Its like eight really bad story lines that never made it past the first green light distilled in hopes that combined they might get some traction. It was a grand bargain that won the hearts of many - but lousy is eternal. Shame. Enjoy the revised trailer at:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giq7KdN4X-Y",1,4,6,24 December 2015
12 Strong," It's a start.
","Having served in Afghanistan and familiar with the geography of the movie there is the overall disappointment of not having anything filmed which is even close to the amazing topography of Mazir - I learned nothing about the beginnings of operation enduring freedom other than all this took place in the north - which I did not know. As well - I was not aware of this first effort in the US response to September 11 and the quasi collaborative approach to an attempt on Al Qaeda. Nice to know. 
Otherwise the plot is just a handwritten-on-a-napkin approach to a logistically complicated effort without any depth - Action! - special Forces Identified, 9/11 happens, sad goodbye to family, insertion to country, three campaigns to deliver air support, bad guy identified by killing women, good guy suffers sucking chest wound, bad guy gets it, everyone makes it out alive, warm hello to family, actual group photo during credits - scene! 
One hopes that eventually the likes of Spielberg, Stone, Kubrick and Coppola will bring their warcraft to these middle eastern operations - ( though we do have Three Kings, Zero Dark Thirty and Restrepo ) but this was never WWII or vietnam - this was 'war during pokemon and Halo II' - a better story than 12 strong has been told by Phil Klay's 'redeployment' and in such tales I believe we will find the seminal storylines of the Bush era wars.",4,1,2,28 July 2018
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," A Pithy Comment to the Spoiled Children of Tolkien - the Beethoven of Fantasy
","Really ?'The Interview' gets a 10 in spite of no viewings from a regular audience (so far) and this long awaited and creatively and lovingly story told is wobbling because thousands of folks might have read the source material at least once in a lifetime (or not at all) - and are left wanting? I got three reminders for comparison:STAR WARS Episode 1 The Jar Jar MenaceEpisode 2 Something AttacksEpisode 3 A Stiff Transition Really? We winge on the failure of Lucas to realize a franchise and ultimately destroy the origins of his own original story and fail to see how cleanly Jackson stayed on the path (beware the moon) of JRR.Honestly - does we remember the days when this whole HOBBIT franchise was up for grabs and Jackson didn't have a chance at it?It was the cover of several EW magazines for years. Ya a bunch of spoiled children who think ya could of done better. Really?I am a five time vet of reading the book and two time out loud reader - it was amazing and fun to see the elaborations on the text and the fabricated parts almost always worked and added to the plot. What are you hoping for - a wooden reprisal in keeping with the first Harry Potter films?Still buzzed from the entirety and ingenuity and experience of the film ...Guilty pleasure? Nope. A satisfaction that I do not recall having with any of the previous films and uncertain as to why. Of course we know our reviews and impressions are incomplete until the extended edition is released. And on that note:The first had 13 extra minutesThe second had 26 extra minutesDo the math The third (and sixth) and final = might just have 52 extra minutes. Pllllll. Why don't you kiss her already?Say what?Aww- youth is wasted on the wrong people. In conclusion. What is it with our culture that perpetuates this ongoing failure to 'like' while simultaneously walks on to the next thing 2 minutes later?How do we cultivate appreciation for the hard won?These movies were dreaded upon (initial) announcement and then surprised us all with scope, faithfulness, and grandeur. Easily the best of this trilogy - and not a greater story compared to the former - but neither is the book - so lets be real. If we want to rant - then lets rant about the complete absence of Tom Bombadil - right? And why didn't Gandalf share his pipe with Bilbo at the end?George Kennedy at least gave Clint a beer at the top following his great climb. What a Bogart. And why does it take so long for another story from JRR like GOT to come along before we enjoy this capturing of the epic, the important, and the ultimately relevant?Let us be occasionally thankful. Tolkien was the Beethoven of fantasy.I'm guessing this is the final Tolkien film for a time in my lifetime. And Jackson's riff is the one to beat.Looking forward to the 'mad max' round two remake in the decades ahead. Can't wait to see it.",10,7,15,24 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Media Res Redux
","So this movie starts out just like the original - media res.We get the middle first.If you ever watched an episode of Alias - you know this is JJ's favorite plot device. And then there is Lucas' own decision to begin with Episode IV. With 30 years of in-between, my bet is number eight will not be a carbon copy of TESB but a major series of flashbacks telling the untold stories of Han and Leia, Luke, and how C3P-O has a red arm.It remains obvious that a significant contribution to this film was the research and mining of the original for subtleties which made it so endearing - (incredible scale of ships - throwaway appearances of nocturnal creatures - the little empire bot that zips around the floor) these I personally appreciate and do not scorn. Thank you all for not spoiling the plot points until my own viewing with family - more surprised that I did not know what would happen than with what did happen. Haters gotta hate - and lovers are blind. If you really want to get excited - bring back the Cooper and true 70 MM. With all the other indulgences we afford ourselves, why can't we have a great theater anymore? It was good yarn and at times comfort food - did miss the 20th Century theme but even I can add that later. Expecting to retire around Episode 12 or so - which should be about half way through the franchise. Media Res Redux",6,3,9,24 December 2015
