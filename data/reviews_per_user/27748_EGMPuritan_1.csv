The New World," Historical revisionism and Indian paganism = A New World Flop
","This movie was a field of [...]! What do I mean? ....It is a mixture of historical revisionism, New Age Indian paganism, Jungian psycho-analysis, and the Hollywood idol of naturalistic romanticism woven together into a twisted attempt to portray the life of Pocahantas. This was definitely not The New World and the founding of Jamestown! This was a New Age pagan view of the life of Pocahantas. The script was completely ludicrous and unhistorical, almost a dream world of stupid and silly comments about a supposed love relationship between John Smith and the Indian Princess Pocahantas. I think only illiterate queebs and brainless crack heads could have been at all pleased by the lack of serious conversation, dialogue and character development in this movie. Anyway, this twisted and romanticized version of John Smith and Pocahantas has now become a common lie and fabrication repeated by the historical idiots and ignoramuses in Hollywood. It is actually turning into some kind of Hollywood cult folklore! I suppose the Disney version was probably more entertaining, even though it was just as stupid and perverse! There is not a single factually true or even historically plausible conversation throughout this entire movie, or the Disney version for that matter. Why don't these Hollywood directors and producers ever read history??? I suppose it is their hostile New Age paganism and hatred of real American history. The movie moreover portrays the English settlers as being a bunch of dirty, filthy, confused, and violent hooligans who come to invade the Paradise of the innocent Indians. What a load of [...]! The movie therefore tries to gloss over the barbaric and savage perversities of the Indians and even tries to make them seem virtuous and innocent. More Hollywood paganism! Even the music though was ridiculously out of place. A slow movement from a well known Mozart piano concerto written in the 1780's and a piece from the German Romantic Richard Wagner's Das Rheingold written in the 1860's was a stupid and brainless idea. What was James Horner thinking here? Mozart, 19th century German Romanticism, oh yes, then glazed over with a touch of 20th century American minimalism all scored to supposedly portray the New World Discovery and the founding of Jamestowne???? I have no idea what makes these Hollywood producers such brainless [...]! In the early 17th century, Thomas Tallis, William Byrd, and John Dowland were the famous English composers!!! Don't they know that??? It would have been much better and honorable and historically accurate if Horner had included such music into the score. And what about the cinematography? So what? I can watch the travel channel! All in all, this movie is a terrible flop, a cinematic load of [...] - very similar to the pile of [...] that John Rolfe and Pocahantas are portrayed (late in the movie) as having to trudge through on their way back to the house. This is exactly what I was feeling as I was watching this movie, that I was trudging through a field of [...]! Now I have to go and clean off my shoes.",1,2,7,10 May 2006
