Vertigo," Hitchcock's Best
","Normally I would hesitate in dubbing one film a director's masterpiece, especially the likes of Hitchcock; but there's no doubt here. When I saw `Vertigo' for the first time, I was already well-acquainted with Hitchcock. I'd seen `North by Northwest', `Rear Window', `Psycho', and `Rebecca', each several times, before seeing `Vertigo'. Now having seen `Vertigo' several times, the jury of my mind is out. It's the best. The entire cast is at its best. Let people flap their lips about `It's a Wonderful Life', `Vertigo' contains James Stewart's greatest performance. His obsession even takes physical form, his eyes gleam with it, and his brow glistens with sweat in anger and in fear. His performance climbing the steps of the tower at the end of the film is magic. Kim Novak has hardly the resume of Stewart, but her performance even surpasses his at times. The way her face tightens in her sadness, she is even divine in the scenes where she is purposely distant from the scene. A seldom used Barbara Bel Geddes is also good.These two stars alone mean a great movie. But the plot, and the man who molded it, are the stars here. The quirky plot gives me chills from its air of creativity and ultimate excellence of being. This tale of obsession forces me to watch the film over and over, indulging in the plot twists every time.Incredible, innovative camera-work from the `master' make this one of the great technical achievements of movie history.What else to say? 10/10 stars.",10,2,4,29 October 2000
The Sound of Music," Trite but True
","`The Sound of Music' has taken a great deal of flack for its corny musical ways. A lot of that flack is deserved. The songs are forced into the film with conspicuously bad results. The `choreography' is so despicably contrived that it isn't a wonder that stomachs turn at the sight of the infamous introduction. Lastly, Julie Andrews is a nightmare full of hot air.This film can pass family viewing standards for its cute plot, with cute children singing cute songs. However, only two things hold my interest as a mature viewer. The first is a dynamite performance by Christopher Plummer, the second is director Robert Wise. Still with momentum from his production of `West Side Story', Wise takes this silly musical and makes it into the memorable masterpiece it is today. No matter how ineffectual Julie Andrews is, or how Ernest Lehman's screenplay falls apart, the production remains remarkable. The cinematography is beautiful and complex in scope with Todd-AO film doing credit to the film.But just when it seems that Wise and company have been defeated by a bad plot, the film comes alive with maturity in the nick of time. First with a sensational romance then with a nail-biter of a dramatic finale. In the space of one hour I decided that I might actually recommend this film to someone over the age of 10.In fact this is a great film with something for everyone, and good luck getting those songs out of your head. 8/10 stars.",8,2,10,4 November 2000
Casablanca," One of the Greats, though time goes by.
","What to say of Casablanca? It's one of the most beloved films of all time, its romance and immortal lines have brought it into history. It's really an ordinary film, even Ingrid Bergman has so commented. The cinematography is nothing to gawk at, nor does the film possess any godsends of technical achievement, nor was it expected of run-of-the-mill director Michael Curtiz. The play it was based on, Everybody Comes to Rick's, was second-rate even in 1942. But the acting is something special. At the time, Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Paul Henreid were hardly household names. Bogart, then just establishing himself as a serious actor, nearly lost the lead role to actor George Raft. Raft refused to have a nobody like Ingrid Bergman be his costar. While Bogart lost that year's Oscar to Paul Lukas, this is his most famous if not best performance. Bergman was passed over come Oscar night, but she too gives a great performance, bursting with the tangible emotion necessary for her part. However, I must first tip my cap to Claude Rains, who plays Captain Louis Renault. He is one of great character actors, and never have I seen him more in character.But the true star of Casablanca is the Oscar-winning screenplay, the brainchild of playwrights Julius and Philip Epstein. The screenplay has brought its lines to the lips and minds of even those unfortunate enough to have never seen the film. Lines like `Here's looking at you kid' and `Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship'.Lastly, there's that song, As Time Goes By. It's never completely played, in fact its almost just squeezed into the film. It's an ordinary song, but it's the song of Rick and Ilsa (Bogart and Bergman) and that makes it incredible; so much that my heart fills with remembrance of this beautiful film whenever I see it.If you haven't seen it; see it. 10/10 Stars",10,1,1,24 October 2000
Citizen Kane," Simply the best
","I have never found anything wrong with Citizen Kane, nor have I tried hard to do so. A sour note of dialogue badly read, or an auteur quirk taken too far; both are so ostentatious in a film that they cannot be overlooked. So instead I compare Citizen Kane to itself -- a privilege I hold for very few films. Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten give excellent performances, but the character that I cannot resist is Everett Sloane's Bernstein. Bernstein is so consistent as a character I forget he isn't real. He is the source of humble wisdom as the manager of the New York Inquirer -- it is he who first suggests the most correct interpretation of 'Rosebud'.Then there is the camera work, the innovations that appear only in this one-film wonder. It doesn't take a trained eye to hold in awe the beginning of the film. Fades, montage, and actions reflected in a glass ball.
Incredible stuff!",10,0,1,2 October 2000
The Birth of a Nation," Flawed, dated, yet noteworthy
","After having seen this film it is hard not to be disgusted by the heroic interpretation of the KKK conveyed by this movie. Yet, I see the basics elements of Birth of a Nation as the epitome of a movie. Birth of a Nation is about war tearing two families apart. It is about honorable defeat and the chance for an absolute union; a chance destroyed by an assassination. Finally, it is about the quest for revenge. Birth of a Nation is not only the first feature film, but a movie worthy of the utmost respect of movie fans. My recommendation: Stop the tape after Lincoln is assassinated.",8,5,11,8 April 2000
Insomnia," Long, yet interesting (contains vague, possible spoilers)
","If I seem a tad nit-picky, it's because I was immediately drawn into this stylish thriller; director Christopher Nolan's follow-up to 'Memento'. Within a half-hour, I had 'Insomnia' pegged as an ethereal tale of guilt and vengeance set in 'the land of the midnight sun' (I'd already begun to write my review). With three Oscar-winning performers carrying the story forward, I figured that I was in for a treat. I was wrong. Al Pacino was at his best. With all the intensity he had in 'Heat' coupled with the passive, haunted aura his Michael Corleone. The film survived by his grace only. When we drifted from the psychological portrait of Pacino's character that had been building up for the entire film to the conventional get-the-bad-guy mode, the film becomes 'Hawaii 5-O' Alaskan-style. The mind-toying feeling of 'Memento' tried to squeeze into 'Insomnia' via exceptional editing and inventive camerawork with an inspired setting, but it doesn't stick around. Around the 1 1/2 hour mark, the plot gets ludicrous, the lines get screwy, and, in general, the film goes downhill. By the time the end came, I felt how the sleep-deprived Pacino looked: weary and waiting for the end. One climax fell after another and I lost interest. The suspense was still there, but the thrill was gone, and by the time the credits rolled I was disappointed by the poor excuse for an ending. As for the two other stars, Hilary Swank and Robin Williams, they never quite fit in. Swank seemed like the woman showing she can do everything the boys can (her character is compared to Nancy Drew) and it serves only to have her be the stereotypical damsel-in-distress. Williams is good, completely cast against type, but good. 7/10 Stars.Quick recommendation: see 'Manhunter', it's not as stylish, but it's definitely better.",7,1,1,31 May 2002
Taxi Driver," Unique.
","I have seen few films with such diverse reviews as Scorsese's `Taxi Driver'. Roger Ebert has sighted it as one of his `Great Movies', yet Leonard Maltin gave it only two stars. There is a definite schism between the two critics, but I am personally also dubious in commenting on `Taxi Driver'.The film is a complex portrait of a man's descent into violence. Travis, played by Robert De Niro, is continually exposed to the horrors of the city as a New York City cab driver. Already seriously disturbed by the war, Travis is the product of several experiences that seriously impair his view of reality. He becomes hopelessly infatuated with an angelic woman he finds in this panorama of horrors, only to be denied by her because he takes her to a dirty movie. He watches such films all the time, but because his perceptions are so skewed, he doesn't understand what is wrong with them. Later he gives a ride to an erratic man who is determined to kill his cheating wife. The man proudly tells Travis that he is going to blow his wife to pieces with a .45 Magnum. Later, when encouraged to buy a gun for protection, Travis requests a .45 Magnum, and buys every gun available to him. He becomes a soldier, ready to face the evil of New York. He works-out diligently, devises methods to draw his guns, and all the time growing farther away from reality. Armed to the teeth, he comes to the aid of a child prostitute. In the end, he lashes out at his demons with violent results.I have heard rumors that the films premise is based on the film/novel `The Searchers'. Both films center on disturbed veterans that want to save a woman that really doesn't want to be saved. He is simply trying to save the girl from what he hates above all else. `Taxi Driver' doesn't have a distinct plot, it's simply a character sketch of a disturbed individual; an exceptional sketch. I personally don't see a point to the film, but there's a subtle one and somehow it gets across to viewer.`Taxi Driver' strikes me a potential disaster. The film is perplexing at times with a difficult protagonist. The script is heavy-handed and too complex to be correctly interpreted. Here's the good news: the film doesn't attempt to explain confusing points, the film just moves forward. De Niro is a godsend to the film, his exceptional acting makes his character understandable but still appropriately detached from the viewer. Martin Scorsese is exacting in his direction with the additions of excellent camera work and film editing. The violence of the film is superfluous but compelling if the viewer can take it. `Taxi Driver' is not for everyone, but is worth a viewing. 8/10 stars.",8,0,1,24 October 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Pathetic
","Who would have thought that Star Wars, one of the most thrilling, dynamic series ever created, would become formulaic; well, it's happened. Around twenty years ago, Star Wars was a series with something for everyone: drama, action, romance; with themes encompassing love, friendship, and family. Now George Lucas is milking that reputation by revamping the original scripts. Not to spoil anything, but the film moves at the same pace as 'The Empire Strikes Back' and has a disgustingly similar conclusion. This occurred with Episode I as well, but in addition the rewritten plot, Episode II features a weak script and poor acting. The obvious hole is generated by the absence of Liam Neeson, whose performance was exemplary in Episode I and whose acting skill seemed to inspire good performances from young stars Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman. Now Neeson-less, McGregor and Portman seem rather dry. Portman, whose career has interested me since 'Heat', turns in her first big lemon. With respect to Portman, I blame this partially on her co-star Hayden Christensen, whose pseudo-sensitive/romantic approach to the role of Anakin Skywalker, comes off as a non-descript monotone with a complete lack of emotion and he seems to drain feeling from every scene. Luckily, the floundering leads have help. Christopher Lee, Samuel L. Jackson, and Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz) steal every scene they're in, while the rest of the characters stagger around with poor lines and bad acting until the climactic battle. Whereas `The Empire Strikes Back' was thematically (though not ultimately) the best of the original trilogy, `Attack of the Clones' can hope nothing more than to span the gap between Episode I and III, and let us hope that this will be the low point of the series. 3 out of 10 stars.",3,0,0,28 May 2002
Forrest Gump," Not worthy
","I am surprised that `Forrest Gump' made it on the 1997 AFI list of the 100 best American films. My only explanation is that had the virtue of being a recent film. It is memorable, no doubt, but it doesn't fit together.When I first saw the film, I didn't understand the Black Panthers or even the specifics of the Vietnam War. Ultimately I was lost at some places. Now I understand the history, and my stomach turns at the thought of squeezing forty years of history into a two and a half hour film; it didn't work. Digressing, I am shocked by how disgustingly idiotic the character is portrayed, under the guise of a 75 IQ. I'm no expert, but I don't see someone with that IQ dropping his pants or letting himself be hit by rocks. Frankly, the rural areas of the South where young Gump grew up didn't yield rocket scientists. This is because common sense was taught instead of the abstract reasoning of the Weschler IQ scorer. Just because a person cannot recite ten numbers backwards doesn't mean that they will drop their pants on TV.I'm lingering on this because it annoys me due to my elementary knowledge of these facts which were overlooked in the plot of the film. In the 1979 film `Being There', Peter Sellers plays Chance, a gardener with a mind similar to Forrest Gump; even a little simpler. However, his character never left the house where he was born and learned everything from television.Next up on the docket, Vietnam. Vietnam was not funny, nor is its interpretation through the eyes of Private Gump. I don't like heavy-handed Vietnam films like `Platoon' or `Apocalypse Now', and this film is more accurate, visually; so I hear. As for the aftermath, Lieutenant Dan's post-war trauma so closely models that of Jon Voight's character in `Coming Home' that I would sue for copyright infringement.The acting has ups and downs. Gary Senise is excellent as Lieutenant Dan. Robin Wright's dime-a-dozen performance makes me want to throw up. Sally Field is good in her few scenes. Star Tom Hanks is overrated and, frankly, not deserving of that golden statuette. As for the film's Best Picture Oscar, I can only conclude that the judges knew they would be lynched by angry mothers, old people, and arch-conservatives if they selected the ultra-controversial, though much better, film `Pulp Fiction'.`Forrest Gump' has highlights however. The bus stop bench as a forum was a fresh idea. The Bubba-Gump Shrimp section is hilarious. And the too-little-too-late drama at the end of the film sticks with you.Make your own decision, I'm playing it safe with a 5/10.",5,5,9,20 October 2000
American Beauty," Excellent but no where near perfect
","American Beauty ranks as one of the greatest films of the decade and with good reason. It represents a pinnacle of black comedy. Not only has Oscar-winner Spacey been given hilarious lines along with quirky situations, but the film also holds an accurate grasp of human nature and society. It is this that separates American Beauty from similar films like Happiness. The film also contains the best and most vivid motif/symbol I have seen in the color red. Thanks to the crew, the color found its way to the front door and to the clothing along with blood and roses. And the film of the plastic bag is poetry, enforced with an marvelous performance by Wes Bentley.However, I cringe at the film because of the ultimately irresponsible script by Alan Ball. Ball overstepped himself in trying to force profound meaning into his work. He takes the 'world of beauty' concept way too far. The speech that supports this concept is read twice, making the second time superfluous. Worst of all is Spacey's final nostalgic speech. He begins by saying that his last second of his life is infinite; which sounds like bar room philosophy in the untried hands of its writer. Then Spacey begins talking about how his grandmother's skin felt like paper -- absolutely inexcusable! That line has no place in any black comedy, Ball is playing with fire. I've seen American Beauty several times and the ending grows more saccharine each time.Still, this movie is worth watching for it is filled with excellent material. I just hope you're not as critical as I am.",8,0,0,7 August 2000
The Untouchables," Good but overrated
","`The Untouchables' is a solid movie, containing great performances from Sean Connery, Kevin Costner, and Robert De Niro, with more than adequate performances all-around. This film contains a well-known, excellent premise, successfully played-off the classic TV series. I raise my glass to David Mamet for an excellent screenplay that encourages these strong performances.I have one complaint, and it is massive. Between second-rate director Brian De Palma and above average screenwriter David Mamet, the film is given moments too intense to be remotely realistic. The oft-praised `Odessa Steps' shoot-out scene is ludicrous in content, and the bridge shoot-out isn't much better. Having just praised Mamet, I pin these scenes on Brian De Palma, the most over-rated director in the history of film. His heavy-handed style unable to recognize moments requiring drama and subtlety.Appreciate an excellent and appropriate score by Ennio Morricone.Enjoy the film but mourn its mistakes. 7/10",7,5,13,29 October 2000
