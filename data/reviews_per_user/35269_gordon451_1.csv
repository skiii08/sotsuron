Walk the Line," Unfortunately, you gotta go see it.
","OK, on the bright side, Phoenix and Witherspoon shine, glimmer, sparkle and glow radiantly.It's just a shame about the script.The very last credit has the words '...certain events have been fictionalised for dramatic reasons...' Why? Cash's life contained more drama than most screen-writers can ever dream about. I found myself comparing it with 'La Bamba', about Richie Valens' tragically short career -- in my book a much better film, and one that Mangold and Dennis should have watched.This film needed 3 hours rather than only two, and should have covered ALL of Cash's life rather than ending abruptly with his marriage to June Carter. It would have been vastly improved if more attention had been given to Cash's demons instead of his addictions: his jaw injury (take your pick -- cyst removal in the Air Force or broken and incompetently reset after a car crash) and a more sensitive treatment of Jack's death. I looked in vain for his social conscience: where was the Ballad of Ira Hayes?I left the cinema feeling like I'd ordered ice cream but received cream with ice blocks in it. This film is like the tourist attractions we all fall for: you have to go see them 'cos they're so iconic, but you wonder what the fuss is about. Unfortunately, you gotta go see this one.",4,3,9,3 February 2006
