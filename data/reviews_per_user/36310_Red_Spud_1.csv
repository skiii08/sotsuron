The Rock," One of the finest action movies of the nineties!
","Forget what you read in other reviews. If you like action, suspense and some great stunts and camera work go rent/buy The Rock now! I think the opening sequence alone (where we see the cemetery and Ed Harris putting his uniform on) is amazing alone and the opening 'battle' is one of the best made in any film. The whole thing about the film is great; the music, the camera work, the stunts, the explosions.of course, no film is excellent and The Rock's story is a little bit dodgy (one thing i hate is the people who do 'funny lines', i.e. the black woman with the dodgy hair in the cells at the start and the barber in the lift when mason escapes).But they don't bring the movie down and i think that Connery and Cage have a large amount of chemistry between them.Not as good as Bad Boys or Armaggeden (Michael Bay's two other movies) but it's still an amazing movie!10/10 - TOP MARKS - LONG LIVE MICHAEL BAY!",10,1,1,18 March 2001
