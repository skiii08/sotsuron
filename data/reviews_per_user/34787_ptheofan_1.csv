Requiem for a Dream," A must see no-matter what!
","This movie is amazing! Not because of its amazing script (can't tell hence i haven't read the book its based on), but because of the director who manages with every aspect to let you feel how a drugs addict feels. You will feel the agony, the ecstasy, the void, the rush. Everything's there! Scenes: The scenery is 'alive', and give a great medieval ages feeling. It is mood and dark, and still so everyday's images from down-town. Music: Stunning! Amazing! I don't think i can comment any further in it at the present 'cause i've fallen in love with it :) Actors: The all perform well, besides Ellen Burstyn who's exceptional i think! Script/Novel: Haven't read the novel, but the script is quite creepy!A must see movie",10,2,4,28 March 2006
