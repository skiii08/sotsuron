Angels & Demons," Fun, but short of the chilling thrills and suspense from Dan Brown's book
","Whoa, it's the return of Tom Hanks' Harvard University religious symbologist to the big screen, a little older perhaps, but... hey, wait a minute, isn't this film supposed to be a prequel to the $750 million box-office-'Da Vinci Code' ? Still, Tom Hanks, as Professor Robert Langdon, is not failing to bring his audience on a roller coaster ride, less thrilling and less chilling than I had expected, having read the book. Sure, it hasn't miss out the church intrigue, evil and mysterious cults, murders, violence and the greed for power to wet the audience's appetite. Events flow rapidly as Professor Langdon pieces together the abundance of puzzles to bring some tension and some suspense... all for good fun for the screening crowd and keeping the readers of Dan Brown's novel rather miffed with the unsuspecting changes from novel's contents. Refreshingly new in some way, perhaps, but the events do lose their energized, tantalizing, and mystifying appeals as Professor Langdon search his brains for clues and answers.The film's opening is remarkably crafted to open up the story's theme - science vs religion. Hey, the juxtaposition of science and church, after all, is really nothing new! And when Professor Langdon lays his eyes on the Illuminati ambigram, shown by a Vatican visitor, he is ready for Rome. Yep, a dead Pope... and the four Preferiti candidates in Rome are missing. But, will the Professor be able to find the Path of the Illumination? Yep, be ready for your imagination to be stimulated. Oh yes, be prepared to unravel the mind-blowing conspiracies involving the 'Four Alters of Science' - Earth, Air, Fire and Water, and expect to be rocked out of your senses to learn about the many unexplained and mystifying 'Illuminati' symbols, vital to Professor Langdon in his quest to find the missing cardinals. Yep, a killer, from the mysterious ancient Illuminati secret brotherhood, is in Rome, on a vengeful quest against the Vatican's denial of science! And a highly powerful weapon of destruction, called the antimatter, is ticking close to midnight for the Vatican City's Armageddon fate. Can the symbologist save the Preferiti in time before the votes of the conclave are accounted? Can he save the Vatican City? The names of John Milton, Copernicus, and Raphael, are not spared in the Professor's race for clues. And expect to have fun, exploring some of Gian Lorenzo Bernini's celebrated creations... except everything is being rendered so visually fast to hinder the growth of one's fascination with Langdon's logic applications. I was expecting the version from Ron Howard, David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman to provoke and heighten my awe, disbelief, and admiration, as I follow Langdon's adventure. It failed!. Sure, there's nothing wrong for scriptwriters to take liberty with changes to their original sources. However, it can be rather discerning for the Dan Brown book fans to find their most memorable book moments are lost in the adaptation. No doubt, there are some new surprises to the story, but these fail to wet my emotional appetite to intensity. And the changes have reduced my shock and awe reactions. Unlike the book, it fails to lure me into wanting to revisit Rome. While Dan Brown's Rome reeks with compelling mystery and excitement, Director Howard's Rome is mostly dark, creepy, and unrelenting.While the plot and subplots do capture some of Dan Brown's amazing twists and turns, rattling my brain's nerve tissues, it was Langdon's race against time that actually chills. Poor Langdon, he just can't avoid encountering deadly barriers! Oops, the story is not without the book's unconventional female protagonist, joining the Professor on his wild, 'wild-goose' chase to smoke out the villain's moves. Ayelet Zurer's antimatter scientist, Vittoria Vetra , may be watchable, but her Vittoria lacks excitement and curiosity, and, without the fascinating spirit, curiosity and energy of the book's character. Zurer's Vetra seems rather cold, prim, uninteresting, and her presence pretty irrelevant... not what I have expected Vittoria to be from the book's description - 'lithe and graceful, unmistakably Italian - not overly beautiful, but... exude a raw sensuality.' Besides, there's not one once of chemistry between Zurer's character and Tom Hank's in the film.My favorite character is Ewan McGregor's Carmerlengo. He whisks in and out of sight without much ado, and yet, his presence is so astoundingly compelling. McGregor succeeds in bringing the unpredictable and charming Carmelengo directly from the book to the screen, with such absolute and immense exactness of characteristics of the novel's Carmelengo! My kudos to him! Stellan Skarsgard as Commander Richter does not disappoint. And Nikolai Lie Kaas's Assassin? He looks rather lame and passive, not the Dan Brown's mysterious, evil, and creepy Hassassin I was looking for. Of course, it's nice to see a film with a cast of international actors.... if only some of their characters don't look so awkward in their interactions. And while I miss the humor Dan Brown injected into his media characters, I am glad that this film is not missing out on how media folks can be so easily duped! I do miss the book's Agatha Christie-like style with which Dan Brown confuses and challenges one with inter-weaving and easy-to-miss clues and hints to keep one's brain cells moving helter-skelter before the final riddle is solved. Also, Ron Howard's film has not achieved in drawing me directly into the events as if I was there on the scenes. That said, I still wouldn't miss seeing Ron Howard's attempt to turn the book's 572-pages to life on screen in 138 minutes! The film may be scanty in its offering of memorable thrills and chilling suspense, it does, no doubt, give a very impressive visual observation of the lavishly and stylistically captured landlocked sovereign city-state with all the pomp and colorful ceremony, and... its enviable collection of some of the most famous and magnificent paintings, sculptures and architecture in the world.",7,6,12,14 May 2009
Stop-Loss," Survival as a Band of Brothers
","Bold, heart-wrenching and very dramatic, this film lashes out on the topic of Iraq war syndrome that many would rather avoid discussing, lest put it on screen. However, Director Kimberly Peirce, who has a brother serving in Iraq, opted to bring her insider-story to expose the human side of those young men, returning home from the war. Oh yes, young men who have now come home, but are still being tested beyond their ability to withstand the drain and strain; each and every one of them continues to be heavily challenged in his search for self identity in regard to the importance of family bond, the loyalty of friendship, the limits of love, and the value of honor.The story first introduces the audience to a group of young men, operating in the dangerous streets of Iraq. Indeed, a band of brothers who has bonded over time, and who has fought side-by-side and keeping themselves alive by being there for one another. Their loyalty bond is unblemished. We then see the survivors finally returning to their little Texas hometown, welcomed with a Main Street parade and joyous celebrations to crown them as American heroes. But, with the glorious razzmatazz of tributes and show extravaganzas ending, who really cares about these young war veterans? Writer/Director does and her very touching film allows the audience to follow the lives of a few young men, seemingly wounded, either physically or mentally, as they adjust to civilian life. Ryan Phillippe's Brandon has completed two tours; Channing Tatum's Steve has already served one and plans to marry his hometown gal, Michelle. Then, there's Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Tommy, and many, many others all of them, seemingly no different from their community of young men who had not been to war at least until we observe them closely. So many of them have a lot of healing to do, and like their days spent in Iraq, these young veterans depend on one another's protection, and with one leader keeping them in order. Yes, Brandon is always there for them; always taking charge and never letting them down. Observe the effects war has had on these young men. Study how their families try to reach out to them. And as the story unfolds, the audience, just like these young soldiers, will come to realize that the government's policy has its way of enslaving young soldiers to eternal service. What if Brandon has to be deployed back to Iraq? How would stop-loss affect his life and the lives of those traumatized and hurting veterans he protects? The stories of these young men are very compelling to follow and their feelings are tragic and intense as we examine the camaraderie these young soldiers share. It's about survival as a group; it's about their need and determination to protect each other. And it's about a soldier who feels betrayed by his government. With appropriately edited in flashbacks of horrendous war scenes, the film creates an insight of the causes and effects to the soldiers' traumatic stress disorders. We study their fear, their courage and bravery, their traumatic sufferings, their pride and their hardship. This film also defines the meaning of the film's title, letting the audience see how stop-loss has its rippling bad effects on even the finest soldier. And what we capture from the story is that stop-loss does abuse the faith of soldiers. Brandon is being stop-lossed, Should he AWOL to Canada or Mexico, or should he willingly and dutifully return to Iraq? Young men volunteer to fight a war for different reasons, but ultimately, it's their being inseparable members of their unit, or band of brothers, that would ultimately leave them to decide how they'd deal with the war. Oh yes, it's not hard to see that stop-loss is no different from back-door draft. Does it appeal to those with little else to lose in life, or as a trade-off for criminal pardon, or as a death-sentencing certificate for a already injured illegal alien serving with the US Troops and whose death allows his family members to gain access to 'green cards? Great cinematic realism, phenomenal performances by the cast ensemble, a story well-crafted with solid psychological analysis and depth, and an absolutely powerful, emotional, and heart-wrenching film to watch! It's a film that cries out in 'Support of Our Troops'.",9,8,18,25 March 2008
Minority Report," A superb Whodunit flick that pays homage to Stanley Kubrik...
","This movie scares the heck out of me to think that there could be a futuristic judicial system that detects murderers before the crimes are committed!  Would I really trust psychic technology that could backfire against its assumed purpose?  Yep, watching this film does keep my mind ticking with questions, from beginning to the end. It even makes me wonder how the clairvoyant trio, in this movie, is not interested in criminals, such as robbers, rapists, and corporate cheater.  Yep, this is a wonderful, mind-boggling film that sucks me into interaction with characters and events -- keeping me attentive, contemplative, and edgy!  Oh yes, it's a whodunit' tale in noir style! And it's done with such superb beauty and flair almost as if Spielberg is once again paying homage to Stanley Kubrik's style of filmmaking -- crafting scenes that the viewer finds unsettling (example: Clockwork Orange & Eyes Wide Shut).  The blue cinematic effects are truly surreal stirring up memories of scenes in A.I. too. The scenes with the Precog trio floating in a tank of water and with Anderton submerged in a water-filled bathtub seem rather austere, yet amazingly beautiful!Two thumbs up for the wonderful performances of the total cast it's their combined performances that truly keep the story rolling. Tom Cruise's performance is solid and outstanding. I find myself literally flung into his John Anderton's shoes, plunging myself into one hell of an adventure, in my attempt to stay focused on theories of conspiracy, power and corruption to solve the `crime.'  I have had a fun time trying to figure out the Precrime System and at playing detective! Yep, this is a movie that will suck the viewers into one event after another, providing them little opportunity to tear away from Anderton's doom.Two Precogs in agreement to create a potentially trustworthy result and considered a majority report to warrant an arrest, while a dissenting view of the third, the minority report, is filed away as unreliable?  Surely the so-called basic tenants of the rule of law are indeed confusing to follow. I keep reminding myself that this absurd ruling doesn't help me shed light on the mystery.  However, the story is done with such awesome flow and pace and succeeds in allowing the viewers to collect their clues in a very intense and exciting fashion. I feel as if I'm trapped in the schizophrenic atmosphere, searching for breathing space while everything and everyone seem to plunge me into constant doubts, hope and disbelief.   Yep, this movie definitely thrills!  It's Spielberg's futuristic world, where Washington DC's famous old-styled monuments still exist, but where the System denies us our privacy, and where creepy, crawly electronic spiders can easily track down our presence.  Phenomenal, but hardly pleasant imagination that's being projected on the screen!There's a very dark tone underlying the whole film. Even John Williams' music score is downright haunting. Despite the non-stop action, excitement and suspense, the characters will sink the viewers into waves of creepy, hopeless and helpless feelings throughout the plot and sub-plots.  Gosh, this film takes me on a long ride - thrilling and rough. It has been easy for me to figure out the good from the bad dudes. Nope, there's no telling when the puzzles are going to fit together nicely. Yep, I'm drained out of my total energy watching this movie even as I try to keep up with the flash-forward scenes of the Precogs' minds!  And I welcome the moments that bring out my unintentional giggles as if I find them most necessary to take me away from my overlapping and disturbing mental state and intensity.This movie is truly terrific and does also absorb a distinctive matrix-type feel.  The psychic chase, the high-tech futuristic-looking gizmos, the process of identity-scanning eyes, and even the old homeless man stooping to pick up the scattered coins are incredible to see.  And being able to spot Cameron Crowe (reading a copy of the USA Today newspaper) and Cameron Diaz in their cameo roles is rather cool.  Hey, can I be imagining that Peter Storemare's doc' character does speak in a strange dialect?  Oh yes, this movie has a lot to offer to the movie buffs. I even enjoy being shoved against the wall in helpless tension, as I thrust all my effort in trying to make sense out of Anderton's misfortune.This film definitely has all the rich filmmaking ingredients that will give it a deserving A+ rating. I will definitely see it again!",Null,0,0,17 June 2002
Underworld," The answer to our fight against prejudices and wars, perhaps!
","It's a dark and complex story. It's cool and hip for today's younger generation. It's sending a message that wars will continue to trigger if old habits of prejudices are not replaced by the meshing of moderate ideals. Can racism or the prejudicial cast system be wiped with crossbreeding? Can wars between the rich and poor be ever solved? Oh yes, the Vampires could easily exemplify corporate snobs fighting the Werewolf Lycans (street thuds?) to conquer the Hungarian' underworld (interestingly giving the feel of a WWW II subterranean bunker). Wow, aren't we all different sects of monsters when it comes to making war?  I find this film very interesting.
The film starts off well with a fabulously exciting train station scene - a good premise as we see the two rival species in action. The rest comes off as filmmaking tributes to Matrix Reloaded, The Crow and F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu or signs of recognizable vampire' flicks. There are even momentary moments of the `Romeo and Juliet' appeal. At times, the scenes carry the comic book flavor. Everything comes appropriately together without interrupting the flow of the easy-to-digest plot and sub-plots. This film's drenched with CGI visual effects and non-stop action sequences, creating spectacular eye-popping extravaganza. Beautiful choreography in the fight scenes too. Are the characters well developed? Oh yes, they are basically simple characters without too much complexity to make the themes work.
This film s really fun to watch. I really like the way the vampires and werewolves are presented  so segregated in their ideals, style, methods of defense, and actions as they enter one scene after another that's filled with the explosive blue tinge of special effects.  Of course, it's always lovely to see a shapely, butt-kicking female vampire in tight-fitting outfit or her fluttering cape. Oh yes, the idea that vampires can be toasted by ultraviolet ammunition is also a pretty cool concept. Even if the plot and subplots may be lost in translation' for some, the good twists and furls are there to capture one's attention. Kate Beckinsale's Selene is almost a composite of Matrix's Trinity and Blade II's Nyssa. At long last, we aren't getting any cheesy and voluptuous temptress to make the story work. Beckinsale portrays her internal conflicts without a flaw. She's supported by a great cast of actors who succeed in not creating chaotic mess in the movie.  This movie captured my attention throughout. B+",Null,0,1,15 September 2003
Bloody Sunday," It's murder by the demonstration of power!
","Truly a powerfully and vividly profound and horrendous take on that fatal Derry day of massacre and debacle of 1972 that fortified the IRA's stronghold! And it's not unlike a dramatic repertoire of the ancient Greek tragedies that we are so familiar.  27 peaceful Irish demonstrators fatally shot and 13 dead - all because of their willingness to participate in a peace march against Britain's policy of 'internment without trial' and its policy of political favoritism! Random arrests turning into random killing! Everything exposed on screen!  Are the Brits mostly at fault?  Tim Pigott-Smith's obnoxiously condescending Major General Ford's command tactics will certainly bring discussions to our dinner table.Director/Writer Paul Greengrass gives a heinous account of the tragedies from both sides of the aisle. Events flip from the Irish side to the British, and vice versa, offering significant events to prompt the viewers' judgment. His jerky and amazing verite-cinema shots, and his faux-documentary filmmaking style give me the illusion of being an eye-witness to the events, feeling the tensions of both sides; causing me to build up that sense of urgency to stay involved - right on the scenes with the cameraman. The bleached and stark images also provide an effective stir to the moods and despair. Absolutely unpretentious, so intensely real!No fancy character development, only glimpses of some of the characters' backgrounds - yep, ordinary people, in the City of Derry, going about their daily lives before the eventful day. And British soldiers tracking their moves.  The actors, playing their roles, are awesomely fabulous. They are truly convincing.  Just watch the progress of their moods. I was gripped by their personal stories. And I was frankly and totally absorbed by James Nesbitt's Ivan Cooper (the leader of the Irish civil-rights coalition,), watching this factory manager character stroll from his home through streets, and passing the theater where the `Sunday Bloody Sunday' and `Magnificent 7' movies are being shown at their local theater. Observing these characters, watching their plight, their baffling behaviors, and their decisively aggressive acts, and being thrown into the scenes of chaotic hostilities and confusion are like suffering the panic and excruciating pain from a bullet ricocheting through my spine. Yep, an absolutely dramatic and emotionally and chillingly disturbing attempt at revealing a historical episode! Just listen to the names of the dead being read out, between scenes of presenting the British soldiers' blotched defenses and fallacies.The lack of dialogue is also ingeniously done to create a real-life approach to commotion and sense of tension.  Hardly any music accompanies the scenes. Just phones ringing off the hook and baby cries.  Absolutely a praiseworthy development to add realism to events!  Only the U2's `Sunday, Bloody Sunday' song score grates loudly through the closing credits... continuing way past their finale. Very effective!It's the film to watch for those interested to see how well filmmaking can capture an effective point of view. It's a film that astonishingly  takes one right to that fatal Sunday of January 30 that has since led to the continuing estranged relationship between Northern Ireland and Britain. I am frankly still shaken and numb - even at this point of posting.
My rating: A-",Null,5,16,23 October 2002
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," It's a study about the animal savagery instincts vs the gentile human qualities!
","Who exactly is Wolverine? Oh yes, I was hoping to see a solid story in which Director Gavin Hood leaves no stones unturned to bring out a stunning, astoundingly memorable character growth and character expansion of Hugh Jackman's iconic Wolverine, not seen on screen before. I wasn't disappointed. Even the events and twist involving Silver Fox are nicely rolled into the tale to support Logan/Wolverine's motivations. Do I care that Silver Fox is seen to have a tactile mind control ability rather than accelerated healing factor? Not really as the creative change works beautifully for this film. Her presence in this film is a vital part of the inner struggle between the Logan/Wolverine's animal savagery instincts and the Logan/Wolverine's noble human qualities. We do get a little bit more of Wolverine's past, a past that flows back to 1845, building on a brief, but satisfying introduction to the relationship and sibling rivalry between him (James Howlett) and his troublesome half brother, Victor, and then onwards to their involvement in various war- whew, I sure did have a jolly good time identifying the four historical American wars! But as events move to Logan's mercenary involvement in the Weapon X project and with General Stryker, the scenes start to get more and more thrilling as the raging Wolverine faces deceit, betrayal, revenge, empowerment...and the loss of memory. Okay, there's relatively nothing ultra new about Jackman's Wolverine that X-Men comic book fans don't know, but, boy, oh boy, never have I seen Hugh Jackman going so super-energized and so fabulously athletic in a film... and so constantly highlighting his shirtless, well-preserved, sexy physique! And I'm especially pleased that his Wolverine has more character depth in this film. It's definitely compelling to watch his changing behaviors at each stage of his metamorphosis. Whoa, watch him growl and howl in rage...yep, a dark character, but never losing his charismatic charm! The most striking moments for me are when the opposing traits and sentiments come into conflicting play between the two brothers. Oh yes, Liev Schreiber is picture perfect and very credible as Sabretooth! Whoa, Jackman and Schreiber are indeed a dynamic duo in this film! Danny Huston, too, succeeds in bringing out the devious and villainous William Stryker. And as befitting its title, this film does not fail to deliver the many familiar X-men mutants in this film...hhhmmh, Deadpool, Gambit, Wraith, Cyclops, Mystique, Storm, Ice Man having made the list. Hey, surely no X-Men film can be complete without at least a cameo appearance of the most celebrated promoter of the peaceful affirmation of mutant rights? Although there are some rather interesting lines of dialogue, expressing clear political as well as social observation, the dialogue, overall, is rather clunky. And while some of the fight scenes are very impressive, they tend to loose their appeal with the over-repetitive takes. Some also feel too far-fetched. The chase and the slow-mo explosion scenes? These may be considered as clichéd, over-used, and almost obligatory, but I'm not displeased with those seen here. The cutting-edge special effects and stunt razzmatazz are outrageously spectacular, working well with the story's elements and to offer non-stop actions for inciting the audience's visceral reactions. Besides, it'd be foolhardy to think that we all aren't thrilled to see villains being blown to smithereens in films! Overall, I was happily entertained. And I did stay to see the post-credit 'bar' scene, too.",8,4,8,1 May 2009
The Others," Hush, hush... just listen to the Living Dead!
","I see dead people? Yes, I did; No, I didn't!  Indeed, this movie is incredibly spooky.  Two thumbs up for Alejandro Amenabar.  He has crafted a great script to direct on screen.  This is a great thriller that combines intelligence with fear in an incredible cinematic style.  Everything about this movie has a haunting, yet elegant, quality.  No cheap shocker, insulting joke, or crudity to make this thriller a success. Neither a male doppelganger nor a chick flick!  Simply a schematic flick filled with eeriness! And I love it. And it's confronting the very dark side of human nature in the midst of frustration and insecurities. The cast of talented actors allows each of their roles to intertwine perfectly with each other to build up the suspense and creeps.  Refreshing! In a sense, this is `The Haunting' cradled with the Hitchcockian terror and apparitions and it has the usual cool, icy blonde! No kidding! Nicole Kidman has performed well to sustain the viewer's mind consistently on a wild goose chase!  She wrangles up beauty, charm and spirit and angst. But her hoity-toity and condescending Grace character sends chill right down my spine. Fionnula Flanagan's performance is equally phenomenal. Troubled relationships, anger, mistrust, deceit, spirituality and mood-swings to add to the intense drama within the confinement of an isolated and austere mansion!  It's simply impossible to allow any of the characters to slip out of one's sight. Watch them carefully and they become very part of your being! Even the Vals Opus background score supports a sense of mystery and hidden violence.",Null,0,0,12 August 2001
Terminator Salvation," The values of humanity and humility that John Connor need to learn...
","Wow, an installment of the celebrated franchise, without Arnie (oops, unless, he deserves to be credited for the virtual prototype of the T-800 killer machine cameo with the familiar face)! As this film thrusts before us lots and lots of new faces, knocking off Arnie, how will the Terminator fans react to this new installment? Truthfully, I haven't missed him! Hey, there are more advanced and deadlier Terminators in this film on the kill to put us on edge. Even, the motorcycle machine killer is refreshingly imaginative! Besides, this film is not robbing the audience of the series' central theme - humanity.This fourth installment is just as entertaining and fun â€“ darker for certain, and with a better focus on character development. Christian Bale does a good job as Connor, delivering enormous stamina and credibility to his immature character. Here, we see Connor, not quite close to the predicted 2029 prophesy, but drawing a step closer to fulfilling his destiny as the leader of the human resistance. In his twenties, he now steps into Bale's shoes to offer his new look, his physical skills, and his flawed mental judgment as the Skynet robots become more intelligent, almost non-destructible, and deadlier. The story begins with our introduction to Sam Worthington's Marcus Wright, a death-row inmate, who, under the persuasion and deceit of Helen Bonham Carter's Serena, donated his body to Cyberdyne Corporation. The year is 2003. We are then plunged to the post-apocalyptic 2018 We encounter Connor jumping into a helicopter for a strike at a SkyNet facility while human beings are being hounded and killed by the deadly machines in the human beings' determination to destroy the facility. Even from the moment we see him, it's obvious that we'd be facing a complicating and complex character that is, nonetheless, aware of his destined purpose. Observe how effective Conner is in inspiring the humans. In the midst of the calamity and explosions, the scenes shift to Marcus Wright. Awakes, dazed and hazy initially,he soon snaps out of his blurry state. As he bumps into a Resistance soldier, Anton Yelchin's Kyle Reese and young Star, it would be difficult for the viewers to refrain from smiling. Yep, it's the Kyle Reese in the first Terminator film, the protector and savior of Sarah Connor, and the father of her child! Director McG has smartly created introductions of the three principle characters whose lives must insect to generate the relevant themes for this installment. In a subtle way, it does pay tribute to the first film. Besides, there's much to examine about the unpredictable directions the characters are taking us. Even the state-of-the-art special effects are well crafted to instill fear, hopelessness and uncertainties, associated with devastation, mess, and despair, scene after scene. In a way, they serve as metaphors to Connor's personality and feelings... a rapture of havoc. Yep, the special effects do also provide the feeling and smell of metal and death... cold, as cold as the way Connor treats Wright! Can righteous cause be justified without considering its ultimate effects on mankind? While following the story, I have been struck by the realization of the vital and important relevance of Wright's story in this film. Frankly, it has dawned on me Wright's story does target the interesting theme of 'second chance.' Also, his psyche, and his decision-making choices settle onto another great theme - the important value of humane wisdom of heartfelt decision-making. What can Connor learn from Wright? And how important is that? Director McG has succeeded wonderfully for not only giving us another too familiar and bombastic 'terminator action film, but a story that allows the viewers to search, analyze and understand the different forms of leadership decision-making in human beings. We can see that Connor has a lot to learn before he can really succeed in moving from second-in-command to his ultimate and destined leadership. Even the brief take of the photo of Linda Hamilton's Susan Connor is a reminder that she has developed into a stronger and wiser character when she arrived at the South of the Border.This film has surged up my excitement for the next installment to the celebrated series. I love this film! It does make me put on my thinking cap to examine the story much deeper than what flows visually before my eyes!",10,58,106,18 May 2009
We Were Soldiers," Compelling, mind-blowing, and incredibly realistic...
","MINOR SPOILERS...As with Black Hawk Down, We Were Soldiers is an exceptional epic that will drag the viewers painfully through the tortures of a hellish and gut-wrenching four-day warfare. Totally gruesome; uncannily barbaric! This movie is filled with unimaginable and horrifically shattering moments that will be difficult to wipe out from one's memory! It's an eye-witnessing experience to a historical dilemma. And the experience is graphically powerful and oft times, humiliating!The technical aspects are so immensely realistic achieving their commitment to reveal the terror in the `Valley of the Shadow of Death.' The scenes with Joe Galloway taking photo-shots are mesmerizing! And I was completely dazed with that one scene of the looming fire during one of the bomb explosions! Barry Pepper is awesome in his role! This film also has amazing music scores and lyrics! They definitely enhance the spirit and moods of the scenes portrayed, drumming up tension, fear and desperation. Absolutely poignant and stirring!My heart aches for the group of freshly trained, young soldiers of the 1st, Battalion, 7th Calvary! A group who has to leave their families in the middle of the night, dropped by helicopter, and stranded in Nam's Drang Valley, only to come face to face with their unexpected brutal destinies. Can they stay alive, fighting off countless and countless of enemies and against overwhelming odds? Observe how these men struggle to evade flesh and bone shattering bullets and burning napalm! Watch how every man try to stay alive! Compelling totally mind-blowing! A story that presents an enthralling insight to the desperate battle fought by men from both sides! This movie certainly is not meant for viewers with weak hearts! But it's the best war film I've seen in years!Mel Gibson's performance as Lt. General Harold Moore is commendable.  His portrayal of the leader of a pack of helpless, young men is visibly admirable on screen. His desperation, his strength, his bitterness, and his devotion to his men, despite the lack of resources, were powerfully shown. And Sam Elliot's eccentric Sgt. Major Plumley is incredibly outstanding. Rough, tough, yet so witty and wise! Here's an actor who is capable of getting his character's integrity, honesty and charm ooze out of the screen. A phenomenally appealing character who does bring a few chuckles, despite the intensity of the environment! The overall cast members are just as solid with their performances. And the female actors certainly contributed significantly to this movie. They allow us to explore the struggles and the tragic circumstances faced by the wives of the men-at-war. They provide a great perspective of families at home, living through hell and agony while their loved ones served their country. Madeleine Stowe's role certainly added emotional intensity to the screen. Sure, the sight of the Western Union telegrams will definitely bring panic, even to the viewers!There's a strong message learned from this film.  Men in combat will always be victims of suffering no matter which side they take.  This movie totally plunges me in into an overwhelmingly combination of psychotic emotions of desperation, concern, terror, scorn, morose and forlorn.  That's how powerful this movie is!  And it gives me ground to ask: Can we ever learn from history that war is an exploitation of human dignity and integrity? Even a nation's victory can never compensate the loss of so many good lives the lives of men who had stood by and died for their fellow comrades!  This movie is an A+ masterpiece production!",Null,0,0,13 February 2002
Blade II," Sure, it's better than its predecessor!
","Have a flaming flair for non-stop action, gore, and those blood-sucking, fang-teethed humans? Then this flick is definitely for you! Just listen to the silence, with the occasional scream during the screening, and the loud applause at the end, and you'd be wondering how people could possibly dislike this movie! Wesley Snipes gosh, I do like this guy, not only because he's never afraid to take on roles for lessening racially romantic barriers! He is charismatic, even while flexing his muscles!Hey, I don't know what to think of our new Blade's wisdom! Our hero, ganging up with those Shadow-of-Nation vampires? Got to be kidding!  I just rented and saw the predecessor! I wonder whether he's now having a problem with his testosterone-overflow, and Nyssa is the cause of his slacking sapience! (Hey, didn't Cleopatra make Caesar a wimp?)And society's new threat? Rippers? Nope, not some hooded descendants of Jack the Ripper, or of old Nosterafu unless our genome-dealing organizations are keeping some dark secret from us! Oh well, who cares as long as this flick projects the `good vs. evil' theme of the comics well on to the big screen. And it does! Who says it's never difficult to distinguish the good guys from the baddies?  Gosh, I love the stunts; I love the fast actions thanks to Hong Kong for whetting our appetites for martial arts! Yep, the actions are mesmerizing! Yep, the takes are as exciting as when Ellen Ripley's deadly encounter with the alien species!Overall, the film's character development is mediocre. But as a quixotic action actor, Snipes is phenomenal! Love his indestructible character! Kris Kristofferson's Whistler is very lame not much credibility! And Scud, gosh, he is rather predictable! Yet, there's a definite sense and purpose for every character's presence! Unfortunately, there're too many subplots dumped into the main plot, thus weakening the character development. And the one-liners appear as scatter-brained material to hold strong for worthwhile memorizing! Hello, Coen Brothers, where are you in the development of the script's dialogue?  But I DO LIKE the cinematic effects and the creative composite of horrific creatures (truthfully, better than what LOTR has provided!)  Whoa, I was jitter-bugging in my seat, and literally playing hide-seek with the screen! Can't say I wasn't enticed with this film! And the hip-hop soundtrack far too loud and sometimes incoherent  definitely prevents the feel of horror and schlock in various scenes!Go see this flick if you're an action-horror film freak! Rest assured, you won't need a partner to put you in a jitter-bugging mood, throughout this flick!  Thumbs up for Guillermo Del Toro (heard he's not e'en a distant cousin to Benicio!) After this flick, and The Devil's Backbone, he sure is my sort of Director one who knows how to thrill and scare me! A solid rating of A- from me and I definitely will encourage my young buddies to keep away from this flick! Not unless, they enjoy having nightmares!",Null,0,1,19 March 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," It's the association of fiction with facts that makes this film so incredible and fulfilling to watch...
","I went to the screening with the advice to think of 'Thomas Anderson' as name derived from the Greek word 'andras' - to mean 'man,' thus Neo could, perhaps, be a personification of 'son of man.' I was even told to see Neo as having been saved/resurrected by a kiss from a character called Trinity in the previous film. This concluding film begins where it left off at 'Matrix Reloaded.' At long last, the task of analyzing the trilogy becomes easier with this stunning conclusion of the trilogy. 'Everything that has a beginning has an end.'  This film does offer the end. It gives sense to what Neo is all about. It reveals his purpose and that through his discovery of his purpose, the audience can start piecing together the symbolic purposes of Morpheus, Trinity, Agent Smith, and the Bane character. It's through their dialogue and actions in this film, the philosophical and theological meanings of trilogy become clear, opening up the reality that the salvation of human beings is only possible as a result of one essential deed of Neo. This film captures a lot of important themes: will power and faith, death, betrayal, the Coming of Christ - themes that make the audience realize the power of faith is greater than the dreamer's will. Even the definition of 'Matrix' comes clear with this film. I thought that the inclusion if the 'holy-child' Sati is clever as her final appearance and dialogue unlocks the important message this film is giving.One has to see this film to believe how extreme, advanced and complex digital technology can be. The film exposes the audience to an incredibly explosive journey through loads of uncannily mind-blowing CGI special effects, artwork and phenomenal groundbreaking actions. Definitely an unforgettable impact for the eyes! This stunning conclusion takes Neo on a journey that includes his search of the Architect (perhaps the aggressive God of the Gnostic gospel), his reunion with the Agents (Herod, as defined in New Testament, to mean the many rulers connected with the early history of Christianity?)  then to what appears to be a train station ('No Man's Land' where trains do depart for Tibet?), his trip to Hel - all in his quest to save the citizens of Zion and the rebels.Just watching the swarms of sinister steely, octopus-like Sentinels rage upon the Zion military and the volunteers, with such astounding forces, is worth the price of a regular tix. The spectacularly dramatic war siege is like nothing I've seen before on screen.  The hypnotic sounds of the music scores compliment the exhilarating experience further.  The characters are very interesting to follow. Hugo Weaving offers some unusual dark humor to his Smith character(s).Matrix plunges the viewers to the `Womb' (Garden of Eden?) of Adam and Eve's original sin. Humans have used knowledge for materialism and bringing artificial intelligence and deceit that's enhanced by the construction of someone else's creation. The 'womb' then becomes the breeding ground for intelligent machines are generating electricity from humans. Matrix Reloaded explores freewill and determinism and speaks of the coming of the prophesized messiah called Thomas Anderson (Greek 'andras' for man, thus 'son of man.') who will be saved by a character called Trinity. It's the resurrected Neo that can defeat the evil agents within the Matrix. Both the first and second films seem to stress on humanity's problem as 'sleeping in ignorance in a dreamworld.' Only by waking up to wisdom and enlightenment can bring solution to that problem. The second of the trilogy reveals that freedom, of choice and dignity can have their implications. This third film harps on the One, who, by reason of his destiny, learns that what appears to be the real world is an illusion he has to manipulate with his will. It also highlights on the concept of human faith vs. the dreamer's will and offers an insight to what it means by destiny, choice, purpose and the will to belief.  It's watching human faith replacing the dreamer's will.
Is it impossible for the humans to rid themselves of their own created problems? What if they don't come to terms with their religious beliefs and faith?  The audience sees a Neo discovering his purpose. He must take control of his unconscious dream world, face reality and recognize his ultimate destiny. He has to make the powerful Agent Smiths subject to his will in order to fulfill his destiny of suffering, dying and ultimately resurrecting.  Is Neo a symbolic Christ who'll save those willing to have faith in him? Seems likely. Could the Matrix actually be a representation of the Garden of Eden where man's original sin sets forth the human suffering? Is Ian Bliss' Bane a symbol of the biblical Judas, perhaps, who'll prevent Neo from showing the way for the rest of humanity?  Is Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus the Peter, or head of the Church, who'll keep reminding the world to hold their faith in the Savior and await his coming? What about Agent Smith? Could he be a personification of the mighty Herod?  Herod, in the New Testament, was the name of many rulers connected with the early history of Christianity. Perhaps, that explains the many Smith clones encountered onscreen.  As for the last few lines from the young Sati. are they intended to remind us of Christ's resurrection?  Is Sati supposed to become the 'Golden Child', chosen as the next Dalai Lama? Even this last of the trilogy doesn't really offer an easy explanation to the Wachowski brothers' intended philosophical and theological meanings.  One viewer's guess is as good as another. and that's why their three films are so amazingly interesting. 'Everything that has a beginning has an end.'  This film does offer the end. I had a terrific time watching and analyzing the characters and actually felt totally 'fulfilled' at its finale. I'D LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF THIS FILM!!! A",Null,0,0,4 November 2003
Lilo & Stitch," Nope, it's not simplicity at its best...
","A sweet film that captures the feeling that anyone has the ability to change for the better through love, sharing, and bonding!  It focuses on themes that are easily associated with everyday life.  Sure, I'm fascinated with the way this film connects the themes to the Hawaiian 'ohana' concept.
Ohana, for any Hawaiian, means a group of people (closely and distantly related) who share nearly everything. Yep, sharing is the core of ohana value. Hawaiians believe that duties to 'ohana' will help them increase their mana (spirituality). The concept of `immediate family' is alien to native Hawaiians. I'm not sure whether the very young viewers will be able to grasp this association, but I'm convinced they would definitely grasp and enjoy watching the development of friendship between the environmental-conscious, little Lilo and the koala-gremlin like, extra-terrestrial Stitch.Two characters who are so different in appearance, yet almost similar in behavior and traits. I've no doubt that it would tickle the young viewers to catch the mischievous behaviors of these characters on screen. Also, there's enough action and plenty of wacky and weird looking characters in this film to hold up their interest and attention. Young lads would most certainly applaud the sci-fi creativity. And there's nothing crude or terrifying to tempt contempt from their parents. This film has a fair amount of humor, but I'm not convinced that kids below the age of 5 would be able to recognize most of it. Overall, the movie is paced well and the length of the story is appropriate - even for the very young kiddies.The artistic style of this movie pumps up memories of the traditional animated cartoon medium of Freddie Moore, Ollie Johnston, Frank Thomas and Eric Larson. But I wouldn't say it's simplicity at its best.  The characters lack the charisma and color of those characters of Monsters, Inc. And the film does fall short of those lovely musical elements that have come to be so appealing with the modern-day Disney animated flicks. After all, the film's setting is Hawaii, and Hawaii is known to be an island of song, beauty and dance!  However, I'm grateful for the familiar Queen Liliuokalani's composition `Aloha O'e.'The voices of Tia Carrera and Jason Scott Lee succeed in giving their characters the Hawaiian credibility. But overall, the voices given to the majority of characters don't appear to energize the characters' personalities.  Only Stitch's character is cool and pretty credible. an alien whose actions definitely speak louder than words. He is the character that truly brings out laughter from the children sitting around me!Obviously, this film pays a great deal of homage to Elvis. Quite appropriate, I must say!  How can fans of Elvis ever forget that The King had serenaded them with those unforgettable songs from his `Blue Hawaii' flick!  Overall, it's a nice summer film to watch with the younger kids. But I doubt it's the sort of Disney movie the kids would be willing to watch over and over again.",Null,2,2,18 June 2002
Cold Mountain," It's the lasting effects of war on the idividuals...
","Anthony Mingheller's astounding film cleverly sweeps the audience into the horrors of war at its beginning.  He then introduces his two principle characters who would gradually move the audience into their world wrought by war and hardship. We watch as the characters begin to unravel their internal tortures and their need to subdue their isolation to face their regrets and hope for the future.  This is an absolutely fabulous movie that portrays the stunning performances of its stellar cast of actors and the overwhelming raw landscapes that are kept in sync with their events and moods.  Observe the stages of emotional changes in the characters. So amazingly and magnificently captured at different camera angles, from scene to scene against the cold, mountainous countryside!This film isn't throwing off longwinded dialogue and lengthy physical encounters between Jude Law's Inman and Nicole Kidman's Ada to reveal the meeting of two souls searching for a meaningful existence.  Yep, it's that brief and silent stare of Inman as he confronts the graciously low-keyed, prim and proper Ada that explicitly puts their sensory awareness of each other so powerfully on screen.  As the events flow, I was completely mesmerized by the Inman character watching him transcend to his sense of isolation and his developing disillusion with his world. On the other hand, I couldn't take my eyes off the immaculately well-bred and gorgeous Ada as she succumbs into a scrawny hapless damsel in complete distress.  It's fascinating to watch the couple adapt to situations beyond their control and to study the emotional and behavioral attitudes of two human beings altering at such opposing magnitude as a result of one war.  Observe how the once popular Inman slips into desolation in the battlefield, becoming even more tormented from his world as he meets up with some very strange characters. Will he ever find solace with these characters, or with Ada at the end? Will Ada, while feeling alienated from her new abode, at the beginning of the film and with the death of her father, be able to battle her insecurity to become spiritually enlightened and physically capable with the help of her new acquaintances?  Is she able to embraces what the farmland has to offer her? And will Inman be capable of escaping what the gruesome battlefield has come to mean to him?  This film lays out an enormous ground for the examination of the effects a war on different individuals.The film continues to remind the audience that Ada and Inman are bound together by their haunting memories of one another.  That, indeed, is beautifully captured by the expressions on Law and Kidman's faces. The symbolisms, throughout the film, are plentiful and brilliantly ascribed, allowing the audience to join the dots to the destinies of the couple. Even crows, clearly suggesting doom and destruction, never fail to demonstrate the dark instincts that trouble a man's soul. And those women Inman meets in his journey seem to trigger the expectation of the audience to see him drawing closer to the woman he loves and to home.  Even these characters, encountered by Inman, provide a picture of how different people react to the war. But will war ultimately bring peace and safety to its protagonists? This film is a masterpiece that will provide much food for thought.Renee Zwellweger is phenomenal in her boisterously loud 'Ruby' role. She brings another aspect of the American woman that's so different in breeding from Kidman's Ada.  Both are educated in their different cultural way of life.  What can Ada learn from Ruby, the frontier woman who sees the 'hands and knees' toiling as the only way of survival in her community? Zwellweger provides the comic relief that's much needed for this powerfully intense film.  She's superb in her role as the beacon of strength and hope for injecting a meaningful existence of living. Unlike the soldiers or the hypocritical Home Guard authorities that use guns to destroy their enemies, Ruby uses her hands-on skills to beat the odds of survival. It's uncannily delightful to watch her interacting with Kidman's character. She, Law and Kidman are definitely worthy of being recipients of the Oscar statuettes. They exhibit their superb non-stop performing talents in this film with their onscreen appearances. The Q&A session with Brendon Gleeson (who plays Ruby's father), has prompted me to want to go see this movie again - to watch closely how the strength of the film's womenfolk can make a difference to the human beings' survival instincts.  I want to study again how hellish wars are for destroying and crippling, not only the physical, but the mental aspects of the masculine race.  And Gleeson does drive home an interesting question: When these mountain folks `volunteer' to fight a war, how come they should be penalized as deserters if they were to decide to opt out of it?This film is a MUST-SEE. It's beautifully crafted, assembled, and absolutely mesmerizing in all aspects of filmmaking techniques and style. The music score and soundtracks are so appropriate locked into the events and the moods of the characters. And the film's title? It does project its allegorical appeal.A+",Null,140,190,11 December 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," So, it's about the Terminator hunk getting to match the hunks of machines...
","Well, Arnold does prove he's still in shape   at least to take the strip! Cyborg T-800 is back to deliver the stunts this brawny hunk can best put on screen: pound, lift, throw and clash against objects with loud, heavy bangs! But how does his stature compare against other hunk machines  to capture the loudest thuds and bangs? One can expect this flick to be a noisy, busy film that leaves the environment with wastes and debris.All this film offers are the non-stop sequences of intense chases, clashes, blasts and fuming blazes, cut in such fast paces to disallow room for emotional suspense. Admittedly, this film does have the most creative designs of vehicles and machines and captures the best effects when everything, including metallic heads, bang against each other. Doesn't that surge up memories of kids ferociously bashing up their Dinky toys to see what they can wreck and how much noise they can produce? Hey, whatever happened to the concept about humans destined to face Judgement Day because of the rise of evil machines? Or is this just about one John Connor who has to keep running for his life? The character development in this film is lame  it doesn't offer me reason to believe Connor's survival is relevant to the human race. I guess this film is telling us that humans are mostly in rehab!This sequel is over-streamlined with references to its two predecessors - with only a few new turns. The dialogue is simple  always giving prompt to predictable actions that follow. Arnold, in his guttural voice, gushes out many one-liners. Perhaps, the poor cyborg would be mumbling and jumbling up his speech, if he's given the opportunity to voice a mouthy bit. 
Nick Stahl may be cute as the young adult, Connor. But he can't match the cool Colin Farrell to mesmerize me. Clair Dane's Kate Brewster looks like a young version of Laura Bush.  Kristana Loken - more superior, new TX killing machine  but T-1000 has more memorable and interestingly complex characteristics. Not that it matters that Loken's TX has a pretty face?  She swings in to various forms, morph, dissipate, and turn into metallic energy. When she takes the human form, she walks like a robot and keeps her face emotionless. Boy, she's harder to kill than Willard's rat, Ben!
Evil Terminator comes to kill John Connor, and good old Terminator Arnold swings into the scenes to protect him. Changing the terminator into a girl ain't enough to keep the story captivating. With a budget past $180 million, I would have expected to see more realistic bodies hitting clashing against the various objects. Instead, those, flung in mid-air, seem more like rubbery dummies dangling in space before their images disappear from view. Jonathan Moslow's prop sets and special effects lack exuberance and wonder as a result of the overwelming repititions of clash and bangs. Just a chaotic mess of over-the-top crashes and explosions that gives little room for me to gasp with suspense and emotions for their characters!   
So, don't expect any hidden meanings, or expect the dialogue to arouse any exciting analysis discussions!  Don't expect to find any hidden agenda. Everything is what exactly flashes out on the screen. Not surprising, Arnold's voice booms out more easy-to-remember one-liners in this film. The special effects are not as dreamlike as those effects in Matrix 2. They are bold and fast-paced - there's not a moment spared for anyone to detect flaws! Yep, they work well for an action flick, allowing the viewers to be mesmerized with loads of chases and explosions. The story is pretty staid. For a dark subject like Judgement Day, I'd actually expected this sequel to carry deeper surreal themes. Arnold's character may be given more human emotions, the characters, but over all, all the characters lack interesting traits. It's definitely a film that's simply made busy with action sequences to keep me engaged. OK, I did have a hell of a good time watching the explosive stunts!       And so, about Skynet's attempt to fulfill the apocalyptic prediction... whoa I guess Arnold will hope to get us to see T4... unless he should be trapped with duty in his attempt to save California!  Watching this movie makes me realize how artically awesome the GCI aspects of Hulk is! D",Null,0,0,2 July 2003
The Orphanage," The fear of loss or death tends to run deep!
","If you're looking for an excellently crafted and engaging psychologically suspenseful thriller or chiller that consistently tests your emotional senses, this is an amazingly clever, artistically horrifying and spooky flick to see. For me, this film does bring back the haunting memories of films like The Devil's Backbone, The Haunting, The Sixth Sense, The Others, Pan's Labyrinth, and Tideland. Stylistically detailed in the film-making art, from the beginning to its end, this film does keep the audience's imagination running wild almost as if they have put themselves in the shoes of Belén Rueda's Laura. The themes of motherhood, fear, memories, fantasy, loss and death, jotting from frame to frame, are the film's vital elements that subject the audience to their interactions with all the characters, and to consistently sink them into fuzzy and unsettling imagination as well as profound panic. Indeed, this film has a very creative and unique way of dealing with fear, loss and death. Every piece of setting, background, and location is captivating and does keep the themes alive, playing and tugging at the viewers' emotions. Is this film a ghost story or is it about a mother's unwillingness to face up to reality? It's the sort of film that has no straight answers. Fortunately, this is not a film that applies cheesy shock-inducing tactics for the testing of the audience's reflex actions. Great script, great art direction, fabulously interesting and unique characters, and phenomenal performances! The characters do command the audience's compassion and attention throughout the film, And the audience will feel continuously trapped by forms of mysterious forces that are taking them on an unpredictable and creepy roller coaster ride in their attempt to distinguish between what's real or what's fantasy. And the music score? Masterfully accompanying the scenes to bring out suspense. Oh yes, this film does spooks and Laura's plight is so visually emotional to follow. The stunningly creepy scenes do persistently plague and play tricks to one's imagination. There are abundance of cool twists and turns and when the film ends, it would leave the audience eager for discussions. I was very surprised to learn that this wonderful masterpiece is the debut film of Director Bayona and Screenwriter Sanchez They absolutely bring so many brain-prodding and unforgettable moments to the story. An absolutely engaging and unforgettable film and my favorite foreign-language film of 2007!",10,6,11,2 January 2008
Ocean's Eleven," A Gentlemanly Team-Effort That Has Gotta Win...
","Ocean's 11 definitely shapes out a heist without the usual suspenseful superficialities to make this movie work. It's the traits of the articulated characters, parallel at times, but contrasting at most that bind the story and the characters with the scenes. Absolutely charming and stylistic! Sorderberg brilliantly carves out the ten criminals, detailing their individual skills through their dialogue.  Great dialogue too, so bitingly smug and graciously funny!  It's definitely one of the few movies that successfully avoid putting the viewers in stress with the attempt of deciding what and who to watch at any particular scene.  This is about a heist that needs to work because of team cooperation.  No mind-boggling visual effects, no martial arts tactics, but just a story that allows each role to be a part of a whole.  Watching each character is like watching a piece of puzzle carefully slotted into a jigsaw board.  This is what creates my interest throughout the film.  Every con comes through as a smooth character. as classy as the casino environment. Not even the theatrical grandiose of the casino, nor Julia Robert's beauty and performance,  will distract the viewers from their concentration on each member.  It's obviously a movie where cheers are for the crooks in their attempt to defeat a pompous braggart and his glorified environment! Observe Gargia's performance. definitely a great choice for the villain! And Pitt. it's his best acting performance so far!  Not to say that the acting skills of the rest of the cast members are lame! Not for a bit!  They all definitely fit well into their roles!  And they are believable. just like a diverse group of workers whose team effort, without vile nor violence, will bring success to any venture.

","SOME MONOR SPOILERS! A two-hour American military disaster expanded into a 3 hour and 3 minutes spectacle of Hollywood flaws! Totally a popcorn flick version of history! Yep, the half hour of special effects work well to prevent its failure to impress the audience! Filled with massive explosions, triggered with rousing orchestral swells and uncountable extras, it pumps up an enormous 'Hollywood' war, bombarding the viewers with loads of clichés and macho pomposities! Dramatic, no doubt; spectacular, for sure; and ghoulish, as expected... and everything's overtly commercialized!  Hey, it's a gigantic extravaganza to inflict the viewers' patriotic minds with visually compelling and unforgettable images. OK, it's entertainingly traumatizing,.. just like Star Wars' enchantment! Planes plummeting through the air and swooping between buildings; planes heading for the USS Arizona (blood-curling just to see its stock of torpedoes, bombs, and explosives!), Japanese bombs wreaking havoc, five battleships demolished, flames engulfing the harbor, thousands of men and women fighting for their lives, and salvage crews lifting the ship's gun turret to find bodies after bodies... a bunch of visual veracities garnished with an unimpressive and corny love-triangle yarn (marketing blitz, perhaps) that whops up a great deal of cheesy dialogue! A love story clearly without resonance and emotional pull! And the presence of undeveloped historical characters dabbed onto scenes to induce some historical credibility! Utterly a lame storyline with events flip-flopping between cinematic bliss and the writer's undeniably enthusiastic execution of romantic hoopla! Pardon me! If this film intends to show that America has lost its innocence with Pearl Harbor, it has failed miserably!

The Pianist," It's one man's soulful plight from the rein of terror...
","An incredibly touching film that keeps the audience embodied in the appalling ill-fate of Wladyslaw Szpilman and the ghetto Jews at Warsaw's Varsovia from 1939 to 1945.  And it's the cinematic portrayal of inhumane survival is simply astounding. It serves well in allowing the viewers to feel the eminent empathy of Szpilman. It's a film that seems to cry out for the audience to connect with the horror at a distance. Yet it leaves no room for superficiality but allows each frame of event glows with gradual transcendence.  Roman Polanski's style of on screen narration is truly awesome and unique. He injects an enormous sensitivity of human feelings into this masterpiece through his principal character.  It's a Holocaust film,  solidly and powerfully approached with surrealism, realism, and cynicism. And its contents are without the overwhelming and overlapping necessity of injecting the visual GCI escapades of gore and hype, as used in many Hollywood Holocaust films to channel emotions. He uses GCI effects intelligently, recreating the scenes of structural bleakness. And call it courage, perhaps, Polanski does acknowledge that Varsovia has its good and evil residents, existing from all walks of life, and from varied creeds, cultures and classes. Based on Szpilman's 1946 novel, this movie is slapped with abundance of visual horrors associated with one man's emotions in his struggle to stay alive. Yep, this film does pound on one man's experience of the inescapable dehumanizing aspects shown to, or faced by people, within a war zone, as well as on the possibility of human kindness, associated with the terror of war. Eerie and absolutely haunting... almost as if Director Roman Polanski is filming a documentary of a man's survival plight from a petrifying insane asylum where no man survives without turning traitor, or without the fortune of helping hands! The gray landscapes and, oft times, the pure silence add to the effects of numbness to the scenes. They echo one fugitive's trauma within an ugly period of history. Roman Polanski does not bombard his movie with the use of visual bloody gore and grime to cast the ghastliness of Szpilman's story. Instead, viewers are led to follow Szpilman's moves, feeling his alleviating fear and consternation, watching the happenings as he sees. This film captures, non-stop, the moods of desperation and struggle. We pause, we gape, in total silence and heaviness, while each scene flows.  We wonder how long before he too will be packed into a cattle truck to be sent off to Treblinka.  With every act that Szpilman makes, the viewers are inclined to feel they are in his shoes, searching, escaping, and feeling the cold sweat of numbness  at oft times void of emotions, almost parallel to the deserted and desiccated, eerie city portrayed without its signs of life. The story deals with the creepy take on human dehumanization, bringing an uncanny composition of trodden despair on to the screen. All the dehumanizing events appear as if at a distant and only through his eye  without the usual coaxing of GCI effects of visual gore or slaughter. Everything appears through curtain-drawn windowpanes or window cracks, and through small openings of doors and walls. But it's how the Szpilman character reacts to what he sees that keeps me shaken and mesmerized throughout the film.  Those abstract onscreen emotions keep the movie alive just as Szpilman's music has kept him alive. In addition, the film's bleak surroundings and the tragedy of the tortured man's character render a thematically and artistically eerie outlook to the film's moods.
Adrien Brody is truly deserving of an Oscar nomination for his performance. If one has seen a photo of the real youthful Szpilman, one can see some facial resemblance between the actor and the real individual. Szpilman, once a renowned and dignified musician has become sickly, intimidated, alone and very desperately hungry. The only strength left in him is for staying alive. The only belief he holds is his music. I was immensely captivated by Brody's facial and bodily expressions, both at the time of his character's fame, and thereafter by his portrayal of the character's fear, hunger and destitution. He brings out a credible Szpilman thrown into a downright appalling and inhuman situation where only miracles could save him. Brody plunges me right into the heart of his character's journey of fatigued mental sufferings, while witnessing with him the blanched and distantly terror of Varsovia.  My response: I felt ill and isolated, and completely in pain and fear till the finale.  That's how powerful Brody projects his acting talent.  That's how powerful this film is. Powerfully told with the powerful on screen images! Overall, the cast ensemble aptly supports Brody's role. The music of his Szpilman also establishes an amazing tone and feel of the surroundings. Chopin's Nocturne in C Sharp minor still plagues my ears. It comes through three most unforgettable moments: the first instance when the explosion of the German bomb hits the audience's eyes, and when Szpilman plays it to the German officer, Wilm Hosenfeld, and when it filters through the Polish Radio.  Truly exhilarating!This is definitely a poignant and memorable movie to see  especially during our own contemporary times of terror.",Null,0,0,13 December 2002
Seabiscuit," Seabiscuit is a winner...
","A fabulous movie! It offers credibility to the old saying that 'if there's a will, there's a way.' It's a great reminder that there had been people - of yesteryears - who had been brave and courageous to accept the underdogs with heartfelt benevolence.As a film, revolving around the inspiring story of Seabiscuit, it works well. It connects the cultural icon with the life paths of three men of different social standings, leading me through a mixed journey of tragedies and jubilation, risks, disappointments and exuberance. It shows how these men and beast overcome incredible odds to achieve their goals. The bonding of the quartet is wonderfully captured in this film. Watching the horse transformed into a winner is as aesthetically beautiful as seeing 'Cinderella' transformed into a beauty by her three 'fairy godmothers.' This film has a compelling story that salutes the American dream.This adaptation of Laura Hillenbrand's book, unfortunately, does omit a great deal of the interesting biographical accounts of the trio's lives and the historical impressions of the nation's era between 1903-1940. But Director Gary Ross (watch out for his cameo appearance) does provide sufficient background to the lives of Charles Howard, Jim Smith and Red Pollard to justify how the trio becomes ultimately involved with the life of Seabiscuit. The small spirited bay is first introduced as a colt, and Red as a young kid, both ultimately separated from their parents, and both subjecting the viewers never to forget their crooked legs and their predisposition for indolence!  Strangely, the film does show many similarities, in traits and circumstances, between Seabiscuit and Red. Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper and Toby Maguire are impressive in their roles. They are convincing sources to what is meant by perseverance and triumph. William H. Macy does 'tick-tock' through several scenes to provide the comic relief.The film is filled with dramatically charming appeal and beauty, yet it has not failed to expose the brutality of horseracing.  even if Seabiscuit's glory had distracted millions away from the political, social and economic woes of their times. The visuals for the story's historical era are wonderfully detailed, creating a sense of realism to the period, the characters and events.  The choice of Randy Newman's music scores helps build up the viewers' emotions especially in the race scenes.

28 Days Later...," Beware Animal Rights Protestors, avoid opening the Pandora's Box!
","A simple story with simple, background images, yet this film is stunningly effective  successfully offering the feeling that rage' sets off the time bomb in summoning Armageddon!  Of course, this movie would have made better sense for the audience to see more heaps of dead bodies strewn on the streets of London, or more blood-thirsting, zombie-like monsters roaming around this city, killing one another. But is the writer, Alex Garland, or Director Danny Boyle, hinting to viewers that birds of the same feather always flock together? Yet, the solitary London street scenes succeed in invoking the apocalyptic' feeling. The hello cries of Jim echoes the same. And the military base' in Manchester does summon up the sort of chaos that could easily mark the end of the world.  One nice aspect to this film: it offers the viewers to see a microcosm of a nation where fear and death siren from corner to corner  all as a result of some ignorant souls opening the Pandora's Box!   
The film focuses nicely on the theme of survival. It moves at an interesting pace to keep the audience wondering who'd be the next victim. Could a handful of travelers from London find salvation with the help of the military in Manchester?  Death lurks - and the theme of 'death' stays with the viewers all through this film. What is interesting is the way the survivors' are portrayed... none of relative importance. Basically ordinary folks like you and me  trying to keep alive and out of danger when fear strikes! The audience will be perpetually put on edge as they watch the characters move helter-skelter during the cat-and-mouse chases. Yep, be also prepared for the shadows lurking dangerously around the bend.
The film seems to show that the actors don't have to try to sweep the viewers off their feet with their outstanding performances. There isn't any poetic or flowery dialogue. Characters who have to run amok in films don't have to try to impress anyone with their Shakespearean tongues.  Ordinary folks, who are being attacked in a war zone' doing what they can to stay alive  running!  There's every expectation that there's not a single minute to waste. The cast ensemble works well for this movie and does make the plot work. They bring credibility to their eventful escapade moments.  One can't help being swept in to every chaotic scene, feeling as helpless as Jim and his companions  and thinking what people facing death would do.
What do I think of the ending of this film? It does leave room for thought. I do prefer happy endings to all movies and am inclined to see `Hello' as a symbolic hint. B+",Null,0,0,24 June 2003
No Man's Land," A Panoramic Ambiance That Chills...
","MINOR SPOILERS... BEWARE A fabulously executed and surreal war satire that definitely is a worthwhile movie to see! Visually traumatic; mentally disturbing; and fabulously directed with a cast of solid performers!  This movie is a wake-up call to a lose-lose scenario about a futile war.  A modest movie without the usual Hollywood frills of blasting music scores or computer generated gimmicks, yet so impressively energetic!  And it sets forth credible characters in believable situations, allowing none to come out smarter.
This movie probes into the absurd and the inhumane aspects of wars and their participants..  Danis Tanovic's three main characters enable the viewers to accept the fact that neither the Croatians nor the Serbs are victors in the Balkan wars.  Mind-gripping events of the pointless war with profoundly cynical conversations between Branko Djuric's Ciki and Rene Bitorajac's Nino that clearly projects the writer's viewpoints onto the screen. Yep, two enemies, face-to-face -- in no man's land between their respective front lines! Two men, trapped by their circumstances, only to resort to violence! And in the background lies Ciki's comrade, Cera, whose booby-trapped position creates an additional tension throughout the film. Tanovic further dramatizes the story with a group of clueless and confused French UN peacekeepers and a plainly obnoxious troupe of journalists.their very presence does profess more cynicism about the purpose of international involvement in the war.  Overall, this movie gives insights to, not only an ethnic war, but to the conflicting tensions that are caused by the press media and the UN, the soldiers and the peacekeepers.Despite the seriousness and grimness of Tanovic's themes, this movie pumps up a great deal of humor.absolutely dark amidst the most tragic moments. Two thumbs up for Tanovic. his script and his directorial composition are remarkable. truly well deserving of some Oscar statuettes!",Null,0,1,18 December 2001
K-19: The Widowmaker," It's heart and patriotism without war...
","This movie is a true treat worth the price of a regular tix... to open  my eyes to another piece of lost history!Kathryn Bigalow's awesome direction provides an engrossing intensity to this 1961 piece of Russian history, which almost included a Chernobyl-like disaster, and a nuke war between the world's two super powers, at the height of the cold war era! Hey, if a Russian nuke disaster should happen near a Nato military base, what else can one expect? I like the way the film supports the historical facts at the beginning and ending of the film. There are so many scenes that fold without predictabilities and that makes the film so amazingly suspenseful and touching.  The accent of any performer is never a bother to me - as long as the dialogue doesn't slip from my hearing.I find this film to be dramatically powerful and welcome the overwhelming throw of actions, happily short of any overwhelmingly spluttering of CGI effects! This film draws the viewers into the events at a wonderful pace, accompanied by the astounding Kirov Orchestral soundtracks. Boy, am I glad I wasn't one of those trapped in the submarine with the leaks, heat, explosions and radioactivity. Great character development; fabulous screen chemistry between all the actors! Oh yes, I enjoyed watching Harrison Ford's character with his cold and stoic expressions  - almost inhumane! Hey, did any of you see Harrison's tears slowly streaming from his eyes? A fabulous shot from the lens! And Liam Neeson's performance is astounding, never failing to convince the audience that he's a gentleman, very deserving of the respect from his men! And the two guys' opposing traits are magnetically intriguing. They are a pair of conflicting and snappy characters, facing a catastrophic arena.  And it's impossible not for the viewers to be equally and emotionally attracted to their ideals.  This film definitely is a revelation of what honorable heroes do in the name of honor, service and duty  without actually fighting a war! Amazing!My salute to those heroes who remained true to their comrades and died, preventing a world nuke-war! This film succeeds in tearing my heart out for those dead Russian heroes. And thumbs up to the National Geographic Society for its ability to guide a multi-international team to create such an astounding film!My rating: A",Null,1,2,16 July 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Ecstasy and agony at best!
","Impresario extraordinaire! Two thumbs up for Baz Luhrmann for this flamboyant production! An opulent & breathtaking movie with spotlights on the fin-de-siecle pleasures of the era's Parisian cabaret - the exotic rendezvous haunt for dreamers and for those seeking an exuberant and licentious life! Watching this flick is like watching Toulouse-Lautrec's paintings come alive!  Whoa, `C'est viva la Montmartre' in operatic sensation!  Yep, a series of phenomenally busy-busy scenes with fabulous touches of melodious panache to hold back the audiences' breath! The cooing of great favorites from The Sound of Music to the Beetles!  OK, this is a film that defies the era's historical authenticity with close to two and a half hours of these contemporary pops and musicals, yet it incorporates them very nicely to emphasize the scenes and replace the dialogue! Fascinating and truly creative!  Overall, everything about this movie fits in like a stunning mosaic piece of art! It carries the spirit of Bernstein's West Side Story, Bonblil's Les Miserables and Chamin's Can-Can... truly a combination of agony and ecstasy! This flick is a non-stop lashing out of everything symbolic of exuberant entertainment! Brilliant, extravagant, and outrageously mesmerizing! Powerfully cinematic with glamour at best! Yet it embraces Montmartre's bohemian life with a bizarre circus quality about it! And within the exotic fantasia lie the telltale of seedy encounters, corruption, prostitution, and the tragedy of a dramatic Romeo-Juliet romance! It's a clandestine love yarn rooted amidst virtue, sins, power, beauty and frantic gaiety! And Satine inflicted with tuberculosis?  Not unbelievable! That was the period when tubercle bacillus was identified. Superb cast of talents... they spell out the personalities beautifully! Hey, and it's not fake lip service from McGregor and Kidman... their singing voices are praiseworthy! If there are flaws in this production, I personally care less! The well-choreographed cancan razzmatazz, the music numbers, the colorful costumes and the poignant tragedies actually fired away my complete regard for flaws! Gosh, one fast entertaining scene stomping off from another with such rapid shots. I simply sank into my seat at the end...  so fabulously awed and deeply touched by the finale! Just can't wait to see it again! My rating: A+",Null,1,2,29 May 2001
8 Mile," Rapping to freedom...
","It's a very well told tale of a white rapper's life, his fears, his music, and his ability to conquer his hurdles  in an environment where dreams, hopes and anger could only be embodied in lyrics. It may be seen as a controversial film, but it's honestly portrayed.  It may be propagated with offensive lyrical assaults, but it's definitely sung to Eminem's tune. This film seems to demand an understanding of a rapper's culture that is built around his social and situational circumstances.Watch how the young white guy struggle, against all odds, to make something out of his inescapable life and surroundings. Raised by a mother, who obviously has need of redemption herself, Eminem's charismatic Jimmy `Rabbit' Smith character is introduced at the beginning of the film as a total loser. Viewers get to see both arenas of his gentle and his raging temperament.  Jimmy moves back to his mother's trailer-park home in white suburban 8 Mile, Detroit, and yet can't really see it as home'. His financially stricken, trashy mother lugs around the house with a gigolo louse, not much older than Jimmy.  And his little sister, Lily, spends most of her time, cuddled up in some corner, cringed with fear and apprehension. That's what's to be expected of his life at 'home'. The young man has a meager-paying job, working under a tough and overbearing supervisor in a metal stamping plant. He hangs around his loyal group of friends from a tough and dilapidated inner city. Future (Mekhi Phifer) is Rabbit's fervent admirer, believing that his friend has great potentials to achieve stardom. Evan Jones' Bob, Omar Benson Miller' Sol; and De'Angelo Wilson's DJ Iz linger along with the two, almost like loyal pets. We see them in a club, frequented by young black rappers and their fans. Most likely, it's the only social joint for this inner city folks.  Jimmy meets Brittany Murphy' Alex and she sets the stage for getting Jimmy out of his in-built reservation.  Hey, she and Eminem do have very appealing onscreen chemistry! Truly a fine cast of actors who have definitely brought credibility to their screen characters.  It's these characters, together with Jimmy's mother  her messed-up character is wonderfully crafted out by Kim Basinger  who help in the carving of the gradual on-screen development of Jimmy's maturity. This film makes a good study of a young man trying hard to balance his responsibilities toward his family, his friends and his job.
There are many great scenes that support Jimmy's determination to conquer his troubling challenges.  The loser' is seen as getting his honky-tonk car to run, bringing his mother to overcome her insecurity, fighting off his shyness, providing comfort for his sister, winning respect from his boss, beating his rival in the hip-hop game, and gaining complete acceptance from the `ghetto' club crowd.  And the manner, in which Jimmy chants out his abusive lyrics, plays an important part in portraying the different levels of his confidence development. The ending is phenomenal. We get to see Jimmy walking away, like a man who is freed from his troubled world and from his dilemma  but more important freed from the bondage of everyone.  He has found his voice to empower his stance over every troubling circumstance! He achieves in bringing out his best in an awkward world.  
Scott Silvers script, with its unpretentious storyline and characters, is definitely worthy of an Oscar. A well directed film that will definitely please Eminem's fans and the hip-hop loyalists.",Null,0,1,6 November 2002
Shrek 2," Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder...
","As a sequel, this movie does not disappoint.  Shrek and Fiona take on a fresh episode of their lives, leaving the viewers with a track of characters and events - without the presentation of repetitious scenarios from the film's prequel and assert boredom as so many contemporary sequels tend to offer. Flamboyantly hilarious and captivating, Shrek 2 continues its story, carrying with it just as much refreshing boldness, fun and energy. Yep, this film dazzles as a wicked comedy, satirically embedded with recognizable fairy tale and movie characters that are wittily crafted to provide a totally different assessment our memories of their beauty or of their flaws. Yep, scenes and characters move at an enormously fast pace to keep the viewers thrilled with laugher. Yep, there isn't any dull moment to this film. There's plenty to keep the young fairy tale book readers mesmerized, and there are a abundance of cleverly crafted insinuations to flirt with the adults' minds. Yep this film is cool and wild, offering a never-ending sequence of funny twists to make this movie worth seeing, again and again. Young or old, the audience will, very likely, be tickled to tears, watching the stronghold of fairytale conventions being ruptured.    
Never `judge a book by its cover' comes across as a strong theme in this film.  From the vast ensemble of interesting characters, the younger viewers will learn to appreciate that beauty is definitely in the eyes of the beholder and not skin-deep. I can't think of another animated film that has - without the usual superficial and condescending tendencies - so creatively associate character interactions with physical appearances to sell this crucial moral lesson to younger viewers.   Our two beloved green ogres return to the screen with more adventures, meeting more characters to render their love or hate. Like all good fairy tales, Good Samaritan' charity tends to be the best weapon for winning a war. Be assured: Donkey, their annoyingly talkative, will, once again, try to steal the limelight  but Puss in Boots won't be letting Donkey steal the show. Overall, all the characters are truly marvelous to watch. If Larry King has a cameo appearance, he's definitely not easy to spot. Oh yes, those film allows Joan Rivers to celebrate her infamous appeal at the Golden Globe's, or the Oscar's Red Carpet' walkway.      The film carries a simple storyline but there are plenty of scenes, spiced up, in comedic fashion, to test the meaning of love.'  How will Fiona react to the `Little Mermaid' flirtation with Shrek during the couple's honeymoon at the `From Here to Eternity' beach? How will their lives be affected in Far Far Away Land when Shrek eventually gets to `Meet the Parents'?  Can Fiona's parents truthfully ` Guess Who's Coming to Dinner'? What if Fiona's Fairy Godmother still holds up to her dream of tying the `Happily Ever After' knot between Fiona and the Prince Charming? Will the Ogres find the `Mission Impossible' to stay faithful to their love?     
As the scenes shift from the Ogres' home in the swamp to the graces of Far Far Away, the audience is treated with spoof-spins on snobby Beverly Hills. Yep, watch out for the non-stop parodies of  `Cops', `Knights' and `Casper.' Be sure to look for the likes of Jack and his Beanstalk, Rapunzel, Red Riding Hood, et. al.  Yep, the audience will have fun, picking out their favorite fairy-tale characters, from scene after scene of alluringly and fascinating visual settings. There's plenty not to be missed  visually and audibly. It's hard not to enjoy the snappy and spontaneously sharp and witty dialogue. And the catchy songs are brilliantly spun to correlate to the scenes and actions.   A very entertaining animated film that keeps the audience smiling and laughingA",Null,0,0,21 May 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," An adrenaline-driven coaster-ride through gratingly bold and captivating martial-arts extravaganza.
","Sure it's outlandishly violent and bloody. Can anyone expect Tarantino's movie not to be a true mind-blowing, adrenaline-pumping shocker?  Of course not!  Gritty and slick, his first installment of KB rocks with moody western imagery, the '60s and '70s-era of Hong Kong martial arts-action, the influences of the ritualistic samurai swordsmanship, and Japanese anime. Like in all his films, Tarantino never fails to merge dark humor with terror. It's impossible not to smile over the Shaw Bros.' iconic introduction ploy and the De Palma-esque split screens. Observe the `Carrie' blank-starry eyed image settled on The Bride's gory face as she's introduced to the audience. Perhaps, Uma Thurman in her yellow suit is a salute to the yellow-suited Bruce Lee in his last film, The Game of Death. Or is The Bride 'Just another little Western girl playing at being a samurai' - as O-Ren Ishii blatantly puts it?This film's a sampling of the Tarantino 'fury,' short of the Tarantino customary fiery tongue. It celebrates the Tarantino trademark of avoiding the use of computer-generated CGI special effects. It's almost as if I'm watching a colorful and bloodied kabuki stage that's displaying a stunningly massive tournament of multi-layered kung-fu and female samura sword-fighting styles to dazzle the audience. It's examining how Tarantino catalogues the great stylistic elements of his favorite 'old-school' filmmakers and transforms them into a phenomenally creative and mesmerizing film. Yep, there's a great deal of captivatingly artistic boldness in this film. Powerfully portrayed and not to be easily forgotten. Violently brutal and gloriously gory without doubt, and yet so aesthetically operatic and astoundingly artful. The music and lyrics that accompany the scenes are astounding. They set the moods so appropriately with the events.
Even at 'The House Of Blue Leaves', we get to see Tarantino weaving the artistic styles of Lucio Fulci, Chang-Che, Sergio Leone, Kurosawa, Zhang Yimou and Busby Berkeley to bring the audience a stylistic exhibit of remarkable montage grandeur. The themes of betrayal and revenge come off strong. Every camera shot and scene seems to scream out, non-stop, `Kill Bill and all of Bill's DVAS members.'  My adrenaline's still flowing as I'm recalling the scenes. Tarantino has make a solid point with this film to show that martial arts scenes should stick to the artful and realistic choreographic treatment to sustain the true spiritual spirit of martial arts.

Black Hawk Down," HAUNTING TRIGGERS OF HUMAN EMOTIONS IN ACTION...
","SPOILERS... BEWARE!What a haunting movie filled with an explosion of graphic realism! I've never been more traumatized with any other war movie since 'Apocalypse Now.' All the adrenaline-pumping feelings that came with the book flooded back on screen.  This is not a movie about the politics of Somalia war, nor is it one that's meant to impress anyone with exhibits of sophisticated military gadgets and surveillance techniques. This is about a collective group of honorable men willing to die for their honor and for their buddies. Plato's words: `Only the dead have seen the end of war,' at the beginning of the film, sums up the contents of this film and Evermann's final statement, at the end, confirms my expectations. This is the story about soldiers who are not out to try to be heroes, but end up doing things that make them heroic.
Two Black Hawk helicopters shot down; men trapped in a perilous city gone crazy.  The Director has superbly captured the personal accounts of the dangers, frustrations, fear and grief of the soldiers on the s***ty Mogadishu battlefield. This movie provides an uncanny exhibit of distressing portrayal of human behavioral struggles, inherent and unpredictable. It's watching members of the US Rangers and of the Delta Force as if they were badly manipulated pieces on a chessboard. No organized moves only to be faced with surprised attacks! Most of the soldiers were very young men called to battlefield mission for their first time; many are from the Rangers infantry.  Their implied well-planned task was to capture two of warlord Mohamed Aidid's high-ranking deputies.  But they soon discovered that their real combat engagement was different from their routine training. Young men in their early twenties summoned to serve with cocky and arrogant members of the Delta troupe.This movie is not about the soldiers' individual characteristics or traits; it's about it's about a team of men struggling  for survival on a historically ill-fated day.  Embattled young victims of erroneous circumstances! Clean-cut young men filled with optimism at the beginning but had to live through hell the moment they are dropped into the `Mog.'  An hour's mission turned into 15 hours of helpless desperation. Commandos and Rangers at odds! Indeed, this is a movie that spells out their experience, confusion, fear, courage, bravery, convictions, loyalty and dignity. I watched in horror seeing the handful of Deltas plunging out of a convoy to get to a crashed chopper on foot.  I gasped as I watched hands foraging into Sgt. Smith's cauterized pelvis to grab and clamp a retracted artery.  I choked to see the splattered blood, guts, and body parts merging with mud. I grieved watching people shot and senseless deaths. Their fears were mine! Nineteen American soldiers, and hundreds of Somali men, women and children, killed as a result of one foreign policy gone disastrous and chaotic!
Ridley Scott has definitely succeeded in exhibiting the inhumane brutality faced by men at war. So much visual details to leave viewers with moment-by-moment accounted chronicle of the living nightmare for the men involved. The spectacular cinematic effects and moods combined with the astounding Hans Zimmer's eclectic music score certainly pump up a hellish atmoshere throughout the movie. I was entirely mesmerized and psychologically blown to bits as if my own body was being mutilated. Yep, I felt as if I was right in the heart of the battlefield, panicking and trying to stay alive throughout the two hours and twenty-five minutes of this film. Astounding and realistic camera shots and amazingly credible cast of acting talents!  A phenomenal war film that focuses brilliantly on human emotions and spirit. it gets my A+ rating!",Null,1,2,19 January 2002
Big Fish," Fact, fiction, or exaggeration, nothing makes a fish bigger than almost being caught.
","This is what I'd call one of the most brilliantly fun movie I've seen this year. It captures the fantasy and myths that any creative mind could present. There are lots of flashbacks that not only drive the viewers to the clues to the young Bloom's colorful life. The story's full of colorful characters that are a joy to watch. And don't dare tell me that the Bloom character couldn't be anyone living within our community. Believe me, they exist. those dear souls that are only too happy to tell their tales, over and over again because some one listening had, at one time or another, seemingly had with wide-eyed interest.This film, directed by Tim Burton, and with its story adapted from Daniel Wallace's novel of the same, is AWESOME. The storytelling process is phenomenal, with every character marching in and out of scenes worthy of a study. Although the ideas stay close to the book, some of the feelings and traits of the film's characters are personal touches of the Director and the Producer, as the Q&A with Richard Zanuck discloses. The father-son relationship is soulfully developed in the story. The audience is lead on a journey, discovery, capturing who really is Edward Bloom and what had happened to the period of his absence from his family.  While the camera shots focus solidly on Ewan McGregor's and Albert Finney's Ed, they never rob me of my interest in the rest of the supporting cast and their characters. Every one and everything fits like well-fitted jigsaw puzzles needed to a fabulous and colorful masterpiece of quilt.  The cinematic effects are astoundingly beautiful. and I do mean aesthetically stunning! I was sucked into all kinds of emotions as I watched the characters interact, and actually, at oft times, feeling my eyebrows rising unexpectedly.
I love everything about this movie. including its wackiness.  My chest was heaving and I was unconsciously giving out constant gasps of disbelief towards the finale. The symbolisms are fun to decipher. and they leave the audience with plenty to discuss at the end.  There are very few movies that allow me to react constantly to the characters from scene to scene. This is one of them. This film offered me a journey of fun, fantasy and emotions. I gasped, I sighed; I cried and laughed as reality hit me. It has a wonderful cast of actors that alone will drive one to see it. It has become a film I'd see over and over again. Indeed, a worthy Oscar WINNER! Brilliant. absolutely brilliant film with a wonderful story! Albert Finney is phenomenal; Ewan McGregor is mesmerizing.I'd suggest reading the book after you've seen the film. the surprising twists (2 exceptional ones for me!) are what will give you a greater climax of thrill and joy at the end. This is the sort of movie I can watch over and over again.A",Null,0,0,5 December 2003
Avatar," It ought to draw us to debate the love-hate relationship of science and technology!
","It's interesting and it's exotic, and so imaginatively rendered! Indeed, a cinematic thrill-ride! The film's CGI effects deliver a natural and unspoiled world to compare with a world of machines, and its digital characters are gorgeously stunning to behold! And the film does seem like one amazing futuristic action-battle razzmatazz, directed with the most uncanny computer-generated 3-D technological feat, James Cameron's epic film is, in fact, an eco-minded epic, gastulated with the most humanly issues, universally familiar ever since the colonial times. Indeed, the film's rich themes are immensely dark! Indeed, its story injects themes of colonization, imperialism, militarism, cultural differences and cross-cultural communication, and genetic engineering...all of which any misstep taken could be disastrous to peace, nature and humanity. Needless to say, this film does again echo Cameron's trademark film themes of corporate greed and the love-hate relationships with technology. Indeed, like the love between Jack and Rose in Titanic,' this love between the movie's Jake and Nevtiri, is solid that could only wither when 'death doth them part.' And in war, there will always be those who'd be willing to fight as long as it's a just war, as exemplified by Michelle Rodriquez' Trudy. James Cameron's film captures two worlds... Earth that is highly and technologically advanced and which we are familiar, and the other, a seemingly 'primitive' and physically-fit civilization of the Pandora planet, in which terrain and life remains little altered since God's generous Creation! The year is 2154, the year when modern and advanced technology has given way to the moist exclusive and unique weaponry and robotic achievements for war and science does allow avatars to be created for one human race to look like another. Wouldn't anyone be as flattered as Sam Worthington's Jake Sully to be selected to be as part of the exploration team of the exotic Na'vi world, especially when it's headed by the brilliant botanist, Sigourney Weaver' Grace. After all, their mission is for the good of human curiosity, scientific research, and knowledge! After all, Jake does understand that his twin brother had died while on the same mission, and that, he has the same genetic match of his brother to easily replace him without posing any unsuspecting lab complication. As we follow the wheel-chair bound Marine veteran in his avatar status into the Pandora planet, what is captured is so amazingly dreamlike. It's a world filled with mysticism, and in which nature thrives in absolute pure beauty and in abundance, with blue-skinned, golden-eyed, and very tall and slender beings functioning with and around nature, and complying with nature's forces... sans technology; sans machines. Indeed, an absolute contrast to Jake's own harsh world of man-created machines and scientific labs! Though the presence of Grace serves to remind Jake of his mission, it is in Pandora that Jake finds his rebirth of life.... his ability to walk and fly without constraints, a refreshingly new way to live, and he is also falling in love. And Jake does enter a world in which unimaginable creatures, like viperwolves, thanators, and banshees,roam! Oh, I do love the scenes in which Zoe Saldana's Neytiri, under the order of her mother, the Na'vi shaman Moat, teaches Jake the survival tactics of the Omaticaya people. My favorite moments are when Jake tries to control and bond with a banshee, and later, with the Direhorse! But when Jake discovers the real reasons for the interests of Center's Administrator (Giovanni Ribisi's Parker Selfridge) and Stephen Lang's Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) in the Pandora planet, will he continue his mission? The Pandora planet has a rich natural resource, a rare and valuable mineral called unobtanium, deposited beneath a Hometree. Will Jake continue his scouting for Colonel Quaritch's soldiers and lead them to the mineral deposits? And will Grace and all her team members, including Jake, support the exploitations of Pandora's inhabitants? Will Jake betray his Earth people and can he be able to win Neytiri and the Na'vi people's trust? What if he goes against Selfridge and Colonel Quaritch? After all, these evil and greedy two have access to the lab that controls his avatar! What follows is our observance of the character dealing with their conscience, as Pandora continues to face attacks and destruction, both from ground and from air, as nature and people are blown to bits! The amazing CGI effects make the battle - between Earth's military-industrial forces and the oppressed, arrow-bearing inhabitants of the Pandora planet - very engaging. And Director Cameron does take his story to its climax, ultimately reminding us that nature is not a force to be reckoned. And ultimately, this film is about 'good' winning over 'evil.' Every character, human or digital, is interesting to follow, providing his or her conscience to his/her role in delivering the film's themes, And overall, the film is spectacularly mesmerizing and very enjoyable!",10,78,145,20 December 2009
Invictus," A marvelous film to flash us back to South Africa's most precious historical moments...
","Indeed, a lovely and feel good movie that reminds us how a nation so stricken by apartheid and rebellions, and 14,000 civilians dead, is able to heal, and its turning point in history in reconciliation and strife for democracy. Director Clint Eastwood's film does pay tribute to both Nelson Mandela and the captain of the previously hated Springboks rugby team, Francois Pienaar for the Springboks's epic win against New Zealand's All Blacks with the final 15-12 score at the 1995 World Rugby Cup, as well as for their initiating the first major step towards white and black South Africans living together in acceptance. And that famous hand shake we see in the film really does speak a lot. The match between the two teams at Johannesburg's Ellis Park Stadium in 1995 is so phenomenally presented on screen. Boy, it does look so real that I can't help myself cheering for the Springboks as if it's a life event! Eastwood, too, brings humor in the film. Boy, that famous moment with the All Black's gigantic superstar being tackled near the try-line by the big size Springboks defender! And the black and white Presidential guards gradually building up their trust in one another! These are so captivatingly funny. And with minutes ticking and Stransky does his amazing kick, sending the ball almost 100 ft to strike the drop goal to deliver the final score for Springboks' victory is so stunningly awesome! Fabulous film direction from Director Eastwood! The scenes with Matt Damon's visit to the prison are extraordinarily chilling, and fabulously crafted... reminding the viewers of the 27 yeas of prison and hard labor Mandela had to go through in his fight for his people's freedom against the NP's apartheid programs. Director Eastwood's film offers incredible spot on with facts, to include the Springboks' green and gold jerseys with their Springbok and Protea emblems! And, after the Springboks made their epic win over the All Blacks, watching Morgan Freeman's Mandela presenting the trophy to Matt Damon's Francois Pienaar while wearing a Springbok shirt with Pienaar's own number 6 on the back, it's impossible not to be touched by that scene. Indeed, the many, who had watched that particular match in 1995 Rugby World Cup, can relate to that scene as seen live on TV worldwide. Morgan Freeman does play Mandela to a tee, Mandela's frailty, his gait, his charm and the way Mandela talks and smiles! And Damon is also no lesser credible as an Afrikaner rugby captain! Anyone familiar with Francois Pienaar would be able see Damon and Pienaar's physical builds are pretty similar. Boy, oh boy, do I love his Afrikaner accent! Indeed, my best feature film seen so far for the Oscar race. A true work of artistic film-making value that superbly unfolds South Africa's major historical events and moments! To observe the faces of hope on screen is so heartwarming. I certainly hope that this film and both Freeman and Damon would be getting Oscar nominations. I really can't wait to get all my family members and friends to see this film! Best feature film I've so far seen for the Oscar race!",10,22,33,8 December 2009
The Last Samurai," It's capturing the dramatic human emotions with the fading of traditions
","An enchanting epic of immense proportions! - to stun  the audience with cinematic wonder!  The scenes flip-flop in our eyes with not only very intense, but phenomenally sensual and breathless moments. The silent passions' between Tom Cruise's Capt. Algren and Koyuki's Taka is the sweetest cinematic moments I've seen this year  for this alone, I'd see this film several times! Through the narration of Tom Cruise's Captain Algren, a Civil War hero, the audience is given to understand how economic interests had paved the way for the Meiji Emperor's administration to destroy the Samurai cultures. Through his story, the consequences of Japan's forcible modernization, in the 1870s, are devastatingly painful to watch. The Captain's story also offers an insight into Japan's revamping of war tactics with the help of the U.S. Government. This seemingly must be the era when the stocks of Civil War artillery, including the Winchester repeating rifles and the Gatling guns, started to cross over the oceans from America to foreign soils. The audience watches as pragmatism replaces courage, self-interest steals the place of sacrifice and honor becomes an ancient phenomenon. Kudos to Director Zwick - the battle between the Samurais and the Imperial Army is extraordinarily STUNNING!  He succeeds in allowing the audience to capture the facial emotions of men in the battlefield without letting the scenes ramble in chaotic mess with the over-kill of CGI special effects.Cruise brings a mesmerizing exhibit to his Algren character. From the expressions of a man disillusioned by his shamefully cynical with his American Civil War experiences, to the impressions of a men where nothing else matters safe for the alcohol and financial gains, and then gradually succumbing to his spiritual discipline before he flouts against the ideals of imperialism and takes command at the warfront Cruise's performance is astounding.  Hey, Cruise will even heave up some unsuspected laughter from the audience with one beautifully crafted scene. Koyuki in her role as Taka brings unforgettable delight and aesthetic beauty to the screen.  The onscreen chemistry between them is deliciously portrayed  I'd be surprised if watching the pair together doesn't set every viewer's heart pounding! Cruise offers a credible performance of a man whose facial countenance and features changes with his moods, temperament and sensitivity. I felt I was watching a Shakespearean drama encompassed with the depth and breath of rich elegance and imagery as in Matsuo Basho and Masaoka Shiki's haiku. 
Every camera exposure of the scenes in this film, and of characters and their interactions is magnificent treated.  The characters may be fictionalized, but the story is quilted with the interesting historical and cultural aspects of that Japanese era. Ken Watanabe offers a striking performance with his tall and stately, yet so graciously portrayed Katsumoto, the Last Samurai.'  He looks so immaculate on screen!  His character is based on Takamori Saigo, the 19th Century heroic figure known for his patriotism and services. Every member in this film beautifully fits into his/her role. The cinematography is fantastic.  The music score and soundtracks are simply astounding streaming in and out of scenes to create a riveting experience for the audience.   This is a film definitely is worth seeing.  Oscar nominations? Absolutely! A+",Null,1,2,24 November 2003
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," It's the Wonderful of Harry Potter...
","A truly engaging film that does applause the achievements of J.K. Rowlings! The storyline is phenomenally creative, yet simple enough to present a lesson of friendship, bravery and love. Truly a lovely and enchanting tale that focuses on good against evil, but without the usual condescending hoopla!   Unique in every aspect that will touch any child's imagination, bewildering them with a touch of Tom Brown School Days, Oliver Twist; and even Christmas Carol.  What makes a better story for children than a tale about an abused young orphan who gradually finds out that he has a lot to offer to his precious world?  Sure, this movie may not have the jaw-dropping appeal, craved by some.  But the GCI effects play well to pump up great charm, mystery, and bountiful of fun.  Watching the Quidditch match and the host of owls sweeping through the dining room is already worth the price of the tix!  The interior of Hogwart School is so unbelievably extravagant, from the dining room to the staircase and then to the common room.  I was simply mesmerized.  And Daniel Radcliffe is a welcomed Harry Potter. This young actor speaks with his eyes, and not with his gestures, and I love the way the camera focuses on his expressive eyes. He has the image of the sort of kid we would love to have in our home and school!   So idealistically pure, gentle and specialÂ… even in mischief!  My only wish is to see him putting out more gusto with his humor and defiance as the book's Harry.  And the overall cast of actors?  Very delightful, and so true to the book characters!  Little Ron Weasley's performance is tops piping out cool and unexpected humor during the most insignificant times.  And Alan Rickman as Professor Snape: this guy actually sends chills down my spine!  Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid awesome: better than my image of the book character. And Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagall strict, yet with a heart of gold! Yep, lots of actors in an amazing line-up of extraordinary portraitures! Thumbs up to Chris Columbus he certainly has the knack to grip even a six-year old child's attention.  Sure, there are scary parts, but created with taste for the kids in mind.  It's a fast paced movie that has certainly succeeded in bringing the wonderful world of Harry Potter to the silver screen!  Definitely a must-see movie for every child between the ages of six to fourteen, and for anyone longing for some magical moments in his/her life!",Null,0,0,15 November 2001
Mystic River," It's the echo of karma...
","This is a truly emotionally haunting, complex and disturbing film that seems to want to remind us that violence begets never-ending violence. The happenings seem to conjure up the concept of karma as I follow the lives of the characters, especially as in the case of Sean Penn's Jimmy. Excellent performances from Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon! Their characters  three friends - draw me deep into the analytical observation of their traits, behavior and circumstances. I was kept bouncing between the good and evil of their souls. With this film, Penn has become my No. 1 favorite for the Oscar statuette! I'd be surprised if this film isn't nominated for the Best Adapted Screenplay award. Tim Robins, with his Dave's facial demeanor, grips at my heart. What a perfect actor for the Dave role! Marcia Gay Hayden's performance credibly becomes the solid bridge between the incredible depth of interaction between the Dave and Jimmy characters. The story flows wonderfully on screen and stays true and loyal to Dennis Lehane's novel of the same title.  Is the film drawing a fine line between revenge and the psychological weight of suffering? Should I be wondering who is purportedly the real victim of the story? Should I be looking at the rippling effects of guilt that never seem to leave the victim(s)? Under the brilliant direction of Clint Eastwood and the remarkably superb performances of the whole cast ensemble, the awful truth about twisted and profound human psyches develop beautifully, layer by layer. I was literally holding my breath, puffing out soft gasps at intervals, as I followed each character and each event. Yep, this film is filled with exceedingly touching elements. A real tough and phenomenally intense movie to watch! Eastwood has given the audience a very dark film in which every actor delivers an essentially awesome part to make the whole soulful and captivating. I choked with grief as the final tragic twist unfolds  exactly as how I had choked when I finished reading the novel.  It's an unforgettable film. I'd be surprised if I don't get to see the names of Eastwood, Penn, Robbins and Hayden in the coming Oscar nominations. Hhhmh, I'd say it's one of the best adapted screenplay made into an artistically marvelous onscreen masterpiece!     A+",Null,2,5,9 October 2003
Love Actually," Love as defined in many, many forms...
","Love is actually all around you', as the lyrics keep bursting out through many lips and channels.  How true! Yep, this film brings out the concept of what, when and how love exists - in all walks of life. Richard Curtis' love comes in many forms. He also highlights the human goodness in people during crucial times. At the beginning a voice reminds the audience of the love and support given in response to the most devastating of 9/11. The abstractness of love is best captured with the first airport scene and at finale  people, just people, from all walks of life and ethnicity in their acts of love  basically undeterminable love or friendship. The film also suggests that those willing to travel far can find love. Love flourishes in office and work environment, in community gathering, and even at snobbish No. 10 Downing Street. People find love  from strangers, from co-workers, from classmates, between different living classes of individuals, between family members and from different backgrounds. Even language, failing health serves no barrier. It's like getting a learning lesson on love without the concepts being pushed forward in a condescending fashion. With constant repeats of the lyrics of 'Love Is All Around', this film is fun-filled with characters portrayed by a lovely cast of stellar actors. Each in their unique way allows the audience to look at love in different variations - silent love, body-language love, parental love; foolish love; puppy love, a love fling; friendship, companionship, forgiving love, infatuation, et. al. It's, in reality, just the sort of movie the world needs right now.  Hugh Grant clowns his way through this film to offer some very funny moments.  He actually boogies away at No. 10! Who says a nation's leader couldn't juggle entertainment talent with his official duties? If he should choose to make a political statement, blurting out the British virtues to Billy Bob Thorton's over-bearing US president for bullying Britain, can't we at least take the humor with a little giggle? Colin Firth is immaculately stunning in his role. Laura Linney and Emma Thompson bring nice touching sides to their love story. Bill Nighy's cranky and senescent character is incredibly corny.  The two scenarios, given by Rowan Atkinson's character, drives home the idea that the intentions of a Good Samaritan can often be weighed as positive or negative.    Treated in a portmanteau fashion, this film carries nine sets of loosely linked characters and storylines cutting back and forth five weeks before Christmas (ah, the day to celebrate love and forgiveness?)
A very entertaining film with a fabulous insight to the meaning of love...My rating: A",Null,0,2,20 October 2003
There Will Be Blood," Obseesion for wealth, power and control can destroy a person's real purpose for existing...
","Wealth can destroy a human being's real purpose for existing An incredible masterpiece! Writer/Director Anderson does offer a good insight to approximately the first third of Sinclair's novel, drawing on the viewers' attention to the history of oil drilling, prospecting and oil speculation of the industry's early years. Using a darker approach for defining the times and for his characters' portrayals, he subjects his audience to reflect on the disastrous effects of capitalism and evangelism on the obsessed. Set in 4 phases of time frame  namely 1898, 1902, 1911 and 1927 - the elemental themes of greed, ambition, power, deceit and betrayal, and in a strange and subtle presentation, of adoptive parenting, flow gradually and solidly through the film to expose the declining morals of the characters visually generated through the superb performances of the cast members.Money being the root of all evil seems to be the driving force behind this film's story and the viewers get to see how money leads to men's obsessive hunger to control and corrupts souls. Long distance traveling, as this film implies, proves not to be an obstacle for those lusting for it. And human greed for larger wealth and control can turn the obsessed into discontented and irresponsible brutal and insane beings. Does the film's title speak of the blood spill from the dangers of oil mining, or of the oil gushing out like blood from veins, or of blood-ties, or of the real blood oozing out of a dead corpse, or even of the Blood of Christ? Whatsoever it appears to be referencing to does indeed reach its most dramatic climax with the film's most astounding three-word last line that could easily apply to all the victims of their self-made fate.This film does offer an amazing study of an assortment of interestingly intriguing characters, fabulously performed by a great cast of actors whose every move and presence mesmerizes. Daniel Day-Lewis is stunningly effective in his role as Daniel Plainview moving through scenes like an astoundingly celebrated and skillful Kabuki actor! Just watch his facial expressions and his hobbling gait! Paul Dano is just as convincing in his role, first as the mysterious capitalistic Paul, and then as the radical freak, Eli. Whether it's Plainview, Paul or Eli, one will get to listen to the farces they can pull with their gift of the gab and their salesman talk and deceit! Boy, did I cheer for the one who loses his hearing yep, he sure is saved from having to listen to all the deceitful spin.The stylized cinematic appeal gushes with brilliantly austere and breathless takes, successfully combining the best cinematic aesthetics with thought-provoking content while Jonny Greenwood's soundtracks  string heavy and so intense - pound and creep against the background to provide some uncanny haunting moments. The first 20 minutes of this film's almost dialogue-free introductive collaboration is so dramatically surreal and emotionally gripping. It's the finest and most original piece of art direction I've seen! At the age of 37, P.T. Anderson has proved himself to be a phenomenal filmmaker in the class of the likes of Robert Altman, Martin Scorsese, Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, D.W. Griffith and John Ford! And this film is a testimony to what it means by a genuinely powerful and excellent masterpiece of film-making art and craftsmanship.",10,4,16,1 January 2008
Vanilla Sky," Knick, Knack, Paddy Whack, Leave 'Abres Los Ojos' Alone...
","SPOILERS... BEWARE! `Open your eyes' and you still won't get the picture! Yep, this movie is filled with sequences of flip-flop scenes that seem to direct you to a point of never-never-land.  Yep, the flashbacks are so frequent, and so amateurishly integrated, that they can be rather annoying. The dialogue hints, at the very beginning, might prompt the viewers to consider the `differences between dreams and reality,' yet, everything about this flick lacks emotion, energy, and sensibility.  Cameron Diaz's appearance is far too brief to be accredited with good performance.  She is wasting her talent with her Julie role!  Cruise's David lacks the flamboyance of his old style of acting; ducking in and out of his disenchanting dis-figured dullard images.  Diaz's Sophia looks so completely superficial to even sustain the viewers' curiosity.  Half the time, she recites her speech in monotone, subjecting her dialogue to appear clearly irrelevant!  And Jason Lee's Brian lacks personality and depth.  The only credible character is Russell's McCabe, but the camera fails to support his acting skills by shifting its focus onto David so consistently.  Other cast members swing unimpressively in and out of scenes only to raise questions on the purpose of their presence.  Absolutely flat performances overall! Even the bedroom scenes are shallow and without any artistic flare.  This movie does little to heave up emotions, angst, intrigue, or suspense, subjecting the viewers' to lose total interest after about twenty minutes into it.  The viewers will be smitten with restlessness and would, in all likelihood, focus their attention on the colorful objects and physical setups in the background than on the characters.  Undoubtedly, Cameron Crowe has a flare for selecting the familiar song scores and these are more melodramatic than the plot's events and characters.  Unfortunately, his favorable scores won't save this movie. The plot holds some very interesting aspects, but they are completely overshadowed by the actors' weak performances, and by the way the film is directed.  This movie is flooded with so many flaws that it deserves nothing more than a D- rating!",Null,0,0,11 December 2001
Signs," Signs of suspense, fear, and the unkown... trust me they exist!
","Gosh, what a phenomenally creepy thriller! It starts with James Newton Howard's music extravaganza, followed by a bedroom scene with Mel Gibson's Graham Hess character.  The edginess, suspense and horror never seem to cease from there onwards. until the very end!  Oh yes, there are plenty of unavoidable shock waves that will keep the viewers awake and intriguingly attentive!Believe me, this film is proof of what an incredibly fabulous and brilliant storyteller and director M. Night Shyamalan is!  He never fails to allow every one of his characters to push the viewers through their journey of utter fear and suspense, in the hope of defining what's amiss and solving the mystery. Oh yeah, Shyamalan's application of the supernatural does exist here, as with his previous films. Oh yeah, he sure can make a family's home far from being their safe haven. And he sure does know how to introduce the voice of the media to keep the family in touch with the outsiders! The viewers will find themselves interacting non-stop with every character in the story.  There's no way the viewers would want to blink their eyes. at least not with this film, for fear they'd be missing out something. That's how powerful this film is.A talented cast for a brilliant plot.  It does not matter whether it's Graham Hess or his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), or even his children, Morgan and Bo (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin) you're watching. And I do enjoy watching the Merrill character as he does pump up that uncanny intrigue to his presence with the family. Yep, all the characters will keep the viewers completely tensed and fearful, one way or another, in anticipation of the unknown. Watch out!  Shyamalan is not only making his Hitchcockian-style cameo appearances, this talented guy actually holds an acting role that is truly relevant to the sub-plots! Man, oh man, his appearances are a real treat to his fans!  Overall, all the actors' performances do give credibility to their characters. Truly great facial expressions from all, especially with those provided by young Abigail Breslin! Gosh, just watch her incredible eyes!James Newton Howard's music soundtrack is a real treasure.  It creates tension before and within each scope of events. Tak Fujimoto's cinematography is beyond words of description, except for `Wow, wow, wow, oh WOW!'  My mind was totally filled with awe as I observed the stretches of lush cornfields. And these takes almost made me lose sight of the momentary humor that comes with the characters' acts. Oh yes, the humor is clearly needed as a relief from the continuous development of crouching suspense and fear. Even the episode nearing the end of the story will succumb the viewers to a further climatic and edgy appeal. Just stay on top with your hearing. You'll probably grasp like I did at the finale, and might even be led to say `gosh, how appropriate!'Call this movie a science fiction, or a mystery, or even a tale about faith, if you wish, but this film is bound to psychologically plague the viewers' boggling minds with a need to search for clues to the characters' questions at every change of frame. A great masterpiece of mystery and apprehension! Even the film's editing is flawlessly excellent, no matter how utterly chaotic the scenes may be!  This amazing film puts the viewers right in the heart of every scene, all the way through it. Oh yes, I'm definitely seeing it again. Oh yes, I'm definitely adding its DVD to my movie collection!",Null,0,2,28 July 2002
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," A fairy tale about the 'Faerie Queene'? I love it!
","Another Elizabeth I film? Why not? The Elizabethan Era's, indeed, a fascinating periods in English history - an era when England was relatively well off compared to other nations  even if its wealth was unevenly distributed! Director Kapur interestingly puts dramatic and chilling appeal and emphasis on Elizabeth's Golden Age to reveal her personality and struggles to keep her throne and save her country from falling into the hands of conspirators and invaders. Does he give his audience any insight into the Golden Age when English Literature, poetry, music, theater, architecture, scientific and technological advancement, and exploration expansion flourished? Nope. His film does offer some interesting hints that women did enjoy the freedom of movement (ah ha, even a queen's closest and dearest lady-in-waiting could play cuckold to her mistress' favorite man!) and that competing interests and ambitions of colonial powers made it easy for ambitious sailors to legalize acts of piracy! Serious crimes could well resort in severe tortures. Director Kapur does stress that she was the 'peoples' queen!The story continues from where Cate Blanchett's young, flighty, and reckless Elizabeth made her finale masculine-like entrance in the prequel, 'Elizabeth', as the Virgin Queen with her face heavily laced with the 'white-as-milke' make-up - an image of a queen ready to lead her citizens.At a deliberate slow pacing, the introduction with its scenes, characters and their dialog prepare the audience to receive Elizabeth as the Queen with a more focused, more rigid personality, in charge of hers and her country's destinies. Yep, a woman with ready suitors, but offering a sense that she is wedded to her Empire! She seems very philosophical in her ideals and yet we see her court filled with sorts of political characters. Elizabeth, then, is seen with roving eyes, easily distracted by the presence of attractive men. Indeed, it's a crafty way to introduce Elizabeth before Director Kapur plunges his audience into a compelling tale of treachery, assassination attempts and romance that affects the Virgin Queen during her reign. The film carries a mix of intriguing historical facts, legends and myths in ways that one can only expect history teachers of English public schools to apply to make their lessons interesting, or hear from gossipy English peers, from history classes, wanting to impress their friends with stranger-than-fiction tidbits and hearsay of those times. This film does promise a refreshing tale to grasp! There are those tongue-in-cheek whims and antics that mischievously provoke thoughts of the political and religious changing tides of modern times. Director Kapur has certainly avoided the creation of a history epic, based on dull, dry substance! Blanchett is magnificent in her strange, enigmatic and multi-dimensional character, constantly faced with the challenges of her foes plotting and counter-plotting to take her down at her Court, in her government, and, from foreign lands. She's seen as almost as a brutal ruler at times and on her consistent guard in her determination to hold on to her throne, alternating between her seemingly vicious whims, her heroism and tangled romantic emotions! Yet, she comes off gracefully as a person who has the heart to forgive. Oh yes, there's also that scene that prompts me to think of Joan of Arc! It's not hard to want to cheer for the Queen in her determination to fight against the religious intolerance, barbarism and fundamentalism of the Spanish Inquisition. Spain was a very powerful Catholic foe and the Church did try to destroy this Protestant Queen and to restore England back to Catholism! The battle in the calm-to-storm scene is exhilarating to watch. We also witness her struggles in her attempt to balance her duties to her country and her vulnerability to infatuation and tempestuous relationship. Clive Owens superbly handles his role as the dashing Walter Raleigh  indeed, one of the most colorful and controversial character of the times and of whom English history has spun numerous tales about. This film also charts Raleigh's colonizing dreams, his involvement in a love triangle, his sweeping in and out of the Queen's favor and his immense dislike for Catholics - that did historically determine his fate beyond this film's exposure. Geoffrey Rush returns as the loyal and polished spy master, Sir Walsingham and historically seen as the man who attracted conspiracy theories. Hhhmh, was he responsible for the birth of modern espionage? He's truly fascinating to watch. This film has a great stellar cast of actors who don't disappoint. There's so much on-screen chemistry oozing out between characters in this film. Oh yes, the villains are so agitating and annoying to the core. The background music soundtracks come across as dramatically bold and nail-biting, poignant at times, and emotionally mystifying at others- appropriately matching the many guises, moods and whims of the Virgin Queen  the cold and strong and always majestic personality vs .her sentimentally vulnerable images - and also effectively reinforce the moments of gripping horrors of the events witnessed or felt. The sounds do have an interesting mix. Some of the scenes really deliver visual cinematic effects that remind me of the paintings of the period. The somber settings work beautifully to support and give intensity to the horrifying scenes and moments. Just love the way the sets and backgrounds are crafted to avoid overshadowing the characters. Oh yes, I love the color schemes presented in this movie to bring credibility to the scenes! The naval battle and Sir Walters' underwater escapade are so fabulously and stunningly crafted - without going over-the-board with extreme flashy special effects and colors to highlight the events. I was captivated from beginning to end. Oh yes, this film does entertain, sending me on a delightfully exciting spell-bound journey in my attempt to separate legend and myths from historical facts. Oh yes, this film will make English history fun to browse all over again. Yep, I was absolutely entertained!!!",9,145,230,10 October 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Girlish behavior and tantrums override the wisdom of the hobbits...
","Sure, this is one huge CGI swamped extravaganza that succeeds in hosing in as much emotional scenes for all the characters. Very ambitious treatment by Director Peter Jackson, no doubt, but is it the best on my list? Absolutely no.  This film is so heavily hoisted up with too much of chronological shuffles from Tolkien's book that moments, I had felt from the books, can't be pinned down as beautifully from this last film.  Essentially, ROTK is over whelming and too congested. Besides, Jackson has taken too much liberties on the characters changes as well, it would be a short coming for anyone to believe that he/she is well versed with Tolkien's works by basically watching the film.Is Tolkien supposed to show the hobbits are childish rather than childlike by nature? Take a look at Samwise's treatment of Gollum and his interactions with Frodo.  Sadly, Sam, at times, comes through as a kid throwing tantrums. I can't understand his tearful emotions at the most precious moments when he is supposed to be the guiding light of strength and courage. Frankly, the tears of Sam and his howling are inclined to show the weakness of his soul than pump up the illusion that Sam shines and actually becomes the important player in the 'bearer of the ring' analysis. Sam's character fails for me. His mental wisdom fails to come through on screen. It's Tolkien's wise choice to put the safe keeping of the ring, in not one hobbit, but four. Jackson is not portraying the developing wisdom (that produces the internal courage and strength of the hobbits versus the brawn of the other Fellowship members.)Of course, the scene with the tears to show that 'parting is such sweet sorrow' scene is fine. But, overall the tear-jerking false endings only suggests that Jackson is very hesitant to declare 'ciao' to his troupe of 'beauties.'  The boat pulling out of the shores scene is cheesy. Are the background landscapes of 'temples' meaning to suggest a mighty, classically Greek poetic departure? Truthfully, the scene makes me think more of a lovely angel leading a horde of fairies to heaven. How do I assess the behaviors of the hobbits to one another?  They do create insinuations of male fellows who are physically as well as mentally attracted to one another. Is this part of Tolkien's ploy, or just Jackson's? Why is Denethor's role so simplified? Wasn't we supposed to recognize a noble man's falling out of grace rather than see him come through the screen as the villain's villain? I felt that too much concentration has been placed on the development of characters that can be put out into the commercialized toy markets, that Jackson has sacrificed his directing talents on this film's villains. Leaving Saruman and Wormtounge out of the film does Tolkien's book no justice. After all, Tolkien readers shouldn't be cheering for Jackson's intention to show that real wars belong only in battlefields and forget that wars can come as close to the Hobbits' homeland without the visual destruction of Saruman and his evil advisor.  As for Faramir's love for Eowyn - Jackson seems to flip-flop with their interactions.
Of course, any film's inclusion of humor is appreciated.  But to humor the audience at the expense and ridicule of Tolkien's little fellows does contradict the author's need to show them as the wise little creatures. Of course, I'm fine with Gimli giving the audience some humorous dialogue that is not befitting his book character. As a film over pouring with substances, I can't help but feel that the most scenes are rushed. Even the battles seem to bring sense to the alarming moments for the audience. Slip and slap cuts and hurried blurry swipes between crucial battling interactions of characters in so many battle regions don't play well with my eyes! Plenty of crushing and slaughtering to sustain the audience's excitement!  A good promotion of CGI special effects skills, of course!  Oh yes, Jackson takes a lot of liberties towards the film's end and he has forgotten the devastation to the forested land as one of the vital results of war. By leaving the Ents out of the picture does not create this impression! I want to see the Sam sowing the seed, rather than shuffling his new family into his cool little cottage home!Jackson, nevertheless, succeeds with his 'dark' scenes. There are moments when the characters do force me to look at them closer. His Gollum is precious, but Gollum does tend to come through more as Jackson's principle character than the title's King, or even the true bearer of the ring. It's cool to see the real image of Andy Serkis in this film. I do like Jackson's way of treating the flashback story of the Smeagol/Gollum character. Miranda's Eowyn shines for the sake of giving the female audience pride to understand the importance of a woman's role in the battlefront.  Overall, I felt that friendship and loyalty fashioned out in this film is rather confusing to define in Jackson's version.  Almost as if they are sculptured to the individual's own judgment and pleasure!Does this film live up to my expectations?  In terms of the flashes of familiar characters to promote the toy market, I'd say yes. Special GCI effects to raise the blood pressure? Yes. The character development? Too much liberties taken by Jackson to stress that no one should watch his version without reading the book.  The events? If only he'd not decided to fill this film with the events that should have been in his previous films. It's a good film to watch, considering it to be Jackson's version. A good film not to be missed, but it's not my best film seen this year.

Hart's War," Keeping honor alive?
","MINOR SPOILERS... BEWARE!It's not often we get to watch a movie where a POW confine consists of such varied mind camps. Irrational mindsets perhaps, but credible! It's not a movie about romantic or gung-ho patriotism, nor is it about national victory. It's not even about the bonds of combat soldiers, or the foolish waste of valuable lives! Hart's War, clearly a `pun' play on the movie title, probes into the segregated cast, cultural and racial prejudices of Stalag 7A characters, as witnessed by a young lieutenant and former law student, seized and thrown into a Nazi POW camp. It examines a person's decision to accommodate one man's needs over a group's. And it brings to light the importance and proper definition of `honor.'A well thought script, with powerful dialogue, that has kept me totally focused on the screen. The cinematic settings of dreary blue nuances and effective array of pyrotechnics, throughout the film, are coherent to the moods of conspiracy and chilling conflicts. Even the bouts of occasional humor seem necessary to provide momentary relief to the shady, intense and gripping circumstances.  Definitely a powerful drama that is visually attentive to heroism and sacrifice, honor and betrayal!
This movie is a brilliant capture of a man's conscience and struggle to choose between his morality, his duty to his country, and his life. And it's a sophisticated and compelling tale that doesn't employ judgmentally empathetic imagination. Colin Farrell is superb in his role as the youthful Lt. Tom Hart. Will he become Hollywood's hottest property after this film? I should think so! In fact, the overall ensemble of actors is a fabulous choice for the electrifying roles, each given character with his personal motivation and individual perspective to make the plot work very well. A murder mystery with a racial twist that leads to a court trial under the rules of the Geneva Convention, only to expose the ethics, purposes and hidden agendas of all the characters in a multi-layered plot!  Intriguing, intelligent and definitely mesmerizing! But will the Germans have their last laugh, thinking that their American POWs are backstabbing each other? This film is certainly a must-see to get to the answer.",Null,0,0,12 February 2002
Gangs of New York," It's a mesmerizing New York epic told in the best of filmmaking skills...
","This film presents a combination of what makes a great film truly tick! Solid depth, non-confusing battle' scenes, wonderful cast of characters, great cinematography, and more important, a fabulous narration style that makes sense! And the flow of events is of a pacing that is commendable for supporting the character development and for telling the story.
There are loads of violent takes... but hey, isn't this film supposed to reveal the events of that era's New York City streets?  Aren't they supposed to be the pivotal points of the story?  Surely, Scorsese does not mean to bombard the viewers with explosively visual imagination purely to stifle or shock one's nerves. The violence is actually splattered in Herbert Asbury's book of the same title! Amazing feat, I'm still awed by how Scorsese could condense such a thick book into a film and still maintains a true sense of the New York City of the 19th Century that was infested with so many corrupted gangs and tribes. What one sees is a chaotic urban city, not crowded by vehicles or building structures, but by human beings, fighting for power and running amok!  This movie succeeds as a history lesson about New York City in its infancy stage.  The flavor of its multi-cultures is well portrayed.  The gist of Asbury's book is superbly treated. The development of the characters is well maintained. The themes of loyalty and vengeance flush out strongly in this film. Even the sub-plots are admirably introduced, almost as if they are the necessary spices added to enrich the main plot. Combined, they offer an in-depth understanding of the moods, the morals and the politics of New York in those days.     
A great cast of actors to captivate the audience!  I actually didn't recognize Liam Neeson in his Father Vellon role. Daniel Day Lewis gives an incredible `butcher' performance... moving from a younger looking Billy, the leader of the Native Americans, to his `Butcher' - 16 years down the road. I thought the young lad who plays the little boy, Amsterdam, is a great choice. Try comparing his facial expressions with Leonardo DiCaprio's adult Amsterdam, and you'll know what I mean. I am not big on Dicaprio, but I really thought he does very well in presenting his character. Cameron Diaz is truly mesmerizing; she commands the viewers' attention, even if her role plunges into the story's sub-plots.  There's great chemistry between her character and DiCaprio's. With Jim Broadbent's portrayal as the corrupt Mayor Tweed here, plus his corrupt Wackford Squeers in Nicholas Nickleby, I'd say he's incredibly apt to take on any villain' roles of the earlier centuries.  The dialogue works well with every character, leading the audience into the insights of historical events. The use of flashbacks is brilliantly done  it serves its phenomenal purpose of exposing the characters' feelings during those moments as well as spurring up recall-reflexes to account for the characters' past positions. 
The cinematic effects are astounding, never leaving the viewers with the feel of pretentious aestheticism. Instead, it allows the viewers to relive history in a manner that appears genuine. Take any of the riots' or fight' scenes, for instance, I couldn't bring myself to denounce the existence of those events.  They look too real on screen to lack historical credibility. Watching those New York residents wielding their kitchen knives did leave me cold with fear. That's how awesomely realistic this movie is for me.  
John Carpenter's scores are so, so cool too! They actually cause my heart to beat dramatically in sync with them.  This film is absolutely powerful and spectacular, the story folding beautifully with the characters.

Windtalkers," The code that was key to winning the war
","Some may dictate that the contents of today's war movies are either too harsh or predictable these days.  But are such movies still worth seeing? Of course! If war history is taken at its face value, surely the contents will be predictable and harsh. For me, watching Windtalkers is like re-living history, and Director John Woo has done a marvelous job without robbing me of the horrific woe of wars and the important facts that wrap around the unsung story of the Navaho code-talkers. No doubt I was petrified by the visuals, but I can't pretend that terror is glamorous and that war is glorious.Director Woo has done a superb job in showing that there's no romance when it comes to war, especially with the battle at Saipan! Yep, downright nothing in this film to indicate the pretentious sweet smell of success, as far as the inhumanity of war is concerned! This film definitely grabs me cold, and it's my wake-up call to how vital and relevant the Navaho code had been to us during W.W. II.  It sucks me into every scene and makes me feel for every character (and I stress the word `EVERY'!) in it.The visually graphic scenes of men injured or killed are amazingly real and shocking.  Yep, every bit of the cinematographic effects is beyond words of description and the actors' performances are sheer awesome!  Great explosive music scores that are overwhelmingly in sync with the events and moods! Woo has created a masterpiece with everything flowing and meshing together like a powerful composition of jazz music. I was captivated by the strong emotions that are spattered throughout this spectacular movie. This film has not failed to allow the characters to develop phenomenally, despite the over-powering dramatically chaotic action sequences and special effects. Yep, men-at-war don't necessary loose their human aspects and this film does indeed recognize both their flaws and their virtues. Observing how the men interact is very emotional. This film has a wonderful ensemble of actors who fit well into their roles. Some of the dialogue may appear rather banal at times, but I guess I shouldn't always assume that all men in battle are graduates from some prestigious colleges. And watching Roger Willie and Christian Slater performing their wood flute-harmonica duets is itself worth the regular price of a movie tix!What is unique about this film is that neither the bombastic special effects nor the performances of the characters overshadow a strong and crucial message that has to be delivered!  Watching this movie is like seeing frame after frame of documented historical characters and events as witnessed by a competent war journalist! I was totally stressed out with keeping myself in balance as I tried to keep count of the survivors. A MUST-SEE movie for anyone with a strong stomach to watch credible war-terror combats, or for those with faith that good war films and national patriotism are not synonymously related!  And this war film does capture the truth on screen as how a code was key to our winning the war.  Boy, I came out of the theater, choked with tears and in desperate need for a cup of piping hot cha.
An A+ production, I must admit...",Null,0,0,9 June 2002
Up in the Air," George Clooney charms, mesmerizes... the film is George Clooney!
","Jason Reitman's film is clever, mesmerizing with numerous scenes succeeding in stirring up laughter, and has a host of memorable images of very expressive faces of characters ... at least for only the first 30 minutes before it gradually glides into tediously silly sub-plots. Luckily, the film does have George Clooney to keep the audience's eyes glued to the screen from scene to scene. In the same way Ellen Page's charming presence took over literally every scene in Reitman's Juno, George Clooney is built into every scene to charm the audience. Every other character is merely playing second fiddle to his screen prominence. Clooney is marvelously captivating throughout the film. Indeed, he is the film. Yep, he's the Cary Grant of the 21st century and does deliver style, confidence, elegance, and phenomenal acting talent! Yes, he appears so iconic, immaculate and savvy in his suit! His stylistically, suave and handsome Ryan keeps the audience's eyes glued to the screen, and immensely charmed by Clooney. Clooney is Ryan, and Ryan is Clooney! Everything else, including the out-of-place and silly subplots, like the wedding scenario, and Reitman's awkward cameo scene, becomes secondary. Yep, Clooney holds the responsibility to make or break this film!Vera Farmiga's Alex (at times, reminding me of Leelee Sobieski.) does try hard to steal the limelight from him, but fails. Her character is unconvincing and superficial, her moods and expressions pretty one-dimensional. Her acting performance hasn't changed much since her Madolyn in 'The Departed', The interactions between her and Ryan seem too theatrical even with her flirtatious ploy, and there is no convincing chemistry between the two. It does make me wonder if that is meant to be a hint for predicting the story's ending. Anna Kendrick's Natalie is an oddball, marvelous when exhibiting her peculiar and oft times, bizarre behavior. She is the only character in the film capable of stealing the momentary limelight from Clooney's Ryan. In a strange way, the camera seems to be focusing consistently on her set of teeth, at different angles, to make me wonder if they are meant to arouse laughter, or that they are elements relevant to her performance. Overall, the Natalie character is not very interesting. I doubt I'd miss her if she's written out of the script. Maybe, her character is meant to be there to pose challenges to Ryan's career security? Hard to tell! CLOONEY DOES DESERVE AN Oscar NOMINATION. He is the story; he is the film, and he grabs the viewer's attention from scene to scene, allowing them to overlook any brouhaha, the tedious and slow pacing of events, and the silly subplots with little bearing to the film's initial 30 minutes of plot and themes. I was very glad for the film's ending before Clooney's Ryan starts to lose his complete poise and savvy disposition, and sinks to the same silliness exhibited by Natalie. Clooney is fabulous; the film/storyline, overall, is mediocre.",6,4,16,4 December 2009
