Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Disappointing eye-candy, hype-fueled mess
","Star Wars, the Phantom Menace, is perhaps one of the most disappointing movies of all time, but that's not so much the director to blame, but also the fact we all were expecting almost the Second Coming, and then, all we got was just a mediocre movie, with boring characters, boring story, and a bunch of eye-candy. George Lucas should have known that special effects without a good story aren't impressive anymore. In the seventies, watching 'Star Wars', the 'fairy tale in space with cool effects' was ground breaking, because it mixed a recognizable story 'peasant saves the princess and becomes a knight' with a creative environment. But in the 90s, watching 'a pointless tale with computer effects' was just boring.This movie isn't the 'worst movie ever made', but it's just boring: it hasn't any endurable or classic value as the original trilogy. The characters are undeveloped or just annoying (and borderline racist), the story is a pseudo-political fiasco with boring dialog ('but the fans won't accept these are movies for kids!', yeah, kids are eager to watch arguments about taxes, trade federations, bureaucracy, etc.), which sums up the dullness of the movie. George Lucas is telling us: take my eye-candy, and buy tickets and props, you mindless drones.Of course, fan-boys who like this movie will try to justify everything: 'The plot DOES make sense', 'the story DOES make sense', 'Lucas had it all planned from the beginning', guess what: all the explanations and justifications won't make this movie more entertaining. 3/10",3,6,11,19 March 2011
Star Trek," Reboot successful
","At last, after more of ten years, a DECENT Star Trek movie. The 'TNG' ones were pretty lame, and the 'TOS' ones were a mixed bag. Then, we came to this one, which, by Sci-Fi-Fantasy standards, it's pretty good!.Of course, the main criticisms of this movie will come from Trek fanboys, angry because 'they raped our beloved characters' or comments such as these. Nonsense. By prequels standards, this movie is a respectful and well crafted nod to a cheesy TV series of the 60s. And, yeah, the 'timeline erase' issue. All I can say is: if this movie has saved the Star Trek Universe of movies such as The Final Frontier, Generations and Nemesis, then, deserves praise just for that.The main problem I found in this movie, is that some plot devices just defy all credibility. (SPOILERS!) So, Kirk lands in some ice planet, ejected by stupid Spock, only to find elder Spock (good to see you, Mr. Nimoy) just a couple miles around, who coincidently has the explanation about the plot. Oh, and Scotty is around there also. That's convenient. And there's more of these.But aside that, the story is just fine. The acting is intense and excellent, the effects are good, the tone is adventurous, and, overall, it's a good cinematic experience. Check it out.9/10",9,0,1,9 April 2011
Thor: Ragnarok," This is what a superhero movie is all about!
","Thor: Ragnarok is an incredible experience. Right from the start, you chuckle with all the gags and it's clear that the movie is playing itself for laughs for the most part. But, and this is the key factor in the movie, when things are serious, the movie is completely serious and poignant. This creates a consistent and really marvelous cinematic experience, and the best part, it's for all the family to see. As a really good superheroes movies really should be. Superheroes movies, at heart, are about fun, doing the right thing and having good times. The movie has been lauded by all the critics and spectators, and really deserves all the praise. A movie experience completely recommended. Perhaps the finest effort so far in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and gives hope to continue in this trend, and I hope all the other 'cinematic universes' take this lesson at heart: it's not about the shared story, it's about the characters, the adventure and, specially, the fun.10/10, completely.",10,6,26,16 February 2018
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Sort of a let-down, but a fitting ending for the Star Wars saga.
","And the Star Wars saga ends, with 'Return of the Jedi', a good, but flawed, movie, which was sort of a let-down for many fans, and is considered, almost universally, the weakest movie of this Original Trilogy.The main problem is the tone: it feels like Lucas was scared that the last movie was 'so adult' or 'so dark', so he tried to recapture some of the charming feel of the original Star Wars... but this was not made with a light and funny story, rather by recycling plot-devices from the first movie (Destroy the Death Star... again), and adding kid-friendly stuff: the poor Imperial Stormtroopers have become the laughing-stock of nerd-culture, for being defeated by a bunch of Teddy-Bears from the forest. So, a lot of the seriousness achieved by the last movie is lost in this one.Also, it's clear that this movie won't take any risk: the cliffhanger left in the last movie is resolved almost immediately, and at the end, everything turns out fine (spoilers!): everyone survives, Darth Vader becomes good at the end, and the Empire is utterly defeated. The most dramatic thing in the movie was the scene of the death of an Ewok. There is suspense in the movie, but it's resolved almost immediately. The best part in the movie is the climatic Emperor-Vader-Luke confrontation, which resolves the plot-threads left by 'Empire' in a fitting way. But the rest of the subplots in the movie are less dramatic and more light: not a problem per se, but the tone-shifts gives this movie a weird feel sometimes.All the above criticisms come from the perspective of the tone established in 'Empire'. But if we consider this movie not a 'Space-Drama' but a 'Space Adventure for kids', then it's a great movie, perhaps reflecting the fact of Lucas adopting a child during that time. It's funny, intense and the story is good enough to entertain everyone: the kids will enjoy the 'kiddie stuff', and the adults will laugh and enjoy the adventures of their beloved characters and the happy ending.So, in conclusion, a good, but not excellent, ending for one of the most creative sagas of the 70s and the 80s. These movies are true classics, and a monument to George Lucas' creativity, and the team which worked with him.8/10",8,0,1,21 March 2011
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Eye-candy for everyone!
","Perhaps Lucas thought that the problem with 'The Phantom Menace' was Jar Jar Binks: nope, it was the fact the movie hadn't a good story or good characters. But, in this movie, all he did was just remove Jar Jar from the equation. And then he gave us pretty much the same thing again: lame story, boring characters, but all covered up in drool inducing eye-candy.The story this time is a little more interesting: (minor spoilers!) the whole 'Clone Army' stuff is a fair mystery, but the lack of resolution of this plot makes it, you guessed it, entirely pointless. At the end, clones are there just to fill up a phrase said by Luke Skywalker in Star Wars, and the battles between droids and clones are completely devoid of any emotional value: what's on the stake here?, droids or manufactured people?. It's just boring.But the worst part is the character of Anakin Skywalker. In the last movie he was a 'goodie-goodie', but now is an annoying and whiny character, who lives complaining about everything, and goes on killing rampages when angry. If Lucas was trying to make these movies around 'the Tragedy of Darth Vader', the first basic step is to make your protagonist a likable character, or at least, an anti-hero with a 'fatal flaw', not a whiny, angry and annoying brat: tragedy comes from the empathy generated by the character, and suffering alongside him. The character of Anakin is so lousy, it's almost impossible to sympathize with him.The movie has so dull sequences that it's almost unbearable: the 'love' scenes are so stupid, it's unbelievable to think that the guy who wrote them was also the creator of 'Star Wars'. The action sequences are OK, I guess, but without a good story, it's just boring eye-candy. And Yoda goes on a light-saber battle, in a sequence so ridiculous, he almost looks like Speedy Gonzalez.To conclude: Lucas didn't learn. The problem was not poor Jar Jar, the comic relief who couldn't make it: the problem was the lack of story.3/10",3,2,5,20 March 2011
Justice League," What a mess
","Justice League is a movie with a serious identity crisis. The movie is not sure about what it is, and goes all around the place. It has good moments and some good one-liners, but all in all, is a garbled mess of different tones, plots and characters which aren't developed, and gets really annoying at times. Batman v Superman was also a mess, but at least it was consistent with itself. This goes all over the place.The good: Supes' return. It was emotional and powerful. He stole the movie, and the interpretation by Cavill is really, really good. It felt more like Superman than any other movie.The bad: It's rushed beyond belief. Too many characters, not enough time to develop them. The main antagonist was the most affected by this.Sorry to say, but this movie is not that good. It's not bad either. It's just mediocre.5/10",5,3,6,15 February 2018
The Matrix Revolutions," Yes, the emperor was naked
","So, it ends the dubious 'saga' of Matrix, which began as a sci-fi collage in the late 90s, to become this mess of exhausting visual effects and characters which used to work back then, but by the time of this movie, are just annoying brats dressed as emos. But, let's stop complaining, and on to the review (some spoilers ahead).Remember the cliffhanger which made all the nerds in the Internet to make up incredible and, sometimes, rather creative theories and explanations?, well, all the thing was just Neo trapped in a train station by the Gyro Captain of Mad Max 2. Yes. That was it. And this leads to yet another boring confrontation with the french dude from the last movie, which concludes with... Neo being freed. What's the impact of this subplot in the main story?. None. But it was a good way to resolve the cheap cliffhanger left by the last movie... good in monetary sense, I mean: it made all the fan boys return to watch the movie.But, alas, then we have the actual plot of the movie, which is so stupid, it's hard to believe. Neo now wants to go to the 'source'. Why?, he doesn't know, but he goes anyway. The rest return to Zion, and we have to watch a battle sequence so boring, it's almost incredible: the characters in that sequence aren't developed at all. Why must we care for these guys?, good question.So, long story short, Neo goes to the source. He's blind now, but he 'sees everything', because now it's time to rip off Dune, I guess. Trinity dies, he goes inside a city of machines, talks to a machine, he's plugged into some machine, and then he fights Agent Smith, which is ultra powerful now, for some reason. In the end, he's the victor, of sorts, and the machines stop their attack against Zion and retreat, leaving mankind still mostly enslaved by the machines, and living in a hole in the ground, but everyone is happy: Morpheus is crying of happiness, so I guess we must be happy also.This movie is so stupid and pretentious, it becomes unbearable to watch. For example, the 'I do this and that for LOVE' is a recurrent theme, repeated by almost every character of the movie; yeah... that's subtle. You know what's another thing you can do to make it even more subtle?, maybe NOT MAKING EACH CHARACTER ON THE MOVIE REPEAT IT.But, at least, this movie had a good thing: it ended. Conclusion?, if you don't have a good story, please, don't make sequels to somewhat successful movies. All the hype, effects and pretentiousness can't replace a good story.3/10",3,9,16,20 March 2011
The Village," Quite effective, but flawed.
","The Village is a drama masquerading as a horror/suspense movie. The premise is simple: A village in mid XVIII century is being terrorized by supernatural agents that surround the village...(spoilers)... except that, of course not. At this time, we all know the drill. The whole thing really is set in modern times, when a group of people used some incredible contrived means to isolate themselves completely from the outside world. Indeed, it sound really forced, and somewhat ridiculous.But, I think reducing the whole thing at a bad twist is making a disservice to the movie. When I watched The Village, the movie felt less like a horror movie, and more like a love and human drama. The relationship between Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix is really well crafted in the movie, and it feels real, and even beautiful. When tragedy struck in the middle of the movie, I was worried less about the whole monster schtick, and more about the plight of the characters. Those were the moments that really carried the movie.But alas, here comes the flaw of the movie. Being this an M. Night Shyamalan movie in midst 2000s, the movie couldn't just be a drama: it needed a 'suspense' and 'horror' theme, which is the weakest angle of the movie, and completely ruined by the 'reveal' I mentioned, which makes everything regarding that angle, completely pointless. It's the same flaw that 'Signs' has: a contrived and unbelievable plot device that belittles and ruins all the suspense.But, I think this movie is superior to Signs, because although The Village plays with the suspense angle, it's far less accentuated than in Signs. I think the same resolution could have been kept, but making the movie less about the 'mystery of the monsters' and more about the personal drama. I think the movie works in the end, but this flaw severly damages it.6/10",6,0,2,8 February 2019
Ghostbusters," The mystery of why this movie is so good
","For me, Ghostbusters is a very special movie. I watched when I was very little, and it has been one of my favorites movie during my whole life. I loved the movie when I was young, and then, when I grew up, it became even better when many jokes and plot points I didn't get as a kid, finally made sense. But the question remains, why this movie is so good?.I think the enduring charm of Ghostbusters is that is a perfect mix of comedy and horror. The movie is a comedy, but it takes itself completely seriously in its absurd premise, so the movie feels completely grounded in reality. It's basically our world, but with real ghosts in it (I think it helps that Dan Aykroid actually believes in all this weird stuff). This makes al the tension in the movie feel real, and the action looks compelling and believable. The effects sometimes have some failures in some animations, but all in all, it looks great, and really spooky.Regarding the comedy, the main point is that the movie is not over-indulgent in its humor. Of course, Bill Murray is the funniest character in the movie, but he is restrained, and, although he's basically a meta-guy of sorts in midst of the ridiculousness of the plot, in the end he is really commited in the action, and gives an excellent performance. He is, of course, the fan-favorite character of the movie, but let's not forget all the rest of the cast, which makes this movie a memorable experience.I think Ghostbusters is perhaps the best comedy of the 80s. I think to further describe it would be redundant. My recomendation is just watch it, and enjoy it.10/10",10,2,2,11 February 2019
Mulholland Drive," A perfect, sad and strange movie
","This movie is, to date, David Lynch's greatest cinematic achievement since 'Eraserhead'. This movie is a deep and complex introspective voyage into the nature of dreams, love, guilt and despair, in a surreal environment which oscillates between frightening and funny, hateful and lovely, strange and sad.This movie can be hard to follow and understand at first glance, but after repeated views, the plot emerges, and it's so simple, yet touching, it becomes one of the best tragedies ever recorded on film. The story of a frustrated woman, searching for answers such as: 'Who am I?', 'What is real?'.A must-see for all David Lynch fans, and for people who enjoy sad mysteries.10/10",10,2,3,26 March 2011
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," An all around good movie, but harmed by some irrelevant sillyness, and endless hype.
","Star Wars, Episode VIII is, all in all, an entertaining adventure, with good action, good performances, but somewhat tainted by some silly scenes and concepts. But, in general, emotionally, it's a movie that works creating interesting relationships between characters (at last, credible sexual tension in Star Wars since 1983!), good landscapes and action scenes, and went to places Star Wars never had gone before, such as the theme of 'dealing with failure'. Yes, it was present in ESB, but in this movie is more developed, perhaps not in a subtle way, but it's not a common theme in adventures.But, it's a flawed movie, and that's undeniable. There's a lot of silly scenes, the humor is sometimes out of place (but it's not as overblown as it has been said), and there are some plot holes which makes the movie a lot more silly than it should be. For me, the worst mistake was, why the Purple Hair Lady didn't told Poe the plan from the very beginning?. There was no reason for she doing otherwise, and that lead to the subplot of Poe-Rose-Finn which is one of the most divisive points of the movie. I think these concepts should have been fixed, but, all in all, it's just minor errors, and don't detract from the emotional core of the movie, which is the relationship between Rey and Kylo, which was tense and it felt real, deep and complicated.So, this is a fine movie, with some minor issues, but it's good fun, which is, in my opinion, the heart of Star Wars: good adventures and escapist fun... so, what's the deal with the vitriolic reaction is receiving?In that respect, this movie is a clear example of an over-hyped product which ends being harmed by all the hype, which, in this movie was centered around all the mysteries created by TFA, such as: 'Rey's mysterious origin story, what's her relationship with Luke, who is Snoke', etc. etc. ad nauseam. And it was like in a roulette, the ball fell in 00. Everyone loses: Rey's fathers are just nobodies, she has no relationship with Luke, Snoke turns out to be completely irrelevant, etc. So, in terms of fan expectations, this movie dared to subvert everyone's expectations. That's dangerous, but also, it's bold, and I have to respect the director for daring to take such a choice. But, I think a lot of the attacks this movie is receiving are a reaction of a hyped fandom, not a fair analysis done by taking the movie for what it is: a silly and fun space adventure for all the family to enjoy.So, I think, it's an all around good movie, and I think it's unfair to say it's bad just because it dared to to subvert expectations. It's not good for that, either, but I think there are enough merits for considering this movie a really good one.8/10",8,1,4,30 January 2018
Rudy," A good movie, but rather manipulative
","Rudy is a great movie. Sean Astin is just great in the role of the underdog fighting for his 'big chance', and at the end, (spoiler alert) guess what?: he just made it!. The movie is so well crafted that when the whole Stadium is cheering for Rudy, we, the audience, are also cheering for him. It's emotional to the core.But, then, after the movie was over, I thought about the actual achievements made by the character, and... I thought it was pretty lame. It was his life dream, I guess, and he fought hard, but at the end it feels more like a 'make-a-wish' story, rather than an 'underdog rising to the challenge' story, as Rocky was. The great achievement of Rudy was not 'rising to the challenge' but rather to make good friends and impress everyone with his effort and his unbreakable will... to just play football in a College Team. It's like a guy dedicating all his life to achieve a childhood fantasy, such as 'going to space', or 'visit Europe': it's nice, but the almost obsessive nature of the dream makes it feel a little weird.And that's precisely the magic of the movie: it turns this 'child fantasy' scenario into a full-blown drama, and it's so well done, that at the end you throw all your cynicism away and you're cheering for the character: fine, but it's also manipulative. I think there are far better examples of stories of people fighting for their dreams and hopes, rather than the story of a guy who 'just wanted to play Football'. But, for what it is, it's an excellent 'feel-good-movie'.8/10",8,0,0,18 March 2011
The Dark Knight," The best comic-book movie ever...
","... since Tim Burton's 'Batman'. No argument here, both movies are masterpieces, and this movie is in a different vein, so, comparisons are unfair to both sides. With that said, on to the review of Chris Nolan's 'Dark Knight'.The only problems I found in this movie are: it's a little pretentious for just being the story of a guy with a bat-suit, and the dialog has some silly stuff here and there... but that's just minor nitpicking, compared with the engaging and emotionally exhausting experience this movie is. This movie is one of those who puts you in the edge of your seat the whole time. The performances are excellent in general, but Ledger's Joker, is brilliant, one of the most frightening characters in the history of cinema. The story has ups, downs, adventure, comedy, drama, tragedy, redemption, sadness... it's incredible. It's like riding in a roller coaster, but with the Joker seated next to you: Funny and frightening. That sums up the movie. Perfect score for this thrilling ride to Mr. Nolan.10/10",10,3,6,26 March 2011
2001: A Space Odyssey," Greatest movie ever.
","This movie is perfect. Absolutely perfect. It's the closest I can think to a 'cinematic experience'. Yeah, in other movies, you're watching the action, in this movie, you are almost experiencing the action, the tension, the odyssey... it's amazing.The story is a mystery plot, in which the viewer has to figure out, along with the characters, what is going on, in midst of a chilling space adventure, in which the characters face a relentless force lurking them... it's incredible. I won't dare spoil anything to anyone, so, go check it out. This movie is the prime example of 'show, don't tell'. It's the most amazing visual experience you'll ever had. I watch it regularly, and the visual effect never get old. Why?, because the experience and the story are so well crafted, it makes the effects amazing every time, not like other movies (as Matrix) where the effects get old after the second view. There are deep questions, deep motifs, and a mysterious and epic finish... it's breath taking.When I think a movie works for me, I give it a 10 score. I wish I could give it more to this masterpiece. The finest hour of the genius of Stanley Kubrick.11/10",10,2,5,20 April 2011
The Happening," Interesting ideas, but falls deep into a sea of ridicule.
","The Happening is a more intelligent movie than it seems. The internet has made this movie into a collective punchline since its premiere in 2008, and deservedly. The tone is incoherent, the acting is numb, the dialog is a complete joke, etc. But, perhaps there is something more about this movie?.(Spoilers)The main theme in this movie is 'the unknowable', and the hubris of thinking you know, when you really don't. The 'plant toxin' idea is initially pitched by a weird random guy, but it's the only explanation Elliot has, so he keeps acting on it, just because he wants to know what is really happening, so he can save himself and his group. In the end, he fails miserably, almost all the people with him ends up dead, and he makes a fool of himself by talking to a plastic plant. The guy is a science teacher, and in the beginning of the movie, he says:'Science will come up with some reason to put in the books, but in the end it'll be just a theory. I mean, we will fail to acknowledge that there are forces at work beyond our understanding. To be a scientist, you must have a respectful awe for the laws of nature.'This is the theme of the movie, and it's a fair point. Some things just can't be explained, M. Night thinks, and, if he wants to make a movie about that, good. In that way, it is a companion piece to 'Signs'. However, this concept is awfully executed. I think the main flaw is that it tried to be at the same time satire and horror, and that put the tone of the movie all over the place, becoming a ridiculous mess, which invites laughter at the movie, rather than reflection on the nature of the unknownable.This movie is kind of a modern Zardoz: a satire lost in ridicule. Although this movie is far less enjoyable because, at least, Zardoz went all the way in its satire and is much bolder in its performance. The Happening is just fun for the memes and the ridicule associated with it, but aside from that it's just a tedious mess.4/10",4,1,1,26 December 2018
The Matrix Reloaded," The saga continues... wait, what saga?
","Matrix: Reloaded, the highly anticipated sequel to 'Matrix', is the prime example of a movie that didn't need to be made, but, it was anyway. The result is just a train-wreck of pretentiousness and visually exhausting sequences which fail to entertain. Yeah, in the first movie the 'slow-mo' sequences were interesting, now it feels like the movie is just ripping itself.What's the problem with this movie?. The Matrix was a rather unoriginal, but fine movie, with some minor issues, such as over-pretentiousness and self-indulgence: Matrix Reloaded is blown out with these problems. The dialog is dull and pretentious, the 'plot' (spoilers!) is a pointless search which is supposed to 'resolve everything' and then, it doesn't... but there's a last minute cliffhanger... That's pretty lame.The main problem with the plot is that Neo isn't a good protagonist anymore. He was fine when he was 'learning to unleash his powers', but now he's a 'super-human', so all the tension surrounding him inside the matrix evaporates: the best 'action' scenes are those in which Neo isn't there, such as the infamous 'highway chase', which ends with, you guessed it, Neo coming and saving everyone. That's the reason why this movie shouldn't have been made. The 'Neo-cycle' was completed and closed in the first movie: the story of a guy being a 'super-human' is not as interesting as the story of a guy becoming a 'super-human', unless you craft a creative story... which the directors just didn't.Why this movie was somewhat well received, then?. I can think in two reasons: 1) The visuals were somewhat impressive 2) Had a cliffhanger at the end... and that's it. I remember that the Internet was swarming with 'theories about the Matrix', after this movie was released: that there's a 'Matrix inside the Matrix', and such. But then, came the next movie... and surprise: the emperor was naked.4/10",4,1,1,20 March 2011
Joker," Great movie by itself. But I have a conceptual criticism about it.
","Joker is a great film. The performances are excellent, and all in all, is well rounded and chilling film. Joaquin Phoenix has demonstrated to be one of the best actors of our generation, and this film is going to be remembered as one of his more intense and memorable roles. I can't say much more about the film itself but to check it out.My only issue is not about the movie itself, but with the concept of the movie. The movie is a psychological drama, and deals with urban alienation and realistic violence. It is very heavy. But, while watching the movie, then the Batman references came out and I thought 'Oh yeah, this is a Batman movie. This guy is the Joker, you know, the same character which in another incarnation participated in a surf contest with Batman'. It felt odd. The Joker is a comic-book character, and although you can touch serious subjects with these characters, I think it's very difficult to make something SO serious. In Dark Knight, for example, the movie touched many serious subjects, but the movie itself was an action and crime drama, so it felt in the right context. In this case, it was a bit odd.But, that is a meta criticism, and it's not in detriment of the movie itself which is excellent. If you want to see a serious movie, about serious subjects, watch this, and also, The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver, which were a direct inspiration for this movie.10/10",10,3,7,23 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," 'Dark movie' is not equal to 'Good movie'
","So ends the disappointing 'Prequel Trilogy' of Star Wars. The first movie was lamely disappointing, the second was just lame, and then we got the third one, the first Star Wars rated PG-13: there goes the excuse of 'these movies are for children'. But this movie was acclaimed by many fans, who said 'the first two were awful, but this one is good!', 'Lucas had two strikes, now he made a Homerun', etc. I only have one explanation for comments such as these: 'Low-expectation syndrome'. After being exposed as a mediocre director and writer for his last movies, in the Revenge of the Sith, no one were expecting cinematic gold from Lucas anymore (except die hard fan-boys). So, a mediocre film with writing as sloppy as common with Lucas during the last ten years, but with some 'dark twists' (spoilers!), such as killing children (oops, younglings, sorry), killing Samuel L. Jackson, and a guy horribly burned and mutilated by his 'best friend', was a bit refreshing after all the 'kid-friendly' stuff of the previous movies. I was impressed the first time I saw the movie, but it got old really fast.Again, Lucas is haunted by his own words: 'Special Effects without a good story is just boring'. The movie delivers yet again unimpressive effects which Lucas still thinks they'll make us scream 'wow!' at the cinema... Lucas, please get it: special effects aren't impressive anymore. The acting is mediocre, but that's not so much the actors to blame, but the lazy writing ('you are so... beautiful', yeah, that's gold). The story is an incoherent mess with boring dialog and pointless side-plots, rushed up to put Anakin in the Darth Vader suit at the end.I don't like to nitpick on 'plot holes' but I'll comment in this one: So, Anakin is having dreams of his wife being killed by pregnancy, and then he's duped into the Dark Side by Palpatine... how, you ask?, he just tells him a vague story of some guy who 'defeated death' once... that's so lazy, that I can only think in two explanations: a) Anakin is just stupid. b) Anakin was always a bad guy, and all the 'Padme dying stuff' was just an excuse. The tragedy of his fall evaporates at once.I must address, though, that this movie is superior to its predecessors by two simple points. First: at least, we feel that something is on stake here. Second: the plot, lazy as it is, at least is more defined than in the last movies.So, the prequels have been finished at last. Now, we can all forget these mediocre and boring movies, pretend they never existed, and return to watch the Original Trilogy, which probably will endure more than the Prequel Trilogy, for a simple reason: good stories + good effects = good films. Lazy stories + good effects = boring films.5/10",5,4,7,20 March 2011
Black Panther," Beautiful
","This movie is a counterpoint to Thor: Ragnarok in the MCU. It's basically the same plot: a new king must secure his succession to the throne, and must fight challengers along the way. But when Thor is light and funny (and excellent in that regard), Black Panther is serious and surprisingly tragic. In each moment in this movie, the stakes are high, and the marvelous cinematography and incredible music are great to introduce us in the kingdom of Wakanda, and its magical ways and exotic costumes. As a superhero movie, it's more deep, tragic and reflexive than usual. Really the characters are forced to face difficult questions, which the audience will find in a real moral dilemma to answer. This is not just the case of a stock villain trying to 'take over whatever'. There is a deep context in all the decisions the characters must face, and the movie is not trying to evade any of those questions.Thor: Ragnarok was a celebration of fun and good times in a superhero movie. Black Panther was a reflexive introspection of the themes of supeheroes and violence. Both movies excelled in their settings, so both movies deserve the 'really remarkable' score.10/10",10,3,14,22 February 2018
Signs," How to ruin a good suspense film.
","Signs is quite an effective suspense movie. The tone is ominous, the acting is reserved and it really creates a good ambiance, which makes the movie feels very intriguing. M. Night Shyamalan is a good director creating these types of environments, and I think, this is one of his best efforts.(spoilers)But, alas, the movie mysteries need to be resolved. And the resolution of all the interesting themes is just a ridiculous, forced and unconvincing Deus Ex Machina. Many have argued that the point of the movie is not 'an alien invasion' but 'a man struggling and recovering his faith'. Fair enough, but even then, the resolution is completely forced. So, in the end, God caused (or allowed) the car accident that killed Mel Gibson's wife just for she to save their family in an alien invation, by giving some vague advice about telling Joaquin Phoenix to swing a bat on these guys?. Please, read again those last sentences. It is completely forced and ridiculous, and it completely kills the movie.The thing is, this can be a good movie, as long as you don't think about it very much, and I think that's the reason it initally received good critiques. It's a thrilling ride, but the resolution makes everything to be pointless and ridiculous. Perhaps in some cases, it's the journey that counts, but in this case, the destination is just so forced and stupid, that it ruins everything.In my opinion, this movie has value. It's interesting to watch, and it has some very tense and scary moments. It's just that the resolution of the plot is so, so poor, that it makes it all pointless in the end.5/10",5,1,3,7 February 2019
Beowulf," I'm not a fan of CGI movies, but...
","... this one worked for me. Yeah, it's CGI, and yeah, it's lame, and the comparisons between the action scenes and a 'videogame cut-scenes' are common in this cases. But, alas, in this case I wouldn't go so far about it. Why?, because it's a really good story, with classic characters, with interesting twists on the original story of Beowulf, and, in the end, I felt it worked.Here's the thing: when you watch a cartoon movie, also feels fake, because you can always say: 'it's just a bunch of cartoons'. But are many animated movies which are classics, because of the characters, the story and the feeling it delivers. CGI movies are not classic animation, in the sense that is trying to imitate real environments. It's good?, in general, I would say it isn't good, because, most of the times, it feels like an attempt to give 'eye candy' to the audience, rather than tell a good and interesting story (said... Star Wars prequels?). But the story of Beowulf is so classic, and good, it overcomes these problems, and at times, I almost forgot I was watching a bunch of pixels, and rather, a good adventure movie.Recommended: Check it out.8/10",8,0,0,18 May 2011
The Matrix," Somewhat unoriginal, but a visual achievement
","Matrix was, in many ways, the minor 'Star Wars' of the 90s: an unoriginal and arch-repeated story, but told and crafted in such a creative way, that it works!. The story of the 'chosen one' in his path to discover his powers is older than graphite pencils, but, the visuals and the setting are impressive enough to makes us forget that and enjoy the ride. Keanu Reeves is a great choice for the role of 'Neo', and the supporting cast is good enough also. The story is crafted as a mystery at the beginning, and then begins the classic 'hero's journey'. And, at the end (spoilers!), unsurprisingly, the character becomes a 'superhuman', inside the Matrix and kills the bad dude: a nice closed loop, which doesn't leave much space for sequels, which is the main reason of why the following movies in the 'saga' are just a shameful mess.But, Matrix, as a stand-alone film, is very good. The only problems I can think of, are some issues with the acting (Carrie Ann Moss was somewhat dull), the over-pretentiousness of the plot: it took itself way too seriously, being as it was, just an unoriginal sci-fi collage, and the visual style grew old too fast, now a days the characters look dressed as a bunch of emo-kids. But, those are details and nitpicking. It's a good, intense and entertaining action flick. Check it out.8/10",8,0,1,20 March 2011
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A cinematic achievement
","There is not much to say about the original Star Wars movie which haven't already been said a million times. These movies have been analyzed in multiple levels, but the best way to describe the original one, in my humble opinion, is: this movie is a celebration. A celebration of movie-making as a visual media, with an endurable and magic story, full of adventure and excitement: that's the lasting appeal of Star Wars. Aside of all the hype or pseudo-intellectualism surrounding the criticisms of the movie, the simple fact is that it's just a familiar story ('The peasant rescues the princess and becomes a knight'), told in such a visually creative way and funny mood, that it becomes something entirely fresh and new.Leaving aside the criticism George Lucas deserves for some other movies he made before and after 'Star Wars', it's undeniable that this was his finest hour, and one of the finest moments in cinematic history.10/10",10,1,1,20 March 2011
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," An excellent follow-up, for a cinematic achievement
","After Star Wars was released, madness came and invaded George Lucas' professional and personal life. Suddenly, a self-avowed abstract filmmaker was the center of media and fan attention. Star Wars became a hot name in cinema, so a sequel was demanded by almost everyone.The good thing of the original 'Star Wars' was that it was made resembling classic Sci-Fi serials in the 40s and the 50s, such as Flash Gordon, so it had an episodic feel: at the end of the original movie, there were many 'plot-threads' open to explore: Luke becoming a Jedi, Darth Vader, the fate of the rebellion, etc. So, after three years of production, came 'The Empire Strikes Back'. And it didn't disappoint.The movie somewhat loses the light and charming mood of the original, but replaces it with character development, drama and concept exploration. The space adventure feel is more serious this time: it's not the scenario of 'saving the princess' anymore, rather a cat and mouse chase, with a feeling of doom surrounding the characters. There is learning, adventure, introspection, confrontation, betrayal, revelations, and at the end, a well crafted cliffhanger, leading to the next movie.'Empire' is somewhat more respected by Sci-Fi fans than the original 'Star Wars', maybe because it took itself more seriously than the last one. The first movie had the mood of a 'fairy tale in space'. This one has more dramatic and introspective tones, and a more dreadful scenario. At the end, the fate of one of the main characters is left unknown for the audience: this movie took risks.To summarize, this is not in the same vein as the original 'Star Wars', but it has an excellent development, story and tone, which makes this movie an enjoyable experience and an endurable classic. A masterpiece for the Sci-Fi-fantasy genre.10/10",10,0,1,21 March 2011
The Cabin in the Woods," At last, an intelligent deconstrucion of the slasher movie
","After years and years of repeating the same old tropes (and playing with them such as in Scream), at last, a perfect deconstruction of the tired and boring clichés that plague this genre.(HUGE SPOILERS NEXT) The point of the movie is 'these stories are played this way to satisfy gods', which gods?, the horror movie audience, of course!. They are the torture porn addict gods, and reading some comments here about how this movie 'isn't scary' shows how good this movie hits on the mark. Slasher flicks plots are just as pointless and repetitive as the ritual sacrifices in the movie, and if they are not played just straight as the audiences want, they got angry and 'destroy' the movie. (END OF SPOILERS)But, in any case, aside from any pedantic deep reading, if you take this movie just for what it is, then it's just a silly comedy, and funny as hell. It has excellent moments, jokes, and some scary jumpy stuff from time to time. Just don't expect a normal 'slasher flick', but a 'very dark comedy' and you'll enjoy it.10/10",10,0,3,3 February 2013
