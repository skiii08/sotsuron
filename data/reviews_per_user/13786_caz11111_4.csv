The Rock," Good action movie with a great performance by Ed Harris
","The Rock was a sometimes overdone action movie which was nonetheless well made and superbly acted.  Connery, as the only man ever to escape, is in fine form here.  Cage provides a humanizing portrait of a reluctant action hero.  He's excellent, but for his best work in an action movie, check out Face/Off (with a much more complex set of characters). The standout here is Harris' outstanding performance as the conflicted General. Harris gives Hummel a passionate conviction that he is doing the right thing, combined with a genuine desire to resolve things peacefully (witness the confrontation with the Seals where he tries desperately to save his enemies' lives).  Because Harris is so good in the role, the movie's ending is a letdown as it shortchanges the fascinating character he has created.",Null,2,2,25 February 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A stunning masterpiece...
","This is one of the best fantasy films ever made and in many ways transends the genre.  Peter Jackson shows real genius in taking the story from book to screen and the cast is flawless.  As Frodo, Elijah Wood captures the haunted innocence of his character: he would rather pass the task off to someone else but knows deep down that he must bear the Ring.  Ian McKellen is ideal as Gandalf: warm, witty, brave and wise.  Sean Astin make Sam into the kind of devoted friend we all need to have.  Liv Tyler's short appearance as Arwen represents the best work of her career, she has real chemistry with Viggo Mortensen's aragorn (more on him in a second)and their scenes together are tender and passionate.  Cate Blanchett is regal, enigmatic and golden as the Elf Queen Galadriel while suggesting her character's potential for evil should she succumb to her desire for the ring.  Likewise, Ian Holm's tortured Bilbo, a good 'man' (hobbit) who passes the ring on to Frodo, also demonstrates the devastating effects the ring has.  In one of the movie's most frightening moments, he turns monstrous as he lunges for the ring on Frodo's neck.  Orlando Bloom moves with deadly elegance as the elf Legolas and Jonathan Rhys Davies imbues Gimli with bluster and courage.The two best performances have been saved for last: Viggo Mortensen and Sean Bean.  Mortensen is superb as Aragorn: charismatic and heroic, yet fearing that he may be too weak to resist the ring (his ancestor was unable to resist the ring, hence Aragorn's fear).  Mortensen's scenes with Liv Tyler as Arwen are perfectly realized and hopefully the two will share more screen time in the two sequels.  Bean is equally brilliant as the valiant but flawed Boromir, whose surrender to his lust for the ring leads to disaster. Indeed, one of the high points of the film is the final conversation between Aragorn and Boromir, when each man comes to a deeper understanding of himself and one another.All in all, a masterpiece.",10,0,0,23 December 2001
American Beauty," Brilliant film
","American Beauty is a stunning film, superbly directed by Sam Mendes with a great screenplay by Alan Ball.  Its message is not entirely original (the themes of suburbia repressing people's true natures; appreciating beauty in the world; being true to yourself have all been explored before).  Rarely, though, has a film been this passionate about them.  This is in large part due uniformly superb performances from the cast.  The standouts are the mesmerizing turn by newcomer Wes Bentley and the absolutely brilliant performance turned in by Kevin Spacey (it will be a travesty if he doesn't win the Oscar).  Bentley's Ricky is creepy at first but slowly we come to understand that his intensity and serenity are due to an absolute appreciation of the world around him and its beauty.  Spacey, meanwhile, is stunning as Lester, simultaneously cynical, rueful, tender, sad  and sarcastic.  In the movie's second half, the actor achieves a level of acting that can be described as art.  As Lester comes closer to his own final epiphany, the final step in his quest to recapture the joy of living, Spacey will blow you away.  This is one of the greatest performances of the last decade and it is only the greatest achievement in a spectacularly good film.",10,0,0,3 March 2000
Aliens," terrific sci-fi
","Aliens is one of the best science fiction movies of the 1980s.  First rate, fast moving direction by James Cameron moves the action along smoothly and relentlessly.  Performances are aces, with special kudos going to Sigourney Weaver and Michael Biehn. Weaver is dynamic as a woman who rationally understands what she's getting into but is brave enough to face her fears. As she must deal with aliens, sleazy (and dangerous) comapny man Burke, nurturing Newt and leading the defense against the Aliens, Weaver shows us a resourceful and brave woman.  Biehn is outstanding as the soft spoken Corporal Hicks, who proves to be the one person Ripley can turn to to lean on.  Biehn gives Hicks intelligence, authority, cool and bravery to create a memorable character.  We really feel that he grows to care deeply for Ripley and Newt.  Watch the scene where he cannons through bulletproof glass to save them.  Watch the scenes where he and Ripley quietly talk and realize how alike they are.  Great performances, great direction.",Null,0,0,28 February 2000
