First Man," This is a smart and subdued movie
","The movie is slow and introverted, exactly like its subject. At times, it is a bit boring, but for me, the last 30 minutes were worth any pain and boredom. The music is gorgeous and that whole part is at the same time triumphant and heartbreaking.",9,0,1,2 March 2019
