The Expendables 2," Fully loaded heavyweight cast but script, acting and plot is missing.
","This is a boring movie with a huge cast. As expected Arnold, Sylvester,jet lee, Van Damme and Sthatham all can deliver individually but not collectively. how a director you can justify the roles of all of them in one single movie?. Script was weak and also the level of acting is poor. Most of them are over aged than the requirement of the role. Only thing which force me to watch this is its cast, its reality nobody can ignore this movie having this big cast but this is sort of movie which you watch once and then forgets. If there were no Arnold, Sylvester, Statham, jet lee i would have given it 3/10 but having all of them force me to gave it 5/10.",5,0,3,8 October 2012
