First Man," What a disappointment.
","Oh my, where to start.Great cast of actors based on real characters, a great story line based on history but a great let down in my view.This could have been so much better. The main point that ruined this movie for e was the ridiculous sound effects.I could imagine vibration very easily but rocket engine noise in the vacuum of space?A really annoying upwards scale type of noise when scenes of supposed excitement occur.Just these two items stopped me from my enjoying the film. Perfectly good premise but badly written and with terrible sound effects.I normally really like science / space based movies such as this but in this instance it was such a let down.I gave it 3 out of 10.....",3,6,9,9 March 2019
The Men Who Stare at Goats," A movie that goes from bad at the beginning to worse at the end.
","When I viewed this title I thought to have such a line up of actors such as George Clooney, Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey the movie had to be extremely good.In my view the only funny parts of the film involved two events both including Clooney' character. I have to say I was extremely disappointed, if this is the type of title we can expect from Messrs Clooney, Bridges and Spacey I don't think I'll bother to watch any more from them.The plot was poor, even though allegedly based on a true event, the acting was poor and to have such a very good line up of actors, I can only think this was for reasons of very clever publicity.There was one funny thing attached to this movie though and that was the reviews given by the national newspapers and media in the UK, some had the audacity to give it four or five stars and to even call it 'Uprorious fun'. All I can say is that they must know of another meaning of the word fun that I don't.",1,8,16,22 April 2010
Sin City," Very well thought out movie
","Sin City is a rather strange movie, you start watching it and whilst doing so you seem to think it isn't up to much, then a little piece comes along and you think to yourself I'd better watch a little bit more.When the end comes it hits you just how good a movie it is. I have to admit until this film was released I hadn't heard of Frank Miller. I hear that he has two Sin City sequels planned, if they are as good as Sin City 1 I can't wait.The characters lives are all intertwined so that the way in which the story comes to life is fantastic. Quentin Tarantino having a role in its making as special guest director does not surprise me. I'd like to know how much of an influence he had with Miller as it seemed to me that you could see his direction and mannerisms in every part of the movie.The primary character is Marv (Mickey Rourke), for some reason this guy does not know when to give up; this is one of his traits in the movie that endears you to him. He's a typical bad looking guy with a big heart who deals with his enemies with equally big fists. He also seems to have a penchant for jackets.From what I can make out the secondary and tertiary characters are Police Detective Hartigan (Bruce Willis) and Dwight (Clive Owen), Willis is typical Willis and did not do anything for me. Clive Owen on the other hand with his menacingly calm way of dealing with people in the movie again was a treat.Jessica Alba is given billing ahead of Clive Owen in the credits however I can't think why given her short but without exception, excellent appearance.From start to finish the action grabs you, that it is mainly shot in black and white certainly added to my enjoyment of the movie. Elijah Wood plays a character called Kevin, his purpose in the movie is quite strange, he seems to be a kind of hybrid apathetic killing machine, I never did quite find out what he was, human, robot, whatever? The late Rutger Hauer has a small but central part in the story as Cardinal Roark, the family of this name seems to run everything in Sin City and its environs. There are many other first rate actors, too many to mention.It's one of those movies that don't look much until you've watched it, having watched it many times since I would definitely recommend it.",10,2,4,2 July 2005
