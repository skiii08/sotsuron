Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Wonderful failure
","It is easy to dismiss the hard work of others. This movie is visually one of (if not) the most stunning films ever made. Imaginative settings and scenery, next generation effects. But sadly there was no story. A good writer would have propped up all the action and amazing visual talent with a story that mattered. Alas there was no such story (if much of any story at all). Only the ending scenes evoked any emotion for me. Even the 'dramatic' conclusion of the light saber battle left me hollow and not caring. The actors were very talented, but why did they seem like they were sleep walking? And unfortunately the critics were right: Anakin was badly miscast, almost dragging the whole notion of the prequel into doubt. The one task episodes I-III must do is to portray and dramatize the tragedy of Anakin's transformation to Darth Vader. In order for this to work we must care deeply for Anakin. And with 1/3 of the story gone I have to say I for one could care less.",4,0,1,22 May 1999
Moulin Rouge!," What most movies oday are not
","This movie shows off everything that is wrong with most movies today, because it is so imaginative, such a creation of one mans vision, and so different than what is around it.Don't miss this movie, see it is a theater with good prints and good 7.1 sound system. The visuals, music and sound and first rate and an experience not to be missed.Makes other movies seem like what they are, the same old tired drivel...",10,0,1,12 July 2001
Mystic River," Awful, awful movie
","Overwrought, pointlessly stylistic, and really really bad. No matter how hard I try I can not think of one positive comment to make about this movie. Penn's acting was sheer scenery chewing, and by the end I couldn't wait for the last ten minutes to be over.The first half of the movie is nothing but setup, done in a very heavy handed manner. The second hand begins to roll along and promises that maybe something interesting will be revealed, but as the movie hits its climax you realize it has nothing to offer. At best it is a good portrayal of a particular kind of neighborhood and family life that may be fading.The interesting thing is that very good actors are sunk by the script or the direction. Many talented people, who have done very well in other movies, struggle and fail here. The only actor not completely taken down is Kevin Bacon. It is ironic that he is the only one that did not receive a nomination.I am not sure what everyone saw in this movie, but beware, don't be taken in by the positive ratings. It is a hollow movie masquerading as a good movie.",4,3,6,27 November 2005
Shrek," Call me an Ogre
","I am not sure I understand why this movie was so well received by critics. It is an ok movie, but there is not an original idea or even a coherent story. It relies almost entirely on references to other stories, movies and even companies (Disney), and the animation, while technically impressive,lacked any 'magic' or true beauty.Also I was turned off by its blunt attempts at appealing to both kids and adults (with a sledgehammer approach) and the way overblown music.So call me an Ogre, but please don't make me watch this again...",5,1,2,9 July 2001
The Thin Red Line," Thin Beige Plot
","Well, hmmmm, errrrr, it was about....grass. Lots of grass. Waving. In different lighting conditions. Over and over again.This movie proves that no matter how 'beautiful' a movie is, it must begin and end with a script, a story. This movie had none. And what passed for 'observation' was so shallow, cliched (and hate to say it, stupid) the audience would have to have read nothing beyond Readers Digest or seen no TV beyond Sesame street to find this engaging or 'deep.'A complete waste of time.",2,0,1,17 January 1999
