Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," my favorite star wars episode of all time
",I am a huge fan of star wars and I love episode 1 its really good and fun I know its not the best in series because it takes too long but its my favorite its nice to see some old characters from the old star wars films return and have some new characters my favorite characters in this film are Jar Jar he is funny I don't get it why people hate him and I love the battle ships they are really good I find them the best models in the series and the CGI effects where very well done it made it look so realist and story begins the start of the sage how it begging so you can't be a fan of old star wars films to hate this one its really good but its very underrated and should get a better rating not because of the plot but the characters the CGI effects and the story of a young boy who turn bad in the old star wars films but even Theo its not the best in the series but episode 3 is the best in series but this one is really good and is great for any star wars fans but even Theo its not as great as the old star wars its still bloody good movie All in all its my favorite episode and it will stay that way I give this movie a 8.7 out of 10.,8,7,13,9 February 2011
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," another forgotten classic
",101 Dalmatians is a very good movie indeed which is said more for its sequel which had to be one of the worst sequels. The live action 1996 version was good but no where near as good as this. The animation is wonderful and the characters are great I love Jasper and Horace they were wonderful and funny to watch I love their Truck I think this has to be one of the most forgotten classics and getting ruined by a sequel which Sucked. I was watching this movie again one youtube and I gotta say its still good to watch. The puppies are cute and this movie has to get another chance so please give it another chance I give this a 9.1 out of 10 still wrath watching,9,3,3,6 September 2011
Coraline," one of the best Tim Burten movies I have seen
",Along with The night mare before Christmas Coraline has to be one of my favorite Tim Burton movies The story is amazing about Coraline wanting her family to be more fun and finds a doll that looks like her and finds an other world that is the same but finds buttons on the world she meets The other mother who is also the bad guy of this film a lot more scarer then some other bad guys in some other cartoon films and also meets The other father my favorite character of this film but sadly died at the near end of the film. I find this film good amazing and looks so realist this has to be one of the best films of 2009 I think this movie is great for all the fans of Tim Burton so what to say of this movie its so amazing. I like Coraline Wiby and The cat but while The other father is my favorite. So if you love The night mare before Christmas and the other Tim Burton films then you will like this one this has to be one of my favorite cartoon or non cartoon films I give it a 9.4 out of 10. very good.,9,1,2,19 April 2011
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," better then inspector gadget 2 and almost as good as eps 3
",This one had me amazed its better then eps 1 and almost as good as eps 3 its got new characters in it and some old characters from the old first star wars and eps 1 I will stared off with the old characters jar jar is more smarter then he was in eps 1 c3po with his covers like in the old star wars films r2d2 flying thats SO cool and r5d4 making cameo in the background great one and now for the new characters r4p17 not the best robot in the series but he is cool. This shows how the clone troopers be came part of the old star wars which was brill and cool as well battle against them and the battle droids was great I feel this movie should get 9 out of 10 for showing love scenes and great battle scenes and Yoda with his light saver great job and for having him on action with his light saver I hope they show his light saver again in the TV series which comes out in 2011 lets hope he has it I have got this movie out on DVD and along with eps 1 and 3 cool some day I would do a remake scene with c3po with his head coming that would be great over all great movie 9 out of 10,9,5,8,9 November 2010
Cars 2," so much better then the Original
",OK the first Cars was a great movie and problay an underrated Pixar movie which I thought it could get higher rating. OK its not a Perfect movie but it was still a fun movie to watch over and over again but the sequel Cars 2 is way more underrated then the first movie and people dislike it come on its a great sequel and one of the better sequels Which I love. 5 reasons why this movie is a lot more better then the first 1.in the first movie their was nothing but Cars but in this one their is Trains boats planes and flying gadgets which Mater uses 2. the plot in this movie is a lot more stronger the plot in the first movie was a little bit weak 3. I think its a lot more darker then the first movie 4. I think this movie should get a better then 6.5/10 5. Pixar never lets me dawn on a movie their is nothing wrong I don't like about this film don't be foiled I do love the first cars a lot but the 2nd one will always be my favorite I give it 10 out of 10.,10,4,7,8 October 2011
Toy Story," one of the best movies of 1995
",toy story is another successful Disney 90s flick of the 90s followed by A goofy movie The lion king and inspector gadget 1 and the other 90s Disney movies this one is so outstanding its about toys that come to life when their owner is not looking and are feared about getting replaced if you can remember Johnson and friends the kids TV series where toys come to life and feared that they are going to be replace but that has nothing to do with this very successful movie I love this movie to bits its good fun and great for kids and adults too if you have toys in your room you night think they are alive trust me you can think of it so if you love Disney movies like A goofy movie Herbie the love bug The lion king or other very successful Disney movies from the 50s 60s 70s 80s 90s or the early 2000s then you will love this one its great to have for your Disney DVD or VHS sets.I give this movie a 10 out of 10 because people really love it.,10,0,0,2 February 2011
Alice in Wonderland," a good movie but could of been tiny bit more stronger
",I remember growing up with the cartoon Alice in wonderland it was a wonderful film and one of Disney's classics films and now we have this remake to it made by Tim Burton who made the night mare before Christmas and Coraline which where amazing films This by the way is pretty good but it does have a few problems one of the main problems is that Alice does not want to kill an evil creature and I found this movie a little bit too dark it was also a bit too long. Okay the story is about Alice who is going to get married to some guy I don't remember what his name was but he looks like the guy from the new series of Doctor who and she finds the rabbit with the clock and chases him to the tree where she feels in as a kid and meets the hatter and some new characters which did not appear in the cartoon before. But all Theo this movie is pretty good but I think the writing could of been a little bit more stronger with the plot from the begging to the end its still a good movie but needs to be a bit more stronger if you know what I mean But still a good movie with a few problems and needs stronger story line I give this movie a 7.2 out of 10 pretty good.,7,1,1,9 April 2011
Toy Story 2," Far more than a sequel
",When it comes for a sequel by Disney I am so disappointed with it. But Toy Story 2 is far more Better one for both Kids and Adults pixar has darn it again with a great sequel to a Great film. During my early childhood years I was not impressed by CGI but this on the other hand blows my head away. It was so great to see the toys get a bigger adventure then the Frist one. My favorite part in the film was where the toys are crossing the road. All throe CGI was bit cheesy and the story was slow its still a great sequel over all 9/10 wrath watching make sure you see Toy Story 3 that one rocks.,9,0,1,3 July 2012
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," So whats the point on hating the prequels because They are the main thing of What brought us Darth Vader and Luke
",First I got to say is I love episode 3 its much better then the first 2 movies put together. Put I do still love the episodes 1 and 2 a lot. I think George had a great idea for making the series a huge hit. Put why are people hating the prequels so much come on get over with it prequels derve another chance they are not as bad as what they think it out to be.As a huge Star wars fan I wanted to watch episode 1 and 4 to 6 and I loved them but being little confused with before episode 1 to 4 I brought episode 2 and 3 to find out who this little boy became the most bad ass villain and how we get Luke. Star wars episode 3 with out adat is a great movie its wrath seeing. so if you don't like episodes 1 and 2 then skip them and go to this one instead. it was also nice to see episode 1 in 3D it felt like a different movie. 10 out of 10.,10,1,2,7 April 2012
The Truman Show," great movie a little bit cheesy and a bit overrated
",I am not hater of this movie but some of the songs where bit bad in it I am not saying its not an awful movie but being that some of the songs where bit bad there some good songs in it. OK about the story its about guy who has beem taken care of some actors in this and he does not know its real and many people try to get in his way to stop him getting into other places as well. He trys to get out but fails he trys one more time to get out because in his teenage hold he find someone that he really loves and they took her way from him which is the fact he want to get out and find his true love that was the fact that made this movie really good not to bad not to stupid. I love the boat scene where he trys to get out which really good but and thats how movie should be. I know that some people disagree about this but I don't disagree about hating this movie. Its pretty good but some of songs where bit bad and some good. But its great for all ages but great movie its show how we feel inside. great movie 7 out of 10. pretty good,7,0,0,5 November 2010
