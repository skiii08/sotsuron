The Blair Witch Project," Sorry, but bundles of twigs AREN'T scary!
","I avoided seeing this film for a long time because of the hype and now I wish I had stayed true to my instincts. It is very long, very boring and has not a single scare. It has obnoxious characters screaming at either nothing or bundles of sticks. If they're not screaming, they're swearing, if they're not swearing, they're crying. This might have been a genuine scary experience for the actors, but it wasn't for me. I felt bored and irritated. I have a very good imagination, but this film did not inspire it at all. The only reason I watched to the end was to find out if anything justified the hype. But nothing did. I was just relieved that all the screams had been quenched. There are some films I am prepared to give a second chance to, but this isn't one of them. Thank goodness I didn't waste a cinema ticket. 2/10",2,2,4,2 February 2010
Beauty and the Beast," Wonderful, but additional not required. If it ain't broke...
","Beauty & the Beast is still one of my favourite Disney films. It has a feisty, book loving heroine, a gorgeous beast, entertaining support & a vile villain. Plus enchanting songs & colourful, detailed animation. My favourite character is Chip, the little teacup, who has a vital role to play. Alas, the gorgeous beast is eventually replaced, but that's for sake of the fairy tale. What we didn't need was a new musical number. It's just an unnecessary filler in that spoils the pace of the film. Be sure to watch to the end of the credits. There's a wonderful dedication to Howard Ashman. The voicework is fantastic & best of all, the film is in classic 2d. It's a shame we see less & less of that style nowadays. With notable exceptions like Ice Age, 3d animation lacks the uniqueness & charm of traditional films. CGI doesn't have to flaunt itself. It's the story & characters that truly matter. 8/10",8,1,2,19 November 2006
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Emotion level down, but still enjoyable. Scrat steals again!
","Ice Age is one of the best animations ever made so I was excited about the return of Scrat & co. While the new adventure doesn't have the same emotional impact as the first (less tear-jerky, I mean), it makes up for it with comedy. Scrat's attempts to hang on to his acorn are longer & even more hilarious. The Possums & their big 'sister' are excellent new characters, providing their own share of the laughs. The romance plot is less dramatic than the baby's tale, sometimes slowing the action. However it's sweet & provides some fun dialogue. Sid is brilliant, his mini adventure a definite highlight. Diego's role is reduced, but still vital. He's especially funny with Sid. If you enjoy the Ice Age films, I also recommend The Land Before Time adventures. They share the same formula & the same heart. 8/10",7,4,5,9 April 2006
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," MORE Gambit please!
","I love Gambit! He's the coolest. He doesn't appear until the final scenes of the movie, but he's a scene stealer alright. Cards - Check. Pole - Check. And he uses them and leaves you wanting MORE. Good casting. The accent is light, but that didn't matter. It's just so cool to see him. I hope he gets his own movie or at least appears in another Origins.I am a fan of Wolverine too and while waiting for Gambit, I enjoyed watching him. And Sabretooth. Lots of character cameos. It's entertaining, contains humour, as well as action,story & pathos. It ties in nicely with the X-Men films.Watch till the end of the credits. I rate it a 7.",7,5,10,6 May 2009
Brokeback Mountain," Heartbreaking love story.
","For me, Jake gave the best & most moving performance in this story of impossible love & dreams. While constantly pushed away & let down by his chosen one, Jack never gives up on him. He always hopes. The first time I saw this I hadn't read the story or any spoilers, so the ending was all the more effective. When I did read, I discovered that this is one of the most faithful adaptations ever. Perhaps scenes took place in a different order, but they're all in the film. (Apart from a disturbing flashback.) The minor characters are fleshed out nicely for the cinema. The scenery is breathtaking and the soundtrack well chosen. Especially the end title track. This is an experience that you just have to see or read for yourself. The tears will come.",8,17,19,1 January 2008
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," 'Woks, Jabba, Alien Musicians - Fun for everyone.
","This is my favourite of the Star Wars films. I'm referring to the original without the excess CGI. I love the Ewoks, especially Wicket. I'm not really into huge space battles so I preferred that this was set mainly on Endor. I enjoyed the scenes in Jabba's palace too. The blue elephant musician is cool. Jabba himself is a delightful creation. Fortunately Yoda, who I found annoying in Empire, only has minimum involvement. There are humorous moments, romance & valour. The Ewoks have the right blend of cuteness & savagery. You can also watch them in 'Caravan of Courage' & 'Battle for Endor'. The cartoon is good too. Most of the aliens are fun to view, although I was less than impressed with those accompanying Lando. Still rather them than the CGI overkill in 'Phantom Menace.' Sometimes simplicity works best. 9/10",8,0,0,12 March 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Gollum's great; Battle's boring; Best of Three!
","After seeing all 3 films, 'Towers' is my favourite, mainly because of Gollum/Smeagol, brought brilliantly to life by Andy Serkis. The debate scene is the stealer but all his interactions with Frodo & Sam are laudable. (I was disappointed that the 'Sneaking!' sequence was omitted. It's appears too late in the 3rd film & sadly pales in comparison to the animated version. And the written version, naturally.) I also like Pippin & Treebeard. Unfortunately the other characters don't share the same appeal & I've never been a fan of huge battles. Helm's Deep goes on forever! The Aragon/Arwen relationship doesn't excite either. But Gollum has been an hero of mine, ever since I saw him in the original animated film. Be sure to see that too. 8/10",8,0,0,9 April 2004
Shrek the Third," Best of 3.
","I hated the first Shrek because it was crude and insulted several of my favourite 2D animations. I also found the main characters annoying. I did not understand the mass appeal, since I rarely laughed. It was a long time before I watched Shrek 2, but I'd seen a toy Dronkey and was curious. How were they going to explain it? As it turned out, they didn't and the dronkeys were just a cameo. Loved them though. Loved them enough to buy Shrek 3.Yes!!! More dronkey action. And some green babies too. It's a shame Shrek and Dronkey's children didn't get more screen time, but there were a lot of characters, old & new, to squeeze in. This time I was surprised to discover that I was laughing a lot more and sympathising more. There was less crudity and mockery. I didn't enjoy the bitching Princesses, but everybody else was appealing.You can't always judge a DVD by the films that came before it. 8/10",7,5,7,16 June 2008
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Sweet & Funny Recipie
","Preferring 2D animation, I did not have high hopes for this film. So many rely on big names, adult humour & cruel parody. Also, apart from the Ice Age trilogy, the visuals aren't usually cute. But I was pleasantly surprised by this sweet & funny effort. Flint is a sympathetic lead. His enthusiasm leads to trouble for the whole town, but backed by some loyal & eccentric companions, he is determined to set things right. Bruce Campbell enjoys his role as the mayor, as does Mr T as the police chief. Steve the monkey has scene stealing moments too. Visual and spoken jokes work well. There is the standard father-son relationship, but this is resolved in a new way. The junk food message is given without hammering. A fun adventure for the whole family. 8/10",9,1,1,22 September 2010
Ice Age," Heartwarming. Brilliant animation & characters.
","While most 3D films ('Toy Story', 'Shrek' for example) have left me cold due to the emphasis on visuals or tasteless humour, Ice Age matches the warmth of 'The Land Before Time' the best 2D ever made. The hyperactive, unfortunate, Scrat sets the tone right at the start. Then we meet the melancholy Manny, the irresponsible Sid, the scheming Diego & the charming Roshan (or Pinkey as they call him.) They're all uniquely lovable & you root for them to succeed. The animation itself is awe inspiring. I especially liked the cave painting sequence, Scrat's intro & the lava bridge. There are some real tear jerker moments & others of pure comedy. The supporting characters, especially the rhinos & dodos, flesh out the story nicely. There's no offensive humour & is clearly aimed to entertain, whatever your age. The soundtrack was unfortunately not released but that's great too. The casting couldn't be better. I look forward to the sequel. 10/10",10,1,2,13 March 2004
Ice Age: Continental Drift," Scrat Steals Again. Fuzzy. Funny. Crowded.
","I'm a huge fan of the Ice Age Series, thanks to it being consistently warm & fuzzy. My ratings so far have been Original(10), Meltdown(7) & Dinosaurs(9)This latest installment introduces a large amount of new characters, including Sid's grandma, a gang of pirates, a new rodent tribe & Lewis, best friend of Peaches. The film does seem rather crowded as a result, but there are less comments from the general, background animals. If you watch carefully you'll see cameos from Buck, Rudi & Scratte. The star of the film is of course Scrat, who is still on the eternal acorn quest. (With even funnier results, especially under water.)It has the feel of a grand finale, especially when it shows the actors over the end credits. I wouldn't object to more though. I just wonder what happened to all the humans.",8,0,1,23 July 2012
Halloween," Good, but not enough action.
","I know this is the original slasher, but I don't think it's the best. (My favourite is Friday the 13th.) After the initial murder, you're kept hanging for the next. At least two thirds is without any killing, although you get many creepy glimpses of Mike. While this was effective, I was anxious for him to do something. His escape was good. Then he stalks. Finally it's night time. Slash time. I could certainly see the influence on Friday the 13th & others. Like Jason, Mike is silent, strong & surprising. There is no passion involved. The victims were the standard horny teenagers, heroine & cute kids. I just wish the bodies hadn't all been crammed into the third act. A useful blueprint though. 6/10",6,1,2,8 January 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Gollum disappoints! Pippin doesn't.
","Gollum & Pippin are my favourite characters in the books. While Gollum was superb in Towers, he was surprisingly weak here. (Except for the opening & the 'wouldn't harm a fly' scene.) The remainder were disappointing. The Gollum/Smeagol exchange was a pale reflection of the one in Towers. ('scuse pun) Even the sequence I most love, 'Sneaking!' seemed to lack something. (See animation for better rendering.) All respect to Andy. That voice is incredible. I just felt they could have been done better, given more time.
Pippin however was marvellous. He finally got the screen time he deserves, rather than just being comic relief. In fact he gets far more to do here than in the text, thankfully. A true hero.I'm an arachnophobe so I confess to having my eyes shut during certain scenes. I'm not a battle fan so I only paid attention to scenes involving hobbits. The other characters don't hold my interest. (This isn't the fault of the actors. They're just like the book. I simply prefer the hobbits & ents.)Weighing up the evidence I award ROTK ......... 6/10",7,0,0,14 April 2004
