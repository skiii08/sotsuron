Despicable Me 2," Great show, even for adults
","Completely loved this show and for a 40-somthing. After wasting money on garbage shows like WWZ and a few others we paid one more time and watched DM2 and have a great time. Loved the show, made up for the other disappointments. Lots of adult humor (and no, don't mean it that way, sorry Hollywood has programmed your brain that way) and great for kids too, of course. Had an actual plot not much different then Ian Flemming's works. Definitely great for kids. Great animation. Great acting. Lots of energy. Had a bit of Wild-e-coyote in there too. Funny and good ending!This 10 line bs from IMDb is pissing me off, fyi.",10,2,4,5 July 2013
Star Trek," From life long Trekkie ...
","To start, see this movie, Trekkie or not.I grew up with Star Trek, literally listening to it in the back ground as a 5 year old while my parents watched every episode. Then I watched every single show myself for years, over and over. I did not go as far as dressing up Trekkie however I would buy Star Trek relics. That said, Star Trek 2009 exceeded my expectations. The movie had all the thrills, tricks, plot lines, characters, and winner outcome of any Star Trek show, generation one or two - and went the extra few light years.Young crew and new effects did its job, bringing the same great feelings of the 1960's show right up to the Now. As someone who loved and made part of my thinking the original show and characters - thumbs up on to the productive of this version.Even though technically this is one of those retro shows, it does not in anyway feel retro. It is like the 1960's show leaped into today, picked up with the same great affection, with a lot more action, thrills, and all around great fun.Now the plot does have one silliness to it, lets just say the plot falls into a black hole for a second, but picks back up quickly.A great high! See it.",10,1,12,23 May 2009
Iron Man 2," Total Crap
","I had a feeling #2 would be #2. The ONLY memorable actor in this clown show was Mickey Rourke. Basically: This is not the first show. The first show had some soul and a story you can follow and get behind. Iron Man 2 is a Hollywood slop of arrogance. Instead of a good story they produced an overboard light and sound show that will leave you burned out. Let me explain the movie in child like terms: You love chocolate ice cream, and vanilla too, and Coke, and Sprite and Skiddles - so you mix all these things into one big gulp cup and drink. YUK, BLAA, BLAAAUCK. This is Iron Man 2.With out a story one can get behind, a movie becomes forgotten as soon as it is over. Except for the anger you have for blowing your money and time, this is remembered! I am going to have a difficult time trusting Robert Downey again.",1,7,15,11 October 2010
X-Men: The Last Stand," Director ruined movie
","X1 and X2 were different movies then X3. X3 has a new director who apparently could care less about the quality of the show or its characters but instead cares about the $$$. All aspects of X3 were rushed and poorly thought out. You could even see in the faces of the actors the uncomfortable sense of 'hurry and up get the movie over'.The only reason it received a good rating from Users is the momentum from the first two movies, on its own X3 would be a failure. It is obvious X3 was a sell out and a lead in to more $$$ in 2007's Wolverine. Why why why did the director change! Sad to see a great series die off.",6,11,18,10 October 2006
War of the Worlds," Worse ever
","A rating of 'awful' is fair for this movie. I have never seen such a bad movie, even comparing to the cheesy sci fi's from the 1950's. The main problem with this movie is how offensive the cast are and the lack of plot. The plot is not the same as H.G. Well's book, not even close.Tom is not too bad, other then his character is unreal, disjointed, and acts as a complete supplicant to his offspring. The little girl is the typical sick representation of a brat that Spielberg seems to be obsessed with. A mouthy brat girl who always observes important events first, out smarts all adults, and asks questions well above her age group. There is something deeply wrong with Spielberg. The brat son was essentially the same. All three primary characters, and the freak in the farm cellar, were not related to anything real, they were non-human characters. I've seen Japanese Anime with much more believable characters.The only reason I can conjure that motivated these people to make this trash movie is some kind of agenda to make Americans stupid and empower children over their dumb and impotent parents. Now that theory is the only good sci fi in this flick.",1,8,16,9 January 2006
Sin City," Non-Fiction
","I enjoyed this movie because of its non fiction appeal. I could not find anything unreal about its plot.Demonic politician with evil pedo spawn covered up with money his filth and crimes, catholic priest in cahoots with a satanic demon possessed serial killer freak, corrupt police, wicked people so debauched that whores appear as the decent people. The only good people are the few common people trying to live life who stand up to the plate to serve something higher.I did not want to see this movie because of its violence and sex, by the end fo the movie however I felt different. Knowing it was really non-fiction made the difference.",10,0,2,2 October 2005
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Congrats, even worse the #2
","This production is for 12 year old's. In short, it is trash, a joke, an immature disjointed jerk-off visual puke. Micheal Bay needs to apologize, resign, and not show his face again. What a waste of time and money. Just a few points:1. New girl = ugly bimbo with attitude. 2. Plot is so bad the original cartoon was better. 3. Focus is 100% on the brat kid so-called star. 4. Robots are immature retards. 5. Visual effects poor. 6. Dialogue pathetic, silly, adolescent. It appears this movie was made to suck up money from suckers, not to offer good entertainment. Classic Hollywood M.O.",1,3,8,4 October 2011
