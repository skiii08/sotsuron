Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A victim of the cynical and politically correct 90s...
","I went to this movie to watch one of my all-time favorite movie series: Star Wars.  I watched, was entertained, and left.  Phantom Menace did an excellent job of setting the beginning of the Star Wars story.  The acting fit the movie (no bad performances) and the special effects and action superb.No we get to the serious matter.  For people to call the character Jar-Jar Binks a 'racist' character is INCREDIBLY STUPID!  I am an African-American that is active in the NAACP.  I laughed when I saw Jar-Jar.  He was funny (and a little irritating).  The young man who played as Jar-Jar (an African-American) said that the character has alot of him in it.  His only frame of reference was his African-American upbringing.  Jar-Jar is not even close to the stereotypes in early movies depicting blacks and stupid, lazy, and slow-witted.I find it funny that people just overlook what Jar-Jar and his people did: Fight a battle against an enormous army of robots in defense of their way of life.  A slow-witted, lazy, and stupid people INDEED!  Fine if you thought the movie was dull or lacked character development.  BUT, to go with 'Jar-Jar is racist' theme is ignorant, stupid, and DOWNRIGHT ABSURD!",9,14,20,9 October 1999
12 Monkeys," 2nd time's a CHARM!
","When I first watched this movie, I had some difficulty following it, BUT I still enjoyed it.  But when I watched it a second time and fully absorbed it, I was speechless.  One of the most original films in modern sci-fi. When you fully realize the scope of this movie, you just keep thinking about.  A definite MUST SEE!",Null,0,1,25 January 1999
Blade," Action and then some...
","As a lover of action movies, my appetite was more than satisfied.  Blade delivers some awesome martial arts work and gunplay to keep action lovers like me entranced.  I am also an AVID vampire fan.  I would have liked the vampires to be a little more nasty but all in all, they represented well. The special effects were great and the storyline was solid.  Blade and Spawn should team up for an action movie.  The almost undead and the dead.  I'll go see that!  This movie is a great rental.",10,1,2,3 December 1998
The Mummy Returns," The story + the action + the effects = Good sequel!
","I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the movie on DVD (couldn't catch it at the cinema).  The beginning scenes featuring The Scorpion King (a new movie coming out in 2002) did a nice job of showing that this guy could be worse than The Mummy.  I feel that The Mummy Returns excels in showing the connection between the current characters and their Egyptian counterparts. I frankly don't understand the criticism of saying their was NO STORY or the STORY WAS BAD.  Where?  The story is simple and easy to understand.  Does that constitute as BAD.  No it does not.  The action, well that's an understatement.  There's enough quality action to satisfy the hungriest fans.  I found no bad performances in this movie (well the little boy could be a little irritating but what little boys aren't).  Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, and Arnold Vosloo stand out.  Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (Lock-Nah) looked like a throwback to the old Spartacas (sp?) type movie characters. Just a quality follow-up to a great movie.  I hope 'The Scorpion King' lives up to 'The Mummies'.  Can't do wrong buying the DVD.There is WAY TO MUCH over-analyzation in the bad comments about this movie. This isn't 'The Godfather'.",9,0,0,15 October 2001
