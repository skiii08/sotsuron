Frost_Nixon," Ron Howard makes a strong comeback... and so does Richard Nixon
","Ron Howard is certainly back on top after the disappointing results of the movie adaptation of 'The Da Vinci Code.' His direction and bringing of Peter Morgan's 'Frost/Nixon' to film is just incredible. Salvatore Totino's cinematography and Howard's direction make this film a two hour first-person look into history (although some of the events in the film are not entirely non-fiction) with the help of one of the best adapted screenplays of my time (adapted/written by Morgan himself).I was not alive to see the original 'Frost/Nixon Interviews,' but no prior knowledge of the Watergate scandal itself is needed to enjoy and appreciate this two-hour tour de force.Frank Langella portrays ex-president Richard Nixon and doesn't stretch every acting muscle in his body to play Nixon, but uses every single one of them and more to his fullest potential to embody Nixon himself. Langella's last 30 minutes on film sure are a sight to see, but his performance as a whole is certainly a big part of what makes this film a great one.It's enthralling but disappointing to see Michael Sheen give such an incredible performance in this film because he will most-definitely be overshadowed by his co-star come Oscar time. Sheen's transformation from 'talk-show host' David Frost to confrontational David Frost is just phenomenal. His final interview with Langella in the film is what will drive his chances.Salvatore Totino's cinematography in 'Frost/Nixon' brings his time to shine. Totino's cinematography brings Langella and Sheen's characters to be seen on screen as they would if they were on television. But in such a beautiful and innovative manner that you'd never know that the 'Frost/Nixon' interviews were shown on television, but rather made into the very film that you are watching. Bravo.",10,1,3,21 December 2008
Milk," Van Sant and Sean Penn create a 'fabulous' look at the life of Harvey Milk
","Wow... I still have tears. 'Milk' is very heart-breaking, yet even more inspiring to see the life of Harvey Milk portrayed (more like 'embodied') by Sean Penn and director Gus Van Sant in such an uplifting and (yet again) inspiring manner. I would have loved to have just shaken Harvey Milk's hand.The movie contains one of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen, and Sean Penn IS Harvey Milk. All of the supporting actors are FANtastic, but great ones to watch are Emile Hirsch as Cleve Jones, James Franco as Scott Smith, Josh Brolin as Dan White and Diego Luna as Jack. Sadly I think Franco and the VERY over-looked Diego Luna will be missed come next year's Oscar nods, however Oscar vet Josh Brolin and Oscar rookie Emile Hirsch are most-likely to receive a nod for their performances.Gus Van Sant's directing of this incredible cast makes a perfect blend of great film-making with great acting to make this film a perfect candidate for Best Picture and more. The cinematography by Harris Savides adds to the power of the film as well as the power of the words from Dustin Lance Black's top-notch screenplay.A MUST SEE!!!!!",10,3,8,23 December 2008
