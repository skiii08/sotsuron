The Incredible Hulk," 'Incredible Hulk' is Bulky on Action, Light on Plot
","Grade: B- 'The Incredible Hulk' is technically the second theatrical release based on the Marvel Comics super-hero. However, this film, directed by Louis Leterrier (The Transporter 2, Unleashed) apparently ignores the events of 2003's adjective-free Hulk which was directed by Ang Lee. Lead actor Edward Norton plays haunted scientist Bruce Banner in addition to contributing a script draft which was conditional upon his hiring as an actor (the WGA gives Zak Penn final official credit for the screenplay).The story continuesor begins againthe saga of former research scientist Dr. Banner, whose body was drastically mutated in the aftermath of a botched experiment involving improving human resistance to radiation. Now, in times of extreme anger or stress, Banner's gamma-irradiated cells expand exponentially, turning him into the outsized, super-muscled Hulkdriven by rage and prone to lash out at his tormentors with little restraint.General Thaddeus Ross (played by William Hurt) was present at the experiment that birthed the Hulk, as was his daughter Betty (Liv Tyler). Obsessed with bringing the fugitive Banner into custody, the general recruits a special commando unit, including one Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), on loan from the British military. When the general's team finally tracks down Banner to a Brazilian shantytown, things begin to go downhill for both Banner and the generalthe Hulk is unleashed and makes short work of everyone involved. But while most of the team is at least humbled by this turn of events, it only intrigues Blonsky, who then volunteers to be injected with a top-secret performance-enhancement cocktail.Unfortunately, the grim Blonsky doesn't remotely have the conscience of Banner, and he becomes increasingly aggressive in his attempts to bring down his quarry. Meanwhile, the trouble-prone scientist hitchhikes from Latin America all the way to the Virginia college where he and Betty worked. Stumbling into an awkward reunion with his former love, a second Hulk flare-up prompts the two to head to New York City, where a heretofore mysterious colleague of Banner has the equipment necessary to attempt a curebut the dogged Blonsky's lust for combat derails everything; his own mutation spins out of control, turning him into the monster Abomination. With military personnel literally being crushed by this new creature, a reluctant Banner realizes that the only thing that can stop the rampaging Blonsky may be the Hulk.If one is apt to believe circulating entertainment reports, Norton was allegedly miffed with Marvel studio executives who wanted a leaner, more action-driven final cut of the film compared to Ang Lee's slower, ponderous interpretation. As viewed, the film is a taut action vehicle, essentially becoming a chase thriller after the first Hulk-eruption. Quieter moments such as when Bruce and Betty first reunite or trailer-glimpsed scenes of an Arctic sojourn and Bruce's chat with a psychologist (Ty Burrell) are either truncated or not seen at all. Marvel Studios is self-financing their comic-strip based features now, so there is legitimate commercial concern here.Still, accommodating viewers who don't have stunted attention spans isn't really that bad. The Lord of the Rings movies found a way to keep the story literate and the action exciting. While prose-fiction hardliners may blanch at comparing Stan Lee's comic-book series to Tolkien, it helps to bear in mind that cool art-visuals alone aren't enough to keep a comic-book going for 45 years like the Hulk. The story, whether simple or complex, still needs to be in place. Hopefully it won't be another five years (or longer) before the Hulk shows up at cinema again, and maybe his handlers will believe in him enough to make the narrative as strong as the spectacle.",9,3,6,16 June 2008
The Hunger Games," Hunger Games Film Has Bite
","'Hunger Games' Film has Bite New film The Hunger Games takes place in the distant future of a post-apocalyptic United States. An obliquely-referred to war/cataclysm has purportedly decimated world resources, especially regarding food—and the country has been divided into 12 impoverished districts. For seven decades, once a year, a lottery is held in which two children from each of the districts are chosen to participate in gladiatorial combat. The conflict is, of course, to the death— the sole survivor wins the lion's share of vital rations for their district, and one presumes, bragging rights.The film's heroine is the dramatically-named Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence.) Katniss is quite adept in the use of a bow and arrow, with which she hunts animals for food and to earn money for the family—her mother apparently had a nervous breakdown when Katniss's father died in a coal-mining accident. This year, district 12's female lottery 'winner' is initially Katniss's younger sister, which prompts Katniss to volunteer in her place. The male contestant from her district is Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), who harbors a long-dormant crush on Katniss.In an extended, perverted version of being fattened up before the slaughter, the combatants—some as young as 12—are given ornate costumes and literally paraded through the capital city (which seems to lack not at all for any resources), where they are interviewed by the cloying Games host (Stanley Tucci.) Katniss finds sympathetic allies in her official clothier Cinna (Lenny Kravitz), and alcoholic combat mentor Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) who apparently survived the Games himself, decades ago.Peeta is strong of arm but otherwise unconvinced of his ability to survive the combat arena, a vast forest. Naturally, every inch of it is rigged with video cameras, which broadcast even the most intimate of moments to the national audience. 'Winning sponsors' can occasionally get strategically delivered supplies to combatants. Regardless, dozens of technicians in an operations room actively work equipment that manipulates the environment, causing fires and conjuring giant dogs to terrorize combatants lest they become too good at surviving (similar string-pulling tactics drove the plot of Cabin in the Woods.) Behind the curtains is Crane (Wes Bentley), an executive producer of sorts who serves at the pleasure of the President (Donald Sutherland.) Embodying the ire of recent real-life political protests, Sutherland's leader knows the status quo he defends is immoral, and he is fully dedicated to maintaining its stark class divisions, with the games as its primary wedge. Katniss's plucky charm threatens to rock the boat.As executed by director Gary Ross, the film functions as an extrapolation of Shirley Jackson's short story 'The Lottery' and Golding's youth-gone-feral Lord of the Flies. Genre viewers may also recall elements of The Running Man and Logan's Run. The original Games novel was the first in a trilogy by author Suzanne Collins. If this first filmed adaptation is an indicator, the saga is off to a good start.",8,1,5,12 August 2012
Fast & Furious 6," Action Franchise Isn't Out of Gas Yet
","Action Franchise Isn't Out of Gas Yet Fast & Furious 6, as the title implies, is the sixth installment in the long-running action film series. Viewers should put on their seat belts and get ready for over two hours worth of joyriding. Vehicular mayhem never looked this good—so good, in fact, the producers apparently felt compelled to tag a disclaimer on the reel before the credits begin to roll. The film series started out as a vehicle (pun intended) for then-burgeoning action actor Vin Diesel (an apropos surname given the film setting). Since the first film premiered in 2001, it has grown to encompass several more co-stars in its subsequent sequels, leading into its current incarnation as a multicultural ensemble of drag-racing avengers.This time around, Diesel's Dominic Toretto and former adversary-turned-brother-in-law Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) are visited by globetrotting Interpol agent Hobbs (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) and presented with the proverbial offer they can't refuse: Letty (Michelle Hernandez), a heretofore deceased member of Toretto's crew, was recently seen helping out internationally-wanted criminal Shaw (Luke Evans). Shaw's team of outlaws use similar car-heavy tactics to pull off their heists, and so if Toretto's squad can beat them at their own game, a full pardon—and a reunion with Letty—is the reward. So the Fast & Furious team comes back again for one last job.The object of Shaw's affection is the film's MacGuffin: a computer database that can disable military security systems. It's fair to say, however, that this is entirely irrelevant to the film, as this screen franchise has built its brand on wilder-than-impossible stunt sequences and the interplay between Toretto's team: chatterbox Roman (Tyrese Gibson), gizmo guru Tej (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges), laid-back Han (Sung Kang) and tough-girl Gisele (Gal Gadot). Another tag-along this time is Hobb's right-hand agent Riley (Gina Carano), who gets to showcase her real-life UFC fighting skills in several confrontations.This is one of the best comic-book films of the year that aren't based on a comic (screenplay credit goes to Chris Morgan). Despite the relatively threadbare plot (and settings that hip-hop from Moscow to Los Angeles to London and more), director Justin Lin keeps everything from being the flailing mess that it might otherwise be in lesser hands. Sweeping, wide-camera views of urban cityscapes and chasm-spanning bridges help add to the spectacle, and the climax is as exhilarating as it is shamelessly over-the-top. If the epilogue is any indicator, the close-ups of gear-shifting and revving engines definitely haven't ended.Rating: A-",10,5,7,25 May 2013
Elf," Will Ferrell Anchors Modern Christmas Fable
","'Elf' is a Christmas-themed comedy starring Will Ferrell. Ferrell plays Buddy, a human who, as a baby, accidentally crawled into Santa Claus' (Ed Asner) toy sack and upon discovery is adopted by an elf (Bob Newhart, playing a version of his harried TV personas).One fateful day, Buddy is told the truth of his parentage, and decides to travel to New York City to find his real father. While Buddy's biological mom is deceased, it turns out Buddy's biological father is Walter, a high-ranking editor at a book publishing firm. Walter has since married and has a preteen son. He's totally incredulous and annoyed at this goofy, grown man claiming to be his son. After several hijinks, Walter grudgingly accepts that Buddy is the real deal, but that doesn't make life with him any easier.Buddy's undaunted Christmas-minded mentality makes him an annoyance to most around him. He finds work at a department store where he falls in love with a coworker (Zooey Deschanel). Buddy's quest leads to several funny sequences as he gets to know his dad and the various people around him.Director Jon Favreau ('Iron Man', 'Swingers') lets Ferrell do his shtick but the narrative is held together very well. Some of the actors are mild caricatures but they manage not to overdo it, since virtually everyone is playing it straight compared to Ferrell's Buddy. Ferell plays Buddy as a man-child who is relentlessly positive, despite all the grumpiness that he encounters in the Big City. Look for amusing supporting parts by Faizon Love, Peter Dinklage, Artie Lange and Andy Richter.Since the film has no real villain, it allows the relationships to be developed without an arbitrary 'bad guy' foil to overcome by the end. In an era where original Christmas holiday films are frequently run of the mill, 'Elf' stands out as a charmer. It's endearing without being overly saccharine.",8,0,0,16 December 2014
Captain America: The First Avenger," Captain America has star spangled Action
","Captain America has Star Spangled ActionCaptain America: The First Avenger is the first major motion picture based on the venerable Marvel Comics superhero character that first debuted in print over 70 years ago. Since then, there have been largely forgettable cross-media interpretations, including a 1940s movie serial and an aborted attempt at a television series in the late 70s that left two television films in its wake. With the power of Marvel Studios (now wholly owned by Disney and partnering with Paramount Films for distribution), Marvel attempts to return the luster to its onetime flagship hero that matches his mighty shield. Here, Chris Evans (Fantastic Four, Cellular) plays heroic shrimp Steve Rogers, who in 1942 wants to enlist in the military but is determined to be a 4-F. Still, the little guy has heart, as displayed when he keeps confronting local bully. His gumption impresses military scientist Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) and gruff Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones). They put him through the paces of boot camp, and finally reveal that he's the perfect test subject for their 'super soldier serum'—if it works (this shouldn't be a spoiler) then Steve's musculature and reflexes will be boosted to virtual perfection. Alas, the experiment's aftermath has a tragic end, which poises newly buff Steve to be the sole super-soldier for the Allied Forces—thus, 'Captain America' is born. Soon, he is pitted against the nefarious Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving), aka the Red Skull—an ambitious Nazi scientist who heads up 'Hydra', a super-science-weapons division of the Nazi army. Schmidt searches for an ancient artifact of power, called the 'tesseract', allegedly giving its wielder the power of the Nordic gods themselves. Heady stuff, this. The film's remaining supporting cast is capable, including Sebastian Stan as Cap's best friend Bucky Barnes and Hayley Atwell as British agent (and nominal love interest) Peggy Carter. The script, credited to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, features an anti-ironic sensibility here, being fairly straightforward in its depiction of patriotism and earnest heroism as exemplified by Cap. This could have easily diverted into self-satire or camp, but the filmmakers, including director Joe Johnston (Jurassic Park 3, the Rocketeer), wisely avoid this. Presumably to keep its comic-book-reality credentials intact, the movie plays fast and loose with the fictional history it represents (the Red Skull's Hydra troops feature no swastika iconography, and Cap's Howling Commandos team is racially integrated without a blink.) Still, the period designs are convincing enough, including a nod to Frankenstein with the Super Soldier laboratory. Captain America is poised to be the first in a franchise of solo adventures as well as the introduction to the character's featured role in next year's The Avengers. Time will tell whether Cap regains his former fan-favorite glory: his stalwart shtick may seem quaint compared to brooding avengers like Batman and Wolverine. Still, the film gets enough right to stand out from the crowd and in a time of political contention provides plenty of flag-friendly good will.",9,35,61,11 August 2011
Man of Steel," Edgy 'Man of Steel' Sharpest Superman Yet
","Movie Remixes Superman Legend with Engaging Results Rating: A- Man of Steel is the latest feature film to focus on the comic-book character Superman, who celebrates his 75th 'birthday' in 2013. The film is directed by Zach Snyder ('300', 'Sunday Punch') and produced by Christopher Nolan of the recent 'Dark Knight' Batman film series. The film follows some 7 years after the most recent cinema interpretation, 2006's Superman Returns. In Man of Steel, the filmmakers intend to revision the mythology of Superman—and in large part, they succeed.Some of the basics of the legend of Superman (portrayed by native Briton Henry Cavill) are intact—sent to Earth in a spaceship from the dying planet Krypton as a baby, adopted in anonymity by a Kansas couple who raised him with Heartland values—but from there, the hero's journey to become Superman is a far more ponderous—and tumultuous—than past screen depictions.The audience is selectively exposed to segments of young Clark Kent's life (frequently in flashback): performing heroic rescues in secret, being admonished by his adoptive dad Jonathan (Kevin Costner, who along with Diane Lane as wife Martha portray the senior Kents as protective moral beacons.) By the time biological dad Jor-El (Russell Crowe) is resurrected as a hologram, 33 years have passed in Clark's life (a nod to Biblical subtext) and a crisis occurs that forces the last son of Krypton to reveal himself to the world. It's at this point that the film's heretofore moderate pace becomes fairly relentless.The film's antagonist is General Zod (Michael Shannon, who wisely demurs any temptation to go camp). Seething with conquer-lust, Zod and his crew of outcast Kryptonians (they managed to escape Krypton's implosion) have chosen Earth as the place to restart Kryptonian society. That most of Earth's existing population would be wiped out by atmosphere-machines is treated with matter-of-fact disinterest. Obviously, the newly christened (and costumed) Superman cannot allow this, and the ensuing fight has literally global consequences.Superman's traditional supporting cast is pared down slightly: intrepid reporter and super-love interest Lois Lane is here (Amy Adams), still with a knack for covering dangerous stories, but thankfully with none of the goofy cluelessness that defined the character for much of her history. She also serves as her own photographer, obliquely commenting on the current state of the newspaper business (poor Jimmy Olsen; maybe he runs a blog now). Daily Planet chief editor Perry White sports a stud earring for the first time (the always reliable Laurence Fishburne), and is understandably hesitant at first to publish Lane's story about an alien visitor. Cavill's Superman and Adams' Lois do have palpable screen chemistry, though that romance blossoms between them in the midst of an alien invasion.Ironically, DC Comics' corporate rival Marvel seems to have influenced this latest Superman venture. Marvel is long-known for featuring superheroes that spend more time being misunderstood than being lauded, and this Superman is treated by the American military as just as much a threat as Zod. The death of a key character by mid-film is also given a Marvel-esque touch, putting Superman at the center of a fateful choice that informs his later life. Cavill plays the near-invulnerable Superman as near-crippled by a lifetime of existential angst: he's determined to help humanity but loathe to get close to anyone.Where Superman Returns stressed romance, Man of Steel stresses (plenty of CGI-abetted) action. Superman and his foes leap for miles, fly into orbit, and throw punches that send each other through mountaintops, skyscrapers, and in one of several product placement asides, an IHOP restaurant. In this regard, the scale of combat taken for granted in the comics is finally rendered on film, quite convincingly.Regarding the behind-the-scenes role players, the filmmakers' intent was clearly to break ties with past screen depictions. Where Superman Returns openly paid tribute to the Alexander Salkind-produced/Richard Donner-directed films, the set design for the Kryptonian society and ships seems to owe a debt to Ridley Scott's Alien and David Lynch's Dune. Screenplay credit goes to David S. Goyer (who shares co-story credit with producer Nolan), who imbues the narrative with touches of post-9/11 anxieties, and even manages to get away with completely ignoring kryptonite as a plot device. Even the traditional 'love triangle' between Superman/Clark and Lois is upended early on in the proceedings.Overall, Man of Steel manages to succeed as the first post-millennial Superman film to capture the zeitgeist of today. This Superman makes no bones about his American upbringing but blanches at being perceived as an arm of American policy ('I'm here to help, but it has to be on my own terms,' says Superman to a U.S. military general.) Commercially, the presumed success of this film is reputed to pave the way for not just its own sequel but the introduction of Superman's super-contemporaries in the Justice League. Whether the latter happens is up to Warner Bros. Studio executives—whose whims can kill a film faster than a speeding bullet—but with the same creative team in place, Superman's new adventures should continue to soar.",9,0,1,16 June 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Two Generations of X-Men Anchor their Latest Adventure
","'X-Men: Days of Future Past' is the latest film in 20th Century Fox's enduring franchise based on the Marvel Comics team of superheroes. The plot hinges on the team's main tough guy Wolverine (Hugh Jackman, fresh off last year's solo outing as the character) being sent back in time to stop robots from taking over the world. An assortment of X-Men movie alumni make calculated appearances throughout the era-spanning film.The film begins in a dystopian future, where security robots called Sentinels have gone rogue and laid waste to much of human society and the mutant population alike. As a voice-over from the film's trailer proclaims, 'They started out targeting mutants then they started targeting everybody.' The status of most world governments is unclear but apparently the Sentinels have a global mandate, as what remains of the X-Men have become nomadic renegades. Even longtime mutant-rights rival Magneto (Ian McKellen) is now a de facto member. The ragtag outfit (including Halle Berry as weather-mistress Storm) travels the world, searching for a way to stop the Sentinels while trying to avoid capture or execution. The latest incarnation of the killing machines have the ability to create perfect counter-measures for most attacks, so even the mutants' considerable powers are frequently stymied in combat. Article Photo Wolverine (Hugh Jackman, center) must bridge the chasm between Xavier (James McAvoy, left) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender, right) in order to save the future in 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' A strangely resurrected Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart, whose character was killed in X-Men: The Last Stand) returns as the moral leader of the team. He's strategized a Hail-Mary stunt to hopefully end the genocide and stop the Sentinels once and for all. His idea? Just have Wolverine time-travel 40 years into the past and stop the assassination of a key political figure. The powers of Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) help send Wolverine's mind back into his 1973 body. (Wolverine looks the same as before, thanks to his longevity powers—but his claws aren't yet fused with a steel alloy, so he's only slightly less dangerous to tick off.) But even when abetted by mutant powers, things are never as easy as planned. In the past, younger Xavier (James McAvoy) has abandoned running his boarding school for mutant children. Having retreated into alcohol, he spends most days un-sober and embittered about the creeping social animosity toward mutants. Meanwhile, the younger Magneto (Michael Fassbender) is imprisoned hundreds of feet beneath the Pentagon.The would-be assassin that Wolverine is tasked to stop is Raven, a.k.a. Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), whose shape-shifting allows her to imitate anyone. She's gradually working her way to getting rid of scientist Bolivar Trask (Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage). Convinced that mutants are an invasive species, Trask's military-hardware company builds the Sentinels as the answer to containing 'the mutant problem.' The grand unveiling of the Sentinels is planned to take place in the midst of Vietnam War peace talks. As such, even President Richard Nixon (Mark Camacho) is brought into the plot.Only Nixon could go to China, and thus only the brawler Wolverine could be sent to play peacemaker between the estranged Xavier and Magneto as the dawn of the Sentinels nears. The plot is punctuated by yet another threat in Major William Stryker (Josh Helman), an army scientist using mutants as guinea pigs.Taking into account the vast ensemble cast, Jackman, McAvoy, Fassbender and Lawrence get the most screen time and director Bryan Singer manages to get substantive mileage out of their respective performances. Audiences will believe in the alternating mutual bitterness and empathy between Charles, Magneto and Raven's highly dysfunctional— and volatile — surrogate family, with Jackman's Logan and Nicholas Hoult's Hank as harried (and hairy) caretakers. The future X-Men have a smaller role to play here compared to their 70s counterparts, but the fight sequences with the Sentinels are top notch. New characters Quicksilver (Evan Peters in a very memorable turn) and Blink (Bingbing Fan), in particular, have some nifty visual tricks.Perhaps inadvertently, the filmmakers (including director Singer and co-writer Simon Kinberg) manage to tap into contemporary concerns about drone-driven surveillance and warfare. Also of note is that the future X-Men team essentially takes on the role of terrorists—from the robots' point of view, anyway. The comics' pop-allegory about social tolerance (or the lack thereof) is somewhat obscured by dizzying fight scenes and laser bursts, but Days of Future Past is still a highly competent action fantasy.",10,13,21,31 May 2014
Hidden Figures," Hidden Figures Exposes Unsung American Heroes
","'Hidden Figures', directed by Theodore Malfi and based on the book of the same name, is a historical drama highlighting the struggles and accomplishments of three African American women who were employed by the NASA space program in the 1960s. The social backdrop of the narrative takes place early in the Kennedy administration, and Jim Crow laws and customs still dominated most of the United States—even in (federal) government employment, discrimination was still the standard, as the Langley Virginia NASA campus had separate work facilities (and bathroom facilities) for white and black employers. Octavia Spencer is Dorothy Vaughan: she leads a team of numbers-crunchers who contribute to the math-heavy physics and engineering problems that NASA is trying to solve in order to compete with the Soviet Union in space exploration. Taraji Henson is Katherine Johnson, who gets a promotion of sorts to work with the all-white team under Kevin Costner's gruff but fair Al Harrison. She's a backup calculator to Jim Parson's Paul Stafford (a kind of vaguely less grating version of his Sheldon character on Big Bang Theory). Janelle Monae is Mary Jackson, who pines for an engineer's role, but finds herself stymied by the racism of administrators who seemingly invent new hoops for her to jump through.An intriguing subplot involves an early-generation IBM computer being installed on the campus: back then, a mechanical computer literally took up an entire room—but once installed, no one seems to know what to do with it—which Dorothy takes as her cue to learn Fortran and teach it to her charges. All the ladies have children, and are churchgoers. The film wisely shows the family interactions, and the warm relationships therein, in stark contrast to the predominately white work environment at NASA, where condescending managers take their black workers for granted. The film eschews any outright vicious depictions of racial confrontations and the oppression of the era. A police encounter is treated with comic effect, as is one of the ladies browsing in the 'White' area of a library. The 'n-word' is never used by anyone. Most of the adversaries aren't broadly drawn. The most tension in the film is reflected in a compelling monologue by Henson when her character is confronted about her lengthy bathroom breaks. Overall, this is a feel good movie, and gives due respect to a trio of Americans who contributed greatly to the sciences and who were . Astronauts like John Glenn (here played by Glen Powell) got to be the face of NASA to most of the public and the world. There were legitimately hundreds of employees of other kinds whose work was unheralded—but due in great part to the racial discrimination of the era they survived in, 'erasure' threatened to marginalize the accomplishments of Katherine, Mary and Dorothy. 'Hidden Figures' makes sure that no one forgets their names again.",9,2,8,15 January 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Space Opera Explodes with Action and Humor from Marvel Studios
","'Guardians of the Galaxy' is the latest film from Marvel Studios, and is loosely based on characters that have existed largely in the fringes of Marvel Comics from the 1960s until the present day. The film is effectively Marvel's first stab at space opera-- ironically, Disney now also owns LucasFilm, making the 'Star Wars' franchise a sister property-- in any case, this dark-horse film is approached like an indie epic with better special effects, and it works superbly.Directed by James Gunn (who also co-writes with Nicole Perlman), the film's plot concerns a ragtag band of malcontents, all thrown together by circumstance, none of whom guess that they are bound to become heroic renegades in a distant galaxy far from Earth. Chris Pratt is the self-described 'star lord', Peter Quill: an Earth boy by birth (at least, his mother is an Earthling; his dad's origins are deliberately obscured for now). He spent about 10 years growing up in Missouri, only to see his mother die from cancer. In an emotional rage, he flees from the hospital and-- wait for it-- gets kidnapped by space pirates. Over 20 years later, Quill is a professional thief, seeking out various curiosities that will bring him big bucks (or credits or whatever money standards he deals with.) Getting captured on his latest caper, he finds himself forced to deal with the company of Gamora- (Zoe Saldana)-- a professional assassin sent by a galactic warlord; Drax (Dave Bautista), is a bruiser of ill-repute who openly vows to kill the space overlord Ronan (Lee Pace) for the death of his family; Rocket (voice of Cooper) is a dwarf-sized raccoon and a career thief/bounty hunter in his own right; Rocket's single-phrase-uttering best friend (and parallel character for Chewbacca) is Groot (voice of Diesel), an intelligent tree creature whose 'I am groot' statement is his only dialogue.The MacGuffin that these criminals-turned-rebel heroes are seeking is an 'Orb'- a baseball-shaped knick-knack containing a gem that spews purple energy when touched and has a tendency to blow things up.Ronan the Accuser is the main villain here.. He sends horde after horde of crazier bad folks after the Guardians, while occasionally standing off with Thanos (Josh Brolin.)The film has some other key cameos and bit parts, including Glenn Close and John C. Reilly as Xandarian executives of the Nova Corps- a peacekeeping army and a close analog to 'Starfleet'.The interplay between the characters is more dialogue driven than most of these films tend to be, and the actors inhabit the roles in a believable way, despite the obvious absurdity that defines the proceedings. Vintage top 40 pop music from the 1970s and 80s prominently figures into the plot throughout the film.The final battle is lengthier than you might think, but it has a satisfying-- and heartbreaking conclusion, with the sacrifice of a team member.The film ends on a note that signals more adventures are to come. Based on the execution by the filmmakers, a continuation of the Guardians' saga is very welcome.After the stark commercial failure of the Disney-backed 'John Carter of Mars', this project could have been stillborn, especially considering that with the exception of Ms. Saldana, none of the human principals were major box office draws on their own, and the voice-acting contributions of Cooper and Diesel as a talking raccoon and tree, respectively, could have simply been written off as a cash-grab. The script is more intelligent than viewers likely expect it to be, and the pace is brisk without feeling rushed. All in all, the film is a solid good time from Marvel.",9,1,4,27 November 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," 'Age of Ultron' Smashes, Bashes and Thrills
","'The Avengers: Age of Ultron' is officially the second 'Marvel's The Avengers' movie, but nonetheless the 10th film in the ongoing Marvel Studios' 'Marvel Cinematic Universe'. All of the no less than six principal characters from the first team film are here, and screenwriter - director Joss Whedon does an admirable job of juggling them all for a mostly cohesive fantasy thriller.The movie's plot opens with the team invading a terrorist stronghold, where renegade scientist Baron Strucker has been using an Asgardian artifact to conduct experiments on locals to turn them into superhuman agents of HYDRA. (This is the big-bad terror outfit that was officially felled in 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier', but inevitably, these sorts of bad-folk social clubs have any number of splinter cells.) Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) retrieves Scepter of Loki and figures out that it can jumpstart his team of robotic peacekeeping sentries. He works on the secret 'Ultron' project with Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) with the hope of creating a manageable robot army and allow their friends to retire from the superhero gig. (The particulars of what their health insurance and retirement plans might be are never dealt with, but would be intriguing for future filmmakers.) After several false starts, Ultron comes alive in secret, but apparently some bugs made his programming a little 'off' and he wakes up angry. REALLY angry. '2001: A Space Odyssey' introduced HAL-9000 as an intelligent computer program that gradually becomes murderous over the course of months. Ultron leapfrogs the slow-burn angle and basically is homicidal from his first day of self-awareness. It's implied that mankind's history of war and oppression irrevocably convince Ultron that humans are the ultimate invasive species.After 'multiplying like Catholic rabbits' (quoth Samuel Jackson's patch-eyed Nick Fury), Ultron's legion of self-created robots starts invading world cities, looking for rare metals that can help him create a more advanced body as well as the super-weapon that will help him-- wait for it-- destroy humanity.Naturally, the good guys can't have any of that. Soon, Captain America (Chris Evans) and the rest of the team are launching assaults to pull the plug on the rogue robot. At least for a while, they manage to be stymied by the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), two orphans of Eastern Europe's 1990s war conflicts. Olsen's character has psychic abilities that expose people's greatest fears, creating much of the angst that weighs heavily on the protagonists. In comparison, Taylor-Johnson's character is simply super-fast; a somewhat more mundane power in comparison, though he manages to make an emotional impact later in the film.Surprisingly, romantic tension in the film comes from an unexpected coupling- Ruffalo's Banner and Johannson's Widow (aka Natasha Romanov). It's a Beauty and the Beast conceit that is thankfully given several lingering scenes of explanation in between the literally explosive goings on in the main narrative. Ruffalo's Banner has a tragic arc, desperate for an intimate relationship but relentlessly haunted by the threat of a Hulk rampage. Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye is revealed to have a wife and children living off-grid, and some downtime on his family's farm gives not only his character some needed spotlight (he spent most of the last film hypnotized) but also the other characters as well. Viewers would do well to pay attention to these scenes in particular, as they seem to sow seeds for developments in future adventures.In keeping with Marvel's comics traditions, the heroes argue and fight among themselves until the moment of clarity comes for all of them who the real enemy is. This is facilitated by Paul Bettany as a new ally to the team, born from the efforts of several members. Other Avengers allies seen in some of the solo movies show up here as well, also hinting at future developments.The climax is lengthy enough to be satisfying for its action scenes but also comes across as somewhat drawn-out in its execution. Look for the sacrifice of a key character at an unexpected moment, to the filmmakers' credit.All of the actors manage to have sufficient spotlight- Downey's smart-aleck Tony Stark continues to be his defining modern role, Chris Evans' morally-centered Captain America has taken formal reins of leadership of the team, distrusts the notion of being at war with everyone and no one at the same time-- and is still mindful of bad language in mixed company. Chris Hemsworth's Thor has gotten more used to life among mortals.Ultron is given a droll flair by 'The Blacklist''s James Spader. Spader as Ultron is enveloped in CGI animation (via motion-capture technology) just as Ruffalo is so enveloped for his stints as the Hulk. While the actor's real body is unseen, his personality makes intriguing what could have been a very generic role. On an interesting side note, pioneering motion-capture actor Andy Serkis ('Lord of the Rings', 'Planet of the Apes') has a bit part here as an arms dealer, sans any CGI.The film will make believers of this particular kind of action spectacle. Joss Whedon is given the herculean (Thor-ean?) task of making comic book stories like the Avengers look real enough to be appreciated by comics laypeople but fantastic enough for the fanboys and girls who are steeped in the lore. Here, he succeeds. It's not a perfect film, but like its protagonists, flaws are part of its appeal and the ending promises a bold new direction for the saga.",9,1,6,3 May 2015
The Wolverine," Wolverine in the Land of the Rising Sun
","Feature: The Wolverine Studio: 20th Century Fox The Wolverine is Hugh Jackman's fifth feature-length outing as the razor-clawed Marvel Comics superhero. This time around, the brooding avenger is caught up in a plot involving corrupt industrialists, politicians and organized crime in Japan. The movie combines the seemingly disparate genres of comic-book action with film noir with self-assurance and a sense of respect for both.The film opens with the nuclear bombing of Nagasaki during World War II. Here, Jackman's Logan—the Wolverine—is a prisoner of war isolated in a deep pit. Japanese soldier Shingen (Ken Yamamura) frees him, only to be rescued himself by Wolverine as the pit becomes an impromptu bomb shelter. Decades later, an almost completely hirsute Logan— having nightmares from his days as an X-Man—is living as a hermit in the Canadian Yukon (his feral mutant instincts apparently endear him to local fauna like grizzly bears.) A confrontation in a bar is interrupted by feisty swordswoman Yukio (Rila Fukushima), who brings an offer from the elderly Shingen (Hiroyuki Sanada), now a billionaire tech giant in Japan.It seems Shingen is dying, and wants to offer his thanks to Logan for saving his life: Shingen claims to have developed a means to siphon Logan's mutant healing and longevity powers into himself— giving Logan an end to his 'curse' of outliving everyone he loves. Inevitably, in Logan's world, nothing's that simple. Logan barely gets a bad-night's sleep (thanks to Svetlana Khodchenkova's henchwoman Viper) before he has to deal head-on with Yakuza gangsters who want Shingen's granddaughter Mariko (a luminous Tao Okamato) dead.Complicating matters is the fact that Mariko's dad (Haruhiko Yamanouchi) and her prosecutor fiancé (Brian Tee) may be in on the murder plot. Worst of all, Logan's healing power seems to be failing on its own. Wolverine's newfound vulnerability is felt through much of the film, as he now winces and limps with every gunshot, knife and sword wound that is leveled his way (blood, both literal and figurative, heavily informs the narrative.)Walk the Line's James Mangold directs the film (the final script is credited to Mark Bomback and Scott Frank), and the filmmakers give Wolverine the solo adventure he deserves. The romance-on-the-run between Logan and Mariko is handled admirably—she thinks him an uncouth gaijin at first, but comes to love the gruff brawler with a heart of gold. The film's setting avoids fetishizing its Far East backdrop (though a fetish motel is visited) and gives its supporting characters deeply-felt—if severely misguided—motivations driven by adherence to tradition and self-sacrifice.The Wolverine may or may not be the last appearance by the character—witness the mid-credits epilogue—but if this is Jackman's final bow as Wolverine, he was given an engaging send-off.Rating: A-",9,4,10,12 August 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Batman v Superman Action Packed but Overwrought
","Batman v Superman: Action-Packed but Overwrought Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is a sprawling, generally enjoyable mess. The film, directed by Zack Snyder (from a script by Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer), is the official follow-up to 2013's Man of Steel. It's also a setup for the soon-to-lense Justice League superhero team-up movie. The main plot of this feature is self-explanatory: It's a clash between DC Comics' biggest icons. The internal logic of the plot— much like many of the comics that inspired it— is kind of a moot point. Let's get ready to rumble.The estimable Henry Cavill (2015's The Man from U.N.C.L.E.) returns as Superman, and here he's a much more polarizing figure in the world (and his home country) than in previous screen depictions. Forget the patriotic exemplar role models of George Reeves and Christopher Reeve. (Fans probably won't have much difficulty forgetting Brandon Routh.) An early sequence finds him intervening in an African warlord's regime; while some lives are immediately saved (read: Lois Lane), there is soon public testimony about how the regime's loyalists retaliated against locals. In drastic contrast to previous depictions of the Man of Steel, Superman's actions are seen as fraught with indirect human casualties. Cavill's Superman is ponderous, brooding, and increasingly concerned with the vigilantism of Batman in nearby Gotham City.This Batman— here played by Academy Award-winner Ben Affleck— is middle-aged and bitter after apparently having waged a 20-year war on crime in Gotham by the time of Superman's first public outing in Man of Steel. In that film, the onslaught of criminals from Superman's home planet left much of Metropolis devastated (featuring plenty of thinly-veiled allegory to 9/11). Bruce Wayne owned an office building that was leveled during the chaos, and it is on Superman that Wayne places the blame. It's this angle that sets up Batman in a dual role— that of co-hero and as a secondary villain.Lead villain Lex Luthor is portrayed by The Social Network's Jesse Eisenberg as a twitchy, candy-munching sociopath. That this Lex is also a Generation Y technology mogul means that he ditches Gene Hackman's tailored suit and ascot for casual jackets, cartoon-monkey T-shirts and sneakers. This Lex isn't content with being rich; he's an insecure xenophobe who sees Superman's presence, fairly or unfairly, as a living reminder of his comparative impotence. In true comic-book villain rationale, that means the alien has to go— and if it means manipulating Batman into doing the dirty work, then it's killing two birds with one kryptonite stone.The leading women in this film offer mixed results. Wonder Woman, played by Gal Gadot (recently of The Fast & the Furious films), has little dialogue and less to do with the overall tale than viewers might assume. Still, she makes an impression in the film's climax. Meanwhile, Amy Adams' Lois Lane is more substantively interspersed in the story. Having long ago learned Clark Kent's secret identity, she now worries that his adventures as Superman— now facing serious scrutiny from the U.S. government— puts an untenable strain on their relationship. Adams continues to convincingly update the role of Superman's plucky girlfriend— but the filmmakers still can't resist putting her in traditional distressed-damsel scenarios.Supporting characters get shortchanged in this narrative. Jeremy Irons as Batman's loyal butler Alfred gets to wax wise with his boss/surrogate son, while offering prescient warnings about the risk of obsessive vendettas. Meanwhile, Daily Planet editor Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) mostly gets to offer expository dialogue to reporters Clark and Lois about the woes of the newspaper industry. They're both kind of wasted here; hopefully there's more for them to do in the next installment.The film suffers somewhat because of the need to foreshadow future events. A lengthy nightmare sequence (technically, one of two) will probably just confuse casual viewers unhip to Justice League lore. Presumed future members of said League also have cameos here. The writer seemed to notice at least two or three false endings by the time of the (really) last shot. A shocking development in the climax may confuse some viewers regarding sequel possibilities, but it's likely all part of a plan.Batman v Superman is almost best viewed as 'Justice League .5'. The first-ever cinematic assembly of this superhero team (and the immediately pending Wonder Woman feature) is bound to continue the momentum of the recently inaugurated DC Entertainment slate of films from Warner Bros. Studios. Still, based on the themes of this film, it looks like Batman and company are inhabiting a distinctly depressing, catastrophe-prone, paranoia-driven world. It's going to take more than a team of adventurers to save it; it's going to need a team of counselors.Rating: B",8,3,7,1 April 2016
Da 5 Bloods," 'Da 5 Bloods' is Spike Lee's Magnum Opus
","'Da 5 Bloods' is an action drama highlighting a fateful reunion with a quartet of Vietnam War veterans in modern-day Vietnam. The cast is led by Delroy Lindo, Chadwick Boseman, Jonathan Majors, Isiah Whitlock, Clarke Peters and Norm Lewis.This film explores the broken promises for Black American soldiers after their war experiences. 'Miracle at St. Anna' was one of Lee's first to tackle a story that mostly takes place well outside the United States. Given his initial pedigree as a 'New York City Stories' auteur, this is an obvious change of pace, but it is well worth more than one viewing.Four of the veterans reunite in Ho Chi Minh City to attempt to find the remains of fallen soldier/field leader 'Stormin Norman' (Boseman). What neither the US or Vietnam State Departments know is that the four men also plan to find a hidden trunk full of gold that was lost in a CIA plane crash in the Vietnamese Jungle back during their original tour of duty.All four surviving men have been scarred by the war to varying degrees. The most deeply disturbed is Paul (Lindo), who in the latest manifestation of his bitterness and discontent has become an unabashed supporter of President Donald Trump: this makes him the object of caustic ribbing by his buddies, but Paul is resolute: He feels absolutely cheated of his due respect and reward for his bodily and mental sacrifice: both as a soldier and as a black citizen enduring Civil Rights-era turmoil and social tumult.To varying degrees, all of Paul's friends agree: Eddie, Melvin and Otis. Paul's adult son David is a surprise, and initially unwelcome tag-along: he wants to finally find a way to bond with his long-estranged father, but Paul isn't about to make it easy.The explorations of these men provide an intriguing alternative point of view for 2020 audiences: Vietnam-based dramas have been produced for decades, but scarcely few have done a deep dive into the point of view of what Black soldiers went through, much less how they fared in the years after the war.The cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel is top-notch. Lee's direction is assured; the visual atmosphere is alternately cool, warm or hot and intense in other parts. There are four credited writers, including original writers Paul De Meo and Danny Bilson.Some of the scenes linger longer than they should. Some of the tribute/easter-egg dialogue will be obvious to people who are familiar with certain war films or heist films. Delroy Lindo should get major acting award nominations for his performance. His Paul is a firestorm of macho belligerence and deep emotional woundedness all wound-up in a man who feels abandoned and guilty. Clark Peters should get supporting actor nominations. Maybe the conceit of using the same actors to play their younger selves is off-putting for some, but this viewer managed to get over it.Given the already 2-hour-plus running time of the film, I don't know that there was time to go deeper into the philosophy of how people of color can be used as tools of white-driven colonialism and hyper-capitalism against other people of color and indigenous communities, the influence of Black-derived pop culture in Asian countries (Motown played at nightclubs, or even modern K-Pop music) or the contemporary contexts of Black-Asian relations in the United States. Paul's confrontation with a fellow trying to sell him a chicken updates the spat between Bill Nunn's Radio Raheem and the Korean-born shopkeepers in 'Do the Right Thing'. Paul's occasional rants about 'illegals' and the rest of the crew's attempts to calm him down is about as far as it goes.Whatever the technical faults of a director like Spike Lee, he has earned his right for due consideration in taking on a conceptually risky project. 'Da 5 Bloods' delivers the gold, but at a cost.",10,2,8,21 June 2020
The Cabin in the Woods," Blood and Lore: Cabin is a Revisionist Take on Scary Films
","In the 1985 film 'Fright Night', Roddy MacDowall's hammy veteran of vampire films makes a self-aware observation that informs the proceedings of 2011's 'Cabin in the Woods': 'Nobody wants to see vampire killers... or vampires (anymore)... Apparently all they want to see are demented madmen running around in ski-masks, hacking up young virgins.' If someone unexposed to horror films from the past 35 years or so were to watch a marathon of several of these films back to back--and let's say none of them were sequels--how many would it take before he or she began to predict what's going to happen next? For an American film audience that has by now endured the irony-heavy Scream franchise and the gloomily anti-ironic spate of 'torture porn' from directors like Eli Roth and others, can there truly be any genuine shocks in horror anymore? 'Cabin in the Woods' film attempts to answer that question with a wink and a nod.'Cabin' features five college-aged protagonists, each fitting a certain stock cliché to be found in assorted horror films. There's the jock and de facto leader (Chris Hemsworth), the dumb blonde (Anna Hutchison), the nerd (Jesse Williams, who also serves as his group's token minority), the druggie (Fran Kranz) and the nice girl (Kristin Connolly). The slight twist is, not all of the characters inhabit these roles from the get-go, but are manipulated into them.A creepy gas station attendant (is there any other kind in these films?) gives an oblique warning--to the students and the audience--as the quintet heads up to the titular cabin for a weekend of unsupervised fun. Before the film is over, threads from Deliverance, Friday the 13th, Ju-On/The Grudge and more are touched on in various depths. The Saw films, which are already on their seventh (or is that VIIth) installment, are also clipped for some thematic DNA.The film was co-written by Joss Whedon ('Marvel's The Avengers') and directed by Drew Goddard--the latter of whom wrote and directed several episodes of Whedon's 'Buffy' and 'Angel' TV series as well as the conspiracy-heavy TV drama Lost. Both collaborators bring a satirical sensibility to this horror entry. Cabin reveals its core conceit in its opening scenes (though less-knowing viewers may be hard-pressed to connect the dots early on), and so perhaps the film has less bite (pun intended) than it would have were it to wait until later. Still, the twists, when they happen, are more intriguing than draining, especially by the climax, which manages to be nihilistic and liberating at the same time.Cabin functions as a witty indictment and an apology of sorts for the clichés of contemporary horror cinema and the slasher subgenre in particular. Depending on how cynical the viewer is, the only way to really ruin this experience would be to have a sequel.",9,0,3,3 October 2015
Hustle & Flow," Excellent Examination of Urban Angst & Struggle
","complete spoilers contained--The film is produced by John Singleton, and written & directed by Craig Brewer. Terence Howard plays DJay, a Memphis pimp of middling means, who shares a ramshackle home with his three working girls: Lexus is the eldest, a part-time stripper whose toddler son also lives there; Nola is white and apparently DJay's main money-earner; mousy Shug is pregnant with DJay's baby. In his early 30's, DJay is having a mid-life crisis of sortshe's weary of spending his days pushing sex and nickel-bags of marijuana, but he doesn't know exactly what else he wants to do.A chance barter gets DJay a Reagan-era Casio keyboard, and he takes it as an omen to try and become a rap singer. Arnel (Isaac Hayes) is a sympathetic bar owner, who tells DJay that a Memphis local, Skinny Black (Ludacris) has recently become a mainstream rap star, and he's poised to have a 4th of July party in town. DJay swears he used to know the guy, and now he plans to record a demo tape to pass along to Black in time for the party.Soon, DJay rekindles a friendship with an old high school chum Key (Anthony Anderson)now married, Key's an audio engineer recording depositions at the city courthouse, and he becomes DJay's producer. They jerry-rig a recording studio in DJay's house, and along with vending machine-stocker/church organist Shelby (DJ Qualls) they set about to creating DJay's sound.All the actors do a good job; Howard is very convincing as DJay; despite his role in his relationship with his hookers, he's just as lost and desperate as they are. The film doesn't glorify the pimp lifestyle but instead offers a glimpse at the reality that probably exists for most people involved: DJay doesn't drive a new model Cadillac, but a beat-up early-80's sedan; he's dressed not in flamboyant suits, but casual gear. The casual brutality of that world is glimpsed when DJay kicks Lexus and her son out of the house, and when he prompts Nola to do a sex job in exchange for an expensive microphone.--Climax Spoilers-- DJay's ambitions increases the pressure not only on himself, but everyone around himLexus is constantly surly and snarly; Nola is increasingly antsy about turning tricks; Key's church-going wife is aghast at his newfound choice of friends. Eventually, DJay's group finish a song, 'Whoop That Trick'on cassetteand DJay prepares to approach Skinny Black at Arnel's bar. It isn't easyBlack is surrounded by a posse of boorish hangers-on, and it takes DJay offering Black a batch of high-end marijuana to break the ice.Unfortunately, Black turns out to be a drunken jerk, who ditches the demo tape in the restroom; when DJay finds it he beats him up, but then one of Black's henchman shows up, and a firefight gets startedDJay ends up doing some time. Key visits him, and lets him know what's been going on since then: Shug gave birth to a baby girl, and its clear that she's still holding a torch for DJay; Nola turned into DJay's defacto manager, shopping his song to assorted radio stations; as he's about to be released, his song finally hits the radio; even some correctional officers offer him their demo tape.

Furious 7," Furious 7 Blasts Trhough One Last Ride
","'Furious 7' is the seventh entry in Universal Studios' enduring 'The Fast & The Furious' movie franchise. The action film stars Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson and the late Paul Walker in what is his final on-screen performance. This latest and possibly final sequel in the series finds the Diesel-led team of drag-racing avengers facing off against two terrorists in a contest of firepower and horsepower.The globe-trotting adventure introduces Jason Statham as the film's primary antagonist, Deckard Shaw. Shaw, an ex-military assassin, vows revenge against Diesel's Dominic Toretto for putting Shaw's brother Owen in traction by the end of 'Fast Six'. (Or rather, at the beginning of this film; it was assumed Owen was vaporized by the end of the last movie. Luke Evans plays a near-corpse quite well, it must be said.) To telegraph Shaw's tough-guy bona fides to the audience, his introductory scene leaves the entire wing of a hospital in shambles. After the brutal sidelining of federal cop Hobbs (Johnson), Shaw's got his cross-hairs aimed at Toretto and his team, including Brian O'Connor (Walker), Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Chris Bridges) and amnesiac Letti (Michelle Rodriguez), all gathered by mysterious CIA rep Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell, seemingly in a nod to his own history as an action icon). Mr. Nobody wants Toretto's team to rescue a pretty computer hacker (Game of Thrones' Nathalie Emmanuel) from the clutches of yet another terrorist, Mose Jakande (played by Djimon Honsou); in exchange, a special computer-satellite chip she has access to will allow them to track down Shaw for a final showdown.The particular MacGuffin of this film is somewhat of a moot point; Shaw manages to somehow abruptly show up like Jaws the shark at inopportune times to assert his revenge as the heroes are trying to rescue someone or steal something. Director James Wan-- heretofore known for lensing horror films like Insidious and Saw-- is a newcomer to the franchise and capably abets the over-the-top sensibilities of the film series. In comparison to the first film's Southern California setting, the latest entry casually adds Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi to its list of exotic locales visited. Before the credits roll, viewers will be also exposed to not one but two games of chicken, a fleet of cars parachuting to a mountain road, a marauding helicopter, a remote-controlled drone, and a sports car soaring between three skyscrapers. Subtlety isn't a virtue in the 'Furious' universe.The acting performances are all on-point for the characters featured. Diesel's Toretto is all stoicism and bottled fury, punctuated by the occasional smart-aleck quip; Statham's Shaw is a cocky bastard who isn't above bringing an automatic rifle to a street fight; Johnson's Hobbs is a macho cowboy prone to spout testosterone-laced punchlines that would only be credible coming from The Rock. Sadly, he isn't in the film as much as he could be. Most of the film's comic relief comes from Gibson's motormouth Roman with Bridges' Tej as his tech-savvy foil. Rodriguez arguably has the most demanding character arc with her lingering amnesia, but its resolution is rather abrupt. Lastly, Walker's Brian is the level-headed heart of the team, but torn in adjusting to being a new dad and husband to Toretto's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster).Walker and a friend were tragically killed in a car accident before the film's primary photography was completed. Subsequently, his remaining segments were filmed using body doubles and computer-driven special effects. To the extent that the film series has already made heavy usage of stunt doubles and CGI enhancement, this is both par for the course and a curious commentary on the potential for posthumous acting performances in cinema. None but the most wizened (or cynical) of filmgoers can likely tell where the real Walker begins and ends. Still, occasional in-story comments about characters being 'tired of funerals' and Brian's lingering angst about being retired from the craziness of dodging bullets and leaping from moving vehicles casts a bittersweet pall over the proceedings. Screenwriter Chris Morgan's script regularly brings up family ties as the film and franchise's prominent theme. It works, albeit nominally, though these films are more about muscle cars (and musclemen) than philosophy. Bring popcorn, fasten your seat belts and enjoy this (alleged) last joyride from Diesel and company.",8,2,5,5 April 2015
