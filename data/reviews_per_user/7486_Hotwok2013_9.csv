Raiders of the Lost Ark," Wonderful Escapist Entertainment
","Raiders Of The Lost Ark is a movie that is in just about everyone's list of top ten favourite movies, & many people's top three. The first 10 minutes of the movie showing Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) in the Peruvian jungle in search of a golden statue is an absolute blockbuster of an opening. Back home teaching in his college in the USA, where he is a professor of archaeology, he learns about the Ark Of The Covenant from museum curator Dr. Marcus Brody (Denholm Eliot). Brody informs him of the power of the artefact ('An army carrying the Ark is invincible') & that Nazi Germany also is searching for it. So begins Indiana Jones quest for it. What follows may be somewhat far-fetched at times, but no-one could deny its marvellous escapist entertainment value. Director Steven Spielberg must have spent many of his boyhood hours at his local cinema showing Saturday matin√©e movies, because it shows in his Indiana Jones trilogy & many other of his films. He fully deserves his reputation as the king of modern-day escapist movies.",Null,1,2,10 December 2014
The Godfather: Part II," The greatest movie sequel ever made.
","'The Godfather Part 2' is that rarest of movies in that it surpasses a really brilliant first movie. Shown in flashbacks it shows the rise of the young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) in New York City & alternates forward to his son Michael (Al Pacino) who eventually succeeds him as head of the Corleone mafia family. De Niro & Pacino are two of the greatest movie actors of all time but I have to say that, to my mind, De Niro is just fantastic in his role. Great too is Robert Duvall as family lawyer & counsellor Tom Hagen. John Cazale who plays Michael's brother Fredo is also excellent. He had the misfortune to die of cancer at only 42 years of age but the good luck to appear in only five 1970's movies all of which are regarded as classics. For anyone who has never seen this movie do so at the first opportunity because there is no doubt it is one of the greatest, (some say THE greatest), movie ever made. As a piece of celluloid storytelling it remains unsurpassed.",Null,1,2,7 August 2014
Gone with the Wind," Gone With Vivien Leigh.
","When a group of women who called themselves The United Daughters Of The Confederacy heard that the role of Scarlett Ohara might be going to an Englishwoman they felt offended. Then when they heard that the role might go to Katherine Hepburn they changed their tune. 'Better an Englishwoman than a Yankee', they said. Without a shadow of doubt, 'Gone With The Wind' based on Margaret Mitchell's best seller remains one of the greatest movies ever made. Vivien Leigh was not only a great beauty she was also a great actress & gives a fantastic performance as Scarlet Ohara. Everyone who had read the book had said that the role of Rhett Butler just had to go to Clark Gable, even though Selznick International Pictures had to make heavy concessions to the MGM Studio for his services. Gable, himself, was somewhat reluctant to accept the role because he realised it was a 'woman's picture' & he might not live up to expectations. He did, of course, & the rest is history. Despite endless rewrites of the script & a change of director from George Cukor to Victor Fleming it all worked out well in the end. When Victor Fleming took over he is reported as saying the script was 'no effing good' & ordered another complete rewrite. Max Steiner wrote a really marvellous sweeping musical score for the movie, another of its strong points. Possibly the most memorably famous scene in all movie history takes place about halfway through the movie to Max Steiners music known as Tara's Theme. With the confederacy destroyed by war & Scarlet Ohara's home Tara also ruined she stares angrily up to the heavens & makes her 'As God Is My Witness' speech. It is wonderful stuff & this a wonderful movie.",Null,6,9,27 June 2015
Pride & Prejudice," Jane Austen It Ain't.
","There are so many holes I can pick in this 2005 adaptation of Jane Austen's great novel 'Pride & Prejudice' that I scarcely know where to start. Let's begin with Matthew Macfadyen & Keira Knightly who represent pride & prejudice respectively. Mr. Macfadyen's portrayal of Fitzwilliam Darcy is just awful, in my opinion. His acting is so flat that he manages to make the handsome, proud & haughty nobleman seem so dull & uninteresting that you wonder how any woman could possibly fall in love with him. Keira Knightley does better with her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennett but she doesn't seem at all like a middle-class young lady of the Regency period. This isn't entirely Miss Knightley's fault, of course, but more the fault of the production team. If you are going to adapt a novel from the time when Jane Austen lived then you have to give it some accurate historical detail which this production noticeably lacks. Donald Sutherland as Elizabeth's father Mr. Bennett seems completely miscast & Brenda Blethyn as her mother doesn't feel right either. She comes across more like a Dickens character than Jane Austen. Tom Hollander plays the pompous, somewhat comical parson Mr. Collins who proposes to Elizabeth & is rejected. He just doesn't seem anywhere near pompous enough or at all comical as written by Jane Austen. In my opinion only Dame Judy Dench playing Darcy's aunt Lady Catherine De Burgh can take much credit in the acting department. As was quite correctly pointed out by another reviewer the dance where we are first introduced to Mr. Darcy & his friend Mr. Bingley seems much more like a peasant barn dance than a refined regency ball. It would be very interesting to hear Jane Austen's opinion of this production but I bet she would have hated it!. Both the 1980 BBC production with David Rintoul & Elizabeth Garvie and the 1995 effort with Colin Firth & Jennifer Ehle were done very much better.",3,3,5,3 August 2016
Titanic," This Is Not A Wet Blanket.
","One harsh film critic memorably called this film, in his opinion, 'A wet blanket'. In my personal opinion James Cameron's 'Titanic' at the very least borders on a great film. A great love story is intertwined into the tragedy of this longish, but never boring, film. All in all it is not only an excellently entertaining film but probably both Kate Winslet & Leonardo DeCaprio's finest hour. Whether or not a rich high-society woman would be capable of falling in love with a poor steerage passenger, (who won the money to buy his ticket playing poker), in real life is debatable, but I was able to suspend my disbelief. Leonardo DeCaprio plays a young man called Jack Dawson who is an aspiring artist & is excellent. Although from a working-class background he is worldly-wise & has been around. He meets Rose DeWitt (Kate Winslet) after he saves her life when she attempts to commit suicide. She is intended (mainly at her mother's insistence) to marry a man named Cal Hockley played by Billy Zane. Rose doesn't really love him & things have started to get on top of her. Mr. Hockley is rich but such an upper-class scumbag that you cannot really blame Rose for contemplating topping herself!. The courtship on board the ship between Rose & Jack is great & often done to the haunting theme music in the background which adds to the romance. The cinematography by Russell Carpenter is absolutely beautiful & is probably the single best factor of the entire movie. The filming of the ship striking an iceberg & eventually sinking is particularly well done. My final comment concerns the closing credits as Celine Dion sings 'My Heart Will Go On'. Everybody, it seems, from the films smallest bit-player extras down to Mr. Cameron's tea lady gets a mention in the credits which really do go on & on & on! The number of people listed, but not credited, in the cast list is utterly astounding & I couldn't help wondering what, (if anything?), they were paid.",Null,0,2,13 October 2012
The Producers," One of the most brilliant, wittiest, funniest films ever made.
","Mel Brooks 1967 'The Producers' was way ahead of its time in terms of of zany, satirical comedy. It is utterly hilarious almost entirely throughout &, for my money, is THE champion mick-take film of all time. Mr. Brooks never spared anyone in his comedy films, of course. All were fair game but in this film Adolf Hitler & his Nazi party are taken to the cleaners & hung out to dry. So too homosexuals. The movie's premise is that Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) & Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) are trying to produce an almighty musical flop on Broadway after selling 100 per cent of its shares ten times over. After it's first night it should bomb so catastrophically that it will close, but they will make a bomb financially. So they search for the worst musical play they can find 'Springtime For Hitler' written by a crazy ex-Nazi soldier (played by Kenneth Mars) living in New York. When they meet him for the first time he rambles on extolling Adolf Hitler's praises whilst denigrating Winston Churchill. After he left school Hitler went to art college & began his working life as a painter. Churchill, too, used to paint as a pastime for relaxation. 'Hitler was a better painter than Churchill', he told Max & Leo. 'Hitler could paint an entire apartment in one day, TWO COATS!'. Absolutely brilliant & hysterically funny!!!. They cast another complete lunatic (Dick Shawn) in the role of Adolf Hitler & employed a raving transvestite homosexual (Christopher Hewett) as dance choreographer. One of his ideas is to dress his lady dancers as Nazi storm-troopers dancing in swastika formation. Max also hires himself a very sexy Swedish secretary, Ulla, played by Lee Meredith. Her shorthand typing isn't up to much but she even manages to make lighting Max's cigars sexy. 'You'll bury me you Swedish tease!', he tells her. The audience, at first, don't find 'Springtime For Hitler' remotely funny & are stunned into silence. 'Well, talk about BAD TASTE!', exclaims one lady in the audience. Max & Leo, meanwhile, have retired to the bar before they get 'stoned to death'. Then Dick Shawn's madcap Hitler does his thing & the audience start to find it comical. The hoped for disaster does not transpire & they are facing financial ruin. As I say it is all utterly hilarious. I have read that Peter Sellers was first offered the role of Max Bialystock but turned it down. When he saw it he realised he had made a mistake & thought it the funniest movie he had ever seen & I can easily understand why. For anyone who has never seen it, if you get the chance DON'T MISS IT. The 2005 remake is pretty good but steals an awful lot from the original!. Adolf Hitler would have had everyone involved in this lined up against a wall & machine-gunned to death!!!.",10,1,3,19 January 2014
Heat," Michael Mann's Masterpiece
","I think it's fair to say that Robert De Niro & Al Pacino are not two of the greatest film actors of their generation, they ARE the best two actors. Making a movie that lives up to their talent was never going to be easy but Michael Mann's 'HEAT' succeeds brilliantly. Led by De Niro, a crack team of professional thieves & bank robbers have carried out a number of unsolved crimes & detectives led by Pacino are determined to bring down the 'crew' responsible. Along the way, Pacino's obsession for his job is causing his marriage to break down. Likewise, De Niro has fallen in love with a young lady causing him to forget the maxim taught him by his criminal mentor, 'Never have anything in your life that you cannot walk away from in thirty seconds flat if you feel the heat coming round the corner'. When the two adversaries finally meet over a cup of coffee in a cafe it is a spellbinding moment. Pacino coolly warns De Niro that he intends to take him & his gang down. De Niro responds by telling Pacino that if he gets in his way he will have no hesitation in killing him. Besides the two main men, there are many other great acting performances in a film which studies not only the crimes but characterisations of its participants. The final chase scenes between the two main protagonists is electrifyingly tense & 'HEAT' is just a fabulous movie!",Null,3,8,31 July 2013
The Great Escape," The Great Escape is one of the all-time great movies.
","Based on a true story from WW2 'The Great Escape' is in just about everyone's list of favourite movies. Taken purely as escapist entertainment (if you will pardon an obvious pun), it is a very tough act to follow & the decision taken by its producers to fill it chock full of top-of-the-range film stars certainly paid off in spades. Steve McQueen will always be remembered for his iconic motor-cycle stunt-riding later in the film but there were many other memorable moments in the film. Trying to pick holes in this movie is churlish but I found it difficult to buy that Charles Bronson (tunnel king Danny) could suffer a serious attack of claustrophobia during the actual escape, even though i do understand it was done for dramatic effect. Genial James Garner (scrounger) always seemed to enhance anything he was ever involved in & was, as ever, great. Same goes for Richard Attenborough (big 'x' the organiser), James Coburn (manufacturer), David McCallum (soil dispersal) & Donald Pleasance (forger). German actor Hannes Messemer was also great in his role as Von Luger the camp commandant. I must have seen this film at least 20 or 30 times (probably more than any other) but I still love it. Mention should be made, also, of Elmer Bernstein's iconic theme music which was used for England's World Cup campaign by football fans but I cannot remember which one, (maybe 1998).",Null,1,2,23 August 2013
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Arguably the most entertaining movie ever made.
","Amongst all the IMDb reviews for Indiana Jones & The Last Crusade, one reviewer called it, 'the most fun I ever had watching a movie'. I, for one, cannot disagree with that assessment. The film is chock full of entertaining set-pieces, humour & the decision made to cast Sean Connery as Indiana Jones father Professor Henry Jones just worked wonderfully well. Alison Doody, in my opinion, was the best of the trilogies leading ladies. (Yes, i know there was a fourth but i am disregarding the later 'Crystal Skull' which was a mistake). John Rhys-Davies was great & Denholm Elliott always seemed to enhance any movie he was ever in. Take 'Trading Places', for instance. Most of the jokes used in the film are hilarious like when the 'Jones boys' are forced to travel to Berlin during a book-burning nazi rally. After dressing up as a nazi officer & recovering his fathers diary, Indiana Jones inadvertently bumps into Adolf Hitler. Hitler naturally thinks he wants him to autograph his book & signs it. Not long after they board an airship to get them out of 'the lions den'. As the airship is awaiting take-off the SS officer Colonel Vogel comes on board looking for Indy & his dad. Indy sees him coming & dresses up as a ticket inspector. Colonel Vogel first finds his father Professor Jones trying to hide his face behind his newspaper. Indy challenges the SS officer to see his ticket, punches him, throws him out of a window & declares to the astonished passengers 'No ticket'. The passengers, not wishing anything similar happening to them, frantically all hold up their tickets. Two great gags amongst plenty more!. If anyone put me on the spot & asked what is your all-time favourite movie, I would say this one.",Null,2,3,25 June 2013
