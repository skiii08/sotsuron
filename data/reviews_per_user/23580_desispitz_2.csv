Lucky Number Slevin," this movie i liked...
","u guys, i don't understand what more u could ask for from a film? intense action, HILLARIOIUS scenes, and i mean hilarious, even the most serious instances will make you start cracking up laughing, a beautiful Asian, and of course there is the ever intense Bruce Willis. this movie was so well scripted, this is proved in many scenes. Bruce and Morgan Freeman are AMAZING, both of which are in this film, and prove that acting is an art not just a hobby. actors of this callibar deserve a chance at the Oscars. josh hartnett is okay, just medium, i think this role was mostly written for the likes of Brad Pitt, but we got stuck with hartnett instead. lucy lu is HOT, bruce is intense, the rabbi is amazing, the two black henchman are just something to fall in love with as soon as u watch the film, this movie is definitely worth two or three watches, there are SO many little easter eggs in it, see if u can catch em all.",8,0,6,26 April 2006
Transformers," the best of 2007
","Alright so there's a lot of hype. And in Hollywood, Hype is almost never good.... well this time we're wrong! Transformers is perhaps the most intriguingly visually appealing film released since the original Jurassic Park, plus the amazing star cast have sparks whenever acting together which makes special effects of its own.Okay let's start from the beginning. I walked into Transformers with my sister thinking 'wow this is gonna be weak'. When my eyes adjusted to the darkness I realized how hard it was to find a seat. Once we finally did settle down I got to see four boring previews (except for Die Hard which is the best of it's lot). Then the movie started... and I was hooked. The sound is almost as sexy as the movie itself. You seriously feel like you're in the world's greatest Roller coaster ride throughout the movie. Shiloh Boueff is Hilarious, and the chick is so Beautiful. Like seriously, I fell in love. Tyrese and the other Soldier have amazing comedy chemistry together in even the worst situations (when u see it remember 'cell phone in Iraq'). But the gorgeous, most amazing, beautifully rendered characters have got to be the Transformers. My goodness, are they real? Did they really tear that city apart? were they really falling through a moving freeway? Did the Scorpion Trans really come out of the sand like that and snap that dude in half? wow it looked so real. So real, that you'll be looking at your car in a completely different angle.Michael Bay has always been an amazing director, but this time he cut through my heart. This movie is the best movie I've seen in a long time... I'm going to have to even say it's better than 300... yeah it's that good. When you go see it do not expect a kids movie... there's a lot of sexual references and the two hot lead women (a Analyst with the sexiest accent ever, and the who Shiloh sweats) Jesus Jessica Alba move aside. Meagan Fox is my new dream.But yes. Of all the films out right now (excluding Rattotioue cause I haven't' seen it) This movie holds the crown. Die Hard is tight... but not even close to the intensity of this movie. 1408 is scary, but not as scary as a Megatron... I love this movie, so much that I even went out and bought the game, an action figure, and I'm gonna reserve the DVD. Transformers is the best movie out this whole year. Go see it, and i guarantee you will never forget it.",10,5,8,7 July 2007
