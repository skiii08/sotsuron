Lucky Number Slevin," Single Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen.
","For aspiring screenwriters who are worried they have no talent this movie offers hope. When one goes to a movie like American Pie or Harold and Kumar they know to expect some simple minded escapism. However, with this film the disparity between the expectations created by the semi-notable cast and the completely boring and implausible narrative produces a nauseating disinclination for ever watching another movie for fear of having to have two hours of your finite life absolutely wasted. Please honour the additional time I have spent here and forgo watching this movie. Enhance the collective human experience by purchasing all available copies of this movie and throwing them out, or better yet shoplift them so the producers of this movie will not have the financial means to perpetuate their cinematic abominations.",2,5,13,28 April 2007
