Howl's Moving Castle," i love this movie
","oh my gosh i completely fell in love with this move the first time i saw it! i was so sad and happy! I LOVE IT! the way Sophie handled being old, and the way howl knew that she was the same person that he saved. but even more when me and my cousin said 'god she kissed so many people, she kissed the little boy, the prince, howl, and the witch!' but the prince apparently is her true love. also howl won because he got two kisses. ^3^ LOVE IT! Honestly i had a crush on howl during the movie. he looks better blond. Sophie looks better with the gray hair. but i still feel like the movie is incomplete. i am totally fore creating a howls moving castle two. well i said all that i can I'm just typing this cause i need ten lines. so u can go now. its just going to be nothing",10,3,6,29 June 2006
