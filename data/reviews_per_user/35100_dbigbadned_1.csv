Source Code," Begins well but spreads too thin
","The idea is nice, it begins very mysteriously and when the general concept is presented you sense there are going to be mind blowing things, something like Inception perhaps. Sadly, the scientific idea is purely presented and the writers give too much place to romance, it seems like the movie tries to attract women and do so by weakening the sci-fi part. I hate movies that try too grab too many aspects, the movie could go a little bit longer and actually build the idea of 'Source Code'. The romance is forced upon the story, like the writers were told they had to insert love and did it wrong. To sum it up, a great concept not so greatly presented. See if you want to satisfy your thrill hunger.",6,21,37,2 April 2011
