"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Decent Enough
","Saw this earlier tonight, it was good enough, nothing special, far from a classic but still, if you like some witty humour, this should appeal to you!It's basically about 'Fatboy' Dennis who attempts to run a marathon to win the respect of his former girlfriend Libby, and get his mate some £5,000 as well!It becomes even more interesting when Whit, Liddy's soon to be husband is running the race as well, Whit, as runners say 'Hit The Wall' and fakes an injury to get out of the race, while Dennis limps on and on to finish the race to show the people who didn't believe in him, believe in him!So overall a decent enough film with some funny jokes and witty humour, that most who like that sort of thing will surely enjoy this!7/10",Null,2,5,24 March 2008
Saturday Night Fever," Enjoyable film
","I saw the PG-Rated version of this film last night, i bought the video of eBay. I would like a DVD release soon though as the picture quality was pretty poor. Some of the night sequences were almost impossible to see and the audio was iffy at times but all things considered i enjoyed it still.The film stars John Travolta as Tony Manero, who after six days of hard work at a local paint store, heads down to his local Disco and catches 'Saturday Night Fever'. Everything is not all ship-shape for tony though, he has to battle naggy parents, a relationship and some mad friends.It annoys me that people criticise the sequel, it's great fun, okay the plot is weak but it's still enjoyable. And also how can one single film temporarily kill his career, weird.So overall a good, fun film. I wish this version was out on DVD though, come on Paramount i need this DVD!!!7/10",Null,0,2,3 June 2008
The Incredible Hulk," Better Than I Expected!
","All be straight with you, i'm not a big fan of superhero films, i might try some in the future who knows but for now i'm staying away from them.I only went to this film because some of our school was going to the cinema, and it was a choice between 'Superhero Movie' or this and since i saw Superhero Movie the week before, this was my only real choice.My favourite parts of the film were when Bruce Banner (a.k.a. The Hulk) gets chased by the government, they were really epic to watch, also the Hulk fight scenes were also good fun to watch.Some parts of the film were boring at times but on the whole it was a decent film! The best thing was that it was free, my good old school payed for the whole thing, nice!7/10",Null,2,7,13 June 2008
Deja Vu," Decent, brain busting film
","This is actually my second viewing of Deja Vu. The first time i wasn't that impressed, i found it boring at times and not very thrilling. I would've gave it a 6/10 at the time. But i decided to by the DVD the other day and, well i was impressed!It's basically about Agent Doug Carlin, who investigates an explosion on a ferry, with the help of this team of people who have found out a way to look 4 days into the past.I'll leave it to you to find out what happens in the end, but i warn you, it's not the sort of film that you should watch whenever your feeling tired! You need to be wide awake to understand the time travelling aspects.So overall, it's a decent, solid film.7/10",Null,1,4,12 July 2008
Rocky V," This movie is terribly under-rated....
","How does half the world hate this movie 'o rocky doesn't fight in the ring, blah blah blah blah' i don't care if he didn't fight in the ring it's still a great rocky film!It all starts of with Rocky getting of the plane and announcing his retirement, and then decides to run the old boxing club then he comes upon Tommy Gunn, who he trains very well and leads him to a lot of wins but Tommy ditches Rocky because he was not given a title chance, and after finally winning a title using all the skills rocky taught him, not a word of thanks is heard from him which results in a great street fight which rocky eventually wins.....So overall a great under-rated film which a recommend to anyone 8/10.",Null,3,4,30 November 2007
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," boring
","This movie was pure garbage, a pure waste of money to go and see this film, a pure, utter, bore fest, not often i would say this but the book is better! OK the start of the film was OK, that's as good as it gets, i would've been better watching 'on her Majesty's secret service' (another film i dislike greatly) at least it made me giggle, not like this excuse for a film! overall i absolutely hated this film so much, i will definitely not be going to see the sequel (why are they wasting money to make it anyway?!) and why waste £5 or whatever it is on a ticket, i'd rather watch paint dry!!! I will never Ever, EVER watch it garbage again as long as i live!",Null,1,5,5 November 2007
Elizabeth," Very dull, uninteresting movie...
","I saw this in History class about six months ago, i don't remember much about the film except for the fact that i was bored out of my mind watching it. It wasn't exciting, it wasn't interesting, it definitely wasn't fun and i definitely wouldn't recommend it!!!It's about the life of Elizabeth I, and if her life was as boring as this movie, i feel for her, i really do :(There's not much else to say, it was so bad that i couldn't really be bothered paying attention to it, it's not worth a rent for a Saturday night in, it could be your last.Hopefully this review wasn't as much of a torture as the movie was.5/10",Null,1,2,6 June 2008
Home Alone," Pleasant family comedy
","I've saw this film many times, and i've always enjoyed it. The most recent time i watched was sometime last year and as always i enjoyed it, there are plenty of laughs and a decent storyline as well.It's about about a boy named Kevin who is accidentally left 'Home Alone' (hence the title) and thinks his family have disappeared (Kevin wished that they would the night before) and at first enjoys this, but as time goes on, Kevin starts to miss his family and wishes they would return (and also he has some burglars to deal with), luckily his mum decides to get on the first available plane home, leaving them both very happy and then suddenly the rest of the family returns and are happy to see Kevin safe and sound.....All in all this is a pleasant comedy that i would recommend to anyone.7/10",Null,1,1,11 January 2008
The Day After Tomorrow," The Day After Tomorrow Film Review
","This is my FOURTH 8/10 in a row now, this is getting a bit scary, i mean i really know how to pick a good film, and this is another example, i bought the 1 Disc-Edition in HMV for a mere £3 (forget the special editions, i buy DVD's for the film, not the special features) a real bargain for a cracker of a film!Who cares if the film lacks logic, you don't watch films for facts, you watch them for pleasure. If you want facts, watch the history channel or something, Airport '79 also lacked logic but i still enjoyed it!So, my overall opinion is that The Day After Tomorrow is a very good and enjoyable film, well worth the small £3 i paid for it! Which gives it my fourth....8/10 in a row!",Null,0,1,11 April 2008
Blades of Glory," Funny but stupid and unrealistic
","This film i have to say that i enjoyed it but the fake skiing tricks and the very stupid ending kind of ruin the film, the ending was that they just fly out of the ice rink, come on, that's just stupid!The acting wasn't bad in this film, that gay fan of Jimmy was hilarious and defiantly boosted this movies rating.The film it's self is about two rivals of ice skating who team up and win the ice skating doubles championship , but it wasn't easy, there very many obstacles they had to overcome (example, they didn't get on at first) and it was a good watch but the movie being very unrealistic at times as i said earlier, ruined it!6/10",Null,0,1,22 December 2007
Rocky II," Brilliant, Brilliant stuff, one of the best sequels made....
","This film is just awesome, well worth the money i spent on it, i don't regret it one bit!Everything about this film was so good, the story, the acting, the everything, it is just such a good film, i can't think of any downsides to it, i'm only giving it a 9/10 because no film is perfect!The film begins with Rocky at the hospital, retired due to his many injures and accompanied by Apollo who is also badly injured they argue and such but don't get there fists going.Rocky tries to go on with life without boxing, he tries working at a meat factory but has to go because they need to reduce numbers.In the end though he decides to fight Apollo again and Wins the match after a very exciting climax (i was on the edge of my seat as they ref counted, i really was!) and there were a few tears coming from me at the end of this film, it was pure class, i recommend it to anyone at all!",Null,0,0,30 November 2007
The Godfather: Part II," As good as the original!
","I remember saying in my review of 'The Godfather' that i was going to review this film a week later, that was more than one week ago that's for sure. I did actually start watching 'The Godfather Part II' the next Friday, though i stopped watching after an hour because i wasn't really in the mood for it! So i decided that today, with nothing else to do, i'd give it another try and i wasn't disappointed! It was a great film, lots of talking but it's still great fun to watch. I only have one criticism, the length. It was extremely long, about 3 and a half hours! But that's my only criticism, everything else was spot on! Hopefully i'll be watching 'The Godfather Part III' soon and as soon as i do, i'll post my opinion right here! So overall, 'The Godfather Part II' is just as good as the original Godfather If you haven't seen this film yet, watch it now!9/10",Null,3,5,9 July 2008
The Bourne Ultimatum," This films delivers like Royal Mail Special Delivery!!!
","Some of you may notice that this is my second review of 'The Bourne Ultimatum'. The first time i wasn't impressed at all, i thought it was disappointing, dull, boring, slow paced etc, etc. But then it was showing on Sky Movies Premiere, the TV guide gave it 5 stars, i was outraged. Then last night, with very little to do, i decided to watch it. I'm glad i did watch it as i found it pulse-pounding, adrenaline rushing, heart pounding excitement from start to finish, i'm so glad that i took time out to watch it, it was awesome!!!The plot continues on from 'The Bourne Supremacy' with Jason Bourne still in Russia, on the run from the CIA and trying to find out his real identity. I'll leave you to discover the rest of the plot.I'm actually thinking on repurchasing the first two Bourne films, give them another try. How can i love this instalment while hating the first two?9/10",Null,0,1,17 July 2008
The Bourne Identity," Not what i expected
","I was expecting an action-packed, Adrenalin fuelled , exciting action film, i spent £24 on the Bourne Trilogy, 24 QUID!!!, i regret it to the back bone now, The Bourne Identity is torture, boredom most of the way, some decent parts that made me shiver but that was it, the rest was just boring.The start was very promising, i was thinking that this was going to be decent but it wasn't, it's a cheap excuse for an action film and is trying to copy the legendary James Bond, copying him BADLY!I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, not even people i dislike, i'm not THAT cruel...i just pray that The Bourne Supremacy is any better, to save the Trilogy, i'll be watching and reviewing it tomorrow!5/10",Null,0,3,22 December 2007
The Italian Job," Awesome action film!
","I've never seen the original Italian Job, but if this version is this good, i wonder what the original version is like?!I also liked the way they put some comedy into the film, a good balance of jokes and action!The story is basically about a guy called Steve who Double-Crosses Charlie who made a great plan that couldn't fail, anyway after Steve thinks the gang are all dead (their van was drove into the icy cold water!) and one year later is living the life but with the help of master safe cracker Stella, they pull of a heist to get their Gold back, and do after overcoming many obstacles and the gang get everything they wanted.....So overall this is a great film, i've been reading about a possible sequel, i hope their true!8/10",Null,0,4,18 December 2007
"I, Robot"," The 40 so minutes i saw of I, Robot was enough....
","I saw this in maths, and when i left class, i was dying to write this review, to state the flaws in this movie. Okay we skipped the start of it because my maths teacher had already seen it and told us to make up a beginning to the movie! He's a real joker.I thought most of the special effects in this film were crap, i thought they looked unrealistic (Okay another point to make, to any of you who have read my 'postive' review of The Concorde ... Airport '79, use are probably thinking 'What the heck is he on about?' but that was nearly 30 years ago, things have moved on, but by this films CGI standard, they obviously haven't realised how good CGI can be!) and also, i find the story stupid and crap, maybe it's because i'm not a fan of futuristic films (with the exception of Airplane II: The Sequel).I'm not going to bore you with they storyline, not even one line because this film is one of the worst i've seen since For Your Eyes Only over a month ago!So overall, i think A 6/10 is a bit generous but i think i 5 is a tiny bit low but meh....6/10",Null,0,0,13 February 2008
Rocky IV," Good stuff
","this is a good film, very good for a third sequel.... It starts of at Paulies birthday, where he is greeted by surprise present in the form of a robot, he dislikes it first but grows to love it (like the wife he never had!).Apollo decides to then fight Russian pile-driver Ivan Drago but loses the match and his life surprisingly, after the funeral rocky decides to fight him on Christmas day for nothing, no money at all involved, rocky said it's not for money.After a long gruelling fight, he wins both the crowd (they start chanting 'ROCKY, ROCKY, ROCKY!') and eventually wins the match, much to the surprise of everyone.So overall, quite a good flick, 7/10.",Null,1,3,30 November 2007
Batman Begins," Amazing!
","This is the first Batman film i've ever saw. I heard that it was meant to be good so i took time out to watch it on Sky Movies the other night, i'm glad i did it was amazing!I'm not really into superhero films but this film has got me right into them now! I've seen two superhero films this year and enjoyed two superhero films this year, they would be The Incredible Hulk and this one.Batman Begins tried to make a superhero movie realistic, and does a good job of it. It's not cheesy, it's dark and not made for young children.It also has some humour in it too. Alfred often reminded me of Q from the 007 films, witty and funny. The humour in this film saves it from being 100% dark and dry.I'll hopefully be going to the cinema to see 'The Dark Knight' soon, it looks amazing too and it's supposed to be even better than this one! Need i say more.9/10",Null,2,2,25 July 2008
Rocky," After my FORTH viewing, my opinion has changed greatly!!!
","If you have read my first review of this film, i didn't give it much credit, i wasn't a massive fan, i loved all the other Rocky's but this one wasn't my cup of tea!But after watching this with my mum last night for the FORTH time, my opinion completely changed, i enjoyed it way more than my first three viewing, for reasons i cannot tell.The only reason i watched this last night is because i was watching The Godfather Part II and got bored after an hour, i wasn't really in the mood for it, or was i? Anyway i then decided to watch this with my mum because she had never seen it before and wanted to see it, she enjoyed it too!I don't really need to tell you the plot, chances are you've seen it a similar plot in a more recent film.8/10",Null,0,1,30 November 2007
Rocky III," a very good second sequel....
","I really liked this film, a very good second sequel to the (in my opinion) not that great Rocky.....The film starts of with a montage of Rocky winning 10 world titles and then shows Paulie drunk and hating Rocky but they make up and go of home.Rocky then decides to Fight Clubber Lang (Mr. T) but doesn't train properly for it and ends up loosing both the match and his manager Micky due to a heart attack.He then decides to a re-match which he trains for properly and wins in only 3 short rounds, winning his self respect back.Overall decent film, 8/10.",Null,0,0,30 November 2007
The Godfather: Part III," A disappointing end to an otherwise fantastic trilogy
","I didn't have high expectations for The Godfather Part III. After hearing that it 'wrecked' the trilogy and the many jokes aimed at it through TV shows. But i'm still disappointed with this film, it's a real poor effort to capitalise on the success of the first two godfather films, it doesn't really fit in well with the rest of the trilogy. It's a real let down to be honest.Francias Ford Coppola really should've toned down on the amount of talking in this film. There's way too much of it, seriously. I found myself loosing concentration and letting my mind drift away and think about other things.Another criticism about this film is it's length. I probably would've rated this film higher if it was about an hour shorter. And it's not only The Godfather Part III that was too long, the whole trilogy is too long in my opinion! They should've made these films shorter in my opinion.I don't want a Godfather Part IV, three is enough and it would be hard to continue the saga without Michael Corleone...6/10",Null,1,4,17 July 2008
Hancock," Not bad for £3.80!
","It's great being thirteen, cinema tickets don't cost as much! lol. Anyway i had no real plans to see this movie until i was asked to go on Saturday night, i decided to go as i thought it would be a good laugh, plenty of giggles to be had!It's about a much disliked superhero Hancock, who is costing the city millions in damages due to his wreckless behaviour, and after saving the life of a business man, that man has a plan to win Hancock back his respect! I'll leave the rest for you to discover.Some parts of the film wern't funny, mainly because of the fact i'd seen the joke about a million times already on TV! I also disliked the fact that the plot had a sudden change half-way through, from being about Hancock redeeming himself to a stupid plot involving a superwoman who is much stronger than Hancock! Those are my only real complaints, the rest of the film is fine.7/10",Null,0,2,20 July 2008
Bruce Almighty," Gets better by the minute!
","I saw this in school just before the Christmas holidays, uh i didn't like it one bit, 15 minutes i thought was to long, but tonight, with nothing else to do, i decided to watch it again, this time all the way through!It starts of rather slowly like i said, but as the film progressed, it got better and better and better, and i was really getting into it and it was near the end and the DVD froze, it did that several times during the movie and it drive me mad, i couldn't get it to work (my brother obviously doesn't look after his DVD's well!) anyway i still enjoyed it a lot, and, even though being a comedy and during it, it mocks religions, it still gets a very important message across, i'm not going to tell you it, i don't want to spoil it for you.....7/10",Null,0,1,21 January 2008
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," As 'exciting' as the first...
","...if you can't tell i'm being sarcastic.I hated the first Elizabeth film, it was an uninteresting, boring film but enough about one bad film, let's go on to another, sadly...Okay, this was better but not much, the ending was very impressive but the other parts of the film lacked in every category, it was not just the lack of quality, the film was too gory for my liking, there were times where i had to look away from the screen, that made it even worse.It's basically about the Spanish Armada, that's all i picked up on the film, there's also some love story plot as well but i don't know what happened with it.That's about it really, hope i've put you off purchasing or renting this film, you'll be glad i did.5/10",Null,1,2,6 June 2008
Speed," Amazing action film!
","From start to finish, this film delivers action and comedy in great portions, the acting is great, the action is great, the comedy is great, everything is great!The film is about a bus.....with a bomb on it, and if the bus goes under 50 miles an hour, it will explode, (amazing how filmmakers could make something so great, based on a bus!) the story has many other twists, such as if Jack lets one passenger of the bus, the bus will explode!In the end they find a way to get the passengers of the bus and then themselves leading to a very angry criminal, who plots revenge....So overall, this film was amazing and i would recommend it to anyone interested in action!9/10",Null,0,0,15 December 2007
Click," Great comedy!
","I love Adam Sandlers work, he's a very good actor (Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy...) their great and this film is no exception.It's basically about workaholic Michael Newman, who has no time for his family as he is trying to get a promotion but after visiting a local store for a Universal Remote he comes across a guy named Morty who gives him this remote that can Fast Forward, skip, slow down and even pause time! At first life is a blast but after skipping a big chunk of his life to get out of doing paper work, things turn for the worse as the remote starts skipping years of Michaels life automatically and as that happens, he looses his wife and his relationships with his children. The remote skips him through lypo-suctions and a heart attack but after his heart attack, he risks his life and goes outside to his son, telling him he loves him and dies silently on the street.......BUT he realises it's all a dream, he is so relieved and decides to spend more time with his family, thus living happily ever after :D8/10",Null,1,3,5 January 2008
The Bourne Supremacy," Better than the first, but thats nothing special...
","If any of use have read my Bourne Identity review, you could easily tell that i didn't like it that much, this sequel is better, but it's still pretty bad.Most of the scenes were quite boring, even most of the action scenes were pretty unimpressive, the camera work was all shaky which ruined some scenes also but the car chase finale was quite good, i enjoyed it but that was all that was decent about the film.I hope The Bourne Ultimatum is better than the first two, i'll be watching and reviewing tomorrow.Overall this isn't that great of a film, i would've been safer buying some other trilogy than this...6/10",Null,0,1,23 December 2007
The Godfather," Atlast, i've seen The Godfather!
","I've been wanting to see this film for a while now, so i bought the new Godfather box set - The Coppola Restoration. I was worried that i wouldn't enjoy the film, because it is #1 here on IMDb and i had high expectations, i wasn't disappointed.To be honest with you, i thought it took the film about 30 minutes to get into it's stride, after that it got really good and enjoyable. It was so good after that, i had to sleep on it whether to give it a 9/10 or a 10/10, it really was a hard choice, believe me.The new Godfather Trilogy is rated for ages 15 and over, while previous trilogies have been rated for ages 18 and over. 15+ is a good rating, although there are some intense scenes (Sonny getting killed at the Tollbooth for example) it really doesn't deserve an 18 rating, i was expecting heads to have been blown apart and such but it's not that violent really.Now i can finally say i've seen The Godfather, and i loved it. I'll hopefully bee watching 'The Godfather Part II' next week and hope it's just as good, my thoughts will be posted here!9/10",Null,1,3,14 June 2008
