The Blair Witch Project," The Boring Witch Project
","The only good part of this movie was it's unique take on how the filming was done. It was not 'widescreened' as most movies are and flipped from black and white to color to represent the two different camera's the kids had.But mostly through this movie, I was bored. I found the most suspenseful part of the movie to be waiting for it to end. Watching three teenagers argue for over ninety minutes was all I could stand, I was very pleased that it finally ended.",1,1,2,6 August 1999
