The Blair Witch Project," For all those who forgot, or don't know, what a real horror film is!
","Through a series of connections; I got my hands on a copy of this incredible film. It is true horror in every sense of the word. I can compare it to no other, because it is unlike any film this generation has ever seen.If you can remember back to your childhood, when every sound you ever heard while under the covers of your bed seemed like some monster coming to get you, then you will have a small feeling of what it's like to see this film.If Psycho kept women from showering, and Jaws kept people out of the water, this film is sure to put a major dent in out door camping.Go see it, them calmly go to your room and hide under the covers.",10,1,2,31 May 1999
