Skyfall," Best Bond Yet
","Action scenes tempered with artistic flair add a certain class not seen in the film franchise's recent history, but within themselves are inherently 'Bond' and make this film my favorite ever. Excellent acting, most notably Javier Bardem's, lend a certain magnetism to the plot and the presence of a story associated with the villain give this film a more personal edge. Further exposure of the rough vulnerability of Daniel Craig's Bond and focus on the development of this enigmatic character are strangely endearing, without returning to the stale events of Casino Royale. It is with eager anticipation that I await this new Bond and his return to the classic plot with a revamped cast.",8,1,8,4 November 2012
