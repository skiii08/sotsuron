The Monuments Men," Nauseating
","Clooney, aka Mr Pretentious is bad enough at the best of times, but this 'vehicle' had me wanting to pull his teeth out.The whole premise of this movie is flawed and it is a very skewed representation of the 'true story' on which it is based; I'll stop a little short of saying that it is an outright lie.For the uninitiated: a group of soldiers are tasked with re-capturing famous works of art, stolen by the Nazis.My largest problem with this is the assertion made a number of times throughout the movie that in some way, artwork is more important than human lives because 'a bunch of people might be killed, but this is our culture'. Spoken like a true Hollywood luvvie and colossal pillock. Culture is CREATED by human lives EVERY DAY and any given life taken by war is one that could potentially produce the next masterpiece.The fact that Clooney sunk his teeth into this cringeworthy, pretentious twaddle says a lot about the man. Not to mention the fact that some extremely talented artists serving on the monuments men squad lost their lives, thereby depriving the world of any artistic contributions they may have made had they survived.The acting - with the exception of clooney (who seems to only have one character no matter what movie he is in) is exceptional; I can't fault it at all. It's just such a shame that this same ensemble wasn't used for a better movie.It is RIGHT that goods were recovered from the Nazis, but to suggest that this endeavour was in any way more important than human lives makes this a dark period in human understanding and not in any way entertaining to watch.",2,4,7,25 February 2014
Underworld," Excellent story, Lead cannot act.
","The fact is that a movie is the sum total of the story and the acting. Some people disagree and include the effects in that sum. That's their choice.The reality is that no matter how good a story is, if the acting is bad beyond a certain point, nothing can save it.And - I have to say - that is true for this movie; at least as regards the lead part 'Selene' aka Kate Beckinsale.Don't get me wrong, 'Michael' and 'Lucian' (played by Michael sheen) give outstanding performances. But despite their heroic efforts, they simply cannot undo the damage that having a terrible actress as lead has done.Casting for this went terribly wrong in that someone in their infinite wisdom, confused 'pretty and dumb' with 'pretty dumb', when in fact neither would have worked.So we have a scarecrow in a rubber suit, a single facial expression and no discernible talent. Fantastic.I guess I will have to wait 10 years for the 'reboot' at which point I sincerely hope they find someone that can act. The funny thing is that - even 10 years on - I would still want sheen as Lucian because he is just an exceptional performer!",1,3,10,3 December 2013
The Prestige," Work of art
","Despite the similarities and the release timing, this movie is very different from 'The Illusionist' in that it is more of a character study into very obsessive individuals as well as an adventurous, exciting and intriguing example of what film-makers can achieve if they really try.The performances are outstanding, the storyline complex enough to keep you guessing till the end. There are some really quite clever plot twists and surprises.Im happy to say that I didn't 'work it out' until the various revelations.Very well made and thoroughly enjoyable; a thinking persons film.",10,6,10,14 July 2007
Horrible Bosses," Absolutely Hilarious - Almost the Perfect Comedy
","First off, let me get one thing out of the way. There is only one thing that spoils this movie and prevents me giving it a 10 out of 10 and that is Jennifer Aniston. She is barely believable as an actress in any of the productions she has assaulted with her presence and this one is no different. I can appreciate that most guys wont see this, as she gets her breasts out during the movie and if that is the only way that this charlatan can get work, she should consider an alternative career.That aside, the other actors in this movie more than make up for Anistons lack.The idea isn't a new one and I would be lying if I said there weren't funnier takes on the 'disposal of boss / partner' theme. However the story has unique elements that literally had us pissing ourselves laughing (quite relevant - you'll see!).Great acting, great storyline, great laughs.",9,0,1,25 November 2012
Underworld Awakening," Another stab at rescuing a good idea, poorly implemented.
","The underworld series has a lot going for it....as STORIES.The sad fact is that they put a malnourished female in a rubber suit and hoped that this would somehow overcome the most problematic issue with the underworld franchise: Kate Beckinsale simply cannot act.Now, granted, I like the female form as much as the next person....but unlike some, I don't see it as a replacement for talent. Give me a fugly girl with amazing talent (or at the very least, simply does her job well) and I will pick her over a pretty moron EVERY TIME! The fact that my wife is very sexy is coincidence; I was attracted to her brain first! But this single issue has absolutely RUINED the underworld saga. As a good example: compare the characters Lucian and Selene in the first Underworld: Michael sheen of course plays Lucian and he is absolutely outstanding in it. Kate Beckinsale on the other hand is so wooden that you really just want to see her naked for the sake of getting SOME entertainment value out of what you pay to see the movie; she really is that bad.This movie is no exception. She fell into a formula requiring little or no effort on her part and leaving us with a character that may as well have been a bit part.Despite valiant efforts by the other actors, unfortunately Beckinsale makes this a non-starter and it is therefore utterly deserving of the 1 star rating.",1,3,5,3 December 2013
The Hills Have Eyes," Something very wrong....
","There has to come a point where a line is drawn defining that which is entertainment from pure sadism.Given that many people will disagree on where exactly that line should be drawn, this movie still manages to go way beyond what any reasonable human being could call entertainment.Lets be clear, the point of this movie is violence. Any so-called plot is inexpertly slapped on almost as an afterthought it seems. The movie from start to finish is the product of a very sick individual (or individuals) and its my honest belief that using or viewing movies like this as entertainment is extremely unhealthy. There is something very wrong with people who can see this as entertainment and perhaps needs addressing through the realisation that there are positive types of excitement as well as negative ones.Given the nature of the movie, it is almost impossible to grant it any awards for acting ability, script, effects etc because all of these are deeply overshadowed by the gore and negativity this movie exhibits.Needless to say, I didn't thank the friend who took me to see this bilge!",1,10,19,1 October 2007
Pearl Harbor," utterly dreadful, proving that Oscars don't mean anything!
","Historically incorrect, fundamentally egotistical, appalling acting and overly misleading. the 'rant' at the end of the film about American having - effectively single handedly - won the war (and every one since) says it all. Denial is such a wonderful thing....Oscar winner? Don't make me laugh! Well that finished off any sense of credibility the Oscars had in my mind. If film-makers insist on re-writing history to suit a public in denial (other peoples as well as their own) then the legacy they will leave is one of very poor workmanship and an ever-lasting impression of utter stupidity.",1,5,9,15 September 2007
The Illusionist," Exceptional
","Exceptional is a word I rarely use, but it applies to this movie....Which is odd because I don't like magic shows. However If you're expecting a cheesy gold-spangled idiot pulling llamas out of his hat, you're in for a shock! The performances (with no exceptions) are perfect.The story is captivating, imaginative and pretty original.One of the few decent things to come out of Hollywood for a long time and a breath of fresh air.I got to see this film early and at about the same time as 'The Prestige'. I thought it an odd coincidence that two films from the same genre appear at almost exactly the same time, but happily - despite their similarities - they are both different enough and good enough to make it irrelevant. So there is no point in my mentioning it. Really.Words to the wise: If someone irritating insists on talking all the way through the movie about 'how its done', visit www.euthanasia.org. You'll be doing everyone a favour!",10,0,1,14 July 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," An alternative, imaginative, shocking and unexpected masterpiece. Deserves 'classic' status
","There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this movie deserves all 10 points and probably deserves more besides.Allow me to drag out of hiding a word I reserve specifically for special occasions.....Exceptional.The general story isn't a new one by any means and has been done before (with varying success) by others long before. But this has to be the pick of the crop and it is very, very unlikely that any other will come close to approaching the quality of this version in the future.The acting is truly perfect and I was - frankly - gobsmacked at how well someone like Jim Carrey who comes across as a bumbling ninny was able to do this sot of thing so well. Carrey, if it was your goal to make the switch from humour to 'serious' acting, congratulations; you did in one movie what many others in your shoes have been utterly incapable of doing in a lifetime.Kate Winslets performance is - as ever - spot on. A very talented individual indeed.Its impossible to explain any of the plot without spoling so I'll leave the reader with this: Just go see it. If you 'dont get it', I feel sorry for you.",10,0,3,15 September 2007
Dark Shadows," The Burton Depp Bonham-Carter Elfman team does it again!
","It has now reached the point that any movie these guys release, we buy because, even if not the blockbuster of the year, we are guaranteed a good evenings entertainment. And we love that about these guys. OK so there is a 'formula' there and it is a bit dark, but then they have demonstrated that even in darkness there is diversity. It was a nice surprise to see that it was set in the 70's and the music, cars, sets and costumes were spot-on. The soundtrack was superb and while Depps stilted English accent started to irritate after a while, morbid curiosity makes one stick with it (as does so much of the BDBCE franchise) until it becomes less so.I see that lots of others who have seen older versions of this movie are unhappy with this new version, but as people who have never seen the original, we thoroughly enjoyed the story.Lets be clear, there were not many places where we were roaring with laughter, but it was consistently enjoyable and it was very funny in places. Definitely added to Christmas list!",9,2,4,1 November 2012
Prometheus," What were they thinking?!
","Initially dreading 'Yet another Aliens movie', I watched it anyway and was nicely surprised at the idea of humans travelling through space to meet their gods....and then I realised that what I was watching was actually quite dreadful.I can honestly say that apart from one short visual sequence involving one of the 'gods', the rest of the movie left me cold. I was under the - obviously - mistaken impression that Hollywood had learnt that effects - however well done - simply cannot make up for a lacklustre storyline.As a standalone story, the 'humans flying through space to meet their gods' would have worked. The absolutely clumsy way in which they merge the aliens angle actually made me cringe and my respect for Ridley Scott has definitely taken a tumble as a result.Wont be on my Christmas DVD list. Very disappointing.",2,3,8,1 November 2012
