The New World," Probably the Greatest Film Ever Made in the U.S.A.
","This is art at its highest level of achievement. Viewing such excellence makes me proud to be an American.As evocative and yearning as the greatest poems, as sane as the most profound meditation, and as deep as the most sumptuous dream, 'The New World' is an achingly beautiful film. It is the most sensual 'no-nudity' film you will ever see. The eroticism here reveres life and reaches out lyrically and sacredly to all creation.Christian Bale and Colin Farrell are powerfully present on-screen and give two of the best understated performances I've ever seen.God has blessed Q'Orianka Kilcher with great beauty and talent; her smile could warm ice to melt in Antarctica, and she is freshly sensual in an unspoiled way as only a young woman can be. Kilcher is excellent at quietly portraying the nearly impossible journey Pocahontas traveled socially, emotionally and spiritually. That she navigated through the great joys and sorrows of her short life is a testament to her strength and humanity.The cinematography is beautiful - with its natural setting, vivid colors and diffused lighting making objects and people almost palpable.When I say this movie is probably the finest ever made in the U.S.A., I do not mean to imply in any way that it resembles the glut of sausage mill product being extruded out of Hollywood. There are no silly car chases, no phony battles between purely good and purely evil characters, and no bankrupt moralizing which panders to a fawning, lazy audience. Thank God!A supreme achievement, 'The New World' is the cinematic equivalent of swans drifting slowly on a lake as the fairest summer day of the year closes.As soon as it became available on blu-ray, I purchased it, because I wanted something this transcendent to have a place in my home.Thank you, Mr. Malick, for this peerless work of art!",10,6,10,24 January 2010
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Redford and Newman Together - This Time, Hollywood Gets It Right
","Justifiably praised for the successful pairing of Robert Redford and Paul Newman, 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' is an expertly crafted Western which turns away from being bombastic or hard-hitting. The moderate to light tone the film-makers choose makes this film like a refreshing summer breeze: By the time you appreciate how fine it is, it has nearly blown past you. Thoroughly entertaining yet not insipid, this movie has visually memorable moments. For example, when Butch and Sundance flee to high ground as night falls, they turn round to look for the trackers pursuing them and see the beams of their lanterns advancing in the darkness - a scene which is simultaneously beautiful and unsettling. Well wrought and enjoyable, Butch and Sundance displays a very rare achievement in Hollywood: combined star power effectively employed.",8,0,1,28 April 2011
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Mister Coppola Drops the Ball, and the Casting Director Hires Two Bush-leaguers
","There are two big problems with 'Bram Stoker's Dracula.' First, the movie takes too many liberties with Stoker's novel in terms of plot and tone, especially when you consider they went through the trouble of putting the novelist's name in the actual film title. This unusual step implies that you made a good-faith effort to stay true to the author's creation. In the book, Mina does not love Dracula at all and she is not the one who slays Dracula. And although you might be able to uncover some hints of sexual symbolism in the Victorian novel, the movie makes sexuality a major component of the story throughout. Now I believe firmly in zero censorship and I'm all for frank presentation of the female and male body and, if need be, sex - when it's artistic and appropriate; but out of respect to the novel, the eroticism in this movie is over the top, incongruous, and sometimes unintentionally comical. The second big problem is the casting. A man of means, Francis Ford Coppola has made the gems 'Apocalypse Now,' 'The Cotton Club,' and 'The Godfather.' He could have insisted on top-notch actors. How he allowed Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder to assume British roles is beyond me. O.K., so the casting director made two grave errors, but this powerful director could have stepped in at that point. Reeves always comes off as stiff and lifeless and Ryder is seldom believable, and both are thoroughly American. Coppola could have held two casting calls in England, one for the character of Mina and the other for Jonathan Harker. By blindfolding himself and lobbing 2 balled-up socks into the British actors assembled, Coppola would have come away with a much better Mina and a much better Harker. Strangely, the normally superb Anthony Hopkins turns in an unconvincing and uninspired performance in this film. While watching the film, I got the feeling Hopkins realized the film wasn't going to be good early on and simply mailed it in. The four stars are for some moments of eerily beautiful and effective cinematography. On the whole, this is a disappointment and a misfire.",4,3,5,10 April 2011
The Reader," And the Award For Best Performance in This Film Goes to . . . David Kross
","An ambitious work of art, 'The Reader' nearly matches the very high achievement of the novel on which it is based. There is no syrupy, Disney-style distortion of real life; nor will you have to endure the usual Hollywood pandering to pressure groups - no tired prudery masquerading as pseudo-raciness in this film. Simply put, the honest, forthright portrayal of a beautiful, terrible and heart-wrenching love story is a godsend for those used to the dishonest babble of Hollywood.Kate Winslet does a fine job of portraying Hanna, both as a seductive train conductor in her thirties and as an older woman wasting away in prison. David Kross's performance as young Michael, however, is slightly superior to Winslet's. When it comes to young male performers, forget the insipid silliness of Zac Efron and Jesse McCartney. Kross is not a hollow piece of eye candy, but a young man of substance who courageously dedicates his body and his considerable acting skills to his craft. He is especially good in the scene where he reads 'Huckleberry Finn' to Winslet.To its credit, 'The Reader' does not shy away from the negative after-effects Michael struggles with when dealing with his cub-cougar relationship with Hanna. Regarding the Holocaust, when Hanna asks the judge a pointed, naive question, we are forced to consider the role self-preservation and human frailty play in the face of overarching, domineering evil.This movie easily surpasses some films frequently listed by critics as among the greatest of all time. Off the top of my head, 'The Reader' is superior to 'The Searchers' and 'Midnight Cowboy' by a good margin. It contains some of the finest love scenes ever filmed, and the scene in which Hanna washes Michael while they're both standing is one of the most poignant, beautiful depictions of the male body in all of cinema. 'The Reader' deserves the highest recommendation, and all adults should make time to view it except, perhaps, for those who have an aversion to the sight of the human body.",9,0,0,21 April 2011
Identity," If on a Rainy Night a Traveller . . .
","'Identity' is an excellent, ornate whodunit sporting some unusual twists. The film boasts a superb performance by John Cusack. The setting gives a nod to Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho,' and the film is complex and multi-layered.If you enjoyed the way 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Memento' revealed their stories, then you'll like the presentation of 'Identity.' In general, if you liked 'The Usual Suspects,' you'll enjoy this movie. On the other hand, if you prefer a straightforward story line and representational realism, you may be disappointed by some of the turns this film takes.'Identity' will have added appeal for viewers who enjoy rainy night scenes.A very good effort worth watching!",8,2,3,30 January 2010
