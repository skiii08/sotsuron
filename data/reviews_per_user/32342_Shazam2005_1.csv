The Hangover," Total GARBAGE!!!! Please don't waste your money!
","What unadulterated tripe. I've never seen such utter kak in all my life. Not only was it insulting to someone of moderate intelligence, to class it as humour...what can I say? I'd rather have stuck hot needles in my eyes. This movie was SO boring. The whole reason you go and see a supposed 'funny' movie is so that it makes you laugh. Not in this case. You d rather see the stupid characters in this film run over by a double decker bus. That'd be a lot more funny.Mike Tyson has a cameo role in the movie and boy is he a bad actor. I know he isn't one to trade, but his scenes should definitely have been left on the cutting room floor. Like many other aspects of the movie, he was cringe worthy. People will argue that his stint in the film was 'crucial' to the plot, which goes to show just HOW bad this film really is, if they could have done without it.Just crude, predictable drivel. No plot, annoying characters and a bad script. I also hate it when they use swearing to try and make something seem funnier than it really is. Albeit, nothing is funny in this pathetic excuse for a film. I d quite happily have killed all four leads. Especially that guy with the beard. Who does he think he is?? Jeff Bridges? Let me tell you, he's a long way off being that. What a terrible 'comedic actor'. Just genuinely annoying.I normally wouldn't t write anything on the boards, but after having read so many people saying it was hilariously funny, I really had to through my tuppence worth in to the contrary.To sum up, I d rather have watched a greasy bogey slide down a window than watch this.If you wanna see something funny about guys partying in Vegas watch 'Go'...a whole lot more entertaining.Save yer dough and spend it on something worthwhile... a pint of bitter or something?",1,30,68,28 June 2009
