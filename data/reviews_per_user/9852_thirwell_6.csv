The Blair Witch Project," this movie sucked
","this is the worst movie ever made.another movie with a great idea and horrible execution.  given the introduction, i was not expecting a linear film.  but having three kids yell 'f**k' more frequently than an NWA record does not make a film.i was shocked to find that this thing was only 90 min.  it drags on and on and on.  sorry but i'm not scared by a shaking camera and some twigs.the tail end finally looked like it was gonna pick up, but then it was over.they should rerelease this with the middle 80 mins cut out.",1,2,4,1 March 2002
The Blair Witch Project," the worst movie ever.
","i can appreciate what they were trying to do with this, but it just failed. 90 minutes of three dorks running around in the woods?  what the...i must say i didn't think there were so many ways to say the 'f' word - which is about half the dialogue. there was hardly any history on the characters, so it was hard to care for them.  after a half hour, i was praying for the witch to come out and take care of these losers. and then the ending.  i liked it, it was good,   but it was the only interesting part of the movie. (i'd go on, but i find it hard to express my true feelings for this movie without cursing like a madman.)",1,2,5,6 November 1999
Minority Report," another dissapointment
","basically an awesome premise that stevie gradually destroys over 2 1/2 hours.plot twists come out of nowhere, really bad dialouge and an exposition overkill and some cg effects that look like a 10 yr old nintendo game and character's motivations either are confusing or don't seem to exist.shame little stevie for stealing that shot from the end of blade runner.and if i had the power, i'd put you in director's detention for that lame ass ending.",5,1,2,7 February 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," big dissapointment
","as you've read in other reviews, there's alot of things left out or changed from the books and that sucked, but i'll skip that.this movie was like sitting through freshman english - for 2 1/2 hours.instead of the terrific character development like the first film, we get a long ass war scene, an elf 'tony hawking' down the stairs and dwarf jokes. what the hell?  was this thing directed by vince mcmahon?i was just so suprised to see a shroud of dumb thrown over the whole thing.gollum was okay - not nearly evil enough, way to cute.aside from the isengard scene at the end, i don't ever need to see this piece of crap again.i realize that this is an unpopular opinion - maybe i drunkenly stumbled into 'two weeks notice' by mistake.",5,0,0,9 January 2003
Mulholland Drive," another great one from David - *small Spoiler*
","I finally just saw this film. I liked this much more than Lost Highway, it flows alot better.  Even though it's not as fast paced (relatively speaking) as Blue Velvet or Wild at Heart, it's a fascinating journey. It has a bit of the dream-like quality that was all through Eraserhead.My one complaint has more to with the initial promotion of the film.  Right from the beginning I had been hearing about the girl/girl sex scenes. If you have seen this film, you will know that that information really kills the climax of the movie.A little note on the DVD.  I really appreciate the lack of chapter selection and commentary - this film is meant to be watched straight through without interruption.",9,1,1,13 April 2002
Gladiator," okay, but nothing to write home about *little spoiler*
","i must be the last person on earth to have seen this (5/02), and i was in no hurry.  i almost always disagree with the 'academy'on the good side - some cool cinematography, good set design and special effects (mostly) and Joquain Pheonix.the bad - the characters seem a bit flat, they should have developed more. i couldn't help but laugh at some of the names Commodus and Maxiums Exodus Leviticus Deuteronamy whatever... and one really bad FX shot where Russel kills a tiger - it looked like they got a stuffed tiger from a state fair.overall: good, but i don't ever need to see it again",7,0,1,12 May 2002
