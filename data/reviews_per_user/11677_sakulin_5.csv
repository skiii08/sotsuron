The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," Dreadful
","I watch a movie to be entertained. This flick was not entertaining. Symbolism be damned. The movie was as annoying as many of the reviews posted on here, a bit over the top. Reviewers at this site are apt to try to impress readers with their literary skill. They read like the nonsense I remember printed on the covers of old LPs. Doublespeak. Please people, lets restrict our comments to plain old everyday English.I'm an American but prefer foreign movies to most of the action crap produced by Hollywood. This one was a bit much. The gloomy photography was annoying. The French Veronique was one short of a six pack. She never bothered to look at the photographs she took in Poland? She decided she was in love with her stalker after inviting him to her hotel room? Love? Both women were totally promiscuous and the viewer never knew the guys the women were having sex with.I'm sorry but I didn't get it. A waste of 100 minutes of my life. I could find similar symbolism watching paint dry. One poster, from Spain, took at swipe at at the American movie industry of which I am no great fan. However, his comments reflect the xenophobia is alive and well in Spain as it here here in the US.",1,15,57,24 November 2005
The Death of Stalin," A Let Down
",I was expecting a serious depiction of history but what I saw was slapstick. This was supposed to funny? Factual? One scene had a reference to Abbott and Costello which is what it resembled. Half an hour was enough for me. What a waste of a very good team of actors. One star is generous.,1,5,14,26 December 2018
Salt," Unbelievable Garbage
",This unfortunately is the type of trash that Hollywood does so well. Why did I keep watching it? The violence is so intense and the stunts so utterly ridiculous that the movie is almost laughable. Anti-Russian propaganda that would have one believe that Russia has completely infiltrated our society. I thought the Bourne series were bad but this makes them appear to be a picnic. CRAP!,1,3,7,12 October 2018
Everest," Boring and Annoying (possible spoiler alert)
","Couldn't wait for this movie to be over and had zero sympathy for these fools that put their lives at risk to climb a mountain. The Brolin character claimed that he was bored when at home but felt alive when climbing. Later admitted when on the mountain that he had eyesight problems. Real smart guy. Duh. Was the loss of his hands and nose worth it? Think of the self created anguish through which they put their families. Like skiers, who venture into dangerous territory after being warned of an avalanche risk, relatives ask the authorities to put others at risk to save these macho idiots.I'm reminded of a movie that I saw years ago about two Austrians attempting to scale the north face of the Matterhorn. Near the end of the movie one of them was hanging helplessly from a rope shouting that he didn't want to die (which he did). Thought about that a little late didn't he! Totally boring.",1,8,13,8 January 2017
The Bourne Supremacy," Eye Candy for Violence Addicts
","SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Another Hollywood exercise in gratuitous violence. Entertaining perhaps but a tad tedious. A formula flick. We know immediately that the girl is going to get whacked. And we also know that one of the main bad guys is a CIA insider. Matt appears to have all the tools at the perfect time. He just ' happened' to have a license plate in his bag of tricks, a mind-boggling supply of tools to perform his deeds, and an endless supply of money. He was fluent in God knows how many languages and how can any human take such physical punishment and keep walking. He never ate, never slept, never went to the john. If he was so smart why didn't he take a time out to disguise himself. Even a Groucho mask.And the ending. Give me a break. The endless car chase. Get it over with. Haven't we seen this before? Maybe a thousand times? And no automobile can take that kind of punishment and keep rolling.A few days before watching this crap I had seen a beautiful Chinese flick called 'The Way Home'. No violence and just nice people. And prior to that a fantastic Spanish production 'Talk to Her'. Why can't Hollywood make thoughtful movies like these? I suppose that Bourne is a reflection of our violent society.This was a waste of my time.",3,2,7,15 June 2005
