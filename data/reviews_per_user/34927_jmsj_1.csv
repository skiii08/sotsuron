Catch Me If You Can," good movie
","this was a good movie, well acted, and thankfully not 'over the top'.  the story moved along very well.sure, there wasn't really a HUGE  climatic point in the movie, but it sure kept my interest from the opening animated credits (with the cat & mouse type music) all the way to the end.  i'm not really interested in altogether how abagnale pulled it all off, but rather that he just did is amazing given that it was only a little less than 40 years ago.  whether or not hank's character or walken's characters in the movie were accurately portrayed, i enjoyed their characters very much.  ...as said in my first sentence: not over the top, to me, which is WAY more realistic than any thing else. hanks was an fbi agent doing his job, nothing more. yes, i'm guessing here, but i'm sure there are numerous amounts of fbi agents with the same low key persona that hanks portrayed. oh, i especially enjoyed the relationship hanks and LdC developed in the movie--kudo's to spielberg on this movie and john williams for an enjoyable stray from his other movie music.~janet",Null,0,1,16 January 2003
