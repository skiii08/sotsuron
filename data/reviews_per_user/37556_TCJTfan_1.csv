Mission: Impossible III," Mission Impossible III Fulfilled It's Purpose
","I expected to see a well acted movie with good production values, and was not disappointed. I did not want to be forced to think about controversial social issues of the day. I was not. There were no 'slow' places, the action level was just right, and Tom Cruise and the rest of the cast did their jobs very professionally. I found the movie relaxing, stimulating, and not distressing or disturbing. It was precisely what I always found the original Mission Impossible series to be - interesting, fast moving escapist fare. I chatted pleasantly with my friends on the way home and slept well. What more could one ask after a hard day at work?The rest of the full house opening weekend, last show of the evening Los Angeles audience must have had a similar experience - there was a loud burst of applause at the end of the show. Would that all movies fulfilled their purpose so well. And, by the way, I think I would enjoy knowing and talking with Tom Cruise. He seems an intelligent, articulate, informed, and talented person. If I ever meet him, I'll let you know.",10,0,1,13 May 2006
