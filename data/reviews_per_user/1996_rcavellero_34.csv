Kill Bill: Vol. 2," SUPERCOOL!
","The films combined make one hell of a revenge story masterpiece. The first one in my opinion was definatly a little more enetrtaining. But this one reigns over it in style, dialogue and growth and development. you feel for the charachters as you witness their transformations. tarantino proves that he's truly talented and has a knack for origiality. the film's plotline is basic she's in search of her final 3 oof the death list 5. The people that murdered her friends and tried to murder her and her baby. However the cliffhanger at the end of the first one left the audience knowig her daughter was still alive. overloaded with wondeful comedy, clever dialogue, excellent performances, and intelligent and stylish direction this vol. 2 will stand the test of time. it's already a legend much like the title charachter's story.",10,1,2,17 April 2004
50 First Dates," 50 GREAT DATES!
","I just finished watching 50 First dates and I must say that I was overly and pleasently suprised.  Although I thought the on screen couple had formiddable charm in The wedding Singer it still seemed like a Adam Sandler film which are usually duds.  My expectations weren't very high but they were more than met.  The couple display extremely likable, gooey, chemistry and the film is Sandlers best it's heartfelt and more of a romantic comedy than just a dumb comedy. Drew Barrymoore stars as Lucy a young woman whom suffers from short term memory loss after a horrific accident with her father. she is prone to relieve the same day over and over again courtesy of her father and his friend's gimmicks. That is until Sandler enters the picture as a player of women but whom falls for Lucy at first site and doesn't give up when it comes to her disability. Many funny scenes ensue but he learns ways to make her fall in love with him each and every day. These two have sparkling, remarkable chemistry.  Individually they give some of their most heartfelt and emotional performances as they struggle day to day with the situation. And the humor which there is alot of is very, very funny and totally on key. The director treats the situation with suprising delicacy and heart. he doesn't teter on juvenile humor but instead embraces the romance as to ask what kind of sacrafices would be made for a perfect love. Rush out and experience an instant romantic classic and by far the best film of the year. 50 first dates is 50 Great dates!!!!",10,0,0,13 February 2004
Finding Neverland," FINDING IS CINEMATIC NEVERLAND!
","Without a doubt the best film I've seen all year. Finding Neverland is the most winning emotionally charged, fantasy infused drama you're ever going to see. Beautifully filmed and expertly directed the film sports fine award winning performances by Depp and Winslet with a solid supporting cast. Everything about the film is just plain beautiful and just plain perfect. it's the story of Peter Pan's play author James Barry who after a section of writers block falls in love with a single mother and her four sons. From them he is inspired to write the classic Peter Pan. The film is inspired by true events and inter cuts scenes of emotional realism with scenes of imaginative creativity scene through the charchter's eyes. The brilliant execution only screams out pure magic in a film that won't be matched this year. i haven't cried like this in a film in so long. even during the credits I spouted tears of sorrow as well as tears of joy. Joy for finding a movie of such beauty and creativity. Of such originality emotional power. of such a cinematic Neverland.",10,0,0,27 November 2004
Dawn of the Dead," REMAKES RULE GENRE TERRITORY!
","I have to tell you after watching the stupid teaser for this film my expectations weren't very high. And although the trailer kicked major ass I still had doubts on wheather it would even be a mediocre film, it didn't have much going for it. A brand new commerical director, a big studio, a remake of a (in my opinion) passable flaky classic.  And even after meeting the cast at the Fango Convention in January, I got a little amped to see it but still had my doubts. All of those doubts have been put to rest today. Following the same logic as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake this is more of a reimagining borrowing the basic ideas and updating for our times. Dawn of the Dead isn't just a good film, it's a great one. And a landmark genre picture at that. It follows the basic setup of the strangers meeting at a local mall, where they fend off hordes of zombies while trying to indulge themselves in an acceptable lifestyle. Only for the horrors of the world surrounding them to come crashing in. And boy do they do. The film boasts some of the most imaginative death sequences seen in a while and captures the overall dread and horror brought forth by the source material. Unlike it's simplistic and over hyped predecessor this film remains entertaining while staying respectful, clever and scary. It also helps that the film is fueled by taut direction, good performances especially from new horror heroine Sarah Polley and believable charachter growth and story development. The effects are also over the top, grotesque and very creative.  However the only way the film falls short is in the way that it doesn't match Chainsaw's story telling or overall intensity. But this film is definatly a new horror classic, the new generation can embrace and the old genration can treasure. One thats respectful to a genre fan's needs and yet can overcome critical stabs and remain succesful. Dawn of the Dead is just another example of how Remakes are beginning to rule genre territory and new flicks are just seemingly falling flat. Their are many reasons to cherish this film cinematograoghy, hilarious soundtrack choices, an intensly scary tone, great spfx, good story, believable performances, expert direction but the one main reason to go see it is that it's worth your money.",9,0,0,19 March 2004
The Girl Next Door," GO WITH IT...
","It's hard to explain The Girl Next Door and why it's such a great film. But trust me it is, and go see it. It's 100 percent fantastic. I went into the film with mediocre expectations at best. But this film completely exceeded them. I could have gone in with high expectations and still been completely satisfied but going in with slighter expectations has left me completely astounded everything about this film screams professionalism. As it starts off with a collage of High School life done to yearbook pictures and nostalgic music of mostly anyones childhood. it's the feelings it brings forth that inspires memory and classic nostalgia. your only wishing at this point that the film could keep up this feeling through out it and does it one better and creates something completely original, somewhat magical and totally believable.  But as for the films plot which is filled with more depth that you can hardly imagine. It opens with a young man whom is questioning his HS years and their lack of enertaining memorabilia. Than enters the girl next door a young woman played by the beautiful and completed talented Elisa Cushbert of 24 and she is a stunner believe me when I say that. He meets her, she meets him issues ensue and she decides to give him the memories he's in search of just because of the innocent way he looks at her. But she has a secret you see she's no ordinary girl she's actually a porn star whom just quit her job trying to find a more suitable and respectful career. One she has settled into because a lack of better choices and because of the way she's always been treated. Now with the synopsis I am gonna completely stop there because to give anymore away would be wrong and if I did you'd probably be like what the hell is this? and never see it. But trust me it's worth any price you would pay and completely worth a viewing. The film is completely layered and three dimensional. It's beautifully written and the characters and their performances are smart and sexy. Although the film appears to be a sex comedy it's that  sex appeal that it usues to draw you in and than drops you over on it to teach the audience an apporpriate and heartfelt lesson. With all the cliches and silliness pushed to the absent side. The performances, direction and writing are all inspiring and you can expected to see these talented faces and names headline cinema for years to come. This film rocks it's almost everything you could want of in a movie. As it moves along it gets better. And when it ends your completely satisfied and you will carry a well deserved smile through the entire day following and whenever you decide to discuss it. Intelligent, provocative, sexy, funny, dramtic, emotions these are all things that describe this film but I'll use the credo that one character lives by and passes it on to others. Who cares what people think just go with it!!!! And run out and see this.",9,0,0,9 April 2004
Alexander," Alexander THE MAN...
","I'm sitting here still astounded at the critical and audience reaction that this film has suffered. The film is just flat out great. Especially compared to recent sword and sandal epic Troy. Stone's Alexander goes on an entirely different route an overly realistic portrayal of a confused young man manipulated by the people around him and seduced by the power in front of him. The film's excessively large 150 million dollar budget could have been taken down to a mere five million to tell the intimate and personal story of it's title character. Just as confused, direction less and lost as the film seems it represent it's title character to the core. Hollywood took a big gamble on this one the film stands as a true work of art especially with all the gay undertones that are important and emotionally relevant to telling the story. There are many reasons why people will have a problem with this film. Narrow minded unintelligent people. And others just may find it somewhat drawn out or boring but every single scene is necessary so that you may feel it's emotional impact. Angelina Jolie gives a surprisingly reassuring performance as Alexander's manipulative mother and gives us reassurance of why she took home the Oscar that night. Jared Leto and Collin Farell make the hottest gay couple of the year sporting killer bods and amazing tear inducing acting. But the film fares less than perfect. Although quite an accomplished, original and thought provoking film it also sports a lame score and some slightly corny dialogue that induced slight laughing amongst the audience. But besides a few moments of okness the film overall represents a huge cinematic overhaul coming our way. One of intelligence and desperation. Of Heart and passion. Wheather Alexander scores big or flops(which it will most likely do) it will inspire many members of it's true target audience to excel in life.",8,16,28,27 November 2004
Alexander," Alexander THE MAN...
","Oliver Stone's Epic production Alexander minus the Great part is a very fitting character piece. The film's excessive 150 million dollar budget could've been drawn down to a mere 5 million to incorporate the character growth the film represents. It's going to be quite hard for the film to find a true audience with the overly apparent gay undertones and the ultimate smallness the film requires to tell it's story. I believe people will go in expecting a big Hollywood epic and instead will receive a confused, sometimes directionless film that beautifully represents it's title character. Everyone knows the story of Alexander so there's no need to go into that aspect. But what they don't know is of him. I'm not sure how factual this story lies but it's expressed supremely realistic and is done in an artful and respected fashion. Collin Farell makes a fine and gorgeous leading man he has a bit of learning to do with the control of his emotions but otherwise gives a surprisingly moving performance. Jared Leto gives a dominating performance as Alexander's main lover and their chemistry is expressly ripe and heartful. The show stealing performance comes from generic beauty Angelina Jolie who despite her last umpteenth horrid films give a wonderfully reassuring performance of why she took home the Oscar that night. Rosario dawson is minimally entertaining as Alexander's first wife despite a laugh inducing start. The film is beautifully shot with striking cinematograpghy but sports a lame score. All things said I must say that I was overly impressed by Hollywood's bigtime gamble which from slight audience reaction won't be paid back. Alexander nonetheless stands as a true work of art a sleeper masterpiece that will find it's target audience among few who will greatly appreciate it. 10/10",8,1,7,25 November 2004
Constantine," Ultracool with no energy...
",For people with low expectation I feel Constatine will deliver the goods. it's not a bad flick it has some ultra cool visuals an interesting storyline and some satisfying twists. But for people whom are looking for something a bit more it will bring the disappointment on.The film lacks any type of real direction. it's quite obvious that it's a first time helmer and he doesn't do a horrible job. But with all the intense subject matter fails to create even a smidge of tension or geuine suspense. The performances are of course lackluster with a big disappointment coming from Rachael Weisz. Not a huge disappointment for me cause I can enjoy what the film has to offer but for many I feel that the combination of lacklusterr details will have you screaming for the exits. 6/10,6,0,9,25 February 2005
Chicken Run," delightfully entertaining!
","Chicken Run breaks new ground in family film. As the film boasts and creative and surprising storyline, coupled with delicious dialogue and intelligent and entertaining humor. The film is a trademark amongst claymation. But it remains irresistably entertaining for children and adults of all ages. As a group of chickens try to escape their coop before their turned into chicken pot pies. Everything seems pretty hopeless until a charasmatic rooster lands on the scene sending hearts and hopes aflair. No matter how it be prepared to enjoy!",10,1,1,1 November 2003
Ocean's Twelve," SHOULD HAVE STOPPED AT 11...
","I have to admit my expectations were quite low before walking into this messy sequel retread to the former crowd pleasing hit. I wouldn't say that the first one was the bet film ever. But it was definitely a great one, with wonderful characters, clever plot twists, smart dialogue, great chemistry and a lovable cast. Banking on the mound of talent they have with Iceans 12 is that almost everyone involved forgets to try. The film which is more of an overblown series of lackluster sketches thrown together to try and formulate a workable plot ultimately fails. With the exception of a truly comical performance from Mr. Damon. And a wonderful as always turn out from Ms. Roberts. the films lies still as a conceited homage to improvised humor and directionless direction. Even the score, and supposedly raw and realistic cinematograpghy seem manufactured and tailor made to fit a certain Hollywood damn. all the finesse and fun of the first movie are gone leaving it only with a monstrous helping of tedious style and substance. The plot or lack there of, of this one concerns the man they formerly robbed finding them and wanting his money back in two weeks. Now as always in these movies you can expect some twists but these are short on originality and long on predicatability. Take from me they should have stopped at 11. A few laughs aside Oceans 12 is one of the biggest overly hyped stinkers to come along in a while. 3/10",3,1,2,11 December 2004
Alien," A MASTERPIECE!
",Alien is a true horror sci-fi classic.  The film is a staple of american cinema and one of our only true masterpieces!  Sigourney Weaver made her big screen debut as the film's leading lady. A heroine that would go onto to develop and influence every female heroine that came after her.  It all starts when they investigate a strange signal coming from a nearby planet. They investigate the source and one of the crew members is attacked by a deadly E.T. They bring him aboard the ship and in a exquisitely terrifying scene the alien is born and gets loose upon the ship. It begins to grow as it feeds and soon comes fater the remaining cast members. With scenes that set the standard for every suspense scene ever filmed. Ridley Scott directs the film with horrific pizazz piling on the horror laden suspense and intelliegent and convincing performances. The direction is taut and the cinematography is claustraphobic and intense.,10,1,3,27 October 2003
Closer," DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO PERFECTION!
","It's once in a very rare time that I go to the movies and I'm treated as an adult. I see a film that is intelligent, thought provoking, provocative and rawly realistic. Closer is that film. It present an honest portrayal of four severely unlikable characters and they screw with each others love lives back and forth. The film is told in adult sporting complexity through the growing plot points , the way it's filled and it's tasty advancing dialogue. Everyone in the film turns in a powerhouse performance worthy of Oscar consideration. Ms. Portman is wonderful as Alice shedding her blockbuster star wars acting skills and portraying someone multi dimensional with heart and pizazz. Julia Roberts stars as Anna in a cold, subtle performance which will leave audiences appreciating her acting believability as she pounces through each of her scenes with charismatic force. Jude law and Clive Owen are the real surprises here both turning in wonderfully appealing performance. Strong, weak, flawed and memorable. Especially whose last outing was the entertaining but mediocre action summer pic King Arthur. The film has wonderfully tight direction and sports beautifully placid colors and a fine adult score. The film draws dangerously close to being a near perfect film. I only wish it could've gone on for abit longer I wasn't completely satisfied to the ends of the characters on which we were give. but life itself isn't perfect or satisfying and this is a slick of someones life. Rush out and go see Closer! Oner of the best film's of the year!",9,378,571,4 December 2004
Corpse Bride," a beautiful haunting
","THE CORPSE BRIDE Warner Bros 2005 color 83 minutes Musical/Fantasy featuring the voices of Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter Directed by Tim Burton Rated PG for adult themes Hot off the creative gem remake Charlie and the Chocalate Factory Burton returns to his artistically drab Nightmare before Christmas roots for a pleasant if over hyped excursion into the after life. Corpse Bride tells the tale of a nervous gentleman wonderfully modeled after Johnny Depp who gets cold feet on his wedding rehearsal and while practicing in the woods accidentally marries the corpse bride. a young woman whom met an early demise on her wedding day. There is obviously lots of singing and macabre gimmicks as he tries to escape her and return to his real fiancée. The movie is littered with creative ideas and imagination galore. But it ends up a little on the shallow side when it comes to feeling like a complete film. Although hauntingly beautiful and a glorious technical achievement topping nightmare before Christmas's wizardy the film relies too much on it's underdeveloped characters and storyline to pull it's weight through. In the end it remains nothing more than brilliantly artistic, souless but a hauntingly beautiful piece of artwork. But it's a nice one indeed. ***(out of five)",6,1,3,27 September 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," THE END
","People just never seem to be happy. I was quite skeptical going ito this film. Especially after the horrid sequel that proceeded it. But I must give credit where it is due. And the final chapter in the trilogy certainly deserves it in abundance. It has what it's predecessor didn't. Entertainment value. Although the acting was still mediocre filled with some poor performances, the chemistry non existent. The dialogue wasn't as philosophical but it was more cheesy this time around. The film managaed to suceed on many levels it did spout some charachter growth, make some sense of the trilogy, have fantastic action sequences, a kick butt score and a helping of great entertainment which is what the original had presented. I always had though the matrix to be clever but never anything more than big budget hollywood bonanza. And this signifies the ending of a somewhat overblown but all together entertaining film series. To even try and explain what would happen would be to give to much away. But the film is definatly worth the admission it should have the mainstream audience reaching for their wallets for showings to come.",8,2,4,5 November 2003
Cold Mountain," SUPRISINGLY WARM MOUNTAIN!
","Cold Mountain is just full of suprises. I must say tht I did not completely enjoy this film. But I liked it alot.  I found it to be very creative and involving.  The love story aspect of the film isn't particularly invovlving but what the film does succeed at is showing the loss that war brings on. On all accounts, from loves to families to lands.  The horror of war is very apparent in a film that fills it's moments with constantly changing charachters, weird humor, and a war torn land. Some of the suprise pop ups include Natalie Portman showing her acting chops, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, The sexy guy from 28 days later, the guy from the white stripes and etc. The real reason I went to see Cold Mountain is for Nicole Kidman and although her porcelain presence and timeless acting are just as good as ever. Her role just isn't enough to sustain a real powerful performance. However Renee Zellwegger is the extreme stand out performance, with a rocky sense of humor and times of melodramtic overacting she contains into a heartfelt performance. Hottie Jude Law also does a fine job showing his charachter's complexities as he goes from one emotion to another. From acceptance to despair, from love to hate.  The film takes place during the last quarter of the civil war as Law and Kidman are seperated as he goes off to war. She longs for him as her father dies and he realizes the horrors of war.  She tries to keep the farm in shape as the local villain tries to take it from her, and she slips into lonliness from having no one and nothing. The war takes it tolls on everyone and everything and Renee Zellwegger enters as a young hard working woman whom decides to help Kidman. The only strong chemistry is those formed from friendships. The kidman Law love triste lacks it but they certainly look great together. Making probably the most sexy couple on film of the year! Cold Mountain doesn't draw any real tears besides a watery eye it remains overly warm and even though it's quite depressing it manages to leave you in good reassuring spirits.",8,1,1,1 January 2004
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Not worth the wait...
","NOT WORTH THE WAIT...a review for The 40 yr. old VirginThe 40 yr. old Virgin Universal 2005 Color 116 mins. Comedy Steve Carrell, Catherine Keneer, Paul Rudd, Elizabeth Banks and Kat Dennings star. Written by Judd Apatow and Steve Carrell Directed by Judd Apatow Rated R for raunchy language,sexuality, nudity, drug use and vulgar toilet humor. After a few good reviews and some once trusted recommendations I persuaded myself to attend a mid afternoon screening of the late summer comedy hit the 40 yr. old virgin. I went with my very good friend Melanie who can make anything into a good time. Despite the trailer making it look somewhat entertaining I just got a bad feeling about it and decided to skip it and see Red Eye a few more times. Boy was I right! Joining the ranks of other uncomfortable comedies such as The American Pie trilogy, The Meet the Parents films and The Analyze This films among others. Now don't get me wrong this is not a wretched review for this film. it's not a bad film it's just far from being a good one. Steve Carrell of Anchorman fame stars as Andy Stitzer. A homebody, sweetheart of a guy whose a 40 yr. old virgin. he spends his time working as the stock manager at a electronics store, collecting toys, doing solo karaoke, reading comic books and riding his bike. He tries his best not to interact with very many people especially the opposite sex. Than one night when the guys are short one for poker. They invite him along and discover his big secret. Immediately becoming alarmed they decide to take action and influence him to loose his virginity as quickly as possible. Crude situations follow. And this film is crude. Thats mainly the reason why it exists. The depiction of virginity, women, sexual intercourse and humanity are all degraded to the fullest. And not with a winking eye or guilty chuckle but with a devilish stare none the less. Carrells characters is put through one humiliating situation after another. Now I never get offended and when I do there is good reason. I know people like the title character and although I myself am not a virgin I do hold their decisions in high regard. And I would never endorse anything that exploits that, especially for trashy, mindless humor. To assume that you can take an individuals physical awkwardness towards their sexual awakening personally insults me. And than to handle it's touchy subject matter so shamelessly and carelessly with not a speck of originality or intelligence. The film packs it's sluggishly paced 2 hours with raunchy language, ridiculously drawn life lessons, nauseating bathroom humor and immature revelations. Add that with a particularly lame chemistry free romance between the underused Keneer and Carrell and the finished product is one of regret. Although not a total waste of film Carrell's performance is one of comedic promise still and he must search for a better comedic vehicle.Despite all the film's problems there are a few gags that still inspire a giggle or two. But in the end the 40 yr. old Virgin is just a mediocre lay a grouping of wasted potential. What could've been a heartfelt, hilarious little comedy. ends up being an immature, chauvinistic romp that lacks any real conviction in it's subject matter and the laugh department. My suggestion is if you must wait for DVD and catch The Wedding Crashers again cause this film just ain't worth the wait. ** (out of five)",4,6,12,4 September 2005
The Butterfly Effect," A UNIQUE EFFECT!
","Walking into this film I'm sure expectations from anyone couldn't  be very high.  Especially since it's from the team that penned and brought together the Final Destination sequel and stars Ashton Kutcher in his first big dramatic role with a supporting performance from funny girl Amy Smart and unknown actor Ethan Suplee whom is just all over the advertising for this thing.  But throwing all those mis conceptions to the side. I must say that this film is pretty damn good.  Hell even great and has a very unique effect on it's surprised audience.  First I would like to give kudos to all involved the film is pretty ballsy, it's also extremely well done, has unpredicatble twists and is quite creative.  The only thing that falls semi flat is the acting, although it's not bad it's also not very good. And a story of this magnitude and importance could have used some better supprt. That said let's talk about what this film is about.  Sexy Ashton Kutcher stars as a young man whom has a strange illness that prones him to blackouts. As he grows older after an insufferable childhood he learns that he has the ability to go back and fix whats wrong with the past. But he can't do it without effecting the future. Every time he goes back he alters something else sometimes for the better but ultimately for the worse. His struggles invovlve a first love, a sadistic brother, murder, pedophilia, child pornography, drugs, prostitution and etc.  And that's putting it lightly the film comes together at an unexpected but necessary conclusion and manages to be truly one of the most depressing films ever made. So I urge all moviegoer's out there that wanna experience something different to run out and see The Butterfly Effect. It's more of an experience than a film and one thats not soon to be forgotten.",8,0,1,24 January 2004
Alien vs. Predator," AVP IS A BATTLE WORTH THE WAIT!
","People have been waiting a very long time to see these two foes in the same frame of a big budget Hollywood blockbuster and the day has finally arrived. Paul Anderson of the totally underrated Event Horizon and Resident Evil fame directs the latest installment of both franchises with a separate pizazz. It's quite obvious that Anderson is a fan of the source material and holds both franchises in high regard. Not only does the film stand well on it's own it feels like an entirely different type of film. The movie promises with trying success to mash storyline, emotional development and kick ass fight scenes together and it partially succeeds. No matter who you are or what your expecting if your paying to see a film entitled alien vs. predator you will get your money's worth. However, the film doesn't prevail without any faults. Audiences have been waiting a very longtime for this and for the film to be utterly perfect would be a miracle and it's not. There for, ultimately a slight disappointment the people involved do the best job to keep the originality afloat. The story centers around a group of people whom stumble upon the ets during the battle while investigating an ancient pyramid. Seemingly built with the predators help. It seems that every hundred years there is an all out avp war so that the surving predators may graduate and become true warriors. Sanaa Lathan of Love and Basketball, Lance Henriksen (bishop of the Alien films) and gorgeous Raoul Bova head up the human fodder. The acting in some scenes is very good however in others it's never bad but somewhat unbelievable. Lathan makes a formidable female but a Ripley she isn't. And sorry Lathan but the comparison is going to be inevitable. It's no doubt that people will be happy and people will be ignorant and people will be appreciative of this film. But no matter what complaints are presented the film succeeds as a workable picture even though the second half seems a little rushed it delivers more entertainment and scares than it has any right too. AVP stands as the beginning of hopefully many promising sequels. And as a late summer scarefest worth the price of admission. 8/10",8,2,3,12 August 2004
Hellboy," AMAZING!
","I must say I would have never expected in my wildest dreams to enjoy a film like this so much, much less this one.  Hellboy has it's faults but it's truly comic book/horror/fantasy hybrid masterpiece. It is the probably the best comic book movie I've ever seen. Based on a little known comic book I'm sure people will be running to buy now. Hellboy is the story of a group of bad guys whom are trying to destroy the world and end up bringing forth a small child like hellboy. After years of being raised by his founder he becomes a superhero monster fighting bad guys like himself and bringing them to justice while defending humanity. He's helped along in his quest by pyro girl Liz Sherman played beautifully by Selma Blair. And a very cool intellectual fish Looking guy referred to as Blue. But those people are back to destroy the world again as they have ressurected their master and it's up to Hellboy and his gang of misfits to protect humanity and foil their plan. I'm sure it sounds surely predicatble but that something this film lacks in troves. It's completely original, completely new and just great. The performances by Ron Pearlman, John Hurt and Selma Blair are completely involving. The story is well developed, emotional, scary and funny. The direction is taut and well developed. Definatly Del Toro's reigning masterpiece. I must say I was overly impressed by this film probably because I wasn't expecting too much but I can guarantee you one thing I will be going to see it again. Hellboy is amazing!",9,71,108,3 April 2004
School of Rock," THIS SCHOOL ROCKS!
","I usually hate Jack Black but I do love those Richard Linklater movies. And this is a Richard Linklater movie. And although I have liked Shallow Hal and Orange County I've never quite given any credit to Jack Black. You have to give credit where credit is due.  And he deserves some credit. School of Rock may be somewhat predictable but it's done in an unpredictable fashion. The humor is smart, the performances are intellectually believable and the story move salong at a fast, inspiring and humorous pace. This may not be the film of a lifetime but it definatly aspires to be better than most and succeeds. School of Rock is more than an entertaining night at the movies the film manages to educate it's audience on moral issues as well spinning ur heart muscles and keeing ur rolling in the aisles with laughter.",8,0,0,26 October 2003
Million Dollar Baby," Phenomenal... The best film of the year!
","So I decided to go see Million Dollar baby on a whim after it was nominated for best picture and boy was I disappointed with myself. For not rushing out to see this astonishing motion picture. Clint Eastwood becomes a master of film with the story of a struggling woman coming out of her youthful prime whom is dying to be trained by him for women's boxing. He's a scruffy old fashioned guy who doesn't believe in training girls and cares to much about his fighters to watch them get hurt, sometimes blocking them from excelling. She is basically defined by herself to be white trash she works very hard as a waitress by day and eats peoples scraps off their plates to survive. She saves all her excess money to train at the gym and for equipment. In some of the film's saddest and most powerful scenes she confronts her trashy family and they have not a thread of redemability. Hilary Swank remains in her finest hour here even after her amazing performance in Boys Don't Cry if she doesn't get an Oscar for this it would be crime. Clint Eastwood is a masterful director and a star he directs the film with passion and acts with conviction. the film covers extremely dark territory and still manages to find some light in it. never before has a film based on any sport including Rocky hit such emotionally depressing depths. That are as memorable as they are powerful, littered with the years finest moments and talent Million Dollar Baby is phenomenal it leads the pack for the bets film of the year! 10/10",10,3,6,10 February 2005
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," RESIDENT PRAISE!
",Resident Evil Apocalypse rocks! Anyone walking out of this film and not saying that had no business watching the movie to begin with. The dynamite sequel features Milla Jovovich in a kick ass performance as Alice. Picking up right where the last one left off. Racoon City has been destroyed by the T virus and it'sa effects as it was mistakenly let loose from the contaminated Hive. The now infamous Umbrella Corporation quarantines the city locking a few survivors and it's deadly inhabitants with them. Amongst the characters are game idols Jill valentine played brilliantly by Sienna Guilroy and The mummy's Oded Fehr as Carlos Olivera. The film also features the Nemesis. if you have no idea of what I'm referring too you have no business seeing this film. It's definitely a high for RE fans to see their fav games done with such justice. Sure maybe the acting and dialogue are a bit cheesy but it's all part of a much bigger picture and I for one can't wait to see this brilliant franchises end result.,9,2,3,11 September 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," THE WAIT BEGINS...
","I just returned from a screening of Kill Bill vol.1 and I must say that I was completely impressed and pleasently suprised.  Quentin Tarantino has revived the entire action genre.  Although there wasn't anything completely new in this film, it managaed to do everything in a new and creative way. However, I must say that to most it will seem completely original and it is. But people just won't get the many homages and sincere throwbacks to the grindhouse and splatter classics of the 70's. Pretty much the best decade of film. The suprisingly talented Uma Thurman(gattaca) gives a heartfelt and kick ass performance as Tarantino's title charachter bleep!( that's what happens everytime they speak her name.) You see four yrs. before the film starts her own assasination squad turned on her and she was brutally beaten with her husband and unborn child and murdered on her wedding day. Or so they thought. She wakes up out of a coma after four years and the revenge begins to gush. And does it gush since this by far the bloodiest R rated film in probably forever. But it's done in a respectable, cartoon like manner. So that it doesn't come off offensively but more light hearted. Now I definatly don't wanna soften this movie down. Cause it is indeed an extremely graphic genre picture. But it also has extremely sentimental and passionate performances from it's cast, powered with great dialogue and a brisk and bloody revenge tale.  Go see Kill Bill right now! The wait is on the cliffhanger at the end of this one rivals any other cliffhanger ever created. The wait is on!",10,0,1,12 October 2003
The Last Samurai," TOM CRUISE ASIDE, THE FILM MEETS THE CRITERIA FOR A MEMORABLE FILM EPIC
","I just want to say that I went into this film wanting to hate it. Although I've never really hated a Tom Cruise movie I've always been put off by the fact that he's in them. It angers me in a way. I don't think he's a particularly good actor and his film choices usually seem like crowd pleasing safe ones. Don't get me wrong he's not really a bad actor either he's ranged from the slightly off(Born on the fourth of July) to the decent(Jerry Macguire) and to the even more confident(Eyes Wide Shut). This film presents his performance in various degress from cheesy and melodramatic to inspired and worthy. Sadly enough theres not an overwhelming abundance of the second. But the film fares just fine without it. Edward Zwick of legends of the Fall has created a truly moving epic. It's in the race to be the most depressing film of the year right after Ron Howard's The Missing. Although it seems a bit contrived the film ultimatly delivers on a very emotional epic scale.  Tom Cruise stars as a Captain during the civil war. He suffers from guilt and has turned to alcohol from seeing so many innocent native americans butchered. He longs for his life to have meaning and to find some sort of peace. He's shipped off to Japan to teach their soldiers to defend themselves in combat with guns against the samaurais'. He is unfortunatly captured after a fierce and gory battle and succumbs to their way of life and their teachings. Ultimatly adapting to it and learning to love it and the people around him. It is truly a wonder too see the film progress on an emotional level and no matter who you are it will at least draw a tear or two. The film for the most part is well acted, the script is decent with a few unintentionally funny lines, the direction is simplistic and grand at the same time, the score is moving and the cinematography is lush and mood driven. All in all you must give Credit where credit is due. And although Tom Cruise may not totally deserve it he does do an average to above average job of capturing his charachter's complex emotions. Tom Cruise aside, the film more than meets the criteria for a memorable film epic.",8,0,0,7 December 2003
National Treasure," A TREASURE WORTH THE HUNT!
","Let me start of this review by saying that before I attended the screening of National Treasure I really had no expectations or any real wanting to see this film. Nicholas Cage isn't one of my favorite actors, Jon Tutletaub is not one of my favorite directors, This Adventure treasure hunting genre isn't on the top of my list and the trailer just made it seem a little boring.Diane Krueger of the wonderfully underrated Wicker park and Mediocre but entertaining Troy was the only exception. However, I'm ready to eat my words. Everyone associated with the film seems to do more than an admirable job of making the film highly entertaining and laced with thinking man's clues. Nicholas Cage stars as the descendant of of the Gates family notorious to the historical community for pursuing a make believe treasure that doesn't exist. He finds a clue leading himt o the declaration of independence which he steals so that he can read an invisible treasure map on the back. The film tours many other historical locations. Setting up countless, breathtaking and exciting action sequences. Now don't get me wrong the stunts aren't so incredible but their all underplayed so that they hit home and seem more respectable. I must say it's not the best film out there but it's a pretty darn entertaining movie. The story and the clues to unwrap the plot are very interesting and the film is populated by many likable performances making it one of Bruckheimer's more likable efforts. Cage also make s a welcome come back to the action genre. So people if your thinking about going to see it. Do it this Treasure is actually worth the hunt! 7/10",7,0,0,23 November 2004
Mystic River," A SHOWCASE FOR ACTORS...
","As a film Mystic River is a good one. it has an interesting story and is directed well. The film is involving despite it's overly clichÃ©d subject matter, it seems to present it in a fresh way. What makes this film the draw that it was, is the performances. Wow the performances!!!!!!! Sean Penn is amazing as the murdered young girl's father. His pain shows remarkably through his facade through each and every tear inducing scene. Marcia gay harden and Laura Linney make fine as the supporting wives. delivering meaningful and gut wrenchingly realistic performances. The film catches the desperation and guilt of all of it's characters not just the key players. although Tim Robbins is effective in his role he pales in comparison to the attractive young man whom plays the victims boyfriend. I dson't know who he is, but I know that guy is going places. The film dark and gloomy it's morbid texture never gives up letting in and inch of happiness. it's truly a delight to see a movie take itself so seriously and succeed. But I have to say that just having recently seen the film I think it wa somewhat over-hyped. Despite the acting, and clean cut direction the film sports mediocre touch ups. the story is interesting but somewhat formulaic and the score and cinematographic fit the film well but there's just nothing special there. alkl in all I must say it makes an interesting nights viewing. But this film is purely an actors showcase it gives them material and characters to work with. so that they can just throw themselves into the scenario and breathe life into mediocrity. 7/10",7,0,2,16 December 2004
War of the Worlds," The end of the world!
","The War of the Worlds Dreamworks/Paramount 2005 Color 117 mins. Sci-fi/Action Tom Cruise, Dakota Fanning, Justin Chatwin, Tim Robbins and Miranda Otto star. Directed by Steven Spielberg Written by H.G. Wells Rated PG-13 for terror, brutality, violence and gore. OK so who knew Mr. Speilvberg still had this in him. After the lame lineup of films he's turned out lately. It's surprising for him or even a big studio to go forth and make mega budget Horror flick. And thats what precisely this is. Don't be fooled this film is brutal like Saving Private Ryan brutal when Spielberg makes a film about way, he makes a film about war. Tom Cruise looking handsome as ever and in his best performance to date stars as the films central character. A middle class father whom is taking care of his daughter and son for the weekend. While their mother and her new beau head on over to her parents in Boston. All in the same day he gets off work and comes home to his resistant kids and the invasion begins. With a mounting sense of dread the film explodes into a full out brutal extermination. The aliens attack in their 50's movies inspired vehicles and decimate the population while him and his kids race cross country to find their mother in Boston. This is without a doubt the best film of the summer. It is also pretty much the best film of the year. Spielberg keeps things smart and engrossing. The movie is a sweaty palm inducing nightmare that only loses its nerve in the last act. Had the film had a bleak ending like everyone thought it may have been of the most disturbing films ever made. Spielberg has accomplished a glorious feat by taking the prospects of an alien invasion and making them seem real through holocaust and 911 references. Truly terrifying stuff here people. Tom Cruise I've a wonderful and Oscar worthy performance as the after and Dakota Fanning joins him in the same caliber. Another standout in the film is hottie Justin Chatwin who does an ice job by making his character memorable. i'm telling you right now when going to see War f the Worlds you have no idea what to expect, no matter how much I or whatever others tell you. Just be Read to cover your eyes and grab hold of your seat. A-",8,0,1,9 July 2005
Hitch," Not Bad
",Hitch has been making millions upon millions of dollars at the box office. And although the film falls into the majorly mediocre category it fares well as a watchable comic valentine. Wil Smith stars in fine comedic form as a the title character a date doctor of sorts who helps Good guys with no talking skills achieve the unattainable. Eva Mendez stars as a man hating gossip columnist whom becomes taken back by him after some laugh inducing situations until finally discovering his profession and questioning of she should expose him or not. The movie boasts some funny moments mostly not associated with the two leads and although the film lacks any type of originality overall or even a shred of believable chemistry it exhibits an energetic flare for keeping you watching. Although far from being a success it far from being a train wreck as well. Hitch lands a 6/10.,6,0,1,25 February 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," FLAWS ASIDE! A FANTASTIC FINALE!
","Well I'm sure many people will be like flaws, what flaws and you're too judgemental. But the truth of the matter is That although a bit lengthy in the end. The film is truly great! This is one hell of a crazy chapter finale in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. It picks up exactly where the second had left off. When they speak of days in between the two films you realize you've been waiting a whole year and it's increased your excitement. Frodo and Sam take the ring to be destroyed where it was made while followed by the multiple personality Gollum. While the war rages on as the armies of darkness draw near and have a final feud between the evil and the people of middle earth. That is pretty much the film simplified. It's most ultimately about the struggling forces of good and evil and this film has quite alot to say about it, and everything. So much that sometimes it's a bit confusing and your led a stray. The film is packed with thrills, emotions, suspense, laughs, tears galore. But it has so many charachters to feel strongly about all of them is quite a task. And you as the audience do manage too for a while. But some stories eventually loose their steam and some charachters never fully develop but are given heroic climaxes.  However no face is never completely unknown to you, it's the names that are the problem. On the techinal side the film is just beautiful. The cinematography is gorgeous, the direction is fast paced, the score is epic, the spfx at their best and the acting is good for what the film demands.  With of course another standout performance from the gorgeously perfect hearthrob Orlando Bloom. Sean Astin also does his finest at playing Sam but his charachter is given a bit too much screen time. Flaws aside this is indeed a fantastic finale. As with any trilogy the last episode always offers dissapointments in some way or another. But What has been done here is truly a feat it stays completely true to the book trilogy even when needing to extend certain things longer, or explain others in more depth. Overall don't walk rush out and go see this film event! It may not be a perfect film but it is most certainly one of the most entertaining.",9,0,0,17 December 2003
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A HORROR CLASSIC!
","I've been a fan of the elm st. films for many years. I grew up on them for god sakes. They were a staple of my childhood. I'm 25 now and with my box set DVD I still view them. As a kid the films terrified me, it was'nt until I got a little older that I realized the fun and humorous appeal they held. But this one was the start of Freddy. And he was in rare form here. Humorless, scary and nightmare inducing. Before all the one liners there was the original guy that nightmares were made of. The film centers around a group of friends most notably Johnny Depp and Heather Lagenkamp. One at a couple sleepover their friend Tina explains thats she had trouble sleeping because of horribly brutal nightmares. They all admit to having similar dreams as well. And from than on one by one their staked and murdered in their sleep. Creative death sequences and genuine suspense turned this ordinary slasher film into a horror classic. Including the general creativity of finding how a new way that a slasher/homicidal maniac can kill you. Looking back on this film now I still considerate great. But all compliments said the acting is a little off and some of the spfx and dialogue are marginably laughable. But it's a horror flick and even though I hold them to very high standards. It just wouldn't be one if it didn't have the slightest campy factor about it. All things said rush out and see A staple of the horror community. A nightmare on Elm st. the horror classic! 8/10",8,0,0,20 December 2004
Honey," As sweet as they come!
","In a time when films get more depressing in nature just for the holiday season. Honey stands alone as a prime example of goodness in this holiday season targeted obviously at youth but enjoyable to a huge majority. The story is extremely cliche and predictable. But hey who cares in a film you walk out of with a huge smile on your face. Although it has hints of campiness straight out of showgirls and glitter. It doesn't fare as bad as them.  Actually it's quite entertaining and the film's weak aspects are highlighted by decent performances, fabulous choreography and good chemistry.  Jessica Alba does what she can with the role. Some of the lines are a little cheesy but overall the film delivers more than it's supposed to. So for anyone whose looking for a nice, timid night out at the movies. Check out Honey, it's as sweet as they come.",8,0,2,7 December 2003
Fantastic Four," Fantastic
","FANTASTIC FOUR Fox 2005 Color 91 minutes Action-Fantasy Jessica Alba, Iaon Gruffurd, Michael Chicklis, Chris Evans and Julian McMahon star. Directed by Tim Story Rated PG-13 for adult themes and violence So how fantastic is the new comic book flick Fantastic Four. Well I'm happy to say that it's pretty fantastic. Now don't get me wrong this film is by no means intelligent, ground breaking, creative or even semi original. But it doesn't pretend to be. it's nothing more than dumb fun and it's slightly refreshing to a see a film of such caliber. Director Tim Story of the highly enjoyable and under appreciated Taxi takes a hot cast of 5 and turns four of them into a superhero squad and one of them into a villain. thats basically the premise it's not much more except that they fight. And yes they actually really do fight. The spfx are pretty good and well used and the acting is acceptable for the film. Surprisingly Jessica Alba looks gorgeous and doesn't suck too bad. Ioan Gruffurd of King Arthur fame does a nice job of filling out his hunky suit. Making him the film's more mature looking and minded sexy guy. Michael Chicklis looks very cool and plays the part well as the Thing. Julian McMahon of Nip/Tuck turns in a sexy performance as Doom and the standout performance here is really mega sexy Chris Evans. whose undeniable comic appeal and likability makes him the films real star. Plus the fact if it was just him waling around near naked or in aform fitting suit the entire film that would along be the price of a movie ticket. God look at those abs and that ass. Whew! alright let me stop. Anyways the film is dumb fun. The first real summer flick to come out this year in my opinion. Check it out! you won't be disappointed if you know what to expect.

A Walk to Remember," What A Suprise!!!!
","I went to see this film with a friend to make fun of it. And found myself totally enthralled by this small but emotionally engrossing film with a breakout performance from singer Mandy Moore. She stars as a religious young woman who ends up changing the bad boy in school and making him fall for her.  it's beautifully done with great performances, good music and a suprisingly emotional and honest edge.",9,1,2,6 August 2003
The Island," Fantatsic Island!!!!!!!
","THE ISLAND Dreamworks/Warner Bros. 2005 Color 127 minutes Action-Thriller Scarlett Johansen, Ewan Mcgregor, Steve Buschemi, Sean Bean and Dijimon Honsou star. Directed by Michael Bay Rated PG-13 for language, violence and sexuality. I just returned from a screening of the summers best film. Hopefully not hiring your expectations to much. I hope to expose the film a bit so that it can find more of an audience. I'm not sure there's much anticipation for it. Even though there should be. Flowing with creativity, intelligence, wondrous action sequences and a truly ground breaking storyline. Sexy Ewan Mcgregor and stunner Scarlett Johansen star as Lincoln and Jordan two supposed people living in a fake utopia. Genrated by a company they discover their clones and the purpose of their existence after winning the supposedly random lottery to go to the last remaining paradise the Island. But they soon discover there is no island and the reason for living is because they're being sponsored by rich people so that after their body parts have outlived their usefulness they can replace them with theirs. Slightly disturbing I know. They soon end up on the run and thats when the Michael Bay kicks in. With one exciting action set piece after another. Filling the film witch subtle and seemingly realistic special effects the film keeps you grounded in emotion and hanging on to the edge of your seat. Besides the films undeniable contents it sports memorable performances from its cast, Michael Bays best direction, a spectacular score and colorful cinematographic. This is the bets film I've seen all summer and possibly the year. I don't want to hype this film up for anyone but it's what I feel. I'm sure others will not agree but no one will walk out feeling dissatisfied. Cause it's a rare feat to balance intelligence with action and this film succeeds. So please give this film the business it deserves and check it out. A",10,7,33,9 July 2005
