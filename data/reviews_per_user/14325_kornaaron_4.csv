Gremlins," brilliant
",I've always loved this film but i recently got the chance to see it at a local cinema. What can i say i was blown away. In that one viewing i actually realised why it to me is such a good film. Its dark and violet while also being funny and at some points the chaos is even poetic. It has the perfect balance of horror and humour to make it an engrossing and even thought provoking film which most people will remember long after the film has ended.There is not much more i can say other than watch this film.i rate this film 9.5,9,0,2,13 October 2006
Alexander," a true modern epic - review of final cut
","I first saw this film in it's theatrical cut and thought it was pretty but nothing more, but recently i was compelled to watch the final cut. After putting it off for a while due to it's 3 and a half hour length i finally got round to watching it.what can i say i was completely blown away the first 3 hours were truly stunning, beautifully filmed and wonderfully acted, my previous ideas on the film were destroyed. the final half hour i found dragged on a bit but it was a fitting ending to a stunning epic.In my view the final cut has made a very average film into an incredible, sweeping epic. It is truly something when a film can go from being a 4 star film to a 9 star film in ones mind.If you can view it in High definition as I have also done as this makes it even more of a spectacle and a true modern epic.",9,2,4,19 January 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," awesome
","Before watching the film I was very sceptical of whether it would be any good as I found the second film was becoming more mainstream. Boy I was surprised. The film was brilliant, some of the set - pieces in it had to be seen to be believed and I was in awe by the end. I was slightly disappointed that the tone of the film was not darker than it was , (it was dark but I found there was possibly to many comedic moments).All in all it really is a brilliant conclusion to the series and in my view better than the second film but not quite as good as the first.9/10",9,18,30,24 May 2007
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," heavy going but amazing
","I finally got round to watching this film after putting it off for a week. boy was it amazing, heavy going but amazing. the scope of the film is truly stunning as is everything else in the film. the acting is pretty much perfect (probably Brad Pitts best role) and the cinematography is truly remarkable. many have said that he film is boring. to some it may be but although not much happens every minute is gripping and brilliant. when the final scene rolls you'll breath a deep sigh because the experience is over. this truly is one of the most remarkable films I have seen. It's one of those films you will never forget and an experience that will stay with you for a long time to come.",10,2,5,24 February 2008
