Ali," An incredible journey
","I honestly cannot understand the negative reviews of this movie. It is a spectacularly directed, fabulously acted, and greatly-written masterpiece! Unlike other biopics with jump from childhood to adulthood, simply showing us more of a documentary-like look at the subjects life instead a single, consistent story, this film delivers an incredible real-life journey for the greatest boxer of all time, Muhammad Ali. The film covers a ten-year period, between 1964 and 1974. It begins with Ali winning his title from Sonny Liston, and shortly after converting to the Nation of Islam. The film shows how turbulent the times were in the 1960s. Black people everywhere were fighting for their rights, and in different ways. Martin Luthor King Jr. was a devout Christian who preached patience and peace, while Malcolm X represented the Nation of Islam, which was understandably outraged by the discrimination against them, and demanded fair treatment. Ali is obviously a Muslim, and a close friend of Malcolm X's. However, things start to dissolve for Ali after his conversion. The demands of the Nation of Islam and their radical leader Elijah Muhammad force Ali to challenge his friendships and marriage. But he stands by it, even to the point where he is stripped of his Heavyweight Title and threatened with Jail Time for standing up for his religious beliefs. But instead of backing him in this time of crisis, the Nation abandons him. However, Muhammad is fiercely loyal, never turning is back on the Nation, despite his frustrations. The Nation even goes so far as to suspend Muhammad from the practice of Islam. Muhammad stands up for two principals: He never stopped being a Muslim, and he never stopped being the champ. His two goals are to continue in his beliefs, and to win back his title, appealing to the Nation of Islam, and fighting everyone he has to to get to the World Champion. This all takes it's toll on Ali, from his first humiliating defeat in the ring, to even straining his marriage with his wife Belinda. Ali is not drawn as the upright and flawless hero. He is shown having an affair not behind his wife's back, but in front of news cameras. But however flawed the man may be, he sticks by his principals. His marriage going down the toilet, he demands, does not plead for, the approval of the Nation of Islam, and battles legendary fights with Joe Fazier and George Foreman. All of Ali's frustrations and troubles over the past ten years are brought to a boiling point by the film's climactic battle, which chronicles what is widely renowned as the greatest boxing match of all time.Overall, not only is this an incredible journey, but it is fascinating to watch a film directed by Michael Mann, to see the cinematography, film editing, and how it fits with the music. One thing is for sure:Ali is a winner, and still champion!",10,1,2,21 July 2006
Rocky IV," The last great Rocky movie.
","Let's face it. All of the first four Rocky movies are great. (The fifth one is one of the most notorious films of all time, alongside such classics as Highlander II: The Quickening.) In my opinion, 'Rocky IV' is the second-best of the bunch, next to the original, then III, and then II. In Rocky, we got to see the classic story of a down-on-his-luck prize-fighter getting a shot at the title, and going fifteen rounds with the World Champion. In II, he actually won the title, in III, he showed us the Eye of the Tiger, and in IV, he takes on the Soviet Union, in boxing of course. Seemingly inspired by the 1980 Miracle on Ice, 'Rocky IV' tells another story of the Cold War being fought in sports, with Rocky once again being the underdog,a nd taking on a gigantic Soviet behemoth, played by Dolph Lundren (first Mr. T, then Dolph Lundren; how can you beat that?). It goes without saying that Rocky IV is the cheesiest of the bunch, with he Soviet having to be an enormously powerful man, whose power is often over exaggerated, but that's part of what makes it so entertaining. The battle is also very personal for Rocky, and this movie is, in some ways, the most intense of the series. It also has the best training montage, and some other great musical numbers. Certainly the best of the bunch movie-wise.The series should have ended with IV, but we had to endure the dismal V, and now, goodness help us, we're going to have a Rocky VI. Oh well, at least we'll always be able to remember these first four great movies. Rent them!'Hearts on fire!'",10,1,4,2 June 2006
