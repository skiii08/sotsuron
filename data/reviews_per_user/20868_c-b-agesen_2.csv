The King's Speech," This is how exceptional acting can make a movie brilliant!
","Before watching this for the first time, and yes this was the first out of many and certainly not the last, I was kind of skeptical of the plot. A King who has a problem making public appearances sounded kind of boring to me, but man was I wrong about that.This movie is from the very beginning an exceptional study in how great lead and supporting acting can make a rather insignificant story to become much more than that. First of all a much well deserved Oscar to Colin Firth for the lead role as the King, his acting as a speech-impaired prince/king actually makes the viewer absolutely speechless and he makes you feel for the character (even though he is a King and all that :-)). He could have carried the movie all by himself with mediocre performances by the rest and it would still be a great movie. However, Geoffrey Rush and Helena B. Carter supports him to perfection, I would have liked to see at least one Oscar going that way as well.I think that many others have done a fine job in reviewing this movie and explaining the historical background of the movie, so I will not bore you with that.Will only say that if you are a fan of watching a well written scrip combined with world class acting, then you already have your answer of whether or not to watch this movie - It's a sure MUST see and maybe see again, think it will move you every time.This movie has it all - key points are obviously superb acting, good scenes of humor, lots of brilliant emotional scenes, nice script flow. Only explanation to why this movie is not rated higher in top 250 movies on IMDb is the fact that the story itself is maybe not that appealing to some people (including my prejudices before watching it). The acting really does the job and because of that a well deserved Best Picture of the year award was indisputable! Watch it and enjoy if you have not already watched it, and if so watch it again :-)",10,0,0,23 September 2013
This Is the End," What is going on!!!
","This is seriously one of the worst movies ever made and I feel compelled to tell all who is just thinking on spending a dime on this useless movie if you can even call it that - don't do it!. Only good thing about the movie was Michael Cera who had approx. 2 mins all in all. (Funny stuff by him), but as a movie it sucked in every category imaginable; script, acting, special effects....the list is long, too long for me to even have the energy to continue this review. But I will say one last thing and that is 'how the hell is it possible to get the rating of 7.1'? IMDb should really soon create some sort of ghost-review detection, because no way in hell would this movie get above 3 avg. If someone had not boosted it with multiple tens. Cant believe it - create a shitty movie with well known actors and get away with it by tricking the audience on IMDb. Robbery in broad daylight if you ask me.",1,37,72,20 October 2013
