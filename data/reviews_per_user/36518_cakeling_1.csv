Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Less violence, more brutality?
","As someone who has never really been a big Tarantino fan, I wasn't expecting to enjoy either volume of Kill Bill. However, the first defied my expectations and was one of my favourite films of last year, and Vol. 2 in my opinion betters it. If you're after more of what you saw in Vol. 1, this movie may not be for you, but if the characters piqued your interest then Vol. 2 should offer you plenty. QT cuts back on the violence to the extent that it simply serves to punctuate the chapters, but the brutality of the first is exceeded because this film is far more personal. The story of Bill and The Bride really is a tragic one (although the comic touches throughout keep the film from being depressing), and is definitely worth telling. Uma Thurman was made for this role and plays it to perfection, with the rest of the cast complementing her with excellent performances.It's not as much fun as Vol. 1, that much is certain, but I believe that it stands up better on its own as well as providing a fantastic conclusion to the first volume.",9,0,1,18 April 2004
