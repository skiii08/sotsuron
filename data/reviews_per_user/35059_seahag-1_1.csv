3:10 to Yuma," Good build up, but a horribly written ending
","Those of you who voted higher for this, I just don't get. No matter how good the acting is, you can't make up for a poorly thought out story line; which this movie has in abundance. Maybe its my background as a corrections officer and having to 'escort' inmates that made me look at this with a more critical eye; but its ridiculous how much 'help' Crowe's character gives to his captor in getting him to the train on time over unbelievably stupid odds, and with no advantage of their own (ie. superior firepower, secret route). Knowing that Ben Wade's gang would be coming for their 'Boss', they add another layer of difficulty by holing up in a motel room across town, instead of taking the prisoner directly to the train station and holding him there....Its completely asinine. Movies that insult your intelligence do not deserve an 8+ rating; and there is no way this is 'the best western since unforgiven' as the commercials suggest. I'd give that nod to Open Range.",Null,2,7,12 September 2007
