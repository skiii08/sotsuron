The Blair Witch Project," Scary As Hell
","Without ANY views of the Blair Witch or barely any gore, this movie manages to scare the HELL out of you.Simply the part where they find the cross tick things sends shivers down your spine.The most frightening part, though, is the very ending.The ending which is now so famous, for scaring people out of camping.This movie did, for me, put me off camping, just like swimming in a beach like from Jaws.Basic plot outline is that three student filmmakers go into remote woods to film a documentary on the local legend, The Blair Witch. Upon interviewing many of the locals, they discover that the supposed Blair Witch is a woman who was tied down in the forest and everyone thought she was dead, or something like that. Half the children from the town started to disappear, and then sightings of a woman covered in thick hair (hippie!). Hence the Blair Witch.The last leg of the documentary is when the three friends go into the forest to hike, when they get lost and encounter their worst fear, the Blair Witch. They must now try to navigate themselves out of the forest and away from a terror no one can ever imagine...Scary As Hell.",10,1,3,25 September 2005
Jaws," A Classic
","Jaws. (1975) Action-Horror I first saw parts of Jaws when I was 8. I watched until the little boy was eaten. I turned it off.Two years later...I turned it back on.A few years later...Here I am writing this comment.Jaws is a classic, the story, the acting, the now-famous soundtrack and of course- the infamous shark that kept viewers out of the water for decades to come.The plot of Jaws is the story of a New York cop who moves to an island named Amity to live with his wife and children.One morning, a teenager comes to him saying he found a body on one of the beaches on Amity, he investigates, and finds that the body is heavily mutilated.He suspects a shark attack.He suspects right, he warns the mayor of the town that a rogue shark is loose and that he should close all beaches until they are sure that the shark is dead, or has gone completely. The mayor is ignorant, and keeps the beaches open for a 4th of July vacation-party thing.Despite the security around the waters, a little boy is eaten by the shark.The situation quickly escalates...Men arrive on boats with high powered rifles to catch the shark for a reward, set out by the mayor. They fail as another victim is taken.The mayor is then pressured to hire an infamous fisher who demands a high price for the shark.Togethor, the New York cop,Martin Brody, the fisherman,Quint, and a marine biologist must travel to the outskirts of the island the capture and kill the shark.While Quint becomes more intent on killing the shark, and collecting his reward, Martin becomes more worried if they'll survive the experience...This movie is the mother of all shark films. Idiots who think this is bad because the shark effects are a bit outdated obviously have no real respect. You can't compare this to other pathetic shark films like 'Open Water' or 'Jaws 4'. This is a classic. It will remain one of the greatest, and it will always open our imagination, and our fear, of going into the unknown, into the water.Highly, highly recommended, 9/10",9,1,3,18 July 2005
Casino Royale," For the first time in years, the Bond series is heading in a promising direction...easily one of the years top films.
","Casino Royale is the Bond film many have been praying for for years. A Bond film not stuffed with special effects. A Bond film not filled with ridiculous gadgets. A Bond film without Brosnan. Their time has come.Casino Royale is, without a doubt, one of the years greatest films, if not, the best (though I haven't seen The Departed yet)films this year. Casino Royale is, very much, back to basics. In a good way. Daniel Craig has outdone himself as Bond, despite all the scrutiny surrounding his appointment as Bond. He is a worthy Bond and he acts well. The villains etc are picked very well, and a quick cameo from Richard Branson went down well with me. Some very memorable moments, ie when bad guys are chasing Bond at an airport when a landing jet raises the throttle, and in doing so completely blows the bad guys car flying off the runway. The poker game is a tense and memorable sequence, along with the start and finish.As for the Bond girl, she was much better than expected. Mysterious, and an all new take on the Bond girl.The theme song is surprisingly catchy and very much suits the movie and the opening sequence, which is a great opening sequence, and an ending that will blow you away, and have you leaving the cinema thinking: 'Truly, James Bond has been born again'. Hopefully it stays this way. No more stupid gadgets. I know I've said it before but, the end was an absolute beauty. Perfect. The whole cinema was roaring with delight. Bond is born again.Great film, great action, great...everything. Some moments that had you gaping, and had you smiling. A promising look for the Bond films to come in time. Go see it. You won't be disappointed.10/10",10,1,3,8 December 2006
