Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Number One and the best of the lot!
","This was supposed to be number one in the story so far as a prequel, and in my mind it is the best of them all: Hollywood moguls would you please re-edit and include all the deleted scenes, especially the Gun-Gan Sub additions:Absolutely monster movie, with fantastic cast. Anything with Liam Neeson has got to be great: I just cannot fault this movie with or without any want of spite. If you like S/W then this is the one, in hindsight of seeing all the others. Cracking performance from Jake Lloyd as the young Anakin. Where are you now mate, get back in there...Great story line faultless to the core, 'The planet core'!!!! Sorry just could not resist. The Pod Race, well sheer genius from the master himself, what more can I really say...No 5 of my all time Dessert Island Top 20. I have surely have lived.",10,2,3,9 June 2007
Deja Vu," Deja Vu....(Yes precisely!!!).
","Well for my Â£4 from Blockbsuter, I thought I would vent my disappointment, on what could have been another Washington masterpiece: Allow me to give a short lesson in Deja Vu! Sorry for the pun...As a composer of great music (Myself!) we all know there are only 7 notes to a music scale, upon a number of varying differentiations...Therefore, the old saying, 'That song sounds like so and so', occurs!...This movie was 7 films rolled into one...1.Minority Report 2.Enemy of The State 3. (Seven) 4. (24) 5.Back To The Future (Without the comedy) 6. Telefon 7.Timecop: Hollywood must have thought I'm bored today, what shall we go and do? Lets spend a few hundred million on a movie, to make a few hundred million! This was the season of boredom. Have we been here before? Mr D's acting pace, was a poor attempt in timing to change characters, that have been played before. Good but not convincing enough I'm afraid: Val Kilmer and John Caviezel stole the show here and good on them!!! How IMDb can say that Casino Royale' is similar viewing, beggars belief...Must go now I've been here before, perhaps its Deja Vu!!!",6,0,1,31 May 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Not Bad For 12 Year Olds! (Not good, if you don't travel well!).
","Hybrid cross between,WATERWORLD/NO ESCAPE/MAD MAX, with a touch of TREASURE ISLAND! Gone very very skew whiff!!! Well hold on me matey's ere' you'll need a tough intestine to stomach this riddle: If you like see food, be warned! This Film is not a bad tale of yode! 'The buts and if only's'. 'Not a lot really'. The acting in the first 20 minutes of the cut, was as wooden as the ships! The usual Thespian clique cast, did not really perform, bar one or two: The story was well OTT! The stunts were amazing and credibly workable:I can see where we are going with Ms knightley, best of luck to her! Credible performances from Bill Nighey and Orlando Bloom held this colourful tale together: Captain Depp seemed to take second place, in this cinematic screen extravaganza. Loved the accent (Cross between Michael Barrymore and Tommy Cooper with a sore throat!): The movie,must now hold the world record, for the largest cooked Calamari at sea! For the escapism and the lovely scenery, it was worth the two and a half hour holiday! Other than that if you have sensitive children like mine, I would not advise it! Sorry guys, but stick to the Sword Fighting. Sailing Ships full of ghouls, that go under the water, are for parties where other substances get consumed::::",7,0,0,31 August 2006
The Transporter," 'The Transporter '(Does what it says on the tin) And More!
","Don't you just love it? Small bit part non 'luvvie' actor, ex Olympic Sports star,makes it big in what is an all time cult classic, post 2000 movie: Jason Statham, what a scorcher of a casting choice: The movie, it speaks for itself in drones: Ex special forces hero, turns high octane,low profile, delivery man! At a price: TC. Must be reeling at the thought of not doing this gem: The chemistry between Statham and the 'Classic Francios Berleand' was hypnotic: What a pairing!!! The only 'iffy' moment was some of the fight scenes and the greasy oil spill routine in the garage:Makes 'Bond' look totally pedestrian! By the way,watch this space for a future 'Bond' candidate, in the Connery mould. Look no further than Monsieur Statham: Apart from that! Can you Transport us some more please? Very please!",9,0,0,27 August 2006
Cars," Cars The Movie
","If you read (IMDb:Blue Cheese) you wont need to go and see the film, No sorry, only joking! This is a great formula movie for all the family, from the Pixar stable: A good storyline based on the sort of Roadhouse/Doc Hollywood theme but cartoon animated, with Hot Rod motor vehicles: The usual high profile superstar voice overs, are in situe! The graphics are out of this world and are the shape of more to come: The race scenes are as good as any. The story dropped off slightly in the middle 20 minutes, but to true to form it picked up and finished off to the usual crescendo> A very good movie, worthy of the entrance fee and buying it on DVD: The music soundtrack is one of the best, as usual provided mainly by Randy Newman.",8,0,0,19 August 2006
Transformers," Cracking movie 'Im alive again'!
","Absolute celluloid monster CGI-fest of a movie. If your going to play with Computer graphics then do it this way ala' the whole hog. Transformers is a blockbusting stormer of a movie: After being asleep for the last 18 months with the usual Hollywood drawl. Out comes this cataclysmic cracker: The story and concept, is as old as Japanese samurai books, think (5 Rings, by musashi): However this sci-fi electro fest, ticks all the right boxes, in the right places: Megan Fox & Shia LeBouf, oh yes very much bang bang, on target and well worth the side splitting entertainment: My only sour grape is Ron Witwicky/Kevin Dunn. You played the identical stereotypical uncle Sam Pa Pa in 'Small Solders'. Come on Casting Execs does it have to be that obvious! Rachael Taylor/Maggie Madsen the part was far too overplayed, has anyone told you that Method Acting, does not relate, to you raising your voice or shouting through the whole of the scene, badly directed in my view. The rest of the movie was an action cracker in the most highest of terms. Its going to sell trillions on DVD...Loved Bumblebee in his new set of Camaro clothes,'I want one now': Great,great movie, brilliant story, cohesive, realistic, original. I would like to see it again. TRANSFORM !!!",10,6,11,2 August 2007
Jerry Maguire," Great movie for the moment ! Good for the Time:
","Another T.C. vehicle movie, this time in the comedy/morality mode. Cruise reprises some old characters from previous celluloid to create Jerry Maguire. Very much a mix of Joel (Risky Business), Brian Flannagan (Cocktails), Charlie Babbit (Rain Man) and Mitch McDeere (The Firm) rolled into one quite entertaining package. Zellweger, as the love interest at her absolute finest! forget Bridget: Cuba Gooding Jr in his well deserved Oscar Acadamy award winning role, as the frustrated NFL front man, was impeccable. This is a moral tale tinged with a funny theme to it. Whether in real life uncles Sam, reality would prevail, only the great one himself knows. But nevertheless, this was a thought provoking 139 minutes, that was well worked, scripted,edited and cut.I would watch this movie over and over again, cuddled up to my lovely wife, with a packet of popcorn any day!",9,2,5,22 November 2006
A Clockwork Orange," 'The Greatest of Them All'
","It is extremely difficult to attempt to offer any decent modicum of comment to a cinematic masterpiece. Very much akin in analysing whether the Mona Lisa is beautiful or not! This piece of celluloid history is unfathomable, in its quest for one reason alone, it will always leave questions to be asked, to which there could be many answers, yet still leave many questions unanswered! Kubrick Direction and Screenplay. The esoteric vision of Burgess! Let us all get down on our knees and pay homage'. Freudian/Jung/Sarte'. This is the total package: The Acting is a masterclass display all round, of how the profession should be applied: There is no weak points in this film: There are no negatives. Your only duty, is to allow yourself to indulge in this piece of 70s history and enjoy! This movie will never be replicated, in any lifetime: Take the opportunity while you can.",10,0,1,25 September 2006
National Treasure," What A Cracker (In The words of Frank Carson)
","Well what can I say! Lets try, This was the Blue Ribband of the 2005 action three. IE Sahara/Stealth and this Gem: Casting was near perfect, apart from the fact, that I keep getting Deja-Vu' thinking that I am seeing Sean Bean playing similar roles, (Admittedly he was not that bad). The story was fantastic, no real dodgy moments! I saw it on the big screen, bought it on DVD, watch it at least once every two months, no problems it is as fresh as when I was en thrilled by it on its first occasion: I'm very glad that there was none of the usual mushy bits, the chemistry between Cage and Kruger was the right balance:This is a great piece of history put in a story which could actually sound feasible! The Masonic connection was excellent, possibly a good Public relations exercise for 'The Fraternal Brotherhood'; I wonder. 'Could that be the sequel': (Copyright please?).Only joking!!!",10,0,3,20 August 2006
The Da Vinci Code," What A Disappointment Oh Dear!
","Well well! I told myself so! The Davinci Code was and is probably one of the most over hyped pieces of celluloid in the last 10 years. Well done Mssr Brown, with the book,one wonders, how many of the 40 million or so readers, went traipsing around Europe, seeking clues to the H.G. After reading the tale. The movie! Massive disappointment, something told me not to bother with going to see it on cinema, after renting it, I can see why! Being part Venitian I feel some what bemused, as to what all the fuss was about: This tale of ode, appeared to be nothing more than an empty vessel: Without Jean Reno and Audrey Tautou, the film would have been related to the cheap bin on release! The lead role cast was not appropriate and should have gone to someone like Michael Caine. The ending was rushed, faster than the finish to a Formula One race: very poor indeed, (National Treasure 2) please instead.",6,1,2,12 November 2006
Iron Man," Truly fabulous movie, slightly spoilt in minute areas
","Out of all the Marvel and DC genre movies, Iron Man must top the lot in all areas. A truly fabulous blockbuster of a movie all round. (Definately worth seeing at any time and most definitely worth buying for any home cribs, movie collection). Unfortunately what ruined the celluloid cliffhanger for me, in not making it a stellar 10 out of 10, was the erratic casting, absolutely great in 50% of it, but the other half was dire and un thought of,(Some of the supporting cast,left a lot be desired). Areas of the production was a bit patchy and incoherent, only masked by the noise and fast pace of the story line. The swansong ending of the movie, appeared to be a rehash of 'Transformers'. The feel,action, sound and music was all reminiscent of last years kiddie blockbuster. For all die hard super hero fans, Iron Man was true to its storyline and comic history. There is no need to allay any attempt, to be smart and try to be clever about the facts and figures, of the life and storyline of Tony Stark.. The movie spelt it out in droves. It could have been perfect, but as with anything metal, it all has its imperfections, the sequel could become in danger, of getting very rusty!!!!!",9,1,2,31 May 2008
Casino Royale," Second Best Bond Ever To: OHMSS
","This is the big one, out come all the Barrack Room hacks. Here we go!Possibly the second best Bond Film of all time, depicting the prequel/pro-log of the infamous, wet and dry disposal expert on behalf of Her Majesty. The casting of Dan Craig was spot on no doubts here,as the man delivering the box of chocolates, after disposing all the usual wannabe delivery boys. Great story from Fleming possibly one of his best, based on a number of various alleged war time tales of experience. The casting and storyline was fluent and cohesive, to the point of total originality. I am unsure on the 'Vesper Lynd' depiction, but after watching the movie on my 10th outing, I think I get the message. One sad point for me personally was the film score, which was its only issue. The opening title theme was a very good piece of work, which was slightly spoilt to the fact that the composer should have let someone else perform it. Admittedly they themselves are an allegedly world acclaimed vocalist and writer. The opening title credits were the best in Bond cinematic history: Great storyline. A little bit of useless information, which will have astrologers jumping for joy. The other great Bond new boy with a similar story line was George Lazenby 'Virgo' Sun sign. Opposite polarity to Daniel Craig 'Pisces' (The best by the way, I'm one too!)David Niven Casino Royale Bond spoof was a 'Pisces'. Eva Green 'Cancer' Ideal paring for and match for a Piscean in Synastry: Someone got it right doing their homework, or did the Cards just give them a 'Straight Flush'.",9,0,5,8 May 2007
