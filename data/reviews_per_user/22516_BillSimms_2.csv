Raiders of the Lost Ark," The greatest adventure movie ever !!!
","I was 14 when this film first came out. It was instant love for me. Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones was the greatest adventurer i had ever seen on the screen.The combination of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas working together was a very exciting prospect, and they delivered one hundred percent. From the opening scene until the end credits i was glued to the screen, and enjoyed every second of it. It was also my introduction to actors that i would come to love over the years, such as Karen Allen, John Rhys-Davies and Alfred Molina. This is a film that when ever it crosses my mind, it is with the deepest and greatest adulation.As far as i am concerned Raiders of the lost ark is the greatest adventure film ever made. It is a film that set a new standard, to which all films of action and adventure there after, could only strive to compare.",10,0,0,17 August 2016
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The Film that started a Universe.
","What can i say about this film that hasn't already been said? I was 11 years old when this movie came out, a perfect age for a boy to fall in love with this whole new universe filled with all these amazing aliens and characters. I first saw it on television a couple of years later, and i remember taping it all off on to my tape recorder. I must have listened to those tapes a hundred times over as i would read my star wars comic books. It would be a few years later with the creation of the VHS recorder and tapes, before i would get to finally see it in its entirety over and over again. I did get to see the re-release of all three of the original films in theatre finally in 1997.Forty years later and i still love this film as much today as i ever did. So many epic scenes to love like the Darth Vader and Ben Kenobi lightsaber battle.",10,0,0,27 August 2017
