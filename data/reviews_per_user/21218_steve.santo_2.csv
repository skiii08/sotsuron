The Blair Witch Project," Don't believe the Hype!
","While this movie claimed to be 'The scariest movie since the Exorcist' I failed to see the horror in this picture. I will admit that the concept was original, however, it lacked any substance. I got a headache for the way it was filmed and was tired of hearing Heather Donahue's constant screaming. The only thing scary about the movie was the History of the Blair Witch and the fact the title has Linda Blair's last name in it. Don't insult me by making a parallel to a real horror classic.",1,1,3,21 December 1999
The Exorcist," Still packs a Horrible Knock Out Punch
","I originally saw this movie when I was 12yrs old. The same age as the main character Regan who gets possessed. My older cousins kept talking about the movie and I nagged my parents until my father snuck me to the theater w/o telling my mom. I need not tell you that I am still scarred from this movie.When I originally saw the movie, I only made it about 1/2 through then had to leave the theater. I didn't see the movie start to finish until I was 16 and was still terrified.Now that I gained some perspective I bought the 25th Anniversary edition of the movie and watched with some objectivity. It wasn't as scary when viewing it through the eyes of 30+ year old. The effects seemed dated, and I was able to focus on the movie rather than just the gore/shock value.It was actually an extremely well made movie! The fact that this happens to an innocent 12yr old girl is excellent. It certainly would not have the same effect if it was a 30 old man. If you are religious, you will be undoubtedly sucked into believing the possibility that something like this could actually happen.To me that is the strength of this movie. While some things in this movie appear to be not credible I found myself still believing that it COULD HAPPEN. I kept saying to myself, 'How could this be happening?' Yet it still seemed believable.While it didn't scare me the same way it did 20 years ago, it is still the best horror movie I've ever seen. After watching it I felt drained. I was tense the entire time I was watching it. Like I had been crazy a rollercoster ride. With all the garbage that is put out today, this movie will only endure over time.Also, for all you young 'kids' who thought it was actually funny. I challenge you to watch it in a dark room by yourself. Not with a group of friends poking fun at it. I guarantee you this film will have a much different effect.",Null,0,0,21 December 1999
