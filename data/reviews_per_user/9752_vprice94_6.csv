Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Masterpiece? LOL!
","I watched this for the 1st time last night on television (11 May 2018).Pros:
<ul><li>Michael Madsen receiving a grilling from his boss</li><li>Mei's temple training</li><li>Daryl Hannah was hot as hell.</li></ul>Cons:
<ul><li>Uma Thurman possessed zero grace and poor sword-wielding skills. She stomped about like Brigitte Nielsen in Red Sonya</li><li>She also cannot act</li><li>The long-winded (and equally annoying) speech made by David Carradine as he prepared a sandwich for his daughter</li><li>The dialogue was yawn-inducing. Stop droning on and get to the f_ckin' point.</li></ul>",Null,2,4,12 May 2018
It," F-ckin' LOL at the 'masterpiece' reviews!
","Anyone that believes this picture is a masterpiece is a bad tit. I'm not even gonna compare it to the 1990 mini-series because I thought that was a load of old cobblers too. However, there is at least 1 redeeming feature from the 1990 version, and that is the criminally underrated Tim Curry.The 2017 update relies heavily on the so called: jump scare; something I find utterly irritating in modern horror. I cannot think of anything more mundane than a non-scary visual accompanied by a loud noise stab to get a reaction from an audience. Just f-ck right off with that silly shite. Aside from some dodgy looking CGI the production values appear pretty good for the most part; although the 'abandoned house' reminded me of The 'Burbs (1989).Also, how weird-looking is Sophia Lillis (Beverley)? I actually thought she was related to Bill Skarsg√•rd (Pennywise) what with her odd shaped face. In fact, her freaky mush creeped me out throughout the running-time, so I guess that's 1 genuine scare from this below-average horror.",Null,22,45,11 September 2017
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Just not feeling it
","I enjoy history. I enjoy seeing it replicated upon the screen. I just didn't gain any enjoyment viewing this picture.The cast is fine - particularly Brad Pitt who I feel has got better with age. The cinematography is good and I genuinely felt I was observing a slice of the late Sixties. The problem, however, is the dialogue. It is yawn-inducing. The pacing is slow and the story is incredibly uneventful. I also found the narration a strange addition too.Just to highlight how tedious the picture is, I honestly cannot recall any dialogue. The only 2 scenes that I can remember - from the 150 minute running time - is Bruce Lee and the flamethrower. That's it.The picture is certainly worth 1 watch; but it is unlikely I will ever revisit it for a second viewing. I'm just glad I watched it online because I would feel disappointed if I had paid for a cinema ticket.",Null,24,38,15 August 2019
Arrival," Yeah, I get the plot...
","Now what?So Banks (Amy Adams) has memories of a future not yet occurred.And?Is this happening with any other individual who has come into contact with the aliens?I mean, where is this story going? Is it a personal take on a wider experience?The CGI was great in its subtleness and the acting was measured; but the story failed to ignite in to anything punchy.A very muted watch.",Null,2,2,10 March 2019
Godzilla," Plodzilla
","How on earth can one make a boring monster movie? Well, Gareth Edwards did just that. The King Of Monsters only appears for 9 minutes within his own movie (120 minute running time) which means we're left to observe crap actors with zero chemistry and appeal. If you haven't seen it, simply head over to YouTube and watch the Godzilla highlights, which cuts out the civilian banality. Thank goodness Edwards turned down the chance to direct Godzilla 2019.",Null,0,0,21 May 2019
Alien: Covenant," Stupid Explorers and Predictable Script
","I shan't bore you (or me) to death with a long-winding review. I've just got back from a 12:30 showing (12 May) and I just want to put my feet up and have a nice cup of tea.So... straight out of the stupid book, let me highlight the gormless colonists'/explorers' actions:*SPOILERS*1. Don't venture off to another planet to check out a message/climate. I don't care if you don't want to hop back into your sleeping chambers. Compose your heads and get back to your original mission. 2. Don't wonder off to relieve yourself in a unfamiliar forest. Either hold it in, or whip it out where you and your skin pipe can be seen. 3. Don't probe unfamiliar vegetation. It could have spores; and they could become airborne. Why take a risk? 4. Don't hug an infected man that is gyrating like a kid with ADHD whacked out on blue Smarties. What's wrong with you? 5. Don't transmit 'Quick, help!' messages to your colleagues and not be clear. 'You're breaking up, repeat!' Gimme a break. 6. Don't sit on the floor so an alien life-form can pounce on you. Pick your arse up and kick the little bastard. 7. Don't come running in all guns blazing like Duke Nukem and then slip on the floor. You'll look a right tit. 8. Don't aimlessly shoot your firearm and ignite fuel canisters. 9. Don't separate yourself in little groups in a unfamiliar alien building. Stick together; don't wonder off; make a plan; ask questions. 10. Don't wonder off and wash your face in a darkly lit room. Tend to your hygiene and wounds within the group. 11. Don't look into the egg chamber. Of course it isn't 'perfectly safe', you berk. 12. Don't go near David when he's holding his reed instrument. He'll either force you to carry a tune, or stick it in your windpipe.Also, I cannot tell if the film makers thought they were being clever with the android deception? As soon as the David/Walter kung-fu session was over, it was blatantly clear it was David all along. I mean, even a brain-damaged lettuce leaf would know that. The conclusion felt off too; as I didn't expect the film to close when it did. There were around 20 people at the screening and I heard a collective groan as the credits rolled, as though the room was saying: 'Is that it?'The film looks nice I suppose; and the David and Walter scenes were interesting.This is vprice signing off for a brew.",Null,204,402,12 May 2017
