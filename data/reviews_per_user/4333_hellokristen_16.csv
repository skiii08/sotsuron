"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Enjoyable British Comedy -- but not as zany as you might expect
","Simon Pegg leaves his pregnant bride at the altar and 6 years later is regretting it -- especially when he sees her new rich, handsome, perfect suitor (Hank Azaria's comedic talents wasted in a straight role -- you know he does 100 voices on 'The Simpsons', right?).Simon loves his little boy dearly and fears the new guy might take his place in the boy's heart. So he's going to try to pull himself together before it's too late.There were only 26 people at my noon-on-a-Monday (!) preview screening, but we all were laughing a lot throughout this film. I even found myself wiping away a tear at the moving ending.This film was written by Simon Pegg ('Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz'-- which I loved) and Michael Ian Black (edgy American TV sketch-comedy) and I expected it to be a lot wackier than it was.But maybe they wanted to make something more mainstream to reach a wider audience. Or maybe it was the tempering hand of new movie director David Schwimmer ('Ross' of 'Friends'), who does a good job.A quite enjoyable movie to go see when you want some laughs. A good date movie too, I think.",9,76,111,27 August 2007
Superbad," The First Smart Raunchy Teenboy Movie
","This is a lot more creative than most of the 'high-school-boys-want-to-get laid-before-graduation' genre. The whole audience was laughing all the way through, and the movie kept surprising us.Michael Cera lives up to the promise he showed in 'Arrested Development' as the sweet dork -- you empathize with every excruciatingly awkward moment he experiences.There are lots of cuss words and naughty gestures and drawings -- so if you're easily shocked (or on a first date) this is not the movie for you.There are a pair of cops like you hope don't exist in real life -- but played very amusingly by screenwriter Seth Rogen and SNLer Bill Hader.I'm a bit dubious that boys this nerdy could get girls this hot -- but hey, I guess this is a male fantasy, right? (Someday women writers/ producers will make a movie about plain teen girls getting laid by the cute boys at school. Who call them the next day and ask them to go steady. Girl fantasy!) The ending is a bit ambiguous. There were murmurings in the audience as to what exactly was going on with the Seth character.All in all, a wild and funny and original comedy.",8,5,12,7 August 2007
Cloverfield," Left me Nauseous & Headachey
","I'm deducting 2 stars for how ill this movie made me. Why did NO one warn me that the ENTIRE film was shaky, hand-held video? (I thought it would just be the opening party scene.)'The Blair Witch Project' did the same thing to me. THE X-FILES EXPLANATION: About 40 minutes into every X-Files episode, there was a kind of an explanation for that week's monster. (Something) might have happened to (create/release) this sort of a (monster/disease)!' The same thing happens here 40 minutes in. Pay attention, cuz it's the only sort of explanation you're going to get.(But I have a sneaking suspicion this is the monster that's been stomping around 'Lost' island for the last few years!)I'm left wondering: Why does anyone live in Manhattan anymore? It's always being attacked by gigantic Godzilla-like monsters, Muslim extremists, tsunamis, aliens in spaceships, killer viruses, zombies, Donald Trump...",5,16,33,19 January 2008
Knocked Up," Surprisingly Funny
","From the title I expected an idiot-teen comedy, but it was quite a grown-up comedy. I envision teen boys liking the first 10 minutes (a chubby slacker gets to nail a hot chick after meeting her in a bar), then fleeing when the movie gets into REAL 'adult themes'. Uh-oh. She's pregnant. Now what happens? This movie kept the audience laughing throughout. Most comedies tend to fall apart part-way through, but this one kept the laughs going. It constantly surprises and never settles for the clich√©d joke.There's more sex and nudity in this movie than you usually see in comedies, but it just makes the comedy more real. It's real -- so it's real funny. We've all found ourselves in awkward, yet hilarious, sexual situations like this. (Well, if you're lucky!) All the actors are comedy experts -- many of them from Judd Apatow's other ventures: 'Undeclared' and 'Freaks and Geeks'. Steve Carell, star of Judd's '40 Year Old Virgin' has a cameo. As does Ryan Seacrest who plays himself as a total asshole. (Makes you wonder why he agreed to do this.) Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader from SNL are great in their small roles.Seth Rogan at first glance seems an unlikely leading man. But as the movie goes on, you grow to like him more. We see what the girl comes to see in him: he's funny and supportive and has a loving heart.She's a 10 and he's a 5, so at first you don't think they could make it as a couple, but looks can be deceiving.Paul Rudd and Seth Rogan at Cirque d'Soleil in an altered state is a hilarious scene. (That's how Cirque makes me feel when I see it anyway! Like a bad trip.)",8,181,312,23 March 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Leave a bad taste in your mouth
","This is like 'Saw: The Musical'.Don't get me wrong -- I'm not squeamish. Murder + humor + music = fun for me.I'm a big fan of Sondheim's 'Sweeney Todd' -- have seen 2 professional theatrical productions. Couldn't wait to see this movie.Started to chuckle at 'The Worst Pies in London' (which is a very funny song) -- but the laughter dried up when we were shown close-ups of cockroaches. Lots and lots of cockroaches scampering across Mrs. Lovett's filthy countertop. Too realistic.Dark humor has to be done with a very deft hand. You can't show the murders too clearly. Yet Tim Burton shows us EVERY slit throat, arterial blood pumping and gushing all over the place. Then down the trapdoor it goes and SLAM! lands on its head. He shows this again and again and again....Well, nobody felt like laughing after that.Johnny Depp is gloomy and glowering throughout. Not a good showcase for him. If you love Johnny Depp -- well, go rent a 'Pirates' movie instead.This is a very non-fun and depressing movie. And I think popcorn sales will be down. You don't feel like eating for a long while after.",6,4,18,21 December 2007
Blades of Glory," Amy Poehler & Will Arnett nearly steal the film
","Real-life married couple Amy & Will shine as the villains you love to hate. (They don't actually exhibit 'sexual friction as a brother & sister skating team', as I read somewhere. So relax.) All the supporting comedy performers are great -- however Jon Heder just is not in the same acting league as the rest of them. (I kept thinking: 'Hey, there's Rob Corddry. Now HE'D be great in this part. Or Owen Wilson. Or Jack Black.... Or.....')But I guess they needed a flyweight actor that Will Ferrell could lift over his head. However, Jon does look dazzling in those skating costumes.Will Ferrell does his usual great job, but the material is thin. (Like in his skating costume.) These sure are two homely male leads. I have to wonder: Would two equally funny and average-looking women be given starring roles in a film? I think they'd be told to sit in the back of the bleachers for the crowd scenes.(But enough of my bitter personal experiences in Hollywood!) Oh and Pam from 'The Office' is in the film. Sort of. She seems to be in Jon Heder's comedy acting league.Look closely at the long shots in the skating climax. You can clearly see it is the skating doubles, not Will and Jon.The film is good -- but not great. It seems to be missing something -- like an Act 2. The first half is chock full of laughs, but the second half is not so funny. Good thing the film is pretty short: 1:25.",7,12,40,28 March 2007
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," A Chuckler
","It's a hit-and-miss comedy. There's a few laugh-out-loud moments, but mostly you'll only be chuckling or going 'Was that meant to be funny?'John C. Reilly is not naturally funny and is NOT good to look at in close-up. In one scene a man's naked tackle appears next to his head. I didn't know where to look! EW! (Naked guy was no Dirk Diggler.) I think Judd Apatow is going 'I got away with a closeup of a vagina giving birth in 'Knocked Up'. Time for a closeup of male genitalia!' (And there were lots of drawings of penises in 'Superbad'.) Did you notice that 'Walk the Line' and 'Ray' were practically the same movie? I'm guessing Judd Apatow and Jake Kasden did and set out to write a movie spoofing the formulaic musical biopic. This starts out looking like 'Walk Hard' but then veers into a trip through popular music history -- which is sometimes fun. I enjoyed the Bob Dylan and Glen Campbell phases of Dewey's career.The most delightful scene to me was when they were in India in 1967 with the Maharishi and the Beatles (finishing with a 'Yellow Submarine'-like cartoon). The guys playing the Beatles were hilarious (and dirty -- that's why you only see the briefest snippet in the TV commercials.) Jack Black is Paul and Paul Rudd is John and their bickering is hysterical. Justin Long ('Mac' on the PC vs. Mac commercials) was George and Jason Schwartzman ('Rushmore') is Ringo. This scene was far too brief. If only the whole movie had been this funny. I think they need to get these guys back together and make a whole movie about the Beatles! There are lots of delightful cameos from your favorite comedy actors. The songs seem to be clever, well-written parodies -- I'll have to hear them another way and read the lyrics to fully 'get' them.But it's not as sharp as 'A Mighty Wind' or 'Spinal Tap'.Reilly is a good character actor and a fine singer -- but he is not the guy to carry a comedy. He doesn't have the 'funny bones' of Will Ferrell, Jack Black or Jim Carrey. You start laughing the second those guys appear on screen.It reminded me of 'Blades of Glory' or 'Talladega Nights' -- some wonderful moments, but a lot of dull or mis-fired ones. Gags that are repeated till they become annoying.",7,9,20,12 December 2007
Disturbia," If Nickelodeon remade 'Rear Window'
","It would look just like this.I think they should have given the writers of that film credit and not pretend this was an 'original story'.First 3/4 moves at a verrrry leisurely pace. (A suspense film needs a zippier pace and more shocks.) The bad guy behaves in an unbelievable way towards the end.(Other reviewers said they saw boom mikes in the shots, but I didn't. Maybe they fixed that. Or I just look at the center of the screen at all times.)The kids might enjoy this, but if you want to show them what a GREAT suspense film looks like, rent them 'Rear Window'.(See http://imdb.com/title/tt0047396/) It's sexy and seriously disturbing. (Hitchcock was a bit of a freak.)",6,12,31,3 April 2007
Dreamgirls," Wowee Wowee Wow!
","If you want a good time at the movies, go see Dreamgirls. Feet were tapping, heads were bobbing all throughout. (That's in the audience, I mean.) I saw the original cast on Broadway and as wonderful as that was, the movie version improves on it.(And you can't say that about all movie musicals -- look at 'The Producers'. No, don't.) There are wall to wall songs. Every frame is filled with wonderful things to see and hear.Eddie Murphy and Jennifer Hudson blew me away (and I'm not easily impressed). This is the best role Eddie has ever had. When he first came out as the marcelled 50s soul singer, I had a brief flashback to the 'In the Hot Tub - YOW!' sketch of his early SNL days when he was doing James Brown. But this role goes far beyond mere impersonation. He's a joy to watch every moment.I can see the Academy Voters breathing a collective sigh of relief (from their elderly lungs as they take a hit off their oxygen masks): 'Phfew!! At last! An easy choice for Best Picture Oscar!' Unlike last year: 'Brokeback Mountain or Crash ... hmmm... errrmmm... Do we HAVE to pick one? Can't we just say there were several pretty good pictures this year?' My only quibble is several of the songs sounded Show-Tuney when they ought to have sounded Motown-ey.But I guess they felt they had to reproduce the original score exactly. But they could have made a few improvements there.Also (OK, second quibble) -- occasionally they do that annoying thing that they do in musicals -- where people having a conversation suddenly starting singing to one another. It's fine when the song is being performed on stage by the Supremes -- uh, er, I mean -- 'The Dreams' -- but when brother and sister are talking backstage and suddenly burst into song, well...And (OK, third quibble) they could have used a few moments of black screen after Jennifer Hudson finishes her amazing rendition of 'And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going', coz in the Broadway theater the audience rose to its feet and applauded (the original performer) for 3 minutes. But in the movie they just immediately cut to another scene. We need a moment to take in such an astounding performance.But these are small quibbles and I got past them pretty easily because this whole movie is just so darn enjoyable.",10,1,5,8 December 2006
Ratatouille," Unengaging Story
","If you love snobby French cooking, you'll love this.If you're looking for a fun movie like 'The Incredibles', you'll be disappointed.It's not really a funny movie -- more of an 'Eek!' (will the rat be killed?) and 'Awww' (isn't that heartwarming?) kind of movie.The animation is superb -- but the story is weak.How Remy the Rat controls his human is just dumb. They lost me there. That and when hundreds of rats swarm a house, a kitchen -- I was on the side of the exterminator then.One rat in a kitchen MIGHT be cute. Hundreds are horrible.I loved Patton Oswalt as Remy and Peter O'Toole as the mean food critic. But Janeane Garofalo can barely be understood under her fakey French accent. (Which raises a good point: how come some of these French people have French accents -- but some have English or American? Shouldn't they be consistent?) They were meticulous in creating a French restaurant kitchen, the scenery of Paris and the animation. I only wish they'd put as much effort into the script.",6,14,78,15 June 2007
Bridesmaids," Awful
","And this movie was aimed at me -- I'm a woman and I'm into comedy. I expected to have a good time. I didn't. It just never got funny. A lot of 'almost funny' scenes. A few chuckles. But we deserve better than that.A great cast wasted. The heroine is unlikeable. I don't understand how you write a script for yourself and make yourself unlikeable from every aspect. Her big 'blow-up' scene (intended to be hilarious) just makes you cringe. Shut up and be gracious for your friend, the bride's, sake. Don't make it all about you.The only actor who got good laughs from the audience was Melissa McCarthy ('Mike & Molly'). But her character is another head-scratcher. She seems to be a butch lesbian. Yet lusts after men. So many things just didn't make sense about this movie. And you get distracted thinking 'Why does the Wisconsin highway patrol officer have a British accent?' 'Is that rich lady a bitch or not?' 'Why is that lesbian coming onto that man?' 'Just what is the main character's problem? Is she mentally ill?' None of this is helpful to a comedy.",3,15,31,13 May 2011
Shrek the Third," Many Delightful Moments
","There are many fun and laugh-out-loud moments in the film. However the story isn't as good as the previous two.For one thing, Shrek and Fiona spend most of the film apart -- and their love story is the heart of the Shrek saga.The subplot about villains banding together and taking over the kingdom was already done last year in 'Happily N'Ever After'. They even used many of the same fairy tale villains. Hmmmm...Sadly, John Cleese has only a brief scene, but his Monty Python buddy Eric Idle steps in and does a good job as Merlin. Justin Timberlake is fine as Arthur, the teen who would be king.The Donkey/Dragon babies are adorable. Be sure to stay for the fun closing credits. They'll send you out singing and dancing.",7,4,8,17 May 2007
Transformers," Pssst! If you're a woman -- read this!
","The guys in the audience at my screening were practically ejaculating in their seats. This was VERY exciting for them. For me (middle-aged woman), eh. Not so much.(Look at all those 10 star reviews on here. They're all written by these guys.)See there's this 17 year old boy who has a crush on a girl in his class. Who appears to be 30 and a supermodel. When she finds out he's got a car that's an alien robot, she's all over him. (Yes, it's all about boy fantasies.) Keep your little kids (or anyone nightmare-prone) FAR away from this film! A LOT of nightmarish images. Nice people and little kids have very scary pointy metallic objects reaching for them. Or batting them around. (I'm pretty sure a lot of people were killed -- but they glossed over that quickly.) Even tho I'd never seen a Transformer cartoon or toy or whatever the frick these things are, I was able to grasp the plot easily. But the movie just wore me down.These huge piles of garbage (or whatever the frick they are) were hard to wrap my eyes around. When they stood up and moved they were impressive (frightening even). But when they spoke, they just seemed dorky.The movie whip-sawed between goofy comedy and terrifying action movie. Seems to be a mish-mash of styles. It didn't have an even tone. (And yes, I understand about comic relief.) The movie just seemed cobbled together from a lot of different parts -- like the creatures.Around 3/4 of the way thru, I got tired of big things whamming each other and shut my eyes for a few moments. Open my eyes: Still going on. And on and on.I couldn't wait for it to be over. At the end of the movie I was headachy and slightly nauseous.But the guys were jumping in the air. Outside they were peeling out in their over-sized trucks way too fast. ('Look at me! I'm a Transformer!')Ah. Boys and their toys.If you're a male in real or prolonged adolescence this will probably be the high point of your life.But if you're anyone else, I suggest you find something else in the cineplex to see and let the boys have this one all to themselves.",6,18,41,28 June 2007
Dark Shadows," Moribund
","Definition of Moribund: 'In terminal decline; lacking vitality or vigor.' That's this movie. Don't believe the trailers -- they made it look very witty and fast-paced. Instead it is slow and dull. Why don't they get the people who make the trailers to make the movie? Trailers are always fast-paced and funny and make the movies look terrific. I think there are jokes in the trailers that are not IN this movie! Why would you remove jokes from a movie that has too few?Johnny Depp tries his hardest, as he always does. But the script is just flat. Sad to see that Tim Burton has demoted his girlfriend, Helena Bonham Carter, to 'older character lady' role. Women in their 20s get the romantic leads. (Is Johnny not aging?)Also story steals a bit from Twilight. So we've seen it all before.",3,24,53,11 May 2012
Music and Lyrics," Bubbly, charming and funny
","This describes the movie, Hugh and Drew. If there's anybody more adorable and lovable than Hugh Grant, it's Drew Barrymore.It opens with a hilarious 1984 music video starring Hugh and his old bandmates. Oh, that will bring back memories of the groups we drooled over in 80s.I know people will say this is just a chick flick, but the men in the theater were chuckling right along. Hugh's character is very witty all the way through.Refreshingly, even though Hugh's character is a has-been (and his former bandmate is still famous and now knighted), he is not at all bitter. He is perfectly happy with his life singing at fairs and amusement parks and 1987 class reunions.It's not a great romantic comedy, but it's a very pleasant way to spend 96 minutes and I came out of the theater in a good mood which lasted the rest of the day.",8,1,2,17 February 2007
Beowulf," Warning: IMAX 3-D made me nauseous
","However, I loved the movie and the 3-D was 85% of what was enjoyable. I think a 'flat' version would be flat. Most of the excitement comes with the 3-D images coming at ya. I had to keep from reaching my hand up to touch the bubbles (or whatever) seemed to be floating in the air right in front of me.After about 20 minute, I started to feel ooky, so took off my glasses and closed my eyes for a few minutes. Had to repeat this several times. But I'm proud to say I made it thru the 1:55 movie length without barfing. It's now 2 hours since I left the theater and I'm still slightly nauseous.However, other people weren't bothered. SO maybe it's just me -- or where I was sitting (last row, far right seat). I think you have to find out exactly where your head needs to be so you don't see double images -- then pin your head to the back of your seat and DON'T MOVE IT!Another warning: it's pushing the limits for a PG-13 movie. For the timid or very young, it might be too much. Lots of limb-ripping, head-chomping, torso-goring and nudity. Several children in our theater were crying. (At the sight of Angelina Jolie's 3-D boobies, perhaps!)",8,6,17,14 November 2007
