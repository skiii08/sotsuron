Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Mess, But A Spectacular One
","Next to the special editions, the Star Wars prequels are perhaps the most hated part of the saga. In a way, it makes sense as to why. Each of the three films, released between 1999 and 2005, are filled with their share of issues, ranging from corny dialogue, stilted acting, over-reliance on CGI, and inconsistencies and plot holes when compared to the original trilogy. Many people hate the Star Wars prequels, but I must say that I am not one of them. In fact, I enjoy the prequels for what they are, and even though they aren't perfect, they still work in the overall story of the series as a whole.Having said that, it's no secret that The Phantom Menace, the first Star Wars film in the prequel trilogy and the start of the story chronologically, is a mess of a movie. From a story standpoint, it tries very hard to incorporate so much, jumping from one planet to another, having so many different characters and plot threads all going on at once. Granted, I understand why: this film not only has to be the start to a trilogy, but also the series as a whole. However, it's clear that after not directing or writing a film since the 1970s, George Lucas struggled to get the story together in a consistent and fluent way.This does not mean, however, that The Phantom Menace is without its positive moments. The visual effects still look pretty incredible almost twenty years later. The action sequences are exciting and the lightsaber battles, particularly the final three-way battle between Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon, and Darth Maul, are well choreographed. They definitely make the movie watchable throughout the 130 minute runtime. However, the weak script is really what bogs this story down. The dialogue is atrocious in this movie, and there are so many lines that are achingly bad. Even the acting can be pretty stilted at time, delivered as if they are reading their lines from a cue card.That said, there are some decent performances in the film as well. Liam Neeson gives a spectacular performance as Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi- Wan's master. He was able to keep my attention anytime he was on screen, and was able to get through most of the film's dialogue without any problems. Ewan McGregor also shines as young Obi-Wan. Though he has a line or two that is pretty corny, he does a fine job in the role and continues to get better as the movies go along. Ian McDairmid reprises his role as Palpatine, a senator in this movie, and works very well in his brief but important role in the story.Sadly, many of the other performances and/or characters aren't as good. I know it has been said many times, but Jar Jar Binks is an annoying character. When I first saw this movie, I didn't mind him as much, but in recent years I've come to understand why there is so much hate towards him. He's a bumbling idiot that almost adds nothing to the story except in the final battle. And as much I hate to put Jake Lloyd down as he was only a kid when the film came out, he wasn't that great as little Anakin Skywalker. I know it sounds like I'm bagging on this movie for its flaws, but that is only because they truly hinder what could be a great film. The concept behind the prequels and their overall story is not bad; in fact, this movie does what it was setting out to do: create a beginning for the series that would set up not only what happens in the rest of the trilogy but in the entire saga as a whole. It just didn't do it as well as it could have. That being said, the reason why I don't give it any lower than a 6/10 is because I can still watch this movie, flaws and all, and still get enjoyment out of it. I still love the visual effects. I still love the action sequences. I still think that it has a lot of great moments sprinkled throughout the film. That is why I don't think that this is a bad film, but rather a film that is both spectacular and messy all at the same time.",6,1,1,1 June 2017
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A Better Sequel, But Still Flawed
","After the disappointment of The Phantom Menace, many people hoped that Attack of the Clones, the second installment of George Lucas' Star Wars Prequel Trilogy, would fine tune some of the issues that plagued the first film. In same ways they got that, in others not so much. While the film improved its storytelling ability and lessened the amount of Jar Jar on screen, fans still moaned over the script's corny dialogue and poorly written romance. And in a way, I'm right there with them, though I think I give this movie a little more credit that others do.First of all, I agree that the story here is much better. While there are still some areas that don't fit very well nor are answered entirely (Master Sifo Dyas, anyone?), I felt that it moved smoother than Phantom Menace's did. It didn't feel like we were jumping from place to place and had less characters and plot threads to worry about. Here we have only two main story lines: the investigation into the clone army with Obi-Wan Kenobi and the romance plot involving Anakin and Padme.The storyline involving Obi-Wan's discovery of the clone army is perhaps the movie's most intriguing plot line. It keeps the viewer's attention (or at least it did mine) and definitely invested us into the mystery of the clone army's origins. Granted, some areas of it were not properly explained (once again, Sifo Dyas, anyone?), but it is at the very least engaging. The romantic subplot also does keep one interested, as well as when it leads to Anakin returning to Tatooine in order to find his mother. However, there's one issue that bogs this part down: the terrible romance writing.This film focuses heavily on the relationship between Anakin and Padme and how they become lovers, despite the fact that Jedi are not allowed to love. And even though I was still engaged in what was going on, there was a lot of it that didn't work. It felt forced at times and it didn't always make sense as to why Padme loved Anakin, especially considering how dark things get with him before the end of the story, foreshadowing his turn the dark side. And of course there is also the dialogue, which is very cheesy during these scenes (and throughout the rest of the film as well).The visual effects are, once again, very impressive, but I've noticed that there are a lot of moments that look fairly dated. There are moments of people walking in different areas and you can tell it is full green-screen. Almost all of the clone troopers in this movie are CGI and you start to notice it more and more as time goes by. Still, most of the visual effects still look good to this day.While there isn't a ton of action in Episode II, when it is there is it entertaining. The final battle especially is pretty fantastic all the way down to the final lightsaber battle. I know many people are split on the lightsaber fight between Yoda and Count Dooku, but I enjoyed it a lot, and despite people arguing that it goes against his character (which it doesn't; he is a jedi so he would use a lightsaber), I think it works for the film. I will say that there were some aspects of the lightsaber battle that happened before this moment that I didn't like. I feel like George Lucas tried to fix the whole 'the lightsaber fights are too choreographed!' complaint some fans had by slowing it down, and is honestly doesn't work very well. Granted it's not in the scene much, but it is definitely noticeable.Overall, Attack of the Clones is a better movie than The Phantom Menace. However, it still contains some of the same issues that plagued that movie. The writing is still not the best here and really shows in romance section of the story. The CGI isn't quite as convincing, and there are parts of the story that aren't explained very well. However, that being said, I was more invested in this one than I was with the previous outing and I overall I think it is better than the first film, if not only by a little bit.",7,0,1,1 June 2017
