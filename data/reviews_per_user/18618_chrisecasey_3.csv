Blade Runner 2049," Gosling spares no prisoners and then follows a lead re his origins
","Taken at face value, this showcase of Gosling's acting might be construed as strange, to say the least. But he really can scream like a Banshee. Say Ryan, if you're reading this would you consider the role of Jason Numbers in my novel Crazy Train that just has to be made into a movie, just has to. Numbers is a real estate agent by day, a cold blooded henchman, named the Banshee at night. And true to his name, he does scream like a Banshee before putting the dinner knife into probation officer, Tank Holdern's side at Vanessa Carlton's sweet seventeen party. Say, Blade Runner has a similar scene, Ryan's char getting a knife to the side. Maybe great minds do think alike... So, the wounds from the cyborg-like assassin's non-dinner knife - in fact, its a switch blade - are what kills Ryan's char. I don't mind spoiling other people's story's, not my own however. Ha, ha, ha. But this guy's life hasn't been a total dud, he sees a hologram of Elvis Presley singing one of his many spirituals - talk about a bucket list. What is it about Presley that makes people believe he's just another guy who could sing rockabilly. I'm of the opine that, like most artists he never felt he quite belonged, and his ballads are pretty good because of it. To it's credit, Blade Runner dialogue is exquisite in places, taking English to a level only Shakespeare could have devised. The villain couldn't be more cold-hearted and downright scary. I wished that the story had ended with the villain's death, not the Blade Runner's. Don't ask me why, the writer wanted it to end this way. Some people hate their jobs, I guess. For that reason, I wouldn't recommend seeing this installment. Except for the dialogue in places, a cool twist on who the Blade Runner could have possibly been, and a very well done sex scene with the computer in a real woman - what the heck, see the darn thing for those three reasons.",3,10,20,10 October 2017
Baby Driver," Kid with lots of potential has accident and goes into business as a getaway driver
","Baby is his name. But the real hook is how Spacey's iconic ringleader character can present Baby to other losers in the gang as a flawed yet brilliant individual. His flaw, the 'Hum in the drum,' 'makes him the best,' line is delivered with perfection, and I had to sit on my hands to keep from applauding it. So, you might guess that the flaw becomes a gimmick. Baby's music provides the background sound track to the movie, and it's excellent. Motown gets much representation. The Damned, a band I once tried to copy, is also there. So, watch it just for the music. The nuances are what makes this pretty good. Fifties style diner, fifties style dream sequence, and the beginning of a love affair that will carry Baby through to the end of the movie has us believe that America is about working class values, even if they are slinging hash, and scoring 'easy money.' That last part, the scoring money, makes this a real seventies and eighties style story, recall shows like 'It Takes a Thief,' movies like 'Thunderbolt and Lightfoot,' and 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.' Well, for Baby Driver's similarities to those nightmares, I change my recommendation, anti-hero's are just plain passe, even if they dream of their girlfriends as bobby soxers next to gleaming yellow land yachts. There are better movies to see.",3,4,8,11 October 2017
Wonder Woman," Nazi like villains during WW1?
","I heard that WWI is an underrepresented war, at least compared to WWII, that only a few good movies were made for that first conflict on the old continent. This is not one of the better WWI movies, but it has some value, I mean boy toy Gal Gadot couldn't have been a better choice, and Chris Pine maintains a straight face during the facts of life lecture to Gal Gadot who only experienced femininity, as it were. I was driven to distraction by edits from the evil lab tech creating a poisonous gas and the touristy dynamic of misfit Wonder Woman and her soft-boiled escort. Needless to say, I left early. I think it was around the time that the fish out of water routine got boring. For example, Pine's character remained surprised by the female warrior routine, and Gadot stayed unabashed in the cultural millieu of gender stuff in that era. I can't remember exactly, but I think there was a scene of too much alcohol - so tacky - that Leaving was the only right response. Thanks, miss it.",2,7,16,24 October 2017
