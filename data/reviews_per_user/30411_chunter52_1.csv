Mission: Impossible III," the problemo
","the line 'democracy wins' sure took me out of the film and back into current events. it made me hypercritical of the whole movie. in retrospect, the film took the watered down attempt at a curve ball who done it and mixed it with the super deadly disease from MI1 and MI2 respectively.the first movie still posed the most 'impossible mission' and had the easily the best writing. i had always hoped and assumed that any Mission:Impossible sequels would be done with new and talented cast. the cast could change each film which would fill each movie with a new group of characters we could learn to like or hate.the characters could remain interchangeable with presumably Ethan being the leader - but not the star-. this may seem out there but i think it would have proved more entertaining and definitely more original. being a fan of the old series(in syndication) i always thought the movies would have worked better that way. i still enjoyed it though. not a bad movie at all, great action sequences and killer acting on Phillip Seymours part; i mean that dude was mean. the movie was pretty cool and worth the price of admission, just mildly unoriginal.",6,0,1,9 May 2006
