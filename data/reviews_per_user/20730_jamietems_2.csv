The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," THE HUNGER GAMES IS BACK AND BETTER THEN EVER! though some people disagree on the films tone
","THE HUNGER GAMESMOCKINGJAYPART 1why? people really don't like this film i'll tell you why. people didn't like the mockingjay films, because of the lack of action katniss being less powerful then in the first 2 and a lot of propaganda BUT mockingjay is a war film and would have things to do with torture, PTSD and propaganda that is what the main theme of the mockingjay films are about. anyway, i'll tell you my opinion. its gritty tone and music suits the film perfectly 10/10
The Propoganda and war feel we get when watching the film is perfectly done, intense and hard to watch, but at the same time great. and the uprising of the Districts. 10/10it's direction great! Francis Lawrence is an amazing director and always will be, it's gritty tone really sits with you throughout the entire movie.the acting in the film is also really strong just like catching fire and hunger games I really mean it, it is some of the best acting I've seen and the films have some of the best actors I've also seen in other films!Overall, I love the film because it tells a very realistic story with great visuals, great acting, great cinematography, superb music and fantastic directing i give this film a 10/10 its very realistic and gritty and violent.Just as a warning I felt physically sick during the film, mainly because of how harrowing it was.Now taking all things into consideration, I suggest that you should watch this film, simply because of how great it is. It's my favourite of THE HUNGER GAMES films, and I will definitely be watching them again! :D",10,0,2,28 May 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars: VII Review 10/10
","Okay let me just say, that this is one of the best goddammed movies of all time, Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens changed my life and inspired me to create and write my own short films, and i thank J.J Abrams for creating one of the most innocent and exciting movies of all time.30 years have passed and Luke Sywalker has dissappered and the FIRST ORDER has risen with the help of a ragtag group of heroes, and general Leia Organa's RESISTANCE, they set out to find Old Legend himself, also with the help from Han Solo and chewbacca the wookie, the acting was better than oscar worthy! They casted these characters so well and so accurately.I don't mostly get the hate for this film, its so good! so what if there's a black man in the movie, so what if the main character is a woman? and plus, the reason that Rey Beat Kylo during the forest fight, because he's beating himself and he's bleeding, and plus he's emotionally unstable after he litterally just killed Han Solo his own father.",10,9,48,15 December 2018
