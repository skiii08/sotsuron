The Ring," Good movie but...
","This movie was pretty good and I DID jump out of my seat a couple of times, making my wife on one side and her Mom on the other jump up with me heheheh However one thing bugged us... a whole lot! Midway through the movie, like right about the scene where the horse jumped off the boat, we could see a bunch of microphones following all the actors around, especially Rachel, her ex, the kid, and Mr Morgan!!! Bad editing or what? Was it just us in Maryville who saw this blunder for like 20 minutes of reel time or were there others?",Null,0,0,19 October 2002
