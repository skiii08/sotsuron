50 First Dates," i'll be back tomorrow
","this is a fun movie. the chemistry between sandler and barrymore makes the film so interesting. she has a brain disorder that makes her forget everything that happened the day before whenever she falls asleep and their love story begun with this major problem . the film is a sweet romance comedy very well acted. i view it two times and i think this is a very good comedy. if you want an easy and relaxing film, you should watch it. this is also good for a date movie. the plot and the laughters will surely have a positive impact on the partner. Rob Schneider and Sean Astin are very funny and will draw some laughters. The Hawaiian location is splendid. go see it",6,1,2,12 November 2007
