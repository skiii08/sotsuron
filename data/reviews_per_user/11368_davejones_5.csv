The Finest Hours," The moments of high suspense work, troughs between the waves not so much
","The main story worked well. The action scenes and effects were great. I found it quite suspenseful.The attempts to wring every last bit of emotion out of the quieter character moments were sometimes forced and made me want to shout at the screen, 'So get on with it!'--Like the moment when all the freighter crew are aboard the rescue vessel and Casey Afleck is asking Chris Pine if he knows the way back to shore and Pine's explaining to him, 'Well the wind was coming from my left on the way out, so I figure if I keep it to my right I'll be heading back in and if we just look out for some lights. . . ' Which seems like a reasonable enough plan. However, in the meantime, some of these men have actually fallen overboard and must be dying of hypothermia but Captain Pine stands there brooding over the helm with the boat's motor idling, discussing his plan instead of JUST GETTING ON WITH IT. You can talk and drive at the same time, right Chris . . ? Same with a lot of scenes with fishermen huddled over coffee mugs telling us how dangerous it is to be out there on the water on a night like this instead of just getting the camera out there and showing it (which eventually the movie does; it just takes its sweet time about it).SPOILER ALERT: So, was anyone else bothered by the fact that, as the rescued freighter crew climbs, one by one, off the rescue boat and onto the dock that they all (with the exception of Pine) appear to be BONE DRY? I mean, some of these crewmen were actually overboard, floundering in the ocean, just a half an hour earlier. And it's been snowing ever since.So how did they dry off in an open boat? An open boat that, by the way, appears to have the abilities of a submarine in a few scenes. How does an internal-combustion engine run underwater like that? Without air?Could've used one of those on the freighter.",6,3,6,12 February 2016
Billy Elliot," Boy overcomes coal-mining Dad's objections to become a dancer
","Okay, let's just take it as a given that the premise of this movie is more than a little familiar: A young boy must overcome his coal mining father's misgivings about ballet to get into the British Royal Academy of Ballet or whatever it's called.  (Have you ever seen the Monty Python sketch about the son who comes home and announces to his actor father that he wants to be a coal miner?  This plot was a cliche thirty years ago!) I guess I can forgive a movie for starting with a weak premise.But hasn't anyone noticed how paper thin and poorly developed the story is once we proceed from that shopworn premise?  I mean, where's the actual struggle to learn how to dance? Isn't THAT the most difficult part of becoming a professional ballet dancer?  We get about one, one-minute scene in which Billy Elliot tries to do a pirouette, falls down and says `I can't do it!'  to which his tough-but-lovable instructor says, 'Yes you can! Again!' And that's really the extent of his struggle to LEARN how to dance.Now I know what you're thinking: `Ah, but the real struggle is against the tyranny of the stereotype that all male dancers are gay!'  But that doesn't seem to be much of a problem for Billy either.  I mean, his father and brother have to be weaned from this stereotype, but everyone else in town is giving him the thumbs up and cheering him on from the moment Billy decides he wants to be a dancer.This movie is beautifully shot, scored, and acted, but none of this can make up for such a weak script.  I guess that for people who've never seen one of these artist-struggles-mightily-against-his circumstances-to-become-a-star movies it seems like some kind of revelation, but to me it just seemed like a very poorly developed, connect-the-dots story.It had a few effective moments, (I liked particularly the scene in which the older brother sees his father on the scab express and goes running after him)  But, from what I can recall, all of the other effective scenes in this movie concern the miner's strike subplot, and not the main Billy Elliot line.  The main plot of this movie is barely present.",Null,0,1,12 August 2001
Silver Linings Playbook," A movie that knows just when to break the rules
","The problem I have with romantic comedies is that they are the most formulaic and hidebound of all the genres. If it's a comedy, then by definition it has to have a happy ending. And if it's a romance, the only happy ending is to have the two leads get together. So usually I'm just tapping my toe, waiting for the leads to get through the requisite squirming before the inevitable.Lately, we've seen a variety of crude gags thrown into the mix, presumably to distract us from this inevitability This movie does a great job of hewing closely enough to the standard romcom formula to keep an audience satisfied, while undercutting it enough to surprise us now and then and prevent us from seeing exactly where it's going at any point. The outcome of the big dance contest is a perfect example.It's not easy to write a movie that's this particular, this original and yet satisfying. Wonderful performances don't hurt, either.Warning: There are a few unbelievably long scenes. And yet they work.",9,3,10,22 November 2012
Limitless," A Fun and Original Science-fiction Thriller
","This movie doesn't exactly go deep with either the moral or thematic implications of super intelligence. Nor are the characters particularly well developed. But I was engaged from beginning to end with this taut and, best of all, original thriller. I've never seen anything quite like it. It proceeds in a generally credible and suspenseful way from its premise--a pill that allows you to use all of your brain.Of course, the notion that we're only using a small fraction of our brains is untrue, but I liked how the film uses this urban fib as a springboard for its engaging story.There are one or two moments that strain credulity, (I'm thinking, particularly, of the one-eyed thug who can't seem to hit the broad side of a barn with his gun) but I think every good story has a few of those.The camera tricks and visual effects used to externalize what's going on in the main character's head are also a lot of fun. Good performances by all the actors.If you yearn for science fiction movies and thrillers that you can actually believe from moment to moment and haven't seen 10 times before, then I'd recommend this one.",8,228,294,14 March 2011
Looper," I wish the writer had finished the movie he started
","Don't get me wrong; this movie is very well made. It was well acted, shot and directed. I was never bored.But I started out watching a movie about a hit man who shoots mob victims sent back in time from the future, and knows that his final victim will be his older self. Interesting idea--even if it's not very plausible. But okay, let's just run with it. That's the movie I saw in the trailers, the one I expected to see.So, when his future self comes back, present-day self hesitates for a moment and future self gets the drop on him and runs off. Now present-day self must hunt down and kill future self. Also interesting.SPOILER FOLLOWSBut then, it's all about a telekinetic farm kid who will one day rule the world with an iron fist. . . er, brain. . . if he isn't stopped.Huh. . . ? Where the hell did that come from? I know, I know, it's foreshadowed by showing us that 10% of the population has trivial telekinetic powers. They can make coins float above their hands.But to me, this film starts one story and then switches in mid-stream to a story stemming from a second, unrelated science fiction premise.While it was refreshing that the movie didn't just turn into a series of action sequences in which JGL tries to kill BW (which would have been a pretty one-sided conflict, admittedly) I found this shift in emphasis to be far more distracting than Joseph Gordon-Levitt's prosthetic nose. Which I never had a problem with.Anyway, I appear to be the only one bothered by this so just go ahead and enjoy the movie.",7,664,907,29 September 2012
