Casablanca," Casablanca (1942)
","The lighting and photography in Casablanca (1942) was phenomenal.In the beginning when we are shown the streets of Casablanca, the shot contains so much activity and movement it appeals visually to the viewer almost immediately. The same can be said when we first are shown Rick's club, the amount of contrast and so many things moving at once (and bright) in one shot. There is a scene when the police chief is talking to Rick while Rick is out of the shot. Rick's shadow is seen clearly against the wall and it appears as if the chief is talking directly to Rick's shadow. A good visual effect. In the scene when Rick is drinking and sulking in the middle of the night, the lighting (or lack of) and shadows totally set the depressing mood for that scene. The protagonists are mostly seen wearing brighter/lighter colored clothing. I like that the social message of the film was one of anti-Nazisentiment, especially because at the time of the film's release the war had not been won yet. The dialog was witty and fast paced. Very good film.",9,0,1,12 April 2011
Taxi Driver," Taxi Driver (1976)
","I feel that Taxi Driver(1976) is somewhat overrated. I feel that it was very slow moving for the most part. It was hard to interpret the intentions of the protagonist throughout the majority of the movie. I kept feeling like something violent was about to happen, despite the relaxing jazz music. I was confused when Travis took his date to the porn theater, I didn't understand why he would at all think that a good idea. I feel that this film definitely stands out among other Martin Scorsese films in the way that the main character is developed; I feel that even though he was the protagonist, he wasn't a well-rounded character. As if I were watching a stranger the entire time, it was hard for me to feel any sort of connection to Travis.",6,0,2,13 May 2011
The Grapes of Wrath," The Grapes of Wrath (1940)
","The Grapes of Wrath (1940) was a very well-made look at the experience of an Oklahoma farmer during the Dust Bowl of the 1930's. It is hard not to feel sympathy for the families who are losing their homes and farms. It was an intensely emotional scene when Muley and his family have to watch their homes be plowed to the ground. There were some scenes that it was easy to tell that there was a painted backdrop ( for example when Tom is arriving back home for the first time, he is walking through a field and there's an obvious backdrop.)The fact that the director was able to create a convincing look at the dustbowl so soon after it occurred definitely speaks for his talent.",7,0,0,12 May 2011
Annie Hall," Annie Hall (1977)
","Annie Hall was funny and very cleverly written. The film doesn't feature very much music, and the editing is unique in the way it skips around through the characters many topics of conversation, as well as the way Woody Allen is constantly breaking the fourth wall. The humor was really 'dry', which I like. I just feel that Woody Allen's character was (although funny) a little depressing. It was funny to hear the point of views he had,and the way he delivered those views was good. I just can't say i completely agree with him. In some instances I feel he was much too critical of a character, and seemed insecure with himself. Overall it was an enjoyable film with laugh out loud comedy.",7,0,0,13 May 2011
The Graduate," The Graduate (1967)
","The Graduate (1967) was an alright film. The first half was entertaining; watching the awkward Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman) stumble over himself as he carries on an affair with the attractive Mrs. Robinson. But then it took a sort of dark turn when Ben starts to fall in love with Mrs. Robinson's daughter. What started out as a quirky comedy ended up turning into depressing, quasi-romantic story. I feel as if Ben's relationship with Elaine wasn't truly genuine, almost as if he only liked her because Mrs. Robinson told him not too. And when he breaks up Elaine's wedding and they both escape together on the bus, they both look as if there was some regret in their facial expressions. All in all it was good. It features explicit sex and nudity, which during the time of the film's release was considered taboo to be seen in films. All in all it was a good movie.",6,1,2,12 May 2011
Singin' in the Rain," Singin' in the Rain (1952)
","I enjoyed all the great dancing and acrobatics in Singin' in the Rain (1952). The dancing almost reminded me of an older version of break dancing. Especially in the 'Make 'em Laugh' song when Cosmo runs up the wall, as well as other crazy stunts. The female dancing resembled that of the flapper styles from a few decades before the movie was made. The film was comedic and clever, with a balanced mix of impressive music and dance. When the song 'Beautiful Girls' was performed, it reminded me of Buzby Berkely style of filming, with all the colors and patterns of the female background dancers. When Don performs 'Singin' in the Rain', the camera motion is very fluid, and transitions itself around the dancing actor smoothly and unnoticeable. I'm not the biggest fan of musicals, but this film is definitely a classic.",7,1,2,19 April 2011
