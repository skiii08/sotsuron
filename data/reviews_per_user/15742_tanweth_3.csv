Sucker Punch," Heavy Metal meets Live Action
",This movie was very reminiscent of the old Heavy Metal animated movie. Sexy .. powerful music (hated the rap bit though) .. flight of fantasy going two levels deep. By using techniques developed originally by the Wachowski brothers (Matrix) .. and even further developed today .. lend a fantastic visual journey not seen elsewhere.In essence .. it was like Heavy Metal brought to live action with amazing Matrix like effects and seamless CGI.The lengthy start was almost enough for me to turn it off. But once the fantasy within a fantasy began .. I was captivated. The irony of the ending should not escape anyone. And happily .. justice did prevail .. although belatedly .. and not for all.,8,2,4,13 July 2011
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," By far the worst of the Harry Potter movies
","Yes, the acting was excellent. Casting of Umbridge was excellent. The special fx likewise excellent.But acting, casting and fx do not make a movie.This movie can not stand alone and be enjoyed. If you haven't read the book(s), then the movie will make very little sense to you. It's disjointed, choppy, with little or no continuity, and simply doesn't make much sense.For instance, the opening scene with Harry and Dudley was about the longest scene in the entire movie. Yet, there was nearly no follow up later in the movie as to how and why it happened.The capture of the DA members made no sense either, unless you hadn't read the book. Then the means of entry into the Room of Requirement used in the movie is OK.Or the veil in the ministry. What was that about? (You want to know, go read the book.) The betrayal of the DA breaks the continuity between Harry and Cho from previous stories and future references & possibilities.Then, of course, what was the purpose of the DA in the first place? Wasn't it due to the OWLS? So was the DA successful or was it a failure? The last scene with the DA and Umbridge seems to say it was a failure.Okay, so the biggest book of all is crammed into a short movie barely long enough to give the Reader's Digest version. Even so, the liberties taken in the movie, the choppy nature of the movie and the lack of continuity leaves this viewer cold.I read somewhere that this director was going to be making the next movie as well. If he does, I will certainly wait until I find out if he botched the job again before rushing out and seeing the movie.",2,1,1,23 December 2007
In Time," Drags on for 12 hrs .. oh wait .. it was less than 2 hrs
",An interesting twist to Logan's Run and turns into a sci-fi version of Robin Hood and Maid Marian while attempting to wreck the world's economy. Rather than an automatic death sentence at the end of your time ala Logan's Run .. time can be bartered giving some very long lives. But the idea that the way things work .. upping the cost of things .. raising interest rates .. to keep the population in check .. that's the secret? I guess these people are really really stupid not to be able to figure that out without being told.The story development seems to take way too much time and there was no feeling of suspense until about the last 20 minutes or so.The ending was predictable with only a couple of choices to be had. Kinda like painting yourself into a corner with little room to wiggle or twist out of it.The idea of time becoming the future currency of commerce seems like a logical step. As does the idea of keeping the number of people alive at a manageable level .. although there would be better ways in which to keep the population explosion at a minimum rather than killing them off when they ran out of 'money'. Money equating to time in this case.I would think that an idea of both reversible and permanent sterilization procedures would be a far better solution to maintain the population. But then these folks are probably too stupid to have thought of that. Just like they couldn't figure out that with everyone basically being immortal would cause a population explosion the likes of which everyone would die within a few years due to simple starvation.Actually .. at the time it became possible to become immortal at age 25 .. but you might die if you ran out of time .. I am sure there would be an insurrection to end all insurrections the moment this plan as outlined in this movie were put into place. And what about being able to counterfeit the time? I mean .. it's simply a tech device implanted in you right? So there would also be 'hackers' into the tech device. So in the final analysis .. dumb idea .. dumber people.,4,1,4,29 December 2011
