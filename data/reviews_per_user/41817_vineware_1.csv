Ali," All in all positive
","Will Smith's performance was excellent and, although there was no character development other than Ali and to a lesser degree Bundini Brown, the movie was entertaining and worth seeing.  Will Smith's physical transformation and his capture of Ali's speech patterns was truly outstanding.",7,0,0,8 January 2002
