The Ring," Just an 'americanized remake' really less good than the original
","The Ring is just a bad 'mainstream' remake of the japan original movie : Ringu probably on of the best horror movie i ever see. In the original version, i was feeling really deeply scared looking the movie. I was this movie feeling connected too with japan traditional background of the movie. Compared to the original the Americanized version have no taste. The cultural transposition did not really work (probably even more outside America). Probably it's a good movie compared to gore and B rated movies. But it is just a bad copy. Just one advice for people who like it : Go to see Ringu -> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0178868/",3,1,3,28 November 2006
