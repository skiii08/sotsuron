The Blair Witch Project," PANTS!!!
","Don't believe the hype! If you want to watch something scary, try Barney. This film should never be given the mantle 'scariest film of all time', that title should belong to either The Exorcist or The Shining. This film is not in the slightest bit scary even if you do use your imagination, and believe me I tried!",1,2,4,8 December 1999
