The Blair Witch Project," The cinematic equivalent of real-life dental torture...
","Three vacuous pothead filmmakers get lost in the woods while filming a documentary about some long-dead, insane old broad who was apparently a witch, or something. Unfortunately, they never really elaborated so you're understanding of the antagonist ends by the time they walk into the woods like three giant, stoned turkeys. I guess we just get to make up the rest, ourselves. Use your imagination, folks.Anyway, they then get lost in the woods (boy, what a surprise) due to the fact that, in their boundless wisdom, they decide that it would be a good idea to trust in the acuity of the derpiest of all three of them (Heather) to perform land navigation for them, while having absolutely no understanding of land navigation, themselves, with one of them literally describing the map as being 'Greek' to him.They wander around the woods for days with predictably spooky things happening to them that could, I guess, kinda, in some way, vaguely resemble things involving witchcraft (like I said; use your imagination) that escalates with every night that goes by. Apart from that we're treated to a farting-in-the-tent joke, a lot of yelling and arguing, an excessive, insipid and obnoxious use of profanity, and a lot completely uneventful meandering around the woods.There is a light at the end of the tunnel, however; they all die. You don't get to see what happens, but it can be assumed that their fearless leader gets cracked over the head with a blunt object. I found it ironic because, at that very moment, I was imagining myself creeping up behind her and doing the exact same thing just to stop her incessant screaming and whining. It wouldn't have been surprising if it turned out that the witch, or old woman, or 'crazy redneck,' or Clinton voter, or, you know... whatever... had decided to kill her for the same reason.So, where am I going with all of this? Well, it's simple. There's really nothing special or even entertaining about this film, so I recommend that you don't watch it. Also, never cook pork bacon naked.",1,2,5,1 February 2017
Monster," Monster: A Misandric Fabrication (Possible Spoilers)
","I just finished watching this film and, I must say, I am in a mixed state of both disgust and awe.First off, let's get down to the brass tacks on something: Aileen Carol Wuornos was a vicious, psychopathic misanthrope who murdered without remorse or regret to satisfy her lust for the blood of her fellow man and her intemperate greed. She was pure evil; plain and simple. That being said, this film is the worst kind of tripe; a story full of deliberate misandric falsification to lend sympathy to a barbaric serial murderer, with the star (Theron) admitting to the lack of factual representation.Not only am I insulted by the creators of this filth having wasted my time, but I am also disgusted with the lack of regard to the real victims' loved ones, and in awe of how degraded society has become; that there are people who would actually go as far as to make a movie like this.If you have not yet seen this movie, I suggest you pass it up.",1,3,13,13 January 2017
American Beauty," Try as I might...
","...I simply can't find the words to describe how I feel about this film. This is unusual because I am a man of words. I enjoy writing stories, reviews, and I even enjoyed writing book reports in high school and college. Nonetheless, the correct words have escaped me. Never, in my life, have I seen a more pretentious and contrived piece of propagandist garbage. That's really all that I can say. Mere words are insufficient, in this case.",1,2,7,23 August 2018
Don't Breathe," What's brown and sounds like a bell?
","Dung. Just to clarify, this movie is also brown and sounds like a bell. Before you fall for the reviews and dive nose-first into it, please try to understand a few things...This is a film (a thriller film, apparently) that aims to portray the perpetrators of home invasions as God-fearing victims with pure motives, war veterans as insane, murderous rapists that hunt by scent and echolocation, and old blind men as reclusive, unhygienic, and insane.The plot is pretty simple. Three degenerate young adults (well, two degenerate young adults and a rich boy; an aspiring degenerate young adult, I suppose) are having a good old time burgling people's houses to raise money to move to California. Right off the bat, it becomes impossible for a rational, thinking individual to sympathize, in any way, with these people. They are initially shown to not only be robbing a house but, also, vandalizing said house, with one of them either urinating or ejaculating on the kitchen floor. Hey! It's OK, though! The girl (Rocky) is shown to come from a broken home shortly after, so she is completely justified in everything she does, right? I suppose all of the rest of us who got the shaft in life and did something productive with ourselves took the easy way out, right? Anyway, their fence informs them that they should consider actually stealing money if they want to make more money than they would make fencing stolen goods. Wow. Who would have thought? Seriously, who would have thought?! So, they break into an 'Army vet's' house because they get a tip that he was compensated years earlier for the death of his daughter by the family of the daft teenage girl that was apparently being daft like a daft teenage girl is daft when she hit the poor guy's daughter with her car and killed her.As it turns out, the old guy is blind and, oddly enough, not very fond of having people break into his house. He proceeds to play a game of cat and mouse with the invaders, picking them off one by one, and then... I'm not even going to bother with how ridiculous it gets with the plot twist. I guess you'll just have see for yourself if you're intent on wasting your time.Jumping to the end, the girl ends up getting away with something like 1 million dollars from the old guy's house; the same one that was begging God for help at one point; the same one who left the bodies of her partners to rot; the same one that did nothing for the girl in the basement (like I said, you'll have to see for yourself); this girl makes it to California to live it up with her daughter/little sister/who cares with absolutely no consequences.Morale of the story? If you're a pretty female, it doesn't matter if you drove a man insane by carelessly slaughtering one of his family members with your car, it doesn't matter if you are selfishly robbing houses to sate your greed and avoid working to make a living. The fact is, you are always the victim, all the time, no matter what. Thanks for the insight, Hollywood. I've already finished writing it down on this piece of paper, and... **FLUSH**",1,33,57,23 February 2017
Man on Fire," A 'Must See Before You Die' Film (Spoilers)
","The story of a broken man who has abandoned all hope and feels as though he will never find a means of redemption for his sins. He finds friendship in the innocence of a child, however, and willingly lays down his life to save her; 'greater love has no one than is...' It's been done before, but this is quite possibly the best that I have ever seen.The reunion between Creasy (Washington) and Lupita (Fanning) at the end of this movie is, without a doubt, one of those scenes that makes any grown man with a soul and a daughter, niece, or otherwise young lady in his life that he loves dearly, tear up, no matter how thick-skinned he may be. There is no trash-talking, no epic gun-fighting, and no explosions; only a brave man accepting his fate; willingly dying to preserve her life and innocence.This movie is, easily, a 10/10. It is a movie that you have to see before you die.",10,4,6,15 January 2017
