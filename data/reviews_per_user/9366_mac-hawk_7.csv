Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Good Stuff
","Thoroughly enjoyed it. Much better than the first film. Downey Junior plays a much more eccentric Holmes to good effect. His play-off's with Law are good with some nice comical touches. Jared Harris is a great addition to the cast, playing the inscrutable Moriarty with the right amount of menace & intelligence without going anywhere near pantomime territory. Paul Anderson is good as Moriarty's chief sidekick but both the female leads are somewhat pointless and whilst there's nothing wrong with the acting from Rapace & Reilly they are pretty superfluous in the grand scheme of things.Ah, the Stephen Fry character, Mycroft Holmes, is - well, in my opinion, it just about works, it certainly works better in the first half of the film than in the second, although there is a good comedic scene with Kelly Reilly later in the film. I think Fry could be utilised better in the next episode.The action scenes are great as is the cinematography.The main irritant I have with the film, and it's been mentioned in other reviews, is the use of the slow-mo in all the action scenes. It's simply used too much to be truly effective, it works in the scene when running through the woods but elsewhere it's overdone, something Ritchie needs to curb in the next episode.All in all a good attempt but could do better",8,0,3,25 December 2011
Cold Mountain," A valiant attempt but not quite there
","It's initial premise is based on the American Civil War but it's ultimately a love story. We start at the beginning of the war where the main characters (Kidman & Law) are obviously aware of each other and there's an obvious attraction, they have a passionate kiss on the day he leaves for the war. The main thrust of this film is for Law's character to return to Kidman's and his struggles to achieve that and her struggles to survive until he returns. The reason it fails to convince is that we don't see enough of this relationship before Law's character leaves for battle - it's difficult to believe the premise that 2 people yearn for each other so much given they've had so little contact. Everything else is just about fine, Renee Zellweger and her incumbent father and his entourage are lovely additions as is the threat from the gang chasing deserters. Sure it's a long film but it does hold the interest and the cinematography is great. An honourable attempt that doesn't quite make it but worth a watch nonetheless.",7,0,1,22 November 2009
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Two films in one
","A filmed to be looked upon in two ways, either a disaster or a worthwhile attempt.As a second installment of 'The Hobbit' it's an unmitigated disaster. Even more so than Pt 1 'An unexpected journey' it deviates, omits, twists, changes and even adds to the narrative of the book so much as to make it barely recognisable from the original text.I'm not going into detail here as this could run to a 3,000 word draft but if you're expecting a version of the children's book full of its quirky characters, sections of humour, general sense of danger that's not too dark or threatening.....well forget it. You won't see that here.However, as the second prequel to the Lord of The Rings film trilogy it works fine. Full of dark brooding danger, lots of loud music, incessant Orc killing (some of which is veering on pantomime though), loads of scenes referencing to events which will be revealed in the LOTR films, and if you haven't read The Hobbit, you'll probably enjoy it.Either way, the final section with Bilbo & Smaug just about works, but the film condenses their conversations to a single visit. In the context of the film this is a bit overlong, but it additionally preludes another far too long, and unnecessary section where the dwarfs (without wishing to add a spoiler) run about a lot and the special effects team go bonkers.Viewed the film at the cinema in a party of six (5 had read the book). 4 thought it was really good - the one who hadn't read the book can't wait for The Hobbit 3 to be released - 1 thought the dragon sequence far too long (like myself) and I, well the review above.",7,1,2,29 December 2013
2012," Pure Hocum
","Well, if you've read the reviews you'll already have an idea what this is all about. The ultimate disaster movie? I think not, sure the special effects are good as is the surround sound but the plots pretty thin and very predictable. The characters create little sympathy and at times you just wish they'd all die. Whilst the film tries it's best to 'internationalize' the ensuing catastrophe there's little doubt that it's the good old US of A's players that will ultimately save the day. The casting is nothing special and the acting similar. Woody Harrelson gives a good OTT performance as the obligatory weirdo who sees it all coming but Danny Glover is oddly unconvincing as the President of the USA. It's, well ..... okay - if you can put your brain to one side for two and a half hours and like CGI & lots of noise then you'd probably enjoy this.",6,0,1,17 November 2009
Slap Shot," Just Brill
","Well I'm from the UK so all those people that have commented that it's 'just like the real thing' doesn't really connect with me as Ice Hockey is a minority sport in the UK.However, I was a cinema projectionist when this was released and me and all my colleagues loved this. The jokes, the violence and Paul Newmans performance was spot on.There's lots of spoilers you could put in here, and the dyke bit is a comedic gem, but I ain't elaborating.After a slow start it did surprisingly well at our cinemas box office.I've watched it again recently on DVD and it's just as good as I remembered.",8,1,2,19 January 2010
Avatar," Vastly overrated
","Firstly to say that I've only seen the 2D version.For such a high profile film that had garnered so many favourable views I have to say this must be the worst (high profile film) I have ever seen.I had not read the database before viewing the film but recalled the reviews on it's release. The first thing one has to say is the plot, as other have mentioned, is a direct lift from Dances With Wolves.To quote Edmund Blackadder 'it was as predictable as a predictable thing can be predicted', something I was quite (un)happily doing throughout the film. It isn't even so bad it's good - although there a couple of unintentionally funny scenes (well I laughed).The actors do the best they can with a very average script with Steven Lang as the main hate character in a destroy everything sort of way, played so over the top he could be a pantomime villain. It's not his fault of course, James Cameron directed him! The CG graphics/special effects look OK but gave me no real sense of warmth to the characters, I didn't find then innovative just a bit soulless.If 2 and a half hours of overly blue CGI/Special effects is your thing OK but I found it a total waste of the time.",2,6,11,27 December 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Almost brilliant
","This is a review of the trilogy. Doesn't faithfully follow the book - why should it, it's a film - but carries it's essence throughout. Across the 12 hours (extended versions) there's very little to criticise really. Using John Rhys Davies (who plays Gimli) as the voice of Treebeard wasn't a great idea and in the parting to the Grey Havens (end of 3) the hobbit stand-ins are really awful - you just know they're kids - I'm amazed they didn't see fit to shoot it better. I suppose a Scottish & American accent, both from The Shire, well, you soon get used to it. The acting is top rate and the special effects, at the time of production/cinema release, are stunning. This is a score of 9.75 for the trilogy to me.Incidentally, if you can, check out the BBC Radio play version of LOTR directed by Brian Sibley, it's fantastic.",9,1,4,4 November 2009
