Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Appalling concept, but strangely appealing
","First, let me say that we shouldn't be wasting our time with this sort of thing. Things are bad enough without having a generation whose first thought of Abraham Lincoln will be as a kung fu fighting vampire killer. This is all bought to you by the same type of people who run Ancient Aliens night and day on what's supposed to be the History Channel. It's bad for us.That being said, if you take away the CGI super-action, they do create a pretty good representation of the pre-war and Civil War era. Benjamin Walker is actually pretty convincing as Lincoln, especially considering all the silly stuff he has to do. The rest of the top line cast is good as well. So, despite all the problems with this whole thing, I was able to find things I liked in this movie. The ongoing discussion of slavery throughout the movie is taken on decently, almost making me wish that they could inject some more real history into this subject matter. See this movie if you're interested, but don't expect more than the usual big time CGI action adventure that will most likely leave you cold when it's over.",5,0,0,29 June 2017
World War Z," Bloated Product of Committee Thinking.
","We all heard that this movie had writing and script problems from the start. The final result shows that this movie was probably rewritten several times before it could be shot. What you get is an overblown, big budget disaster flick that doesn't look anything like a zombie movie. There doesn't appear to be anyone involved in this that knows what a monster movie should look like.Don't wait for the Hollywood rendition of your favorite parts of the book, because they're not there. By the time they gutted this, all that was left was the title.After a few years when this title is not such a hot property anymore, someone might revisit this. There are too many good elements in the book that were ignored in this picture. I hope somebody gives it a try.",4,2,4,20 July 2014
The Terminator," The Future Speaks with a German Accent
","This movie blew me away when I first saw it in the theater in 1984. It was futuristic and intense with a good action movie cast and, of course, Arnold. Look for Lance Henrickson, Paul Winfield and even Bill Paxton in an early role as punk #1.It's a sci fi classic now, and it set the bar the countless movies that came after it. If you line this movie up with Halloween, The Warriors, The Thing, Alien and a few others from the late '70s to the mid '80s, you have what amounts to a latter day golden age of science fiction/action/horror films.If you're a fan, you've seen this movie countless times. If you haven't seen it, see it now. It's definitely better than the sequels.",10,5,6,2 July 2014
Hotel Rwanda," The Tragedy the World Refuses to Remember
","While America was transfixed by O.J. Simpson and his low-speed chase in a white Ford Bronco, the worst humanitarian tragedy since WWII was taking place in Rwanda.Don Cheadle excels as the Hutu manager of a Belgian luxury hotel who does whatever is necessary to save as many people as possible while a Hutu militia, largely incited by government radio, engage in an unrelenting slaughter of Rwanda's Tutsi minority. Cheadle and the people he is trying to protect hold out in the hotel protected only by a small contingent of UN troops led by Nick Nolte, whose number one order is to avoid a firefight with the locals. Cheadle effectively balances diplomacy and bribery to keep the Hutu warlords out of the hotel and to buy precious time for him and his people to ride out the massacre. The film accurately portrays the total failure of the 'world community' to take action that could have prevented the massacre of hundreds of thousands. The UN and other organizations have detailed files and reports of this occurrence that can be read on line by anyone who is interested in this. In those files you will learn there was a similar incident there in 1970 that claimed 100,000 lives. They're real good at writing up reports after the fact, but they were useless in preventing or limiting this tragedy. That's essentially what this movie tells us as well.",8,2,2,7 October 2017
Rocky IV," Rocky IV- Completely Out of Ideas
","Leave it to Hollywood to take a good concept and run it right into the ground. Rocky IV is even more overblown than Rocky III, which, while being a fairly decent movie, was a monument to everything that was tacky about the 1980s.You'll get the idea here pretty quick. Rocky vanquished all the domestic competition in the first three movies, so now he has to take on a Russian superfighter, a communist giant with no conscience and trained with cutting edge, high-tech 1980s Soviet boxing methods. (This movie came out during abrief period in history when there was a popular belief that the Soviet Union possessed advanced scientific training methods that enabled them to beat the rest of the world in Olympic sports. After awhile we all figured out they were just shooting everyone up with enormous amounts of steroids). By the fourth movie, Rocky is little more than a flawed, rough edged boxing themed superhero, and the whole thing has degenerated from Oscar caliber material to action movie status. It looks real good, I'll give it that. They spent lots of money on it. But if you watch the original Rocky and then watch this, you'll just be depressed with where they decided to go with the thing.",5,2,5,14 July 2017
Rocky III," Rocky Goes Hollywood
","If Rocky and Rocky II are the crown jewels of this franchise, then Rocky III has to be its gold plated pinky ring, complementing a faux Gucci wardrobe spritzed with bad cologne.Rocky goes Hollywood in the third installment of the series as he tries to find himself while training in LA to battle Mr. T, who at least looks good as a sports movie villain. It's not a terrible movie. You get what you've already come to expect from Rocky movies- good action, Rocky's ongoing conflicts and also a little more insight into Apollo Creed who was always one of the most interesting characters in the series. The only problem here is that Rocky III just screams '80s movie' louder than anything you've ever seen- with juiced up bodies, oily training montages and Eye of the Tiger kicking in all over the place. You could be forgiven if you thought you tuned into Miami Vice by mistake. So, it's a little tackier than the first two but probably the last one that was really any good.",7,5,7,20 April 2017
Zombieland," Second Best Zombie Comedy of all Time
","If you feel like you got cheated with World War Z (and I'm here to tell you- you did), you'll find an excellent antidote to that feeling with Zombieland. It starts out with one of the greatest opening credits ever with Metallica's For Whom the Bell Tolls as the theme music, and it takes off from there. This one's got good action and comedy and good character interaction as well as a cool special guest star.It runs neck and neck with Return of the Living Dead as the best zombie comedy ever. (I think they're both better than Shaun of the Dead, although that one is real close in the running as well). Zombieland gets knocked to second just for being a big time Hollywood release with a big budget and big stars. You get docked a point for that. Zombies are best as a low budget and indie subject, but it's easy to forgive them for that sin in this case.",8,1,2,14 July 2017
Edge of Tomorrow," I Expected a Trainwreck...
","I didn't have high hopes for Edge of Tomorrow when it recently popped up on cable, but this really turns into something interesting. You'll catch on to the Groundhog Day idea of a soldier perpetually reliving a pivotal battle pretty quickly. They take that idea off into an intriguing direction when our soldier and a second who'd had the same experience edge closer and closer to turning the tide of the war with each relived day.You will get bogged down in a good amount of CGI super-action, but there's apparently no other way to make a film like this at the present time.",7,0,0,28 November 2019
Scream," Great Horror Send Up!
","A masked killer called Ghostface stalks Neve Campbell and her teen friends- this is all you need as a lead in to Scream. It's a great send up to an otherwise tired and overworked genre full of good humor and self awareness. Without giving away too much, one character figures out early that they're being disposed of by the well established slasher movie rules. Neve Campbell is perfect as the classic, sexually repressed victim/heroine. Skeet Ulrich probably has the best part in this, channeling James Dean as Campbell's boyfriend. Good writing and good plot twists raise this above the usual by-the-numbers body count flick where you walk out wondering how you spent two hours of your life on it. In your standard issue slasher movie, your supporting cast is usually made up of poorly defined, soon to be slaughtered characters. Scream couldn't do without its supporting cast. Courtney Cox and David Arquette are particularly good. You'll also see Matt Lillard, Drew Barrymore and Jamie Kennedy in good parts. Look for Linda Blair and Henry Winkler in walk-on parts as well.While there's a good level of slasher movie violence, most of this movie is pretty watchable. So, watch Scream if you haven't already. Just like the killer- you don't even need a motive.",8,0,0,22 March 2017
