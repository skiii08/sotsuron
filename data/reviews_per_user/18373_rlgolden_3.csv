Mission: Impossible III," Best of three May blockbusters
","May seems to be the month studios release their best summer movies and this year MI3, X-Men and Da Vinci Code were the three biggies. Of those 3 the best is easily Mission Impossible III. In the first installment in six years, Cruise continues his role as Ethan Hunt and Ving Rhames returns as Luther Stickell but bad guy Philip Seymour Hoffman seems to dominate the entire film in spite of the fact that he's not in that many scenes.Introduced in an unnerving sequence at the beginning of the film that is thankfully not repeated in context, Hoffman displays his incredible talent at understatement, even when he is suppose to be Cruise. Of course, Cruise does the usual running, jumping off tall buildings and is repeatedly saved by various ropes just long enough to break his fall before he hits something. Probably the best scene for pyrotechnic fans is Hoffman's escape from an armored car on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel.",8,1,1,6 June 2006
The Da Vinci Code," A ho-hum effort from an incredible team
","When you begin with Ron Howard and Tom Hanks, throw in a pretty girl and some incredibly talented 'character' actors like Ian McKellan and Jean Reno, you probably would expect a grade A movie. The best I can give it is a seven, and it probably deserves that much. Hooray to Howard for not including much sex (one brief scene flashes on the screen in black and white) in a movie that has Tom Hanks pretty much mopes his way through a maze of religious demagoguery that combines reasonable historic truth with unreasonable religious fiction.Having been one of the few who never read the book I might not catch everything, but the movie simply takes too long to get where its going, and even then the muddled ending left me questioning if it was an introduction for a sequel or actually had a meaning?",7,0,2,21 May 2006
War of the Worlds," Better than the majority think
","As I am writing this War of the Worlds has a 6.8 average with 35,000 votes. The sad thing is that it deserves better. Tom Cruise turns in a good (but not great) performance as the dad trying to save his two kids in the massive alien invasion. Not up to The Last Samurai or Mission Impossible, but still convincing. Young Dakota Fanning is the stand-out here, and she has been standing out against some pretty big names recently.Watch for Gene Barry as 'grandfather' at the end of the movie. He was in the original 'War of the Worlds' back in 1953. His co-star (who I did not recognize) plays 'grandmother'.",8,1,3,20 August 2005
