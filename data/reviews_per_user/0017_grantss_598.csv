Ford v Ferrari," Incredibly entertaining
","It is the early-1960s and Ford Motor Corporation's fortunes are at a low ebb. In order to boost sales, Ford aims to win the Le Mans 24-hour race, a race dominated by Ferrari over the last few years. To head their team they call in Carroll Shelby, who won Le Mans in 1959. He in turn makes Ken Miles his chief test driver. Together they make a formidable team. However, it is not just Ferrari they have to worry about. Office politics and powerplays within Ford are an even greater threat to the success of the project.I did not have high hopes for this movie before watching it. Despite it being nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, it seemed just like a conventional revhead movie. Turns out, it's better than that, far better than that.Director James Mangold crafts a story that is highly engaging and very fast-paced. You wouldn't know the movie is 2 Â½ hours long it is so engrossing: the time speeds by. The racing scenes are amazing, capturing the pace, danger and excitement of motor racing. Throw in good performances by Matt Damon and Christian Bale and you have a first-rate movie.Not perfect though. I found the political machinations a bit of a drag and contrived-feeling (even though many of them were true!). While Christian Bale puts in a good performance as Ken Miles, Miles's character is drawn rather stereotypically English, complete with ever-present cups of tea. It seemed a bit trite.Overall: highly entertaining. Don't be put off by the movie's duration: the time whizzes by.",8,3,4,23 February 2020
The King's Speech," Great movie, driven by a great cast
","Great movie, driven by a great cast.Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush are excellent as King George VI and

Great performances from the supporting cast too - especially Helena Bonham Carter (as Queen Elizabeth), Guy Pearce (as King Edward VIII) and Michael Gambon (as King George V).Direction is flawless: pacing is spot on, story flows well,
cinematography cannot be faulted. Script is solid.Not the best movie of 2010/11, no matter what happened at the Oscars,
but one of the best.",9,0,0,19 February 2018

Despicable Me 2," Good fun
","Sweet, feel-good movie. Quite predicable and not laugh-a-minute funny, and mostly quite empty for the middle section of the movie, it has a good heart and finished strongly. Probably more a kids movie than an adults movie though.Thus, very similar to the first Despicable Me: good start, drifts a lot in the middle, finishes strongly with some nice emotional touches. Animation is great, as expected. The choices of the voice stars is spot- on. Steve Carell steals the show, of course, but the remainder are good too.Not a classic, but good fun nevertheless.",6,0,0,16 June 2014
Saturday Night Fever," OK, but not great
","OK, but not great. Music (by the Bee Gees) is fantastic, and the dance sequences are great. However, the human drama side is pretty uneventful and mostly quite dull. The characters, including the leads, are mostly so loathsome it is hard to feel any empathy.Performances are so-so. John Travolta does well in the lead role, seeming to inhabit the character. No real stand-outs, otherwise.Not a great movie, but a great piece of nostalgia from the disco days of the 1970s.",6,1,2,15 April 2015
The Lobster," Novel idea...and that's all
","Set in a dystopian, fascist future, single people are sent to a hotel where they must find a partner in 45 days or get turned into a wild animal of their choice. David's wife has just left him, after 11 years of marriage, and he is sent the hotel. His chosen animal, should he not find a partner, is a lobster.Quite intriguing, initially. The whole idea and set up was so inane you felt compelled to stick with it. The sheer novelty of it all sucks you in.However, almost as quickly, the cracks in the concept and plot start to appear. Why do people go along with the preposterous idea? If they are forced to find a partner, why not just find anyone and pretend to be a couple, rather than suffer this fate? While obviously the central idea is quite ridiculous, it is the way people respond to it that is truly implausible and sets the movie up to fail.Also, why does the opposite of this 'couples are everything' regime have to be a 'being a perpetual loner is the only way to go' group. Surely there can be a middle ground? The extreme polarity of it all was irritating. Despite these flaws, however, there was a chance this could develop into an interesting drama. I figured I was happy to overlook these obvious faults if the movie got some momentum. Alas, no, it just gets worse and worse. From a point the plot just becomes very random and, ultimately, pointless.Only worth watching if you're curious to know what all the fuss is about, but be prepared to be disappointed.",3,10,14,12 March 2017
Moneyball," Brilliant
","I must admit that I was very sceptical about Hollywood making the book into a movie. I enjoyed the book immensely, but did not see how it could be made into a movie.I was wrong, very wrong. Moneyball is brilliant!The adaptation of Michael Lewis's book by Aaron Sorkin et al is imaginative, yet doesn't take much poetic licence versus the book. Bennett MIller, directing only his second movie (the first was 'Capote'), keeps the movie moving, and doesn't get bogged down with some of the minor details. A faithful reproduction of the book would have been dry, and a documentary.Brad Pitt provides the star power and puts in a good performance. Jonah Hill is surprisingly good in a dramatic role. Good support from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Robin Wright.Very entertaining, and ultimately thought-provoking and uplifting. Yes, I am a baseball nut, but I don't that being one is essential to enjoying this movie.",9,2,3,25 February 2019
The Avengers," All style, no substance
","Your typical modern action movie: all style, no substance. Plot is close to non-existent, or, at least, incomprehensible. Very jumbled, entirely because the writers wanted to somehow meld all the individual Avenger stories into one story. Makes for a contrived mess.As expected, the special effects and action sequences are good. Hard to compliment performances in an action movie, as there is very little real acting involved. However, Robert Downey Jr puts in a show- stealing performance.On the whole, vastly over-rated (and this is probably a sign of how dumbed-down the general population is with regard to expectations for movies). The only positive thing I can say is: it's better than Transformers, but that says very little.",4,4,9,28 August 2015
Blade Runner 2049," Intriguing and engaging
","It is 2049, 30 years after the events of the previous movie. K is a Blade Runner, a policeman who tracks down and terminates replicants (androids) whose model are viewed dangerous to society. K is himself a replicant, but has been programmed to be beneficial to society. One day he tracks down and terminates a replicant that has managed to evade detection and capture for over 28 years. In his garden are found the remains of a female replicant. Shockingly, the woman died during childbirth and the baby appears to have survived. Replicants cannot reproduce. If word gets out that they can, the human-replicant hierarchy will forever be disturbed. K must find the child, quickly. Also after it is Niander Wallace, a billionaire whose company makes replicants and whose main interest is in changing the world order.An intriguing and engaging movie, directed by Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Incendies, Sicario, Arrival) and co-written by Hampton Francher, who co-wrote the screenplay for the original Blade Runner. Good plot with some great twists and turns. Some clever manipulation of the viewer too, as you are funneled down one way of thinking, only to have things turn out in another direction. This unpredictability, and requirement that you use your brain, makes for some intriguing viewing.Great special effects, without being too show-offy and gratuitous. Great action scenes too.While I have seen the original Blade Runner (in all three forms), you don't have to have seen it in order to enjoy, or even understand, this one. It works fine as a standalone movie.Solid performances by all involved.On the negative side, the plot is not entirely water-tight. There are a few key moments where things take a turn for the implausible and contrived. The end result ultimately justified these turns, making me less critical of them, but the writers could easily have developed the plot around those moments more, in order to make them less loose and clumsy.Though I thought it was going to be, the running time of 163 minutes is not an issue. The movie never drags and the time just flies by. Great movie - certainly not your average sequel.",8,50,112,6 October 2017
Million Dollar Arm," Has its moments but mostly formulaic and dull
","Has its moments but mostly formulaic and dull.The (true) story of how a US sports agent goes to India to find baseball pitchers, stages a competition to unearth them, takes the two winners' back to the US and tries to get them contracts with MLB teams.From the start the movie feels trite and overly sugary. Yes, the setting is fairly original but it just feels like we've been down this road before. Maybe it because it is told in a made-for-TV/kids sort of way.The movie is not without its upsides though. There are some funny moments and the John Hamm-Lake Bell relationship was interesting.For all its portrayal of a reasonably important event in baseball history, the movie just feels very flat.",5,0,1,10 June 2015
Angels & Demons," Contrived and boring
","Contrived and boring.The Da Vinci code was fairly boring, living off only its controversial theories. Strip that aspect away and it was contrived, linear and predictable.Angels and Demons is even worse. Even more contrived, and now Tom Hanks proves that even great actors can't overcome crappy scripts and listless direction. Hanks hams it up, and looks like an amateur.At 140 minutes, Ron Howard also fails to observe the first rule of movie-making - if you can't make a good movie, make a short one.Avoid.",2,1,2,9 December 2015
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Brilliant movie(s)
","(Review of Vol 1 and Vol 2).Brilliant movie(s).A young woman is shot and left for dead at her wedding. Her entire wedding party is massacred in cold blood. After four years in a coma she awakes and systematically sets out to wreak revenge on the people responsible, especially their leader, Bill...Fantastic movie in two parts, written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. Solid, original plot, good character depth, cool dialogue (as you would expect from Tarantino), good action scenes. Good use too of time-jumps, a Tarantino trademark.Good performances too.Of the two movies, I preferred Vol 2 to Vol 1 (though there is not much in it - Vol 2 is a 10, Vol 1 a 9). Vol 1 was more about action, with a massive fight scene towards the end. It had plot, but was more the start of a plot, with many loose threads.Vol 2 had plot development and character development and was less about action (though there was still enough of it). Thus more substance in Vol 2, more style in Vol 1, and substance beats style.",10,2,3,1 January 2016
First Man," Enthralling telling of a momentous event in human history
","The life of Neil Armstrong. Starts in 1961, with Armstrong as a test pilot and ends, shows the Gemini and Apollo projects and culminates in Armstrong's most famous event: being the first man on the moon.Directed by Damien Chazelle (La La Land, Whiplash), a great, riveting telling of the man behind and the events leading up to one of the momentous events in human history. Shows incredibly well the development of the NASA space program, the dangers involved, the sacrifices made, the narrow margin for error and the courage and determination involved.The space flight scenes are incredibly realistic, often putting you in Armstrong's shoes. Even though you know how it is going to end, you're still on the edge of your seat throughout these scenes. Very nerve-wracking, gritty and engaging.Unfortunately, Chazelle can't replicate this engagement in the Earth-bound scenes, especially the scenes showing Armstrong's home life. The domestic stuff is pretty dull. Some of this is deliberate. Chazelle wants to show Armstrong as cold and calculating and show how this is a positive and negative: what makes him a great astronaut makes him less perfect as a husband and father. It's also a counter-point to the sheer adrenaline rush that is his job.However, the domestic stuff never leads to any great profundity and ultimately is largely filler. Chazelle could have cut most, if not all, of it out of the movie and we would have had a perfect film.",9,1,2,25 May 2019
The Legend of Bagger Vance," Entertaining at times, but mostly predictable and trite
","Rannulph Junuh was once a great golfer but serving in WW1 has left him a shell of his former self. He is invited to play in a exhibition golf tournament - the only other two competitors are two all-time greats, Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen. Junuh is then approached by a mysterious man who offers to be his caddie - Bagger Vance.Entertaining at times, but mostly predictable and trite. The plot is far-fetched, holey and filled with platitudes. Fairly good acting by Matt Damon and Charlize Theron. Will Smith overdoes the home-spun advice witticisms and his character, that of Bagger Vance, becomes irritating.Directed by Robert Redford. He is capable of much better efforts, as 'Ordinary People', 'Quiz Show' and 'A River Runs Through It' demonstrated.",5,0,1,28 October 2017
Vertigo," Not sure why this is so highly regarded
","I don't see why this is regarded so highly. Do people feel obliged to love Alfred Hitchcock movies? Psycho, Rear Window and Rebecca were masterpieces but Vertigo is not in their league, not even close.I personally found Vertigo long-winded and ultimately quite boring. Hitchcock takes forever to set the scene, then having set it, instead of ramping up the pace, continues to drag out the story. Many of the key turning points and pieces of the plot seemed contrived and implausible. Good performances by James Stewart, Kim Novak and Barbara Bel Geddes though.",5,4,10,12 February 2017
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Wonderful, hilarious, campy fun
","Wonderful, hilarious, campy fun.Two drag queens, Felicia (played by Guy Pearce) and Mitzi (Hugo Weaving), and a transsexual, Bernadette (Terrence Stamp), leave Sydney for Alice Springs in order to play a series of shows. Their mode of transport - a bus, Priscilla. Their appearance in rural towns gets mixed reactions...Very funny movie. Dialogue is razor-sharp and wittily clever. The characters themselves provide much of the entertainment, especially the over-the-topness of Felicia.Some interesting themes too, especially of tolerance and intolerance, and not prejudging people. Much of our characters' help and support comes from unexpected sources...Great work by the three leads. Guy Pearce is great as the larger- than-life, bitchy Felicia. Terrence Stamp provides the gravitas as Bernadette. Mitzi is the most complex character and Hugo Weaving does a great job in the role.Good support from Bill Hunter as Bob.",8,1,2,6 March 2016
Black Swan," Great psychological drama
","Great psychological drama, though not perfect. Incredibly intense plot and direction, allied with a superb performance by Natalie Portman, and good supporting performances from Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel and Barbara Hershey.However, it is not totally original nor unpredictable. The broader conclusion was quite foreseeable. If you have seen all of Darren Aronofsky's previous movies, Black Swan will seem like an amalgam of them. The ending is very reminiscent of The Wrestler and the fantasy scenes reminiscent of Pi and, especially, Requiem For a Dream.A great movie though I can't help but feel that the themes and broad plot are not at all original.",8,1,3,6 March 2014
Changeling," Brilliant, powerful, moving movie
","Brilliant, powerful, moving movie. Being directed by Clint Eastwood would imply all those qualities though. This movie has all the Eastwood trademarks - the character development, the delicate plot development and emotional manipulation, the powerful acting performances, the melancholy and perfect-fitting score, the perfect pacing.Angelina Jolie, whom I'm generally not a fan of, gives an amazing performance, reminding us that the Oscar she won for 'Girl, Interrupted' was well deserved.Superb.",10,2,3,19 April 2014
Come and See," Powerful, brutal WW2 drama
","1943, German-occupied Belarus. A teenage boy, Florya, joins the partisans and expects a life of duty and adventure. Little prepares him for the terror and brutality he will witness.Power, brutal WW2 drama. Shows the horror of war - certainly not your average glamour-and-glory WW2 movie. In particular, demonstrates well the atrocities the Germans, and the SS especially, inflicted on Russian civilians in WW2.Not perfect though. Starts in haphazard style, with plot developments that sometimes don't make sense or seem random. Some of the acting can be a bit hammy at times too. However, from a point the movie finds its focus and from then on it is a relentless, gritty, tension-filled ride.",9,1,1,20 May 2018
Frost_Nixon," Brilliant
","Brilliant. Ron Howard crafts the David Frost interview of Richard Nixon into a sporting event, with punch and counter-punch, mind games, agony and ecstasy. A very well-told story, with examinations of both protagonists characters, mindsets and motives.Howard keeps the movie going, never getting mired in over-sentimentality or minor details. At no point does the plot drift.The cast is perfect for their roles: Frank Langella as Richard Nixon, Michael Sheen as David Frost, Kevin Bacon as Nixon's Chief-of-Staff Jack Brennan, Sam Rockwell as James Reston jr and Oliver Platt as Bob Zelnick. All deliver outstanding performances.A fascinating expose of one of the more notorious incidents in American history, and the interview that made a TV legend.",10,1,2,9 April 2014
Howl's Moving Castle," Devoid of substance but kids should like it
","Devoid of substance but kids should like it.A shy young woman, Sofi, is cursed by a bitter witch. As a result she becomes very old. She sets off in search of a means to break the curse. Soon she encounters a giant moving castle, owned by young man, Howl...Pretty much your standard Hayao Miyazaki movie. Intriguing set-up but the movie quickly degenerates into a rambling adventure for a plot with random action scenes and equally random solutions to problems, and no character depth or engagement. Howl's Moving Castle escalates into randomness sooner than most, making it even worse than normal.No real themes or profundities (par for the course, again). All this - rambling, random plot, lack of character depth, no profundities - make this unsuitable for intelligent adults. Kids should like it though.",4,5,12,9 March 2016
Walk the Line," Wonderfully engaging and entertaining biopic
","The story of Johnny Cash, music legend. From his time growing up on a small farm in Arkansas, to his time in the US Air Force where his musical talented first started to manifest itself, to the early days of his career, through the trials and tribulations of being a star and beyond. We also see his relationships, particularly with his older brother Jack, his father, his first wife Vivian, and, most importantly, with June Carter.A wonderfully engaging and entertaining biopic. We get to see the Johnny Cash story, warts and all. It does seem to concentrate on his relationship with June Carter too much, but this is necessary, as this relationship shapes his life, to a large extent. Well told, with solid direction by James Mangold. Is fairly linear in its telling, but there's a vibrancy and energy to it all that keeps it going.Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as Johnny Cash, perfectly capturing his mannerisms, especially those on-stage. Similarly, Reese Witherspoon is wonderful as June Carter. The chemistry between them is spot-on. To add to the brilliance of their performances, both actually sang in their roles - no lip-syncing to Cash/Carter recordings - and they absolutely nail it. Phoenix got a Best Actor Oscar nomination and Witherspoon a Best Actress Oscar for their efforts.Talking of the music, as you would imagine, it is great and captures well the genius that was Johnny Cash.",10,0,0,12 June 2016
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Hilariously funny
","Hilariously funny.Sacha Baron Cohen takes his blend of irreverent slapstick and candid camera skits, perfected through Da Ali G Show, to the big screen. Borat was a regular character on Da Ali G Show and now he gets his own movie.Half candid, half staged, totally funny. It just works on so many levels. The central plot is okay, but is merely just s device for Borat;s antics.Sending up people's ignorance, playing them for a fool or simply using them as background - so many victims. Sometimes Cohen's sheer nerve and chutzpah has to be seen to be believed...Once you strip away the jokes, you get a feeling for the superficiality of modern culture. Sometimes you need a naive (faux) foreigner to show you how wrong society has gone...",9,2,3,10 May 2014
Alien 3," Not in the same league as the first two
","Following the events of Aliens, Ripley crash-lands on a prison planet, Fiorina 161. The other passengers die and, more tellingly, Ripley discovers that she has transferred on of the aliens onto the planet via her ship.The original Alien was excellent. The sequel Aliens was good. It is inevitable that making a 2nd sequel that the originality will suffer, and Alien 3 is no exception. Still entertaining, but carried by the presence of Signourney Weaver. The plot is fairly predictable though - all that has changed is the setting.Not as good as the first two, and certainly not in the same league as the original.",6,0,1,9 December 2017
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Sherlock Holmes, action hero
","The first Sherlock Holmes wasn't too bad: dark, intriguing, though it drifted at times. This sequel is not intriguing at all. Rather than being a detective-drama, this is an action-drama, and a pretty stock-standard, mindless, predictable one at that.Add to that the fact that the characters are now very prissy and Victorian Englishy - the original wasn't that irritating was it?Not worth seeing at all.",3,1,2,22 December 2019
The Monuments Men," Interesting and original idea, poorly developed and executed
","1944. With the tide of WW2 turning against Germany, the Allies set up a team to find and retrieve hordes of priceless art, stolen by the Germans during their occupation of Europe. Due to the fear that the Germans will destroy the artworks, the team need to be as close to the frontlines as possible, putting them in great danger.An interesting and novel concept, as the search and recovery of the artwork the Nazis stole actually happened, and was a tremendous feat, yet the story is hardly known nor told. So the movie had the potential to show the search in a gritty and edifying manner. Unfortunately, in going from concept to script, The Monuments Men goes from good to mediocre and just gets worse when filmed. Written by George Clooney and Grant Hersov and directed by Clooney, the finished product is sloppily written and amateurishly directed. Cheesy, sanctimonious and not historically or militarily correct, the movie starts badly and never recovers. Instead of being an edifying drama, Clooney tries to throw in humour, lowering the tone, and then the humour is very weak and unoriginal. Even the comedy skills of Bill Murray and John Goodman aren't a match for a poor script.It feels like an Oceans movie: assemble heaps of friends and other big-name stars, give them back-slapping dialogue and make it feel like one huge in-joke.",4,2,4,28 September 2018
Antz," Sweet animated comedy
","Sweet animated comedy. Story is not that original but is very well told and animated. Hilariously funny at times.Voice cast is an all-star one: Woody Allen, Dan Aykroyd, Anne Bancroft, Danny Glover, Gene Hackman, Jennifer Lopez, Sylvester Stallone, Sharon Stone, Christopher Walken. Moreover, the cast delivers in spades - great casting.",7,1,1,30 April 2020
Lucky Number Slevin," A pleasant surprise

Requiem for a Dream," Brilliant - a searing depiction of drug addiction
","Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is a retired widow, living in a small apartment. She spends most of her time watching TV, especially a particular self-help show. She has delusions of rising above her current dull existence by being a guest on that show. Her son, Harry (Jared Leto) is a junkie but along with his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) has visions of making it big by becoming a drug dealer. Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) could be fashion designer or artist but is swept along in Harry's drug-centric world. Meanwhile Sara has developed an addiction of her own. She desperately wants to lose weight and so goes on a crash course involving popping pills, pills which turn out to be very addictive and harmful to her mental state.Brilliant. The best movie you'll ever see on drug addiction, its causes, its effects and how difficult it is to break out of. Incredibly intense - director Darren Aronovsky weaves a wonderful web of drawing the characters into a desperate situation and then slowly tightening the noose. The last few scenes of the movie are among the most harrowing, horrific-yet-compelling scenes ever committed to film. The intensity is off the chart.Aronovsky's brilliance doesn't end there. The editing is sublime - the short, sharp, image-by-image montages are incredibly effective and give a feel for the mania that is a junkie's life. Superb visual artistry. Excellent performance by Ellen Burstyn, for which she received a Best Leading Actress Oscar nomination (sadly, this was the movie's only Oscar nomination). Good work too by Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans.",10,0,1,7 October 2016
Your Name.," Reasonably interesting, but not great
","A teenage boy living in Tokyo and a teenage girl living in the country experience a strange, random phenomenon. They occasionally switch bodies for a day at a time, and then can't remember what happened while they were switched. The boy eventually sets out to find the girl, but the situation may be even more peculiar than he imagined.Reasonably interesting, though not overly engaging and quite schmaltzy. The switching places plot device didn't seem too original, reminding me of movies like Freaky Friday, and was often just a basis for silliness. However, once the plot progressed past the cheap fun part, the plot gained some intrigue. It didn't quite live up to its potential in that regard, resorting to clumsily layered cleverness and random departures to create a feeling of ingenuity, when this was really more style than substance. Still, did make it fairly interesting.Unfortunately there is a whole lot of trite schmalziness and empty sentimentality too, probably because the movie is aimed at the teenage market. In the end it feels a like Freaky Friday meets Christopher Nolan, dumbed down for teenagers. By aiming for a broader audience and avoiding the schmaltz, this could have been great. Instead it is just okay.",6,14,24,12 December 2017
Captain Phillips," Interesting, gripping drama
","Interesting, gripping drama. The true story of a US merchant vessel being hijacked by Somali pirates, how the situation unfolds and is dealt with.Meticulous plot build up, including showing some of Captain Phillips' home life plus the running of the ship. Even once the action starts, no detail is spared. This has a drawback in that the plot sometimes seems pedestrian, especially after an action scene. Is very much worth it in the end, as it heightens the tension and fills you in on where everyone is, mentally.Incredibly gripping, especially towards the end. You don't know how things are going to pan out, and several conclusions are possible.Superb performance by Tom Hanks (but that's a given). Good support from Barkhad Abdi, as the leader of the pirates.",8,1,2,19 August 2014
Sucker Punch," Even worse than I imagined
","Wow. I watched this not expecting much, but was still disappointed. This movie is incredibly bad. So devoid of substance it could be a Michael Bay movie. Sorry, that's not entirely correct: Michael Bay movies have more of a semblance of a plot.What a mess. Calling the plot 'random' flatters it. If Zack Snyder had a plan, it is not obvious. At best he was trying to make Girl Interrupted meets Lara Croft meets Inception. That's how muddled it is.More likely, like Michael Bay, Zack Snyder was just trying to show off his CGI and explosion-making skills. Screw the plot. Either that or this is the longest ever advert for a first-person- shooter computer game.Performances from Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish and Jena Malone aren't bad though, especially considering how little they had to work with. Avoid like the plague.",2,4,15,25 July 2014
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Incredible movie
","Beautiful, wonderful, thought-provoking, bittersweet and moving movie. Plot is intriguing, but it is more a character-based movie. The characters are well-developed and you feel an empathy for all of them. The lighter side of the characters is wonderful, the darker sides harrowing, giving a sense of real lives. Think of the movie as a darker, less Hollywood, version of an 80s John Hughes movie. If nothing else, the yearning back towards ones own teen years should be the main take-away from this movie.Excellent performances all round, especially from Logan Lerman in the lead role. Good support from Emma Watson and Ezra Miller. Paul Rudd, Dylan McDermott and Joan Cusack have lesser supporting parts.Excellent soundtrack too: The Smiths, David Bowie, New Order, Sonic Youth, among others.Incredible movie.",10,0,1,23 March 2014
10 Cloverfield Lane," Okay, but could have been so much better
","A woman, Michelle, is involved in a late-night car crash and knocked unconscious. When she comes to, she is a prisoner in a cell. She is in a concrete bunker deep under the farm house of Howard, who claims he saved her from the crash. Moreover, he claims that her being down here is for her own good, as the US has been attacked, using nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, and the air on the surface is not fit to breath. Michelle is deeply suspicious and thinks this is just a ruse to keep her imprisoned. She looks for ways to escape. She also discovers that there is a third person in the bunker, Emmett. The movie had heaps of potential. Very intriguing initially - the whole crazed kidnapper vs hiding from WW3/aliens puzzle. Even when the movie went more down one of these paths I was still thinking that this was a bluff and that it really was the other.However, was it sets off on the chosen path, there is little in the way of twists. Pretty much a linear story with a not-too-shocking revelation towards the end and some standard action scenes.Just felt very conventional, ultimately, when it could have been something very special.",6,1,2,16 January 2017
The Finest Hours," Enthralling story of courage and survival
","February 1952. Bernie Webber is a boatswain/Petty Officer at a Coast Guard station on the coast of Massachusetts. A massive storm is in progress out to sea, damaging two tankers to the point that they appear likely to sink. On one tanker, the Pendleton, the chief engineer, Ray Sybert, is using all his ingenuity, resourcefulness and experience to keep the ship afloat and buy time until help arrives. Unfortunately for him and his crew, the Coast Guard have sent their best crew and rescue boat to the other stricken tanker. When the Coast Guard discover the Pendleton's situation, Webber and a 3-man crew are sent to help. The odds are stacked against Webber - just leaving the harbour in those seas will require large amounts of skill, courage and luck. Then they have to find the Pendleton, without a compass, rescue the crew and somehow make it home safe.An enthralling (true) story of courage and survival. Compelling viewing - once the danger strikes, you're glued to your seat. What makes it so interesting is that they don't just focus on the efforts of the rescuers but also on the rescued. I found the Pendleton crew's story much more interesting than that of Webber and co - the ingenuity, resourcefulness and (reluctant) leadership of Sybert was amazing. This is helped by a great performance from Casey Affleck.Not all good though. Many of the characters seem like cartoon stereotypes - the negative naysayers, the clingy girlfriend/fiancée, the inept commander. The romantic angle was overplayed and not that necessary. It did add depth to Webber's character but not much.Performances vary. Casey Affleck is the stand-out as Sybert. Chris Pine is okay as Webber. Eric Bana is pretty weak and gives the worst American accent I've ever heard (I think it was supposed to be Southern but it varied so much and seemed so unnatural it was hard to tell). Holliday Grainger is a bit overbearing as Miriam, though that might have been intentional on the director's part.",7,10,11,31 December 2016
3:10 to Yuma," Good, but not great

The Sound of Music," Every bit the classic it is made out to be
","Every bit the classic it is made out to be. I am not a fan of musicals, but this is great. The scenes flow into the music seamlessly and perfectly. Just about every song sticks pleasantly in your head. Plot is fairly basic, but good. Direction by Robert Wise is spot-on. Cinematography is spectacular. The Austrian mountainscapes are amazingly beautiful and provide the perfect backdrop.Performances by Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are great. The kids are mostly unconvincing and overly sweet though.A movie everyone should watch.",9,4,5,12 December 2015
Ali," Great subject but, strangely, unengaging movie
","Great subject but, strangely, unengaging movie.The story of Muhammad Ali, one of the greatest, if not THE greatest, boxers who has ever lived. Shows from his first title bout (as Cassius Clay) until the conclusion of the 'Rumble in the Jungle' versus George Foreman. Covers his conversion to Islam, his relationships, his being drafted into the Army and his refusal to go, his subsequent legal issues and a myriad of other details.Interesting, from an historical perspective, but feels flat and unengaging as a human drama. On paper it should work - the movie is directed by Michael Mann, of Heat, Collateral, Public Enemies, The Last of the Mohicans and Miami Vice fame. However, he is more an action-drama / thriller director and it shows, to a degree, in this movie. Characters aren't developed very well but the action scenes (in this case, the fight scenes) are great.Part of the problem is that Mann tries to cram as many events from Ali's life into the movie as possible. Even though the movie is fairly long at 2 1/2 hours, many of the lesser events are given a passing mention, with no real context. You often feel no connection to the event and they just feel like flashes across the screen.A better way to tackle the subject would have been to concentrate on the big themes and events of Ali's life, and leave out all the miscellaneous life. This, or make a mini-series rather than a movie. The man did and achieved so much, 2 1/2 hours is hardly enough time to encapsulate his life.On the plus side, as mentioned before the fight scenes are great. Well staged, well shot and very tense.Will Smith got a Best Leading Actor Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Ali, but I am not sure he deserved it. Physically he is not imposing enough to be Ali. Furthermore, while he does a great job at capturing Ali's bravado and trash-talking, his verbal tone just doesn't seem right in normal speech. It's as if every line of dialogue is a speech, rather than just normal dialogue, and this can be quite irritating at times.Good supporting cast though. Jon Voight is almost unrecognizable as legendary sports presenter, and Ali's verbal sparring partner, Howard Cosell. He does a great job and got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his efforts.Good work too from Jamie Foxx. The hidden gem is Mykelti Williamson who gives a great, over-the-top, often-hilarious performance as boxing promoter Don King.Overall, considering the subject, this movie is disappointing but there is enough there to keep you interested.",6,2,3,4 February 2016
Source Code," Needs a Director's Cut...
","Good, but had the potential to be brilliant. Great central plot: sort of Ground Hog Day meets Charlie Kaufman (esp Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) meets Philip K Dick (esp Minority Report) meets Christopher Nolan (esp Memento and Inception). However, the clever central plot isn't enough to make a decent-length film out of, so there are some detours and padding (eg a romantic angle), and this detracts from the film. Then, just when I thought the movie had redeemed itself for all the padding by having a picture- perfect ending, that wasn't the ending. There is a final twist after the ending-that-should-have-been, and this is totally unnecessary.Duncan Jones (David Bowie's son) shows that Moon was no one-off: he is a director with a great future. He just needs more control over his movies - the tacked-on ending smacks of corporate interference.Great performance by Jake Gyllenhaal, and I am generally not a fan (though Donnie Darko and Jarhead were great). Good support from Michelle Monaghan and Vera Farmiga.If ever a movie needed a Director's Cut, this is it.",7,1,3,21 March 2014

Iron Man 3," Consistent with 1 & 2
","I enjoyed Iron Man and Iron Man 2. Despite the science fiction, cartoon hero nature of the movie, the plots were reasonably believable and not too ridiculous. Action scenes were good, but not overdone. Moreover, characters had depth - quite rare in action movies in general and especially so in superhero movies. Dialogue was snappy and funny. Performances were first-rate.Iron Man 3 is no exception. In fact, I enjoyed it slightly more than the previous two. Tony Stark showed a vulnerability that wasn't evident in the first two. Plus, in the Mandarin and Guy Pearce's character we have a villain who is a match for Iron Man.On this note, Guy Pearce put in a great performance as the bad guy. Usual great, snappy, witty performance from Robert Downey Jr. Great entertainment.",7,1,2,9 February 2014
Deepwater Horizon," More filler than drama
","In April 2010 the exploration oil rig Deepwater Horizon, stationed in the Gulf of Mexico, suffered a catastrophic disaster, exploding and being set on fire. This is the story of the lead-up to the disaster, the disaster itself and the individual actions involved, and the aftermath.More filler than drama - essentially a 40-50 minute short docudrama turned into a 107 minute movie. The remainder is just padding. Yes, I know, the idea is to engage you, the audience, by getting you to know and like the characters and thus empathize with them when disaster strikes, but here it doesn't really work. The lead-up here is dull, and the attempts at engagement overdone and overt. It also doesn't help that, having introduced you to all these characters, other than the main ones it is difficult to tell who is who when the tragedy unfolds.On that point, the action itself is difficult to follow. By trying to make things as realistic as possible, director Peter Berg also makes things more confusing, with dim/dark lighting and random, unexplained things happen. It becomes hard to tell which characters are involved or what the dangers are (other than the obvious ones, of course).While a tragedy, there's not enough detail and drama involved to make a complete movie, but it got made anyway.",4,4,7,5 July 2017
United 93," Intense, realistic and utterly compelling
","A dramatised account of United 93, one of the four flights hijacked on 9/11. We see the events of that fateful day unfold from several perspectives - the passengers, crew and hijackers of United 93, several air traffic controllers in a few major control centres and from the perspective of the military, in particular US air defence at NORAD.Intense, realistic and utterly compelling. Mixing dramatisations of actual events, eg the air traffic control scenes, with best guess estimates of what happened in United 93 we have a movie that is part-docu-drama, part-fiction (though probably quite close to the truth). This gives the movie a great grittiness.Very well set up too. The scenes of passengers and crew getting on the plane are like any flight. This makes the movie even more engaging, as it shows it the characters were just everyday people going about their everyday lives, until fate changed that.Even when action is called for, there's no gung ho, Bruce Willis-like heroics. It's all pretty realistic and engaging.The sense of realism and real people is helped by having a cast of largely unknowns. Many of the air traffic controllers and some of the USAF personnel are played by themselves. No Hollywood pretentiousness and glamour.And then there's the tension. Director Paul Greengrass builds the intensity well, and ends the movie at the height of it, i.e. perfectly.Even though you know how it is going to end, you can't look away for a second, it is that compelling.Superb movie.",9,0,0,12 November 2016

","A young boy is lured into a sewer by a clown and disappears. Months later and another child has disappeared. A group of children band together to figure out the mystery.Ok, ish. Better than your average horror movie, but that doesn't say much at all - the bar is set very low in that genre. For the most part the movie falls back on horror clichés and devices. However, it has a decent degree of engagement and intrigue, making it better than most. Does make for a hit-and-miss ride though - the interesting, engaging bits mixed in with the crappy cheap thrills and/or predictable action bits.",5,1,3,24 June 2018

Rick's world is thrown into turmoil when a former flame, Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), walks back into his life.As brilliant and as much a classic as it is made out to be. Great, engaging story.

","A sweet Disney movie. Mostly meant for children but has something for adults too. Adorable characters, nice story, happy ending.Not perfect though. The opening background and set up are wonderful. After that, however, the movie does feel like it loses some of its charm and substance as it then becomes a bit of a caper. Becomes more of a kid's movie the longer it goes on.Doesn't overstay its welcome though. Is just the right length.Animation is okay, for the time. Some of it feels a bit basic, but that might just be compared to the animation of today.Good voice work. Only recognisable name among the voice providers is Rod Taylor, making it even more impressive - it was a cast of mostly unknowns.",7,3,3,27 October 2014

Excellent use of dream / fantasy sequences as we look inside Barrie's mind.Great work by Johnny Depp in the lead role, a performance for which he got an Oscar nomination. Good support from Kate Wnslet as Sylvia and Julie Christie as her mother plus also Radha Mitchell and Dustin Hoffman.

A group of survivors is huddled together on a lifeboat. Soon they are joined by an unwelcome guest, a survivor from the U-Boat...Written by John Steinbeck (of Grapes of Wrath and Of Mice and Men fame) and directed by Alfred Hitchcock this has, on paper, the makings of a great examination of how humans act towards their fellow man, especially enemies, during times of war. The movie does go down that path, but is forced into clichéd, predictable outcomes due to when it was filmed.While the plot is interesting and there are some good twists, there is a great deal of anti-German propaganda present in this film. It was made in 1944, after all. The finished article thus hardly feels objective at all.Overall: interesting as a survival movie and war story, just a pity about the propaganda.",7,0,0,18 January 2016
Detroit," Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears
","1967. The police and black inhabitants of Detroit seem perpetually in a state of conflict, largely due to the police's biased, heavy-handed attitude towards African-Americans. This comes to a head when the police raid an unlicensed black club, causing the local residents to riot. The State Police and National Guard are called in and Detroit starts to resemble a war zone. On a fateful night, the local police round up some suspects at the Algiers Motel in connection with (what they believe is) sniper fire. The police handling of the situation soon gets out of hand.A thought-provoking drama, directed by Kathryn Bigelow (The Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty) and based on a true story. Shows quite well how police can abuse their power and not treat citizens equally, fairly or civilly. A great exposition of police brutality and racial prejudice (and, to a degree, injustice - more about that later).However, not perfect. The scenes inside the Algiers Motel are drawn out to the nth degree. The point of the scenes was made quite quickly and drawing it out just seemed like it was drawn out for the sake of it. It became rather cartoony after a while, especially the way the cops behaved.All the characters also seem so one-dimensional, either being 'good guys' or 'bad guys', rather than having some characters who are just going about their jobs and lives. Some of this seems to be Bigelow trying to balance the actions of some individuals with those of others within the same group, as is to say, 'Hey, they're not all like that'. For example, after escaping the Algiers Motel a black man is confronted by a police officer who turns out to be helpful and nice - too nice.With less time spent on the incident and more on the court case we could have had an incredibly powerful drama on injustice (in addition to covering the themes of racial prejudice and police brutality). Instead the injustice seems like an after-thought, with the police brutality the main focus. It would also have made for a better-paced movie - instead of the slow-fast-slowish we ended with.",7,0,2,20 December 2018

After they steal his car and kill his dog, he goes on a revenge-fueled killing spree...Started fairly well - good build up and backstory. After a while, however, it loses any pretence of character-development, plot- development or intrigue and just becomes a simple action movie. This is unfortunate, as it had some potential in the crime-drama stakes. Even worse, it is action of the perfectly choreographed, first person shooter, high body count, explosions-for-the-sake-of- explosions variety. It got rather monotonous and predictable after a while.Ends up a tad boring, and disappointing. A bit more plot development, and less mindless action, and this could have been a good movie.",5,7,11,3 September 2015
Chinatown," Stylish and intriguing
","Stylish and intriguing.Los Angeles in the early-1930s. A private detective, JJ Gittes (played by Jack Nicholson), is hired by a woman to investigate her husband, as she suspects he is having an affair. Her husband, Hollis Mulwray, is the chief water engineer for the city of Los Angeles. Soon after Gittes delivers the photos that seem to confirm her suspicions, he meets the real wife of the man. Intrigued, Gittes investigates further. Then Mr Mulwray turns up dead...A clever, slow-burning thriller from director Roman Polanski. Information is gained slowly, heightening the intrigue. Many red herrings, and detours. Nothing is obvious. To make things even more complex, there's not just one plot line in play...Very film noir like in its feel. You could easily see Humphrey Bogart as Gittes...Good work by Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway in the leading roles. Good support from John Huston.Not perfect though. The movie loses momentum in the last third or so, focusing on a lesser plot and amplifying the detour by an extended wild goosechase. Ultimately this sub-plot is necessary, to an extent, but it needn't have had so much time devoted to it. Just when the movie was ready to kick up a gear, having idled along previously, it went sideways rather than forward.",8,2,3,8 February 2016
Rocketman," Bland
","The life of music legend Elton John.Underwhelming. I did not set my expectations very high and even then was disappointed. When this was released I figured it was an attempt to cash in on the success of Bohemian Rhapsody and make a biopic about a 1970s rock star. This despite growing up in the 70s and liking the music of Elton John. I thought Bohemian Rhapsody was excellent but just from the trailers Rocketman didn't seem to have anywhere near the same energy, profundity and solid storytelling.And the trailer was pretty much spot-on. Rocketman is a linear telling of Elton John's life...and that's it. Director Dexter Fletcher turns it into a semi-musical but that just makes it worse. Like most musicals, song-and-dance numbers being jammed into the middle of a scene makes for jarring, clumsy storytelling and this is no different. It might have been okay if they had used the original music but instead we have actor Taron Edgerton singing the songs, and he just doesn't sound right.There's never any spark that makes the movie interesting, Some scenes are downright clumsy: the scene that runs through the movie of John at an AA meeting seems pretty implausible and contrived and merely there as a means for John to tell his life story.On the positive side, performances are very good. Despite his singing, Edgerton is great as Elton John and Jamie Bell puts in a solid performance as Bernie Taupin.",5,4,6,6 March 2020
A Star Is Born," Disappointing
","A famous rock star, Jack Maine, spots an amateur singer, Ally, singing in a bar. He is impressed and invites her to sing with him in one of his concerts. Soon the relationship between them grows stronger. In addition, her star begins to rise, while his sets.I have watched the 1954 Judy Garland version of A Star Is Born and wasn't impressed with that. Was massively padded, largely by unnecessary musical numbers which ruined the momentum of the movie.This, the 2018 version, fortunately keeps the musical interludes largely short and necessary. However, it's still not great.After a fairly clumsy start the movie shows a large amount of potential: as a commentary on the superficiality of modern music, as an engaging passing-of-the-torch story or simply as a struggling-artist-claws-her-way-to-the-top story. Unfortunately, none of these themes are developed or go anywhere profound. In fact, instead of ridiculing the superficiality of modern music, the film ultimately glorifies it. The two main characters ultimately represent how rock 'n roll is a dying art form, being replaced by incredibly shallow pop music.No, the movie is, unfortunately, just a romantic drama, and a fairly conventional one too. The music industry setting just provides the backdrop. Character engagement is fairly limited, as the way the story is told is more about plot than character development. The unrelatable (music industry / celebrity world) setting probably doesn't help either.",5,2,3,4 August 2019

Ending feels a bit trite.Good performances by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney.

Lone Survivor," OK, but not great
","(Spoilers)OK, but not great, modern war story. The band of brothers aspect was good but a touch overdone, and is nothing new. Plus, the first few scenes of the movie seem full of empty sentimentality. The first half of the movie, is on the surface, about heroism and camaraderie. However, more than this, it is about military incompetence. The overly complex mission, so complex any small detail, eg loss of communications, can derail it. The failure to terminate a major threat to the mission. The hung-ho, uncoordinated rescue attempt.The first half was actually somewhat irritating, as it seemed to value heroism over good planning and prudent decision-making.This is redeemed somewhat by the second half. Here it is a movie about survival, grace, generosity and kindness.Powerful ending.Decent performances all round, though nobody stands out.",6,0,2,24 February 2014
To Be or Not to Be," Lightly entertaining
","German-occupied Warsaw, WW2. A band of actors, headed by husband-and-wife superstars of Polish theatre, set out to prevent a German spy from revealing key members of the Polish underground and families of Polish airmen fighting in Britain.Lightly entertaining. Is a comedy-drama but doesn't entirely succeed in either area. More weighted to comedy, the comedy is largely farce, with the usual sequence of problem arises - much consternation and mad scramble for a solution - gets fixed by something that causes another problem - rinse and repeat. There are some good, even great, comedic moments but they are few and far between as the movie largely trades in cheapish gags.While predominantly a comedy, the movie had potential as a drama. There's the intrigue re the spy, the plight of the Poles in Warsaw, the general examination of war and its consequences. However, with the emphasis on comedy, these sub-plots and themes largely take a back seat. There's also a romantic angle, which just cheapens the drama.Overall, entertaining and not a bad way to spend 100 minutes, but not brilliant.",6,1,1,14 February 2020
The Death of Stalin," Funny, but tonally muddled and jarring
","Moscow, 1953. After being in power for nearly 30 years, Soviet dictator Josef Stalin takes ill and quickly dies. Now the members of the Council of Ministers scramble for power. At the forefront of the machinations is NKVD chief Lavrenti Beria, after Stalin the most feared man in the USSR. Council member Nikita Khrushchev does his best to maintain order and thwart Beria's plans.Written and directed by Armando Iannucci, who gave us the brilliant political satires 'The Thick of It', 'In the Loop' and 'Veep' this movie has Iannucci's trademark political intrigue combined with satirical humour. Very funny at times.However, while the drama and the comedy of his previous efforts meshed perfectly together, largely because the comedy was making fun of the drama, here it doesn't work well. The drama - mass executions, torture, a callous disregard for life - is at odds with the comedy. It becomes difficult to laugh at the antics of the Russian ministers when just a second previously you saw someone executed at their whim. It would have worked better as a straight drama, showing the fall-out of Stalin's death. Making this a straight comedy would have been impossible.Overall: watchable, for the comedy moments.",6,1,2,7 October 2018
Se7en," Brilliant
","Two police detectives - one, Somerset, about to retire and the other, Mills, just transferred into the precinct - investigate the murder of an obese man. On his wall was written the word 'Gluttony'. Then they are alerted to the murder of a lawyer. On his floor was written the word 'Greed'. Somerset suspects that the murders were the work of the same man, a man murdering people who have committed the seven deadly sins.Brilliant. Starts off as an intriguing, clever detective drama, showing how police go about investigating crimes, developing the characters and meticulously developing the plot. Highly engaging and enthralling. From a point it becomes more than a crime drama, developing some deeper undertones and ending as a dark psychological drama.Superb ending with a very unpredictable twist. Ties the whole story together perfectly.Solid performances from Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt in the lead roles. The standout performance, however, goes to Kevin Spacey who is chillingly good in his role. Reminded me a lot of his performance in The Usual Suspects.Great work by David Fincher, directing only his second feature film (the first was Aliens 3). This movie made his career and created his signature of clever psychological dramas with a twist. Four years, and two movies, later he would surpass even the brilliance of Se7en with one of the greatest movies of all time - Fight Club.",10,0,0,9 December 2017
I'm Not There," Being a Dylan fan does not necessarily help...
","Clearly I needed to be high on something, or be french, to appreciate this. Pretentious, boring nonsense of the highest order.Some people have commented that they could not follow this as they don't know much about Bob Dylan. I am a huge fan of Bob Dylan and know a lot about his history, but even I could not follow the plot (assuming there was one). Clearly inside knowledge doesn't help.The only thing keeping this from getting the lowest possible rating is the soundtrack, which features actual Bob Dylan songs, not covers. The sad thing about that is that Bob Dylan must have endorsed this movie, otherwise he would not have allowed his recordings to be used.The fact that the movie is directed by Todd Haynes is a tip-off that it is craptacular. He directed Velvet Goldmine, another movie whose subject had heaps of potential but ended up being a pile of pretentious, boring excrement.",2,7,9,22 July 2015
Wayne's World," Hilarious and cool
","Hilarious and cool.Wayne (played by Mike Myers) and his friend Garth (Dana Carvey) have their own program on public access television, broadcast from the basement of Wayne's parents' house. It is pretty low-key and has a limited audience. However, they are spotted by an unscrupulous, superficial and manipulative TV producer, Benjamin (Rob Lowe), who aims to turn them more mainstream and exploit the advertising and sponsorship potential of the show Based on the characters Mike Myers and Dana Carvey played on Saturday Night Live, Wayne's World is very funny and original. Some great dialogue and one-liners and contemporary (for the early/mid- 90s) humour. Some fairly clever send-ups of popular culture too. Captures well the zeitgeist of the early/mid-90s, including the music – the soundtrack is excellent.Only downside is that it hasn't aged too well, and the in-humour of the mid-90s doesn't transfer very well to 20+ years later. It did feel a bit less fresh in 2016 as opposed to 1992. Still a great movie though.",9,0,0,23 January 2016

Dialogue is insanely original, fresh and simply wonderful.The performances are spot-on. I can't imagine anyone other than Jeff Bridges playing The Dude. John Goodman and Steve Buscemi are perfect as his sidekicks. Even the minor parts are played brilliantly. John Turturro, as Jesus, deserved way more screen time.

Unbreakable," Good, but...
","Mixed feelings about this one. It veers randomly between brilliance and lameness. On the plus side, it has the usual M Night Shymalan unexpected twists and smooth eeriness. Bruce Willis gives an excellent performance and Samuel L Jackson does the only thing he knows, cold intensity, and does it well. On the negative side there were too many meaningless tangents, plot holes and cringingly lame scenes.Entertaining, reasonably good, but, especially when you consider that this was M Night Shymalan's follow-up to the brilliant The Sixth Sense, disappointing.",7,0,0,30 May 2014
Fury," Good, but not great - quite clumsy at times
","Good, but not great, WW2 movie. Written and directed by David Ayer, who gave us the brilliant End of Watch, plus the reasonably good Harsh Times, and wrote Training Day, you expect good plot, good action and, most of all, character depth. The action scenes are great - pretty much straight out of the Steven Spielberg/Saving Private Ryan/Band of Brothers school of realistic war action. Suitably gory, yet not gratuitously so.Plot is OK, but not brilliant. Some sub-plots feel contrived and the final scenes seem overly gung ho, sentimental...and very predictable and unoriginal. Furthermore, some scenes are very clumsily done, and/or plain unnecessary. (The tank's Commander and Assistant Driver in the women's apartment was the best example of this - has me squirming the whole time and it seemed to last forever).Moreover, the character depth Ayer built up in End of Watch is lacking here. Yes, there is some character depth, but it seems superficial. In End of Watch you ended up caring so much for both cops and couldn't imagine anything happening to them. In Fury you hardly get to know them - only the tank commander and assistant driver and then only to a limited extent. Makes you feel less engaged with regard to what happens to them.In keeping with the lack of dimension to the characters, the performances feel a bit wooden. Brad Pitt is OK in the lead role, but his performance lacked something. Similarly, Shia LaBeouf is OK, but his character is overly stereotyped. Logan Lerman probably gives the most convincing performance of the movie, as the rookie Assistant Driver.Overall, an exciting and entertaining movie. If more time was spent getting us to care about the characters, and less time on unnecessary, clumsy scenes, this would have been a brilliant movie.",7,6,13,23 October 2014
Fight Club," Superb
","Superb, and truly one of the greatest movies of all time.It starts with the screenplay. Adapted from, and very faithful to, an excellent book. The book by Chuck Palahniuk was perfect for a movie: vivid, powerful, challenging, original, unpredictable. Considering how perfectly formed the book already was, the screenplay would have been a doddle.Some very interesting themes are explored - consumerism, class warfare, multiple-personality disorder, male bonding, terrorism and anarchy - without being judgemental. Direction is spot-on. Perfect cinematography, pacing and editing. The twists and nuances of the book are captured perfectly.Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are perfectly cast as the two lead characters, and deliver in spades. Helena Bonham Carter is a strange selection to take on the role of Marla, as she tends to act in Shakespearean dramas and other period pieces. However, despite this, her performance is very convincing.An absolute classic.",10,64,76,19 April 2014
Akira," Not sure what all the fuss is about
","2019. 31 years after being destroyed during World War 3, Tokyo (now 'Neo-Tokyo') has been rebuilt and is a thriving metropolis. Shotaro Kaneda is the leader of a biker gang. His friend Tetsuo is injured in an accident and taken to a top-secret government facility. He develops telekinetic powers but decides to use them for evil rather than good. He has the same powers as Akira, the force that destroyed Tokyo in 1988, and now it appears that history will repeat itself.Regarded as some sort of animation-drama masterpiece but it is far from that. The animation is great but the remainder is average, at best. The plot has potential but becomes quite random quite quickly. Stuff happens that seems tangential to the story. Plus, there's several strands of plots going on at the same time, adding to the complexity but detracting from the focus of the story and the engagement level.The random, rambling, plot becomes quite tedious past a point.However, the plot is not the worst if it: character engagement is where the movie falls flat. There's really nobody to like or care about. Characters are one-dimensional and appear to be constructed to appeal to kids.Ultimately, it's mediocre.",5,4,5,8 February 2020
Citizen Kane," Every bit the masterpiece
","Charles Foster Kane (played by Orson Welles), media mogul, dies at his isolated palatial estate, Xanadu. A virtual recluse, his only company was his large retinue of servants and his collection of priceless artifacts. A news outlet sets out to reveal the man behind the legend, going through articles and books on Kane, interviewing his friends, associates and ex-wife. They see his rise to power and fortune, his marriages, his attempts at politics. Moreover, they are striving to discover the meaning of his dying utterance - Rosebud. A masterpiece in every way. Superb plot, written by Orson Welles and Herman J Mankiewicz. Covers some very powerful themes, all of which are still relevant today: the corruption of innocence and ideals by power, wealth and greed; the power, manipulation and deceitfulness of the media, the yearning for simpler times and how earthly fortunes mean nothing in the end.Brilliant direction by Welles - this movie set a new benchmark in the field and even today would be difficult to surpass. His camera work and cinematography are exquisite: the use of light and dark (especially), the camera angles, panning shots. Just watching it you know you are watching a master craftsman at work - every shot is carefully planned and deliberately aimed to create a certain effect. It feels like art.Solid performances all round, with Welles to the fore again. Even the makeup is in another league - witness the transformations of Kane from 25 years old to 30-something, to 50-something all the way to his final days at 70-something.Probably the biggest travesty in all of cinema is that Citizen Kane did not win the 1942 Best Picture Oscar. It was nominated in nine categories, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Leading Actor and Best Original Screenplay, but only one won Oscar - Best Original Screenplay. Best Picture went to How Green Was My Valley, a good movie but not in Citizen Kane's league.The reason for this may well have been a campaign by media tycoon William Randolph Hearst to discredit the movie and prevent it from being released. The movie was loosely based on the life of Hearst.",10,3,4,16 May 2016
Darkest Hour," Superb, with an outstanding performance from Gary Oldman
","May, 1940. Germany has invaded Belgium and Holland and poised to invade France. UK Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain resigns and Winston Churchill assumes the role of Prime Minister. Churchill was an outsider for the role and many of his colleagues have misgivings about his abilities. Even the King has issues with Churchill. From the outset Churchill is opposed to any negotiation with Germany but as the situation in France worsens, certain members of his cabinet think that suing for peace may the best course of action. This not only troubles him deeply but puts his position in jeopardy. Superb docu-drama. Edifying, capturing the situation of the war well and how perilous England's situation was at the time. The issues Churchill inherited and the problems he faced are explored well.Good plot development, and quite accurate, historically. There are a few dramatic devices thrown in to help the story along. These generally don't tamper with the bigger picture though do feel a bit manipulative on occasion. Quite an emotional and stirring conclusion.Superb performance by Gary Oldman as Churchill. Virtually unrecognisable - the film's make-up department did an amazing job - Oldman captures Churchill's mannerisms perfectly. Churchill appears as a multi-dimensional character - strong but vulnerable, strong-willed but with moments of indecision, hero and anti-hero - and this is largely thanks to Oldman's deft handling of the role. Gary Oldman won the 2018 Best Actor Oscar for his performance - the first Oscar of his career - and truly deserved it.Also deserving of their Oscar was the film's makeup team which won Best Achievement in Makeup and Hairstyling.Good supporting performances from a cast that includes Kristin Scott Thomas (as Clementine Churchill), Lily James, Stephen Dillane (as Viscount Halifax) and Ben Mendelsohn (as King George VI).",9,0,3,25 April 2018
The Birth of a Nation," Controversial & divisive
","Probably the most controversial and divisive movie ever made. For its time (1915), its cinematography is superb. Even today some of the battle scenes are great. Orson Welles once listed DW Griffith as one of the greatest directors who had ever lived, and did so mostly for his innovative cinematography. Considering that Orson Welles IS one of the greatest directors who has ever lived, that's quite a compliment.For the first half of the movie, DW Griffith stuck to history (except for the fictional families at the centre of the drama) and this had the makings of a great epic.Then Griffith turned the movie into a racist, revisionist piece of pro- Ku Klux Klan propaganda. The latter half of the movie could easily have been a Nazi Germany propaganda movie from the 1930s or 40s, it was that bad.Sad, that anyone could make such utter racist bs and especially considering the objectivity and solid storyline of the first half.7-8/10 for the first half and the innovativeness of the cinematography. 0/10 for the second half.Definitely worth a watch. Worth seeing as a piece of cinema history, and to see what all the fuss is about.",4,0,0,16 April 2014
The Maze Runner," Yet another made-for-kids drama...
","Yet another made-for-kids drama...Boy wakes up and finds himself in a 'tribe' of boys, locked behind high walls. Only way out is through a huge maze which is guarded by giant spiders. Before even thinking of escaping, there is an internal power struggle to deal with...The movie has a mildly interesting plot setup - the maze - but beyond that it is fairly dull, derivative and dumbed down for kids. Pretty much Lord of the Flies meets Starship Troopers, though far less gritty. Basic plot, conventional direction. Has its moments of genuine intrigue and tension, but those are few and far between.Only surprising thing about this movie is that it doesn't star Shailene Woodley and/or Miles Teller...Then, worst of all, it doesn't really end - the whole thing is set- up for sequel. So pretty much the same prolonged, anything-to- deprive-clueless-teens-of-their-dollars bs as with The Hunger Games. On that note, that's about the best thing I can say about this movie - at least it's better than The Hunger Games, though it doesn't take much. Shorter movie, and less Disney-like. Also not a blatant rip- off of Battle Royale...",5,0,0,28 July 2015
Memento," Mind-bogglingly, breath-takingly brilliant - insanely original and intelligent
","Mind-bogglingly, breath-takingly brilliant - insanely original and intelligent.A man, Leonard Shelby (played by Guy Pearce) has just shot and killed another man. Why did he do it? Through scenes shown in reverse order (with individual scenes separated by another set of scenes shown in forward order), we unravel the mystery.Christopher Nolan's second movie. His first, Following, was great and showed his penchant for clever, original plots. Here he exceeded himself - Memento is probably the cleverest, most original movie you'll ever see.The reverse order thing is a brilliant concept in itself, and as far as I know the only other movie to try it was Irreversible by Gaspar Noe (released after Memento, so Memento did it first). Irreversible was much more simple in its method - just play the scenes in reverse order. However, with Memento, Nolan goes one step further. By having intermittent forward-moving scenes he helps add backstory. These eventually meet the backward-moving scenes, closing the continuity loop and making for a seamless, continuous story. Furthermore, it is not the reverse order of the scenes alone that make this movie brilliant. Reverse order scenes without a solid plot behind them would just be a gimmick, and this is certainly no gimmicky movie. The plot itself is brilliant, and ultimately explains why we have to see the scenes backwards.Moreover, despite the enormous complexity of writing and staging such a concept, in the end everything fits and makes sense. Nolan also leaves just enough ambiguity and mystery behind so you can fill in your own theories and backstories.This movie deserves every superlative a movie can get.",10,1,3,31 January 2016
Inglourious Basterds," Great, unorthodox, WW2 movie
","Tarantino's back, and it was worth the wait. Great WW2 movie, though very unorthodox. From rewriting history to the use of David Bowie's 'Cat People' (one of my favourite songs, by the way) in a scene, there is nothing conventional or reverent about this movie, but Tarantino makes it work.Great action, and great plot. Does drag at times, as Tarantino sketches the background and builds the suspense. ('Jackie Brown' had that problem too). The use of French and German, and not just English, plus subtitles both adds and detracts from the movie. Many of the scenes rely on French or German being spoken, so there's the plus. The minus is that it stunts the usual witty and swagger-filled dialogue that is Tarantino's trademark. Reading the subtitles isn't the same as hearing it in English. Plus, while you're reading the subtitles, you're missing some of the action.Though Brad Pitt is billed as the lead actor, the star of the show, for my mind, is Christoph Waltz as the cunning and sadistic SS Colonel. Superb acting on his part. Brad Pitt, Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger are also very good. Eli Roth was unconvincing, though.Overall, not as good as Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs (though nothing is) or either Kill Bill, but very entertaining and certainly worth watching.",9,0,0,13 October 2014
Amistad," Great, powerful movie
","Great, powerful movie. Based on a true story, it demonstrates the barbarity of the slave trade in the 1800s, and the depths of human nature. Solid script. Great direction by Steven Spielberg.The cast don't put a foot wrong. Anthony Hopkins is superb as John Quincy Adams, and deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. His speech toward the end is worth the cost of admission alone. Matthew McConaughey reminds us that, before his performances consisted entirely of him showing off his abs, he was actually a bloody good actor (A Time to Kill, released one year earlier, also demonstrates this). Djimon Hounsou, Morgan Freeman and Nigel Hawthorne all put in great performances.Worth watching for every possible reason - as a documentary, as a human drama, for the performances.",9,0,4,13 March 2016
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Formulaic plot but reasonably entertaining
","Set immediately before Episode 4, Jyn Erso is the daughter of Galen Erso, a senior scientist for The Empire. They have not seen each other in 15 years. Due to her father's position, Jyn is liberated from Empire imprisonment by the Rebel Alliance. Word has come to them that he is helping build a weapon that tilt the balance of power firmly in favour of The Empire - the Death Star. Reluctantly, Jyn is drawn into the struggle.Pretty formulaic but reasonably interesting. Set up is pretty basic and plot feels implausible and contrived at times, plus the characters are not that engaging. Character depth, engagement and soundness of plot are not what this movie is about. Action scenes, adventure and CGI are, and here it does pretty well. Quite exciting, with a momentum that keeps you watching. Does degenerate into fairly predictable fight scenes and plot development towards the end though.Overall: okay, and on par with Episodes 4-6. Certainly better than Episodes 1-3, though this is an easy feat.",6,1,4,14 October 2017
Shakespeare in Love," Funny, clever comedy
","William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes), pre-fame, is a struggling writer searching for inspiration. He finds it in the beautiful Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow). They quickly fall in love, but there are complications...Funny, clever comedy. Some great lines and skits plus the writers cleverly weave the actual history of Shakespeare and his works into the plot. Makes for a highly engaging, intellectually stimulating and entertaining movie. Also has a lightness and freshness to it that carries the movie along wonderfully.Won the 1999 Best Picture Oscar, beating out four brilliant movies - Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, Elizabeth and Life is Beautiful.",8,1,1,4 February 2017
This Is the End," Novel idea badly executed
","Novel idea badly executed. The idea of bringing as many Hollywood (and other) celebrities together in one movie, all playing themselves, often parodying themselves, was a great one. However that's about the only good thing about the movie.Plot is poor, and not very original. The longer the movie goes on, the sillier it becomes. Yes, it is meant to be a comedy, but it's not that funny. Many of the 'jokes' are quite juvenile.Where the movie does have sparks of entertainment is when the original plan is adhered to, ie stars making fun of themselves. Any scene with Michael Cera was great, because of this.Such scenes are few and far between, however, and often, instead of running each other down, many of the scenes just involve mutual back- slapping. Nothing personified this more than just about anything James Franco said in the movie. Also reminded me what a vastly overrated actor he is...Talking performances, Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill and Chris Robinson are okay, with Robinson being the pick of the bunch. As alluded to previously, James Franco is irritating, as always.A wasted opportunity.",3,3,7,30 March 2014

Alien: Resurrection," An unnecessary, predictable movie
","An unnecessary, predictable movie.Ripley's back, believe it or not. Killed in Aliens 3, but back, as a clone. Not to save the universe, but to enhance the producers' income statements. The franchise was done by Alien 3, yet they made this. Very predictable, this has absolutely nothing to offer. Performance-wise, nothing to write home about. even Signourney Weaver seemed to be going through the motions. Winona Ryder was unsuited to her role. She is best at dramas, not action movies, and taking on roles that require talent. This movie certainly didn't require any acting talent.",3,0,2,17 June 2015
World War Z," Generic zombie movie, with A-grade production and star
","Generic zombie movie, with A-grade production and star. Zombie movies have always been a B-grade type of movie. The cheap production values fitted well with the apocalyptic horror of the genre. Add to this the fact that every zombie drama has pretty much the same main plot, and it's a recipe for easily making hundreds of movies which are fairly indistinguishable from each other.The only innovations in zombie movies have come in zombie-comedies, which are often parodies of zombie dramas. Zombieland and Shaun of the Dead are the best examples of these. Warm Bodies was probably the most original zombie movie since the first one, as it took a very different tact. Plus, it was half-comedy.Plot-wise, World War Z isn't anything new. Where WWZ is different is that it has A-grade production values and a mega-name star. Take those away and it could be just another zombie movie.This said, the special effects and other big-budget features do help. The scale of the movie is huge, and makes the production seem so real. Makes you think that what happens in WWZ could well happen in real life.Performance-wise, Brad Pitt does his usual action-hero plus caring- family-man routine, and does it well. His appearance must have used up almost the entire acting budget, as there are no other big names in the movie (unless you are a fan of The Thick of It: good to see Peter Capaldi land a Hollywood role). David Morse, Matthew Fox and Moritz Bleibtrau have minor roles.Reasonably entertaining, but nothing special.",6,0,2,28 May 2014
Passengers," Original, engaging sci-fi drama
","The spaceship Avalon is on a 120-year voyage to colonise the planet Homestead II. On board are 258 crew and 5,000 passengers, the first inhabitants of the planet. They will be in hibernation for nearly all of the 120 years. However, after only 30 years, one of the passengers, Jim Preston, is awoken from his hibernation. Try as he might, he cannot re-hibernate himself. He resigns himself to not living to see the end of the voyage. Out of loneliness, he thinks of de-hibernating one of the female passengers...Very good, and surprisingly so. Based on the trailers it looked like a basic, B-grade sci fi-adventure movie. However, it is far better than that. Highly original plot that is also quite plausible. The physics of the events, actions and sub-plots seems reasonably sound (though I'm no astrophysicist). No jarring moments where you think 'That's not right...'Quite engaging too. The whole stranded-in-space central plot is intriguing and explores some very interesting themes.Some good adventure and a touch of romance, plus a fairly emotional ending, make for a great movie.",8,1,2,21 October 2017

The Hunger Games," Watch Battle Royale instead
","Vastly over-rated movie - I really don't know what all the fuss was about. Clearly meant for teenagers: trite romance; contrived, hole- filled plot; Disney-style happy ending. (Though at 2 1/2 hours it is way too long for teenagers' concentration spans). However, as far as teen- oriented movies go, it is still better than Twilight, though that doesn't say much.Take out most of the first hour or so, as this was all just padding and didn't develop the characters or plot much; give it a more realistic, gritty feel and take out the Disney romance, sentimentality and ending and this could have been a decent movie. In its current form it is boring and crap.If you want a good, gritty, Last Person Standing / Survival of the Fittest -type movie, watch Battle Royale instead.",3,23,31,4 March 2014
Zootopia," Sweet, engaging and wonderfully original with a great message
","Judy Hopps is a young rabbit with dreams of one day becoming a police officer. No rabbit has ever been a police officer, but Judy perseveres and succeeds. Now she is off to Zootopia, a multi-animal society where all animals, predator and prey, live in harmony. Her euphoria and idealism is short-lived, however, as she discovers that prejudice between species still exists, and she even starts to doubt her anti-stereotyping stance. What's more, she's assigned to parking meter duty...Wonderfully original. The idea of animals harmoniously coexisting in one world, and essentially representing characters that humans would usually take, on has been done (Jungle Book, Robin Hood) but not to this extent. Some great little in-jokes and use of the different characteristics of the different animals.Nice story too, with some very engaging plots and characters. Some clever pop-cultural references too (eg The Godfather, Breaking Bad).Behind it all is a great anti-prejudice, anti-racism message which is conveyed very effectively. Maybe a little too effectively in that it is laid on a bit thick and comes across as preachy. A bit more subtlety was in order, though, for kids, the target demographic of the movie, the level was probably about right.Voice casting is spot on, with a host of stars contributing: Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, Tommy Chong (as a stoner, of course!), JK Simmons, Octavia Spencer, Alan Tudyk, Shakira, Bonnie Hunt.",8,5,10,19 November 2016

However, things don't go exactly according to plan...Very clever sci fi drama, directed by Terry Gilliam (of Monty Python fame and director of Brazil, Time Bandits and The Fisher King, among others). Ingenious, interesting plot which is quite watertight, which is quite a feat considering the complexity of it.Solid performance by Bruce Willis in the lead role. Good support from Madeleine Stowe.

Malle tells the story well, with a good set up, character depth and engagement and a very powerful ending. Quite evocative and poignant.Not perfect though. It took a while for the story to progress: Act 1 takes up about 50% of the film. Even after that the story progresses quite slowly.

Special effects are particularly good, especially those of the tsunami and of the people in it.However, is quite padded, especially towards the end. The director just seemed intent on drawing the movie out and it ends up a few scenes too long.

Yes, some of it is manipulative, but that is good, in this case. You only realise the importance of a gesture or event once it tugs at your heartstrings. Only negative is that maybe it was a bit too join-the-dots. However, it was never dull. Apparently it is very accurate, historically, too.Excellent performance by Chadwick Boseman in the lead role. Stand-out performance, however, goes to Harrison Ford as the curmudgeonly-but- with-a-heart-of-gold Branch Rickey.

Rocky V," Had heaps of potential, but squanders it all.
","Had heaps of potential, but squanders it all.The first Rocky is one of the most overrated movies of all time.

This time, however, the human drama side is more realistic and engaging and the movie flows better for it. Still not great, as it all feels kind of predictable, but it is less dull than the first movie.Rocky III was even more of the same - the template has been created and was there to be used/abused.Rocky IV used the same formula, but was just plain silly.Rocky V had the potential to be the best of the lot. It completes the life cycle of a boxer: small-time boxer to champion to defending title to has-been and retiring to be a trainer. It also showed the potential appearance of a new champion and a new Rocky, in a fighter the trainer/ex-champion coaches - the torch has been passed. It also covered the long-term effects of boxing, so shows the pluses and minuses of the sport.However, this is all for nothing. The plot ultimately degenerates into the usual Rocky vs nemesis fight at the end, with no lessons learned, and no point. It is a massive waste of opportunities.",4,0,1,12 April 2015

Sure, there have been many far worse Best Picture Oscar winners (Cimarron, Braveheart, Titanic and The English Patient spring immediately to mind), but in a year which gave us such great movies as Django Unchained, Life of Pi and, especially, Zero Dark Thirty, Argo gets it?

Star Trek Into Darkness," Fantastic CGI, nonsensical plot, irritating characters
","Fantastic CGI, nonsensical plot, irritating characters. From the outset, I didn't find the movie that great. This was due to the irritating characters. Didn't like Captain Kirk (or at least Chris Pine's maverick portrayal of him) in the first movie, and that didn't change here. Scotty was just so clichéd, and the constant whining in a fake Scottish accent was annoying. Doctor McCoy was the worst of the lot: even more whiny than Scotty, and everything he said was so cheesy. Every line of Dr McCoy's dialogue had me rolling my eyes.Didn't mind Spock, Sulu or Chekov though.Initially, it looked like the plot might pull the movie through. Was intriguing. However, from a point, it takes a bizarre and nonsensical turn. Kirk basically sides with a terrorist against his own fleet. Its as if JJ Abrams was trying to make a political statement, and a very misguided one.After that the plot is pretty random, and the movie never recovers.CGI is great, of course.No standout performances, in keeping with the annoying characters.",5,1,2,5 April 2014

The plot is not entirely plausible, and dialogue was often quite preachy. So preachy at times I thought the courts could use the movie in their instructional and 'inspiration' videos on the jury system!Good acting, mostly, though some of the actors playing the minor characters irritated me, by soapboxing.The movie did bring back some memories. I once served on a murder trial jury (one involving a knife, coincidentally), so I found some of the parallels quite intriguing.",7,0,1,8 March 2016

Meanwhile, in a nearby village a beautiful girl, Belle, is being harassed by the local casanova, Gaston. Then one day her father is imprisoned by the Beast...Sweet movie, though dull in spells. Part of the problem is that you know how it is going to end. There is some originality though - the animated pots, candlesticks etc - and these generally provide the most entertaining moments.Unfortunately, it is a musical. No particularly good songs: some are okay, some are quite forgettable and some are even a bit irritating.

Ending is also a bit trite and unprofound, despite seeming to be heading for something big.Great performances all round.

However, it pretty quickly fell back on standard horror formulae, and ended in a random, chaotic, confusing, pointless mess.Good performance by Essie Davis in the lead role. Noah Wiseman makes for a very irritating kid, though that might be the director and script's fault.

Us," Intriguing, action-filled horror-thriller
","A family on vacation is confronted outside their home by a family who look identical to them.Written and directed by Jordan Peele, of Key and Peele fame, Us follows in the same vein as Peele's previous movie, his debut offering 'Get Out': a reasonably clever and engaging horror movie. He's now carving out a for himself in horror, which is a far cry from his comedy roots.Us doesn't have the same coherent social messaging that Get Out had, but makes up for this with a compelling-viewing horror-thriller plot. It takes a while to get going, but once it does it is an action-packed roller-coaster ride.Does falter towards the end though. Some plot developments are nonsensical and inconsistent with what came before and the ultimate revelation is pretty tame. Conclusion is also quite weak. A pity, as the first 70-80% was great.Overall, worth a watch, just set your expectations for the ending quite low.",7,3,5,8 December 2019
The Danish Girl," Highly topical and reasonably interesting
","Copenhagen, Denmark, 1926. Einar Wegener (played by Eddie Redmayne) and his wife Gerda (Alicia Vikander) are a happily married couple. Both are artists, he preferring landscapes and she portraits. One day he poses for a portrait of hers while dressed as a woman. This is initially done as a lark, as is his later attendance at a party dressed as a woman. However, Einar soon discovers that he enjoys dressing as a woman and over time prefers being Lili, the female version of himself, to Einar. At first he an Gerda try to have his situation 'cured' but this leads nowhere (other than to many doctors trying to have him locked up as a pervert and/or lunatic). His voyage of self-discovery will ultimately lead to him undergoing the first ever sex-change operation.Very well timed, in terms of when this movie was made. Transgender rights are a controversial current topic and this movie covers the subject well. Sensitively made, it shows how people like Einar Wegener were treated by the medical profession and society in general, and thus how revolutionary, yet inevitable, his decision was. For these reasons, quite interesting from an historic and social perspective.Does take a while to get going though. The first 75% or so is quite slow-moving and feels like preamble (which it is, ultimately). Once he first undergoes the treatment, then it gets quite interesting. We see the impact on his relationships and on his/her outlook on life. The last 25% or so makes the film worth watching.Can't fault the cast at all. I can't imagine anyone other than Eddie Redmayne playing the role of Einar Wegener/Lili - well cast and he is incredibly convincing. Well deserved his Best Actor Oscar nomination.Alicia Vikander shines as Gerda and deserved her Best Supporting Actress Oscar. Even Amber Heard, who I thought may be out of her element in a serious drama, does well in her role.",7,0,1,11 June 2016
Elizabeth," Superb
","The ascension to the throne of England of Queen Elizabeth I and the aftermath. Shows the against-the-odds struggles she had to endure to obtain the throne and her almost-as-difficult defence of it.Superb. Reasonably accurate, historically, and very interesting. Could easily have ended as a dry docudrama but director Shekhar Kapur ensures the film is engaging, intriguing and edifying. Allied with this is a superb performance from Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth, a performance that earned her her first Oscar nomination. Throw in some fantastic sets and costumes and this is a lavish, entertaining and edifying drama.",9,0,0,26 May 2018
Ted," Good comedy
","Good comedy and first movie from Seth MacFarlane, creator of the superb Family Guy. Very funny at times and contains many of the Family Guy nuances, in particular the clever throwaway tangential comments. The drama and action are fairly conventional though, but I guess something has to fill in the non-funny moments.Decent performances from Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis, Joel Mchale and Giovanni Ribisi, and Seth MacFarlane as the voice of Ted. Host of cameos / 'as themselves' make the movie even more interesting: Nora Jones, Sam Jones, Ted Danson, Tom Skerritt, Ryan Reynolds.",7,0,0,26 May 2015
Knives Out," Excellent murder-drama
","Successful, extremely wealthy, crime-novelist Harlan Thrombey is found dead with his throat cut. The most likely cause is suicide but famed detective Benoit Blanc has been hired to investigate whether he was murdered or not. At least four of his relatives have a motive. Blanc finds an ally and useful source of information in Marta, Harlan Thrombey's nurse. However, Marta may know more than she is letting on.Excellent murder-drama, written and directed by Rian Johnson. Highly original and intelligent plot that starts like a Hercule Poirot mystery but pretty quickly follows its own unique track. Quite clever audience manipulation by Johnson: you think you have it all sussed out...but you don't. Wonderfully unpredictable and murky, while appearing transparent.All-star cast delivers in spades. Daniel Craig is great as Benoit Blanc, putting on a southern accent and pulling it off with aplomb. Supporting cast includes Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Evans, Michael Shannon, Toni Collette and Christopher Plummer and none of them put a foot wrong. The stand-out, however, is by the least-known cast member: Ana De Armas as Marta. She probably has the most screen time in the movie and is superb in her role.A fantastic new slant on the murder-mystery drama, especially as the genre can be quite formulaic.",9,3,6,19 April 2020
The Secret in Their Eyes," Interesting
",Interesting Spanish whodunnit. Well written and directed - quite gritty. Overly long though - drifts in the mid-section.,7,0,2,22 October 2018
The Irishman," Incredible story
","In a nursing home Frank 'The Irishman' Sheeran recounts his days as a teamster and mob hitman. Included in his history is his association with famed Union leader Jimmy Hoffa.Incredible story. Based on the book 'I heard you paint houses' by Charles Brandt and directed by Martin Scorsese, the movie features the usual Scorsese elements of grittiness and engaging storytelling. Quite an intriguing plot, revolving around one of history's most famous mysteries.Scorsese also surrounds himself with his favourite actors - Robert De Niro (of course), Joe Pesci and Harvey Keitel - and actors with 'mob movie cred': Al Pacino, Stephen Graham (who played Al Capone in Boardwalk Empire), Bobby Carnavale. It's as if Scorsese was trying to include at least one face from every major mob movie or TV series. I'm sure if James Gandolfini was alive he'd have a part! Steven Van Zandt does have a very minor part, so The Sopranos is still represented!However, in creating this all-star cast the first problem appears: De Niro, Pacino and Pesci are too old for their roles. While some of the scenes are set when the actors are older, much of the movie is set in their middle ages, 30s and 40s. Despite all the best attempts to make them look younger, through makeup and special effects, it is clear that they are not that young, through their movements. It is difficult to imagine Frank Sheeran / Robert De Niro as much of a threat when he looks so fragile.As much as Scorsese wanted to stay loyal to people like De Niro and Pesci, and remind audiences of his previous work with them, a better option would have been to hire younger actors for the roles. It is easier to make a younger actor older than an older actor younger.The other issue is the length of the movie. At 3½ hours the film it was always going to be interesting to see whether the film could remain engaging throughout. It mostly is, but there are scenes that could easily have been edited out. While it never really drifts, Scorsese could easily have conveyed the same amount of plot development with less detail.Overall, a great movie, but not perfect.",8,4,11,7 December 2019
Billy Elliot," Charming and funny
","Charming story about how a boy from a mining town becomes a ballet dancer. Shows his trials and tribulations in convincing his rough-hewn father and brother to support him. Story is manipulatively sentimental, but has many funny moments. Maybe a bit too join-the-dots, and didn't dig deep enough into the characters. Direction is solid, though the movie loses pace in the middle section and drifts a bit. The use of music was great, though there is an over-reliance on T-Rex.Good performances all round. Julie Walters deserved her Oscar nomination.",8,0,0,5 March 2016
Point Break," Craptacular
","A former extreme sports athlete, Johnny Utah, joins the FBI. While not even a full agent, he is sent to infiltrate a gang of extreme sports athletes who are attempting a series of death-defying challenges called the Ozaki 8. They use the challenges as a front to pull off daring robberies and are lead by the charismatic, fearless Bodhi.The original Point Break was released in 1991 and starred Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves. It was entertaining, with a coherent, fairly plausible, intriguing plot and decently-developed characters.The 2015 version of Point Break bears very little resemblance to the original. About the only commonalities are the title, the names of the two main characters and that its about a cop infiltrating a robbery gang. Surfing has been replaced by extreme (to the point of being implausible) sports, the plot is close to non-existent and the characters have no substance.It's pretty much just one long ridiculous-action sequence, with the occasional piece of clumsy, contrived dialogue thrown in. Performances are hammy and weak - even Keanu Reeves looks like Marlon Brando compared to these guys.Avoid.",2,2,2,9 December 2016
127 Hours," Incredibly padded and vastly overrated
","How on earth did this movie get nominated for six Oscars, especially Best Picture, Best Leading Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay? Pretty dull, once Ralston is trapped in the canyon. Before then, it was OK. Unfortunately the canyon scene consumes more than half the movie, and is mostly just padding. James Franco's Oscar nomination is incredibly perplexing. He spends most of the movie in one spot, staring vacantly. Considering his acting, er, 'ability', probably the only Oscar nomination he will get, so we'll let him have his moment of glory, I guess.Would have been OK as a 45-minute TV documentary-drama. A 93-minute cinema movie - you've got to be kidding.",4,2,3,6 March 2014
Finding Nemo," An animation classic
","An animation classic.Good family fun from Disney and Pixar. Entertaining from start to finish, with a touch of emotion too. Some funny moments and a rollicking story. Hardly slows down for a moment.Superb animation - such vivid colours, and a seamless movement effect. Certainly a far cry from the old colour-in-inside-the-lines animation.However, it is probably the voices that make the movie. Superb casting in this regard. Ellen DeGeneres steals the show as Dory but every voice is well-chosen and spot-on. Filled with stars too, so it is often a case of spot-the-voice: Willem Dafoe, Albert Brooks, Geoffrey Rush, Allison Janney, Stephen Root.Kids will love this, and so too will adults.",8,1,2,7 November 2014
Creed," Very good, and surprisingly so
","Adonis Johnson is the son of Apollo Creed, former heavyweight champion of the world and the man Rocky Balboa lost to in his first title fight. Apollo Creed died before Johnson was born, so he never knew his father. Johnson is also a fighter and is 15-0, though in unofficial fights in Mexico. Working in an office he decides to fight full time. He leaves Los Angeles and moves to Philadelphia, hoping to get Rocky Balboa as his trainer. Eventually they team up, and slowly Johnson's career starts to take shape. Meanwhile, the light heavyweight champion of the world, Englishman Ricky Conlan, is looking for someone to fight...Very good, and surprisingly so. I figured this movie was made to milk the Rocky brand just one more time. The Rocky sequels were mostly pretty empty, all-about-the-money, affairs and I expected the same from this. So I was pleasantly surprised when this was hardly an empty, style- over substance movie. The characters have depth, the background is set out very well and the plot development is good. Moreover, the characters are engaging and the story is interesting. Another factor in its favour is the linking to the Rocky and Apollo Creed stories, and the passing of the torch to the new generation. It's similar to what Star Wars has done - reboot the entire series with the next generation of characters, while having links to the original characters.On that note, like Star Wars, the plot does take a familiar, recycled form, but it doesn't feel stale or overly unoriginal.Solid performance by Michael B Jordan in the lead role. Good support from Sylvester Stallone and Tessa Thompson. Stallone got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his efforts.",8,2,3,8 September 2016

","Entertaining baseball movie.Details the rise and fall and rise of a naturally gifted player, Roy Hobbs (played by Robert Redford). Full of heart, sentimentality and great baseball action.Interesting plot, thought not entirely convincing or watertight. Relies more on sentimentality (though not overdone or overly sugary), emotion and character-depth than on being 100% plausible.Solid performance in the lead role from Robert Redford.

The Others," Clever supernatural-thriller
","Clever supernatural-thriller.Very different to your average supernatural-drama/horror movie. In fact, just calling it a horror movie degrades it. Very clever plot, well told, and with great deception.Part of the deception is that Nicole Kidman is in this. She usually stars in pretentious roles, and often in pretentious dramas (eg Moulin Rouge). Her character in this is quite stuck up and stuffy (ie true to form) but her presence belies the intelligent and thrilling nature of the movie.This said, she puts in a solid performance, in a genre which would be foreign to her. Good supporting cast too.If you enjoyed The Sixth Sense, you'll enjoy this.",8,1,2,17 May 2015
Brokeback Mountain," Moving, groundbreaking drama
","Moving, groundbreaking drama,Original drama, about a homosexual relationship between two cowboys. There had been movies with homosexual characters in the lead before (The Sum of Us springs most immediately to mind), but this adds something new. It spans 20 or so years, and covers all the ups and downs, issues (real and imagined) in their lives and relationship. Societal problems are also examined.Moving ending.Great performance by Heath Ledger in the lead role. Good support from Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Williams. All three received Oscar nominations.Great cinematography and scenery too.Only issues I have with the movie is that it possibly wasn't engaging enough. It seems to drift in spells. Ultimately, while showing the dilemma the two have, there isn't a great solution or profound moment at the end. Not that the movie needed to necessarily have one. Life doesn't always turn out neat solutions to problems, and the movie was more about the journey through the two's lives than the ending. However, after all that had gone before, maybe a more powerful ending was called for.",8,0,0,19 April 2015

This is the story of Ed Wood.Superb biopic, directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp as Ed Wood. The Burton-Depp combination is critical to the brilliance of this movie. My most accounts Wood was an eccentric character and who better to direct a movie on such a man than Tim Burton and who better to play him than Johnny Depp.The finished product is quite wonderful in its portrayal of Wood. For all the criticism he faces as a director, he remains naively, serenely optimistic in the quality of his films. While his qualities as an artist can be faulted, his enthusiasm and perseverance cannot. Great homage to an underestimated, misunderstood devotee of the silver screen.",9,1,1,24 May 2018

Help comes unexpectedly in the form of Rocky, the flying rooster.Fun animated movie, produced, written and directed by Nick Park and Peter Lord, who also gave us the Wallace and Gromit films. A rollicking plot with good action sequences, some very funny moments, and a touch of sentimentality make it difficult to dislike. The nods to classic WW2 prisoner of war movies, especially The Great Escape, add to the charm.Will mostly appeal to kids but adults will enjoy it too.",7,1,1,14 April 2020

Spotlight," Well timed and very well made
","Well timed and very well made.The true story of how, in 2001, reporters at the Boston Globe investigated accusations of Catholic priests in Boston molesting children. Following on from leads, interviews with victims, existing court cases and extensive research they reveal decades of abuse. Moreover, they discover that the issue was far wider spread than they at first believed, that senior members of the diocese were aware of the issue and that the church systemically covered up the crimes.A well made movie: interesting and intriguing. It had the potential to degenerate into a dull, dry paint-by-numbers docudrama but writer-director Tom McCarthy gives the characters depth, builds the intrigue like a spy thriller and makes a very realistic-feeling movie about investigative journalism.The director is aided by some great, understated performances from his cast. Michael Keaton is the pick of the bunch but Mark Ruffalo, Liev Schreiber, Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, Brian d'Arcy James and Stanley Tucci put in solid performances too.Another factor the movie has in its favour is timing: (alleged) abuse of children by priests of the Catholic church is a highly charged, highly publicized, internationally widespread, current issue. While I do not think Spotlight was the best film of 2015 (for me, that honour goes to Room), Spotlight isn't far behind the best in terms of pure cinematic quality plus it taps into a highly topical issue. I thus think it is the contemporary nature of its subject matter that saw it edge out the competition for the Best Picture Oscar in 2016, and I don't see a problem in that (despite my preference for Room). One of the purposes of art is to capture the look, feel and issues of the times and preserve them for posterity. Spotlight fulfils this function very well.",9,0,0,5 May 2016

","Raises your hopes...then dashes them.I am not a fan of the Terminator movie series, but this started well enough, giving me high hopes. Unfortunately it quickly disappointed, going the way of its predecessors: great CGI, but no plot. It just drifts from one mindless explosion-filled scene to the next.In keeping with the one-dimensional storyline, the acting is fairly wooden.

Neighbours claim that the house is haunted and pretty soon it looks like they might be correct... Then one day Mei wanders into the forest and discovers an interesting creature, Totoro...The first and, so far, only Hayao Miyazaki movie I've liked, and I've seen all six of his movies that are in the IMDb Top 250. Generally his movies start well, with an intriguing, imaginative set up. However, they tend to quickly degenerate into a rambling adventure for a plot with random action scenes and equally random solutions to problems, and no character depth or engagement. Pretty much suitable for kids only.However, My Neighbour Totoro is different. There's no rambling adventure or random action scenes, but a sweet, focused story. The characters have depth and are likable and engaging. The plot develops gradually and meticulously. There's a beautiful child-like sense of discovery and wonder to the movie.Nice, emotional ending too.Kids will love it but it is ideal for all ages.",7,0,1,7 March 2016
500 Days of Summer," Wonderful movie.
","Wonderful movie. From the trailer it may appear like your typical boringly predictable romantic comedy, but in reality is a great comedy-drama, with great meaning and relevance, and an amazing twist. Clever plot - not at all predictable, and very original. Direction is equally innovative, switching between different periods of time deftly, seamlessly and to the betterment of the movie. The choice of lead actors was inspired. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are superb in the lead roles. The chemistry is spot-on, and both are suitably quirky and non-mainstream, avoiding it becoming a common-or-garden shmaltzy romance.Topping it all off is a superb soundtrack. The music, excellent in isolation, is integrated perfectly into the movie, and is not overdone. A must-see.",10,4,5,19 February 2018
The Jungle Book," Wonderful, fun movie, suitable for all ages
","A wonderful, fun movie, suitable for all ages. One of the more memorable Disney movies. Mostly because of its great soundtrack. Just about every song sticks in your head, never to depart (and thankfully so). The songs move the story along, and give the whole movie a fun, innocent, feel-good vibe.Animation is great too. Some of the tricks and shots are quite outstanding.Voices are spot-on. So many good voice-performances it is hard to pick a stand-out. Louis Prima probably gets the nod due to providing the swingingest, jazziest song of the movie, King Louie's 'I Wanna Be Like You (The Monkey Song)'.Only negative is that the plot is fairly basic.An animated classic, and not just for kids.",8,1,3,24 August 2014
Don Jon," Inauspicious directing and writing debut for JGL
","An inauspicious directing and writing debut for Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Dull plot, clumsy direction. The whole movie feels like it was a school project.Character development is superficial, at best. (Though they were fairly superficial characters. Movie could have been called 'Neanderthal mating habits'...)Some parts of the plot make no sense at all. The romance between Gordon-Levitt's character and Julianne Moore's character seemed incredibly contrived and implausible.Performances are fine. JGL does a good impersonation of a New Jersey native, and Scarlett Johansson does a good stuck-up princess routine, while looking good doing it. Julianne Moore is irritating, but that's mostly due to the script.Joseph Gordon-Levitt can only get better from here, directing- and writing-wise.",4,0,3,29 August 2014
Deadpool 2," Hilariously funny: a great follow-up to the first Deadpool movie
","After his trials and tribulations in the first movie, the life of Wade Wilson (aka Deadpool) has now settled down. He's still killing bad guys, but it's more business-as-usual now. Moreover, he and girlfriend Vanessa are madly in love and want to start a family. Then a tragic event throws his life into disarray.The first Deadpool movie was great, and was a very pleasant surprise, being a comic book movie. Instead of the usual CGI-driven, all style no substance, drivel that most comic book movies are, Deadpool was a comedy, and a really good one. Outrageously funny, original and entertaining. Clever, snappy, laugh-a-minute dialogue. Some great cultural references and in-jokes, especially regarding other comic book movies.Deadpool 2 continues in the same vein. Some brilliantly funny, laugh-out-loud moments, often based around in-jokes, cultural references and film-industry-deprecating humour.More action than the first, which is disappointing. Part of Deadpool's charm is that it parodies other comic book movies. By becoming an action movie it threatens to become what it is parodying. There's always an element of humour involved though, even in the deadliest fight scenes, and in so doing the writer and director manage to avoid the hypocrisy of the film becoming what it mocks.Great work again from Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool: his comedic timing and delivery is spot-on. Good supporting cast, with Josh Brolin playing a great straight character to Reynolds' clowning.",8,5,7,3 March 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Better than the average comic book movie

Thor and Loki accidentally end up on Sakaar, a planet run by the The Grandmaster, part-tyrant, part-ringmaster. Thor is imprisoned on the planet and forced to fight to the death against The Grandmaster's champion...the Hulk.Entertaining, and better than the average comic book movie. The reason for the elevated status is the humour and lightness injected by New Zealand director Taika Waititi, the man who directed the superb What We Do In the Shadows, as well as Boy, Hunt for the Wilderpeople and Eagle vs Shark. Rather than the usual boring CGI, action and nothing else this movie is quite funny, with some great one-liners (though Waititi generally reserves the best ones for himself, as Korg).Unfortunately, there is still the obligatory dose of comic book action, so it isn't all good, but overall it is a reasonably entertaining experience.",7,0,5,30 June 2018
Match Point," A bit of a departure for Woody Allen, and it's a great one
","A bit of a departure for Woody Allen, and it's a great one.A young, working-class coach at a prestigious tennis club, Chris Wilton (played by Jonathan Rhys Myers), forms a relationship with Chloe Hewett (Emily Mortimer), the sister of Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), one of the members at the club. The Hewetts are very wealthy - their father owns a large company - and the relationship with Chloe should be Chris' ticket to the easy life. However, he meets Tom's American fiancé, Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), and is immediately smitten. Due to Nola being engaged to Tom, nothing really happens and Chris marries Chloe. Then Tom and Nola break off their engagement and Chris starts a relationship with Nola, with disastrous consequences...A rare murder-drama from Woody Allen. His first of the genre and certainly his darkest movie. Quite a departure for him: while most renowned as a comedy writer-director, even his dramas of the past had a lightness to them. This is nothing like anything he has made before, or since, and is fantastic.Great plot. A slow-burner that starts as a harmless relationship drama and gets darker and deadlier the further it goes. This is not to say that it is dull to start off: even before it ramps up it is a great character study.Some excellent twists towards the end with a superb ending. Quite profound too.Solid performances all round. Nobody puts a foot wrong. Emily Mortimer is a tad irritating as the mousy, clingy Chloe, but that is probably intentional on Woody Allen's part.",10,5,6,27 March 2016
Children of Heaven," Sweet, though not very profound, movie
","Ali has a problem. He has just lost the prized pair of shoes of his sister, Zahra. He tries to find them but to no avail. Now he and Zahra have to share shoes at school, a situation which causes all sorts of problems. Ali comes up with other plans to get Zahra a pair of shoes. Meanwhile, Zahra thinks she may have tracked down the new owner of her shoes.Sweet movie from Iran. The spin-off events from the loss of the shoes and the adventures of the kids are quite entertaining. Also a great, warmth-filled reminder of life's simple pleasures and how things which may seem unimportant to one person in one culture and/or socio- economic sphere can be vitally important to someone with different circumstances.Not particularly profound though. The movie doesn't really come up with much in the way of profundities or even a powerful conclusion (in fact, the conclusion is fairly weak). It's a simple, linear story with very few frills or great twists, told engagingly and with great warmth.The movie was nominated for Best Foreign Film at the 1999 Oscars, losing out in the end to Life is Beautiful.",7,1,1,9 April 2017
Midnight in Paris," Highly original and one of the better Woody Allen movies of the last few years
","One of the more original movies I've seen in the last few years. The central plot - person gets magically transported back to Paris in the 1920s and meets some of the luminaries of the art world of that time - is very interesting and entertaining.However, after a while it gets a bit tedious. You start to expect famous characters at every turn, and lo and behold, there they are. Salvador Dali (played by Adrien Brody) appears, for no reason other than to have an arcane semi-funny musing about a rhinoceros!It also started to feel like everything was one big in-joke: you need to know the art world of the 1920s to follow some of the sub- plots and comments.Thankfully, just when it looks like it is going to degenerate into Woody Allen showing us how many famous people from the 1920s he can fit into one movie, he brings things back on track, and ultimately makes a very good point.One thing you cannot disparage about the movie is the dialogue. It contains all the usual Woody Allen neurosis and intellectual pondering, and the humour is as sharp as ever. With age, Woody Allen has become more content to reduce the number of jokes in his movies, but make them more impactful. Rather than just have a laugh-a-minute, he now takes extraordinary care and length in setting up his punchlines, so when the jokes come, they come out of the blue and with a vengeance.Little wonder then that Woody Allen won the Best Original Screenplay Oscar.Solid performances all round. I am not a fan of Owen Wilson, but he captured the usual Woody Allen leading character (neurotic, over- thinking, indecisive) well. Good performance too from Rachel McAdams. The supporting cast is quite star-studded - Michael Sheen, Marion Cotillard, Kathy Bates, Carla Bruni, Adrien Brody - and they don't put a foot wrong.Worth a watch. Just bear with Mr Allen in the middle section and you will be well rewarded.",8,1,2,19 October 2017
A Bridge Too Far," Superb WW2 drama
","The true story of Operation Market Garden, the Allies' attempt, in September 1944, to hasten the end of WW2 by driving through Belgium and Holland into Germany. The idea was for two US airborne divisions to take the towns of Eindhoven and Nijmegen and a British airborne division, reinforced by a Polish airborne brigade, to take the town of Arnhem. They would be reinforced, in due course and in turn, by the British XXX Corps, land-based and driving up from the British lines in the south. The key to the operation was the bridges, as if the Germans held or blew them, the paratroopers could not be relieved. Faulty intelligence, Allied high command hubris and stubborn German resistance would ensure that Arnhem was a bridge too far.A very well made film on one of WW2's more controversial operations. The movie captures well the scale of the endeavour and the heroism and resourcefulness involved. While most of the scenes are from the Allied side we also see the German command's perspective, and thus the strategic situation. Very realistic and historically accurate.Incredible cast, probably the greatest whose-who of actors ever assembled for one movie: Sean Connery, Laurence Olivier, Gene Hackman, Robert Redford, Anthony Hopkins, Dirk Bogarde, Michael Caine, Ryan O'Neal, Edward Fox, James Caan, Maximilian Schell, Hardy Kruger, Liv Ullman, Elliott Gould, Denholm Elliott. Can't fault any of the performances though the salary bill must have been huge!A must-see for anyone interested in history and/or for lovers of realistic, accurate war movies.",9,2,4,13 May 2016

The Terminator," Entertaining sci-fi action-drama
","Entertaining sci-fi action-drama.Revolutionary special effects are what makes this movie special. The effects, from 1984, are still good even by today's standards. The plot is not bad either. Unlike most of James Cameron's movies, which are purely style over substance (yes, I'm thinking of Titanic and Avatar in particular), this movie has a decent plot. Not entirely watertight, but it exists and is reasonably coherent and plausible and not merely a medium for linking action scenes.Though he had done the two Conan movies before this, it is this movie that made Arnold Schwarzenegger a star. Not there for his acting abilities, or linguistic skill, he was every bit the action figure (not quite action hero...). Linda Hamilton was solid in her role (though her hair style shows this movie was made in the 80s...). Michael Biehn was OK, though sometimes came off as too over-the-top in his performance.",7,4,5,10 May 2014

I am not generally into horror or disaster movies, but this was very innovative and compelling and had me hooked the whole way. The human drama side of the story was also very interesting and moving.Good acting by a young and inexperienced cast. Unpredictable and original plot. The accidental-documentary style was a stroke of genius.The style isn't that original (Blair Witch Project and Cannibal Holocaust are good examples of where it has been done before), but this is a very original and innovative application of it.",9,0,2,11 March 2016
Once," Sweet but light on substance
","A man busks in a square in Dublin. By day he helps his father in a vacuum cleaner repair store and then spends his free time singing songs and playing guitar for tips. Most of the songs are his own compositions. Then he meets a young Czech woman who plays piano and writes her own songs. Musically, they are a perfect match. Romantically, there are impediments...I wanted to like this more than I eventually did. The plot was sweet and had heaps of potential. However, there is actually very little in the way of plot development or substance in the movie. It is short - 80 minutes or so - and then a large portion of the movie is taken up by music. Not only does this leave not much left for drama, the songs halt any momentum in the plot.In the end it felt like a short, padded with heaps of music.The music, almost entirely written by the two lead actors - Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova, is okay, generally. Some pretty good songs in there, some quite weak.Good performances by Hansard and Irglova. There is a naturalness and sincerity to them, like watching a home movie, and the chemistry between them is spot-on. The rough-around-the-edges feel to the production helps too.In the end, a bit disappointing as, with a bit more work and less padding, this could have been turned into a truly wonderful relationship drama. Hard to dislike though - it is sweet and the ending is quite emotional.",6,0,0,2 January 2017
Ready Player One," Great: intriguing, intelligent and entertaining
","It is the year 2045 and the world is addicted to virtual reality games and experiences. The ultimate virtual destination is the OASIS and the creator of it, James Halliday, has just died. As his legacy he has left a puzzle that once solved will give the winner the OASIS and Halliday's shares in his company, worth $500 billion. A poverty-stricken teenager, Wade (in-game name Parzival), is determined to win the prize.Great sci fi drama, directed by Steven Spielberg. Highly plausible: the world Spiellberg creates could easily happen and you could easily see virtual reality experiences being how people live their lives and escape reality. The gamer world he portrays is quite accurate, from my own experiences.With this virtual world created, the plot we have in it is quite intriguing and cleverly crafted. There are times when it threatens to be TOO clever and become confusing, but any confusion is temporary as a bit of thinking clears things up.Good special effects, which you'd expect from Spielberg. Good pace, making for great entertainment.Only major negative is that the movie does degenerate into an action movie for a longish spell in the second half. This was disappointing as it had been a great cerebral exercise until then and then it quickly switched to mindless action scenes.Good ending, with a decent message.",8,1,1,15 February 2020
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Good Cold War espionage thriller
","Good Cold War espionage thriller. Not great though - moves very slowly, and seems unnecessarily complex. While I am not in favour of spoon-feeding an audience information - surely you can join the dots without the director holding your hand - here some more details in certain areas would have helped. Cast is a who's-who of British cinema: John Hurt, Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Ciaran Hinds, Tom Hardy. Fine, understated performance by Gary Oldman. Not sure if it is Oscar-worthy, though might be a good reward for numerous superb performances in the past which have gone unnominated.",7,3,4,27 February 2015
The Hateful Eight," Good, gritty, unpredictable drama
","Good, gritty, unpredictable drama.Wyoming in the 1870s. A stagecoach is heading towards the town of Red Rock with two passengers onboard. One is John 'Hangman' Ruth (played by Kurt Russell), a celebrated bounty hunter. The other is Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), his prisoner and wanted for murder. Along the way they pick up another bounty hunter, Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L Jackson), and Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins). Due to a blizzard they are forced to hole up in a store some way out of town with the occupants of another stagecoach. Suspicions commence and Civil War enmities are reawakened...Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, but not among Tarantino's best. This doesn't quite have the quirky dialogue and swagger that you expect from Tarantino. The plot takes a while to kick into top gear and at three hours long it can do with some editing.This said, it feels much shorter than three hours. The dialogue, especially the characters' back-stories, keeps the momentum going. Tarantino doesn't reveal the direction of the movie until late in the piece and the twist is quite unforeseen. Some good action scenes too, with the usual Tarantino trademark of large helpings of blood.Solid performances all round. Might take some patience but well worth watching.",8,5,14,20 January 2016
Gettysburg," Superb
","Superb telling of the story of the battle that was the turning point in the American Civil War, and possibly one of the most important events in American history. Based on Michael Shaara's excellent book, The Killer Angels, the plot is thorough yet not laboured. We see the action from both the Union and Confederate sides, and from many different individuals. The motives and beliefs of both sides are explored quite thoroughly.Historically very accurate.Very realistic battle scenes. Considering that this was made before CGI had evolved to such an extent that computers could draw 20,000 or so realistic-looking soldiers on a battlefield, the level of detail, and scale of the battle, is amazingly recreated.A lot better than its subsequent prequel, Gods and Generals.",10,0,0,19 April 2014
Catch-22," Great satire on the insanity and inanity of war
","WW2, the Mediterranean theatre. Captain Yossarian is the bombardier of a B-25 medium bomber. His squadron's missions largely involve bombing targets on the Italian mainland. A veteran of countless missions, he has become cynical about the war and pessimistic about his chances of surviving. He should have been rotated home a long time ago, but the Wing's Commanding Officer, Colonel Cathcart, keeps raising the number of missions required to rotate out. Yossarian hits upon a plan to get sent home. However, there's a catch.Great satire on the insanity and inanity of war, based on Joseph Heller's brilliant novel. Very funny, showing the silliness of bureaucracy, military rules and leadership and inept leadership in general. Over-the-top in its amping up and criticism of these structures. Some good general humour too.It's not all comedy though. Shows the consequences and casualties of the rules and ineptitude and does so quite dramatically.Great performances from an all-star cast. Alan Arkin is superb as Yossarian. Supporting cast are a who's who of the entertainment industry: Martin Balsam, Orson Welles, Bob Newhart, Anthony Perkins, Martin Sheen (in his third movie), Art Garfunkel, Jon Voight, Norman Fell, Bob Balaban.However, helps if you haven't read the book. I first watched this soon after having read the book and wasn't impressed. The novel is one of my favourite books of all time and the movie didn't capture what made the book so great - the clever, funny descriptions of situations. The movie tries to replicate these through visual gags and dialogue but, while these work fairly well, they don't quite have the impact. The movie suffers badly if compared directly to the book. Rewatching the movie now, more than 20 years since reading the book, I now appreciate how good the movie is in its own right.",8,2,3,3 June 2018
"I, Tonya"," Great movie - funny and emotional
","The life story of Tonya Harding, champion ice-skater. From her life as a young child to teenager to adult life everything centred on ice-skating. Then came the Nancy Kerrigan incident...Great movie. Could have easily been a fairly dry paint-by-numbers biopic but writer Steven Rogers and director Craig Gillespie infuse the movie with humour and lightness giving it a great deal of energy and engagement. There's also a character-based side to it, especially in terms of how Harding's mother shapes her personality and views on life. This leads her to accept the abusive, dysfunctional relationship with Jeff Gillooly, her first husband, which brings about her downfall.The light tone does change from a point, and it is a bit disconcerting. As things get more criminal, the lightness is replaced by a seriousness and the movie starts to resemble more the conventional biopic one would have expected. There is still a degree of humour: the bodyguard and the hired thugs take stupidity to another level (and, by the looks of things, this wasn't dramatized - they were really that dumb). However, the come-down from the energy and comedy of the first half does make for an uneasy transition. There was no way round it though - it would have been inappropriate to maintain the level of frivolity considering what happens.Ultimately the transition works out well, as the movie ends very emotionally.Superb performances by Margot Robbie as Tonya Harding and Allison Janney as her mother. Robbie would not have seemed the right person to play an uneducated, working class, incredibly intense, foul-mouthed competitor with hordes of demons but she pulls it off with aplomb. Well deserved her Best Actress Oscar nomination.Allison Janney won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance and the choice is hard to fault. She is fantastic as the aggressive, uncouth mother.",8,5,9,4 July 2018
We Were Soldiers," Great battle scenes but pretty weak in many other areas
","Great battle scenes but pretty weak in many other areas.A telling of the 1st Battalion, 7 Cavalry Regiment, 1st Calvary Division's battle against overwhelming odds in the La Drang valley of Vietnam in 1965. Seen through the eyes of the battalion's commander, Lt. Col. Hal Moore (played by Mel Gibson), we see him take command of the battalion and its preparations to go into Vietnam. We also see how the French had, years earlier, been defeated in the same area. The battle was to be the first major engagement between US and NVA forces in Vietnam and showed the use of helicopters as mobility providers and assault support aircraft.Very gritty battle scenes. Captures well the chaos and confusion of battle, plus the desperation and terror involved when things aren't going well. Mostly accurate, by most accounts, though some minor liberties are taken for dramatic effect.The problem, however, lies with just about everything else. Dialogue is quite over-the-top, as if just about everybody is played by John Wayne. Many simple passages of dialogue are turned into speeches, and cliché-filled speeches at that.In keeping with the cheesy dialogue, some pretty heavy-handed, overly gung ho scenes too. Once again, reminded me of a John Wayne movie.Overall, quite entertaining, just uneven because of the mix of gritty battle scenes and cheesy dialogue and other scenes.",6,0,0,1 May 2016
Molly's Game," Highly engaging and interesting
","Molly Bloom was a talented skier with Olympic aspirations and potential. Now she has been arrested on a variety of federal charges, all related to her running high stakes poker games. This is how her life moved from the one point to the other.Great drama, based on a true story and written and directed by Aaron Sorkin. Incredibly engaging and interesting: through jumping ahead to her arrest and then filling in the back story, Sorkin hooks you and reels you in. The end result is riveting viewing.All this is aided and abetted by some very sharp, clever and snappy dialogue and some well-placed humour, Sorkin trademarks.Also helping the quality of the film is an excellent performance by Jessica Chastain. She inhabits her role and contributes tremendously to the engagement and eyes-glued-to-screen factors (for a variety of reasons...). Solid support by Idris Elba as Charlie Jaffey, her attorney. The chemistry between the two of them is another positive contributing factor to the movie.",9,2,3,25 December 2018

After a train robbery goes wrong the find themselves on the run with a posse hard on their heals. Their solution - escape to Bolivia!Superb movie. While having the appearances of a western it's more than that. Quite funny and many of the themes could have played out in any era. If anything, it captures the end of the old Wild West.Great performances by Paul Newman and Robert Redford in the lead roles.

","The Ocean's 11 gang are back, with a new team member. Just when they thought they could enjoy their spoils, Terry Benedict appears, and he wants his money back...Quite dull. Lots of style, but very little substance. Plot is basic, despite some convolutions to disguise this fact. Steven Soderbergh's direction is strangely amateurish.Even the performances seem quite hammy at times. Considering that just about every actor in the movie is a megastar, that says something.Only real upside is that it is fast-paced, so never feels entirely boring, even though nothing substantial is happening.",4,1,2,24 August 2016

","A movie that covers a few days in the lives of several different people. They come from different backgrounds, are often total strangers and are generally just going about their everyday lives. However, over the next day or so their lives will interconnect, crashing together, in dramatic and often life-changing ways.Great, emotional examination of racism, and prejudice in general. very well set up - the (seemingly) parallel lives and stories (Short Cuts- style). The ways the lives cross paths, the interaction and the effect of this is something to behold. Incredibly powerful, profound and emotional.",9,2,4,4 February 2017
BlacKkKlansman," Great movie: funny, gripping and thought-provoking
","Mid-1970s. Ron Stallworth joins the Colorado Springs Police Department, becoming its first African-American officer. After a while he becomes a detective. Then he infiltrates the Ku Klux Klan.Great movie, directed by Spike Lee. The main part of the story - African-American detective infiltrates the Ku Klux Klan - seems preposterous but is true, being based on Ron Stallworth's book. Spike Lee uses the absurdity of this event to great effect, with many situations that are quite hilarious. The movie could easily have just been a comedy, as Lee keeps the humour coming, and doesn't just rely on the central plot for that.However, it's far more than a comedy. As a cop-drama it is very interesting too, with an intriguing crime angle and some gripping developments. The conclusion to this feels a bit trite and Hollywoodized, however: in reality Stallworth's investigation did not end so dramatically, or so poetically in its justice.The social commentary aspect is also, for the most part, well done. The African-American experience is well shown. With regard to the KKK, Lee could easily have drawn the KKK members as one-dimensional, redneck, cartoon-character stereotypes but does a great job at humanising them, plus showing the different types within the KKK: from the stupid and easily lead, to the violent, nothing-is-beyond-them types to the cunning leaders, for whom spreading hate is an industry and a career. Moreover, it's fairly well balanced: Lee doesn't create a black vs white rhetoric but shows that it is racist pockets within society that are to blame.However, some of the shine does get taken off this objectivity at the end, with Lee trying to draw parallels with current events, and taking aim at current political leaders. While showing that racism and organisations like the KKK still exist and need to be eradicated is a pertinent message, the way it was presented just felt cheap.",8,6,10,7 April 2019
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Brilliant - simultaneously funny and deadly serious.
","Brilliant cold-war comedy-drama by Stanley Kubrick. Captures very accurately the angst and paranoia of the Cold War, especially from the view of the US military. And then proceeds to parody it...Hilariously funny, but peel away the humour and I imagine this movie would have hit a nerve in the 1960s. The threat of nuclear war and the entire planet being destroyed was very real then. Kubrick exposes just how easy the path to our own destruction could have been. Peter Sellers outdoes even himself by starring in three roles, each of whom is quite different. All use his comedic skills to the maximum but there is a large element of drama in the roles, esp Group Captain Mandrake. Sellers shows he is not just a great comedic actor, but a good dramatic actor too. (See Being There if you need any more proof).Good support from George C Scott, Sterling Hayden and Slim Pickens.The Cold War may be over, but this movie has lost none of its effectiveness. A must-see and an all-time classic.",10,1,3,12 March 2014
The Expendables," Watching this, you can feel your IQ reducing...
","Very lame. I guess the story behind the movie goes something like this: Sylvester Stallone decides to make a movie with old buddies, most of whom are, like him, has-beens who never could act anyway (see Dolph Lundgren, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Eric Roberts, Jet Li), though some (Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis) are pretty good. Decides to throw in some fresh, well-known faces (Jason Statham, David Zayas of Dexter fame) and sports stars (Randy Couture, Steve Austin) to bring in the kids. Having locked in the cast, discovers there is no budget left for a decent writer or director, so decides to do those himself.Thus was born The Expendables - no plot, no direction, but every face a star and heaps of crap gets blown up in bright colours and with a loud bang.Avoid, unless you want to be able to pinpoint the moment your IQ reduced.",2,2,3,7 November 2015
MASH," Wonderfully funny and subversive military satire
","Set during the Korean War, two surgeons, Captains 'Hawkeye' Pierce (played by Donald Sutherland) and 'Duke' Forrest (Tom Skerritt), join the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH), located three miles from the front lines. Both are draftees and care little for military protocols and conventions. They are soon joined by surgeon even more anarchic and insubordinate in his attitude, Captain 'Trapper' John McIntyre (Elliott Gould). The unit's commander is the laid back-yet-efficient Lt Colonel Henry Blake (Roger Bowen). He is assisted by Corporal 'Radar' O'Reilly (Gary Burghoff). Hawkeye, Duke and Trapper soon have the camp running to their rather non-military tune but run into Major Frank Burns (Robert Duvall) and the new chief nurse Major Margaret O'Houlihan (Sally Kellerman), both of whom being by-the- book permanent military types. Hawkeye, Duke and Trapper set out to undermine the pair. High jinks ensue.A wonderfully funny and subversive military satire, directed by Robert Altman. Some hilarious dialogue and scenes (the football scenes are side-splittingly funny), with the whole movie having a delightfully irreverent and anarchic tone. Against the general backdrop of comedy we also have some reasonably graphic operating theatre scenes. This shows the grim reality of what the characters are facing, and why they need humour to remain sane. It's not all satire...Robert Altman directs with a loose grip (to the point that apparently many of the lines were ad-libbed) and this helps the movie. The sense of disorder is heightened.Even more famous than this movie is the TV series that it spawned. That lasted 11 years.",10,1,2,22 May 2016

Story is quite amazing, and, if true, would amount to about the most incredible feat of survival in history. However, Hollywood is currently full of survival movies, diluting the originality and novelty of this.Solid direction from Peter Weir, though movie could have been shorter. Great scenery and cinematography.Good performances all round.",6,0,0,19 February 2017
Begin Again," Schmaltzy and predictable, but reasonably enjoyable
","Schmaltzy and predictable, but reasonably enjoyable.The story of a washed-up music producer/executive (played by Mark Ruffalo) who discovers a singer-songwriter (played by Keira Knightley). Follows how they then set about getting her music recorded and released.Fairly conventional rag-to-riches (maybe...) storyline. Not too much originality in the plot (except for the recording locations). Overly sweet story too. However, character engagement is good, the music isn't bad and there are some funny moments too.Mark Ruffalo gives a solid performance in his role. However, I didn't really buy Keira Knightley as a singer. Her performance was fine, and the chemistry between her and Ruffalo was great, but she just didn't seem right for the part. Good support from Katherine Keener and Hailee Steinfeld, who showed us that her performance in True Grit wasn't a once-off: she is certainly a superstar in the making.Much musical star-spotting to be had in the supporting roles: Adam Levine (of Maroon 5), Yasiin Bey (Mos Def), Cee Lo Green. Their names alone add a large degree of credibility and respectability to the movie.",6,0,0,18 June 2015

Unfortunately the super-hero turns out to be a super-villain, and Megamind has to assume the role of super-hero in order to stop him.Very good, and surprisingly so. I thought this was going to be another comic-book-hero/animated kids movie. Kids will certainly enjoy it, but so will adults. Good plot, snappy dialogue, very funny, unrelenting pace.

The Book Thief," Emotional journey
","An emotional journey.Set in Germany shortly before and during World War 2, the movie examines the extremes of human nature - intolerance and kindness - as seen through a child's eyes. Very moving at times.Good performances all round. Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson provide the star power and are solid in their performances. However it is 12/13-year old Sophie Nelisse, in the lead role, who steals the show. Great performance, especially for someone so young.Not a perfect movie, however. The plot seemed quite trite at times. The holocaust / Nazi persecution of Jews theme, which seemed to be the main focus of the movie, gets watered down and does not feature in the conclusion. In fact, the conclusion just seemed tacked on and unrelated to the movie.In addition, the narration by Death seemed unnecessary and quite lame. Really didn't see the point of it, especially as narration is supposed to give a movie direction and add useful information. This did none of that.One of the problems could be that the movie was made so that children could see it (it has only a PG age restriction in Australia). This prevented the director from making a movie that was too gritty, realistic or confrontational in its themes.",7,0,1,8 December 2014
Horrible Bosses," Great fun
","Far better than I expected. On the surface it looked like a typical juvenile comedy. Also, it stars Jennifer Aniston, so you know it's going to be fairly shallow. However, it turns out to be hilariously funny, with some great comedic performances. Plot is decent, direction is fluid, though there are scenes which seem overly slapsticky or contrived. Performances are mostly spot-on. Jason Bateman and Jason Sedeikis don't put a foot wrong and Charlie Day is bearable. Supporting cast are excellent, but looking at the names it is hardly a surprise: Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell, Jamie Foxx, plus Donald Sutherland and Bob Newhart in minor roles. Jennifer Aniston is very funny in her role, as well as steaming up the screen.Great fun.",7,10,12,24 October 2015
Black Mass," Engrossing crime-drama
","Boston, late-1970s. The FBI are looking to break the Mafia hold on the north of the city. Agent John Connolly (played by Joel Edgerton) is on the case and is willing to go to any lengths to achieve his aims. A South Boston native, he decides to 'ally' the FBI with South Boston crime kingpin James 'Whitey' Bulger (played by Johnny Depp), as his main enemies are the Mafia. Approaching Bulger via his brother Billy Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch), a Massachusetts State Senator, Connolly is successful in gaining Bulger as an informant and ally against the Mafia. However, this alliance only seems to embolden Bulger in his quest for power and wealth, as he is able to operate with impunity and utter ruthlessness. Not realising he is being duped, Connolly finds himself backing Bulger, rather than law, order and justice.An engrossing crime-drama, based on a true story. As far as gangster dramas go, it's hardly in the league of The Godfather or Goodfellas, but it's entertaining and, besides, not much is in those movies' league. Superb performance by Johnny Depp in the lead role. His choices of movies of late have been sub-par but this is a fine return to form. Very convincing as a ruthless crime lord, with his alternating between mob boss and doting father quite breathtaking.Good work too from Joel Edgerton.",8,0,1,21 August 2016
The Best Years of Our Lives," Unique and compelling drama
","A unique and compelling drama. Unique in that it deals with soldiers returning home from World War 2, and their struggles as they try to fit back into civilian life. Some are physically scarred, and some mentally. Little was known about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder at the time, so the fact that this topic is dealt with so sensitively is quite incredible for the time.This, plus the adjustments they have to make and the fact that their world has changed while they have been away make make for interesting viewing.Compelling too in that it as much a human / relationship drama as an effects-of-war drama. Very emotional, as the servicemen piece their lives back together and try to reestablish / establish relationships, get jobs, etc.Superb directing and camera work by William Wyler. Also a great deal of sensitivity in telling the story. Wyler was involved in the Allied war effort through making documentaries, like the original documentary on the Memphis Belle, so was well aware of what went in to winning the war.Performances are astounding. Dana Andrews is suitably debonair as Fred Derry. Fredric March is a surprise package. His character seems to that of a dull banker but as the movie goes on and on his character becomes funnier and funnier, climaxing in the hilarious dinner speech. March seemed to revel in this side of the role and is great in it.Standout performance, however, goes to Harold Russell as Homer Parish. Russell was not an actor, and was a genuine amputee, playing the role of an amputee. Incredible performance from him, for which he received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar, which showed just how much some soldiers sacrificed in the war, and how they carried on without bitterness.Superb female cast too. Teresa Wright is beautiful and wonderful as Peggy. Virginia Mayo is stunningly beautiful as Marie. Myrna Loy provides the gravitas as Milly Stephenson.A wonderful, emotional, sometimes funny, always compelling movie.",10,4,4,28 March 2014

","Great movie, despite starring, and being directed by, Ben Affleck. Decent plot, gritty, character-based but with plenty of action. Gritty, though maybe a touch unoriginal and too trite, especially with regard to the romantic angle.Excellent direction (that's the biggest surprise) - the car chases are gripping but not overdone, the action is frenetic but not gratuitous, characters have time to be sketched, and some of the scenes could be straight out of the Tarantino playbook.Excellent performances, all round. Ben Affleck is solid in the lead role - and it takes a lot for me to say that. I am generally not a fan of his work. Rebecca Hall is also very good as the romantic interest.Performance of the movie must go to Jon Hamm though, as the clever, tough, no-nonsense FBI agent. Shows that he is not just a TV actor.After been deservedly nominated for a Best Actor Oscar in The Hurt Locker, Jeremy Renner puts in another good performance in a tough- to-the-point-of being-psychotic role.Watch this movie.",9,1,3,15 April 2016

We see how they meet, how their relationships start...and how they end up cheating on each other.Quite dull. It's really just a story of relationship machinations and manipulations for the sake of machinations and manipulations. There is no point, ultimately (except maybe that relationships are doomed to fail so why bother?, but I might be being a bit cynical there...). Execution is pretty stiff and stuffy too. Very wordy, and unnaturally so. Far too much melodrama over things not warranting such drama. You can tell this was originally a play...Quite empty too - superficial, emotionally, and overly schmaltzyOnly two things prevent this from being a total waste of time. One is the humour - there are some great one-liners scattered throughout the movie.The second is the performance of Natalie Portman. She sparkles in her role and got a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for her efforts.Not sure how Clive Owen got his Best Supporting Actor nomination though. His performance largely consists of overacting. He is also the biggest victim of the theatrical script - every line he utters sounds like a speech.",4,1,2,13 March 2016
Suicide Squad," Entertaining, and better than expected
","With Superman dead, the world needs a new band of superheroes to step into the breach. Senior US Intelligence officer Amanda Waller comes up with a daring plan - use extreme criminals with special abilities to fight crime, in exchange for them receiving reduced sentences. The band of crime-fighting criminals is officially known as Task Force X, but due to the nature of their mission a more appropriate name would be Suicide Squad. Reasonably entertaining. Starts off very well - the background and scene setting were great and promised much for the remainder of the movie. Unfortunately, the remainder doesn't quite live up to this promise, as the plot loses focus to an extent.This all said, the movie has great momentum and is never boring. There are some great action scenes and dialogue and the performances provide a great energy to the movie. The standout (for many reasons!) is Margot Robbie who is excellent as Harley Quinn. Jared Leto is great as The Joker (the character seems to inspire great performances - thinking Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger in the past). Solid work too from Will Smith, as Deadshot, and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller.After all the criticism of the movie, it was much better than expected. I can only think it was your typical comic book and superhero movie fans who were disappointed, as this movie is a bit different to most of the genre. I've never read the Suicide Squad comics, and generally am not a fan of comic book / superhero movies, so was able to watch with any preconceived ideas of what this should be like.

The mutiny starts an uprising against the tsarist government among the people of Odessa. However, the government sends a squadron of warships to bring the crew of the Potemkin to heel. Things look grim for the crew.Directed by Sergei Eisenstein, Battleship Potemkin is not just a landmark film in history, for its cinematic innovations, but a great film full stop. Great action, empathetic characters and plot and a fantastic cliff-hanger at the end.Eisenstein's main contribution to cinematic development was 'Soviet montage theory': through clever editing, the viewer is drawn into and carried along with the scene. A great example of this in Battleship Potemkin is the soldiers vs townsfolk scene on the steps. Through dozens of mini-scenes within the main scene, the dynamism, panic and horror of the situation are conveyed to the audience.",8,4,5,21 August 2018

Taxi Driver," Gritty, enthralling and iconic masterpiece
","Gritty, enthralling and iconic masterpiece.Travis Bickle is a New York taxi driver. He is also socially awkward, a loner, an insomniac, a Vietnam veteran and has issues. He sees the criminals - prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers etc - on the streets and views them as dirt, and wishes that a rain would come to wash them away. Initially he is just talk but over time he becomes more angry, bitter, delusional and open to vigilantism and taking matters into his own hands...Brilliant movie by Martin Scorsese. He builds up the story well - first painting Bickle as all talk and no action but then showing us how he develops more into a man of action...radical action. Even once it is obvious that Bickle is now beyond just talking about doing something, you don't know how it is going to pan out. Scorsese toys with the audience, giving us a red herring as the entrÃ©e for the final showdown. Even then there's another twist in store...This slow-burning build up and portrayal of the escalation of Bickle's outlook is superbly aided by a searingly good performance by Robert De Niro as Bickle. He inhabits the character, and a very complex character it is. I doubt that anyone else could have played Bickle that convincingly.De Niro got a Best Actor Oscar nomination and was only prevented from getting the award by an equally brilliant Peter Finch, for Network.Good support from Jodie Foster, Cybill Shepherd, Harvey Keitel and Albert Brooks.

","Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio continue their collaboration, after working together on Gangs of New York, The Aviator and The Departed (all three of which were excellent movies). Add in writer Dennis Lehane (Mystic River) and the acting talents of Ben Kingsley and Mark Ruffalo and it should equal a good movie.Well, kinda. The acting is perfect and the direction spot-on. However, the plot is over-convoluted and filled with so many twists your head will spin.I walked away liking the movie, but thinking it could have been a whole lot better.",6,0,0,21 March 2014

Life of Pi," Incredible, heart-warming movie
","Incredible, heart-warming movie. Don't be fooled by the trailer, which made it look all style and no substance. Yes, the visual effects are amazing, but is so much more than Ang Lee showing off his cinematographic prowess. The story is very emotional, and quite unique as it involves a boy and a tiger. Not only emotional, but spiritual too.Excellent CGI. You would swear there was a real tiger, zebra, hyena etc in the boat with Pi.Solid performances from a cast of unknowns (the only well-known actor in the movie is Gerard Depardieu, and his role is fairly minor). Suraj Sharma is great as Pi.",9,0,2,23 March 2014
Lost in Translation," Beautiful and moving
","One of the most moving movies I have ever seen, right up there with modern classics like Paris, Texas, Million Dollar Baby and American Beauty. A story of two people far from home in a foreign country, with a vastly different pace and way of life to what they are accustomed, and how their friendship gets them through the confusion and loneliness. Sofia Coppola shows a deft touch with her direction. There's a gentleness about it, without allowing the movie to drift.Performances are good. Bill Murray deserved his Best Actor Oscar nomination, giving a dramatic performance that makes good use of his comedic skills. The movie provided Scarlett Johansson's breakthrough role.",10,1,1,12 February 2014
Doctor Strange," Good first half, then quickly degenerates into your usual comic book crap
","Dr. Steven Strange is a brilliant neurosurgeon. He is at the peak of his career when a car accident leaves him with nerve damage in his hands, and unable to continue his career. He tries everything to remedy the situation, but nothing works. In desperation he travels to Kathmandu, Nepal, to seek the an organisation known as Kamar-Taj. What he finds goes beyond healing, or the physical world.Initially, quite interesting. The Dr Strange backstory was an engaging one and made you think that this movie could be different to all those other adaptations of comic book characters.Sadly, it was not to be. From a point the mystical narrative comes into play, which is just an excuse for the director to show off his CGI skills. From then on it's just your usual style-over-substance comic book vapidity.",5,7,13,12 August 2017
We Are Marshall," Not great, but hard to dislike
","Not a great movie, but hard to dislike. Fairly conventional against- all-odds sports movie, with a tragedy as background. Furthermore, it feels overwrought. Everything is over-dramatized and over- sentimentalized. The director blatantly manipulates the audience with syrupy sentiment and grandiose gestures.However, it is difficult to dislike. The whole pulling-oneself-up-by- one's-bootstraps plot is well done, and given due attention. There is also an emotional impact of the team's progress. And who doesn't like a good sports story, especially when it's based on a true story...?Solid performance by Matthew McConaughey in the lead role. Good support from Matthew Fox, Anthony Mackie, David Strathairn, Kate Mara and Ian McShane.",6,2,2,25 September 2014

Interstellar," A sci-fi epic
","An epic science fiction movie. Not just epic due to its running time - about 2 3/4 hours - but also due to its physical scale and the boldness of its concepts. Christopher Nolan has shaped a movie that tackles some fairly complex astrophysical issues, and carried it off with aplomb.Fantastic special effects, a clever plot and decent performances by an all-star cast.Not perfect though. The sci fi parts are great but the relationship / human drama stuff seems clumsy at times. The scene setting at the beginning seems to take forever. We all know the really good stuff - the space scenes - are coming at some stage but Nolan draws out the more mundane earth stuff. Plus, there are scenes and plot detours which feel unnecessary, and periods where the movie seems to drift. The Matt Damon sub-plot just felt like padding. Some of the seemingly unnecessary, overly contrived or implausible things do ultimately have a purpose. The conclusion ties up many loose ends and/or justifies some of the flat moments, but not all.",8,2,6,24 November 2014
Full Metal Jacket," Kubrick's Vietnam War masterpiece
","Marine Corps Recruiting Depot, Parris Island, South Carolina, mid- 1960s. A platoon of raw recruits is receiving its first exposure to the training methods of the Marine Corps. In particular, they are being exposed to Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, a tough, loud, foul- mouthed senior drill instructor. Seen largely through the eyes of one recruit, Private JT 'Joker' Davis We see their training at Hartman's hands, and the effect it has on one recruit in particular, Private Leonard 'Gomer Pyle' Lawrence.Some time later, Joker is now in Vietnam, has risen to Sergeant and is a correspondent for Stars and Stripes magazine. It is a reasonably cushy job until the Tet Offensive is launched. Joker, and his sidekick 'Rafterman', get sent to Hue, a city taken by North Vietnamese forces in the offensive. They attach themselves to a Marine squad which includes a Parris Island buddy of Joker's, Sergeant 'Cowboy'. What follows is war at its most personal, intense and visceral.Superb Vietnam War drama. Directed by Stanley Kubrick and adapted from a novel by Gustav Hasford, Full Metal Jacket is a searingly accurate and intense depiction of war and the military. We see the training, and how recruits are treated, we see the down-time between battles, where boredom is the most common issue, and then we see the intense, life-or-death struggles in battle. A great story, superbly directed.Solid performances all round. Matthew Modine plays the central character, Joker, and he does a great job. Vincent D'Onofrio does a solid job playing the not-altogether-there Gomer Pyle. Adam Baldwin provides the gung ho factor as Animal Mother. Stand out performance and character goes to R Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. He absolutely dominates the first half of the movie and is legitimately scary as the drill instructor. Helps that he was once a Marine NCO himself...",10,0,1,2 July 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Not bad but lacks focus
","In an effort to track down who raped and murdered her daughter, Mildred Hayes has three billboards erected outside her town of Ebbing, Missouri. They accuse the Sheriff of doing nothing to catch the killer. This causes a largely adverse reaction amongst the town's folk , not least one of the sheriff's deputies, the hot-headed, irascible Jason Dixon.Heaps of potential, much of which is wasted. The movie is intriguing and entertaining from the outset - the murder mystery, the town dynamic, the interesting array of characters, all presented with dark tongue-in-cheek humour. Just from the trailer this reminded me of a Coen Brothers movie (not just because it stars Frances McDormand and feels Fargo-esque, or because McDormand is married to Joel Coen) and the initial part of the movies goes some way to reinforce this. However, writer-director Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths) never quite matches the effortless slickness, tightness, engagement, focus and story-telling ability of the Coens. Most tellingly, the plot seems to stumble along, with no clear direction. Yes, there is the murder mystery, which is intriguing to the very end, but the sub-plots around it seem disjointed. Moreover, there is little in the way of clear themes. Even at the end, the messaging is confused and seems to be more a case of McDonagh having a bet each way, rather than making a solid point.A little bit of focus would have gone a long way.Can't fault the cast though. Frances McDormand is excellent as Mildred Hayes, as is Sam Rockwell as Dixon and Woody Harrelson as Sheriff Willoughby. Good supporting cast which includes some biggish names - Peter Dinklage, Abbie Cornish and Kerry Condon.",6,3,5,1 January 2018
The Grapes of Wrath," A masterpiece
","A masterpiece, based on John Steinbeck's classic Pulitzer Prize- winning novel. Captures the desperation, hopelessness and human suffering caused by the Great Depression better than any other movie. Surely one of the saddest, most depressing, movies ever made.Director John Ford pulls no punches. Other than the direct effects of the depression, the depiction of the lengths people go to to abuse the helplessness of other humans is shocking (and very probably true). Yet, among all the cynicism, there are acts of kindness and selflessness that leave you with hope for mankind.Henry Fonda is great as Tom Joad, and deserved his Best Actor Oscar nomination. Supporting cast are superb, with Jane Darwell (as Ma Joad), to the fore. Her Best Supporting Actress Oscar was well- deserved.A must-see, whether you've read the book or not. Realistic human drama at its best.",10,6,6,19 December 2015
Pacific Rim," Mostly formulaic and predictable, but reasonably entertaining
","Mostly formulaic and predictable, but reasonably entertaining. Plot setup is nothing new: alien monsters attack earth, only a handful of good guys stand in their way, epic CGI-produced battles ensue. This one is sort of Starship Troopers meets Transformers. There is the usual token character development, the relationship drama, the fellow good guy who thinks the hero is a loser and hassles him about it, comical side characters, the self-sacrifice for the team and the survival of humanity. We've seen these all before. However, Pacific Rim is quite entertaining. Action scenes are well done and it moves at a good pace. Plot doesn't really let up at any time.So, can take it or leave it. Not a must-see, but not all bad either.",6,0,1,5 August 2014
Empire of the Sun," Good, but not great
","Good, but not great. Started well but drifted excessively in the middle third or so. The result is a 160-minute movie, when, with a bit of good editing and discipline, it could have been 2 hours, and much more interesting.Decent enough plot, but, as mentioned, drawn out too much. Direction from Steven Spielberg is spot-on, as you would imagine. Sumptuous distance- and panning-shots.A 13-year old Christian Bale, in his second cinema-movie role, puts in a great performance. Solid supporting cast - John Malkovich, Nigel Havers, Joe Pantoliano, Miranda Richardson. Interesting too in that Ben Stiller, also in his second cinema-movie, has a very minor role.",6,1,1,29 April 2020
American Sniper," Entertaining war movie
","Entertaining war movie.The story of Chris Kyle, the greatest sniper (in terms of confirmed kills) in US military history. 160 kills in four tours of Iraq.While the war and action scenes are great, the human side seems rather superficial. Director Clint Eastwood tries to make a theme out his struggle between duty and having to kill people (and what war is doing to him and how he relates to his family and other non- combatants) but this is not explored very well. The movie is uneven in that we have intense war scenes followed by back-home scenes which should be emotional but lack depth. Eastwood used to be a master at human drama and deft manipulation of viewers' emotions (see Million Dollar Baby, as a very good example), but here he seems to have lost his touch. Instead he opts for a more bombastic, action-filled approach.The other issue with the movie would be the accuracy of it. By many accounts some of the details are not accurate. The faults lie mainly with some of the lesser details, which have been dramatized for cinema.This all said, while not a brilliant, or multi-layered, movie, American Sniper is a fairly good war movie. It does also raise the thought of what war does to those who fight in it, even (or maybe particularly...) when they are incredibly good at their part in it.",7,4,8,28 May 2015
Glory," Superb, stirring...and necessary
","Superb, stirring...and necessary.The true story of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, told mostly through the eyes of their commander, Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (played by Matthew Broderick). Formed during the American Cicil War, the 54th Massachusetts was the first African-American unit in the US Army. We see the formation of the regiment, its first volunteers, their training, disputes with administrators, their first operations in South Carolina and, finally, their moment of glory - the attack on Fort Wagner.Incredibly moving movie. The regiment is historical for its formation, for its attack on Fort Wagner and for how, through their courage, the regiment inspired many other African-Americans to enlist in the Union army, to the extent that about 180,000 African- Americans fought for the Union in the Civil War. We see the issues they had to go through, facing racial prejudice at every turn. We also get to feel how their existence symbolizes why the war was being fought, and what's at stake if the Union loses. A quite necessary movie, for the above reason and to show the part African-Americans played in the Civil War. Plus it conveys a strong tolerance and anti-racism message.Solid performance by Matthew Broderick in the lead role. Denzel Washington gives the stand-out performance, as Private Trip. He got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his efforts.Good support too from Morgan Freeman and Cary Elwes.",10,1,3,1 February 2016
Rocky II," Marginally better than the first movie
","Marginally better than the first movie. Not that this says much...Rocky is one of the most overrated movies of all time. Implausible plot, often dull and with some of the worst performances you'll see in a movie: from the over-the-top acting of Burgess Meredith to the monosyllabic, IQ-reducing grunts of Sylvester Stallone. Only Talia Shire was convincing.Only thing that made it watchable was the occasional humour, the introductory scenes and the final fight scene. Rocky II is more of the same. Human drama for 90% of the film, followed by an intense fight scene. This time, however, the human drama side is more realistic and engaging and the movie flows better for it. Still not great, as it all feels kind of predictable, but it is less dull than the first movie.",5,0,0,11 April 2015
Corpse Bride," Wonderfully original, ghoulish fun
","Victorian England and Victor Van Dort is about to marry Victoria Everglot. It is an arranged marriage - the two have never met before. At the wedding rehearsal Victor fluffs his lines and is told he needs to sharpen up, or the wedding's off. Victor sets about learning his lines - in a graveyard. In saying his vows he then accidentally commits himself to marrying a dead woman, the Corpse Bride.Written and directed by Tim Burton, this has all the trademarks of his handiwork: an original, quirky plot, a fantastical setting, brilliant animation and production and a catchy Danny Elfman- composed-and-performed score. Oh, and the cast includes Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, of course. Wonderfully fun and quite clever too. Some very funny lines and scenes.Voice casting is spot-on with a cast that includes, in addition to Depp and Bonham Carter, Emily Watson, Richard E Grant, Joanna Lumley, Tracey Ullman, Albert Finney, Christopher Lee and Jane Horrocks.Despite the ghoulish nature of the plot, ideal for children too. Quite innocent and fun.",8,0,0,28 December 2016
Lion," Okay, but weakened by a clumsily told, superficially melodramatic second act
","Northern India, 1986. Guddu and his younger brother Saroo help out their impoverished family by scavenging anything they can. One night Guddu and Saroo are separated at a train station. Saroo tries to find Guddu but ends up on a train that takes him to Calcutta, 1,600 kms away. In Calcutta he is taken in by a organisation that finds adoptive parents for orphans and lost kids. Saroo is adopted by an Australian couple, the Brierleys, and moves to Hobart, Tasmania. 20 years later he decides to find his mother and brother. Quite flat for something that should have been enthralling and emotional. Starts very well - the story of how Saroo was separated from his brother and ends up in Australia is well told and is very engaging.The movie, however, loses its way in the second act - where the 20- something Saroo first goes to Melbourne and then starts to look for his mother. The plot development here is incredibly padded, filled with empty, superficial melodrama and sub-plots that go nowhere, making for dull viewing. The search itself was interesting, but does not get much screen time and is diluted by the padding around it. There's also the fact that you know from the trailers and synopsis where this is all going. Trying to create an air of mystery around the course the plot is going to take is pointless when viewers already know the outcome.It all comes together, eventually. Ending is quite emotional.Ultimately, okay, but could have been really good with a tighter, shorter middle-to-late section.",6,3,5,6 May 2017
Forrest Gump," Schmaltzy and overly folksy, but works
","Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is a simple, slow-witted boy from the country. We see his life story, his simple home-spun sayings that get him through life and how he manages to nonchalantly participate in some of the most momentous events of the 1960s.Simple, but fun. Overly folksy and schmaltzy, but works. Not too profound but if you don't think too much, it's quite enjoyable. The weaving into the plot, and the footage, of actual historic events is wonderful to behold and adds a great comedic element to the movie too.Won the 1995 Best Picture Oscar, though certainly wasn't the best film of that year. The other nominees were fantastic: Pulp Fiction, Four Weddings and Funeral, The Shawshank Redemption and Quiz Show, yet the weakest of the five won the award. I guess the Academy wanted something sappy and simple, not something gritty or clever, to win.",7,1,3,3 February 2017
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Powerful silent era drama
","The trial and execution of Joan of Arc. Powerful drama. Starts rather tamely, and it seems like the movie could just be a back-and-forth dialogue between Joan and the judges / priests. However, the dialogue is spot-on, and the verbal jousting is wonderful to behold.Great direction by Carl Theodor Dreyer. His use of close-ups is a masterstroke, giving a great intimacy with and engagement to the character of Joan. Quite gritty, realistic direction too. Very graphic for 1926 - the last few scenes are incredibly harrowing.What makes the movie is the performance of Maria Falconetti in the lead role. Superb, conveying vast amounts of emotion and thought without saying a word. Surely one of the greatest physical drama performances in all of cinema.",8,1,3,3 April 2017
Gone Baby Gone," Meh
","Ben Affleck tries to recreate the emotion of Mystic River, and fails. It is not a coincidence that the only good thing about this movie is the plot - Dennis Lehane wrote both this and Mystic River.However, Ben Affleck is no Clint Eastwood, in any respect. I wanted to say he should go back to acting, but Mr Affleck sucks at that too. While Clint Eastwood creates a genuine empathy in his movies, Ben Affleck thinks that haunting music, long drawn out silences and mumbling lead actors will do the trick. Didn't work on me - I certainly felt no empathy with any of the characters.",4,1,3,16 May 2020

Its employees, being monsters, venture into children's bedrooms and scare them. Then one day, a child accidentally returns with a monster to Monstropolis, something which should never happen...Quite original story. Starts off in good fashion and is pretty good fun. However, after a point is really just one huge chase / caper movie and gets fairly predictable as a result. This is where adults will generally zone out (it was certainly where I started to lose interest) but kids should still enjoy it.Good voice casting, with John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi, James Coburn and Jennifer Tilly in the main roles.",6,0,1,17 October 2015
Southpaw," Great, and more than just a boxing movie
","Billy Hope (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) is the undisputed light- heavyweight boxing champion of the world. He is unbeaten over a career of 43 fights. He is happily married to beautiful Maureen (Rachel McAdams) and has a young daughter, Leila (Oona Laurence). His life seems perfect, but then, during a fracas with a rival boxer, his wife is shot and killed. They had known each other since they were 12 years old, and now the bottom has fallen out of his world. The death of his wife sends Billy into a downward spiral, resulting in him being barred from professional boxing for a year, the loss of his house and almost all his possessions and, most painfully, the loss of his daughter to the custody of Social Services. In order to gain back his daughter and restart his life, he seeks out a particular trainer, Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker). Now he is starting his life again, at the bottom.More than merely a boxing movie. Yes, it is about a boxer, has some great fight scenes and the climax is a fight, but it is more than that. It is about bouncing back and changing for the sake of the ones you love. Most tellingly it is about a father's love for his daughter and what he will do to get her back.This all said, the fight scenes are very impressive, and I'm not really a boxing fan. Very gritty and not the usual all glory-no pain or work you usually see in boxing movies. Jake Gyllenhaal is very convincing as Billy Hope, and clearly transformed himself for the role, making his performance even more authentic. On the downside, does feel a bit schmaltzy at times, and one or two turns of events do feel a bit contrived, but these are minor issues. In the end it is a great, emotional movie.",8,0,0,4 July 2016

American Hustle," Much more than a con-caper
","Excellent movie. Ostensibly a con-caper, it is so much more than that. Clever, and, most of all, wickedly funny. In fact, it is the humour that tips this movie from being good to being great.Writer-director David O Russell brings together the main cast from his last two movies, and they don't put a foot wrong.Christian Bale, as always, throws his entire life into his role, putting on several kilograms and going out of his way to look sleazy. Amy Adams is superb, as always. Bradley Cooper is solid in his role as the FBI agent. Stand-out performance, however, goes to Jennifer Lawrence. She gets the funniest lines and scenes and they seem to suit her perfectly. Her over-the-top, manic performance steals the show.(Bale and Adams were both in Russell's 'The Fighter', and Lawrence and Cooper were in his 'Silver Linings Playbook).Good support from Jeremy Renner, Louis CK, Jack Huston and Shea Whigham. Robert De Niro only appears for a few minutes but leaves lasting impression. Still as good as ever.Add in a superb, rockin' soundtrack, by now a given for a David O Russell movie, and this movie is a must-see.",9,0,6,2 March 2014
Incendies," Intriguing drama

This can be quite off-putting, as it looks like it is going to just be 2 hours of drifting.However, from a point it becomes a very intriguing mystery. Plus, it becomes an exploration of religious intolerance and the effect of civil wars on the civilian population. No punches pulled, the war scenes are searing and graphic.The conclusion is quite incredible in terms of unexpected, perverse twists.Not perfect though. As already mentioned, the start is slow, and feels padded. More importantly, some parts of the plot, especially towards the end, seem a bit forced and contrived. Not 100% plausible, ultimately.Still, a great movie. The intrigue just builds and builds.",8,1,4,18 April 2014
The Godfather: Part II," Great follow-up to one of the greatest movies ever made
","The continuation of the Godfather saga with two focuses: the ongoing story of the Corleone family, and Michael in particular, and Vito Corleone's (Michael's father) backstory. Regarding the ongoing Michael Corleone story, it is about seven years since the events that concluded The Godfather. With the murders of the heads of the other four New York / New Jersey families, the Corleone family has unassailable control in New York. The move to Nevada went smoothly and Michael Corleone controls several hotels and casinos in the state. Frank Pentageli, the man who runs Michael's interests in New York, comes to Michael, asking if he can take out the Rosato Brothers as they are infringing on Pentageli's turf and business interests. However, the Rosatos are backed by Hyman Roth, a business partner of Michael's and a long- time ally of Michael's father, Vito Corleone, and Michael refuses. An attempted assassination attempt is then carried out on Michael's life, in his own home. Michael investigates who is trying to kill him, and suspects that there is a traitor in his family. Meanwhile. Michael and Hyman Roth fly to Cuba to finalise some business deals there. The Cuban trip reveals all. In a story interwoven with the present day, we see the backstory to Vito Corleone. From how his parents and brother were murdered by a Don in their home town of Corleone in Sicily, to his escaping, as a boy, to New York, his adult life and his rise to Don Corleone.A great follow-up to one of the greatest movies ever made. Gritty, solid plot, superb direction by Francis Ford Coppola and excellent performances. The closing scenes are incredibly powerful, showing just how much Michael has changed from the innocent man we met at the start of the first movie.Six Oscar wins, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. Robert De Niro won a Best Supporting Actor for his performance as Vito Corleone, making two Oscar wins for two different actors playing the same character (Marlon Brando got a Best Actor Oscar for his performance in the first Godfather). Al Pacino, Michael V Gazzo, Lee Strasburg (of method acting fame) and Talia Shire also received acting Oscar nominations.Not quite in the same league as the first movie though. The first one had a much tighter plot and better pacing: this does feel a bit padded and slow at times. Not as enthralling and tension-filled as the first. Then again, we are comparing this movie to one of the greatest films of all time...",9,0,1,28 May 2016
Fargo," A masterpiece of light and dark by the Coen Brothers
","A masterpiece of light and dark by the Coen Brothers.Based on a true story, a car salesman in Minneapolis, MN, Jerry Lundegard (played by William H Macy) hires two criminals to kidnap his wife. Her father is wealthy and Jerry needs the money. However, things don't go according to plan and soon three people are dead outside of Brainerd, MN. The 7-month pregnant Sheriff of Brainerd, Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), is soon on the case, and she is very intuitive and resourceful...An amazing story, well told. Written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, the story itself shows how the most simple, very-limited-harm- intended crime can unravel, resulting in the deaths of several people.The execution is a work of pure art. The Coens mix incredibly dark plot lines and themes with a lightness and almost frivolity to produce a movie that is simultaneously deadly serious and very funny. There is violence aplenty and some quite disturbing scenes, mixed with folksiness, innocence and humour. In the midst of evil there is good, and vice versa.A haunting score and stunning cinematography add to the tone of the movie.Superb performance by Frances McDormand in the lead role. The Sheriff is an amazing character, an understated, modest hero, and McDormand nails the part. She well deserved her Best Actress Oscar. William H Macy is perfectly cast as the crooked car salesman and got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his performance.

There cannot be too many more convincing portrayals of psychopath/sociopaths out there. Incredibly intense, and very convincing. Good support from Rene Russo and Riz Ahmed, but it is really the Jake Gyllenhaal Show - he is in every scene. How he did not get a Best Actor Oscar nomination, I do not know.More broadly, how this movie got only one Oscar nomination (for Best Original Screenplay), I don't know.Only negative aspects of the movie is that it is a bit too neat, the way things pan out.

A pioneer in all these fields he was a man who had a massive influence on aeronautical advancement, the airline industry and the aviation industry in general plus gave the world some movies which helped the progression of that art form (in particular, Hell's Angels, Scarface and The Outlaw). Not content with being a highly successful and wealthy businessman, leading aircraft designer and movie mogul he even test flew his own aircraft! His private life was equally epic, having long-term relationships with Katharine Hepburn and Ava Gardner and dating almost every female star in Hollywood at some stage. But he wasn't without his faults, eccentricities and demons, and these are explored here too. A fantastic study of an incredible life. Master-director Martin Scorsese turns a linear biopic into an incredibly engaging, enthralling and illuminating journey. Despite being over 160 minutes long the time flies by, such is the pace, energy and interest of the movie. Hughes was a larger-than-life character and incredibly influential person on history and Scorsese shows him the respect he deserves. Not that he paints him as a saint though. He is portrayed as reckless at times and, as mentioned, his personal issues are also covered, and they are covered well. We see how his eccentricities and disorders - germaphobia and obsessive-compulsive disorder plus potentially other mental issues - have a large bearing on his life and work. We also see how he manages to go on despite these. Very sensitively and appropriately covered by Scorsese.Superb performance by Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead role. The movie got him his second Oscar nomination, and first for a leading role, and he was unlucky to lose out, having to compete with a brilliant performance by Jamie Foxx in Ray. Cate Blanchett is superb as Katharine Hepburn and well deserved her Best Supporting Actress Oscar (her first Oscar and her second nomination). Alan Alda got a Best Supporting Actor nomination for playing Senator Brewster.The remainder of the cast is star-studded too: John C Reilly, Kate Beckinsale (as Ava Gardner), Alec Baldwin, Jude Law (as Errol Flynn), Ian Holm, Danny Huston. Even the minor parts include Gwen Stefani (as Jean Harlow) and Willem Defoe and the musical numbers include Loudon Wainwright, Rufus Wainwright and Martha Wainwright!A masterpiece.",10,1,1,9 July 2016
Léon: The Professional," Brilliant, powerful story of revenge...and belonging
","Brilliant, powerful story of revenge...and belonging.Leon (played by Jean Reno) lives in New York and is a professional hit-man. One of his neighbours, Mathilda (Natalie Portman), is a 12- year old girl with family problems, one of which is that her father is a petty criminal. One day, a drug kingpin, Stansfield (Gary Oldman), kills her entire family due to something her father did. Mathilda turns to Leon for help...and revenge.Excellent crime drama. Good plot, meticulously set out and executed. Good action scenes too. Not just an action-drama though - there is also an emotional aspect to the movie, and a theme of setting down roots and belonging somewhere.Solid work by Jean Reno and Natalie Portman (12 years old and in her first movie) in the lead roles. Both these performances are eclipsed, however, by an amazing performance by Gary Oldman as the villain. Pure over-the-top, menacing, evil, bizarre genius of a performance by him. The only disappointment of this movie is that Oldman did not have more screen time.",9,1,1,7 March 2016
Oblivion," Much style, limited substance
","Much style, but limited substance. Great special effects and decent initial plot. Story looked set to be quite interesting.However, from a point it just becomes hard to follow. The plot seems to take twists for twists sake, not much is explained, and nothing much follows from before. It just...happens, without rhyme nor reason.Ending was a tad predictable, but then that wasn't really the ending (one of the many wtf moments I had during the movie). Tom Cruise does his usual action-hero stuff. Does it well, but it's nothing new. Olga Kurylenko is stunningly beautiful, as always, and puts in a decent performance. Morgan Freeman seemed to be on autopilot (I guess he sensed from the start this movie was hardly going to demand much of his considerable acting talents). Disappointing.",5,2,3,10 March 2014
Bohemian Rhapsody," Superb: engaging, entertaining and moving
","The story of rock band Queen, with particular emphasis on the life of their flamboyant, larger-than-life vocalist, Freddie Mercury.Superb. While being a fan of Queen, I wasn't sure how this would turn out. This movie could easily have turned into a conventional, linear telling of the Queen / Freddie Mercury story. For the first half it appeared that this was going to be the case: director Bryan Singer whizzes through their early history with the interest largely being sustained by the fantastic music.However, from a point the movie becomes highly engaging and quite moving. The music is still great but the characters have more depth and the band dynamic comes more to the fore. Moreover, the emptiness of Freddie Mercury's life and his diagnosis with AIDS are examined, making for a profound and emotional second half.Perfect ending too. Singer could easily have ended the movie with Mercury's death, which would have made for a sentimental yet predictable and down-beat conclusion. Instead he chooses the moment of Mercury's, and Queen's, greatest triumph, making for a joyous, positive ending. Rather than mourning Mercury's death, we're celebrating his life.Great performances all round. The problem with biopics is that either you often have to choose between actors who look the part, but then can't act, and good actors who don't look the part. Here there were no compromises: the actors can act and they look like their real-life characters.Superb performance by Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury, a performance that saw him win the 2019 Oscar for Best Actor. His teeth do steal the show though...",9,2,3,21 July 2019
Burn After Reading," Excellent follow-up to 'No Country for Old Men'
","How do you follow up a dark drama masterpiece like 'No Country for Old Men'? With an excellent comedy-drama, 'Burn after reading', and in a very short space of time. When most directors would be happy to take a break after making one of history's great movies, and winning 4 Oscars for the effort, the Coen brothers immediately get back in the studio and make a great quirky comedy-drama. Like they did after 'Fargo', with 'The Big Lebowski'. (Though I feel The Big Lebowski surpassed Fargo, while Burn after Reading doesn't beat No Country for Old Men).Great mix of comedy and drama, though sometimes the two do get a bit mixed up and you don't know whether to laugh or be shocked.Excellent performances from an all-star cast including George Clooney, John Malkovich, Frances McDormand and Tilda Swinton. Brad Pitt steals the show though, in his over-the-top performance as a hyper- energetic vacuous fitness dork.",8,1,3,26 January 2016
Watchmen," Goodish special effects, and that's about it
","Goodish special effects, and that's about it. Story drifts along for 160 minutes. I didn't feel particularly engaged by the movie, or entertained. Not boring, but not that interesting either.(And seeing Billy Crudup / Dr Manhattan's blue schlong in every second scene was a bit disconcerting!).For a great adaptation of a graphic novel, see Sin City instead.",5,1,8,13 March 2019
The Killing Fields," Interesting true story of friendship and survival, set against the backdrop of one of history's most oppressive regimes
","Interesting true story of friendship and survival, set against the backdrop of one of history's most oppressive regimes.Set against the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia in the 1970s, the true story of New York Times journalist Sydney Schanberg (played by Sam Waterston) and his Cambodian interpreter Dith Pran (Haing S Ngor). They are there in 1973 when Cambodia is a side-theatre of the Vietnam conflict. At this time the Khmer Rouge are on the rise but not a major threat. Then we jump forward to 1975 and the Khmer Rouge have the upper hand and are about to take control of the country. The US, and other countries, are evacuating personnel. Though both of them have an opportunity to leave too, Schanberg and Dith Pran decide to stay to cover what happens next. This will ultimately put Dith Pran's life in grave danger as the Khmer Rouge's reign over Cambodia was one of oppression and genocide.Interesting, though a bit dry. The movie starts very slowly and takes a very long time to find a second gear. Even when things do start to fall into place and you get to understand where the story is going, things still don't really move at more than a moderate pace. However, the last 40 minutes or so more than make up for this. We see the extent of the Khmer Rouge's oppression and atrocities, and the movie becomes a powerful, tense story of resourcefulness and survival. Great, emotional ending.Solid work by Sam Waterston as Sydney Schanberg. Haing S Ngor, a Cambodian doctor and refugee with no previous acting experience, gives a great performance as Dith Pran and well deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar. The cast also includes John Malkovich (in only his second feature film), Julian Sands (third feature film) and Craig T Nelson, all of which give fine performances.",7,0,0,11 May 2016
Baby Driver," Gritty and action-packed
","Baby is a young getaway driver, contracted to a master-criminal, Doc. Doc's specialty is armed robberies - he puts together teams for each heist, with Baby being the only constant. Baby completes his last job for Doc and is now free. He sets about leading a normal life, getting a legitimate job and starting a relationship (with Debora). However, Doc views Baby as a sort of good luck charm, and, using threats of violence, pulls him back into the criminal world. With a particular job in mind, Doc assembles his team. However, the other individuals are incompatible with each other, if not psychotic, and soon not only is Baby's life at risk but also Deborah's.A gritty, action-packed and entertaining drama from director Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Scott Pilgrim vs the World). Good script, with some characters that Tarantino would be proud of. Good action scenes, largely involving cars. The car-action does get possibly too much screen time though, starting to resemble Fast & Furious after a while (that's never a compliment...). Another negative is that it does feel too schmaltzy, especially the ending, which is quite weak in comparison with the remainder of the movie. Ansel Elgort is also a bit irritating as Baby (though not as irritating as he was in The Fault In Our Stars). Comes across as a nerd trying to be cool.Can't fault the supporting performances though. Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx and Lily James are great. Jamie Foxx is particularly impressive as the intense, paranoid, impulsive, psychotic Bats.",7,2,4,1 October 2017
The Matrix Revolutions," Dull and pointless
","Not a fan of the first movie, the second was worse, and this is even worse than that. As with the second movie, the whole plot just seems like an excuse for several well-choreographed but dull fight scenes in slow motion, complete with impossible moves and such. Very dull and pointless.",4,0,3,18 March 2018
Man of Steel," Meh
","Meh. The movie had potential but quickly degenerated into wall-to-wall mindless action sequences and CGI for the sake of CGI.Set up was good. The initial few scenes were interesting and actually had the makings of a great movie in itself. The Krypton back-story as a movie would be worth watching, given a good director (ie not Zack Snyder) and good writer.It was in the expansion of the story that the plot started to unravel. Scenes were just too neat and contrived. Need a moral lesson in something, oh, here we go, just such an incident happens. Then we come to last half, and easily the worst part of the movie. This is the part where you switch off your mind, because it is pointless action sequences and CGI. Pretty much Michael Bay-like crap.Even Amy Adams can't save this.",5,1,5,21 July 2014
Grease," Good musical drama
","Teenagers Sandy (played by Olivia Newton-John) and Danny (John Travolta) have a summer romance but that seems to be how long it will last. Then they discover that they now both attend the same high school...Good musical-drama. Basic plot, but the movie is made by the music. Catchy, and keeps the story moving along.Decent performance by John Travolta. Olivia Newton-John is weak and unconvincing in her role though. Supporting cast is solid, though casting in general is a major problem. Who thought casting 20-somethings as teens when they don't look anything like teens would be a good idea? Doesn't help the plausibility.",7,0,0,14 October 2016
The Caine Mutiny," Great drama
","Great naval, legal and psychological drama. Solid, believable and gritty plot. Has a bit of padding though - the romantic sub-plot was quite pointless and had no bearing on the main theme (though it does give May Wynn some screen time, and for that we are eternally grateful). Deft direction by Edward Dmytryk.A unique Humphrey Bogart performance in that he is not the perfect, aloof, cool hero. Here his character is far from perfect and is quite vulnerable. Certainly shows a depth and breadth to Bogart's acting ability that many people didn't know existed. Superb performance by Bogart.Good supporting performances from Van Johnson and Jose Ferrer. Robert Francis as Ensign Keith is a bit unconvincing and Fred MacMurray lays on the elitist, high-brow pretense a bit thick. As mentioned, May Wynn's role is unnecessary, but we don't mind seeing her...",8,0,1,23 April 2014
Cast Away," Much more than I expected
","(Spoilers)Much more than I expected. Disaster-adventure movies are generally quite predictable. Plot = disaster, survive, rescue. That's it. Hard to rate a movie highly that just follows that formula and has very little room to stray from it.That's what makes Cast Away so good. Yes, there are elements of that formula in it, but it has so much more than that. Director Robert Zemeckis carefully sets up the background of the lead character, especially the romantic angle. The survival part meticulously details how he works out how to survive, and how he survives. The movie doesn't end with a rescue, it goes beyond that, showing how the lead character has to restart his life.Great performance by Tom Hanks in the lead role. Good support from Helen Hunt, but the best supporting performance has to go to Wilson the Volleyball. Solid stuff...Not perfect. The ending feels like it was drawn out too much, and the director tried to make something profound out of the unprofound. The movie should have ended a few scenes earlier than it did.",8,1,2,16 March 2014
The Thing," A horror classic
","A US research station, Antarctica, early-winter 1982. The base is suddenly buzzed and attacked by a helicopter from the nearby Norwegian research station. They appeared to be trying to kill one of the dogs from the US base. Having dealt with the threat, the members of the US team fly to the Norwegian base, only to discover them all dead or missing. They do find the remains of a strange creature the Norwegians burned. The Americans take it to their base and deduce that it an alien life form. After a while it is apparent that the alien can take over and assimilate into other life forms, including humans, and can spread like a virus. This means that anyone at the base could be inhabited by The Thing, and tensions escalate.A horror classic. A well crafted story, directed by horror legend John Carpenter. He builds the plot well, meticulously setting the scene and ramping up the tension with good effect. The period where anyone could be infected / inhabited is particularly suspenseful. Excellent special effects, especially for 1982. Very gory, imaginative and realistic. Some of the images from the movie are quite iconic and will be familiar from pop culture, they've been reused so much.Ending is maybe a bit too ambiguous for my liking. While I don't generally like neat, happy Hollywood endings, this possibly went too much in the opposite direction. A greater degree of closure, or at least an indication of where the story was heading, was in order, I think.Solid performances all round. Kurt Russell is particularly good in the lead role, playing the quick-thinking action hero very well.",8,8,10,23 July 2016
Lilo & Stitch," Sweet, funny movie, ideal for all ages
","Sweet, funny movie, ideal for all ages.The story of a rather malevolent mutant alien that is banished from his planet. He then accidentally lands on Earth and befriended by a little girl who thinks he is a dog. Hijinks ensue, especially as his home planet has sent some people to recapture him.From the outset the movie is engaging and funny. Ends up making some good points re belonging, family and how people can change for the good. Meant for kids but has enough humour and emotion for adults to enjoy it too. Good voice casting, with the known names being Tia Carrere, Ving Rames and David Ogden Stiers. Daveigh Chase and and Chris Sanders do well as Lilo and Stitch, respectively.",7,0,0,11 July 2015
The Revenant," Interesting tale of survival and revenge
","Interesting tale of survival and revenge.Set in America in the 1820s, a frontiersman, Hugh Glass (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), is attacked and badly mauled by a bear. He is left for dead by his comrades. Meanwhile a group of Indians are after him. Thus starts his fight for survival and revenge...Loosely based on a true story, this is part drama movie, part action movie. Written and directed by Alejandro Gozalez Inarritu, who usually directs emotional human dramas which veer from interesting and profound (Ammores Perros, Birdman, Babel) to dull and pretentious (21 Grams, Biutiful), this is a bit of a departure for him. The dramatic touches - dream sequences, symbolism - are still there but the action side is new.And therein lies some of the problems with the movie. The drama, catering for his existing followers, seems, at times, overwrought and padded. Some of the dream sequences and flashbacks weren't entirely necessary.Then we have the action, there to cater for the short attention spans of Generations Y and Z. Some of it is good, and contributes to the movie, but some of it feels very clumsy and just action for the sake of it.This all said, the plot is interesting and engaging. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a good performance in the lead role. Tom Hardy is solid as the villain (though I would have preferred if he didn't try to make his voice so unintelligible). Superb scenery and cinematography.It does drag towards the end though, as Inarritu adds sub-plots and scenes that don't really add much. He slows the pacing down too. The final scene is inevitable and largely predictable.Overall: a good movie, but not a great one.",7,4,10,7 January 2016
Trouble with the Curve," Underwhelming
","Great cast but plot and direction are listless. Story just feels trite and predictable.Stand-out performance goes to Amy Adams. Clint Eastwood plays his usual curmudgeonly role, which is starting to feel a bit tired and predictable now. Good support from John Goodman. Justin Timberlake is Ok in his role.",5,1,1,31 December 2019
Bridge of Spies," Interesting but clumsy and a tad idealistic
","Interesting but clumsy and a tad idealistic.A European man living in the US, Rudolph Abel, is arrested as a Russian spy. An American lawyer, James Donovan, takes on his case but, faced with overwhelming evidence and a biased judge, loses the case. Abel is sentenced to 30 years in jail and Donovan's Supreme Court appeal fails. Just then Francis Gary Powers, the 'U-2 Spy', is shot down over Russia and captured. Now Donovan becomes the negotiator in a potential prisoner swap...Interesting story, especially as it is largely true and involves a very well-known historic event - the U-2 Spy. The negotiations and brinkmanship towards the end are quite intriguing.However, feels clumsy, idealistic and, at times, contrived. The first part of the movie deals very heavy-handedly with Abel's trial. The character of Donovan also seems too goody-two-shoesy to be the real Donovan.Certainly not Steven Spielberg's best direction - far from it. The movie seems to lack engagement and what there is is overly contrived and sentimental. Plus I quite quickly got irritated with his over- use of the last image of one scene being a segue to a new, unrelated, scene. Just felt very cheesy and amateurish.Being a Steven Spielberg film, we have Tom Hanks in the lead role. He puts in a fairly solid performance. Mark Rylance got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance as Abel. Not sure why - he doesn't have that much dialogue and his screen time is fairly limited too.",6,2,4,3 March 2016
Split," Not a return to form for M Night Shyamalan, but a step in the right direction, at least
","A man kidnaps three teenage girls and holds them prisoner in a basement. He has multiple personality disorder, and is the prize patient of Dr Karen Fletcher, who is using him as case study in the condition. Several of his 23 personalities make their appearance to the girls. While none of them seem particularly harmful, there are indications that there lurks inside of him an ultra-strong and violent personality, The Beast.Written and directed by M Night Shyamalan, I was hoping this would be a return to something like the form of his earlier films. Yes, it would be difficult to match the brilliance of The Sixth Sense but something approaching great would be a good start. Unfortunately his trajectory over the last 11 years or so has been decidedly downwards with some monumentally bad movies - The Happening, Lady in the Water and The Last Airbender (plus, probably, After Earth - I haven't seen it but apparently it is incredibly bad).So I was quite disappointed when I actually watched this, especially in the first half of the movie. Script, by Shyamalan, is weak, and padded. There was heaps of potential in the concept and themes but this is not used effectively.The biggest problem is that the initial plot is contrived and implausible. It hinges on you believing that the three girls would allow themselves to be held captive. They have plenty of opportunities to overwhelm the captor, but don't, and even when they actually figure on doing that we have a very weak and contrived reason for them not doing it.Plus there is a lot of padding to the movie. While the captor's visits to Dr Fletcher do add some depth to his character(s) and to her side of the story, much of it is unnecessary.So for the first half (even more) I was mostly sitting there thinking 'This is so unrealistic, just escape already!' and getting bored at some of the discussions.It gets more intriguing and exciting in the second half, and starts to make more effective use of the multiple personality device, but that doesn't make up for the poor start.Can't fault the performances though. James McAvoy is great as the captor, having to essentially play about nine roles, and have to switch between them in a heartbeat. Anya Taylor-Joy is solid as Casey, with good support from Betty Buckley, as Dr Fletcher, and Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula as the other two kidnapped girls.On the whole, not great, and certainly not in the same league as The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable or even The Village, but better than most of the stuff M Night Shyamalan has dished up over the last 11 years. A step in the right direction, at least.",5,6,9,13 November 2017
American Psycho," Superb
","Superb parady of the world of pretentious yuppies, and the pressures and effects of consumerism and having to maintain appearances. Based on the book by Bret Easton Ellis, it is fiendishly funny at times, yet simultaneously very realistic. Great acting by Christian Bale, in one of his first major roles.",9,1,2,30 March 2018
Coriolanus," There's a reason this is a lesser-known Shakespeare play...
","There's a reason this is a lesser-known Shakespeare play: the plot is pretty dull and pointless. Ostensibly a revenge movie, the movie starts very slowly and tiresomely. It sketches the background, Coriolanus' career and rise to power. After the reversal of fortune it looks like the movie is going to kick into another gear, and it does, briefly. After this temporary entertainment, it subsides with a whimper.I didn't mind the modern setting, and thought director Ralph Fiennes did a good job in modernizing the play. However, I also felt that some of the plot didn't translate well into the modern day, especially the speed of communication and news. (Aside: as a great example of how to modernize a Shakespeare play see Richard Loncraine's 1995 version of Richard III. Richard III is, however, a much more interesting drama to begin with...).The wordiness of it all (it is Shakespeare, after all) also slows things down, and doesn't help the dullness factor.Good performance by Ralph Fiennes in the lead role. Gerard Butler, whom I generally don't rate as an actor, puts in a fine performance as Aufidius. The most powerful performance, however, comes from Vanessa Redgrave as Coriolanus' mother.Good support from Brian Cox. Jessica Chastain seems a bit out of her element in a Shakespeare play.Hard to dislike Shakespeare, so this is a rarity.",4,3,9,15 August 2014
Hugo," Movie-history lesson wrapped inside a good drama
","Great movie. A movie-history-lesson wrapped inside a good drama. The central plot is great, and not at all predictable. Scorsese's influences and keen sense of all the great movie innovators that came before him shine through in the story. Scorsese's direction is its usual deft, clever self, and the special effects are great. The 3D effects were great, but not essential to the film (so not a problem if you can only see it in 2D).Not perfect though. Some of the sub-plots seem unnecessary, and dilute the focus. Asa Butterfield is OK, but not overly convincing, as Hugo. Sacha Baron Cohen is a bit subdued, even dull (by his standards), as the Station Inspector - possibly miscast. Remaining performances are fine though. Ben Kingsley doesn't do bad performances, and this is no exception. Good support from Emily Mortimer, Chloe Grace Moretz, Jude Law, Christopher Lee, Helen McCrory and Ray Winstone.",8,1,3,27 January 2015
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Not bad. Not that good either.
","Not bad. Not that good either. The third instalment of the Terminator franchise, and the first not directed by James Cameron. The change of director doesn't make much difference. As with the first two movies, it's all about style rather than substance, special effects rather than a watertight plot.Plot isn't that bad, however, just kind of formulaic. Performances are so-so. Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't there because for the Shakespearean soliloquies but just action scenes and cheesy one- liners, and he does those well. Nick Stahl is badly cast as John Connor - he's no action hero. Claire Danes' performance is the best of the bunch. Then again, she is easily the best actor in the cast. Kristanna Loken...looks good.Overall, not a terrible waste of time. Moves along at a good pace and it's a reasonably fun ride.",6,1,2,29 March 2014
U-571," Terrible
","The fact that the list of stars of this movie includes Bill Paxton and Jon Bon Jovi should be an indication that it is craptacular, and it is, very. Historically inaccurate with a plot filled with holes and contrived events. Acting and direction are woeful.

And then there is, of course, Jack Nicholson's perfectly controlled yet over-the-top-intense performance. Masterful.Good support from Shelley Duvall, but this really is the Jack Nicholson Show...A true classic.",9,3,6,7 April 2015
"I, Robot"," Decent sci-fi drama
","Decent sci-fi drama.Set in the year 2035, robots are commonplace and are becoming more and more sophisticated. A veteran cop, Del Spooner (played by Will Smith), is called in to investigate the apparent suicide of a friend and leading robotics expert, Dr Alfred Lanning (played by James Cromwell). He is quite cynical about robots and is convinced that a robot killed him. However, Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood), CEO of the corporation who designed and builds the robots, and that Dr Lanning worked for, isn't too happy with his investigations...Very intriguing, initially. Sort of a futuristic murder mystery, with a prime suspect a non-human. However, the movie does reveal its hand too soon, after which it is mostly just an action movie, unfortunately.Ultimately, entertaining enough. Just a pity the writer and director couldn't maintain the atmosphere of the first 30-40% of the movie and gave in to the temptation of making an action movie.Good performance by Will Smith in the lead role.",6,0,0,25 September 2015
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Despite the animation, still pretty much your average comic-book movie
","Miles Morales has just started at a new school and is struggling to fit in. Then he is bitten by a radioactive spider and he obtains certain powers, similar to those of Spiderman. He doesn't know what to do with the powers, or how to control them, so naturally he turns to Spider-Man for advice.Had some potential, initially, to be an original take on Spider-Man and comic book movies in general. The story doesn't follow Peter Parker, so is not the same Spider-Man story that's been told over and over before. Is animated, so original in terms of production (ironically, considering what comic book movies are based on...).However, despite these differences, it ends up being pretty much same old, same old: a linear, action-based story. Character development is token: everything is just a set up to get to the next action scene. Plot, what there is, is what you'd expect from a comic book movie: rambling, basic. Quite unengaging.Is fun at times, but certainly no more than your average comic-book movie.Hardly revolutionary, despite all the hype that says it is.",5,8,11,7 October 2019

He lives in the suburbs with his wife and teenage daughter and has worked in the same company for 14 years. Everything seems normal on the surface but Lester is starting to tire of the mundanity and superficiality of it all...Wonderful, thought-provoking, eye-opening story of suburban life: the materialism, the importance of appearances and status, the superficiality and the dullness and pointlessness of it all. Also covers other interesting topics like enjoying the simple things in life...and bigotry and intolerance.Makes you examine your own life, your motivations and what makes you happy.Superb performances too. Kevin Spacey is brilliant as Lester Burnham, as is Annette Benning as his wife. Good support from Thora Birch, Wes Bentley and Mena Suvari.Deservedly won the Best Picture award at the 2000 Oscars. Also picked up Best Director for Sam Mendes, Best Leading Actor for Kevin Spacey, Best Original Screenplay for Alan Ball plus Best Cinematography.

The relationship issues theme felt very well-worn and lame, and even quite token.Performances are okay, but nothing special. Nick Nolte got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his performance as the father, but I don't feel it was deserved. His role was very secondary (as per my 'token' comment) and he pretty much just had to mumble and ramble his way through.The thing that makes the movie watchable are the fight scenes.

","The country of Freedonia is in the middle of a financial crisis and on the brink of revolution. In order to gain a bail-out from the wealthy Mrs Teasdale, the government appoints Rufus T Firefly (Groucho Marx) as its president. However, Mr Firefly shuns the pomp and pretentiousness of government...and the prudence and rationality of it too. Meanwhile, the neighbouring country of Sylvania is plotting to overthrow Freedonia and sends Pinky (Harpo Marx) and Chicolini (Chico Marx) to spy on Firefly. War seems inevitable.Starring the Marx Brothers and viewed as a comedy classic, I was expecting great things from Duck Soup. However, while it has its moments, it was largely a disappointment for me.Having seen several of their previous movies, I knew what to expect. However, even then, this movie seemed quite silly. The others revolved around Groucho's quickfire wit and Chico and Harpo's slapstick comedy and Duck Soup is no exception. However, here it seems less clever than the best of the others, especially A Night At The Opera and A Day At The Races. Here, Groucho's witticisms wander into the territory of dad jokes and Harpo and Chico's clowning is often quite silly. The plot is okay, though not brilliant. Hardly the powerful anti- war and political satire movie it is made out to be.This all said, there are some great laugh-out-loud moments and these are enough to sustain the movie.",6,8,12,6 June 2017
Apocalypse Now," A masterpiece - one of the greatest movies ever made
","A masterpiece - one of the greatest movies ever made.Vietnam, 1967. An elite soldier, Captain Willard (played by Martin Sheen), is sent on a top secret mission to 'terminate with extreme prejudice' Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando). Colonel Kurtz is a US Army officer who has apparently gone insane and is fighting his own war from within Cambodia with an army of native soldiers. To find Kurtz, Willard sets off down the river on a patrol boat...Searingly brilliant. As a story alone this movie is fantastic. Superb plot with some iconic scenes (eg Ride of the Valkyries), great, quotable dialogue (eg Napalm in the morning, The Horror) and some very funny lines ('Charlie don't surf!').Director Francis Ford Coppola expertly builds the tension. The movie starts off quite light-heartedly - the first third or so of the movie is quite funny, especially anything involving Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall). It is actually over-the-top funny (eg surfing in the middle of a fire fight), which might seem strange but shows you the insanity of war and soldiers at war, and prepares you for what comes later.As the movie goes on it becomes much darker. Coppola slowly tightens the rope around the viewer's neck, until the intensity is suffocating. By the end you're in the middle of a nightmare, a hell on earth. This demonstrates the slow progression from balanced soldier to insane maniac.So many deeper issues tackled along the way: the duality of man, good vs evil, the morality of war and why the US lost in Vietnam. Excellent performances from Sheen, Brando and Duvall. Duvall received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his performance. Good support from a cast that includes Dennis Hopper, Harrison Ford and Laurence Fishburne.One thing: regarding the Redux version (the 2001 director's cut which included 43 extra minutes), its add-on scenes are of mixed value. Some are great - anything involving Colonel Kilgore / Robert Duvall is definitely a win as his character is comedy gold. Some parts of the French plantation scene are very useful, and give you a clue to where the US is going with the war and why they will lose it, but some of it feels like padding. The entire Medevac scene (with the Playboy bunnies) is unnecessary.So a bit hit-and-miss. Overall the extra scenes probably enhance the movie, slightly.",10,0,2,28 January 2016
Silver Linings Playbook," Good, but not great
","Good, but not great. Well-intentioned, but flawed. Starts off very interestingly and engagingly, with many amusing moments. However, the story becomes more trite and predictable the longer it goes on. Plus, the plot isn't water-tight.I was expecting something darker and more character-based, rather than light and plot-based.It's the great performances that lift this movie to above the average. Jennifer Lawrence deserved her Oscar, as did Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver their nominations.Not as good as I was expecting it to be, but not bad either.",7,1,1,29 December 2015
Van Helsing," Enjoyable...when it doesn't take itself too seriously
","Enjoyable...when it doesn't take itself too seriously.Vampire/werewolf/monster/whatever-hunter Van Helsing (played by Hugh Jackman) and his faithful sidekick Carl (played by David Wenham) go to Transylvania to track down Count Dracula (played by Richard Roxburgh). They end up in a town whose inhabitants are tormented by vampires. Among the town's leaders is a local vampire-fighter, Anna Valerius (Kate Beckinsale).Had heaps of potential...as a comedy. There are some great lines and funny scenes in the movie, and many of the them are thanks to Carl / David Wenham. Richard Roxburgh's great campy portrayal of Count Dracula is also wonderful - reminded me of The Rocky Horror Picture Show.However, the movie too frequently regards itself as a drama - even worse, an action-drama - and this is where it suffers. The dramatic plot is weak and the action scenes are dull and generic.So what you have are some great funny scenes interspersed with, and generally swamped by, dull action scenes. Very uneven.Overall, okay, but could have been so much better.",6,3,6,22 September 2015
Divergent," Inception meets Brave New World, but dumbed down for kids
","Inception meets Brave New World, but dumbed down for kids. You could also throw in a few other dystopian/post-apocalyptic movies and books that this is derivative of (not that Inception is such a movie, but the dreams-within-dreams scenes in Divergent reminded me of that).So, derive a plot from these books/movies, then dumb it down for kids. Hero(ine) is a teen. The good guys are the running, jumping, climbing, fighting types, not the intellectuals, or anyone else. (The perpetual running, jumping and climbing actually made the Dauntless people quite comical, rather than heroic, to me. Their whole shtick just seemed so lame). Throw in the usual underdog prevails against the odds and ultimately becomes a hero routine, with a bit of romance and an evil conspiracy by the adults/non-action types and you have your common-or-garden teen action movie. Only positive thing I can say about this is that at least it was better than The Hunger Games (but only marginally so). At least Divergent had some semblance of grit and edginess - Hunger Games is a like a Disney action-movie.",4,2,3,18 April 2015

Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Better than expected but still pretty bad
","Not as bad as I expected, but still pretty bad. Actually has a plot, which was the biggest surprise, and there is enough intrigue in it to keep the movie going. Rest is pretty silly: the modern technology and dialogue in a medieval setting, the predictable action sequences and over-the-top special effects.While Gemma Arterton and Jeremy Renner are good actors, they are miscast here. Both deserve something more serious, or polished at least. They both struggle to look convincing, as if they were going through the motions.

","Good, and about as good as the Swedish original. (And no, I am not one of those people who rail against Hollywood remakes of non-US movies. For example, I thought Infernal Affairs was great, but thought that The Departed was even better). Retains the grittiness and atmosphere of the original. Having seen the original previously, the plot was fairly second-hand, so the original diminishes the impact of this movie quite a bit. In fact - why remake it at all, as the plot is the same, and the original was so well done.Good performances by Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara in the lead roles.",7,2,4,4 February 2014
Rocky IV," From formulaic to silly
","From formulaic to silly.The first Rocky is one of the most overrated movies of all time. Implausible plot, often dull and with some of the worst performances you'll see in a movie.Only thing that made it watchable was the occasional humour, the introductory scenes and the final fight scene.Rocky II was more of the same. Human drama for 90% of the film, followed by an intense fight scene. This time, however, the human drama side is more realistic and engaging and the movie flows better for it. Still not great, as it all feels kind of predictable, but it is less dull than the first movie.Rocky III was even more of the same - the template has been created and was there to be used/abused.Rocky IV has the same plot - evil, seemingly unbeatable nemesis rises to take on Rocky, and the movie culminates in a long, intense fight. However, this time the nemesis is Russian and the Cold War is still on. Cue much patriotic chest-beating and a speech at the end. Lead-up to the final scene is quite silly.If you were a fan of the Rocky movies - and I certainly wasn't - and at some stage de-fanned, this movie would have been where you left the train.",3,0,4,12 April 2015
Dreamgirls," The Supremes deserve a lot better
","The Supremes deserve a lot better.Dreamgirls is largely based on the story of The Supremes, the ground-breaking Motown group. However, the movie does them no justice. All the music in the movie was written especially for the movie. So you don't have any recognisable 60s songs. Plus, the songs are quite dull and don't really capture the sound of the 60s or of Motown.Throw in a rather linear script and unimaginative direction and the movie is nothing special. Plus, in a movie filled with musical performances, the director has random music-instead-of-acting scenes, like in a musical. It just seemed like overkill and totally unnecessary.Decent performances though. Eddie Murphy got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination and Jennifer Hudson won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Not sure she deserved it though - she was good, but not THAT good. Then again, there wasn't much competition in that category in 2007.",5,1,2,13 April 2015
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Okay, but quite disappointing
","Okay, but quite disappointing. Had huge potential, and started out well - large degree of intrigue, and incredibly funny at times. Lost its way in the middle section - drifting aimlessly. Final section was worse - random, and tried to throw in some meaningless hippy philosophy to boot. It was as if the director, Grant Heslov, was trying to emulate the Coen Brothers in making a funny, quirky, snappy-dialogued yet clever-plot movie. He even recruits two Coen Brothers regulars - George Clooney and Jeff Bridges - to try to give it a Coen Brothers feel. Unfortunately, that is where the similarity ends. This is certainly no Coen Brothers movie. They don't ever lose focus.Good cast - George Clooney, Ewan McGregor, Jeff Bridges, Kevin Spacey - does their best, but their talents are wasted, through either being miscast, or due to the mediocre plot and direction. Clooney and McGregor are great in their roles, but Kevin Spacey is badly miscast. Strangely, Jeff Bridges seems miscast too. You would think the role suited him - the disheveled, loony hippy - very similar to The Dude in Big Lebowski. He seems strangely flat in the role, like he was trying too hard to be the loony hippy.Overall, the over-the-top humour and premise of the movie make it likable, though it could have been so much better.",6,1,3,2 December 2015
Shrek Forever After," Good fun
","Good fun. While this probably got the worst reviews of the four Shrek movies, I enjoyed this the most. The humour seemed cleverer, and the whole plot seemed darker and edgier. Maybe it was the fact that it had an over- the-top bad guy, Rumpelstiltskin, and he made the movie for me.Great graphics, and a decent, though a tad derivative, plot. The plot was never the main selling point of the Shrek series anyway...The old crew - Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy (especially) and Antonio Banderas - deliver in spades, but as, indicated before, it is Rumpelstiltskin, voiced by Walt Dohrn, who makes this so enjoyable.",8,1,1,14 May 2016
Dark City," Clever, highly original and intriguing drama
","A man, John Murdoch (played by Rufus Sewell), wakes up in the bath of his hotel room. He has no memory, not even of his name, and there is a dead prostitute in his hotel room. He then receives a phone call from Doctor Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland), telling him that some people are coming for him and he should leave immediately. He flees, becoming the prime suspect in a series of murders of prostitutes. On the case is Inspector Frank Bumstead (William Hurt). Bumstead is intrigued when Murdoch's wife, Emma (Jennifer Connelly) reports Murdoch missing. Meanwhile, it is clear that some strange people with special powers are after Murdoch. Turns out he has these powers too...A highly original, clever and intriguing movie. Starts with a film noir- like feel but develops into a sci fi movie too. A sort of film noir-sci fi drama. Very gritty, edgy, dark (literally and figuratively) feel with an intelligent, unpredictable plot.Good special effects too.Solid work by Rufus Sewell in the lead role with good support from William Hurt, Jennifer Connelly, Kiefer Sutherland and Richard O'Brien (of Rocky Horror Picture Show fame). Supporting cast also includes Ian Richardson and Colin Friels, plus Melissa George in her first big screen role.",9,2,4,13 June 2016
Dunkirk," Engrossing, immersive war drama
","May/June 1940. 400,000 British soldiers are holed up in the French port town of Dunkirk. The only way out is via sea, and the Germans have air superiority, bombing the British soldiers and ships without much opposition. The situation looks dire and, in desperation, Britain sends civilian boats to try to evacuate the beleaguered forces. This is that story, seen through the eyes of a soldier amongst those trapped forces, two RAF fighter pilots and a group of civilians on their boat, part of the evacuation fleet.Engrossing, immersive war drama. Hooks you from the word go and keeps you hanging on to the very end. Great action scenes with stunning visual and sound effects - very realistic. The sound of the Stukas diving is chilling.Quite a departure for director Christopher Nolan. Clever fictional dramas (eg Memento, The Prestige, Inception, Interstellar) tend to be his forte and an historical war drama seems, on paper, too constraining for his imagination. Yet, he pulls it off with aplomb, and uses his talent for mind-games in doing so. The three separate stories operating at different times and eventually syncing provides the alternative to what would otherwise have been a linear, less interesting story.Not perfect though, and certainly not in the same league as the masterpieces among war movies - eg Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan, Tora! Tora! Tora!, Full Metal Jacket, Cross of Iron, Das Boot, Platoon, The Deer Hunter. Some plot developments and actions seem implausible and dumbed-down for a wider, more ignorant audience, and to simple make for greater drama. Tom Hardy's endless supply of ammunition (and 5 kills, including one while gliding) was a touch laughable. Rifle fire being able to penetrate the metal hull of a ship was interesting too...Allied with this, the movie is not as gritty as it could have been. Yes, we see death and destruction everywhere, but some things seem straight out of the book of Hollywood war movie clichés. In addition, the characters aren't that engaging - this is definitely a plot-driven drama, despite focusing on a handful of characters.Not a masterpiece, but very good nevertheless and certainly worth watching.",8,4,8,21 July 2017
Cross of Iron," Peckinpah's WW2 masterpiece
","Peckinpah's WW2 masterpiece.1943. Stalingrad has fallen and The German Army is being pushed back on the Eastern Front. Nowhere is the situation more dire for the Germans than at the Kuban Bridgehead / Taman Peninsula. Here we see the war through the eyes of a platoon of German reconnaissance troops. Their senior NCO is a grizzled, resourceful veteran, Corporal Steiner (played by James Coburn). He is unconventional, insubordinate and irreverent, but the regiment's commander, Colonel Brandt (James Mason), tolerates this as he gets results. However, his company has a new commanding officer, the inexperienced Captain Stransky (Maximilian Schell). Stransky is a by-the-book, authoritarian aristocrat and him and Steiner are bound to clash. Moreover, Stransky is obsessed with winning the Iron Cross.Directed by Sam Peckingpah (Straw Dogs, The Wild Bunch, Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid), this is Peckinpah's Magnum Opus. Very gritty and realistic portrayal of war. Shows perfectly the chaos, terror and desperation of battle - the perfect maelstrom of war. Through the characters we see the different soldiers you meet in a war - the tough, resourceful ones, the political operators, the fanatics, the scared recruits, the paranoid ones, the realists. This gives a great insight into how different people, even on the same side and in the same unit, can view the same war. These characters also provide a commentary on war - it's pointlessness, hopelessness and wastefulness. Peckinpah rams this home with some very tense and graphic battle scenes. His camera work and editing are particularly impressive, conveying well the life-or-death struggle that is being carried out, as well as the randomness of injury and death.Like most Peckinpah movies its a bit rough around the edges. There are some continuity gaps, military inaccuracies and a few plot points aren't entirely sound. However, none of these are major and, if anything, the looseness of the production contributes positively to the movie. The lack of polish adds to the grittiness. Good work by the entire cast. James Coburn is solid as Steiner, as is James Mason as Colonel Brandt. Good support by David Warner as the war-weary, cynical Captain Kiesel. Pick of the bunch is Maximilian Schell who is perfect as the cold, scheming, manipulative Captain Stransky.A classic and one of the greatest war movies ever made.",10,2,3,9 May 2016

","Incredibly original and engrossing psychological drama. Very clever and ultimately very emotional. The only negatives would be that some of the clues are a bit too obvious, though a few smokescreens are thrown up to attempt to disguise them.Superb performance by Christian Bale. He clearly threw himself into the role, losing an incredible amount of weight to look the part (similar to what he would later do for Rescue Dawn). The only problem with casting him is that the plot has similarities to American Psycho, which he starred in, so this seems like a sequel or a remake.Good support from Jennifer Jason Leigh.",9,1,1,7 February 2016

At the restaurant he strikes up a friendship, and cooking partnership, with the garbage boy, Linguini.The movie started very well: interesting characters, especially among the rats, and some good, fun scenes. However, from a point (that point being roughly where Remy discovers how he can control Linguini) it gets silly and contrived. Any engagement with the characters disappears and the movie becomes quite dull.

Dallas Buyers Club," Great movie
","Great movie. Moving in its take on homophobia, intolerance and ignorance and damning in its take on government regulation, rigidity, corruption and stupidity. The big drug companies don't come out of this unscathed either.The most powerful and moving aspect, however, is the transformation of an everyman into a champion for the greater good. (Admittedly, however, his motives were also commercially driven). While some people might have let their circumstances overwhelm them, he fought back.Superb performances by Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto. McConoughey's role was the bigger one but Leto's was tougher (and, to a certain extent, possibly more fun!). Both of them had to make significant changes to their physical appearance for their role.If ever somebody doubted McConaughey's abilities as an actor, this will put them to rest. Certainly, his 90s-to-mid-2000s roles relied mostly on his physical appearance and were more style than substance (A Time to Kill was the exception) but with his last few roles (this and True Detective especially) he has shown himself to be an actor of substance. Supporting cast are OK, but not great. Jennifer Garner is the weak link in the cast. Not terrible, but she just doesn't seem to have the right presence or believability. Hillary Swank would have been a lot better for the role (and was originally cast, apparently, but had to pull out due to a scheduling conflict).The only negative is that certain details, important to the plot, seem glossed over. I sometimes felt like a major moment had too little lead- up or background. More detail, even if it made the movie 30 minutes longer, would have been welcome.",9,5,6,17 February 2014

Great acting too, especially by Sam Riley as Ian Curtis. Only negative thing I have to say about it is that the pacing was bit slow, esp in the latter half to quarter of the movie.Another great movie to watch re Joy Division is '24 Hour Party People'. This covers the Manchester music scene of the late 70s to early 90s, as seen through the eyes of Tony Wilson, the founder of Factory Records, Joy Division's record company. Bands covered include Joy Division, New Order and Happy Mondays, amongst others. Rate that movie even higher than Control, from a music history point of view.",9,1,1,9 June 2014

Also had a fair amount of intrigue, especially due to the changing of history angle.The movie managed to maintain focus and keep the plot tight, until about halfway through. Then, slowly but surely, the cracks began to appear. People behave in random ways, things happen that make no sense, and it all seems that these are just plot devices to prolong the movie.The final confrontation makes very little sense at all, and neither do the effects of it.However, great CGI, obviously, and solid performances all round.",6,4,5,20 April 2015

Captain America is convinced of his innocence, Tony Stark is convinced that he is guilty. This sets the two against each other, with the other Avengers choosing sides.I'm not a fan of comic book movies, though did enjoy the three Iron Men movies and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The better ones have more to offer than just your usual CGI-action. Unfortunately, this is not one of those. Pretty much CGI-action and nothing else, made for the kids who wonder who would win in a fight between Iron Man and Captain America.Basic plot, with new super heroes introduced simply because the producers can.

When his magical case is switched with that of an everyday, non- magical citizen, adventures ensue.A prequel to Harry Potter, and I'm not a Harry Potter fan. This said, the movie initially seemed to have a decent, intriguing plot, so I had hopes for something good, well, better, more substantial, than Harry Potter.Alas, it was not to be.

Even once the full picture is revealed, there are still a few good twists and blindsides.The second saw movie was more like what I was expecting - gratuitous gore and violence. Plot is more basic, almost token, and really just a vehicle to get to the next pointless gory scene.Saw III is more of the same, just worse and even more gratuitous. The plot is just an excuse for one gratuitous gory scene after another.

Animation is so-so. Has the look and feel of kids TV series I saw in the 70s and 80s.I really don't know what the fuss is all about. If you want a great animated movie, ideal for all ages, watch 'Up' instead. The Toy Story series (esp #3) would work too.How on earth this got into the IMDb Top 250, and, even more, the top 40, I do not know.",5,5,14,12 April 2015
Duck You Sucker," The best of Sergio Leone
","Sergio Leone's best film, in my opinion. That doesn't say much, though to some it might. In my opinion the four movies he is most famous for - Once Upon a Time in the West, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More - are okay but are vastly over-rated. Slow, badly produced, with holey plots, ridiculous dialogue and hammy acting, especially by the supporting cast. The only things preventing those from being total failures was the action scenes and, in three of them, the acting of Clint Eastwood.A Fistful of Dynamite is better in all those respects, without compromising on the action. Decent plot, though not entirely watertight. There's even a few nice themes running through it. Themes of patriotism, family, loyalty and camaraderie.Dialogue is OK. Has some silly moments but mostly fine.Performances are fine. Rod Steiger and James Coburn put in solid performances in the lead roles and the supporting cast don't embarrass themselves.Production is still reasonably cheap though. You get the usual effect of it appearing as if the actors voices have been dubbed in, rather than being recorded live.This is also shorter than those four, which is a blessing. There are still some pointless and/or drawn out scenes but these are more limited in number than the other four. Helps the pacing of the movie too.The main issue with this one is the fact that the soundtrack consists of one song and that seems to be on an infinite loop...Ultimately a very engaging and entertaining western.",8,2,5,24 January 2015
Underground," Superb - absurdly funny yet dark, gritty and profound
","Belgrade, 1941. Germany has invaded Yugoslavia. In the aftermath of the fall of Yugoslavia, two friends Blacky and Marko organise a residence, attacking German supply trains and depots and stealing weapons from the Germans. After a few years their operation moves completely underground and consists of manufacturing weapons. Marko is the only member of the resistance movement who gets to go to the surface. When the war ends, due to the economic and status benefits to him, he fails to tell the others that the war has ended... Brilliant movie from director Emir Kusturica. For the large part this is a comedy - some wonderfully absurd scenes and dark humour. Some of the scenes are straight out of the Charlie Chaplin playbook - clever, over-the-top physical humour. Add in a rollicking horn- filled soundtrack and you have a mood that is light and a pace that is quick. However, it is not all comedy - far from it. There is always a dark element to the film, including showing graphic war scenes in the middle of joyful scenes and slapstick comedy. The early-film sequence of a zookeeper lovingly feeding his animals, followed by the Germans bombing the zoo, leaving dead and maimed animals strewn across the screen, followed by an escaped elephant stealing a man's shoes, is a great example of this. This does well to show the absurd nature of war.Think Terry Gilliam meets Charlie Chaplin, with killing.In addition, beneath the absurdist humour lies a simmering theme of nationalism and betrayal. This all comes home to roost in the final era of the film, as the movie closes the loop and some great profundities are revealed. A movie that is sure to stick in your head, no matter what you think of it.",10,4,5,8 April 2017
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Good fun
","Good fun. Plot is quite basic but direction and special effects are very original and entertaining. Snappy, funny dialogue - screamingly funny at times. Does run out of steam and idea though, and should have ended about 20 minutes earlier.Good performances all round. Michael Cera does his usual nerdy low-self- confidence routine, and does it well. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is spot-on and gorgeous as the love interest. Supporting cast are well chosen - Anna Kendrick, Kieran Culkin, Jason Schwartzman, Alison Pill, Mark Webber, Ellen Wong.",7,4,6,20 March 2014
The Usual Suspects," Brilliant, clever thriller
","Brilliant, clever thriller.A ship in a harbour is torched and scores of people, crew and others, killed. There are only two survivors of the massacre. One is in hospital and badly burned. The other is a cripple named Verbal Kint, a minor member of a gang that formed by chance some time before...A searingly brilliant thriller with one of the best, most unforeseen twists in movie history. Great set up, clever plot progression and ingenious use of narration. Edge-of-your-seat sort of stuff, with nothing being given away until the very end.The script is so good it won writer Christopher McQuarrie an Oscar.Excellent performance from Kevin Spacey, good enough to win him his first Oscar. Good performances too from Gabriel Byrne, Chazz Palminteri, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollack and Stephen Baldwin (the latter two surprisingly so).",10,0,1,11 January 2016
Inside Out," Sweet movie on growing up, making memories and dealing with change
","Riley is an 11 year-old girl. We see her growing up and how her inner thoughts and emotions develop and control her, especially her memories. These thoughts and emotions are represented by miniature versions of her, and live in their own little world, controlling Riley from behind a console. Everything is going well and Riley seems to be leading a blissful, uncomplicated existence. Then she and her parents move home, from Minnesota to San Francisco, and the bottom falls out of Riley's world.Sweet movie on growing up, making memories and dealing with change. Funny, fun, emotional and reasonably clever. Had the potential to be incredibly profound and intelligent but pulls its punches in that regard. While it does touch on some interesting aspects of the human psyche, it doesn't really explore the subject deeply. Instead we have silly chase scenes and the like.I guess the problem is that the movie's main target audience is children and an illuminating, deep exploration of human thinking and emotions would be too complex for them.Overall: enjoyable, with some good intellectual and emotional moments, but uneven, as these moments are interspersed with bland, even silly, adventure-type scenes and plot-lines.",7,2,18,30 April 2016
The Duchess," Okay
","Good, for the most part, but the ending was a damp squib.

The Commitments," Wonderfully funny and entertaining with a fantastic soundtrack
","Dublin, Ireland. Local entrepreneur Jimmy Rabbitte is putting a band together (which he will manage). Through friends, contacts, auditions and blind luck he puts together his band - The Commitments. He decides what music they will play - soul. We see how the pieces come together, the auditions, the skepticism from his parents, their first rehearsal, how things start to come together and their first few gigs. We also see the relationships in the band, particularly the friction. Soon they are standing on the threshold of stardom.Wonderfully funny and entertaining with a fantastic soundtrack.Great plot, based on a book by Roddy Doyle, showing how the average band forms and develops and the internal turmoil. Wonderful dialogue and scenes - incredibly funny, with quotable lines coming thick and fast. However, the thing that tips the movie over from great to masterpiece is the music. Fantastic music, well made and produced with some great concert scenes to add to the vibe. Performances from a cast of then-unknowns are spot-on. Great casting, as director Alan Parker would have been going out on a limb with many of them. Wonderfully vibrant and funny, yet profound, movie.",10,1,2,22 May 2016
Gone with the Wind," Every bit the classic
","Georgia, early-1860s. Scarlett O'Hara's life is one of parties and romantic machinations. She lives on her family's plantation Tara and the love of her life, Ashley Wilkes, has just announced his engagement to Melanie Hamilton. However, she soon is married to Charles, Melanie's younger brother, though she doesn't love him. Then the Civil War intervenes, and once the South starts losing, survival becomes the priority. All this time, one man keeps popping back into Scarlett's life, the dashing Rhett Butler.Every bit the classic and epic it is made out to be. Epic in its span of events, epic in its running time, epic in its scale, epic in production. Interesting, engaging story that is part romance, part war drama, part triumph of the will drama, all with a few good themes thrown in.Has given cinema some of its most enduring scenes and lines.Won the Best Picture Oscar in 1940. Won 7 other Oscars too including Best Director for Victor Fleming, Best Actress for Vivien Leigh and Best Supporting Actress for Hattie McDaniel, the first African- American to win an Oscar (also the first to be nominated).",8,5,8,29 January 2017
The Butterfly Effect," Heaps of potential wasted
","Had heaps of potential, with an interesting central concept. However, the movie degenerates into populist, movie-for-the-masses schlock. The presence of Ashton Kutcher should give away the fact that this is nothing more than a B-grade movie.",4,1,6,17 May 2019
Legends of the Fall," A movie of two halves...
","Perplexing movie, as it is essentially a movie of two parts, and the two parts are vastly different in quality. The earlier part is boring, with a drifting, random plot and some incredibly cringeworthy acting by Brad Pitt ('overacting' understates it!). The WW1 scenes are particularly unrealistic and style-over-substanceHowever, just when you've given up on the movie, it all starts to come together. A revenge thread is added, which makes for some of the more intriguing scenes in the movie. The family-drama thread also comes together, at last. Similarly, Brad Pitt's performance becomes more convincing.Would have been a pretty good movie if the first 45-60 minutes had been slimmed down and the plot tightened up.",5,1,2,22 December 2015
No Country for Old Men," Modern masterpiece
","The Coen Brothers rank amongst my favourite writers/directors, regardless of whether they are doing comedy (Big Lebowski, Raising Arizona, The Hudsucker Proxy, O Brother Where Art Thou?) or drama (Fargo, Millers Crossing, Barton Fink, The Man Who Wasn't There). This is a Coen drama but if there is a Coen-drama formula, they have just redefined it, and indeed potentially rewritten how all thriller-dramas are written and directed. One of the most original movie structures and plots I have seen, up there with Memento in terms of innovativeness. Truly a modern masterpiece.",10,1,2,19 April 2014
District 9," Highly original and very watchable, even if you're not into sci fi
","A very rare sighting indeed - an innovative and original sci fi movie, that is well written, well directed and well acted. And this is it. Extremely original. Great plot, which constantly channels your thoughts in one direction, only to wrong-foot you. Good direction, from an unknown director. Graphics are great, which is a given for a modern movie, but here the graphics are more subtle and take a backseat to the storyline, unlike the Michael Bay/James Cameron school of in-your- face all-style-no-substance direction.Great, gritty, natural acting from a cast of unknowns. With The Hurt Locker probably the most under-hyped and (pre-release) under-rated movie of 2009.Even if you don't like sci fi, watch this.",8,0,1,5 October 2017
Mamma Mia!," The only good thing about this movie is the music...and Amanda Seyfried
","The only good thing about this movie is the music...and Amanda Seyfried.A girl, played by Amanda Seyfried, is getting married. She doesn't know who her father is and invites to the wedding three men whom she suspects one of is her father. Cue song and dance, all set to ABBA music.Incredibly cheesy and lame. Plot is very basic and the characters and/or performances are mostly ridiculous. Julie Walters' character has to be one of the most irritating in cinematic history. So bad I can't believe great actors like Meryl Streep, Colin Firth and Pierce Brosnan agreed to appear in this. What prevents this from being a total cringefest and bore is the music. (Well, most of it - some of it isn't great - depends on the singer - see later). Just the fact that the music was originally by ABBA creates a large sense of nostalgia (well, with me, at least). Plus, the original songs are great. In the movie, they're generally good, but there are a few exceptions. Pierce Brosnan really shouldn't sing, yet he does, and on more than one song...The only other plus is Amanda Seyfried. Great performance by her - charming, sweet and engaging. Very nice to look at too...",3,2,3,15 July 2015
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Deterred by the dullness of the first one
","Saw the first one, and that was enough. Plus, the Lord of the Rings trilogy should have prepared me for this: stunning visual effects but not much else. Long rambling linear story, filled with nick-of-time savings from death by randomly introduced forces. Plus, goes on forever, and you have to get through three of these before you get a conclusion (screw that!). Yep, pretty much Lord of the Rings all over again.At 9 hours or so in total, this series of movies will go down in history as the first time ever a book was quicker to read than the adapted movie was to watch...However, kids will love it (though the movie's length may hinder that), as will nerds.",5,4,7,26 January 2014
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Good but slow and unfocused
","The story of notorious outlaw Jesse James, concentrating on the last seven months of his life. Looks at how he is befriended by Robert Ford and how this will lead to his death.Good acting and decent script but very slow moving, resulting in a 2 hr 40 min movie. Could have been an hour shorter and still achieved the same result. The story meandered and digressed a lot in the middle section, spending much time on subplots which didn't have much bearing on the main story. Thought that the story of Robert Ford's post-assassination life could have been expanded more, though. The little post-assassination story that was shown, saved the movie, I feel.",7,0,0,10 November 2016
Batman Begins," Good start to the trilogy
","Rewatched this, after watching The Dark Knight Rises. Actually enjoyed this more the second time round. First 2/3rds are great, and is probably the best portion of the entire Batman trilogy. Sketching Bruce Wayne and Batman's history made for very intriguing viewing.However, the final few scenes are standard superhero action fare, and is fairly boring by comparison. The sub-plots involved in the final few scenes just seem quite lame compared to what came before. Overall, it is a toss-up between this and The Dark Knight as to which is the best of the three movies. Would easily have been this, until the final few scenes.Great special effects, as you would expect. Good performances all round. Pity Katie Holmes couldn't come back for the second movie...",8,0,1,21 March 2014
The Fault in Our Stars," Superficial and dull, despite the topic
","Superficial and dull, despite the topic.A story of a relationship between two teens who both have terminal cancer. Should be an engaging and emotional tale, but is strangely empty. Just feels like a paint-by-numbers midday TV movie, complete with one-dimensional, stereotypical characters and Disney-like lack of grittiness. Had potential initially, but quickly just fell into a pattern of silly sub-plots and style over substance. Ultimately doesn't go anywhere new and ends quite predictably, and inevitably.Has its moments though, and poses some questions regarding life and death. Good performance by Shailene Woodley. She is one of the few bright lights in the movie. Ansel Elgort overacts and is irritating. Similarly, Laura Dern. Willem Dafoe provides the only touch of edginess in the movie, but his performance feels a bit forced.Really a death and faux emotion movie for teenagers.",5,2,3,29 April 2015
Wreck-It Ralph," Original movie, and not just for kids
","Original movie, and not just for kids. Very novel plot - arcade game characters have a life, away from the video game. With this as a background, the plot lends itself to many adventures, some in-game and some not.Mainly a kids movie. The plot is a tad overly sweet and harmless. However, there are many emotional moments which will appeal to adults. Plus, some jokes and scenarios only adults would understand (not dirty, just do rely on knowing more about life and the world).John C Reilly is perfectly cast as the voice of Wreck-it-Ralph. Come to think of it, every voice is spot-on. I couldn't think of anyone who would suit Fix-it Felix more than Jack MacBrayer. Similarly, Sarah Silverman and Jane Lynch are great as Vaenellope and Calhoun respectively.Good, clean fun.",7,0,1,20 March 2014
To Rome With Love," Woody Allen's worst movie
","Weak, and quite silly. Probably Woody Allen's worst movie. The stories were mostly incoherent, and farcical. The only one which was meaningful was the Roberto Benigni one, with its examination of everyone having their 15 minutes of fame plus stardom, it's perks, downsides, superficiality and fleetingness. Others are mostly quite dull and meaningless, though they all have their moments.All-star cast does the best it can with the rambling script. Penelope Cruz was the stand-out, and not necessarily for her performance (that red dress...).Setting is amazing, of course. However, this is possibly a smokescreen on Woody Allen's part. His last few movies have all involved stunning European locations, as if the movie is more a travel guide than a drama. (Midnight in Paris wasn't bad though).",3,1,4,17 February 2014

Before Sunset," Great, and more substantial than Before Sunrise
","Great movie, and more substantial than Before Sunrise. I thought Before Sunrise was okay, but overrated. It was pretty much another romantic drama. Better than most in that it has more depth of characters, has a fairly unique and beautiful setting, and direction and plot are more subtle and original than most. On the down side, it was very dialogue-intensive and some of the dialogue is just incredibly pretentious, navel-gazing stuff. Before Sunset is still very dialogue-intensive. This is still an irritation in that you want some respite from this, some period of reflection and calm. However, in this case it does propel the story forward, unlike Before Sunrise where the dialogue seemed to go in circles and not really go anywhere.That is where Before Sunset is so much better. By setting it nine years after the first movie, you get a a more complete story, more character development, more a sense of what they mean to each other, more genuine emotion.For these reasons, making this sequel is a stroke of genius on Richard Linklater's part. Instead of a snapshot of these two people's lives, we have a timeline, a sense of lives progressing and changing, of memories and regrets. Not ships passing in the night (as the first movie made them out to be), but soulmates.",8,1,1,8 November 2014
The Princess Bride," Wonderful, heart-warming movie
","Wonderful, heart-warming story. Basically a fairy tale, but with some 20th century sensibilities and witticisms. Very funny at times. Some great, and quotable, lines.Rob Reiner's direction is spot-on. Never a dull moment - the movie just motors along and you hardly feel the time pass. Good performances all round. Cary Elwes, Robin Wright and Mandy Patinkin don't put a foot wrong. Hard to single out any, but Mandy Patinkin's, as Inigo Montoya, is probably the pick of the lot.It's not just the main characters who deserve our attention. Some big names in minor roles, and they all deliver in spades - Peter Falk, Fred Savage, Billy Crystal, Carol Kane, Peter Cook, Mel Smith.A modern classic and ideal for all ages.",10,3,5,12 January 2014

In the next few days these 150 troops will fight about 4,000 Zulus in one of the most courageous battles in history.Superb movie. Based on actual events with a few dramatisations along the way. Stirring stuff, showing well the courage and heroism shown on both sides. Militarily accurate too.Solid performances by Stanley Baker and Michael Caine in the lead roles. This was Michael Caine's first starring role in movies and the role that launched his career.",9,3,3,6 March 2017

Private James Ryan, a paratrooper in the 101st Airborne Division, is somewhere in the interior of Normandy and the US high command want him found and brought back safely. In the last week three of his brothers have been killed and he is the sole surviving son in the family.Incredible movie by Steven Spielberg. As a war movie it is the most realistic and gritty movie you'll ever see. The Omaha Beach scenes are the most accurate and graphic depiction of battle ever committed to celluloid. Militarily correct in every way.Great plot, with a great message. Very emotional at the end.Great work by Tom Hanks as Captain Miller. Good support from Matt Damon, Tom Sizemore, Ed Burns, Barry Pepper, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg and Jeremy Davies. Ted Danson, Dennis Farina and Dale Dye appear in minor roles. Even has some big names in pre-star days: Vin Diesel, Bryan Cranston, Nathan Fillion, Paul Giamatti.",10,1,5,14 April 2017
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Great...in spells
","Great...in spells. Also quite dull in spells. Broad feel of the is typical Wes Anderson: quirky, whimsical, sentimental, sometimes funny. However, here he is unable to sustain the interest and continuously engage the audience throughout. Some parts just drift.Set up and initial development are great, as is the conclusion. It is the third quarter or so where things get tedious and uninteresting. Essentially the movie becomes a silly common-or-garden chase movie. Performances are great. Ralph Fiennes was perfect for the lead role and carries the movie with aplomb. Tony Revolori does well as the Lobby Boy, Zero. Supporting cast is star-studded, include many Wes Anderson regulars and don't put a foot wrong: F Murray Abraham, Jude Law, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, Jason Schwarzman, Willem Dafoe, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Jeff Goldblum, Siaorse Ronan, Tilda Swinton, Tom Wilkinson, Harvey Keitel, Bob Balaban, Fisher Stevens. I even found Jeff Goldblum convincing and non-irritating, which is rare for me.A bit more focus in the middle-to-end sections and this could have been a great movie.",7,0,4,14 April 2014
The Favourite," Interesting and intriguing
","Early 18th century. Queen Anne is the monarch of England. Her closest friend, confidant and adviser is Lady Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough. Lady Sarah's cousin Abigail comes to the palace, hoping for a job. She used to have status but has fallen on hard times. With Lady Sarah's help Abigail gets a job as a maid. However, her ambitions are much higher than that.Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, which made me sceptical about this movie. Lanthimos's previous two movies - The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer - were pretentious, pointless, random nonsense. Here, however, he adds a fair degree of much-needed substance to the style, creating a movie that is intriguing and interesting, even funny, while set against actual historic events. There's still a fair bit of unnecessary style-over-substance scenes (and sounds - the jarring music was annoying at times) but for the most part this is a good story.Lanthimos makes use of some innovative techniques to enhance the atmosphere. The use of fisheye lens shots was highly original and gives a great sense of the vastness, and emptiness, of the palace.Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone are great in the main roles. Colman as Queen Anne is superb and well deserved her Best Actress Oscar. Solid supporting cast that includes Nicholas Hoult and Mark Gatiss.The ending is a bit flat though. I was hoping for something more powerful and profound.",7,5,8,2 November 2019
1941," This is why Spielberg now only makes dramas...
","December 1941. The Japanese have bombed Pearl Harbour, bring the US into WW2. California may be the next target so US defence forces are mobilised to defend it. This creates a wave of paranoia and an army with weapons that far exceed their operators' skillsets. Turns out, however, that a Japanese submarine is planning to attack the US. Its target: Hollywood.After making Jaws and Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, Steven Spielberg was the darling of Hollywood. The world was his oyster so he thought he expand his horizons and try comedy. Kudos to him for trying, but really he shouldn't have.1941 looks good on paper: co-written by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future 1, 2 and 3, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Forrest Gump), starring Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, Ned Beatty, Warren Oates, Christopher Lee, John Candy, Slim Pickens, Treat Williams, Toshiro Mifune, Robert Stack and Nancy Allen. What could possibly go wrong?Well everything. The plot is all over the place. More alarmingly for a comedy, it's not funny. There's a handful of good comedic moments, but for the most part it's quite flat. The attempts at humour are largely juvenile. The presence of Tim Matheson (notice that he wasn't in the list above...) is a giveaway that this is going to be pretty low-brow, and low-brow it is.Upside is that Spielberg learned his lesson and concentrated on drama after this. Turns out he's pretty good at that...",3,1,1,7 May 2020

Revolutionary Road," Masterpiece
","Another masterpiece from Sam Mendes, maker of the brilliant 'American Beauty' and other good movies such as 'The Road to Perdition' and 'Jarhead'. Similar to American Beauty in that it examines 20th century suburban life - its trials, tribulations, pressures, superficialities, tradeoffs and choices. Very emotional and thought-provoking.Excellent writing and direction. Superb acting by Kate Winslet, as you would expect, and Leonardo DiCaprio. Kathy Bates and Michael Shannon are excellent in their supporting roles.Infinitely better than the last movie Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio made together. You know, the vastly over-rated one with the big unsinkable ship that sank and where Leo died of hypothermia, even though he was King of the World. Yeah, that one... Sorry to remind you of it.",10,0,0,21 March 2014
Foxcatcher," Good, slow-burning drama
","Good, slow-burning drama.Based on a true story, in 1987 a Olympic Gold Medal-winning wrestler, Mark Schultz (played by Channing Tatum), is approached by a billionaire, John Du Pont (played by Steve Carell). Du Pont offers to coach him and a group of other wrestlers with the next Olympics in mind. They will stay at his estate, Foxcatcher. Soon, Schultz's brother, David (played by Mark Ruffalo), is also brought onboard, as an assistant coach. However, Du Pont may be harbouring some personal issues and demons...Intriguing drama though quite slow in its development. Not dull - there's always enough happening to keep you interested. You get the feeling that something is going to happen, but you don't know how calamitous it will be... This said, it does come close to being too slow and there are are signs as to what the conclusion is going to be, just the victim(s) isn't certain. The slow pace also gives you time to think about where everything is going, and this is a bad thing, as you can foresee some of the conclusion.Surprising casting, and it works! Mark Ruffalo was no surprise as David - intellectual, character-driven drama is his bread-and- butter. He put in a solid performance and got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his efforts.No, the surprises are the inclusion of Steve Carell and Channing Tatum. Carell tends to do comedies and his performance here as the very complex and creepy Du Pont is quite a departure for him. Good work by him though, for which he was rewarded with a Best Actor Oscar nomination.Tatum usually stars in cheesy comedies, one-dimensional action movies and/or as eye-candy for females, so a serious drama is a leap for him too. He does get to play a slow-witted meathead here, so maybe not so much of a stretch for him. Good work in the role though.Overall, intriguing though maybe a bit too drawn out. Still good though.",7,0,0,11 December 2015
Lawrence of Arabia," Epic in every way
","Epic in every way.The story of TE Lawrence, the English officer who united and lead the diverse, often warring, Arab tribes during World War 1 in order to fight the Turks. This unity and fight for freedom ultimately lead to the independent Arab states that we now know.Grand in its ambition, grand in its scale, grand in its scenery and cinematography, grand in its running time. Director David Lean captures well the adventures and achievements of Lawrence, as well as his personality, contradictions and inner conflicts.Superb cinematography - the desert vistas are a key positive of the movie.The running time - 3 1/2 hours - does make the movie a bit of an endurance test though. Not that it is ever dull, it is just the sheer amount of time you need to set aside to watch it. Usually I would say, for something like that, that a bit of editing is in order, but there is very little that can be edited out. Almost every scene is integral to the plot. Towards the end, however, there were one or two scenes that could possibly have been cut though.Great work from Peter O'Toole in the lead role, for which he received an Oscar nomination. Good support from a cast that includes Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins, Jose Ferrer, Anthony Quayle and Claude Rains. Omar Sharif received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his performance.",8,1,2,2 April 2016
It Follows," Original, intriguing and engaging horror movie
","A young woman, Jay, goes on a date with a guy she hardly knows. They have sex, after which he informs her that there is a shape- shifting entity following him, and, now that he's made love to her, it will follow her. Soon Jay discovers that he is telling the truth. Her friends and sister don't initially believe her, but they are soon witnesses to the malevolent intentions of the sinister being.Original, intriguing and engaging, which is quite rare for a horror movie. Horror is easily the least original, most formulaic, dullest movie genre, in general and when something this different comes along it is like a breath of fresh air.Decent, unpredictable plot with solid direction from writer-director David Robert Mitchell. Production values are a bit cheap, but, if anything, that helps the movie, giving it an authentic, gritty feel. Also means the director has to rely on plot, improvisation and getting the most out of his cast, rather than throwing large amounts of money mindlessly at special effects, which is a very good thing.The cast are all unknowns and put in solid performances. The lack of stars is probably a good thing, as you have no expectations with regard to the characters, no obvious 'hero' and no egos on display.",8,1,1,6 October 2017
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Predictable and dull
","The title pretty much gives away the entire plot. Interesting build- up but once the ape revolution begins, it is a pretty dull action movie. Plus, I had no empathy for the 'heroes' of the movie, the apes, so from the point I was just hoping the movie would end as soon as possible. Considering the title and what had come before, the conclusion was pretty obvious too (so you really don't need to stick around for the end).Acting is so-so. I found James Franco and his character irritating, but then I always find James Franco, and the characters he plays, irritating. Though one might think this is a prequel to the 2001 Planet of the Apes, apparently it is a reboot. This makes it about the third reboot or remake of the 1968 Planet of the Apes. What was wrong with the original?",4,0,4,2 October 2015
City of God," Brilliant
","Brilliant.Set in a notorious slum of Rio - Cidade de Deus / City of God - the story of a boy who sees his friends and brother grow up or aspire to be gangsters, and decides to do something else. Meanwhile we also see the power struggles in the neighbourhood, how they developed, who the main protagonists are and the state of their feud.A superb story, well told. While the story ultimately spans a few decades, there is no excess detail, and the movie never drifts or is boring. Incredibly gritty.Solid performances too.A classic.",10,1,3,22 December 2015
Cars," Sweet, fun movie
","It is the Piston Cup, the most prestigious event on the racing calendar. After a close-fought race, rookie Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) is within sight of victory when a flat tyre enables two competitors to catch him, resulting in a three-way tie for first place. To decide the winner, the three will race off in California in a week's time. En route to the event, a series of unfortunate events sees McQueen end up in a small town in the middle of nowhere, Radiator Springs. Convicted of driving offenses he has to fix the town's main road, and this could cause him to miss the race. Initially he hates the town and its inhabitants but over time his view changes...Sweet, fun movie. Quite innovative, with animated cars taking the place of humans in the story, with matching other replacements too (eg tractors for cows, flying mini-cars for flies). The car universe is reasonably well thought-out.Plot is fine. At one stage, when McQueen first ends up in the town, the movie looked like it was going down a rather cheesy, dull path. However, over time it finds its direction and ends up being quite emotional, and reasonably profound.Will certainly appeal to kids but there is more than enough to keep adults interested too. Some of the jokes only adults will get (not that they're dirty, you just need to be an adult to know what they're talking about).Great animation, but this is Pixar, so that is a given.Good casting too with host of stars providing the voices, and all being spot-on for the roles: Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, Cheech Marin, Tony Shalhoub, Michael Keaton and the ubiquitous John Ratzenberger. Look out during the end credits for a rather humorous skit that satirizes how Ratzenberger seems to be in every Pixar movie.Good soundtrack too.",7,0,2,25 March 2016
Legend," Okay, but relies too heavily on the novelty of Tom Hardy's dual performance
","The story of the Kray brothers, Ron and Reggie, the twins you ran a gangster empire in London in the 1960s. We see their rise to power, the adversity they faced along the way and while at the top. Moreover, we see how the differences between the two - Reggie the calm businessman, Ron the impulsive thug - often undermines their partnership. Interesting, but not that engaging or compelling. Pretty much a blow-by-blow (often literal) account of their criminal careers, and just that. Some good action scenes and some good humour too, but these aren't enough on their own to lift the film beyond the mediocre.What does lift the movie beyond mediocre is the performance(s) of Tom Hardy. He stars as both brothers and is in top form. Despite the brothers being twins, and being played by the same actor, he manages to give each of them different mannerisms, accents and appearances, to the point you can always tell the brothers apart.You do get the feeling, however, that Hardy's dual performance is the only selling point of the movie. Once Hardy was locked in the writer and director felt they could just live off that novelty.",7,0,1,23 July 2016
The Little Mermaid," Kids will love it
","Kids will love this movie. Animated, simple plot, clear good guys and bad guys, a romance involving a prince, catchy, easy-to-remember tunes and songs, happy ending. Pretty much follows the how-to-make- a-movie-for-kids formula to the letter.However, anyone else is likely to find this quite boring. I certainly did. (The score I have given tries to take the two sides into account. if it was just based on what I think of it, my score would be lower, probably a 3/10).The polarisation doesn't have to occur. It is possible to make movies both adults and kids can like. Movies like Up and Bambi and series like The Simpsons have shown us this.Anyway, a good movie to keep the children busy. Just don't waste your time trying to watch it yourself.",5,5,11,3 October 2014
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Boring
","Boring. If you like impossible flying-through-the-air martial arts fight scenes, this is for you. If, like me, you think elaborate, complex fight sequences are amongst the lowest form of cinematic entertainment, second lowest only to things blowing up frequently, hugely and in bright colours, you will find this boring.Plot is basic. Everything just seems like another segue to another fight scene.Admittedly, cinematography is great. Beautiful scenery, great colour, and the flight scenes are well staged. That's about all I can say on the plus side.",4,0,1,4 May 2016
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Superb: another great piece of movie-making from Quentin Tarantino
","1969. Rick Dalton was once the star of a highly popular TV series but a few bad choices have set his career back, leaving him wondering if he should quit showbiz altogether. His best friend is Cliff Booth, an aging stuntman who was Dalton's stunt-double in movies and TV. His career is largely over. While Booth ekes out an existence, Dalton still lives a life of relative luxury in Hollywood, rubbing shoulders with the rich and famous. In fact, his neighbours are Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate...Superb movie, written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. Not like other Tarantino movies though: his trademarks - frequent, graphic violence and stylised dialogue - are toned down. Instead we have a wonderful character study as we follow the lives of Dalton and Booth, and, to a lesser extent, Sharon Tate.Many Tarantino traits do remain though. The plot is as immersive as ever: the 161 minutes just fly by. The sub-plots are brilliant, especially the movie-within-a-movie segments (would love it if those Rick Dalton movies and TV shows were real...). The movie segments highlight Tarantino's reverence for and extensive knowledge of cinema and its history.The soundtrack is amazing, as you would also expect from Tarantino. Fits perfectly into the movie and helps the momentum of the movie too.Great performances from Leonardo Di Caprio and Brad Pitt in the lead roles. Margot Robbie, as Sharon Tate, doesn't have much dialogue but absolutely lights up the screen. Her innocence and exuberance define the era and set up a wonderful counterpoint to the evil lurking in the shadows.Only reason I didn't give this a 10/10 is that it felt incomplete. I kept thinking that something more was due to happen, but then it didn't. Turned out this was due to my lack of precise knowledge of the events surrounding Sharon Tate. Once I realised what Tarantino had done, I then felt this should be a 10/10. I decided to go with how I felt coming out of the cinema, rather than how I felt after reading a few other reviews and Wikipedia.Therein lies the movie's only problem. The viewer's opinion of this movie is possibly dependant on how much they know about the events surrounding Sharon Tate. I know the historic characters involved, so enjoyed the Hollywood references and in-jokes. I also know how things turned out, so kept expecting the movie to link up with that. My lack of knowledge of the precise details meant I missed Tarantino's clever twist.Someone who has no knowledge of Sharon Tate will not have this weight of expectation and could just watch this as a (totally fictional) drama. Even then it's a great movie, but far less layered for that viewer.",9,21,34,17 August 2019
Behind The Candelabra," Mildly interesting
","Mildly interesting biopic/relationship-drama. Drifts for much of the first half, and only gets interesting when things start to fall apart.Only reason to watch the movie is for the performance of Michael Douglas. Not a very likely role for him, he plays Liberace to perfection.",5,0,3,16 June 2018
Beasts of No Nation," Superb drama - powerful, profound and poignant
","Agu is a young boy in a war-torn African country. The war eventually reaches his town, resulting in his mother and younger siblings fleeing for the capital and his father and older brother being killed by government forces. Agu flees into the jungle where he meets a battalion of rebel soldiers, lead by their charismatic commander, known simply as Commandant. Agu joins the rebels, not realising the things he will see and be required to do.Superb drama, written and directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga (of True Detective fame) and produced by Netflix. Chillingly gritty and realistic, showing how easily an innocent boy can become a veteran soldier and merciless killer. Agu's transformation from bystander to combatant and the changes it causes in him is quite amazing to behold, as it is so gradual yet inevitable.Good story, showing well the anarchy of war, and that there's often no good guys, just adversaries. Also shows the effect of war on its participants. The last few scenes show that even once the war stops, some are mentally still fighting. Emotional ending.Idris Alba is the only known actor in the cast and puts in a solid performance as Commandant. However, Abraham Attah, only 13 or 14 at the time, steals the show as Agu. He is excellent in the role.Solid supporting performances.The best movie Netflix has made, to date.",9,3,3,1 November 2018
Gone Girl," Brilliant thriller
","Brilliant thriller, filled with all the usual David Fincher twists, mind games and clever manipulations. Great plot. While most stories give you a feeling that there is some way out for the 'good guy', here the 'good guy' seems doomed, once the wheels are set in motion. Furthermore, you are never sure who is the 'good guy' and who the 'bad guy'. Even once the twist is revealed, you feel there may be another in store. Very un-Hollywood ending too, which is good.Superb performances by Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike, especially. Pike well-deserved her Best Leading Actress Oscar nomination (maybe win too - Oscar ceremony hasn't occurred yet, at the time of writing this). A searingly brilliant performance by her.Good support from Tyler Perry, Carrie Coon and Kim Dickens.Only negatives, I feel, are that the big twist came too soon. I would like to have been kept in suspense for a while longer. Plus, knowing Fincher's other work, especially Seven and Fight Club, I was expecting a big twist near or at the end. When it came it was gradual, and felt a bit flat. Still a good ending, but it felt like I was being brought down gently, rather than with a jolt.",9,1,7,14 February 2015

Mr. Nobody," Brilliant - highly original, intelligent, thought-provoking, engaging and entertaining
","It is the year 2092. Nemo Nobody is 118 years old and is the last remaining mortal human on earth, as, due to medical advances, all other humans are immortal. He is being interviewed in order to document his life, but the stories he tells seem to run parallel to each other. How could he be in several places at the same time, living, as it were, multiple lives?Brilliant drama. Highly original concept, mixing physics and the choices one makes and how these affect (or don't...) your future. Incredibly intelligent, interesting and plausible, in an existential, philosophical and mathematical sort of way. Makes you ponder life and the paths ours can take.Not just an academic rumination but a great human drama too. Some wonderful relationship-based sub-plots. Quite emotional at times and always very engaging.Clever plot with a great revelation at the end. Very entertaining.Jared Leto is superb in the lead role, effectively playing several versions and different ages of Mr. Nobody, including the 118-year old one.

Some stars in minor roles too: Don Johnson, Franco Nero, Bruce Dern, Jonah Hill, Lee Horsley, Zoe Bell, Robert Carradine, John Jarratt and Tarantino himself.Definitely worth seeing.",9,0,2,13 October 2014
Get Out," Excellent, genre-combining directorial debut from Jordan Peele
","Rose Armitage is taking her boyfriend, Chris Washington, to meet her parents for the first time. He's a bit uneasy about how they'll treat him, as they're white and he's black. However, her parents turn out to be unfazed and everything seems to be going fine. Chris then starts to notice some weird behavioral traits with the black staff at the house. The Armitages then throw a huge party and Chris ends up in some awkward conversations with the guests. He initially just puts it down to the racial difference, but then the guests', and Armitages', motives start to appear more sinister. Chris decides it is time to get out...Great directorial debut from Jordan Peele, who also wrote the script. Peele was one half of the hilarious comedy duo Key and Peele, so you would be excused for thinking that his first movie would be a comedy. Get Out is not a comedy. It starts as a social commentary and ends as a horror-thriller. In both respects it is great, though I preferred the social drama aspect more. Some very clever observations regarding race relations in the first half of the movie, and I imagine a fairly accurate depiction of the African-American experience. As a horror-thriller the build up and plot development is very good but the ending felt a bit too easy and rushed. The conclusion is also not very profound, which is a bit disappointing after all the social observations that came before. This said, the ending would be the only weak spot, and it only appears weak because the rest of the movie was so good. Peele does throw in some comedy moments, via the character of Rod Williams, and these are great.Solid performances all round. Daniel Kaluuya, as Chris, is probably the best of lot. LilRel Howery, as Rod Williams, almost steals the show though.Great movie.",8,11,21,5 May 2017
Drive," Good, but not great
","A man, an expert driver, hires out his skills to any bidder. The jobs don't have to be legal, and they generally aren't. He is cold, calm, unquestioning and detached - traits that make him good at what he does. Then he falls for his neighbour, a married woman, and things get complicated.Good, but not great. Good, intense plot and great action. However, plot does lose focus and seem contrived at times. Direction is good, but includes far too many self-indulgent lingering shots, trying to seem arty.Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston and Albert Brooks are great in their roles. I was not overly impressed with Ryan Gosling, however. The (wannabe) cool, silent routine works for a little while before becoming irritating.",7,1,2,24 June 2016
The Theory of Everything," Great, engaging story
","Great, engaging story.The story of English physicist Stephen Hawking (played by Eddie Redmayne) from his time at Cambridge University to the present. Shows in painful detail the effects of motor neuron disease on him. Also shows how his relationship with his wife Jane (played by Felicity Jones), their first meeting, and how she cared for him once his condition deteriorated, and the ups and downs in their relationship.As importantly, it shows how he continued working, constantly theorizing on the origins of the Universe and other physics problems.Good biopic. Apparently not entirely accurate in some parts, but close enough for the most part. Characters are well developed and the movie is very engaging.Superb performance by Eddie Redmayne. He captures the mannerisms, and even physical appearance, of Stephen Hawking perfectly. Got the 2015 Best Actor Oscar for his efforts, though I think there is very little to choose between his and Michael Keaton's performances (in Birdman).Great performance too from the mesmerizingly beautiful Felicity Jones. Her performance got her a Best Actress Oscar nomination.Good supporting cast, with Charlie Cox and David Thewliss to the fore.",8,0,2,12 June 2015
Frozen," Better than I expected
","Better than I expected. I was expecting a cheesy child-orientated movie with an unoriginal, predictable plot. It is better than that. Plot is decent and reasonably original, though is mostly aimed at children. Not so cheesy as to be nauseating to adults. Does start to wear thin after a while, however - some of the characters and plot devices are quite silly.I was also expecting the music to be overly child-orientated but they're generally OK. Some are a bit of an ordeal but some are actually quite pleasant. On that note, 'Let it go' is OK, but is vastly over-rated.Kids will enjoy it. Adults can give it a miss. However, if you are forced to watch it, it's not that painful.",6,2,8,8 October 2014
The Lives of Others," Brilliant
","Brilliant. East Berlin, 1984. The Cold War is still raging and the communist bloc does not trust its own citizens. A Secret Police agent is tasked with conducting surveillance on a writer and his lover. Over time, rather than being coldly distant, he finds himself being absorbed by their private lives...A great examination of life in East Germany during Communist rule, and how empathy can overcome fascism. Perfect ending.Great performances all round, especially from the three main actors - Martina Gedeck, Ulrich Muhe and Sebastian Koch.Well deserved its Best Foreign Language Film Oscar in 2007, and should have been nominated for more than just that.",10,4,6,19 December 2015
Room," Wonderful - highly original and incredibly emotional
","A mother, Joy (played by Brie Larson), and her five-year old son, Jack (Jacob Tremblay), are held captive in a one-room shed. She was abducted by a stranger, Nick, and has been there for seven years. Jack was born there and the room is his entire world. Then one day they escape and get to live normal lives. For Jack, the world he now is confronted by is a very foreign place.A wonderful movie: highly original and incredibly emotional. Just the initial plot - a mother and her son imprisoned for several years and how they escape - was original enough but then we have the psychological and emotional implications of returning to society (or, in Jack's case, joining society for the first time), and this takes the plot to another plane. Jack being confronted by and adapting to his new world is wonderfully and very sensitively told. His mother having to deal with all her doubts regarding Jack adapting, and any residual guilt she feels from their time in captivity, is a great, and quite natural, story line too.Great, emotional ending that perfectly ties up the movie.Brie Larson got a Best Actress Oscar for her performance and deserved it. Jacob Tremblay, 8/9 years old at the time, is fantastic as Jack, showing acting skills well beyond his age. Solid performances from a supporting cast that includes Joan Allen and William H Macy.My favourite movie of 2015.",10,1,3,4 June 2016
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Well-intentioned...but severely flawed
","Well-intentioned...but severely flawed.The original Secret Life of Walter Mitty, released in 1947, was brilliant. Whimsical, bitter-sweet and hilariously funny. Danny Kaye almost single-handedly made the movie, with an incredible over- the- top comedic performance.The 2013 is nothing like the 1947 version, unfortunately. It has more of an attempt at a message and thus greater ambitions but is not that funny. Ben Stiller is certainly no Danny Kaye, even when he is trying to be funny, and here he isn't trying. Moreover, the whole 'get out there and live life' message is delivered in such a clumsy and contrived way, you wish he had just tried to make a straight comedy (it worked in 1947!). The message is obvious from the start, but director Ben Stiller takes us on this long, protracted, silly journey to draw it out. From a point (that point being where WM meets the bogan helicopter pilot in Greenland) the movie is incredibly farcical, and not in a good way. About the only good part to the latter 50-70% of the movie is the scenery: National Geographic would be proud!Nice, sweet ending, though quite predictable and not a little bit trite.Performances are so-so. Ben Stiller overdoes the shy and retiring shtick and Adam Scott is incredibly stereotypical as the bad guy. Kristen Wiig's is probably the only engaging performance in the movie.See the 1947 version instead.",5,1,3,1 November 2014
Schindler's List," Powerful, edifying, emotional movie
","The true story of Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who, in World War 2, saved thousands of Jews from execution by the Nazis.Powerful movie. Shows well the extremes of man's inhumanity to other men (the Nazi concentration camps and the systematic extermination of the Jews) and how there is also good in the world, fighting this evil. Quite graphic in showing what the Jews went through. This makes the saving of many of them from this fate even the more emotional.Superb performance by Liam Neeson in the lead role. An equally compelling performance comes from Ralph Fiennes as the sadistic SS concentration camp commander. No cartoon villain, Fiennes inhabits the role and makes him a worthy adversary for Schindler and an evil that must be vanquished.",8,9,14,3 February 2017
Across the Universe," Brilliant
","A love story-musical set in the 60s with the storyline tied together by Beatles songs, sung by the actors. Brilliant. I generally hate musicals but this one works so well. The songs fit seamlessly into the plot and the music scenes don't seem contrived at all. The director and scriptwriter even went to the effort of weaving other Beatles references into the story, eg the characters generally have names taken from Beatles songs, and some scenes are meant to remind us of Beatles events (eg band performing on a roof). Very clever, and doesn't detract from the movie at all.The story itself is quite moving, the acting good, the direction great, the singing by the (mostly) actors surprisingly very good, but it is the music, and its perfect placement in the movie, that makes the movie. Made me want to haul out every Beatles album I own (and I have most of them) and listen to them from end to end.",10,1,2,19 April 2014
The Incredibles," Quite formulaic but kids will enjoy it
","Quite formulaic but kids will enjoy it.The Incredibles is an animated action-drama about a family of superheroes who are forced to live normal lives. However, after a time Mr Incredible is lured out of superhero retirement, and then the action begins...Pretty conventional plot, especially once they start being superheroes again. The superheroes-in-retirement part could have made this different from most of these sorts of movies but wasn't exploited very well.So, pretty much common-or-garden animated superhero movie. Ideal for kids but adults will find it predictable and ordinary. This said, there are some funny lines and scenes for adults, especially anything involving the superheroes' tailor/fashion designer. Overall, fun enough to be likable.",6,2,4,11 June 2015
The Mist," Slightly better than your average horror movie
","The Draytons - David, Steff and their son Billy - live in a small Maine town. One night a ferocious storm hits the area, damaging their house. The storm is accompanied by a strange mist. David and Billy and their neighbour Brent Norton go into town. There they discover that the mist contains some frightening creatures, creatures intent on killing humans.A so-so horror movie, directed and written by Frank Darabont and based on a novel by Stephen King. Darabont's first two movies were brilliant and among the best films of the 1990s. I am, of course, referring to The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile. In 2001 he directed The Majestic, also superb, yet criminally underrated. Unlike his first two movies, The Majestic was not based on a Steven King novel and was not written by Darabont. For The Mist, his fourth (and, to date, last), he goes back to his original formula -adapt and direct a Stephen King book/short story.The result is not close to being in the same league as his first three movies. Largely a common-or-garden creature-horror film, this has nothing of the depth of those three movies. There are a few interesting themes - mob mentality and religious zealousness to the fore - but these are at best tertiary to the horror-thriller element.The plot is not helped by some incredibly irritating characters and a general feeling of disengagement.Due to the themes, ends up slightly better than your average horror movie, but that doesn't say much. It's easily the weakest genre.",5,1,3,27 May 2017

","The world has been invaded by fearsome, murderous creatures that are totally blind and sense humans via sound. A family has managed to escape the creatures and have survived for over a year on an isolated farm. However, the creatures appear to have located their hideout.Originally idea, initially. The fact that there are no sounds for large stretches of the movie, especially in the first half or so, made for a novel experience. However, it also made the movie less engaging, especially as the first half of the movie was also quite slow going, and I found my mind wandering.Things ramped up from a point, making it more interesting. However, from that point it was really just another creature-horror movie, though with a tighter plot (not that the plot is entirely satisfactory, but it is better than that of your average horror movie).Ultimately: okay, but not great. Some novel ideas, but also a lot of standard horror movie stuff too.",6,1,2,12 January 2019

The social commentary is brave and innovative, especially for a movie from 1975.The other change is in the seriousness of the subject. Initially the movie is quite funny. Sonny (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale)'s attempt to rob the bank is so bad it is hilarious. However, their is always the thought that tragedy is not far away, and Lumet keeps this idea ticking throughout the movie.Great acting by Al Pacino.

Amadeus," Enthralling, enchanting, edifying masterpiece
","It is the early 19th century. An old man is thrown into an insane asylum after trying to commit suicide. He is Antonio Salieri and in the asylum he is visited by a priest, to whom he confesses that he killed Mozart. He then recounts his time as court composer to Emperor Joseph II of Austria. Mozart appears at the court and is hired by the Emperor to produce an opera. His genius is quite evident. Salieri is a devout Christian man and believes all musical talent and inspiration is given by God. Mozart's personal life and extracurricular activities appall Salieri. He cannot reconcile Mozart's talent and his lifestyle and sets out to drive him from the court. Initially his aim is to undermine him but over time his intentions turn deadlier.An enthralling, enchanting, edifying masterpiece. Directed by Milos Forman, who also gave us One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and Ragtime and, later, Man On The Moon and The People vs Larry Flynt. Like in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, insanity is one of his themes, especially, here, the link between creative genius and insanity (this was also touched on in Man On The Moon). With this in mind, there's a lightness to the movie which propels it along. The movie could easily have been a long, linear, paint-by- numbers account of Mozart's adult life, but Forman gives his characters heaps of depth, and, as mentioned, creates a vibrancy which is very engaging.There is also plenty of darkness, and this plays off against the light on a few levels: insanity vs sanity, funny vs sombre moments, Salieri's faith vs the hedonism of Mozart (and Salieri's later doubts of his own faith). A wonderful combination of contrasts.Most of all, this is an exploration of creative genius, the genius that was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Forman, aided by Tom Hulce as Mozart, F Murray Abraham as Salieri and a wonderful orchestra and soundtrack, powerfully illustrates just how staggeringly talented Mozart was. For example, we have him writing down compositions without correction - he didn't need to play them, it was all in his head and perfectly formed. We also have Mozart dictating music he had just created in his head, showing his thought processes. His creative process is laid bare for all to see, and it is amazing.As mentioned, the soundtrack is great. Background pieces are produced well and chosen well.Both Tom Hulce and F Murray Abraham were nominated for Best Actor Oscars, and both deserved their nominations. F Murray Abraham's Salieri is a study in machinations and malevolence. Hulce is wonderfully over-the-top as the free-spirited genius Mozart. Abraham won the Oscar, but both are fantastic in their roles.Supporting cast gives solid performances. Among the cast are Jeffrey Jones, as Emperor Joseph II, and Simon Callow plus Cynthia Nixon in an early-career minor role.",10,1,2,11 June 2016
The Game," Intriguing, but flawed, thriller
","Intriguing, but flawed, thriller.The Game relies heavily on a clever plot, and for you to suspend disbelief. The clever plot is maybe too clever for its own good, creating plot holes. Eventually, after the umpteenth twist the whole thing just feels implausible.This said, it is quite entertaining - a roller-coaster ride of a movie.

However, it is better than that. The scene-setting and plot development are good and the characters engaging. There's a nice ebb and flow to the build-up to the relationship. Great scenery and cinematography too.Unfortunately, the groundwork is negated to an extent by the last third or so of the movie, where it does become a fairly standard romantic drama. The conclusion is not overly profound nor original either.Overall, watchable but it seemed headed for something more powerful and profound.",6,3,7,19 September 2018
Gran Torino," Great movie
","Great, very moving, movie, directed by Clint Eastwood. Not perfect, as the plot seemed contrived and inconsistent at times, though the ending makes up for that. Clint Eastwood plays the grizzled old curmudgeon central character to perfection.",8,1,1,27 June 2020
Hero," Decent story, great cinematography, ridiculous fight scenes
","Ancient China and the Qin Empire is out to conquer the six kingdoms. This makes its king a target for assassination. However, one man has single-handedly ensured the safety of the king, by killing the three most notorious assassins in the land. Treated as a hero, he is summoned for an audience with the king.Interesting story, set against historic events. Some nice twists and sub-plots along the way. Superb cinematography, especially the use of vivid colours. This is the highlight of the movie, as the colours and artful use of them is certainly the most memorable thing about the movie.However, most of this is offset by the action scenes. The fight scenes consist mainly of the ridiculous unrealistic, well-choreographed-but-stupid type. You know, the flying through the air, hovering in mid-air, miraculously dodging swords and arrows, super slow-motion type. Turned what should have been a great movie into a farce.",6,1,1,15 September 2019
The Hurt Locker," Brilliant
","Brilliant, gritty, dramatic portrayal of a US Army bomb disposal unit in Iraq. Searingly intense without being manipulative or contrived (there is no music within scenes, for example, so the intensity is not artificially lifted by music). Can seem to drift at times, but in the end it all makes sense, and has a place. The punchline at the end makes it all worth it.Kathryn Bigelow directs with a deft and varying touch, revealing details which seem insignificant at the time, and omitting details and events which you would think would be important. In the end, it all makes sense. The use of home-movie-style hand-held cameras in certain scenes can be a bit disconcerting at times, but ultimately suited the scene.Superb performance by then relatively unknown Jeremy Renner. He well deserved his Oscar nomination.",10,0,2,19 April 2014
K-19: The Widowmaker," Not bad
","I only watched this because it is directed by Kathryn Bigelow, who directed the superb The Hurt Locker. I had my reservations, as it looked like a standard Harrison Ford / submarine thriller, albeit based on a true story.Turns out it was I expected, but isn't too bad. Has some originality, and captures the claustrophobia and danger of a submarine well. Would have been better without Harrison Ford though. He gives his usual stony-faced man-for-a-crisis routine, and comes across as fairly wooden.Liam Neeson's character is also fairly irritating, basically just suggesting the opposite to Harrison Ford's, at every opportunity.Ultimately, a fairly interesting capturing of an unknown event in naval history, an event which could have resulted in far more horrific consequences than it did.",6,0,0,23 November 2017
The Longest Day," An epic among epics
","WW2 dramas do not get more epic than this. Massive in its scale, involving every nation and almost every operation and type of unit that took part in Operation Overlord. Thanks to this you get a true sense of all the planning, men and materiel involved in the invasion, and how they all fit together. By showing the German side you also see how the enemy feels, and how wrong-footed they were.Not as realistically gory as Saving Private Ryan - such realism would never gave gotten past the 1960s censors - but such micro-detailed realism is not necessary here. The picture is more a strategic one, though you often get to see it from the eyes of average soldiers.Mostly quite accurate, but there are some mildly-annoying inaccuracies. The portrayal of 27-year old Lt Colonel Benjamin Vandervoort by the 55- year old John Wayne is probably the pick of the bunch. Once the action starts, however, the mild inaccuracies are quickly forgotten, as you immerse yourself in reliving an event of massive historical significance.In fitting with the epic nature of the movie, just about every actor in it with dialogue is a major star. About the only male superstars of the time missing are Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando and Orson Welles! Some of them, eg George Segal, Sean Connery, Robert Wagner, have very minor parts and only have a handful of lines, but it shows just how deep the talent pool was in the cast of the movie.Stirring, incredible, epic war drama.",9,3,5,9 June 2014

","The first Amazing Spiderman was surprisingly good. I liked the Tobey Maguire series and felt that a reboot wasn't necessary. However, that reboot didn't feel like it is covering old ground, and felt fresh, original and energetic. It was interesting from start to finish.On the other hand, the second movie in the reboot series doesn't really add anything or feel fresh. It is pretty much a formulaic comic book adaptation. The only attempts at character development - the love story - felt weak, and were quite dull and tedious.This said it is entertaining enough to keep you watching. Not a must-see, but it's okay.",6,0,0,8 January 2018

Ex Machina," Good movie, just a pity about the ending
","Good movie, just a pity about the ending.A junior coder working at the company that runs the world's most popular search engine (no, it's not Google) wins a company lottery. The prize is a week at the CEO's estate / research facility. When he gets there he discovers that the boss has been working on androids with superior Artificial Intelligence. The coders job is to test how 'human' the android is. What develops is a manipulative game between the android and the coder.Clever, almost plausible movie. Clearly a lot of thinking went into the plot and the dialogue. Far better than a similar-themed movie like Artificial Intelligence which tackled the 'can robots feel' subject in an overly sentimental and ultimately empty and inconsequential manner. Incredibly intriguing, and was set up for a very profound ending.(Spoilers ahead). And that's where it went from a brilliant movie to just a good one. The ending is quite weak. There are no great profundities - it is really just a thriller-ending, and one inconsistent with what went before.Moreover, the writer/director paints the android as the hero and the humans as the villains, which is quite a preposterous suggestion, and not consistent with the plot. I had no empathy toward the android at all - it's a machine ffs! - so the ending felt incredibly flat, and a touch annoying. The scenes leading up to it also seemed a bit implausible.Good work by Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac and Alicia Vikander in the main roles. After his great performances in Inside Llewyn Davis, Show Me a Hero and this, it can't be long before Oscar Isaac wins an acting Oscar.",7,0,2,12 September 2015

It still has the wooden, looking broody instead of acting, performances of the first, and the limited dialogue. However, the plot is even duller this time. And now, to add to the lack of acting, we have one 'actor' whose only function seems to be to show off his abs at any opportunity!Even worse, it just goes on and on. 130 minutes for something this bad - that's 120 minutes longer than the concentration span of its intended female teen audience.Watch True Blood instead.",2,3,4,29 June 2015
Patton," Superb film on an extraordinary, larger-than-life man
","The World War 2 history of General George S Patton, US Army. We see his contribution to the Allied War effort, from North Africa, to Sicily to Europe, especially the Battle of the Bulge. We also see his forthright views on war and winning it, his tactical and strategic military genius, his aggressive manner of waging war as well as his blunt, mischievous, rebellious, almost insubordinate attitude.Superb film on an extraordinary, larger-than-life man. Patton was truly a military genius and the movie demonstrates this very well. It also demonstrates well the lack of diplomacy which often set his career back.Excellent performance by George C Scott in the lead role, a performance for which he won an Oscar.The movie itself won the 1971 Best Picture Oscar.",9,6,6,31 January 2017
La Grande Illusion," Interesting WW1 drama
","Western Front, World War 1. Captain Boeldieu and Lt. Marechal are shot down and captured by the Germans. For them the war is over, it seems, but they have other plans.Interesting WW1 drama, written and directed by the famed French director Jean Renoir. Could be described as an anti-war drama, as it does not glamorize life in wartime at all. Quite original in that respect as most movies of the time (All Quiet On the Western Front would be another exception) romanticized war. Also quite novel for its time in that it shows life in a POW camp - it was only in the 50s and 60s that POW movies became popular (Stalag 17 and The Great Escape being the best examples).Not brilliant though, and hardly the classic I was expecting. The story isn't overly compelling nor profound and ends in fairly predictable fashion. Renoir's camerawork seems a bit amateurish at times, with jarring, clumsy panning shots. Some of the acting is a bit hammy, with Erich von Stroheim, as von Rauffenstein, to the fore.",7,3,4,31 May 2018
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," Mildly interesting
","Mildly interesting.An animated fantasy-adventure. Set 1,000 years from now, the earth is ravaged by pollution and war. In the Valley of the Wind lives Nausicaa, princess of her people. Their land borders on a toxic jungle, filled with dangerous over-sized insects. Meanwhile two nearby nations are bitterly engaged in a war and the Valley of the Wind is stuck in the middle...A so-so movie. Was reasonably interesting initially but the story lacked focus or engagement as it went on. It is really just one long rambling story, filled with random turns of events. There's no character depth or variety - characters are either good guys or bad guys, and clearly and stereotypically so. There is no grey.No profundities, except some half-hearted, naive attempts at statements about war and the environment.Kids will enjoy it (the hero is a young girl, after all, so kids must be the target market). Intelligent adults will find it average, even tedious.",5,8,16,9 January 2016

","Benjamin Button lives his life backwards, starting as an old man and getting younger instead of older. This has a major impact on his relationships.Good movie. Interesting and very original plot.

Transformers," It's a Michael Bay movie - 'nuff said...
","A high school student, Sam (played by Shia LeBeouf), buys his first car. The car turns out to be a Transformer, a robot that can transform itself into many different things (but mostly vehicles). The car is a benevolent Transformer but there are evil ones out there...The fact that this is directed by Michael Bay should tip you off that this is going to filled with many spectacular explosions, and nothing else. Spectacularly bad, just like Pearl Harbour: weak plot, laughable dialogue, wooden acting. Clearly made for kids. Ironically, it is 2.5 hours long, making it a bit too long for kids' concentration spans. Mr Bay clearly has not even adhered to the first rule of movie making - if you can't make a good movie, make a short movie.",2,1,2,11 March 2016
Pawn Sacrifice," Great insight into the talent and mind of a tortured genius
","A dramatization of the life of Bobby Fischer, one of the greatest chess players of all time. While covering his early life and chess career, focuses largely on the 1972 World Chess Championship match between Fischer and the reigning champion Boris Spassky.Great movie. Shows well Bobby Fischer's exceptional talent for chess and also the mental issues that seemed to be part and parcel of this genius.Always interesting but not consistently engaging though. Coverage of Fischer's childhood and early career give a decent background to how his talent and personality and mental issues developed but aren't compelling viewing. However, when the movie reaches the 1972 World Championship Match it shifts into top gear and becomes incredibly engrossing viewing.Great performance by Tobey Maquire as Fischer. Solid supporting cast that includes Liev Schreiber (as Spassky), Michael Stuhlbarg and Peter Sarsgaard.For an even greater insight into the talent, mind and personal demons of Bobby Fischer watch 'Bobby Fischer Against The World' (2011). Superb documentary.",8,1,2,10 August 2019
Hidden Figures," Interesting, moving story
","The true story of three black women who worked on the NASA space program in the 1960s. While using their maths and other intellectual skills to help the US put a man in orbit around the Earth and ultimately on the Moon, they face prejudice and discrimination at every turn, some of which is state-endorsed.Interesting, moving story. A reminder of the racial prejudices that existed in the US only 50 years ago, many of which was statute- enshrined. The movie shows how these prejudices are broken down when people realise that race has no impact on ability. Not overly original in its themes, but well told, and told in an original setting. The fact that this is based on a true story helps too.",8,1,6,10 June 2017
Coco," Sweet and entertaining
","Young Miguel is an aspiring musician but his family forbids music of any sort in or around the house. This dates back to his great-great grandfather, who left his family to pursue a musical career. The hero of Miguel's town is the famous (and, several decades-ago, deceased) Ernesto de la Cruz, regarded, in his day, as one of the greatest musicians in the world. Defying his family, Miguel enters a Day of the Dead talent contest but, after his grandmother smashes his guitar, is forced to 'borrow' Ernesto's guitar from the museum. This sets off a chain of events, resulting in Miguel entering the afterlife and needing to get Ernesto's blessing to re-enter the living world.Sweet, entertaining movie from Disney and Pixar. Energetic with an emotional ending and some interesting takes on family, loss and memories.Not brilliant - it is slanted more towards kids than adults. Once the afterlife segment starts it relies a lot on cheap sight gags involving skeletons' body parts. The middle section feels like your usual kids' adventure story, with predictable, action-based plot development. Things get better towards the end, due to a decent twist and an emotional, reasonably profound ending.",7,0,1,5 July 2018
1917," Okay but underwhelming
","April 1917, the Western Front. Two British soldiers are sent to deliver an urgent message to an isolated regiment. If the message is not received in time the regiment will walk into a trap and be massacred. To get to the regiment they will need to cross through enemy territory. Time is of the essence and the journey will be fraught with danger.I had highish hopes for this movie. Written and directed by Sam Mendes, who gave us such superb films as American Beauty, Revolutionary Road, Road to Perdition and Jarhead, and massively hyped this looked like it should be one of the best war films to come out for a while. Turns out, it's not.The plot is interesting enough but that's about it. 1917 doesn't go anywhere new, say anything profound or even provide a large amount of entertainment. It's an odyssey involving characters who are clumsily drawn and aren't particularly engaging, with some goodish action scenes that are few and far between. The military side is okay but not 100% plausible.If you were hoping that this might be a confronting drama, showing the wastefulness of war, there's elements of that but it has been done before and done better and more jarringly. It's only confronting and profound if you've never watched a realistic war movie before, and even then it's probably not graphic or engaging enough to make a profound point regarding war.Overall, it's okay, but not great, and quite disappointing.",6,64,141,11 January 2020
Lincoln," Good, but not great
","Good, but not great, drama, telling the story of the passing of the 13th Amendment to the US Constitution.Very Interesting, from an historic perspective. However, many of the scenes that aren't concerned with the passing of the Amendment are pretty much just padding, and quite trite. Character development seems token at times. Spielberg once again turns a serious adult drama into a movie with a Family Channel/Disney feel (see War Horse for an even worse/better example).Daniel Day Lewis carries the movie. He is in almost every scene, and does a very convincing job of portraying Lincoln. Good support from a host of stars: Sally Field, David Strathairn, Tommy Lee Jones, James Spader, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Hal Holbrook.",7,0,2,4 March 2014
Sing Street," Basic plot but quite entertaining
","Dublin, 1985. 15-year old Conor has just moved to a new school and, between the inane rules, fascist teacher-priests and bullies, it is a daunting place. He meets a beautiful girl, Raphina, and is immediately smitten by her. To get to see her he says he is in a band and they need a model for a music video, and would she be interested? She agrees. Only problem - he doesn't have a band. He hastily forms one and the creativity starts to flow...Pretty basic plot. The whole set up with Conor and Raphina is quite contrived. There is no background, limited scene setting and them meeting even seems like a non-event it is so low-key. This is not helped by the fact that she looks (and in real life, is) about 5 years older than him, rather than the one year mentioned in the movie. Made the whole romance seem implausible from the start.The plot develops in a similar vein, with a few contrivances and implausibilities along the way. Ultimately it is fairly trite and predictable.However, while lacking in substance, the movie is still very entertaining. While predictable, the plot is quite fun and there are some good comedic moments. The music is good, giving the movie great momentum, and the characters are reasonably engaging.Add to this some solid performances and, though not brilliant, Sing Street is still pretty good and never dull.",7,1,2,11 February 2017
Pi," Leaves you with more questions than answers
","Being a mathematical person (I have a Masters degree in Statistics) I was intrigued by the premise of the movie but in the end I was left with more questions than answers and was left hanging. The plot includes too much of the mathematical detail (and medical detail, listing all the drugs Cohen was taking!), often coming across as nerdy.The solution seemed too straightforward and practical, with many details lacking here (unlike in the build-up). I thought the final mix might include emotions, basically a more relationship-centric argument, especially as the plot did allude to the potential for something to happen between Cohen and his neighbour, but this didn't come up at all.This all said, Darren Aronofsky is clearly a very talented director. His use of the black&white medium and close-up camera shots in Pi were a stroke of genius - it certainly helped one get into Cohen's mind. Requiem for a Dream is an outstanding movie but Pi fails to deliver because he took on a very weighty and complex subject in his first attempt at a motion picture. The problem lies in the screenplay (which he co-wrote), and not his direction, however.It is interesting to note Aronofsky's use of some of the effects that he would later use in Requiem for a Dream, especially the fast- forward pill-popping sequence which was always worth a chuckle in both movies (in a dark sort of way).",6,0,0,4 May 2016
Kelly's Heroes," Hilarious
","Great war-comedy. Hilarious in its take on the silliness of the military, with a decent amount of drama thrown in. Reminiscent of MASH, the movie and the series, and Catch 22, the book (the movie adaptation was less good). Great performances from an all-star cast. Casting is spot-on: Clint Eastwood as the hard-bitten, decisive, take-command Kelly; Telly Savalas as the tough sergeant; Donald Sutherland as the hilariously insane Oddball; Don Rickles as the deal-a-minute stores sergeant; Carroll O'Connor as the clueless general. Also includes Harry Dean Stanton in a relatively minor role.Also has one of the best and most memorable theme songs of all time - 'Burning Bridges' by the Mike Curb Congregation.",9,4,6,4 October 2015
Million Dollar Baby," Incredibly moving - superb movie
","Frankie Dunn (played by Clint Eastwood) owns and runs a boxing gym in Los Angeles, as well as managing some of the boxers there. Working for him is Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman). One day he is approached by Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank) who wants him to train her. He declines. Undeterred, Maggie joins his gym, hoping that he'll notice her and train. He is equally perseverant, knocking back all her requests to train her. However, eventually she wears him down and he trains her and manages her fight career. Her career goes very well and she now has a shot at the WBA title. Her opponent, the champion, does not play fair though...Brilliant beyond description. Much much more than simply a boxing movie. It's a movie about friendship, looking out for one another and caring for those you love. Wonderful character depth and development and relationship development. Made by a twist nobody would see coming, and an ending that is emotional beyond compare.Superb performance by Hillary Swank in the lead role, for which she won her second Oscar. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman are also great in their roles - Eastwood got a Best Actor Oscar nomination and Freeman won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Freeman also provides the narration for the movie, and this is always a good thing. The movie itself deservedly won the Best Picture Oscar in 2005 and Eastwood won Best Director.This was to be Clint Eastwood's magnum opus and came in the middle of a purple patch for him. Before this he has made Mystic River and after was to come Flags of our Fathers, Letters from Iwo Jima, Changeling, Gran Torino and Invictus.",10,1,3,20 August 2016

","Decent sci fi-horror movie.In 2040 a space exploration vehicle, the Event Horizon, disappears near Neptune. In 2047 a search vehicle finds the Event Horizon and sets about figuring what happened. The crew might not like what they find...Fairly interesting and intriguing plot. Though you sort of know where this is going (from the synopsis and first signs in the movie), it is not that predictable. It is just original enough to keep you interested..On the downside, plot is not entirely watertight. eg Ship's hull is fractured, yet the crew in the affected area are still able to breathe...CGI is fine.Good dramatic cast - Laurence Fishburne, Sam Neill, Joely Richardson, Kathleen Quinlan (among others) - who all put in solid performances.Not a must-see, but reasonably entertaining.",6,0,1,30 June 2015

","Reasonably entertaining.Halloween has just come and gone and for Jack Skellington, the King of Halloweentown, it was the usual success. However, for Jack it is just more of the same, and is becoming boring. Then he stumbles across Christmastown...Reasonably good fun. I don't care about Halloween so much of the ghoulishness in the background was wasted on me. However, the whole ghouls-take-over-Christmas theme was quite original and lead to some quite funny moments. The music generally keeps the movie rollicking along and it is quite short, thus does not overstay its welcome. On the negative side, the plot does seem rather random and silly at times. Some scenes just go nowhere.Overall, more hit than miss, but it was close.",6,0,0,2 November 2015

His only used for robots, however, is in robot fights. Then his brother shows him around his university, and introduces him to a healthcare robot he created, Baymax, and Hiro starts to see all the possibilities for his talent. To get into university he comes up with an ingenious invention, but this leads to tragedy...I was expecting something aimed squarely at kids and was pleasantly surprised when the movie wasn't dumbed-down to that extent. It will appeal to kids, but adults will love it too. The humour is clever, the action is good, but not overdone, and the plot is solid. Good voice casting too.Very entertaining.",8,5,8,17 September 2015
Grave of the Fireflies," Incredibly powerful and emotional drama
","Japan, World War 2. Teenage boy Seita and his young sister Setsuko are left homeless and effectively orphaned when their city is firebombed by US bombers. They end up living with an aunt. Initially things go well and life seems almost normal again. However, their relationship with their aunt deteriorates and Seita and Setsuko decide to leave and fend for themselves. They find a place and things seem to be going well. However, over time food gets scarcer and life becomes a constant struggle for survivalA quite powerful examination of life among the civilian population of a nation at war. More broadly, this is a story of survival and the bonds between a brother and sister, made stronger by a cataclysmic series of events. The war is just the setting, and the initial cause of the events – at its core it's a human drama. This is good, as the movie could easily have gone down some sort of bleeding heart anti-war path or even a path that condemned the US bombing of Japanese cities in WW2 (which would have been absurd as the Japanese were just reaping the whirlwind after sowing the wind).Incredibly engaging. You are emotionally invested in the lives of Seita and Setsuko, their struggles and wins, highs and lows. This makes the conclusion very emotional.Superb animation, though you would expect nothing less from director Isao Takahata (director of the TV series Heidi and Maya, amongst others). Some of the imagery is stunningly beautiful, like watercolour paintings.On the negative side, and probably the only reason I didn't give this a 10/10, the outcomes are a bit telegraphed. The conclusion would have been even more powerful and emotional if we didn't know in advance what it was going to be.",9,0,1,14 January 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Has its moments but generally unengaging and dull
","Picking up where The Force Awakens left off, Rey meets Luke Skywalker and tries to convince him to help The Resistance. He is initially hesitant but eventually decides to train Rey in the way of The Force. However, Kylo Ren also wants to track down Skywalker, and uses Rey for that purpose. Meanwhile, The Resistance are locked in deadly battle with the First Order and, while they have some minor victories, it seems like a futile struggle.I'm not generally a Star Wars fan but to my surprise I enjoyed Episode VII - The Force Awakens. It grabbed my attention from the word go and held it all the way through. A rollicking adventure with engaging characters. Moreover, the blending of the old characters and the new was very well done, with the feeling that the torch had been passed to the new generation.Unfortunately, Episode VIII doesn't come close to the engagement, novelty and adventure of Episode VII. Its essentially one long action-drama, with little in the way of engagement or originality. The Rey-Kylo Ren relationship had potential but went nowhere new or interesting and was snuffed out pretty quickly. Them possibly working together held my attention but the intrigue was short-lived. The movie simply degenerated into action sequences after that.On the upside, no need to waste my time on Episode IX (Or X, or XI, or...)...",4,9,14,27 October 2018
Brave," Only for kids
","A movie only for kids, and girls in particular.Set in Scotland in medieval times, a young princess, Merida, grows up to be quite independent (and very proficient with bow and arrow!). Her mother tries to marry her off, but she refuses. In frustration at her mother dictating her life, she has a witch put a spell on her mother. Unfortunately, it doesn't come out as planned...Mostly quite silly and dull. Cheap jokes, random plot, scenes that are plain pointless.It has some redeeming qualities, though these are more than negated by the farce. There is a theme of female empowerment and independence, but this is undermined by our independent and (wanting to be) empowered female deciding that the way to gain her independence was by putting a spell on her mother! Hardly the best lesson for girls.This movie (undeservedly) won the Best Animated Feature Oscar in 2013. How it beat Wreck-It-Ralph and Frankenweenie, both of which are far better movies, goodness knows.",4,1,2,8 December 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," All style, no substance, but reasonably entertaining
","All style, no substance, but reasonably entertaining.This movie, like many of today, revolves almost entirely around CGI, and outdoing everything that came before it in that regard. Plot is basic, and quite unoriginal, borrowing a lot from previous well- known sci fi movies and series. Dialogue is clichéd and tailored to kids. So many dad jokes...Performances are so-so, probably due to the lame script and having a director who only knows how to direct graphic designers, rather than actors...No, it is really about the CGI and that is done really well. Plus, the pace is good, and despite the unoriginality, the story does keep you engaged most of the time.Certainly no Citizen Kane, but it's okay.",6,4,9,18 December 2014
The Imitation Game," Good historical drama
","Good historical drama.The story of Alan Turing, the man who, in World War II, lead the team that cracked Germany's Enigma Code. His efforts went a long way to winning the war. The machine he developed to crack Engima was revolutionary, resulting in him being regarded as the father of computing.However, it's not all about this feat. Turing was homosexual and we see how this affects his life, especially post-WW2.Overall, a decent examination of the impact of this gifted man on society, with sub-plot on intolerance and injustice.Good performance by Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead role and by Keira Knightley. Both received Oscar nominations. Good support from Mark Strong, Charles Dance and Matthew Goode.Not a perfect movie though. Many of the details feel over- simplified and Hollywoodized. The military side, especially, is very simplistically told. This leaves the movie feeling a bit superficial and a bit too neat. Plus, for something that is one of the main plot points, his personal life seems to only get a passing mention, and only really comes to the fore towards the end.A longer movie, with a more detailed study of the man, was in order, I think.This said, what we have is very good, and surely enough to spark the curiosity of anyone with even a mild interest in history.",8,0,1,7 May 2015
The Evil Dead," A classic zombie movie
","A classic zombie movie.A group of friends - Ash, Cheryl, Scott, Linda and Shelly - head out to a remote cabin. The cabin has an eerie feeling and they soon discover some items left by previous occupants. One of the items is a strange book...I'm generally not a zombie movie fan (unless it's a good zombie- comedy, eg Zombieland, Warm Bodies). Zombie movies tend to be very unoriginal and predictable and usually consist of hordes of zombies chasing humans around, Benny Hill style, for large portion of the movie.However, The Evil Dead is different, and much better. Writer- director Sam Raimi builds the tension well and, even though you know there is zombieness coming, you don't know when, or how. Even once the zombies start appearing, it is not your usual random chase and fight scenes. The atmosphere is genuinely tense and scary.Production values are pretty poor, but that helps the movie, in a way. The cheap special effects heighten the sense of decay and abnormality of the situation.The movie made Raimi's career. Just a pity the follow-ups, Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness, didn't have the same originality and unpredictability, degenerating into zombie clichés (though they were still better than the average zombie movie)The movie also launched the career of Bruce Campbell, who starred as Ash. He would appear again, as Ash, in Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness.",7,0,2,27 February 2016
Shrek 2," Wonderfully funny and fun
","Wonderfully funny and fun.Picking up where the first Shrek movie left off, Shrek and Fiona are now happily married and living in Shrek's house in the swamp. Donkey reappears, much to Shrek and Fiona's annoyance. The King and Queen of Far Far Away hear of their daughter's (Fiona) marriage and invite Shrek and Fiona to the palace to celebrate. When the King discover's that Shrek is an ogre he is immediately opposed to the marriage. Prince Charming, who is determined to marry Fiona, appears and he and the King band together to separate Shrek and Fiona and get Fiona to marry Prince Charming. The Fairy Godmother also appears, and she is not as benevolent as you think.Good fun, with some great jokes. Mixes medieval settings with modern in-jokes and parodies. Quite clever, some of the jokes - definitely not just a movie for kids. Rollicks along at a good pace. There are some silly sub-plots but these don't consume too much of the time and are glossed over through the frenetic pace.Great use of well-known characters from children's fables, eg Puss in Boots, Pinocchio, The Three Little Pigs.Superb animation, as you would expect from DreamWorks. Spot-on voice casting too. Pick of the bunch, for me, is Jennifer Saunders as the Fairy Godmother. She gets some of the best lines and her deliver is brilliant.There is a large amount of music in the movie, not to the extent that it is a musical (thankfully), but enough to make it more than just background. The songs are a bit hit-and-miss. Some (eg Eels' 'I need some sleep') fit in well with the movie and help the tone, while others just feel like populist fluff. On the whole, the choice of music hinders more than helps the movie.Overall, an entertaining way to spend 1 1/2 hours or so.",7,0,1,14 May 2016
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Brilliant movie(s)
","(Review of Vol 1 and Vol 2).Brilliant movie(s).A young woman is shot and left for dead at her wedding. Her entire wedding party is massacred in cold blood. After four years in a coma she awakes and systematically sets out to wreak revenge on the people responsible, especially their leader, Bill...Fantastic movie in two parts, written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. Solid, original plot, good character depth, cool dialogue (as you would expect from Tarantino), good action scenes. Good use too of time-jumps, a Tarantino trademark.Good performances too.Of the two movies, I preferred Vol 2 to Vol 1 (though there is not much in it - Vol 2 is a 10, Vol 1 a 9). Vol 1 was more about action, with a massive fight scene towards the end. It had plot, but was more the start of a plot, with many loose threads.Vol 2 had plot development and character development and was less about action (though there was still enough of it). Thus more substance in Vol 2, more style in Vol 1, and substance beats style.",9,0,2,1 January 2016
Saw II," What I expected Saw 1 would be
","The original Saw movie was better than I expected. Expected it to be mostly gratuitous, sadistic, pointless violence. Had that, but also has a fair amount of intrigue and suspense.The movie built well, from the initial confusing, no-explanations- given, scene. Information was fed in in fragments. Even once the full picture is revealed, there are still a few good twists and blindsides.The second saw movie is more like what I was expecting - gratuitous gore and violence. Plot is more basic, almost token, and really just a vehicle to get to the next pointless gory scene.Unfortunately, it doesn't end there. The following Saw movies just got worse and worse.",4,3,5,16 July 2014

We see his childhood, the build up to him becoming Emperor, how the position is thrust upon him at a very young age and taken away, through revolution and forced abdication, when he was still a child. His life from then on is a roller-coaster ride, with many threats and ordeals.Interesting, edifying drama, sensitively told by director Bernardo Bertolucci. Quite an emotional journey.Lavish production, with colourful costumes and large sets. Not perfect. Does feel a bit slow at times.Won the 1988 Best Picture Oscar.",7,0,0,3 February 2017
Jerry Maguire," Schmaltzy but works...extremely well
","Schmaltzy but works...extremely well.A highly successful sports agent, Jerry Maquire (played by Tom Cruise), starts to realise how cynical and superficial his job and industry are. In a moment of inspiration he drafts a manifesto, noting what is wrong with the industry and how it should change. For his forthrightness he is fired. All he has left is one client, Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr), and his new agency only has one other employee - a former colleague, Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger).The movie that propelled writer-director Cameron Crowe into the cinematic big league. The first movie he directed, Say Anything..., was great but low-key. Jerry Maguire, his third movie, was even better and was a big deal.Emotionally manipulative but very enjoyable movie. Nice, feel-good, underdog story with heart. Quite funny too, at times. Fairly profound too - some good comments on the superficiality and cynicism of modern sport, business and society.Tom Cruise is in fine form as Jerry Maguire. He plays his ideal role - charming, dynamic and heroic. He got a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his performance.However, the performance that glues everything together, grounds the movie and prevents it from being too syrupy, plus provides the most entertainment, is that of Cuba Gooding Jr. Great work on his part - over-the-top and funny. He deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar.Good work too from Renee Zellweger and Jonathan Lipnicki (as her child).Excellent soundtrack too, as you would expect from Cameron Crowe, him having been a Rolling Stone music reporter in the 1970s.Great entertainment.",9,0,0,31 January 2016

","Interesting but slow, long and clumsy.The story of two childhood friends with a love for the sea and diving. They drift apart but are reunited by the competitive world of free diving. Their eagerness to set new depth records drives them to incredible feats, and great danger...Starts off quite amateurishly. The childhood scenes and the acting therein is quite badly done. However, it gets better after that and the plot is interesting enough. It never does shake that clumsy amateurishness present in the first few scenes though.Is very slow and overly long too. Far too many scenes in the movie that could easily have been cut or at least edited somewhat.Performances are mostly OK, but not brilliant. Nobody really stands out. Jean Reno is probably the best of the bunch.",6,3,8,31 August 2015
Jurassic World," Incredibly predictable, formulaic and cheesy
","Incredibly predictable, formulaic and cheesy.22 years after Jurassic Park failed, a new park, Jurassic World, opens on an island. Complete with rides, free range dinosaurs and a monstrous king of dinosaurs, what could possibly go wrong (again)...?I wasn't a fan of Jurassic Park and Jurassic World just seems like the same central plot, set in a different location, with different characters and 2015 CGI. Plot is pretty basic - humans develop dinosaurs from DNA, put them in a park, they run amok (much scenes of humans being gobbled) but are somehow defeated. Oh, and throw in some out-of-the-blue, no context, implausible romance too, in case the movie wasn't stupid enough.Characters are one-dimensional and pretty much cardboard cutouts of your your standard action/horror movie categories. There's the sensitive hero, the neutral party who becomes a hero, the well- meaning person who causes the calamity (and tends to die), the unlikable guy who you know is going to meet a sticky end at the hand of the dinosaurs, a wise ass who makes heaps of cynical quips but never contributes anything constructive, hapless kids, other innocents caught in the middle whose survival depends on how innocent they actually are, and/or how nondescript they are (more nondescript means more expendable).There's a pretense of setting the scene for the movie, but this really just wastes time and pads the film. We all know that the dinosaurs are going to start munching on humans at some point, so get to it! If you're going to make a crap movie, make a short movie!Nothing to like about this movie.",2,4,11,22 April 2016

He sets out to the city to find some warrior bugs to fight the grasshoppers. Hew returns with an assortment of characters he believes will be enough to battle the ant's oppressors, only to find that they're a troupe of circus performers.Okayish. Starts interestingly and originally enough: the mixing of the traits of the various bugs with human qualities was initially quite funny and clever. However, this wears off pretty quickly as this becomes the writer-directors' go-to form of humour.Similarly, the plot is initially quite interesting but soon degenerates into pretty basic action-comedy stuff.It all feels so predictable and basic after a while.This said, it is reasonably fun and does have some good comedic moments. Kids will love it.",5,1,1,30 April 2020
Prisoners," Superb crime-drama
","Superb crime-drama.Solid, clever plot. Due to the complexity of it, I kept waiting for something to not fit in, for a hole in the script, but it never came. Things that seemed random and unrelated (eg the priest) all had a purpose and made sense, in the end.Good direction from Denis Villeneuve (who also directed the great drama Incendies). Builds the suspense well, and keeps you engaged the whole time. You would not know the movie is nearly 2 1/2 hours long it is so gripping and suspenseful and flows so well.Solid performance from Hugh Jackman. However, he is upstaged by Jake Gyllenhaal as the detective. Fantastic performance by him.

","1630s. Christians in Japan are being persecuted and news now reaches Lisbon that the senior Jesuit priest in Japan, Padre Ferreira, has renounced his faith. Two Jesuit priests set out to Japan to not only find Ferreira but also to continue his ministry. Interesting drama, directed by Martin Scorsese. Quite gritty in its depiction of the persecution Christians faced, as well as the dilemmas they faced. The moral quandaries of the priests when faced with torture and death, not only of themselves of their flock, are explored well. Some good themes covered, especially faith and what one has to do to remain true to it. Powerful ending.However, far from perfect. The movie moves at a glacial pace and is quite long-winded and verbose: many themes and dilemmas are repeated unnecessarily. Quite difficult to remain engaged and focussed when things happen so slowly. Some editing would have gone a long way.",6,1,3,15 April 2018
Logan," Great movie, even if you're not an X-Men follower
","It is 2029. The X-Men are no more and no mutants have been born in 25 years. Logan (Wolverine), his health weakening, now works as a chauffeur in Texas. The ailing Charles Xavier / Professor X is living in an abandoned industrial plant where he is cared for by Caliban, a former mutant tracker. Logan visits occasionally, providing medicine for Xavier's condition. Logan is approached by a woman, Gabriela, who asks him to drive her and her daughter to a certain location in North Dakota. Gabriela is then murdered but this is not the end of it for Logan as the target is the daughter who appears to have special, mutant-like, powers.I'm not an X-Men fan and only have a basic knowledge of the characters and plot of the X-Men series. However, to my surprise, not only is Logan very accessible even if you know nothing about X- Men or Wolverine, it is actually a very good movie.Solid, interesting plot. As mentioned, you don't need to know anything about X-Men and what you do need to know is covered in the movie. Decent character depth and good plot development, making for an engaging story.Good action scenes and a poetic, emotional ending.A pleasant surprise.",8,3,6,1 October 2017
Big Fish," Moving and visually stunning
","Moving and visually amazing drama from Tim Burton. Burton is renowned for his quirky comedies but here he manages to mix that with raw emotion. A family relationship drama mixed with fairy tales (or are they?).As you would expect from Tim Burton, the special effects are amazing. Throw in a good soundtrack (by Danny Elfman, of course) and you have a well-crafted, visually appealing, often light-hearted yet emotional movie.Good performances by a host of stars: Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Jessica Lange, Billy Cradup, Helena Bonham Carter, Marion Cotillard, Robert Guillaume, Danny DeVito, Alison Lohman and Steve Buscemi. Also includes a 10-year old Miley Cyrus in her first cinema movie role (though I am not sure this is anything for the movie to be proud of...).Only negative is that the ending lacks punch. Having set up the intrigue with the interesting tales and snippets of the father's life, the conclusion is not that profound and feels a bit predictable. It's as if Burton focused most of his attention on the first and second Acts and relaxed on the third.",8,0,0,15 March 2014
Major League," Funny, engaging and entertaining
","Rachel Phelps is the new owner of the Cleveland Indians baseball team. However, her plans for the team are rather nefarious. She wants to move the team to Miami for the warmer climate and a new stadium. To justify the move, the team has to lose, and lose badly. So she assembles the worst possible team she can. Among these are a past-his-prime catcher with bad knees, a shrewd but past-his-prime pitcher, a young tearaway pitcher (and felon) with a 100 mph fastball but absolutely no control, a third baseman who is too wealthy and precious to dive, a voodoo-loving slugger who can't hit a curveball and an energetic-but-naive lead off hitter and base- stealer who can't keep the ball on the ground. Against the odds, and after the inevitable initial failures, they iron out some of their faults and start to win, much to Ms Phelps' consternation. Great baseball movie. Plot is your standard sport fairy tale - a non-hoper team's rise against adversity. While the result is a bit predictable, the journey is very entertaining. Very funny, with some wonderfully diverse and idiosyncratic characters.Very engaging too. Even though you suspect you know how things are going to pan out, nothing is certain and you get swept along with the movies boundless energy.One of the best sports comedies, if not sports movies, you'll see.",8,0,2,26 November 2016

In particular the lives of the two main protagonists, the legendary Harry Vardon, the first superstar of golf, and the unheralded Francis Ouimet. Shows what lead them to that event, and their personal drivers and demons.An exciting telling of an actual event. You're kept on tenterhooks until the very end. The backstories are interesting too. Solid performances from Shia LeBeouf and Stephen Dillane in the lead roles.On the downside, this is Disney, so some of the characters and plot are dumbed-down for kids. The villains are stereotypical, predictable and one-dimensional. Some occurrences don't make complete sense, especially from a golf perspective and have been changed for dramatic purposes. Fortunately, Disney doesn't overdo the stereotypes and dramatizations, so they don't detract from the movie too much.",8,0,0,29 November 2015
Annie Hall," One of the greatest movies ever made
","One of the greatest movies ever made. The 1978 Best Picture Oscar winner, Woody Allen's magnum opus is brilliant, and works on so many levels. In the vein of Allen's previous movies, it is a screamingly funny comedy, complete with physical, situational and intellectual humour. However, this is also a drama, which was a bit of a departure for Allen. As a drama, a relationship-drama to be exact, it works just fine too. Neatly sums up the ups and downs, neuroses, hurdles and over-thinking that are part of modern-day relationships.Great performances by Woody Allen and Diane Keaton in the lead roles. Keaton won an Oscar for her performance and Allen got his only ever performance Oscar nomination.Good support from Tony Roberts. Cast also includes Paul Simon, Christopher Walken in a minor role and Jeff Goldblum in a 5-second, one-line role.The movie was a watershed movie for Woody Allen. None of his previous movies, which were all essentially slapstick comedies, had received an Oscar nomination. Annie Hall got 5 nominations and won 4 of them. From then on we had Woody Allen's unique blend of comedy and drama, a formula which saw him garner another 25 Oscar nominations, including 2 wins.",10,0,0,6 May 2015

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Insanely original and intelligent movie
","Insanely original and intelligent movie.A man, Joel (played by Jim Carrey), discovers that his ex- girlfriend, Clementine (played by Kate Winslet), recently had all memories of him erased from her memory. He decides to do the same. However, halfway through the procedure, he has second thoughts. What follows is a cat-and-mouse game as he tries to hide memories of her within his brain, to prevent the erasers getting to them.Directed by Michel Gondry and co-written by Gondry and Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind), this movie has to be one of the most intelligent ever made. Not only clever, but the plot is watertight. Many writers and directors try to be too clever and simply end up with a hole-ridden script as a result. Not so in this case.There's also a great emotional aspect and profundity to this movie. The movie examines what memories mean to us as humans and the benefits and disadvantages of them, and comes up with some interesting conclusions. The relationship between Joel and Clementine is quite moving too.Superb performances by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet in the lead roles. Good support from Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo and Kirsten Dunst.An absolute must-see.",10,0,2,21 December 2015
Elysium," Irritating, for many reasons
","Neil Blomkamp's debut cinema movie, District 9, was great and received much critical acclaim, as well as four Oscar nominations. This, his second movie, is not anywhere near as good.Not just bad, irritating, and for many reasons. What should be a harmless sci fi action -drama is turned into a political diatribe on the haves vs the have-nots and how evil wealthy people are. Also, there is appears to be some sort of pro-illegal alien agenda. Even if you ignore the political agendas, the movie is still pretty bad. Quite formulaic, implausible plot. Fairly predictable in the end.Then we have the casting. Matt Damon is totally miscast as a tattooed criminal. Yes, he is the hero, ultimately, a role he plays well, but the criminal side just didn't work. Similarly, Jodie Foster as he scheming executive also didn't feel right. Worse than that, her accent was incredibly irritating and unnatural, grating like nails on a blackboard.On the plus side, the South African mercenaries were good fun, and had some of the best lines. Always good to hear South African slang (this coming from an ex-South African).Hopefully Neil Blomkamp rediscovers his District 9 mojo in his third movie.",3,0,1,16 May 2014

Nothing new for director Sergio Leone, however: his westerns tend to be overly drawn-out too.Pretty lame title too.

This is the outcome: a rock documentary - a rockumentary. Through interviews of the band he covers their history and creative processes, and captures some of their behind-the-scenes interactions. He also films some of their concerts and music. There's a reason they're not that well known...One of the funniest movies ever made. A great spoof of rock music, and the music industry in general. Just about every scene and line is iconic and quotable (eg 'Our amps go up to eleven', the saga of the drummers). Very relatable too, especially to anyone who follows rock music. So many scenes that remind you just how superficial, pretentious and sometimes plain stupid rock musicians can be. Cringingly close to reality at times.Brilliant beyond description. So good this movie created a genre - the mockumentary.",10,0,2,28 January 2016

","OK, but not great. Story was very linear and conventional. I was expecting over-the-top zaniness, but it didn't really happen. The first half was good, but once the novelty of 3D wore off, I got bored.If ever Tim Burton had a licence to make a weird insane movie, it is here, but he seemed to hold back. It's as if he expected that the visual effects would be enough to carry the movie, but they aren't.Don't get me wrong, the visual effects are good, but CGI should never be the making of a movie (James Cameron, take note). Even then, the CGI and 3D here are not brilliant and contain a few flaws (as an example, look at any moving shot of Stayne / Crispin Glover, especially on a horse).In keeping with his director, Johnny Depp seemed oddly restrained. His performance was mediocre-to-flat. Mia Wasikowska has the most screen time, obviously, and does OK, especially for someone so young and inexperienced.Not bad, but definitely not a must-see. Kids should enjoy it a lot though.",5,0,0,6 March 2014

The greeny/anti-capitalism/anti-imperialism themes are laid on so thick you can't help but support the 'bad' guys.Characters are hardly developed at all, so you have very little empathy for them. And to top it all off, the movie goes on for 160 minutes! Once the novelty of the great CGI has worn off, it quickly starts to drift and gets boring. James Cameron could have left it at about 100 minutes, and not missed anything. There are several scenes that add nothing to the movie, except for Cameron to gratuitously show off his CGI prowess, again. Surely one of the most over-rated movies of all time.",4,2,4,19 April 2014

Victory," Not great, but entertaining
","A good, but not great movie. However, despite its flaws it is quite entertaining.Interesting idea: Allied POWs in WW2 get to play a soccer (/football...) match against the Germans. As a sub-plot, the soccer match is going to be used as a means to escape.Escape-from-POW Camp movies are not a novel idea. However, the Allies vs Germans soccer match adds quite an original twist to the concept.Plot is OK, but not entirely waterproof and does feel quite contrived at times. The good guys vs bad guys stereotypes are laid on rather thick, though Max von Sydow's character adds a bit of balance.Performances are varied. Many of the actors are actually soccer stars (eg Pele, Bobby Moore - basically the entire Allied team except for Michael Caine and Sylvester Stallone) so not there for their acting abilities (except in the penalty area...). Caine gives a solid performance in the lead role. Stallone is his usual monosyllabic, one-dimensional self. The soccer players probably give better performances than him...So, overall, has a trite and hammy feel to it. Nowhere near John Huston's best works as a director. However, flows well, never loses momentum and is quite entertaining.",7,0,0,25 November 2014

Had some potential to poke fun at some aspects of the music industry, or at least show what life in a band is like, but doesn't really use these opportunities.However, is very funny at times. The humour is dry, and often not obvious. Physical comedy this is not, despite the aforementioned fake- headed singer.Ultimately, likable but not substantial. Lacked any great themes.

Grindhouse," Death Proof - highly entertaining; Planet Terror - disappointing
","Death Proof: 8/10Very entertaining and action-filled.Good drama and fun, with some good action scenes. Has the depth of character and amusing conversations and diversions that make Tarantino movies so special.However, not as multi-faceted as any of his other movies, and a deliberate attempt to make a B-grade movie, this is Tarantino's worst movie yet. Not that it is bad, just not as good as any of his other stuff, and considering that 'other stuff' includes some of the greatest movies ever made - Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill - this is not a great insult.
Planet Terror: 2/10Disappointing.I liked the Quentin Tarantino contribution to the Grindhouse pair of movies, 'Death Proof'. I have always been more of a Tarantino fan than Robert Rodriguez, but thought 'Sin City' was brilliant and expected at least something entertaining for 'Planet Terror'. No, it is incredibly lame.Plot is full of holes, action sequences are incredibly contrived, acting is wooden.I realise that this was a homage to the Z-grade cheap horror Grindhouse movies of the 70s, but Rodriguez didn't have to be so faithful to the genre and make a crap movie.",5,0,3,23 May 2019
The Artist," Great movie
","Great movie. Filmed entirely without dialogue or sound effects other than the score (well, almost entirely, but I don't want to give anything away). In addition, not all of the dialogue is then sub-titled. Thus, rather than being spoon-fed the plot, you have to use your brain and your imagination. Makes a change from the majority of modern movies where you are walked through the plot, inch by inch, and it mostly consists of things being blown up, in vivid fashion, anyway! The director's use of symbolism helps the plot along. Admittedly, the plot isn't that complex, so the brain won't be too taxed (hence the 9/10 rather than 10/10). Great performance from Jean Dujardin in the lead role, well supported by Berenice Bejo, John Goodman and James Cromwell. However, the stand-out performance comes from Uggie, the dog. He deserves an Oscar.Like Hugo, an homage to the art of movie-making.",9,1,6,27 January 2015

More particularly, the thinking appeared to be that bodybuilders make good rugby players, and casting were made accordingly.Morgan Freeman is great as Nelson Mandela, capturing his mannerisms well. Matt Damon is atrocious as Francois Pienaar, especially in physical appearance. Other than the rugby players, the supporting cast put in good performances.Not quite a classic, but a very good attempt at one, and Clint Eastwood is allowed to miss every now and again.",8,0,2,25 January 2015
La La Land," Not simply just a musical or a romantic drama - this is so much better than that
","Mia (played by Emma Stone) is an aspiring actress, working in a coffee shop. She gets auditions but nothing has come of these. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) is a struggling jazz pianist, playing small venues. His dream is to open his own jazz club. The two meet, but don't hit it off. Over time, however, things change...I generally dislike musicals and romantic dramas. Romantic dramas tend to be incredibly formulaic, schmaltzy and unrealistic. Musicals are irritating because instead of spoken dialogue you have someone singing words at you, and it all seems so contrived and out of place (thus is if you're lucky. Many musicals just use music as padding).So it is with some trepidation that I watched La La Land. The opening few scenes didn't help my fear that this was going to be a campy West Side Story-like implausible song-and-dance fest or a Les Miserables-like constant stream of nails-on-blackboard irritation.However, it soon became clear that La La Land is better than that. The answer to 'How much better?' increases the more into the movie you get.What sustains the movie initially is its warmth: the wonderful, often-funny dialogue and the interaction between the two main characters. The chemistry between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is fantastic and their performances (especially Emma Stone's) alone are worth the price of admission.Even the music is okay - sporadically used, not as intrusive as it could have been and it seems to integrate into the plot well. Moreover, rather than just serve as padding, it helps move the plot along. (This all said, I would have preferred genuine dialogue!). At this point the movie was still heading down a rather safe, predictable 'boy meets girl...yadda yadda...happily ever after' route. The stuff of easy box office dollars rather than genuine art.Then writer-director Damien Chazelle (of Whiplash fame) ups the ante, moving it from a mere romantic drama to a drama that covers a host of themes - artistic integrity, the price of fame, chasing dreams, the trade-offs between relationships and careers, missed opportunities and life's big 'what if?' moments. An incredibly emotional, bitter-sweet ending ties it all together perfectly. What appeared to be a quaint-yet-innocuous film turned into a wonderfully profound, hard-hitting work of art.",9,2,8,9 January 2017
Saw," Better than expected
","Better than I expected. Expected it to be mostly gratuitous, sadistic, pointless violence. Has that, but also has a fair amount of intrigue and suspense.The movie builds well, from the initial confusing, no-explanations- given, scene. Information is fed in in fragments. Even once the full picture is revealed, there are still a few good twists and blindsides.Last few scenes are incredibly suspenseful, with no clear conclusion.The amount of violence and gore does detract from this however. It is often gratuitous.Overall, a watchable movie, with a decent plot. It is the subsequent sequels that turned it into 100% gratuitous sadistic violence. Trust Hollywood to ruin a decent movie by making heaps of mindless sequels.",6,0,2,12 July 2014
Super 8," Conventional, dullish, unoriginal and derivative
","More evidence that modern action-dramas are more about marketing and hype (and special effects) than quality. An average movie, derivative of Close Encounters of the Third Kind (ironically, as Steven Spielberg is a producer), Alien and Stand By Me, though with nothing approaching the quality of those movies. Conventional, dullish, unoriginal story. Direction by JJ Abrams, of his own script, is solid. Performances are so-so.Will appeal to kids - judging by the age of the characters I assume that is who it is aimed at anyway. Otherwise, not worth seeing. Watch Alien, Close Encounters of The Third Kind or Stand by Me instead.",5,1,1,23 July 2015
Up," Brilliant
","Brilliant. May seem like a movie for kids, being animated, but it is much much more than that. Good plot that is more than a linear action- adventure. Deeply moving, proving that is more than a kids movie. The character exposition and development side is wonderful, and it starts like that. First 15 minutes are very emotional.Superb animation. The colours are rich and vibrant. CGI does not make a movie on its own (James Cameron take note) but here it certainly enriches the experience.An absolute classic.",10,0,2,13 February 2014
A Clockwork Orange," Kubrick's brilliant, darkly-funny, subversive masterpiece
","Kubrick's brilliant, darkly-funny, subversive masterpiece.Set in the UK in the then-present-time but with some futuristic elements to it, a young man, Alex (played by Malcolm McDowell), is the Beethoven-loving leader of a gang of hedonistic, immoral thugs. They beat up people for fun, fight with other gangs, sexually assault women, break into houses and generally terrorise average citizens without any feeling. Then one day, Alex kills one of their victims and is immediately caught by the Police. He is sent to prison for 14 years. In prison he learns of a Pavlov-like experiment to rehabilitate and reprogram incarcerated criminals... Searingly brilliant. Master director Stanley Kubrick pulls out all the stops in adapting Anthony Burgess' weird, fantastical, thought- provoking and dark novel to the silver screen. While the subject matter is dark, the approach is quite light and funny, resulting in a morbidly humorous movie. Quite Pythonesque at times in its inanity and dark humour.Not just comedic, there is drama aplenty and many themes at play. There's a wonderfully subversive element to the movie - the government is shown to be a bunch of incompetent nanny-state morons (though we already knew that...), authority figures in general are shown to be out of touch with reality and, on a minor note, we see who tend to become policemen... There's also a theme of free-will vs conditioned response.Or you could just view it purely as entertainment and enjoy it anyway. It works on many different levels.An excellent score contributes to the feel of the movie - Kubrick uses it well to set the mood for the scenes. It contributes particularly well to making dark moments much lighter.There's also the attention to detail we expect from Kubrick, complete with an Easter Egg or two. Spot the 2001: A Space Odyssey soundtrack in the record shop scene...Excellent performance by Malcolm McDowell in the lead role. He captures the tone of the movie perfectly. Good supporting cast too.One of the greatest movies ever made.",10,3,4,11 March 2016
Stalingrad," Gritty WW2 drama
","Gritty WW2 drama.August 1942. A German combat engineer platoon is resting and recuperating in Italy after fighting in North Africa. Their Lieutenant was badly wounded in the fighting and a new, green, platoon commander, Lt Hans van Witzland, has just taken command. The platoon is soon to be attached to an elite unit and sent to a place synonymous with carnage and destruction on a massive scale. An operation that marked a turning point of World War 2. Stalingrad.A good depiction of the Battle of Stalingrad, told from the German perspective and on a small unit scale. Accurately depicts the callous disregard for human life, the terror, the sheer futility and, ultimately, foolhardiness of the Battle of Stalingrad. Quite novel too, a German telling of the battle, a battle that they suffered massive losses in, ultimately lost and, as a result, ultimately lost WW2.Not perfect. Character engagement is a bit limited - you don't feel as much for the individual soldiers as you should. There's a breathless feeling of action scene after action scene without any time to reflect, or get to know the characters better.",8,0,1,30 April 2016
The Legend of 1900," Interesting concept, not well used
","1900. Danny Boodmann, a stoker on an American passenger liner, Virginian, finds a baby abandoned on the ship. He names the child Danny Boodmann T.D. Lemon Nineteen Hundred '1900' and raises the child as his own until his death in an accident on the ship. The child never leaves the ship and turns out to be a musical genius, especially when it comes to playing the piano. As an adult he befriends a trumpet player in the ship's band, Max Tooney. After several years on the ship Max leaves, and tells the story of 1900 to the owner of a music store.Interesting concept, not well used. The idea of a man who has never set foot on land, whose whole world is one ship and cannot relate to the world outside was a very original and promising one. However, the story really doesn't explore any of these themes well. The story is quite superficial, full of empty, devoid of context sentimentality and contrived, implausible situations. It's a simple linear storyline with faux-sentimental, style-over-substance scenes dropped in.Even the tone is wrong. The movie is often cartoonish in its sub- plots and characters. What was needed was gravitas, not cheap thrills.The conclusion does provide some insights into 1900's motivations and outlook on life but still isn't that profound.This all said, the storyline was reasonably interesting and there is some good tension towards the end.Solid work by Tim Roth in the lead role. Pruitt Taylor Vince is a touch unconvincing and irritating as Max Tooney. The lack of gravitas is almost entirely his, or at least his character's, doing. Supporting cast are fine.Ultimately, a reasonably interesting plot but nothing more than that.",6,2,5,21 May 2016

Reservoir Dogs," Superb - one of the greatest movies ever made
","A crime boss assembles a team of six experienced criminals to pull off a large jewellery heist. However, it goes badly and the team are ambushed by police. The survivors regroup at an abandoned warehouse where it becomes obvious to them that someone in the team is an undercover cop. But which one?Brilliant crime-drama. With a meagre budget, Quentin Tarantino made a masterpiece. Have watched Reservoir Dogs five or six times now and it never gets old or loses its impact, despite knowing how it's going to turn out. If anything, it gets better with each watching, as I spot little things I didn't see the previous times.All the Tarantino trademarks are there: the witty dialogue, gritty characters, graphic violence, elaborate and detailed - yet watertight - plot, the character development, the backwards-and-forwards-in-time effects, the excellent, well selected soundtrack.Tarantino's work behind the camera is the sort of magic that gets examined in film schools. The low budget probably helped - when you don't have special effects and all other expensive means at your disposal, you need to maximize the effect of what you have. Certainly the greatest ever directorial debut (if it is regarded as Tarantino's debut).Casting was spot on, and every actor plays out of his skin. Nothing seems forced, and the characters gel perfectly - you wouldn't even know anyone was acting.Considering the perfection of this movie, it is quite amazing that Tarantino managed to surpass it with his next movie, making the greatest movie of all time: Pulp Fiction.",10,0,0,19 April 2014
Love & Mercy," Great look inside the mind of a tortured genius
","The story of Brian Wilson, the creative force behind the Beach Boys. Most particularly the movie focuses on the mental issues he had, how these affected his creativity, relationships and life. The story is told from two periods in his life - the mid-60s, when the Beach Boys were at their peak and the late-80s/early-90s when Wilson is under the control of Dr Eugene Landy, whose diagnosis, motives and methods are rather dubious. In this latter period we also meet Melinda Ledbetter, a woman who Brian Wilson has a relationship with and who may be his salvation.Great movie. A good look inside the mind of a tortured genius. We see the amount of creativity and musicality present in Brian Wilson and it is staggering. A musical genius whose genius may well have been his undoing. There's a fine line between genius and madman.The creativity part is largely covered in the 60s part, where Wilson is superbly played by Paul Dano.The 80s/90s part is more about the abuse he suffered at the hands of Dr Landy and also his relationship with Melinda Ledbetter. While John Cusack (in his first decent role, and best performance, in several years) gives a solid performance as Wilson this part is less effective than the 60s part. Not bad, just doesn't have the same momentum and feel as the 60s part, feeling more negative and a bit clumsy. Good work by Elizabeth Banks as Ledbetter though.Overall, a very good representation of two crucial points in Brian Wilson's life. Good have been even better if the movie had concentrated on one of the two, as it feels a bit diluted in its current form.",8,2,3,6 August 2016

Unfortunately, his father is the chief of the village, and that just makes things worse. Then he befriends a massive dragon. Dragons are the sworn enemies of his village...Good fun with a sweet, feel-good message. Didn't always look that way: in the beginning it seemed like your average animated action movie. However, from a point (that point being where he meets the dragon), things kick up a gear. The movie then becomes a story about a boy and his dragon friend / pet, and this adds a another dimension to the plot.Good animation and decent voice work, though not sure why all the adults had to be Scottish...",7,0,0,10 January 2016
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Despite the shock value and controversy, quite empty and dull
","Nazi-Fascist Northern Italy, 1943-44. Four senior members of government, aided by henchmen and Nazi soldiers, kidnap a group of young men and women. They hold them for 120 days, subjecting them to all manner of torture, perversion and degradation.One of the most controversial and shocking movies of all times. Salo's reputation precedes it, which diminishes some its shock value. This said, there are still quite a few scenes that, no matter how prepared you are for them, are quite disgusting.However, despite the shock value and controversy, the film is quite empty and dull. The story is threadbare, seeming to just lurch from one gross-out scene to another. For all of director Pier Paulo Passolini's intentions to mock fascism and tyrannical government in general, this does very little to coherently expose or condemn it.I was hoping for a moment of profundity towards the end, maybe a comeuppance. This would have tied everything together and made the journey worthwhile. Sadly, nothing like that in sight. The ending is anticlimactic and, like the rest of the movie, pointless.Only worth watching to see what all the fuss was about.",3,5,11,10 September 2016
Total Recall," Entertaining sci fi action-drama
","Entertaining sci fi action-drama.Set in the future, a man, Douglas Quaid (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger), is plagued by dreams that he is living an parallel life on Mars. (Mars has been colonised by Earth but is undergoing a civil war of sorts). Upon seeing an advert, he goes to Rekall Inc to take a virtual holiday on Mars through implanted memories in his brain. This sets off a chain of events, leading him to realise that he may have actually been on Mars before...Clever and well thought out central plot, based on a short story by Philip K Dick, writer of books and short stories on which movies such as Blade Runner, Minority Report, A Scanner Darkly, Paycheck and The Adjustment Bureau have been based.Direction by Paul Verhoeven is uneven. Special effects and action sequences are great and most scenes are decently directed. However, some plot developments feel a bit clumsy and contrived. Not the smoothest, most seamless direction. With Arnold Schwarzenegger in the lead role, you know not expect too much in the acting stakes. However, despite having more dialogue than in the Terminator movies, Arnie does a reasonable job here. Hardly Brandoesque, but it'll do. Besides, he's there as an action hero and in the action scenes he does very well.Solid performances from the main supporting cast: Sharon Stone, Rachel Ticotin, Michael Ironside, Ronny Cox. Some of the secondary supporting performances feel a bit hammy though, especially Mel Johnson Jr as Benny and Michael Champion as Helm.Overall, good entertainment and far better than the 2012 remake.",7,0,0,3 April 2016

Rocky," Vastly overrated
","Vastly overrated.Not sure how this got to be regarded so highly, and won the Best Picture Oscar in 1977. Story isn't too plausible and is quite dull in spells. The opening setup was interesting, as it painted a picture of a man in a dead-end situation. But then, just when you think the movie is going to be how he gradually works himself out of that situation, it turns out that it is all about winning a lottery, rather than hard work, essentially.The only thing that made it watchable after that was the fight scene, right at the end. The Rocky-Adrian relationship is implausible, contrived and clumsy.To add insult to injury, Sylvester Stallone got a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his series of monosyllabic grunts that pass for dialogue. In total Rocky received three Academy awards plus seven other nominations. Of these, only the nomination for Best Original Song was deserved.

The Red Violin," Interesting, engaging and emotional drama
","The rare Red Violin is up for auction in Montreal. Through a series of five different stories, dating from different periods of time, ranging from 1681 to the present, we see the history of the violin and how it touched the lives of many people.Great drama. The five stories are interesting in themselves, as independent tales. Quite engaging and emotional at times. The fact that the violin links all these stories together just makes it even more interesting.We also have the investigation into whether the violin is the real item. This makes for intriguing viewing as it is like a police investigation.Not perfect though. The ending feels a bit lacklustre: I was expecting something more profound but instead the writer and director went with a more mainsteam conclusion. In addition, Samuel L Jackson, action star, seems miscast as the violin appraiser. I guess he was there for the star power, to get audiences in the door. He is not terrible, but a decent dramatic actor would have done a much better job.",8,1,1,4 May 2020

She is given very little information about the methods or aims of the task force, except that it is going after senior members of a Mexican drug cartel. She soon realises that their methods are quite unorthodox, even potentially illegal, and the aim may be even more unconventional.Great action-thriller, directed by Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Incendies). Slow-burning intensity with a great deal of intrigue. Not your average cops-and-drug-dealers story in that, like the lead character, the viewer is kept in the dark about much of the objectives of the mission. This keeps you guessing and makes the reveal even more profound in its impact.Great, realistic action scenes and good special effects.After showing herself to be a very good action performer in Edge of Tomorrow, Emily Blunt gets another opportunity to further those credentials. Less action for her in this, but enough, and she does well. I can see her being the go-to female action star for a few years to come.Good support from Josh Brolin, Benicio Del Toro and Daniel Kaluuya.The end message is a bit unsatisfactory and the target for derision too easy, and those would be the main negatives. Otherwise, a very good movie.",8,1,2,1 August 2016

Is he cut out for this and what will his wife and friends think?Great movie. Engaging story, as we follow Daigo and how his unexpected, and largely unwanted, role changes his life. Quite emotional as we see the effect his work has on people, how people respond to knowing this is the last they'll see of a loved one and how death can leave to recriminations and falling outs among family and friends.Thought-provoking, as we are left to ponder our own lives and how we handle death.Won the Best Foreign Film Oscar in 2009.",8,0,0,16 September 2018

Inside Man," Okay, but had the potential to be brilliant
","A gang holds up a bank, takes hostages and is trapped inside the bank by police. A police hostage negotiator arrives and takes charge but the gang don't seem to be following the usual playbook. Even more mysteriously, the chairman of the bank has hired his own negotiator.Intriguing and riveting...initially. The movie was set up to be a great heist drama, with a large dose of mystery thrown in. I was looking forward to see the course of events unfold and the puzzle be solved (or, even better, figure it out myself).Unfortunately, the level of intrigue and uncertainty reduces almost immediately as we have flash-forwards that give away elements of the outcome of the bank siege. From a point you can see how the siege is going to pan out.The bank chairman / private negotiator aspect, something which I initially thought was unnecessary and just detracted from the main story, becomes more important and adds intrigue, but it also serves to muddy the plot somewhat. More disappointingly, this sub-plot becomes the main plot and results in a unsatisfactory, smug, moralising conclusion.Overall, interesting enough but also quite disappointing as it could have been so much better.",6,10,12,26 December 2019
Pulp Fiction," Brilliant beyond comparison
","Brilliant beyond comparison.Set in the world of LA gangsters, the intertwining stories of two gangsters, their boss, his wife, a boxer...and a couple who hold up restaurants. From the outset, the stories are clearly not parallel, but don't appear that closely linked either. However, they all eventually coalesce...though not necessarily in chronological order...A mind-blowingly brilliant movie from master-writer-director Quentin Tarantino. This was his second feature film, after the almost-as- brilliant Reservoir Dogs. While Reservoir Dogs was a film noir-type crime-drama, Pulp Fiction created a new genre (and prompted many attempts at copying Tarantino's style). Pulp Fiction has the film noir elements - the gritty crime-drama, the clever, solid plot, the hard-edged characters. Yet is has even more: great humour, incredibly snappy and clever dialogue, the coolest, swaggering characters and clever little sub- plots.

That is the only positive thing about the movie.I generally dislike musicals (though there are some exceptions) and this has to be one of the more irritating ones. No dialogue at all, all music, written badly, sung badly. The music sounds like someone took dialogue and tried to make it into music - the tunes sound so contrived. Other than Hugh Jackman, none of the cast can really sing, which makes it worse.As for the plot, it became more and more difficult to follow, as one had to listen to the horrible songs to figure our what was going on. What I did pick up was incredibly over-convoluted.I lasted 80 minutes, with gritted teeth and tortured ears, then gave up.How this got so many Oscar nominations (incl Best Picture) and three wins, Heaven only knows.

Just basically drifts for 3.25 hours around that central plot. The direction is all about the amazing special effects, another Cameron trademark.On the plus side, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are excellent in the lead roles, and their interaction is spot-on.

","Rocky is one of the most overrated movies of all time. Implausible plot, often dull and with some of the worst performances you'll see in a movie: from the over-the-top acting of Burgess Meredith to the monosyllabic, IQ-reducing grunts of Sylvester Stallone. Only Talia Shire was convincing.Only thing that made it watchable was the occasional humour, the introductory scenes and the final fight scene.Rocky II was more of the same. Human drama for 90% of the film, followed by an intense fight scene. This time, however, the human drama side is more realistic and engaging and the movie flows better for it. Still not great, as it all feels kind of predictable, but it is less dull than the first movie.Rocky III pretty much just follows the same formula. Change the guy Rocky has to fight, rinse and repeat. Only difference here is that we have two fights - one in mid-movie, one at the end.I like the idea of a serialized account of Rocky's life, but this doesn't really add anything original to the series.",4,0,3,12 April 2015

A great study in human reaction to tragedy.Doesn't have a very satisfactory ending, however. After all the careful build-up, the ending feels rushed and too open-ended.

You can't put this down to being made in the 1980s - Disney films of the 1940s and 50s had better animation.The linear, rambling storyline and lack of thinking required should make this ideal for kids, though the long duration of the movie and jumbled plot might be too much for their concentration spans.

","It is the mid-1960s. Elisa is mute, and a cleaner at a US government experiment facility. Her life is quite mundane and unfulfilled. Then the facility starts on a new project: the US government has captured a man-fish hybrid in South America and now they are seeing if the creature's unique physiology could have some uses for humans, especially for astronauts. Elisa becomes attached to the creature.The winner of Best Picture at the 2018 Oscars, though difficult to see why. A pretty basic movie - a linear romantic drama with one-dimensional characters, cartoonish, badness-laid-on-so-thick-it's-laughable villains, conventional plot development and a fairly predictable ending. It's not that profound or original in its themes or development (unless the viewer has only seen a handful of movies in their life) - quite dumbed-down (though that might be more a reflection of modern audiences than anything else). If it wasn't for the excellent CGI, the sentimentality, the slickness of the plot development and some of the performances it would be just another B-grade creature feature.Part of the problem is that director Guillermo del Toro tries to steer a path between fairy tale and gritty drama, and thus ends up with something that is tonally jarring and inconsistent. The movie from the start has a light, airy feel, the ideal set up for a sweet, all-ages drama. There's even some funny moments to help this along. Yet, interspersed with the lightness are several adult-orientated scenes. Even as the movie becomes darker, bloodier and grittier, del Toro still tries to cling to the fairy tale side.Made as a plain fairy tale-like drama, suitable for all ages, this would have worked a whole lot better.Not that it's that bad though. The movie moves at a decent pace and is quite entertaining. There is a decent level of intrigue and tension and Sally Hawkins puts in a great performance as Elisa.",6,4,7,12 May 2018

For a crime drama, it is not very gritty and is filled with Hollywood clichés.Reasonably interesting but could have been great. However, there are so many Hollywoodisms and glamourisations it feels quite superficial.The weak script and formulaic movie-for-the-masses directing by Brian De Palma are compounded by the usual unconvincing performance from Kevin Costner. He alternates between dead boring and overly gung ho here.Sean Connery is almost equally flat and unconvincing.In fact, there's hardly a convincing and/or engaging performance to be found here. The only good one comes from Robert De Niro who is charming and suitably mean and scary as Al Capone. Vastly overrated.",6,4,7,28 October 2014
The Godfather: Part III," Unnecessary and overwrought but reasonably interesting and entertaining
","It is 1979, about 22 years since the events of The Godfather II. For Michael Corleone, the move to legitimacy is complete: the New York crime business has been handed over to Joey Zasa and all elements of the Corleone business empire are legal, non-criminal enterprises. Michael, approaching 60, is now thinking about his legacy. His charity, run by his daughter Mary, has just handed over $100 million to the Catholic Church. Michael also intends buying a large stake in International Immobiliari, a Vatican-run property company. Things are peaceful and stable but then Vincent Mancini, Sonny Corleone's illegitimate son, starts a feud with Joey Zasa. This has far- reaching, deadly consequences, including for Michael's deal with the Vatican.Unnecessary, as The Godfather II didn't need a sequel. Francis Ford Coppola has stated that he only did it for the money. The product itself is a bit hit-and-miss. Plot has some intrigue, with a Robert Ludlum-like Vatican conspiracy woven into a more conventional mafia story. This does mean a departure from the feel of the first two movies, and I'm note sure it's a good departure. The plot becomes unnecessarily complex and overwrought, making it less tight than the first two movies. Coppola also unnecessarily draws out the movie - every scene gets stretched to the limit and there's a lot of padding. He could easily have lopped 40 minutes (at least) off the movie without us losing any information or engagement.Then there's the performances, which are mostly good, with two notable exceptions. The old guard - Al Pacino, Dianne Keaton, Talia Shire - put in solid performances. The change in Connie, from passive to assertive and decisive, was one of the positive features of this movie and Talia Shire is great in that role.The new faces include some pretty big names: Eli Wallach, Joe Mantegna, Andy Garcia, George Hamilton, John Savage, Bridget Fonda. Andy Garcia is great as Vincent Mancini, a worthy (potential) successor to Michael. Bridget Fonda is great but criminally underused, especially as it appeared that she would have a bigger role. Eli Wallach and Joe Mantegna are solid as Don Altobello and Joey Zasa, respectively, and John Savage has little screen time. George Hamilton is badly miscast as BJ Harrison, Michael's attorney. He really didn't fit the part and comes off as somewhat unconvincing. He was stepping into Robert Duvall's shoes - Tom Hagen was meant to continue into The Godfather III but the character was dropped when Robert Duvall pulled out over a pay dispute - so he does suffer due to the comparison with Duvall.Then we have the performance which almost single-handedly wrecks this movie: Sofia Coppola. She is absolutely atrocious as Mary Corleone, well deserving her 1991 Razzie wins for Worst Supporting Actress and Worst New Star. Her dialogue delivery is incredibly flat and unconvincing and even when she has no dialogue she seems awkward, like she doesn't know what to do with herself when she's on camera. Her flat delivery results in lack of engagement with her character, and this ruins the climax of the movie. So, there are greater consequences to her terrible performance.It's a good thing she took up directing - she's clearly better at that.Apparently she wasn't first choice for the part, as Julia Roberts and then Winona Ryder were cast for the role but then had to pull out. So at least Francis Ford Coppola could say she was hired more out of desperation than being his daughter. Still, he really should have kept looking... (Aside: Winona Ryder as Mary - how awesome would that have been? The mind boggles. And yes, I am a big Winona Ryder fan.)Overall: not bad, but not that good either.",6,3,5,29 May 2016
The Matrix Reloaded," Dull and pointless
","Not a fan of the first movie, and this is even worse. The whole plot just seems like an excuse for several well-choreographed but dull fight scenes in slow motion, complete with impossible moves and such. Quite dull and pointless.",4,1,4,18 March 2018
The Disaster Artist," Surprisingly brilliant - screamingly funny
","San Francisco, 1998. Aspiring actor Greg Sestero meets Tommy Wiseau in an acting class. Wiseau is off-the-scale weird and hopelessly untalented as an actor but has a stupendous amount of self-confidence. Sestero and Wiseau form a friendship and move to Los Angeles to pursue their dream of making it big in Hollywood. After landing no roles, they decide to make their own movie. Produced, directed and written by Wiseau and with him in the lead role, the resulting movie is regarded as one of the worst movies ever made, if not THE worst - The Room.I had very low expectations for this movie. I have seen The Room and it is truly terrible. For me it is the worst movie ever made (and I've seen heaps of terrible movies). So the idea of making (what seemed like) an homage to such a useless piece of excrement didn't appeal to me. Furthermore, The Disaster Artist is directed by, produced by and stars James Franco, someone whom I view as being one of the most overrated people in the film industry. To my surprise, not only is this good, it's brilliant. More a parody than a homage, the movie is screamingly funny. I say 'parody', implying Franco went out to make fun of Wiseau and The Room, but in fact what's shown in the movie is pretty much what actually happened in the making of The Room. The screenplay is based on Greg Sestero's book on the making of The Room and Tommy Wiseau said after seeing this movie that it was 99.9% accurate.James Franco does a superb job as Tommy Wiseau, capturing his accent and mannerisms perfectly. He seemed to be really having fun with the character, without mocking Wiseau. Surprised he didn't get an Oscar nomination for his efforts (though it was largely a comedic effort, and comedy performances don't tend to get Oscar nominations).Dave Franco, James's brother, plays Greg Sestero and also does a great job.Supporting cast are a who's-who of Hollywood: Seth Rogen (he had to be in there somewhere - this is a James Franco movie!), Alison Brie (Dave Franco's real-life wife), Jacki Weaver, Paul Scheer, Zac Efron, Josh Hutcherson, Megan Mullally, Sharon Stone, Melanie Griffith, Bob Odenkirk. Tommy Wiseau even has a minor role - keep watching until after the credits.James Franco pulls it all together with a deftness that is great to behold. Every time there was a serious moment I worried that the movie would degenerate into empty sentimentality but these dramatic moments are handled sensitively, and with a sense of profundity, without overdoing the sappiness. I even came away with a degree of admiration for Wiseau, something I would not have thought possible.I have a new-found respect for James Franco, as actor and director and for his sense of film history.",9,1,2,1 October 2018
Zombieland," Not your average zombie movie...
","Hilariously funny zombie-comedy-drama.Plot is fairly random, but it doesn't really matter. In fact, the rambling nature of the story just adds to the charm. No, the best thing about the movie is the one-liners, and their delivery. The comedic plot devices, eg Columbus' rules for dealing with zombies, are also great. Woody Harrelson is the known name in the cast, and delivers in spades as the hard-bitten tough guy. However, it is Jesse Eisenberg who steals the show as the dead-panning nerd. (I saw The Social Network before Zombieland, otherwise I would never of heard of him before). Good support from Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin, and a great cameo from Bill Murray.Certainly not your average zombie movie, and not merely a zombie-parody either. Much more than both of those. Definitely worth watching.",8,0,2,20 March 2014

Just when he seems to have everything going for him - a beautiful, loving wife and a successful academic career - he is diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. The lines between reality and his imagination, driven by his powerful mind, become blurred...Powerful, emotional drama, largely based on a true story. The way Nash is able to overcome his disability and become one of the foremost minds in the field of economics is amazing, and a sight to see.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," OK, but not great
","The first Harry Potter was interesting, and good fun. Much of this was due to the novelty of it all. The first Harry Potter introduced us to the characters and concepts of the series.This, the second, uses that template and provides another plot. The plot is fairly mundane and overwrought. At nearly three hours it is ridiculously long for a linear plot-driven kid's adventure story.This is all said, there is a momentum that keeps it going. There are some new concepts and characters. All this is enough to make it marginally likable (hence the 3/5).High points for me are the acting of Kenneth Branagh and Alan Rickman, and their characters' rivalry.The worry is that if the Harry Potter series has run out of steam this much since the first movie, what will the eighth movie be like?",6,0,1,26 January 2014

Quite funny and intriguing. From a point, however, it just degenerates into a common-or-garden action movie. Is mostly silly, one-dimensional and predictable after that.Performances are fine though. This is the movie where the Pitt- Jolie romance started and the chemistry between them is tangible.Good support from Vince Vaughn. I'm generally not a fan of his movies but here he does good work, providing some of the funnier moments. Maybe he should just avoid lead roles...",5,1,3,15 February 2016
The Departed," Brilliant: intense, clever and action-filled
","A tale of two cops, though on different sides of the law. Colin Sullivan (played by Matt Damon) is a Massachusetts State police detective. He has risen through the ranks to head up a special department. Public Enemy Number 1 is Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), a crime network kingpin, and the Sullivan's main target. However, Sullivan is a paid informant for Costello, giving him tip- offs on police raids and other useful information. Meanwhile, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) works for Costello. However, he is actually an undercover policeman, spying on Costello. In due course, both know that there is a rat in their organisation, but don't know their identity. A deadly cat-and-mouse game ensues, with both trying to uncover the other without being discovered themselves.Brilliant crime-drama from master director Martin Scorsese. Slick, clever, watertight plot. The symmetry and interdependence of the two adversaries makes for a very intriguing story and nail-biting situations. Often they have a piece of the puzzle but to get the complete picture and identify the mole they have to break their own cover, creating some very tense situations.Some great character-based drama too, especially involving Costigan. The love triangle involving Madolyn (Vera Farmiga) was a nice touch.The Departed is an adaptation of the Hong Kong crime-drama Infernal Affairs. Similar plots but The Departed has deeper characters, more interesting sub-plots and wittier dialogue. For these reasons I rate The Departed higher than Infernal Affairs.Historic movie too in that it gave Scorsese his first Oscar, at last. After six nominations previously with no award, he won Best Director for The Departed. When you look at what he was previously nominated for - Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Gangs of New York, The Aviator, among others - and consider those he should have been nominated for - Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy - then you have to consider him incredibly unlucky. That, or the Academy doesn't like him.On the subject of people the Academy doesn't like, Leanardo DiCaprio puts in a great performance as Costigan. His was the more difficult of the two lead roles, as Costigan was a much more complex character than Sullivan. Matt Damon hardly had to stretch himself for his role. Sadly, though not unsurprisingly considering DiCaprio's history with the Oscars, DiCaprio didn't even get an Oscar nomination for his efforts.Mark Wahlberg did get a nomination, as Best Supporting Actor. He puts in a good performance as the over-the-top, obnoxious, no- nonsense Staff Sergeant Dignam. It's debatable whether the nomination was deserved. The performance does stand out, however, due to the colourfulness of the character.Remaining cast is pretty much an all-star one and includes Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Vera Farmiga and Ray Winstone. All of them deliver in spades, as do the minor players.A 21st century classic.",10,0,2,2 July 2016

Solid enough plot, though, as I mentioned, drifts towards the end. Direction is good, with the prerequisite number of explosions and blood for an action movie.Acting-wise, this is the movie that made Bruce Willis' career. Cool, mean, bad-guy-killing, wise-cracking, he does everything required of an action leading actor. Alan Rickman does what he does best - the evil- personified bad guy.

Psycho," Masterpiece
","A masterpiece. The ultimate thriller, and the movie that created the template for slasher-horror movies. Solid plot, but the genius behind this is Alfred Hitchcock's direction. Hitchcock builds the tension and constantly keeps you on your toes. His use of camera angles is superb. This, all while keeping the movie moving along at a brisk pace. At no stage does it drift, or get bogged down.Hitchcock is aided by some excellent performances. Anthony Perkins is calculating menace personified as Norman Bates. Janet Leigh shines and deserved her Oscar nomination.Truly a classic, and one of the greatest movies of all time.",10,3,4,19 April 2014
American Made," Entertaining
","1978. Barry Seal, an airline pilot, is recruited by the CIA to fly special transport missions in Central America. Initially it is a matter of information-for-supplies but ultimately he ends up being a drug transporter for Pablo Escobar and the Medellin Cartel and supplying anti-Communist groups, including the Nicaraguan Contras, with weapons.Entertaining. Told in a very light-hearted, fun way it is a roller-coaster ride of humour and action. The humour stems largely from the ineptness and unintended consequences of the actions of the CIA and US government. If told in a more serious way, this would have been a very damning indictment of the US's involvement in Central America in the 1980s, and a powerful examination of how the CIA and US government abuse the loyalty of their own citizens. However, the story is told as a comedy, with absurdity piled upon absurdity, so difficult to believe. Just as well, as, in actual fact, much of what is described is fictional. In particular, the real Barry Seal was hardly a paragon of virtue and only ended up working with the US Government once he was facing jail time.Still, an entertaining story, regardless of its accuracy.",7,0,1,10 June 2018
Rosemary's Baby," Classic horror
","A classic horror movie. Those are words you don't hear often, because horror movies are generally dime-a-dozen formulaic crap. However, with Rosemary's Baby Roman Polanski crafts a slow-burning, horror-as- undercurrent, drama that defines how horror movies should be made.Polanski's script is subtle and his direction even more clever. The movie starts slowly, and very innocuously, but you can sense the gathering momentum and evil. The final scene brings everything together, and justifies the 'horror' tag.Great performance by Mia Farrow in the lead role. John Cassavetes gives good support as Rosemary's husband. Ruth Gordon almost steals the show as the elderly, seemingly-innocent, neighbour. She well deserved her Best Supporting Actress Oscar.",8,0,0,27 August 2014
Jersey Boys," Good but not great - lacked something to make it special
","Good but not great - lacked something to make it special.A Clint Eastwood-directed drama which covers the history of Franki Valli and the Four Seasons. Interesting from a music history point of view. Many of their most well-known hits are also performed, making it even more entertaining.However, there was no spark to make to truly special. While the band members' history and friendship is covered, there is still not that much engagement with the characters. Eastwood just scratches the surface of the relationship between the band members and of their individual characters.Plus, the movie isn't entirely accurate and does take some poetic licence for dramatic purposes.Decent performance by John Lloyd Young as Franki Valli. Standout performance, however, goes to Vincent Piazza as Tommy DeVito. Good work by Christopher Walken in a supporting role. Worth a watch purely from a musical history perspective, and pretty much that only, unfortunately.",7,1,2,7 June 2015

Despite the high emotional content, the movie glides along effortlessly.Well written. Good plot and the dialogue is intelligently funny and couldn't be more snappy. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan were perfectly cast as Harry and Sally. The chemistry between them was spot-on and contributes enormously to the watchability of the movie. I'm generally not a fan of Meg Ryan, as she tends to act in vapid romantic dramas, but she is great here. Billy Crystal is very well known in comedy circles, but here he gets to shine in a more serious role.",10,1,2,19 April 2014

Excellent direction from Bigelow - the tension is built, and even though you know how it ends, it stays incredibly engrossing throughout. You hardly realise that the movie is over 2 1/2 hours long, the high level of engagement is so constant and the pace of the movie so perfect. Great performance from Jessica Chastain in the lead role. Good support from Jason Clarke, Kyle Chandler, Mark Strong and Jennifer Ehle. Minor parts for Joel Edgerton and James Gandolfini.",10,24,45,19 April 2014
Steve Jobs," Interesting, engaging and emotional
","The career and personal life of Apple founder Steve Jobs, told through three important product launch presentations from 1984, 88 and 98. We see how he got there, the ingenuity behind the products, what makes Jobs tick, the personal issues he was facing at the time and how he dealt with them.This could easily have turned into a dry, linear biopic. The first Steve Jobs movie, Jobs (2013), was just that. Edifying but not overly interesting and quite unengaging. Certainly not helped by having a B-grade comedy actor (Ashton Kutcher) in the lead role.However, this Steve Jobs movie is far from dry. It is highly engaging, through showing us the man behind the brand, warts and all. Michael Fassbender does a superb job in the lead role, mixing cold business acumen with vulnerability, empathy and warmth.A very dialogue-filled movie, feeling much like a play, and this helps. The dialogue drives the plot and the character depth, and provides some good humour too.On the negative side, the relationship and issues with his daughter feel a bit overwrought and overstated at times, but this is not a major issue.In addition to Fassbender's superb performance, an excellent supporting performance too from Kate Winslet as Joanna Hoffman. Both Fassbender and Winslet received Oscar nominations. Good support too from Jeff Daniels, Michael Stuhlbarg and, very surprisingly, Seth Rogen. Rogen, more at home delivering comedy performances, is excellent here in a dramatic role, playing Steve Wozniak.",8,1,1,22 December 2016
Crazy Heart," Beautifully mellow and sensitive
","Good drama. Plot is decent, but not perfect. Direction is good, but the movie does drift at times. However, the movie is made by the acting of Jeff Bridges, the general feel of the movie and the great soundtrack.Jeff Bridges' Best Actor Oscar was well deserved, and came after four previous nominations (and several performances which should have been nominated, eg The Big Lebowski, The Fisher King) without an award.The supporting cast - Maggie Gyllenhaal (especially), Robert Duvall, Colin Farrell - also give good performances.The movie has a beautiful mellowness and sensitivity to it.I am not a fan of country music, but the soundtrack is superb. Featuring original music mostly written by T-Bone Burnett and Stephen Bruton, and being more rock than country, it helps the movie along, and is excellent in its own right. Amazingly, Jeff Bridges and Colin Farrell sang their own songs - there were no overdubs - and sounded like the real thing. Colin Farrell is particularly impressive.Overall, not a perfect movie, but a great one nevertheless.",8,1,1,8 March 2015

With romantic notions of war and idealistic dreams in his head he undergoes training and then is sent off to the Western Front. In due course the romantic notions are replaced by the harsh reality of war and he becomes disillusioned with it all.Great World War 1 movie, made when the war was still fresh in everyone's minds. Might well be the first anti-war war movie, as it depicts the grim realities of war, rather than the romantic, heroic non-existent version of it. Harrowing, shocking, original, unpredictable, and just as relevant today as in 1930.Surprisingly good production values for 1930. Solid performances all round.

The movie shows them falling in love, and, in some cases, falling out of love.Unoriginal, superficial, predictable and cheesy. Every romantic-drama cliché is on display, and repeated several times. Even worse, the whole romantic angle seems so superficial, like the movie should be called an infatuation-drama, not a romantic-drama.The only interesting story was the one involving a divorce.

More than the story of Solomon Northup, the movie illuminates slavery and the divide in the US at the time.Superb performances all round, particularly by Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northup and Michael Fassbender as Edwin Epps, the volatile plantation owner.

Isla Fisher is fantastically over-the-top and scary as the clingy Gloria. Rachel McAdams is wonderful as Claire. Bradley Cooper plays the bad guy for once, and does it extremely well - swarmy, in-your-face and very over-the-top. Christopher Walken is...Christopher Walken.

The fact that it stars Cher and Christina Aguilera is an indication that this is going to be nothing nearly as good as any of those films I mentioned. The fact that they both get to sing, and Aguilera gets to sing a lot, confirms your worst suspicions.Plot is basic. The whole movie seems like one long Christina Aguilera music video. Accordingly, the music is also pretty bad.Acting is unconvincing. This really has nothing going for it.Avoid.",3,3,10,11 August 2019
Joker," Great drama, with a stand-out performance from Joaquin Phoenix
","Gotham City. Arthur Fleck works as a clown and is also an aspiring stand-up comic. He has mental health issues, part of which involves uncontrollable laughter. Times are tough and, due to his issues and occupation, Arthur has an even worse time than most. Over time these issues bear down on him, shaping his actions, making him ultimately take on the persona he is more known as...Joker.Great drama. While the movie fits into the Batman universe, and this could easily be seen as a prequel to Joker's character in The Dark Knight (where Joker was played superbly by Heath Ledger), this is not a comic-book movie. If it was a comic-book movie, it would have ended up another one in a long, seemingly endless line of them, one hardly discernible from the next.No, this is a human/psychological drama, and a very good one. Writer-director Todd Phillips creates a dark, depressing world with Arthur Fleck one of its primary casualties. The slow, inevitable progress of Arthur Fleck from innocent man to master-criminal is an interesting journey as Phillips rachets up the tension.What was then required was a performance that captured that darkness, helplessness and gradual disintegration and Joaquin Phoenix gives that, perfectly and spectacularly. Spot-on casting and delivery.Not quite the perfect movie though. Pacing was a bit off: some scenes seem dragged out too long. I know Phillips was drawing it out to create tension and atmosphere, but on a few occasions it feels like he overdoes it.It is also difficult, from a point, to be sympathetic towards Arthur Fleck. You start out supporting him, feeling that he is a victim rather than a villain, but, as his actions become more extreme, that engagement wanes.The story also feels like it is missing something to make it 100% complete. No, I'm not expecting this to link in with The Dark Knight. In fact, many of the Batman references actually seemed unnecessary, more there for audiences to gasp and say 'Oh, so that's how Joker fits in with Batman', rather than adding anything to this story. A few scenes beyond the final scene might have been in order, to see more of Joker's history.Overall, still a great movie though.",8,24,52,4 October 2019
To Kill a Mockingbird," Powerful, moving story of injustice, prejudice, family and growing up
","Small-town Alabama, 1932. Atticus Finch (played by Gregory Peck) is a lawyer and a widower. He has two young children, Jem and Scout. Atticus Finch is currently defending Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman. Meanwhile, Jem and Scout are intrigued by their neighbours, the Radleys, and the mysterious, seldom-seen Boo Radley in particular.Based on the Harper Lee novel, a powerful, moving story of injustice, prejudice, family and growing up. The examination of 'justice' based on racial lines is particularly profound and relevant to its time. The racism that forms the background to the trial is also incredibly gut-wrenching.Just the justice/injustice/racism angle alone was enough to make this movie great. The court scenes, and Finch's closing argument, are among the most powerful ever committed to film. However, tipping the movie over into the masterpiece category are the scenes involving the children.Showing Atticus Funch's family life creates a great sense of engagement with the characters and the town in particular. The children bring a wonderful sense of innocence, boundless vitality and the wonder of discovery and growing up to the movie, and provide some great comedic moments. They also bring some great drama, especially towards the end.Gregory Peck deservedly won a Best Actor Oscar for his stirring, emotional portrayal of Atticus Finch. Incidentally, this was his first and only win, on his fifth and final nomination.Mary Badham, at 9/10 years old, did a great job of playing the hyper-energetic, tomboyish Scout and got a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for her efforts. At the time she was the youngest ever nominee in the Best Supporting Actress category.Good support from a great cast, none of whom put a foot wrong. Robert Duvall made his feature film debut in this movie and, although he has no lines and little screen time, his performance, especially his opening shot, is very memorable and powerful.",10,0,1,21 May 2016
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Vastly overrated
","A vastly overrated movie.Starts off well, showing how British prisoners-of-war are treated by the Japanese, especially their harrowing forced labour. Is quite gritty, especially for its time. From this it develops into a battle of wills between the British and Japanese commanders. Then its a movie about pride and morale.The William Holden side-plot was interesting, and provided some light relief.Ultimately, however, it's a movie about stupidity, treason and collusion with the enemy... And the man who commits all these acts is treated as a hero.For me the movie was fine for about 70-80% of its duration, but then totally fell apart at the end. The last few scenes are ridiculous: how anyone can act like that - sabotage a mission, get allied soldiers killed - and then be treated as a hero, is beyond me.I've now watched this movie at least four times, all at different stages of my life. From the second time onwards I have been expecting to get a different insight, being older and having a more evolved knowledge of the world, but I keep coming to the same conclusion.",5,4,8,14 November 2014
A Hard Day's Night," Silly at times, but the music more than makes up for this
","Silly at times, but the music more than makes up for this.Ostensibly 'a day in the life of the Beatles' A Hard Day's Night is fairly entertaining. Snappy one-liners, some of which are legendary, and general hijinks, plus a Beatles concert. The plot, what there is, is fairly basic and sometimes tries too hard to be witty or cool and just comes across as silly. This said, the silliness fits in well with the general vibe of the movie and is never excessive.Moreover, the music is great, as you would expect - this is the Beatles, remember!",7,1,2,13 October 2014
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Great, original movie
","Felon Randle McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) gets sentenced to a term at a mental asylum. He is not really insane but pleaded insane to avoid a harsher sentence. Once inside he discovers that it is no picnic, with the patients being ruled with an iron fist by oppressive head nurse Nurse Ratched. The naturally free-spirited, rebellious and extroverted McMurphy livens up the place, making confrontation with Ratched inevitable.Great, original movie. Decent dramatic plot with some great humorous detours. Maybe a bit too linear and basic to make it brilliant, but very entertaining nevertheless.Won the 1976 Best Picture Oscar. Also won Best Director (for Milos Forman), Best Leading Actor (Jack Nicholson), Best Leading Actress (Louise Fletcher) and Adapted Screenplay (Lawrence Hauben & Bo Goldman), making it the first movie since It Happened One Night in 1934 to win all 5 major awards at the Oscars.",8,1,3,31 January 2017
Edge of Tomorrow," Groundhog Day meets Starship Troopers
","Groundhog Day meets Starship Troopers...with a hint of Philip K Dick thrown in.A soldier fighting aliens gets to relive the same day over and over again, the day restarting every time he dies. Intrigue commences. A fairly clever sci fi/action drama, which is rare nowadays. Plot is very complex but is for the most part reasonably watertight. There are a few minor gaps and implausibilities, but it mostly works. Plus the writers and director know when to quit with the clever stuff, and don't just start throwing clever twists and additional layers of complexity in just for the sake of showing off.Good special effects.Solid performances by Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt. While Cruise clearly is the main star, Blunt doesn't take a back seat and is as vital to the movie as Cruise. Decent supporting cast too.",8,0,1,11 May 2015
Whiplash," Enthralling story
","An enthralling story, set against the backdrop of a prestigious music school. It covers one young man's attempts to reach the top of the musical industry, and the band leader who may be his ticket, or his nemesis.A deeply psychological drama, it explores issues like ambition, obsession and power.Has a few interesting twists too, especially towards the end.Not perfect: some of the twists aren't consistent, character-wise. The final scene overplays the conclusion and is too neat in some ways. Despite this, it missed having a final word on one or two of the themes, leaving these as secondary considerations in favour of a more Hollywoodesque ending.Decent performance by Miles Teller in the lead role. Superb performance by JK Simmons as Fletcher, the band leader. He well deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for a performance that is searingly intense and perfect for the character.",8,1,3,14 March 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Great exposition of the excesses of Wall Street
","Great exposition of the excesses of Wall Street. A warts-and-all examination of how greed corrupts and drives people, and of the more hedonistic side of human nature. Superb story-telling by Martin Scorsese, aided by Terrance Winter's (of Sopranos and Boardwalk Empire fame) excellent screenplay and Jordan Belfort's own book. Yes, it is three hours long, but it doesn't feel like it. It is that engrossing and fast-paced. The only time I did feel it was a tad too long was near the end, as some of the run-ins with the law and legal wranglings seemed like padding.Hilariously funny at times, while still preserving a biopic's sense of drama. In some ways, this is a minor problem, as you veer from screamingly funny scenes to dead-serious scenes, and you keep waiting for a punchline.Excellent performances all round. Will be interesting to see if Leonardo Di Caprio finally gets an Oscar, as the Academy seem determined to never give him one...Jonah Hill almost steals the show though. Well deserves his Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. His transformation into a dramatic actor is complete.Good support from a host of stars, not all of which have prominent roles: Rob Reiner, Matthew McConaughey, Jean Dujardin, Kyle Chandler, Joanna Lumley, John Favreau, Shea Wigham. Excellent performance by the stunningly beautiful Australian actress Margot Robbie as Belfort's second wife.",9,0,2,27 January 2014
Army of Darkness," Quite silly but has its moments
","Quite silly but has its moments.A man in modern times, Ash (played by Bruce Campbell), is attacked by an evil force and transported back in time, to the Dark Ages. He is soon captured by the local king but eventually wins the locals over. The local wise man figures that Ash is The Chosen One, a special person sent to free the land from evil forces. To do so he must track down a special book, the Necronomicon, and recite a certain phrase. However, things don't go exactly to plan...This started well. The jokes flowed thick and fast and Bruce Campbell was great with the one-liners. The plot was never going to be too serious but it wasn't too bad to start off with, and the humour carried the movie.Then, from a point, it just got stupidly silly, and the jokes become less frequent. It stopped being a comedy and become a common-or- garden zombie / living dead movie. There were still a few good incidences and laugh-out-loud moments, but these were negated by the silliness of the plot.Overall, more silly than funny, but not to a huge extent.",5,0,2,9 January 2016
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Reasonably good
","Reasonably good. A return to form after the massive disappointment that was Die Hard 2. Still fairly unoriginal and one-dimensional, but not as predictable as Die Hard 2, with better action sequences and special effects.Bruce Willis is his usual action-hero self in the lead role. Samuel L Jackson, fresh from his success in Pulp Fiction, does a good job as the sidekick. Jeremy Irons, better known as a dramatic actor, does a decent job as the evil villain, complete with compulsory German accent.Die Hard 4.0 was just as good, but #5, A Good Day to Die Hard, was very poor.",6,1,4,26 January 2014
"Hail, Caesar!"," Not among the Coen Brothers' best but still quite entertaining
","Hollywood, 1950s. Eddie Mannix is Head of Physical Production at Capitol Studios. His life is one of non-stop action: casting issues, production issues, keeping the studios stars in line, ensuring the studio avoids negative publicity, dealing with the press, playing matchmaker to the studios stars, among other things. His current main issue is that one of the studios biggest stars, Baird Whitlock, has been kidnapped by Communist screenwriters. But its all in a day's work for Eddie Mannix.Quite entertaining...in spells. It's really quite hit-and-miss. The first 30-40 minutes or so, which were mostly background, were great. There was a wonderful sense of lightness and quirkiness about the movie. However, the plot development wasn't always engaging and was sometimes silly or dull. Worst of all was the main plot, the kidnapping of Baird Whitlock. It seemed implausible and silly from a point and never really got back on track.On the positive side, the Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) - Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes) sub-plot was great: funny, and the casting issues around it seemed quite realistic. Some great moments in other sub-plots too.At an overall level, what keeps the movie from falling apart is the boundless, infectious energy of Eddie Mannix. Josh Brolin is superb in the role.The other glue is the Coen Brothers obvious love of cinema and the art of movie making. This movie is a homage to the Hollywood of the 50s and the Coen Brothers spare no effort in recapturing that era. Good ending which ties the whole story together well. The takeaway message from the movie may be self-serving but it is loving and sincere.",7,1,2,16 July 2016
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Hilariously funny and wonderfully unPC
","San Diego, 1970s. Ron Burgundy is an anchorman at a local TV news station. He is very popular and a local celebrity. His news segment is Number 1 across all demographics and things are going incredibly well. However, his news team is entirely male and resembles a boys club. In the interests of diversity the station brings in a female reporter, Veronica Corningstone. While the remainder of the team are appalled at the decision, Ron is torn between a similar misogynism and his attraction to her. Initially Ron and Veronica do well, and an intimate relationship forms. However, an event splits them apart, resulting in a bitter feud between the two.Hilariously funny, often in a clever and/or over-the-top sort of way. Some fantastic lines and scenes, many of which have the entered the one-liner lexicon and/or meme hall of fame. Wonderfully politically incorrect, and sure to offend the types who choose to find things to be offended by. Joke's on them: these jokes and stereotypes are satirical...Will Ferrell and Christina Applegate are great in the lead roles. Well supported by Paul Rudd, Steve Carell and David Koechner. Favourite performance, for me, is from Fred Willard as Ed Harken. Faultless, understated delivery.The lesser supporting roles contain some amazing names, some of whom weren't stars at the time: Chris Parnell, Vince Vaughan, Fred Armisen, Seth Rogen, Danny Trejo, Tim Robbins, Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Luke Wilson.A modern comedy classic.",8,1,2,25 March 2017
American Gangster," Excellent crime-drama
","Excellent crime-drama.The story of Frank Lucas, the man who built a massive drug empire largely from scratch, and Richie Roberts, the outcast cop who took him down. Shows Lucas' rise to power, through ingenuity, business sense and plain ruthlessness and how he managed to fly under the police's (and many other people's) radar for so long. Also shows how the cops eventually pinpointed him as the drug kingpin they were after, their investigations and how they eventually got him.Great storytelling from director Ridley Scott. He builds the details, and shows the history of the two protagonists, in parallel for a while. Then he builds the tension as everything comes together. In the end you have a great no-pretence, gritty, almost old-fashioned film noir gangster movie.Great work by Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe in the lead roles. Good supporting cast too.On the negative side, there are a few sub-plots and scenes which seem unnecessary (eg the Cuba Gooding angle). In addition, there are some turns of events that seem implausible, especially towards the end (eg Roberts as both cop and prosecutor). This doesn't take too much away from quality of the movie though.",9,2,3,23 December 2015
The Reader," Original, intriguing, thought-provoking and moving
","In 1995, a German man reminisces about a relationship he had, as a teenager, in 1958 with an older woman. He also remembers what happened subsequent to that, including her standing trial for war crimes committed during World War 2, and the secret which denied her justice...Excellent movie. Searingly emotional with an original, intriguing and thought-provoking plot. Direction is spot-on. Pacing is perfect.Kate Winslet is mind-bogglingly brilliant in the lead role and well deserved her Best Leading Actress Oscar. Ralph Fiennes puts in his usual solid performance. The revelation though is David Kross, who brings a maturity beyond his years.A must-see movie, and an instant classic.",10,0,0,20 December 2015
The Wrestler," Amazing movie
","An aging professional wrestler, Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (played by Mickey Rourke) is well past his prime as a wrestler but clings to memories of his heyday. He also still believes he has what to takes to continue wrestling. Meanwhile his relationship with his daughter is very cold. Then he has a health scare...Amazing. One of the most moving movies I have ever seen. Right up there with movies like Million Dollar Baby and Lost In Translation in terms of emotional content and character exploration.Mickey Rourke deserves all the accolades for his acting performance - he is superb - but Marisa Tomei is excellent too, as is Evan Rachel Wood. Darren Aronofsky's direction is spot-on and the story is incredible.",10,1,1,20 December 2015
Dark Shadows," Not that good, but not bad either
","Interesting, and sometimes quite amusing, yet not compelling. Broad plot is reasonably original, but once the scene is set, what follows is mediocre.

Kingpin," Don't be put off - it gets a lot better
","I almost stopped watching this movie. The first 40 minutes or so are incredibly bad. Unfunny, gross-out toilet attempts at humour and silly, pointless plot.But then, from a point, it gets better. The jokes become cleverer and funnier. There is suddenly a depth to the characters and there is even a semblance of a plot.This all culminates in some great bowling scenes, with Bill Murray at his entertaining best.On that note, Bill Murray, while only being a supporting performer, is great in this movie and almost steals the show. Woody Harrelson and Randy Quaid give solid performances and Vanessa Angel adds the eye candy, but Murray takes the movie to another level. Another thing that keeps the movie going is the soundtrack. Great music, especially the outro by Blues Traveler.",6,0,3,2 October 2014
Hancock," Not great, but fairly entertaining
","John Hancock is a superhero. A superhero who's also an alcoholic and let himself go somewhat. He's now quite unpopular as his issues have lead to him destroying millions of dollars of property. Then a PR man decides to help him rebuild his image...Entertaining, and original in that this superhero is quite flawed. Quite funny at times too (it has Jason Bateman in it, remember).First half was good, and moved along at a brisk pace. Writer and director tried to be too clever and emotional in the latter half of the movie, resulting in the fizz disappearing.Not great, but worth a watch.",6,0,1,30 November 2017
12 Strong," Weak
","After the tragic events of 9/11, the US determines that the Taliban in Afghanistan is the source of many of the attacks on US citizens and assets. Their first step in confronting the Taliban is to send in Special Forces teams to link up with the Northern Alliance, the enemies of the Taliban, help them in their fight against Taliban, including through coordinating air support, and reduce the Taliban's territory. The first team 'in country' is Operational Detachment Alpha 595, lead by Captain Mitch Nelson. The 12 of them face overwhelming odds. This is their story.War movies generally fall into one of two buckets. First is the engaging, plot-and-character based, realistic, gritty type, e.g. Saving Private Ryan, Platoon. Second is the superficial, gung ho, all-action and nothing else type, e.g. this movie.Quite weak, formulaic and lacking in substance. From the outset the clichés start to flow and they never let up. The attempts at engagement are so badly done - the trite family life scenes, the clumsy attempts to create some sense of camaraderie - that you already know the director isn't much good and this isn't going to go well. Anything that's not a battle scene is generally eye-rollingly bad.The battle scenes, however, are quite well done and prevent this movie from being a total waste of time. A bit over-the-top at times but still interesting viewing.Overall, give it a miss. This is not to detract from the bravery and achievements of the actual ODA 595, whose feats are worth capturing in a film. Just not this film. They deserve better.",4,9,18,14 December 2018
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Deterred by the dullness of the first one
","Saw the first one, and that was enough. Plus, the Lord of the Rings trilogy should have prepared me for this: stunning visual effects but not much else. Long rambling linear story, filled with nick-of-time savings from death by randomly introduced forces. Plus, goes on forever, and you have to get through three of these before you get a conclusion (screw that!). Yep, pretty much Lord of the Rings all over again.At 9 hours or so in total, this series of movies will go down in history as the first time ever a book was quicker to read than the adapted movie was to watch...However, kids will love it (though the movie's length may hinder that), as will nerds.",4,1,4,26 January 2016
Ray," Great biopic on a music legend
","The story of Ray Charles, music legend. Told in his adult live with flashbacks to his youth we see his humble origins in Florida, his turbulent childhood which included losing his brother and then his sight, his rise as pianist in a touring band, his writing his own songs and running his own band and then stardom. We also see his addiction to drugs and its affect on his working life and family life.Great biopic. Tells the Ray Charles story well and demonstrates his influence on musical history. Also shows his demons and how he overcame them.Quite emotional too: we see how, once he had lost his sight, his mother forced him to be self-reliant and how this paid off for him in later life.Superb performance by Jamie Foxx in the lead role. The movie could easily have been a standard blow-by-blow account of the Ray Charles story but Foxx inhabits his character and captures his mannerisms and personality very well. Even more impressive in that he is a sighted man, playing a blind man. Foxx deserved his Best Actor Oscar.",9,1,2,20 June 2016
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Wonderful animation classic
","Wonderful animation classic.A Disney movie, based on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale. A young princess, Snow White, is despised by her jealous Queen. The Queen arranges for a huntsman to kill Snow White in the forest, but he is unable to do it. Snow White escapes into the forest, stumbling across a house occupied by what appears to be seven children...Revolutionary for its time, and still brilliant today, Snow White is an absolute classic, not just among animated movies or Disney movies, but among movies full stop. Sweet story, excellent animation that still looks fantastic today and some great songs, many of which are instantly recognisable even if you haven't seen the movie before.Ideal for all ages too - not just a children's movie.",9,3,3,5 January 2016
The Lion King," Cheesy and predictable, but has its moments
","Cheesy and predictable movie, but has its moments. Pretty standard plot, which, but for a few minor detours, can be foreseen from start to finish. Some of the detours are quite interesting though.The humour is mostly quite child-orientated and lame, but there are a few good lines.While most stuff is dumbed-down for kids, there are some decent edgier scenes. Most of Scar's scenes were worth watching. Basically the story was so syrupy-sweet, you got to support the bad guy (even the plot is so predictable you know it won't end well for him).Making it a semi-musical didn't help either. I dislike musicals intensely (though there are a few exceptions): all the music serves is to pad out the movie.Star-studded cast for the voices: Matthew Broderick, James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Nathan Lane, Rowan Atkinson, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin. Pick of the bunch was Jeremy Irons as Scar - suitably evil voice, with gravitas.A kid's movie, and nothing more.",5,2,7,28 April 2014
Inception," Superb - clever and original
","Superb. Christopher Nolan, the genius who brought us the mind-blowingly brilliant Memento, comes up with something equally clever and original.Very intelligent plot, great direction, excellent CGI. All star cast - Leonardo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Ellen Page, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cotillard - delivers in spades.Why not 5/5? Maybe tries to be a bit too clever, as it does get a bit too convoluted. Also, can seem a bit clumsy and contrived in its implementation. Memento didn't overdo the cleverness, and was perfect in its delivery. In fact, of Nolan's movies, I would also put Following ahead of Inception. This is better than The Dark Knight, The Prestige, Batman Begins and Insomnia, though those were all good movies.",9,0,2,6 March 2014
Murder on the Orient Express," Dull and unnecessary - watch the 1974 version instead
","Famed Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is travelling on the Orient Express when a murder is committed. The victim was a particularly obnoxious man with a criminal past. As clues are revealed it is apparent that many of the other passengers on the train had a motive to kill him, making Poirot's task of identifying the murderer much more difficult.Dull and unnecessary. The 1974 version of Murder On the Orient Express, directed by Sidney Lumet, was superb. A great mixture of intrigue, atmosphere and 1930s quaintness combined with great performances from an all-star cast (Albert Finney, Sean Connery, Ingrid Bergman, Lauren Bacall, Jacqueline Bisset, Martin Balsam, John Gielgud, Anthony Perkins, Vanessa Redgrave, Richard Widmark and Michael York). Finney was perfect as Poirot.In this version, director Kenneth Branagh somehow manages to make an Agatha Christie mystery dull. It just feels like a straightforward, paint-by-numbers adaptation of the book. Intrigue is minimal, and is often replaced by action (presumably to appeal to modern audiences). Maybe it is because I already knew the solution to the mystery, but the whole thing felt so flat.Once again we have an all-star cast - Branagh, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, Daisy Ridley, Penelope Cruz, Derek Jacobi, Willem Dafoe - yet this time the performances feel subdued and uninspired. Branagh, for all his acting talent, is clearly not in the same league as the legendary Poirot performers - Albert Finney, Peter Ustinov and David Suchet. Even his Belgian accent seems fake! (And don't get me started on the facial hair!). Some of the oddities he imbues Poirot with are quite unnecessary and feel like quirkiness for quirkiness sake.Unnecessary, just like this movie. Watch the 1974 version instead.",4,2,3,11 September 2018
Sherlock Holmes," Entertaining
","OK, but not great. Not very faithful to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's books, and this detracts from the plot. All the supernatural stuff doesn't help, and the plot has some odd and unnecessary detours. It also drifts at times.Direction from Guy Ritchie is good. Atmosphere is suitably dark and CGI is great.Robert Downey Jr is great in the lead role, and Jude Law puts in a good performance as Doctor Watson.Not a must-see, but reasonably entertaining nevertheless.",6,1,2,23 January 2020
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," Epic war drama
","June 1950. A Seoul family's peaceful existence is shattered by North Korea's attack on the South and the commencement of the Korean War. The family's two sons, Jin-tae and Jin-seok, are conscripted and end up in the same unit. The older brother, Jin-tae, makes it his mission to ensure his brother survives the war, even if it means putting himself in harm's way. Over time Jin-tae becomes more aggressive and brutal, creating a distance between himself and the timid Jin-seok.Epic war-drama, showing several months in the lives of men fighting on the front line. Even more epic when you consider the after-plot, set 50 years later! Shows how war changes people and how it's not for the faint-hearted.Great battle scenes: very grittily shown (i.e. Saving Private Ryan level of realism) plus capturing the perfect confusion and disorientation that is hand-to-hand combat.The film also shows well the effect war has on families and communities, the paranoia that war fosters and the inevitable casualties.Not perfect though. The motivations of the two brothers aren't consistent through time and the whole winning-a-medal-to-get-his-brother-home thing seemed very contrived and implausible. Moreover, the younger brother's blaming every death of a colleague a close friend on his brother got irritating very quickly. His general whineyness and timidness (to the point of cowardice) were pretty annoying.Dialogue is a bit weak too at times, favouring the gung ho variety. Many of the minor actors also over-act, amplifying the gung ho-ness in some scenes.Still, an engrossing and entertaining movie.",8,1,1,25 February 2020
The Waterboy," Silly but entertaining
","Bobby Boucher is 31, lives at home with his mother and is the waterboy for the University of Louisiana Cougars. One day he is fired and ends up being the waterboy for a down-and-out college team, the South Central Louisiana State University Mud Dogs. During an incident in training, Bobby demonstrates himself to be a ferocious tackler, and he is picked for the team's defense. Thanks to him, the Mud Dogs' fortunes soar. However, his mother doesn't approve of him playing football...Silly but entertaining. Started quite weakly, largely using Bobby's disabilities to score cheap laughs. The whole Louisiana inbred/hick thing was laid on pretty thick and got quite tiresome, quite quickly. However, as the movie progresses it gains momentum, shakes off the cheap laughs and becomes reasonably entertaining.Not that it doesn't still have its silly moments towards the end, but these become few and further between.Overall: not a must-see, but if you're looking for something mindlessly entertaining, this isn't so bad.",6,0,1,5 April 2017

","Dory is a forgetful young fish. She was separated from her parents as a child and now she is out to find them. Through the help of a diverse bunch of friends, including a 7-tentacled octopus named Hank, she sets off to find them.Sweet, fun movie, made as a sequel (or prequel) to Finding Nemo. Has many of the same qualities as Finding Nemo - good family fun, some great comedic moments and wonderful animation - incredibly vivid colours and seamless movement. Once again, the voice casting is spot- on and goes a long way to making the movie as good as it is.Not quite as good as Finding Nemo though. The sentimentality in Finding Dory was laid on a bit thick and feels empty and manipulative at times. Finding Nemo felt more subtle and genuine in that regard.",7,0,2,19 April 2017
Stalag 17," An absolute classic
","An absolute classic from Billy Wilder. Great plot - tense, gritty drama, with very funny interludes and dialogue. The only (minor) problem is that sometimes the farce and the drama don't gel.Solid performances all round. William Holden, a Billy Wilder favourite, is great in the lead role (and he got the 1954 Best Actor Oscar for his efforts).Surely the movie that launched the POW drama. You can see influences in this movie in just about every POW movie/series, especially Hogan's Heroes (down to both having a friendly, bumbling German sergeant named Schultz!).",9,1,4,12 April 2015
Arrival," Clever and thought-provoking but a bit underwhelming and derivative
","Aliens have landed on Earth, in 12 different locations. Language professor Louise Banks joins a US army team at one of the locations, in Montana. Her job is to try to learn the aliens' language and enable communication with them. Through regular meetings with two of the aliens she starts to compile a record of the aliens' 'language' - a series of drawn symbols. The important question is - are they friend or foe? Other nations with alien landings are starting to view them as a threat, making it a race against time as war with the aliens could erupt at any moment.Interesting, engaging drama. The concept of aliens arriving and how we deal with them, especially communicate with them, was well thought out. Could have been explored more thoroughly though.The reason it isn't is that the movie takes a sharp detour towards the end. The aliens aren't ultimately the main story, something (or someone) else is. The detour is quite clever, and its point quite thought-provoking.However, due to its late arrival, the second plot isn't explored much at all, just left as a profundity without much room for debate or development. This makes that theme feel a bit half-baked. This is exacerbated by the fact that it comes out of a storyline that had, until then, seemed unimportant and merely there as padding. So the profundity comes out of a story that you weren't that engaged with.In addition, you feel blindsided by this twist. The focus is on and the engagement is with the alien story. When the ultimate theme comes along, the alien story quickly has to make way, making the ending to that feel rushed, contrived and a bit of a damp squib.It also doesn't help that the plot feels a bit derivative, with movies like Contact, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Interstellar springing quickly to mind.Overall: intriguing and entertaining with a clever twist but a bit underwhelming, given its potential.",7,4,10,6 December 2016
The Terminal," Painful
","Victor Navorksi (played by Tom Hanks), a man from the Eastern European nation of Krakozhia, flies into JFK airport. At Customs he is forbidden entry to the USA - Krakozhia has been taken over in a coup and the US does not currently recognise the new regime, or nation. In addition, the borders of Krakozhia are now closed. This leaves Victor in limbo - he cannot enter the US or go back to Krakozhia. While waiting for the diplomatic situation to sort itself out he is forced to live in the International Transit section of JFK, living off his own resourcefulness. He also makes some new friends along the way.Painful to watch. The movie had heaps of potential as a wry look at diplomacy and international politics and how it affects everyday people. Instead director Steven Spielberg tries to make this thought-provoking situation into a comedy.Not that it's funny. Well, maybe if you're 10 years old, it's funny, but if you've got a developed sense of humour or any degree of intelligence, it's not funny at all. 10-year-olds do seem to be the target market as the 'humour' is corny and involves cultural stereotypes, no-speak-English farce and other cheap shots.Continuing the made-for-kids theme, the movie quickly regenerates into a poor downtrodden hero vs all-powerful bad guy caper. Pity that the 'bad guy', the head of security for JFK, is actually trying to help Victor, while doing his job. He gives Victor ample opportunities and avenues to improve his situation but Victor is too stupid to take them. Yet Spielberg makes him the bad guy and Victor the good guy.There is also a romantic drama element to this. Once again, it's more kids' fantasy than anything approaching reality. The catering guy-customs woman story was very stupid and contrived. The Victor- air hostess story was a bit more realistic, but very trite.Tom Hanks delivers easily his most irritating performance, laying on the faux Russian accent and no-speak-English shtick so thick that it is impossible to like Victor. Then we have inconsistencies in character behaviour, sub-plots that go nowhere, random stuff that just happens to sort out a situation, cheesy sentimentality. The only times I liked the movie were when Victor showed some resourcefulness (eg the baggage trolleys/25c).What a mess.",2,1,2,13 August 2016

Characters are steadily and solidly developed, and you feel an empathy for the main characters. Direction by Frank Darabont is subtle, and perfect. Pacing is spot- on.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are excellent in the lead roles. Freeman got a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his efforts.Well deserving of all the praise heaped upon it.

","A poor South Korean family lives in a ramshackle semi-basement apartment and gets by on hustles and cons. One day the son manages to get a job tutoring the child of a wealthy family. He sees an opportunity to get his parents and sister jobs in the household too. Soon all of them of are in and life is looking much rosier. Then fate throws them a curveball.Superb. Written and directed by Bong Joon Ho who gave us the superb crime-drama Memories of Murder plus the entertaining Snowpiercer, Parasite is a great mix of comedy and drama, pathos and social commentary.It starts off in very entertaining fashion as we meet the family that are experts in cons and manipulation. It is quite funny and initially they just seem like slackers. However, after a while it is quite awe-inspiring to see the work that goes into their deceptions.As the movie progresses it becomes darker and darker. The plot takes on a few surprising twists and turns and the two families involved become symbols of a class divide. The social commentary is thought-provoking without being preachy or seeming biased. Powerful ending.Solid performances round out an excellent plot and great direction.",9,12,17,1 February 2020
Rango," Good fun
","Rango is a chameleon. Literally. He is wandering through the desert, having escaped the clutches of a hawk, when he stumbles into the town of Dirt. After massively exaggerating his skills as a gunfighter, challenging the town hoodlum to a duel and (accidentally) killing the town's greatest menace, a large hawk, he is made Sheriff of the town. It is then that he discovers that the town has a massive water shortage. After chasing down some outsiders who robbed the bank, it appears the reason for the shortage may be due to intentional interference, and may be close to home.Good fun. Started pretty badly - plot was over the place and it appeared you needed to be high to enjoy it. However, from a point, around about the saloon scene, the movie finds focus and kicks up several notches. Ends having a decent plot (though a tad derivative of Chinatown), some good humour, great CGI and good action sequences.Vocal casting is spot-on, with Johnny Depp to the fore as Rango. All-star supporting cast delivers in spades.",7,0,0,24 July 2016
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Intelligent, intense, absorbing movie
","Intelligent, intense, absorbing movie.The story of a washed-up actor, Riggan (played by Michael Keaton), who gets a last chance at fame and immortality. He adapts a Raymond Carver novel into a play and directs and stars in it on Broadway. The movie shows the roller-coaster ride that is his mind, plus the behind-the-scenes goings on of the play.Certainly not your average movie. The blurring of the lines between reality and fantasy, as the lead character veers constantly between delusion and actuality, is incredibly intriguing and not a little disconcerting (and this is not necessarily a bad thing). The plot is simultaneously simple and complex - simple main structure but very complex in the intricacies. Ultimately it is a character-driven movie, and the characters are well-developed and complex.On that note, it is not all about Riggan. There are some sub-plots involving his daughter, Sam (played by Emma Stone) plus other cast members. These non-Riggan moments provide for respite from the intensity of Riggan and his issues, and are a welcome relief.While it is the script and direction that set up the movie, it is the performances that complete it - casting is spot-on and the cast act of their skins. Superb performance by Michael Keaton in the lead role - he well deserved his Best Actor Oscar nomination. Good support from Emma Stone, Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, Andrea Riseborough and Amy Ryan. Stone and Norton are excellent and got Supporting Actress/Actor Oscar nominations.Even Zach Galifianakis, better known as a comedy actor, is solid in his role. This movie well deserved its 2015 Best Picture Oscar.",9,0,3,11 June 2015
Centurion," Okay, but not great
","Okay, but not great. Mostly fairly clichéd, with a hole-ridden and often implausible plot. Lacked a feeling of authenticity or edginess. However, the action scenes are great and the scenery is beautiful, and well shot.Performances are varied and mostly overly gung ho. Michael Fassbender is solid in the lead role. Dominic West wrecks any credibility he gained from The Wire by putting in a very unconvincing display.Reasonably entertaining, but could have been better.",6,0,5,18 June 2015
The Big Short," Superb - intriguing, funny, edifying, scary and moving
","Superb - intriguing, funny, edifying, scary and moving.Based on the book by Michael Lewis (writer of Moneyball, Liar's Poker and Flash Boys, amongst others), the true story (though most of the main characters' names have been changed) of a handful of investors who bet against the US mortgage market in 2006-7. Through their own research they discovered that the US mortgage backed securities market was a bubble about to burst, and they invested accordingly. What they didn't initially know was how structurally flawed the MBS system was, the level of corruption in the market...and the impact on the average person when the bubble burst.Incredibly interesting and informative. Maybe you have to know finance and investments (as I do) to understand some of the concepts, but the mechanics of the market and their proposed investment (their big shorts) are fascinating. What is even more interesting is that market so structurally flawed can even exist, especially without any decent regulation...Quite funny too. Director Adam MacKay's previous feature films have all been comedies - Anchorman, The Other Guys, Talladega Nights, Step Brothers - and here he lightens the mood (at relevant times) with some great humour.As the movie goes on, however, it takes on a more serious and sombre tone. This conveys well the impact of the bubble bursting. The ultimate feeling is one of helplessness and anger.Superb performances, especially from Christian Bale and Steve Carell. We expect this from Bale but Carell is starting to throw off his comedy past and put in some fine dramatic performances. Foxcatcher was the start and here he is in fine form again. Considering how different the two characters he played (in Foxcatcher and The Big Short) are, he is not only a good dramatic actor, but one with decent range.Good supporting cast which includes Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt and Marisa Tomei. Margot Robbie, Anthony Bourdain and Selena Gomez appear as themselves and provide some of the film's wackier moments.Ultimately, a great exposition of the greed, stupidity, self- interest and lack of regulation that caused the 2008 Global Financial Crisis.",10,7,11,13 January 2016
The Conjuring," Better than the average horror movie
","Better than the average supernatural-horror movie, not that this says much. Quite gripping and intriguing. Takes time to sketch the background, meet the characters, give some character depth.Ultimately, however, does still rely on the old horror tricks. Eerie music, false starts and smokescreens, waiting for something that takes forever to happen. In spells does feel like a more common-or-garden horror.So, not perfect, or even highly entertaining. (Certainly not in the league of The Exorcist.). Helps if you like horror movies, and I generally don't.",6,0,0,28 July 2014
Platoon," Superb
","Superb.1967. A fresh-out-of-training recruit, Chris (played by Charlie Sheen), arrives in Vietnam and within days is out on patrol in the jungle. His platoon sergeant, Staff Sergeant Barnes (Tom Berenger), is tough-as-nails and a hard taskmaster. His squad leader, Sergeant Elias (Willem Dafoe), cares for his men and tries to help Chris learn and survive. Unfortunately, an incident occurs which sets Barnes against Elias and causes a large amount of friction within the platoon. This, and they still have to fight the Viet Cong...One of the greatest war movies ever made. Certainly in my top 3 Vietnam war movies (the other two being Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket). Incredibly gritty and realistic, with a great sense of what those that fought in Vietnam it went though. A good examination of the morality of war and how war changes people, especially in the heat of battle.Deservedly won the Best Picture Oscar in 1987 with Oliver Stone picking up Best Director. Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger got Best Supporting Actor nominations.",10,2,3,24 January 2016
Prometheus," Entertaining
","Good, but not great. Good action and special effects, and broad plot. However, the finer details of the plot contain many holes, which erode the plausibility of the story. Ultimately, the movie degenerates into twists-from-nowhere and action for the sake of action. A tighter, less twisty, plot would have made this a great movie.Also, the deliberate attempt in the movie to link this to Alien, so it could be billed as a prequel to Alien, was silly. (Yes, I know Ridley Scott directed Alien too). The movie doesn't have to exist as a prequel to Alien - it is fine as standalone movie. Good performance from Noomi Rapace in the lead role. Charlize Theron is surprisingly unconvincing in her role - maybe she just had the worst dialogue, or was involved in some of the sillier plot holes or random jumps.Disappointing, but entertaining enough.",6,0,1,13 February 2016
Halloween," One of the better slasher-horrors
","One of the better slasher-horrors. Not that this says much. Good slasher-horrors are few and far-between. Mostly formulaic and made with the lowest common denominator in mind.Halloween has some of those clichés and formulaic elements, but it largely invented them! What sets this apart is the plot development and tension. John Carpenter builds the story slowly, drawing you in. You know something is going to happen, but you don't know when, and to whom.Then, when it does happen, it becomes a roller-coaster ride of terror and action.Ending is a bit disappointing, especially as now, 36 years later, you know it was set up for a sequel, and another, and another, and then a remake... The sequels severely devalued the original movie.",7,0,1,2 November 2014
The Water Diviner," Well-intentioned but clumsy
","Well-intentioned but clumsy.It is 1919 and, after his wife's death, an Australian man, Connor (played by Russell Crowe), goes to Turkey to find the graves and remains of the three sons he lost at Gallipoli in World War 1. The movie is a bit of a hit-and-miss affair. The search for his sons (which turns out to be much more complicated than anticipated) is quite an emotional journey. Along the way we see how they died, and experience the wastefulness and futility of war. We also see the war from the eyes of Turkish people, who also lost many loved ones in the war, often to Australians. On the other hand, many of the scenes don't seem written or staged well, giving the movie a rickety sort of feel. The whole romance angle seems out of place too.Overall, a decent and watchable attempt by Russell Crowe on his directorial debut. A bit more tightness in the script and polish in direction and this would have been a great movie.",6,4,8,14 December 2015
Wonder Woman," Better than most comic-book movies (not that this says much)
","Picking up from where Batman vs Superman left off, Diana Prince / Wonder Woman has been approached by Bruce Wayne / Batman to form a crime-fighting partnership. A photograph from WW1 sparks memories of her childhood, the daughter of the Queen of the Amazons, growing up and meeting, in WW1, Steve Trevor, an American spy. He will give her life purpose, cause her to leave the shelter of her home island and help her integrate into society. Most importantly, he will help her find and confront the arch-enemy of the Amazons - Ares, the God of War.Better than most comic-book movies (not that this says much). Good set up and decent plot development, combined with an attention- grabbing appearance from Gal Gadot (and I'm not referring to her acting). Initially manages to not overdo the usual fantasy / sci fi bs, giving you hope that this might not degenerate into the usual special effects-driven nonsense that makes comic-book movies so empty and predictable.However, this was too good to last. From a point it is all about the CGI-driven action scenes, complete with fantasy gobbledygook and improbable, out-of-the-blue outcomes. So it ends pretty much as your standard comic book movie.Overall, okay and worth watching, but not a must-see.",6,1,7,1 October 2017
Despicable Me," Good fun
","Sweet, feel-good movie. Quite predicable and not laugh-a-minute funny, and mostly quite empty for most of the movie, it has a good heart and finished strongly. Probably more a kids movie than an adults movie though.Animation is great. Voice stars are interesting, as you wouldn't know it was them, the impressions are so original: Steve Carell, Russell Brand, Jason Segel, Julie Andrews. Even has Jermaine Clement (of Flight of the Conchords), Will Arnett, Kristen Wiig, Danny McBride and Jack McBrayer (of 30 Rock) in minor roles.Not a classic, but good fun nevertheless.",6,0,0,16 June 2014
Carrie," Enthralling drama
","An enthralling drama. More than just a horror movie - the movie is also about growing up, school and all its trials and tribulations: peer pressure, bullying, fitting in (or not) and wacky, non- understanding parents.Interesting, intriguing set up. Director Brian De Palma builds the intensity and menace well. Great climax too.However, once we have the climax of the prom night scene, the movie seems to fizzle out after that. It's as if De Palma, or writer Stephen King, didn't know what to do after that. The conclusion is very weak.This movie launched scores of careers. This was Stephen King's first movie (or TV) credit. His next cinema movie would be The Shining. Since Carrie he has received 184 (and counting) writing credits, on cinema movies and on on TV.Brian De Palma had directed several movies before this, with little success. Carrie got him noticed.This was Sissy Spacek's 3rd cinema movie, Amy Irving's 1st and John Travolta's 1st. Travolta's next cinema movie was Saturday Night Fever...",7,1,4,29 November 2014
Marriage Story," Good but takes a fair bit of patience
","Charlie and Nicole are separating. With a young son to think about they intend to do it all fairly and amicably with no animosity. But then the lawyers get involved.I watched this expecting a much more gritty exposition on relationships than the cheap romantic dramas which seem to litter the cinematic landscape. My favourite romantic dramas tend to be ones where things don't work out (e.g. 500 Days of Summer, In The Mood For Love, the marriage-breakdown story in Love Actually) as they make for much more original and interesting stories than your usual trite happily-ever-after stuff.Initially Marriage Story is quite disappointing though. It moves at a snail's pace and nothing really happens until about 40 minutes in. Viewer patience is rewarded though as things do get much better eventually. Once the parasitic lawyers get involved the plot becomes much more interesting and the pace speeds up as the situation spirals out of control. It also demonstrates that divorce only ever benefits the lawyers.These plot developments do also take the movie into unoriginal territory, as Kramer vs Kramer already covered the trauma, trials and tribulations of a divorce, and did it better, covering it more intensely and engagingly.As the movie goes on it becomes more profound and engaging and the ending is very powerful and emotional. The performances of Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson also help drive this quality, especially towards the end when their relationship is at its nadir. The confrontational scene between them near the end is superb.A tighter first Act and this would have been a much more engaging and compelling drama.",7,5,6,27 January 2020
The Queen," Okay, but not that engaging
","Okay, but not that engaging.A movie about dealing with tragedy...when you're the Queen of England. In the aftermath of Princess Diana being killed by the paparazzi in 1997, the Royal family reacts with stoicism. However, this gets read as indifference by the English population and public opinion soon turns against the Royal family (spurred on by the media, of course). Prime Minister Tony Blair, riding a massive wave of popularity, tries to help them with their PR problems...Interesting and novel in that it this movie gives a look into the private lives of monarchy during a time of grief and vulnerability. However, there is a large degree of detachment for the audience: we can't relate to them. Plus, much of the plot involves politics, PR and the politics of monarchy, and none of these are appealing subjects.Some of this distance is made up by great, convincing performances from Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth and Michael Sheen as Tony Blair. Mirren got a Best Actress Oscar for her performance.Overall, interesting and watchable, but not a must-see.",6,2,4,14 November 2015
Raging Bull," Brilliant
","The story of Jake La Motta, boxer and world middleweight champion.Brilliant. Directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Robert De Niro, Raging Bull is far from your average boxing movie. Most boxing movies focus on the boxing, showing the main character as a hero and how they get to their inevitable success. Raging Bull on the other hand, while showing La Motta's successful career, doesn't paint him as perfect. Far from it: he is shown warts and all.Scorsese shows quite well that what made La Motta great in the ring made him less great in his personal life. The intensity and brutality that made La Motta such a good fighter made him a less-than-perfect husband and person.Who better then to portray an intense, complicated person than Robert De Niro. He gives a superb performance, for which he won his second (and final) Best Actor Oscar. Searingly gritty and intense.",9,1,1,28 June 2019
The Iron Giant," Predictable and dull, but kids will like it
","1957, the Russians have just launched Sputnik and Cold War fear and paranoia is the order of the day. Hogarth Hughes lives with his mom, Annie, in the small town of Rockwell, Maine. One day a very large robot lands on earth from outer space. After some adventures, Hogarth befriends the robot. However, the US government has sent a special agent to investigate the strange occurrences in the area (unbeknownst to them, caused by the robot) and his intentions towards what's causing the phenomena are less benevolent.Predictable and dull. Quite conventional, linear story with an overused, unoriginal story line. Replace the robot with any other harmless creature that a kid might befriend but the authorities will be suspicious of and you have the plot for heaps of children's movies. Doesn't add anything new or profound and is only mildly entertaining.Kids should like it though. Is essentially a made-for-kids movie and they won't be disappointed.",5,0,2,17 November 2017

Straight Outta Compton," Great movie, even if you're not into hip-hop or rap
","Great movie, even if you're not into hip-hop or rap (and I generally am not).The true story of the hip-hop / rap band NWA who emerged from the mean streets of Compton in Los Angeles to be the voice of African- Americans living on the wrong side of the tracks. Much more than just a movie about a hip-hop / rap, but a movie about social injustice and police brutality. At the very least it can be taken as an example of the rise, fall and aftermath of a band, and the pluses and minuses of the music industry, especially its seedy side.Good performances from O'Shea Jackson Jr, playing Ice Cube, his father, Corey Hawkins as Dr Dre, Jason Mitchell as Eazy-E and Paul Giamatti as Jerry Heller, NWA's manager. Solid supporting cast.Not perfect though: the movie does drift in the latter third or so. It's as if the writers and director didn't know when to end it, or at least know how to compress the post-breakup era into something succinct and engaging. I realise that the story of Eazy-E had to be told, but there surely must have been a quicker and/or more engaging way to tell that part of the story.",8,12,45,5 September 2015
Mary and Max," Wonderful, heart-warming, thought-provoking movie
","Wonderful, heart-warming, thought-provoking movie.It's 1976. Mary is an eight year old girl living in Melbourne. Her mother is an alcoholic (and a mean one at that) and her father is...distant. Nothing seems to be going right. Then she randomly writes to a stranger in New York, Max, and they become pen-pals. What follows is a wonderful friendship and journey...Great movie with incredible warmth and depth. Sensitively explores subjects like depression, Asperger's Syndrome (and mental illness in general), loneliness and friendship. All this while delivering some sharp, often dark, humour. Not unnecessarily politically correct either - I'm sure there's enough in the movie to offend the humourless, dial-a-complaint crowd. Quite real and gritty.Great, original animation. However, don't be fooled by the animation - this is certainly not a kid's movie. While it may seem suitable for kids initially, it explores some very dark themes towards the end.Good voice casting too, with Toni Collette as Mary, Philip Seymour Hoffman as Max and narration by Barry Humphries plus a supporting cast that includes Eric Bana.Superb.",9,1,4,8 October 2015
Saints and Soldiers," OK,ish
","OK, ish. Had potential, but the historical inaccuracies, plot holes, superficial moralising and other contrivances damage the movie. Action sequences are good though.I suspect this was made to cash in on the success of the superb Band of Brothers, especially as one episode of that series covered the 101st Airborne Division's involvement in the Battle of the Bulge. Making the unit involved in Saints and Soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division, even though no members of the 101st were at the Malmedy massacre, reeks of poetic abuse.",5,1,1,24 April 2014
The Silence of the Lambs," Great, tense thriller
","Great, tense thriller.An FBI agent-in-training, Clarice Starling (played by Jodie Foster) is given an assignment to interview infamous serial killer, Dr Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). He has been imprisoned in a mental hospital/prison for the last eight years. The reason to seek out Dr Lecter is that another serial killer, 'Buffalo Bill' has killed and skinned five woman and the FBI feels Dr Lecter might have some insights into who he is. Then Buffalo Bill kidnaps a Senator's daughter and finding him becomes even more urgent. Great psychological drama. Plot is fine, though one or two developments felt a bit contrived. As much a character-driven drama as a plot- driven one, as we have a battle of wits between Lecter, Starling, a psychiatrist and Buffalo Bill and individual personalities play a part in the outcome. As the movie progresses the tension is ratcheted up well by director Jonathan Demme. The last few scenes are incredibly tense and claustrophobic.Great work by Anthony Hopkins as Lecter. Well deserved his Best Actor Oscar. Jodie Foster is solid as Starling and also got an Oscar for her efforts. Decent supporting cast too.",9,2,3,28 March 2016

","Quite dull, despite the subject matter.A young University student, Anastasia Steele (played by Dakota Johnson), interviews a young billionaire, Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). Their relationship develops but it turns out his idea of a relationship is not that conventional...Quite formulaic, predictable, pointless and dull. You would think that a movie that involves bondage and sadomasochism would have some level of intrigue and watchability but, strangely, it does not. For all its titillation, it is quite lifeless and perfunctory. Maybe it's because the characters are not developed. Maybe it is because the actors just seem to be going through the motions. Maybe it is because this is really just a (tad perverse) romantic drama (and even on that level it fails as it goes nowhere).No, nothing good about this. Avoid.",4,0,1,26 November 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," Good, but not great
","Good, but not great. Excellent special effects and action sequences. However, the plot often drifts, is not water-tight and sometimes feels contrived.

Tom Hardy is a touch one-dimensional as Bane, and often incomprehensible - the mask doesn't help.Not as good as The Dark Knight, but entertaining nonetheless.",7,0,1,21 March 2014

Now not only must he govern his country but defeat a dangerous adversary.An average comic book / superhero movie, which doesn't say much. Massively over-hyped and over-praised, largely because of the racial angle. What you have is ultimately nothing new: the usual action and CGI-centric storyline, the basic, wafer-thin plot, the token character development, i.e. just another Avengers-type movie.This is not a revolutionary movie in terms of breaking stereotypes - if you're looking for that, watch In The Heat Of The Night (1967), or any one of several Sidney Poitier movies, instead.",4,4,6,10 November 2018

Mother!," Pretentious and annoying
","A married couple live in an isolated country house. He is a celebrated poet, suffering from writer's block, and she is working on renovating the house. Then a guest, a stranger, suddenly drops in and nothing will ever be the same again. Written and directed by Darren Aronofsky who gave us masterpieces like 'The Wrestler' and 'Requiem for a Dream', as well as the excellent 'Black Swan'. The fact that he wrote and directed this was the only reason I watched it, hoping that he was back to the form of those movies as his previous movie was the craptacular-beyond-belief 'Noah'.Unfortunately, no, he isn't, though initially there was a glimmer of hope. The movie started interestingly enough, with some decent character development and some interesting themes. However, from the outset it was slow, plus there were signs this wasn't going to be a character-based drama but something symbolic, and pretentious.Plus it was annoying. The only likeable character was Jennifer Lawrence's. Javier Bardem's was selfish and egotistical and every single other character was incredibly irritating. Still, I was hoping this would all develop into something interesting and profound. Wrong again. It develops into anarchy and some sort of badly-thought-out horror movie, and the annoyance factor gets pushed to the max. Of course, it's all meant to be symbolic, but figuring out everything would require you to think about the movie, and do so you would have had to have concentrated all through the tidal wave of excrement that was the movie.Pretentious and annoying, and evidence that, sadly, Darren Aronofsky has run out of ideas.",2,1,2,22 July 2018
Creed II," Great: continues in the same vein as the first movie
","Adonis Creed is heavyweight champion of the world. To defend his title, he accepts a challenge from someone with a very close connection to Creed: Viktor Drago, the son of Ivan Drago, the man who killed Creed's father Apollo in the ring. Ivan is coaching his son and is determined to win the belt that Rocky took from him. Viktor Drago is unstoppable and Creed's odds against him are slim.To my surprise, I enjoyed the first Creed movie. I was never a fan of the Rocky movies and I figured Creed was just going to be Rocky rebooted.Turns out it was better than that. Rather than style over substance it had character depth and good plot development. The characters were engaging and the story was interesting.Creed II continues in the same vein with an interesting plot and decently drawn characters. Maybe not as engaging as the first movie, but the intrigue of the David vs Goliath battle between Creed and Drago makes up for that.Like the first Creed, this movie ties in with a Rocky storyline, so once again we have a refreshing of the Rocky story and a handing over to the new Rocky, Creed.",8,2,2,4 December 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Even worse than it is made out to be
","After saving Lois Lane from a terrorist group, Superman is accused of killing innocent civilians in the process, leading him to no longer be universally viewed as a benevolent force. Meanwhile Batman is dispensing his own justice, and is branded a vigilante. Batman views Superman as a threat to humanity, and Lex Luther is happy to fan the flames...I wasn't expecting much, but was initially pleasantly surprised by this movie. The background was interesting, and the whole 'Clark Kent meets Bruce Wayne but they don't know they're Superman and Batman' interaction was intriguing.However, this quickly unraveled. Superman fighting Batman was always a preposterous idea, both in its likelihood and inevitability of the result. The logic and events behind them confronting each other is incredibly contrived and lame, and the fight and its result even more so.From then on it's just your usual comic book movie CGI and fight scenes, and even more mindless than normal, if that was possible. Well, the director is Zack Snyder...you weren't expecting any substance with that rather expensively generated style, were you? Throw in a script that seems written by a 10-year old and incredibly irritating acting by Jesse Eisenberg and you have a pretty poor movie. The only positives are the performance of Ben Affleck and the appearance of Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. Even Affleck at times seems unable to believe the crap he's forced to do and say...",3,2,6,14 August 2017
Tombstone," Rollicking, entertaining western
","Rollicking, entertaining western. Focuses on Wyatt Earp and his brothers and Doc Holliday and their time in Tombstone, Arizona in the 1880s. For most people that story starts and ends with the gunfight at the OK Corral, but that event is only one scene in this movie. This shows how that was actually part of a much bigger picture, and wasn't anywhere near the end of it.Decent plot that keeps moving along at a brisk pace. Some attempts at character development, but it is mostly superficial. Dialogue can be a bit gung ho at times but is generally fine.Star-studded cast, even among the minor roles. Just about everyone involved is a known actor now. Some may have been unknowns at the time, but are stars today, eg Billy Bob Thornton who has a handful of lines, Thomas Haden Church.

The Greatest Showman," Much style, little substance
","The story of PT Barnum, famous for founding Barnum and Bailey Circus and revolutionising entertainment.Much style, little substance. Some of this is to be expected, as you can't have a movie on a showman extraordinaire and one of the most significant figures in entertainment history without a large amount of pizzazz.However, the movie doesn't really give us much of Barnum's history or motivations. The main focus seems to be on cramming as many song and dance numbers into the movie as possible, at the expense of any plot. For every minute of plot or character development you have four minutes of musical numbers.To crown it all, the music is poor and irritating. Every musical number sounds like something from a made-for-kids animated Disney movie, rather than a biopic. The movie is set in the mid-1800s yet we have ultra-contemporary numbers. It is quite jarring and negates any semblance of historical accuracy, credibility or substance.",4,3,4,16 May 2019

What follows is an epic tale of survival, determination and revenge.An epic in many ways: the larger-than-life sets (the chariot race takes the cake), the scale of it (time and distance-wise) and the running time. Unfortunately, that's all there is to recommend for this movie as it is otherwise just a long, conventional, linear story.

","The Toy Story series shows no sign of running out of steam. Quite the opposite - it is getting better. Great, sweet, funny, fun movie. Innovative plot and direction. Great CGI.Casting and voices are spot-on.Superb.",8,1,1,14 July 2018
Trainspotting," Funny, gritty, harrowing...and brilliant
","Funny, gritty, harrowing...and brilliant.Set in Edinburgh, Scotland, we follow the life of Renton (played by Ewen McGregor). Despite attempts to get clean, he is a heroin addict, as are his friends Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller) and Spud (Ewen Bremner). We see their lives and how drugs affect them, their friends and their friendship. Meanwhile, another friend, Begbie (Robert Carlyle), is not a drug addict but gets his highs from confrontation and violence... The second movie by Danny Boyle. His first, Shallow Grave, was excellent. This is even better.Hilariously funny at times yet incredibly dark and gritty too. The drug scene and effects of drugs are certainly not glamorised - we why they do it, how difficult it is to break the addition, the short-term consequences...and the long-term ones. Not as confronting or as gritty as Requiem for a Dream or Christiane F in terms of showing the effects of drug abuse but still a fairly harrowing ordeal. Besides, those movies didn't have any humour in them..Good plot, though the ending feels like too much of a soft landing. The conclusion would be the only negative, and it is a minor one, and really open to taste. I would have preferred a tougher ending, that's all.Solid performances all round. This is the movie that launched the career of Ewen McGregor (though Shallow Grave readied it for takeoff). Great soundtrack, with songs from Iggy Pop, Lou Reed, Elastica, Pulp, Blur, New Order and Primal Scream, among others.A great exploration of drug abuse and its consequences, humorously told.",10,0,1,31 January 2016
La Vie En Rose," Dull

Before Sunrise," Nope, it's still just another romantic drama
","OK, but not great. Put off watching this because it looked a common-or- garden romantic drama. However the 8/10 average rating on IMDb made me think there is more to this than that. Turns out: not really.Is pretty much just another romantic drama. Better than most in that it has more depth of characters, has a fairly unique and beautiful setting, and direction and plot are more subtle and original than most. On the down side, some of the dialogue is incredibly pretentious, navel-gazing crap. Reasonably good performances from Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, even though I found Hawke's character a bit irritating.For a much better crafting of a theme of strangers who become close friends yet know they must soon part, never to see each other again, see Lost in Translation.",6,1,2,27 August 2014
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," The first time I've not liked a Woody Allen movie
","The first time I've not liked a Woody Allen movie.I am a fan of Woody Allen, and can't think of a movie of his I don't like (until now). I thought 'Match Point' was great and liked 'Scoop', so when critics started to say he was passed his prime I dismissed their criticisms. 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona', however, I found fairly boring. The jokes were few and far between, and I found the emotional- drama side overwrought and a touch pretentious. The great cast could not save this, though Penelope Cruz's over-the-top performance was fantastic.On the plus side, some of the humour is very memorable, and the scenery is great.",4,1,1,22 July 2015
The Deer Hunter," Brilliant - a powerful examination of war and its consequences
","Brilliant - a powerful examination of war and its consequences.Set in a a small industrial Pennsylvania town during the Vietnam War. Three friends - Mike (played by Robert De Niro), Nick (Christopher Walken) and Steve (John Savage) - are getting ready to join the Army. In their last few days before leaving we see them going about their lives - drinking, hunting...and, in Steve's case, getting married. Soon they will be confronted by the harsh realities of war.A thought-provoking, emotional and, to a great extent, depressing journey. We see how the war affects these men, and their community. There are physical effects for some, but there are also mental and emotional effects. Nothing will ever be the same again.Incredibly well made by director Michael Cimino. He painstaking paints you a picture of the men and their close-knit community - for example, the wedding scene seems to go on forever but is vital to the ultimate plot. The seemingly innocuous everyday things provide the contrast for later.Great performances help too. Here we have Robert De Niro at his most heroic...and most vulnerable. We also have the performance which shot Christopher Walken to fame. Plus we have Meryl Streep, who doesn't deliver bad performances. Walken won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar, De Niro was nominated for Best Actor and Streep was nominated for Best Supporting Actress.",10,0,2,25 January 2016
Identity," Good, but not great
","Good, but not great. Started off quite lamely, and seemed like it was just going to be another average slasher-whodunit-thriller. However, the first twist made it into an interesting psychological drama. This twist was not enough to sustain the movie though, and the second twist just seemed gratuitous, for the sake of a climactic ending.Reasonably entertaining and intriguing though, despite all its faults.Performances are so-so. Amanda Peet is about the only actor/actress that shines. John Cusack and Ray Liotta should be the stars but just seem like they're trying too hard. John C McGinley is irritating in his role - he should stick to comedy.",6,1,4,14 July 2014
Saving Mr. Banks," Takes perseverance
","This movie takes a lot of perseverance to get through. The first half-to-three quarters of the movie is quite painful and difficult to endure. The character of PL Travers is so irritating you feel like walking out. Furthermore, there is a seemingly unrelated story being told at the same time, set in Australia. The sheer nails-on-blackboard painfulness of PL Travers and the random, perplexing nature of the parallel story seem like recipes for disaster.However, there is a moment of clarity and profundity, where everything falls into place. From then on the movie makes sense, Mrs Travers' character ceases to be a pain, the movie is quite emotional and interesting. Moreover, it ends on a high note.It's just a pity the good stuff takes so long to arrive. Ultimately, I only liked the movie because of how it ended. The destination was good, but the journey was painful and one I could easily have given up on.",6,3,6,16 October 2014
Jojo Rabbit," Superb: wonderfully funny, emotional and profound
","World War 2. Jojo is a 10-year-old German boy and a zealous follower of Hitler. He even has an imaginary friend, Adolf, who resembles Hitler and who motivates him and guides his actions. Then one day he finds a Jewish girl hiding in his house.Superb. Written and directed by Taika Waititi, who wrote and directed the excellent 'What We Do In the Shadows' plus 'Hunt For The Wilderpeople' and 'Boy' and directed 'Thor: Ragnarok'. While Waititi is more renowned as a comedic director (though many of his films have dramatic elements to them), Jojo Rabbit is a great balance between comedy and drama.Initially this combination of comedy and drama is a bit jarring, as you'll have some great comedy moments mixed in with some deadly serious, even tragic, dramatic moments. One moment you'll have an hilarious scene where the Nazis are being made fun of, the next you see the tragic effects of their regime. This two-tone approach initially makes the movie quite unsettling.However, from a point the comedy-drama divide follows a rhythm and things settle down. As the movie goes on the tone becomes more consistently serious, leading to a powerful, profound, emotional conclusion.Solid performances by Ronan Griffin Davis as Jojo, Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa and Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother. Waititi himself takes on the Hitler role and does a great job. Outstanding performance of the movie goes to Sam Rockwell as Captain Klenzendorf, the jaded, alcoholic German Army officer. Absolutely hilarious.Good supporting cast that includes Alfie Allen, Rebel Wilson and Stephen Merchant.",9,5,10,31 December 2019
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Something for everyone
","2009 was a great year for animated movies - first the excellent 'Up', now this sweet, beautiful, feel-good movie. Wes Anderson, director of such modern classics as Royal Tenenbaums and Rushmore, takes a Roald Dahl novel, and makes a superb movie out of it. Funny, witty, perfectly-paced, the plot and direction are spot-on. The animation is great and the choice of actors for the voices was inspired. George Clooney as Mr Fox is suave and sophisticated yet impishly naughty. Meryl Streep adds gravitas and motherly concern as Mrs Fox. Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray, ever-present in Wes Anderson movies, are perfect for their roles as the kid fox and the wise-cracking badger- lawyer, respectively. Even the minor parts have major names: Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe and Michael Gambon plus Jarvis Cocker (lead-singer of Pulp, in case you didn't know) as the folk-singing sidekick of one of the villains!All this, and then Wes Anderson's customary perfectly-chosen rocking soundtrack.It may be animated, but this isn't just for kids - it has something for everyone. A must-see: you won't be disappointed.",9,0,1,2 April 2014
Live Free or Die Hard," Entertaining
","I am not a fan of special effects-are-everything action movies, so I set my standards rather low for this one, to avoid disappointment. Turned out to be reasonably enjoyable.

Lucy," Intriguing idea...which fails to deliver
","Intriguing idea...which fails to deliver.A woman, Lucy (played by Scarlett Johansson), is kidnapped by a gang in Taiwan. Drugs are hidden in her body but these are accidentally absorbed, causing her to use far more of her brain power than any human. With power comes responsibility...The movie was initially quite interesting. Yes, the whole 'we only use 10% of our brain' premise is just a myth and is actually absolute nonsense - we use our brain pretty much to its capacity. However, there was room for a interesting story on what we could and should do if we could extend our brain power.It's a pity then that it just took a random direction, turning into a 'look at what I can do with CGI' display by director Luc Besson, rather than a coherent story. What follows is far from profound or satisfying.It also became an action-drama, but even there it didn't really cover new ground. Pretty much your standard good guys vs bad guys shoot- outs.Disappointing.",5,4,8,21 July 2015
Moonrise Kingdom," Sweet and entertaining
","If you know Wes Anderson's movies, you know the feel of his movies: sweet, innocent, light-hearted, funny yet emotional. Moonrise Kingdom is no exception. A story which could have been awkward and become mired in emotional navel-gazing, moves along at a brisk pace. The subtle humour is there, the emotion is there, the innocence is there. Just when you think it has reached a place where it is going to drift for the rest of the movie, the story veers away to chart new territory.Great performances by the all-star adult cast: Bill Murray (wouldn't be a Wes Anderson movie without him!), Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Frances McDormand, with minor appearances by Tilda Swinton, Harvey Keitel and Jason Schwartzman. The kids in the lead roles - Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward - are OK, but not great. It is sometimes difficult to make out what they are saying.Ultimately, not very profound, but very sweet and entertaining.",8,0,0,30 August 2015
The Sixth Sense," M Night Shyamalan's sleight-of-hand masterpiece
","M Night Shyamalan's sleight-of-hand masterpiece.A child psychologist, Dr Malcolm Crowe (played by Bruce Willis), is shot by a deranged former patient of his, Vincent Grey. Grey then kills himself. A few months later he is counseling a boy, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who shows similar symptoms to Grey. He is worried that Cole will go down the same path. However, Cole has certain special, supernatural abilities...Great movie with a brilliant twist at the end. For the most part it feels like a slow-burning horror movie. Writer-director M Night Shyamalan, directing his third movie (though the first two were very low-key), expertly builds the tension and intrigue. The twist, when it comes, is so unexpected, but works so well and fits so perfectly with the plot. Even watching the movie a second time you are hard-pressed to fault how the twist fits in with the plot.Some great drama too, and quite emotional at times, especially towards the end.Solid performance by Bruce Willis in the lead role. Good work from Haley Joel Osment as the boy. Good support from Toni Collette and Olivia Williams. Osment and Collette got Supporting Actor/Actress Oscar nominations for their performances.Just a pity Shyamalan couldn't reproduce this form in any of his subsequent movies. His next movie, 'Unbreakable', was good, but not brilliant. 'Signs' was mediocre and 'The Village' was okay, but not great. After that his movies were very bad - 'Lady in the Water', 'The Happening' and 'The Last Airbender' were very silly and pointless. One keeps hoping for a return to the creative brilliance that was The Sixth Sense but, considering how his movies seem to get worse with every attempt, this may be hoping too much.",10,0,1,2 January 2016
The Producers," Superb debut by Mel Brooks
","Max Bialystock is a theatre producer. His fortunes are at a low when his accountant, Leo Bloom, discovers a loophole that should see things turn around: deliberately produce a flop!Mel Brooks' debut as a movie director and writer, and what a debut it was! Set the tone for all his movies - great slapstick, over-the-top, but not silly comedy. Clever plot, intelligently directed. Possibly needs to be longer - you feel there is still a lot to be milked out of the idea, and a few more details would not drag on the movie.Great performances all round. Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder are superb in the lead roles. Casting is spot-on.",8,1,2,28 December 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Entertaining
","30 years after the Empire was destroyed, an equally-malevolent empire, The First Order, has taken its place. The Resistance, lead by Princess/General Leia, is harrying The First Order as best it can. The First Order decides to hunt down the last Jedi knight, Luke Skywalker, who is in secluded retirement in a secret place. A map exists of his whereabouts and this is in the possession of a droid, BB-8, accompanied by a renegade stormtrooper, Finn, and an unassuming scavenger girl, Rey.Rollicking good fun. I'm not a Star Wars fan - the original movies were okay but not great and the prequels were quite dull. However, this grabbed my attention from the outset and held it all the way through.Plot is largely one long action-adventure, but there is a bit more to this than your standard linear adventure. The link to the first three movies was well done, with Han Solo, Chewbacca, Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, C3PO and R2D2 being used in relevant ways in the plot. I was worried that the movie would revolve around them, but they are used sparingly and appropriately, while still creating a sense of nostalgia, history and reverence for what occurred in the initial three movies. Moreover, there is a feeling of the torch being passed on to the new heroes of Star Wars.Great special effects, as you would expect from director JJ Abrams.Solid performances all round. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher provide the gravitas while the new generation - Daisy Ridley (especially), Oscar Isaac, John Boyega - provide the action and energy.",7,3,26,15 April 2016
Flight," Powerful movie
","Powerful, moving movie. Probably the best movie on the effects of alcoholism since 'Leaving Las Vegas' in 1995. Original and unpredictable. The actual aim of the movie is not apparent initially - it looks like surviving disaster movie, then a romance. Even once the true aim is known, you don't know how it is all going to end.Not perfect though. Certain scenes just seem superfluous. The relationship angle seems badly developed, and almost unnecessary. Some scenes, especially any involving John Goodman, seem to glorify Captain Whitaker's addictions.Good performance by Denzel Washington in the lead role. Not sure it deserved an Oscar nomination, but a good performance nevertheless. Good support from Kelly Reilly, Bruce Greenwood and Don Cheadle. John Goodman possibly overdoes the cool-stoner-dude shtick.",8,1,2,20 February 2014
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Good riddance.
","The series ends, at last. Good riddance. (Until JK Rowling needs money, I guess).The first Harry Potter was interesting, and good fun. Much of this was due to the novelty of it all. The first Harry Potter introduced us to the characters and concepts of the series.The second used that template and provides another plot. The plot was fairly mundane and overwrought. At nearly three hours it was ridiculously long for a linear plot-driven kid's adventure story.This is all said, there was a momentum that kept it going. There were some new concepts and characters. All this was enough to make it marginally likable.By the third, however, it was a tired formula. From then on it was all about gouging more money from kids and nerds.Rating for this last one should be lower, but it gets a bonus point for finally ending this seemingly-never-ending, sequels-for-the-sake-of-more-money series.",3,4,6,26 January 2014
Unbroken," Epic (true) story of survival and endurance
","Epic (true) story of survival and endurance.The true story of Louis Zamperini. A long-distance runner, he represented the US in the 1936 Olympics. In World War 2 he became a bombardier in a B-24 Liberator in the Pacific. One day, however, his plane is forced to crash land in the ocean and he and the pilot spend over 40 days adrift at sea before the Japanese capture them and send them to a Prisoner of War camp. The camp has a particularly sadistic commander and Zamperini comes in for some particularly vicious treatment, putting his perseverance and endurance to the ultimate test...Very engaging and compelling movie. Yes, it has been done before (in various forms) - Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence, The Railway Man, Paradise Road, Bridge on the River Kwai - but this does not make this movie any less original or unpredictable. Despite its fairly long running time - over 2 1/4 hours - I was engrossed the entire time.Good special effects and solid direction from Angelina Jolie on her directorial debut.Good performance from Jack O'Connell in the lead role with solid support from Domnhall Gleeson, Garrett Hedlund and Miyavi.Don't believe all the negative publicity (which seems mostly driven by sexism) - this movie is well worth watching.",8,0,0,14 December 2015
Rear Window," One of the greatest movies ever made
","If ever you needed an example of cinema as an art form, this is it. Amazingly brilliant. The plot and dialogue are great on their own, but, as always, it is Hitchcock's direction that turns this into a masterpiece. He pulls out every trick here - the clever setting of a man being able to view other people's everyday lives from afar, the camera angles, the scene setting, the character building, the growing suspense. In the end the plot doesn't matter, you just want to soak in all of Hitchcock's cinematic genius.Another key factor to the brilliance of this movie is the Jimmy Stewart- Grace Kelly interaction. They are both superb in their roles, but together they are even better. For me, this is Hitchcock's magnum opus. Yes, even better than Psycho, which to some may be a sacrilegious thing to say, but it shows how good it is. Surely one of the greatest movies ever made.",10,0,3,19 April 2014

The Purge," A new personal best
","This movie set a new record with me: quickest I've ever lost interest in a movie. Took about a minute for me to lose interest. More than that, it only took about five minutes for me to be annoyed by it.Silly premise, clumsy, one-dimensional plot. If mindless violence is what you're looking for in a movie, this is it.Furthermore, the plot is full of holes.I kept hoping that there was some point to all this, but it never happened. There was so much potential for a profound statement on social divides, but any wanderings into that area were very superficial. There was also a massive opportunity to point out the need for gun control in the US, but that didn't happen. Wouldn't want to alienate all the right-wing gun-toting Second Amendment-quoting nutjobs in the US now, would we? They're the target audience...Nothing to like about this movie (except Adelaide Kane...)",1,2,3,24 May 2014
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," As bad as the first one, if not worse
","As bad as the first Hunger Games movie, if not worse. The first one was also a vastly over-rated movie. Clearly meant for teenagers: trite romance; contrived, hole-filled plot; Disney-style happy ending. (Though at 2 1/2 hours it is way too long for teenagers' concentration spans). Take out most of the first hour or so, as this was all just padding and didn't develop the characters or plot much; give it a more realistic, gritty feel and take out the Disney romance, sentimentality and ending and this could have been a decent movie. In its current form it is boring and crap.This one has less syrupy, Disney romance, thankfully, but doesn't really replace it with anything substantial. There are stabs at intrigue and the idea of an anti-government revolution, but none of these really go anywhere. Everything is just padding before, and a set up to, the survival fight. So, it is just the same as the first one, really.If they had worked more on the anti-government stuff and not just made it all about some pointless action scenes at the end, it could have been an interesting movie.As I pointed out with the first movie, if you want a good, gritty, Last Person Standing / Survival of the Fittest-type movie, watch Battle Royale instead. The Hunger Games movies are neither good nor gritty.",3,12,22,30 September 2014

However, less than full use is made of the ingenious concepts in the plot and the movie flounders in sentimentality towards the end. Ending is not entirely satisfactory.Solid performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis and Emily Blunt. JG-L's performance is a bit off-putting though, due to the weird facial modifications. The idea was to make him look like a young Bruce Willis, but it doesn't work. If anything, it's like the producers grafted Daniel Craig's face onto JG-L's body.

Heat," Brilliant
","Brilliant action-drama-thriller. Directed by Michael Mann, and starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Historic in that this is the only movie that these two mega-legends of the screen have appeared in together.Excellent plot and direction. Mann gives the characters depth and builds the tension and drama. This is the movie where Michael Mann demonstrated the cinematographic style that would be his trademark: the use of colour and light on dark, the beautiful high-resolution night scenes. Visually amazing.Great acting by De Niro and, to a lesser extent, Pacino, but you would expect that. Pacino maybe overdoes the theatrics, though. As an indication of the magnitude of the main stars, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight and Amy Brenneman, major stars in their own right, get fairly secondary roles and Tom Sizemore and Ashley Judd have fairly minor roles. All perform superbly.",9,2,4,21 January 2016

Gritty, making you think about life and death, and dealing with cancer. The ending is a bit too neat and conventional though.Great performance from Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

Turns out vampires have their own domestic problems too...Incredibly original, and very funny. Co-written and co-directed by Jemaine Clement of Flight of the Concords fame, it features understated humour, sharp dialogue and clever skits, similar to Flight of the Concords.While the budget was obviously fairly low, the cheapish production values don't detract from the quality of the movie. If anything, they enhance the movie, as the directors can't rely on fancy CGI but instead have to rely on clever plot and dialogue. It also makes the movie feel much more 'real'.Solid performances all round from a cast whose only known names are Jemaine Clement and Rhys Darby (also of Flight of the Concords fame. Where was Bret McKenzie?).Probably the best vampire movie you'll ever see.",9,0,2,25 July 2015
Deadpool," Outrageously funny, original and entertaining
","Wade Wilson (played by Ryan Reynolds) is a small-time mercenary. He meets Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) and falls in love. Life is idyllic until one day he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Things look bleak but a man appears who says he can be cured, through a treatment that gives him superhero powers. After initially turning him down, Wilson agrees, and meets the man behind the project, Ajax (Ed Skrein). While undergoing the treatment he discovers that it will involve him becoming a mutant, and he will need to undergo several painful tests to discover what his mutant abilities are. Plus, Ajax is a sadist. The treatment results in Wilson getting powers of accelerated healing but also leaves him terribly disfigured. Ajax tries to keep him a prisoner but he escapes. He now has two aims: find Vanessa and make Ajax pay for what he did to him. Killing Ajax may not be as easy it seems, as Ajax is also a mutant and the meddling, do-gooder superhero Collossus and his sidekick Negasonic Teenage Warhead keep getting in the way. Oh, and Wade Wilson is now operating under an alias: Deadpool.After all the all style-no-substance, CGI-driven comic book movies, this movie is a breath of fresh air in the genre. Outrageously funny, original and entertaining. Clever, snappy, laugh-a-minute dialogue. Some great cultural references and in-jokes, especially regarding other comic book movies.Basic but decent plot. Hardly Citizen Kane stuff but at least it has a plot, which is more than one can say for most comic book movies. Decent character depth and engagement.Good action sequences too.This all said, it really is all about the humour and Ryan Reynolds delivers it with aplomb. Good support from TJ Miller in the humour department and Morena Baccarin in the drama, romance and looks departments.Easily the best comic book movie made in a very long time.",8,2,9,27 May 2016
Get Him to the Greek," Disappointing
","Disappointing. Started off incredibly well - screamingly funny, and a good parody of the music industry. Then about halfway through, it just suddenly hit a wall, running out of ideas, and anything funny to say.If the music industry parody could have been maintained at the same level of intensity and humour as in the first half, this would have been a great movie. The edginess just seemed to disappear after a while, plus the writer and director seemed to think the movie was a drama, delving into some rather half-baked takes on relationships.Russell Brand is great in the lead role, playing a character that was tailor-made for his rock star-like personality and appearance. Jonah Hill is weak and irritating as the sidekick. The surprise performance comes from Sean 'Puff Daddy' Combs as the intense record exec. He is amazingly good, and almost steals the show from Russell Brand.Watch the first 40 minutes or so, and save yourself some time by skipping the rest.",5,3,6,25 November 2018
Cloud Atlas," Ambition far beyond its reach or grasp
","Cloud Atlas' ambition far exceeds its coherence, or extent of having a point. Nearly three hours long, set in six time periods, this is really a try-hard movie. Try hard, but fail, that is. Incredibly ambitious, though you often get the feeling that the ambition was to win a Best Makeup Oscar, some of the stars are so well disguised.And well disguised they have to be, as the producers' ambition also seemed to be to see how many different roles they can get out of as few actors as possible. You would think that the obviously large budget of this movie would allow the producers to hire many actors, but instead they have Tom Hanks doing six roles, Halle Berry six (one as a white woman!), Jim Broadbent five, Hugo Weaving six, Jim Sturgess six, Doona Bae six (including one as a white woman, one as a Mexican woman), the list goes on and on. The recycling of actors got very ridiculous, very quickly. It was laugh-out-loud stuff.You could have excused them if there was a link between the different roles of the same actor, but there isn't. (Except for Hugo Weaving, who plays the villain in each scene. Well, that was a given, after The Matrix and, after all, this is directed by the Wachowski siblings).At least when Stanley Kubrick used Peter Sellers in three different roles in Dr Strangelove it was for a good reason: budget (plus, that was Stanley Kubrick and Peter Sellers - you don't argue with cinematic icons like those).This all said, some of the stories are interesting (though none are better than okay). The 1970s nuclear power plant one was probably the pick of the bunch, followed by the 1930s musical composition story, the 22nd century one (even though it borrowed from Soylent Green) and the 19th century one on the ship. The 2012 retirement home one was silly and the Future Vikings Meet Halle Berry Alien was plain pointless, and random.No performances of note, especially as it was incredibly tedious and irritating seeing the same actors appear in every story, in different roles. Just made for confusion between characters.",4,0,4,17 March 2014

What follows is an heroic event of massive historical significance.Had heaps of potential. An historic, 5th century BC, event, told using modern-day graphics. Unfortunately, it quickly degenerates into being a lot less about history and much more about supernatural / fairy-tale crap (monsters etc) and over-the-top repetitive violence, all in slow motion.

","Good action scenes...and that's it.A young man is drawn into applying to be a secret agent with the highly secretive organisation, Kingsman. Meanwhile a multi- billionaire is plotting something massive and catastrophic for mankind, aided by his assistant, Oscar Pistorius in drag.I was hoping for something clever, character-based or with a good plot, or maybe even a James Bond parody. Alas, this is none of those. It is basically a fairly poor ripoff of a James Bond movie: less plot and less humour but more explosions and action scenes. The action does carry it though and there is hardly a dull moment.Overall, reasonably tense and (mindlessly) entertaining but certainly not a must-see.",5,1,5,20 December 2015
Ran," Epic drama
","Epic drama.Set in Japan in the 16th century (or so), an elderly warlord retires, handing over his empire to his three sons. However, he vastly underestimates how the new-found power will corrupt them, or cause them to turn on each other...and him...Directed by famed Japanese director Akira Kurasawa (Seven Samurai, Rashomon, Yojimbo), this is a grand, sweeping tale of family betrayal and lust for power. Based on Shakespeare's King Lear but even if you weren't familiar with that work, you can spot the Shakespearean aspects - the family feud, the Machiavellian power plays, the plots and counter-plots, the tragic twists, often from seemingly arbitrary events.Not perfect though. The story could have been tighter - there are a few sub-plots which don't really add anything to the story and just prolong it unnecessarily. Some plot developments aren't explained very well either. And I could have done without the irritating court jester (more like court cynic) character...",8,0,2,17 October 2015

The Hangover Part III," Trust Hollywood
","Trust Hollywood to take a good movie and wreck it by making mindless, craptacular sequels. The first Hangover movie was good: hilariously funny at times, and more intelligent than your average Hollywood slapstick. It did seem to run out of new ideas and steam at about the 1 hour mark though.That concluding lack of steam and originality carried through to The Hangover II. It was pretty much a copy-and-paste of the first one. Different location, but very similar plot (and, obviously, the same characters). Interesting at times, but mostly fairly predictable and mundane.The Hangover III is even worse. Stupid, pointless, not funny at all. Zach Galifianakis' character, always the worst and most irritating aspect of the Hangover movies (or any movie he is in) is even more irritating than before.Hopefully there is no Part IV.Avoid.",2,1,2,8 July 2014
Green Book," Great movie: may seem predictable in its destination but it's the journey that matters
","1962. A bigoted Italian-American bouncer, Tony Lip, gets the job of driving Dr Don Shirley, renowned African-American pianist, on his tour across the mid-West and South. The two could not be more different.I did not have high expectations for this movie. I knew it would be good, but figured it wouldn't cover any new ground. Moreover, it seemed like a reverse Driving Miss Daisy (not that DMD is a bad movie - quite the opposite - but that it had been done before).I needn't have worried. The outcome is fairly predictable, but that doesn't matter: the getting there is original, interesting, engaging, thought-provoking and great.Director Peter Farrelly sets the scene well and paces the movie to perfection. The characters of Tony Lip and Don Shirley are well drawn and developed, making for high engagement levels. You can see their views and characters evolve before your eyes, see the events that shape them and how these influence their future actions. There's also a decent smattering of humour to aid the engagement.Some great social commentary too, especially on racial attitudes of the day and on tolerance in general.Mahershala Ali got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Don Shirley, and well deserved the award. Great work too from Viggo Mortensen as Tony Lip, resulting in a Best Actor nomination (he ultimately lost out to Rami Malek for Bohemian Rhapsody).The movie itself won the 2019 Best Picture Oscar.Great film.",8,2,5,13 July 2019
John Wick: Chapter 2," Even worse than the first movie
","Picking up where the first movie left off, John Wick still wants his car back. Also, he now discovers that there is a bounty on his head. Rejoining his former profession, he heads to Rome to complete an assassination assignment. The first John Wick was quite disappointing. It started well, with a good build up and backstory. After a while, however, it lost any pretence of character-development, plot- development or intrigue and just becomes a simple action movie. This was unfortunate, as it had some potential in the crime-drama stakes. Even worse, it was action of the perfectly choreographed, first person shooter, high body count, explosions-for-the-sake-of-explosions variety. It got rather monotonous and predictable after a while. I gave it a 5/10.John Wick Chapter 2 dispenses with the luxury of character depth or a plot, or even pretending to have them, and gets straight to the action scenes. They just come in waves. If three minutes have gone by and nothing has exploded, or shots have been fired, or cars chased or someone performed a martial arts move, you know a scene involving at least one of the aforementioned one is due, and it's going to go on and on.Quite mindless, unoriginal, monotonous and boring.",2,2,6,18 March 2018
Jackie Brown," Great follow-up to a masterpiece
","Jackie Brown is a middle-aged airline stewardess who supplements her income by smuggling arms for crime kingpin Ordell Robbie. One day she is caught and the agents offer her a deal in order to apprehend Robbie. Robbie, however, is onto the threat and tries to have Brown eliminated. What follows is a dangerous game of bluff, deceit and betrayal.In 1994, Quentin Tarantino wrote and directed the greatest film ever made, Pulp Fiction. Following up that movie was always going to be a tall order, especially as his previous movie, Reservoir Dogs, was almost as good. There was almost no way his third movie could even come close to those two masterpieces.However, Tarantino gives it a good try.Yes, Jackie Brown is not in the same league as Pulp Fiction, or Reservoir Dogs, but very little is. It is, however, still a great movie. Clever, solid, plot, based on Elmore Leonard's novel 'Rum Punch'. Has the Tarantino trademark complexity and interconnectivity of a few stories and characters and meticulous plot detail, all combined with very witty dialogue and dry dark humour.Excellent performances, with Pam Grier (as Jackie Brown) and Robert Forster to the fore.On the negative side, the plot does feel overly drawn out. The meticulousness slows down the pace of the movie. Also feels overly complex at times, as if some of the twists are there for twist's sake.Still a great movie though.",8,0,1,23 May 2019
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," One of the funniest movies ever made (if not THE funniest)
","England, 932 AD. King Arthur and his loyal squire Patsy are travelling across the land, recruiting knights for Arthur's Round Table. Ultimately, however, King Arthur is on an even more important quest - finding the Holy Grail. To find it he and his knights will have to pit their wits and strength against all manner of foe, including the Black Knight, the Knights who say Ni, the Rabbit of Caerbannog, the Legendary Black Beast of Aaargh, The Bridge-keeper of the Bridge of Death, and some pesky, trash-talking French soldiers who seem to thwart them at every turn.One of the funniest movies ever made (if not THE funniest). Hilariously over-the-top and inane, and the perfect example of the sheer creativity, unconstrained thinking and left-field mentality of Monty Python. Some scenes just have to be seen to be believed, they are so out there. Not just physical humour, the dialogue is brilliant too. Just about every line is eminently quotable. It also includes the most bizarre and original ending to a movie you'll ever see. A true comedy classic.",10,1,2,6 June 2016
Minions," Good fun
","Introduced as the henchmen of Gru in Despicable Me and reappearing alongside Gru in Despicable Me 2, the Minions now get their own movie. We see their history, from prehistoric times to the late- 1960s. Their purpose in life is to serve a despicable, villainous master. After falling foul of their last master, the Minions end up masterless, living in a cave and leading a pointless existence. Then three Minions - Kevin, Stuart and Bob - set out to find the Minions a master.Reasonably good fun. Basic in plot, hardly profound and not exactly laugh-a-minute it is still fairly entertaining. While the humour is sporadic there are some great comedic moments. There's also a sweetness and innocence to the whole thing that is quite delightful.Voice casting is spot-on. Sandra Bullock, as Scarlet Overkill, is the pick of the bunch.Kids are sure to love it and adults should find it enjoyable enough too.",6,0,0,7 May 2016
Aladdin," Entertaining
","Aladdin is a poor yet care-free street urchin in an Arabian city. One day he meets Princess Jasmine, the daughter of the Sultan of the land, and falls madly in love. However, the evil Jafar, the Sultan's sorcerer, imprisons Aladdin and manipulates him into working for him. Unknown to Aladdin, he is the only one who can enter and unlock the treasures of a secret cave, including a magical lamp. Aladdin finds the lamp and releases the genie trapped within. The genie offers to grant him three wishes. Meanwhile, Jafar wants the lamp and the Princess has to be married within three days. Many adventures follow...Reasonably entertaining. Mostly for kids - the plot is pretty linear, fairy tale stuff and the adventures are often quite juvenile - but it is never boring. Quite funny at times and has enough substance to keep adults interested too.Some catchy songs too, just to make it memorable.Robin Williams steals the show as voice of the genie. The role are dialogue are perfect for him, so much so that I suspect he wrote, or even ad-libbed, some of the funnier lines. Not a classic, but worth watching nevertheless.",7,0,1,30 December 2016
Inside Llewyn Davis," It's about the journey, not the destination
","It's about the journey, not the destination. Hard to explain why this movie works, other than that. It appears to be a rambling, pointless film. However, the rambling, almost-cyclical, quite depressing in a way, story has many charms. It is the story of an almost-famous everyman, his trials and tribulations, the almost irrecoverable rut he is in. Fill those adventures with the Coen brothers usual mixture of quirky characters, humour, symbolism, red herrings and character depth, and you have a very engaging story.Great performance by Oscar Isaac in the lead role. Good supporting cast too. Probably the most surprising performance is by Justin Timberlake. Yes, we already knew he could act, but here he is hardly recognisable as an early-60s folk singer. Solid performance.On the subject of musicians, the music is one of the highlights of the movie. Some great tracks, some written just for the movie. Helps if you like early-Bob Dylan/Steeleye Span/Fairport Convention- style folk (and I do), but it is very well done.Subtler than your average Coen brothers movie, but well worth the watch.",8,0,2,17 December 2014

Incredibly original in its combining filmed material and animation (through the use of green screen technology, apparently). Probably the most unique and superbly done movie ever made, in terms of CGI.Superb direction by Michael Rodriguez, assisted by Frank Miller himself, and Quentin Tarantino.Great acting performances by an all-star cast: Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Benicio Del Toro, Rasario Dawson, Jessica Alba,Josh Hartnett, Carla Gugino, Michael Clarke Duncan, Elijah Wood.Slick, gritty, graphic, great.",10,2,3,19 April 2014

In reading from a book they then inadvertently summon a family of zombie killers. However, they've only just scratched the surface of what the cabin is hiding.Pleasantly surprised, but ultimately disappointing. Was expecting your average (i.e. crap) horror movie but for the first 60% or so of the movie it was very interesting. Intriguing, engaging and, most surprising, funny.From a point, however, it degenerates into your usual humans-vs- ghouls/zombies schlock, and from then on it is incredibly formulaic and tiresome.",5,1,2,24 June 2016
Spectre," Entertainment, action and a decent plot
","James Bond hunts and kills a criminal kingpin in Mexico City. It was an unsanctioned kill and the repercussions are swift and dire - Bond is suspended and his movements tracked 24/7 via his blood. However, this won't stop our intrepid hero - he is on the track of a massive criminal syndicate, an organisation whose name he does not know - all he has is a ring with its octopus-like symbol. It transpires that the secrets to the organisation lie with the daughter of a long-time enemy of his, and his own childhood.Entertaining and more substantial than your average Bond movie. Skyfall lifted the bar in terms of plot development and character depth and Spectre picks up where that left off. Not quite as good as Skyfall in terms of originality - Spectre still falls back on many Bond clichés and contrivances.Great action sequences, of course.Solid work by Daniel Craig in the lead role with good support from Christoph Waltz, Ralph Fiennes, Naomi Harris, Lea Seydoux, Ben Whishaw and Andrew Scott.",7,0,2,17 September 2016
Braveheart," One of the worst Best Picture Oscar winners
","One of the worst Best Picture Oscar winners, and surely one of the most over-rated movies of all time. (Not THE worst, that honour definitely goes to the 1931 version of Cimarron). Historically inaccurate anti-English propaganda, with wooden over-the-top-macho-hero acting. The only good part was when Wallace was executed.Plot summary: Mel Gibson sets out to make an anti-English movie, because that was the phase he was going though (The Patriot was even worse), and wins a few Oscars in the process.Also a great example of how clueless the people are who determine the Oscar winners. In a year that brought such fantastic movies as 'Leaving Las Vegas', 'The Usual Suspects', 'Dead Man Walking', 'Twelve Monkeys' and 'Richard III', they gave five Oscars, incl Best Picture and Best Director, to this piece of crap.",4,3,6,7 March 2014

She is divorced with two children, her ex-husband lives in her basement, her mother lives upstairs and just watches soap operas all day, and her father (divorced from her mom for 17 years now) is now also living with her. Joy designs a revolutionary new mop and this leads to all sorts of adventures, good and bad.Dull and unengaging. Rags-to-riches stories are generally quite emotional, engaging and entertaining, as you want the underdog to succeed. Being a true story you also feel you are learning something too. However, Joy just seems flat and uninteresting.The setup was initially interesting: the quirkiness of the situation and characters was quite amusing. However this wore off pretty quickly and the quirkiness became overdone and irritating.The plot development had some interesting moments but most of what happens is just everyday commerce. Director David O Russell tries to make something out of nothing at just about every step in the journey. Many of the setbacks, solutions and general business practices seem ridiculous and unlikely in actual business.All-star cast - Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro, Isabella Rossellini, Virginia Madsen, Dianne Ladd - does well, but they were never the problem. The script and direction are the issues. More broadly, was this even a story worth telling?",4,2,5,11 November 2016

Direction is spot on: great feel and atmosphere, and everything fits well together. Superb performance by Sam Rockwell, but you wouldn't expect anything less than that from him. Interesting that the director is Duncan Jones, son of David Bowie. David Bowie gave us A Space Oddity, the story of a doomed spaceman. Has his son just made the movie version of that song?",8,2,3,21 March 2017
Her," Disappointing
","Disappointing. Original, innovative and thought-provoking, yet dull and pretentious. Initially very good, painting a very depressing and superficial possible future for society (and not just future, it shows up the superficiality of our present too). All done in an imaginative and highly plausible way.Up until about the 40% mark, writer-director Spike Jonze was in top form. Then at a point he just runs out of ideas. From this mark the movie just drifts, drags and goes nowhere. Point made early, the rest feels like padding.Having wandered around aimlessly for about an hour, the ending then feels rushed, and quite obvious and trite.Performances are OK, especially considering what the actors had to work with in the middle and later stages of the movie. Nobody really stands out though.This movie had the potential to be something incredibly profound, but falls short.",5,3,8,23 January 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," Great movie
","Great movie. Very moving, brutal in its portrayal of the poverty the main characters live in, but with humorous moments too. Bitter-sweet. Deserves all the awards and award nominations it is getting.The only negative thing, and the reason it isn't a perfect 10, is the way the movie got fairly formulaic towards the end. I can think of at least one ending which would have been more impactful than the actual one.If you liked this movie, see 'City of God'. Set in Rio de Janeiro, it also examines the lives of people living in abject poverty, and their consequences of their situation. Even better than Slumdog Millionaire, I felt.

The Nice Guys," Incredibly funny
","Los Angeles, 1978. Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) is a private investigator, of sorts. He is the man you call when someone needs to be given a message, violently. Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is more legit, and conventional, taking cases involving tracking down missing persons and the like. Their paths cross when porn star Misty Mountains dies in a car crash. Misty's aunt hires March after she believes that Misty is still alive. Their investigations lead them to a young woman named Amelia, and a massive conspiracy plot. Ostensibly a crime-drama, but far more than that. Very funny, with some very tight, clever dialogue. Some scenes and punch-lines are screamingly funny. Very edgy too - certainly doesn't pull its punches.However, as a drama, it's less good. The crime plot is okay, and was initially very intriguing. However, after a while it falls back on fairly conventional developments and contrivances. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling are great in the lead roles, showing wonderful comedic delivery and timing. 15-year old Angourie Rice almost steals the show as March's daughter and delivers on the promise she showed in These Final Hours. Casting Kim Bassinger opposite Russell Crowe was a masterstroke as the plot does have an LA Confidential sort of vibe.",8,1,2,22 July 2017

Along the way she meets Max Rockatansky...Directed by George Miller, who directed the original Mel Gibson- starring Mad Max in 1979, plus both its sequels, Mad Max: Fury Road is two hours of non-stop action. The plot is rather basic, and there's very little substance to it, but the action is frenetic and constant. However, while this makes it entertaining, it does feel monotonous after a while. There's only so far you can go with an 'all style, no substance' approach.Ultimately reasonably interesting, but vastly overrated.",6,0,4,2 September 2015

We see Doss's trials and tribulations after enlisting in the US Army and trying to become a medic. Finally, we see the hell on Earth that was Hacksaw Ridge.A very powerful story. Shows that bravery and heroism in wartime doesn't necessarily involve fighting, killing or even carrying a weapon. The fact that it is true makes it even more inspirational.Not flawless though. The setup - Doss's childhood, WW2 civilian life and Army training are handled a bit clumsily at times. Certain event sequences feel a touch contrived, or lacking in detail, and some aspects seem TOO detailed. The Army's attempts to get rid of him seem overstated (though that might be just me watching the movie through a 21st century lens).Moreover, there is a sense of predictability and inevitability about it all - you know how it's all going to turn out. You know he will get to Okinawa, and you want the movie to get to that part of his life as soon as possible. By that measurement, the setup was too long.However, the clumsiness and duration of the setup is more than overcome by the intensity and grittiness of the action on Okinawa. I can't think of a longer, more sustained, more intense, piece of war action in cinema. Incredibly realistic, and graphic, with no empty bravado.The scenes at the end close the loop well on what was set out in the first half of the movie.

Characters have no depth, limiting the audience engagement, and the movie feels much like any other other fantasy movie, that is, much style, little substance. Decent cast - Travis Fimmel (of Vikings fame), Paula Patton, Ben Foster, Dominic Cooper - but wasted on this empty movie.

The Runaways," Ruined by Kristen Stewart (no surprises there) and lacklustre direction
","I love rock biopics, but initially avoided this because it starred Kristen Stewart, star of films where no acting, or plot, or character depth are involved. So it was with some trepidation that I eventually watched it, hoping it wasn't all that bad. Sadly, it is. Kristen Stewart is indeed talentless. What could have been an edgy and intriguing look at one of rock's more controversial bands turns into a fairly lacklustre join-the-dots docu-drama. Much of this is the fault of the director, Floria Sigismondi. However, Kristen Stewart's lack of ability to play anything beyond one-dimensional characters doesn't help, especially as she plays the main character, Joan Jett.Stewart is aided and abetted by Michael Shannon, who, as Kim Fowley, tries too hard to be dark, quirky and edgy and comes off as over- acting.Dakota Fanning makes up for this, to a degree, by putting in an excellent performance as Cherie Currie. There are some other pluses: the music is great, of course. The history of The Runaways is covered fairly well.",5,3,5,10 February 2016

Commodus has Maximus wife and child murdered. Maximus escapes before being executed himself, only to be captured and enslaved. He becomes a gladiator and fights to regain his status. Moreover, he is determined to take revenge on Commodus.Pretty much a standard action/revenge movie, set in Roman times. Lots of fight scenes and not much else, including profundity.

","Great movie on the founding and rise of Facebook, and the business machinatians that went on behind the scenes. Focuses primarily on Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, and he doesn't come out looking good.Despite the less-than-flattering portrayal of Zuckerberg, and the room for poetic licence, the movie comes across as objective and factual (and I wouldn't know myself how true it all is). Very believable. Great direction by David Fincher. Pace is intense, and never lets up. No red herrings or unnecessary detours. Camera angles and the like are spot on.Good performances all round. Jesse Eisenberg is very believable as Zuckerberg. Andrew Garfield plays Eduardo Saverin, co-founder, and does a good job. Surprise performance is from Justin Timberlake. Who knew he could act? (His music sucks, so I always knew he was no musician!). Although he has been in a few movies previously, he has never had a major role, and I have always regarded him as appearing in movies to add star appeal, rather than for his acting ability. He is excellent in this, though you feel this is the role he was born to play, as the personality and life of Sean Parker seems very much like that of pop star.No matter how much truth there is in the story, a great movie and definitely worth the watch. Only proviso: if you're one of the few not on Facebook, many of the technical details will go over your head.",9,0,0,6 March 2014
Macbeth," Good adaptation of Shakespeare's famous play
","William Shakespeare's classic tale of ambition, treachery, guilt and revenge. MacBeth, the Thane of Glamis, receives a series of predictions from three witches. One is that he will be Thane of Cawdor and another is that he will be King of Scotland. When he is elevated to Thane of Cawdor he starts to think that their predictions have some merit. Encouraged by Lady MacBeth he murders the current King, Duncan, and is made the new King. This power emboldens him, resulting in a murderous purging of the Kingdom of anyone who may be a threat to him. Meanwhile the opposition forces are beginning to gather...A good adaptation of the classic play. Dark, haunting and reasonably fast-paced - Hardly the recitals that sometimes pass for Shakespeare-based movies. Good production values too.Great work by Michael Fassbender in the lead role. Solid support from Marion Cotillard as Lady MacBeth, Sean HArris as Macduff, PAddy Considine as Banquo and David Thewless as Duncan. Elizabeth Debicki also appears, as Lady Macduff, but does not have much screen time.On the negative side, there is an element of style over substance to the movie.

Great script, based on a true story. Scorsese doesn't put a foot wrong in his direction (not that he ever does!). Acting is superb. Ray Liotta, in one of his earliest roles, is very convincing in the lead role. Joe Pesci deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his intense performance, as did Lorraine Bracco deserve her Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination. Despite getting top billing, Robert De Niro doesn't have the most screen time, but doesn't seem to mind, giving his usual solid performance.A great movie. See it.",10,0,1,19 April 2014
The Great Gatsby," Better than the 1974 version
","Good adaptation of the F Scott Fitzgerald book, and better than the 1974 adaptation. Not great though: too much style instead of substance (which has always been an issue with Baz Luhrmann's movies). The first half was mostly just Luhrmann showing off what he can do with special effects, light, colour and movement. The 21st-century soundtrack in a 1920s setting was particularly irritating.However, the substance kicks-in in the second half, and then the movie becomes interesting. Much less special effects, much more drama. The last few scenes are very emotional, and brilliant.I know this is supposed to be Leonardo DiCaprio's best shot at a Best Leading Actor Oscar, after being snubbed many times, but I don't see him getting it. I wouldn't even have him among the nominees. His performance is OK, but not brilliant. In fact, it is debatable whether he even deserves top billing in the movie. Yes, he plays the character after whom the movie is named, but Tobey Maguire has much more screen time. Maguire puts in a solid performance, in a role which requires him to be solid but not spectacular. He is the narrator, and our eyes into the life of Gatsby and friends, not a man of action. Carey Mulligan shines as Daisy. She is perfect for the role.Good performances from an all-Australian supporting cast: Joel Edgerton, Isla Fisher, Jason Clarke, Jack Thompson and Elizabeth Debicki.",7,0,3,2 March 2014
13 Hours," Surprisingly good
","Libya, 2012. At an unofficial CIA base in Benghazi a group of ex- military contractors are providing security. In the aftermath of Gaddafi's downfall a power vacuum exists and the climate is volatile. Military weapons are freely available. The US Ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, makes a visit to the area, staying in a compound near the CIA base. On the night of 11 September, 2012, the Ambassador's compound is attacked by hordes of heavily armed locals. The only forces willing and able to defend it are six CIA contractors.Before seeing it, I was very skeptical about this movie. It clearly starts at a disadvantage, being directed by Michael Bay, he of the explosion-centric, all style no substance plots. Plus the timing seemed very suspicious, being released in a US election year, with Hillary Clinton running for President and the Benghazi attack being a controversial mark on her record as Secretary of State. So the movie seemed to have a political agenda.Thankfully my fears were unfounded and the movie is surprisingly good and apolitical. Well told, with a good build up, giving the main characters some depth and setting the scene well. When the action starts it is not all unrealistic heroics but fairly plausible battle scenes. There is a degree of overuse of pyrotechnics by Michael Bay, but it wouldn't be a Michael Bay movie without it.Quite compelling viewing, from a point, as the battle gets tenser and tenser and the odds greater.Solid performances too.Easily the best Michael Bay movie, though not that this says much.",7,0,4,23 January 2017
Hustle & Flow," Interesting, engaging movie
","Interesting, engaging movie.A small-time hustler in Memphis, Tennessee reaches a crossroads in his life. Pondering what to do next him and a few friends start to record hip-hop music, written by him, in his house. It's good but will it get them anywhere?Good, engaging plot. There's a grittiness and realness which makes the story so appealing. The characters are hardly perfect people, which makes the whole experience so much more plausible. Solid direction by Craig Brewer (who also wrote the script). I'm not a hip-hop fan but the soundtrack works very well.Terrance Howard is solid in the lead role and gets great support from Taryn Manning, especially, Anthony Andersen, Taraji J Henson and Ludicrous. DJ Qualls is the token white guy in the cast, and is, as almost always, fairly irritating.Worth a watch.",7,0,0,29 July 2015
Warm Bodies," Highly original zombie movie
","Highly original zombie movie. Possibly the most original since the first ever zombie movie. A zombie-romantic-comedy, if you like, which shows how original it is as I doubt any other movie has been described as that.Very interesting, quirky plot. Starts intriguingly and gathers momentum as it goes. Has a few periods when it becomes a bit of a mundane chase and/or action sequences, but these are short. Plot isn't entirely watertight either, but, considering the science-fiction nature and quirkiness of the movie, it can be forgiven for erring on the side of entertainment over flawless plot.Has some funny moments too. The whole premise of the movie is quite funny, in fact.Ending is quite sweet and profound.Good performances from Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer in the lead roles. Solid support from John Malkovich, Rob Corddry and Analeigh Tipton.",8,1,2,19 May 2014
The Birds," Engrossing Hitchcock thriller
","An incredibly engrossing Alfred Hitchcock thriller.Very original plot. Hitchcock probably created the creature-horror movie with this film, yet it is so much more than that. It has romance, human drama and survival.In typical Hitchcock fashion, the tension builds slowly. The background story is interesting in itself. Without the birds, the movie could easily have been turned into a romantic-drama (it probably would have needed a different name though...). Little by little, Hitchcock introduces the protagonists. Also typically Hitchcockian, there is no sound effects to artificially dial up the tension. It is all visual. Some scenes are particularly chilling. The birds behind Tippi Hendren at the school is a good example.Good performances by Rod Taylor and Tippi Hendren in the lead roles. Good support from Jessica Tandy, Suzanne Pleshette and Veronica Cartwright.A classic.",9,4,7,15 June 2014
Sully," Great dramatization of an amazing event
","On 15 January 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 lost both engines shortly after takeoff. Thanks to the experience and skill of its captain, Captain Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger, all 155 passengers and crew survived when the plane landed on the Hudson River. This is the story of that incident, and its aftermath.Great dramatization of an amazing event. While the the events and skill involved therein are pretty incredible I was skeptical that this could be made into an engaging, entertaining movie. I need not have worried. Director Clint Eastwood turns a story that could easily have ended up as a boring linear docudrama into something very interesting. Through starting the movie AFTER the climactic event, the use of back-and-forth time jumps and focusing as much on the aftermath as the event itself, Eastwood has made something very engaging and intriguing.There is a degree of dramatic license involved, especially with regard to the NTSB hearings, but Eastwood and writer Todd Komarnicki needed a way to introduce an element of uncertainty and drama into a story with a known outcome, and that was it.",8,0,0,18 June 2017
Princess Mononoke," Okayish...as a kid's movie
","Okayish...as a kid's movie.Set in a fantasy world, a young man, Ashitaka, is injured defending his village from a giant pig-like demon. The prognosis for his injury is that it will deteriorate and eventually kill him. He can be saved if he finds the cure, which will require a long quest...Pretty much your standard Hayao Miyazaki movie. Good set up, with a fair degree of intrigue. However, the intrigue dissipates quite quickly as the movie degenerates into a long, rambling adventure with no real themes emerging. Add in lack of character depth and thus lack of character engagement and you have: random plot, shallow characters, no profundities - a movie lacking in substance. So, not ideal for intelligent adults.Kid's should enjoy it, though the longish running time may hinder that.",5,7,22,6 March 2016
Beetlejuice," Entertaining
","Entertaining, but fairly hollow. Plot is rather basic, and the humour is sparse.Great over-the-top acting by Michael Keaton though, and Winona Ryder, at age 17 or so and in only her third movie, shines.Good special effects.",7,1,3,23 February 2020
Alien: Covenant," Good, but limited by being a prequel
","It is the year 2104. The spaceship Covenant is headed for a remote planet in order to colonise it. The ship's captain is killed in a freak accident, leaving the Executive Officer in charge. He makes the decision to investigate a nearby planet in order to colonise it, as a possible substitute for their original mission. This has dramatic and far-reaching consequences.The sequel to Prometheus and prequel to the original 1979 Alien. Does not necessarily rely on you having seen Prometheus, as the relevant details from that are provided during the movie. Good background and plot development, with some interesting and intriguing initial twists and turns. Good special effects and solid performances (with the exception of Danny McBride - he looks out of his depth in a drama).However, far from perfect. The David / Walter plot device felt contrived, and was generally confusing.Moreover, if you've seen Alien (as I have), you know how things are ultimately going to end up. So you know that any plot development that indicates a conclusion in a different direction is only temporary. The fact that it is a prequel to another movie severely limits the intrigue and conclusion.",7,0,2,1 October 2017
Draft Day," Entertaining behind-the-scenes look at the NFL
","Entertaining behind-the-scenes look at the NFL.Draft Day focuses on, well, the day of the NFL draft, the behind- the-scenes trading and other deals that take place between the teams. And then the draft itself, of course.How accurate it is and how realistic the deals are, I don't know. However, it makes for intriguing and interesting viewing. Last few scenes are quite intense.Not all good: some characters and scenes seem pointless. The intern, for example, just seems to be there for cheap laughs. Plus the whole Kevin Costner-Jennifer Garner romance thing seemed unnecessary and over-dramatised.Overall: entertaining, even if you aren't into NFL.",7,0,0,9 June 2015
The Soloist," Good but not great
","Steve Lopez is a journalist for the LA Times. He is on the lookout for new story ideas when he stumbles across Nathaniel Ayers, a homeless man with extraordinary musical talents. Lopez is eager to improve Ayers's situation, while writing a story on him, but the biggest problem may be Ayers himself.Good but not great. Emotional journey, but somehow something is lacking. I just didn't feel as engaged as I normally would for a story like this. Maybe it was that it seemed to drift in the middle section or that it ultimately didn't have a point, or, at least, it's point was wasn't strongly put.Can't fault the acting - Robert Downey Jr, Jamie Foxx and Catherine Keener are excellent.",7,1,1,9 December 2017
The Martian," Fascinating and enthralling tale of resourcefulness, ingenuity and survival
","Fascinating and enthralling tale of resourcefulness, ingenuity and survival.After a massive storm forces his crew to leave the planet, an astronaut, Mark Watney (played by Matt Damon), is marooned on Mars, and presumed dead. Figuring that it would be at least four years until someone can rescue him, he sets out, though often ingenious means, to survive..A very well thought-out and made movie from director Ridley Scott. Engrossing, engaging plot - the odds are against our hero, and you feel his plight, yet he finds ways to keep going. The resourcefulness stretches beyond a single man though, to the NASA, and other, people on the ground trying to get him home. This engenders a great feeling of a community of specialists working together.While I can't validate the science in the movie (I'll leave that to Neil deGrasse Tyson!), the science FEELS right - there are no obvious plot holes or inaccuracies. Good performances all round, especially from Matt Damon in the lead role. Only sour note is Sean Bean's character, which came across as cartoonish.A must-see.",9,7,10,12 February 2016
The Fighter," Great movie
","Great movie, and I'm not into boxing. Good human drama, though the rise-to-the-top-against-the-odds boxing story has been done before, many times.Solid direction from David O Russell.The movie is driven by the performances though. Christian Bale deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar. It is debatable whether he was the lead or supporting actor, though. He has more dialogue and screen time (ignoring the fight scenes) than Mark Wahlberg, and generally carries the movie. Not that Mark Wahlberg's performance was poor, it was just understated, and intentionally so.Melissa Leo is solid as the mother, but I am not sure she deserved the Best Supporting Actress Oscar. Especially as Amy Adams gives a better performance, I believe (and was nominated for the same Oscar).All this is aided by a superb, rockin' soundtrack - Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, Ben Harper, among others. Considering how Led Zeppelin never allow their songs to be used in movies ('Kashmir' in 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High' is the only other exception I can think of), the use of 'Good Times, Bad Times' was quite a coup.",9,0,2,6 March 2014
Evil Dead II," So bad it's almost good. Almost.
","So bad it's almost good. Almost.I'm generally not a fan of zombie movies. They're generally quite unoriginal, predictable and one-dimensional. The central plots hardly vary, the actions scenes could just be cut-and-pasted from one movie to the next. Evil Dead II isn't an exception in those regards. What's worse, its special effects and production values are incredibly bad: obvious dolls as zombies, toy bridge and car for the early bridge scene, special effects which hardly look real for a moment.Add in some pretty bad acting and you should have an horrendously bad movie. However, it almost works.The amateurish nature of the production gives the movie a lightness and unintentional humour that keep you entertained. Plus there are some intentional funny moments. The movie could just as well be labeled a comedy as a zombie movie.Unfortunately, the humour doesn't quite negate the pitiful other aspects of the movie. The last few scenes involve the usual zombie vs human and supernatural crap and the movie ends in chaotic fashion.Good for a few laughs though.",5,1,3,22 January 2015
Law Abiding Citizen," Weak
","Lame, contrived and implausible. Vigilante movies are squarely aimed at the lowest common denominator, and this is certainly no different. Exception here is that instead of a straight find 'em-and-kill 'em story, the plot gets more and more unnecessarily convoluted and bizarre the further you go on. Eventually the plot twists get predictable, and tedious.The other problem is that in the end it is the justice system that is painted to be the problem, not the misguided villain. You are normally meant to sympathise with and support the vigilante, here, no matter what brought him to this situation, he is beyond sympathy.Dead giveaway that this is a pile of excrement is the presence of Gerard Butler. He is a one-dimensional action actor and can't do an American accent.Jamie Foxx is better than this, as his Oscar win and another nomination attest to. His choice in movies needs to be better though. Despite his clear acting talent, he is fairly unconvincing, and even irritating, here.Good supporting cast - Colm Meaney, Bruce McGill, Leslie Bibb - are wasted.Only plusses are that it has a fair degree of intrigue, the action sequences are well done, and the movie is reasonably short.",3,1,2,20 December 2019
From Here to Eternity," Every bit the classic it is made out to be

All their stories will come to a head on 7 December when they will be first hand witnesses to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.Every bit the classic it is made out to be. Good script, containing many plots and sub-plots, running in parallel, culminating in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Solid direction from Fred Zinnemann.Superb performances by a great cast: Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, Deborah Kerr, Donna Reed and Frank Sinatra - all five of them got Oscar nominations with Reed winning Best Supporting Actress and Sinatra Best Supporting Actor. The cast also includes early-career appearances by Jack Warden and Ernest Borgnine.The movie itself won the 1954 Best Picture Oscar and director Fred Zinnemann won Best Director. It finished with a total of 8 wins and another 5 nominations.",9,2,3,30 January 2017
The Island," Michael Bay with less explosions and slightly more plot
","Set in a dystopian future, a group of people work in a facility, essentially as slaves. They do have an incentive though - a regular lottery is held and one of them gets to leave the facility and its restrictions and move to The Island, a paradise. Lincoln Six Zero is one of the workers in the facility and he is infatuated with Jordan Two Delta. His life is fairly uneventful and mundane until Jordan Two Delta gets selected to go to The Island. Then Lincoln starts to discover the truth about the facility and The Island.Despite being a Michael Bay movie, this film looked promising. It was never that original - Logan's Run sprang immediately to mind just from the summary and the first few scenes - but had potential to at least go somewhere different.However, very quickly the wheels fell off. While still having more substance than Bay's average movie, the plot was still lacking. Despite the 2 ¼ hour running time of the movie, the plot is fairly basic, just with a few hidden details to make it more interesting. Much of the film is filled with chase and action scenes, so Bay playing to his strengths. A bit less explosions than normal though, which is a plus, I guess.So ultimately your average action-thriller.",5,4,6,12 November 2018
Furious 7," A movie for morons
","Plot: cars, cars falling out of aircraft, cars ramping between skyscrapers, bullet-proof cars, car races, fights, explosions. Pretty much all manner of random stuff involving cars, plus, to a much smaller extent, other stuff, with no real link between one scene and the next.As you can tell, there is really nothing plausible or even good about this movie. Just random action scenes, generally involving cars, strung together. Absolutely nothing makes sense, or even tries to make sense - the plot is that non-existent.Hammy acting to go with the lack of plot and torrent of ridiculous action scenes. Not that surprising, considering the cast. Kurt Russell is capable of a lot better though.Clearly made for people who just need explosions and fast cars to be entertained. Even a plot would be too much of a stretch for their brains. The producers must be laughing all the way to the bank - easiest money they ever made.",1,20,78,1 March 2016
The Godfather," A genre-defining masterpiece
","New York, 1945. Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando) is the aging Godfather of a mafia family. He has three sons - Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino). Sonny is his natural successor but is impulsive, short-tempered and not much of a thinker. Fredo is overly passive. Michael is a war hero and looking to stay out of the family business. The Corleone family and the other four mafia families of New York and New Jersey have been at peace for several years now. Then one of the families decides to get into the illegal narcotics business and wants Don Corleone's help. Don Corleone decides that his family should stay out of narcotics. This has disastrous and far-reaching consequences, consequences that will suck Michael deeper and deeper into the family business. Hard to come up with any more superlatives for this movie, as it is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. Great story, based on the book by Mario Puzo and adapted by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. Superb direction by Coppola - some wonderful moments of sensitivity and great drama scenes. Despite being nearly three hours long it doesn't feel like it at all. The movie is very well paced and there's always something happening. Coppola sucks you in from the word go and keeps you enthralled and engaged the whole time.Excellent performances too. Marlon Brando well deserved his Best Actor Oscar, as did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan their nominations for Best Supporting Actor. The movie launched Pacino's career and revitalised Brando's. Beyond the pure art and entertainment of the movie, it defined, and set the benchmark for, the gangster-drama. There had been gritty crime-dramas before. In the 1930s and 40s we had several excellent James Cagney movies (White Heat from 1949 being the pick of the bunch), as well as the original Scarface and other crime dramas. In the 1940s and 50s there were some great film noir dramas. However, none of these had the grittiness, profundity and sheer breadth and depth of story of The Godfather. So monumental its influence can be seen in the works of Scorsese (Goodfellas, especially), Tarantino, many other directors and, most overtly, the excellent TV series The Sopranos. An all-time classic.",10,6,9,20 December 2015
