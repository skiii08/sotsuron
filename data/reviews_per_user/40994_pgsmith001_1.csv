The Devil's Advocate," John Milton
","Most of you probably already know, but I just thought I'd point this out - John Milton, the infamous English author, wrote Paradise Lost, a book predominately dealing with Satan.  Most of our depictions and perspectives of Hell and Satan directly originate from Milton's work. Al Pacino's name in the movie is a literary allusion and perhaps a tribute to John Milton's influence on our satanic views.",Null,0,1,12 April 2003
