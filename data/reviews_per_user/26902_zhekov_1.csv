Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Can't understand why people find it boring
","Albeit I like vol.1 more (which is normal, for a fan of Shogun Assassin), comments like 'why so many pointless dialogs' or 'she wrote a list, but failed to kill everyone' surprise me. You know what, in life we often talk, not because we have to, not because it's important, but just like that. And we don't always keep our promises - the things happen in an unexpected way, or we reconsider at some point, or simply don't care to.You know what I find really boring? The hour-and-half Hollywood movies, in which people speak what they are supposed to, do what are supposed to do, and everything is predictable from the first five-or-so minutes. It's refreshing to see a movie in which the heroine can take a break and simply talk to somebody. Makes her alive, I suppose... more vital than Black Knight or V.Oh, and there isn't a finale grande, with a long sword fight. So what? Honestly, if I was to write The End, she wouldn't even kill Bill, just take her daughter and go away. Maybe even sue for the house or moral injuries :) (or whatever you call it in US).",9,0,2,25 December 2008
