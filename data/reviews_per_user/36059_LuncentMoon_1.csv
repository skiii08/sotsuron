Your Name.," It is a shame that this movie REALLY could be better
","I have high hopes for this movie since all over the internet was saying that is good. Even metascore has a high rating for it. But it just go to a way in what I am not expecting.The progress in the early scene was good. I have a curiosity about where this film goes to and keep asking 'what is this all about?' 'There must be something incredible that made the two of it switching body'. The comedy and the life in the early scene was also good an I enjoy it so far.And when it comes to the story coming in the middle scene, the girl started to cry. This is where I am really disappointed since there are too little progressing for the girl. This scene what I called 'The Sudden Love BS' which there is not enough progressing to fall in love. Yeah I realized this is a movie so there is a limit amount of time, but oh come on. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the tradition showed in the Itonomori (CMIIW).Other than 'The Sudden Love BS', it's good. But, IMHO, it is REALLY CAN BE WAY BETTER if this movie is made in a series format since there would be more progressing, more background, and therefore, would resulted a powerful ending too. I gave it 7/10, but I really disappointed with this kind of movie since this is a wasted potential movie (really, it is really could be thousand times better if only there is more progressing in the story).",7,4,13,9 December 2016
