"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Simon Pegg is in yet another funny film
","I've seen Simon Pegg in his other British comedies, and all of them were funny. This movie is no exception. While not the best comedy I've seen this year, it was certainly in the top 5.Pegg, plays Dennis, an overweight mall security guard that left his pregnant fianc√© at the wedding alter. His finance, Libby, played by the beautiful Thandie Newton, has moved on in the past 5 years and has a new boyfriend, Whit. Now, the main thing you have to get past is that a guy, like Dennis, whom really doesn't have that many options, would leave a hot girl like Thandie Newton. Once you get over this, it makes the film a lot better.Dennis would still like to get back together with Libby and his son. He decides to compete with Whit and enter a running marathon. Of course, he is in no shape to run, but is determined to try to work out and get better. Will he be able to complete the race before Whit? Some of the funny scenes include, Dennis in little running shorts, Dennis and Whit in the locker room, Gordon below the waist, Dennis chasing the trany at the mall, his jock itch, etc... It made me laugh out loud a lot.FINAL VERDICT: If you have seen any other of Simon Pegg's films and liked them, I'm sure you will like this too.",7,0,1,27 April 2009
The King's Speech," good acting but a boring story
","This movie was OK, but I certainly would not have given it any awards for best movie. But I do think Colin Firth and Geoferry Rush deserved acting awards. I'm surprised Rush didn't win the awards too instead of just being nominated. I just don't get why a movie about a guy getting coached by an actor to learn to speak better is such a great idea. The movie was more like a TV movie because such little happened.I mean, the exciting scene of the film is when Bertie starts cursing while practicing his speech. Then the dramatic last scene is Bertie and his coach in a room reading a speech. Can the excitement please stop!FINAL VERDICT: It's OK, but I wouldn't recommend it for someone whom loves action films.",7,2,5,12 January 2012
The Benchwarmers," If you think a movie about grown adults acting stupid is funny...
","then this movie is for you. Three grown nerds decided to get back at the bullies from their childhood by participating in a baseball tournament with other kids and jocks. The winner gets a new stadium dedicated to them, being built by super rich nerd, Mel. Of course, being adults, the 3 nerds can hit better than the kids. Heder plays the most memorable character, Clark, who has serious IQ problems. There are a few funny scenes, but this movie is still pretty silly. There are also some surprising cameos. Reggie Jackson is in this as well as a couple of retired NFL players. Craig Kilborn even has a role as a grown up bully.Best scene was the baseball player with his birth certificate saying he was 12. Funny.FINAL VERDICT: If you like silly films with not much plot, then you should like this.",3,5,9,10 February 2007
Moneyball," a different kind of sports movie
","Going in, I knew this wasn't the typical sports movie, and I thought I probably wouldn't like it that much, but it turned out to be a good movie and a neat idea. Instead of focusing on the baseball team, the film focuses on those that build the team, specifically the GM, Billy Beane, played by Brad Pitt. It's one of Pitt's better roles.Beane enlists the aid of Ivy League graduate, Peter Brand, in picking ball players. There budget is small compared to other teams, so they look for players that are good at getting on base, and other teams undervalue, ie...won't have to pay them much. Through using a whole new idea to build a team, they are eventually proved successful.I'm surprised this movie didn't win the Oscar for screenplay, It deserved it. As for the acting, it was OK, but I didn't think Pitt or Hill were anything special and really didn't deserve any nominations. Especially Hill, whose role is to play a nerdy, computer geek, with hardly any emotion and a monotone voice. I don't think that says Oscar.FINAL VERDICT: A new type of sports movie. Definitely check it out.",7,1,1,20 April 2012
Whip It," i give it 4 stars because of ellen page...
","whom is great, but otherwise, I didn't really care for the film. I mainly didn't like it because I care nothing about roller derby. I don't know anything about and don't care too. If it had been about something I liked more, like ice skating for example, I think I would have liked the movie a lot more.Page plays, Bliss, a teen whom enters pageants because of her mom. One day she sneaks off to a roller derby match and tries out for a team. Of course, she turns out to be one of the faster skaters and becomes a star in the league. Only problem is she's not old enough to participate and she's lying to her parents. Then a dull love story is thrown in. And since I guess this was a feel good movie, everything works out for Bliss in the end.FINAL VERDICT: I'm sure a lot of people will like this, but it wasn't for me. I hope to see Page in more films in the future.",4,4,10,22 August 2010
The Avengers," better story than expected
","I was fully expecting to not like this movie because I haven't thought much of Iron Man or Captain America movies, but the story behind this film was better than I expected. Also, you need to have seen previous superhero movies to get this movie, especially Thor. Loki, Thor's evil brother, comes to earth to lead an alien invasion and it's up to the superheros to stop him. The Black Widow and Hawkeye have very little to do and could have been left out. So basically, the heroes are chasing Loki around until the invasion when there is a huge battle at the end. The battle was cool with cool computer effects. This is when the Hulk gets to play his big part. But the main heroes in the film were Thor and Ironman, and Captain America gets to make a few decisions too.FINAL VERDICT: OK action flick, but you need to know about the previous superhero movies to get this one.",6,2,6,25 March 2013
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," repeats too much from the first film
","I really liked the first film, but the newness has worn off this time around. It's the same concept except this time Ben Gates must prove his great grandfather had nothing to do with the assassination of Lincoln and instead knew the where abouts of another secret treasure, the city of gold. All the characters from last year are involved with the addition of Gates' mother. They look for clues in Europe, Washington DC, and Mount Rushmore. Ed Harris plays the bad guy who wants the treasure for himself. As to how they get from London to Mount Rushmore, they follow clues, exactly like the first film. And the comedy was very lackluster. A few of the comedic scenes worked, but many didn't.FINAL VERDICT: Just not as enjoyable as the first one. The same plot points are used and little creativity is seen.",4,4,9,28 December 2007
Angels & Demons," entertaining plot, made sense
","I thought this was an entertaining movie, even if the whole antimatter plot point was a little absurd. The Vatican brings back symbolist Robert Langdom at a time of crisis. The pope has just died and the 4 cardinals that were the leading candidates to take his place have been kidnapped. An ancient society called the Illuminati has threatened to kill 1 cardinal every hour starting at 8 and they have stolen the antimatter and hid it in Vatican City and it is due to explode before midnight. As in the Di Vinci Code, Langdom uses clues associated with the various churches in Rome to find out where each cardinal will be executed. Langdom and the police run all over Rome being just a little to late to save the first 3 cardinals lives.Then there is a twist with the bad guy being one of those closest to the pope. What I don't get is why did he hide the antimatter where he was because if Langdon hadn't figured out in time where it was, he would have been blown up too. And are we supposed to believe he had the whole save the day with the helicopter carefully planned out from the beginning.FINAL VERDICT: It's actually a movie that has a plot. It's good enough to keep your interest till the end.",7,0,1,29 March 2010
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," less action than volume 1
","I think volume 1 was better because volume 2 dragged in bits and wasn't as entertaining. Volume 2 starts off slow as we see what happened between the Bride and Bill before the massacre at the church. We have a good fight scene between the Bride and Elle but it leaves the ending up in the air. Then there's Bud, who 'disposes' of the Bride, which brings about the flashbacks of her training. She gets out of the coffin after being buried alive. Now that'a neat trick. But she doesn't get to take care of Bud, someone else does. Then the final act shows the Bride tracking down Bill and meeting her daughter. The two talk, but she's there to get revenge, so it can end in only one way. The final confrontation isn't that eventful. It's anti-climatic.I guess my favorite scenes involved the training of Beatrix by Master Pai Mai. How many times was he going to flick his beard.FINAL VERDICT: Definitely see it if you've seen volume 1. I would have liked it better if it had more fights like volume 1.",7,0,1,21 February 2005
Black Swan," not sure what all the fuss was about
","I finally saw this movie well after Natalie Portman won the Oscar and I don't get why she won. I didn't think this movie or her role were that great. Not really a whole lot even happens. We are left wondering is Nina going crazy. What I assumed from the ending was that the pressure just got to her and started to believe her life was like the white swan she was playing. Where in the end, the swan commits suicide. But I still don't get all the weird visions in the mirror and her 'killing a fellow dancer'; which wasn't real. And her dance instructor was just creepy. And what about Beth, the washed up dancer. Was any of her getting hit by a car real. Did Nina really hurt her in the hospital or just herself. Too many unanswered questions for me.FINAL VERDICT: Does not live up to the hype, skip it.",Null,1,1,12 November 2011
Changeling," more about police corruption than an abduction
","I thought this movie would be more of a thriller about a woman trying to find her missing child after claiming the child found by the police wasn't her son. But, actually this movie is more about the LAPD police corruption. LAPD tries to hide any mistakes made by them. If someone says they are wrong, they have a habit of having them incarcerated in a mental ward. That is what happens to Chirstine Collins after she claims the child returned to her is not her son. She has all this proof her son's dentist to teacher to the fact he is 3 inches shorter than her son. Yet the police won't admit that the boy is not her son, instead they say she is confused and crazy.Chirstine finally has some info about her son when a boy admits that a man and him were involved in the kidnapping and killing of young boys. He points out a picture of Christine's son. The guy is finally found and the last part shows Christine going to two trials: one of the LAPD and the other of a child killer.The acting was pretty good in this. However, the movie could have been shorter. Because it was so long, it seemed to be void of a lot of action.FINAL VERDICT: OK, but too long. It wasn't really a mystery more about corruption. I don't think it was good enough to recommend.",5,0,9,9 September 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Johnny Depp brings a little bit back to a falling franchise
","I didn't like the 2 and 3 sequel to POTC, but I thought this one was a lot better. It wasn't as boring, the story made more sense, and it seemed to be a little shorter. I wasn't expecting much since I hated the third sequel, but like I said, I thought this one was OK.Jack is in London hearing rumors that an impostor is lining up a crew. The impostor is his ex girl, Angelica, the daughter of black beard. The next thing you know, they are on a ship and after the Fountain of Youth. And so is the Spanish and Barbossa. Blackbeard is played by the perfect villain in Ian Mcshane. He almost always plays the bad guy. There are mermaids thrown in, a religious missionary, funny scenes of Jack using coconut trees to corral the Spanish, and a decent ending.FINAL VERDICT: I loved the first POTC and this is the first sequel I can recommend. I thought it was decent, not as boring nor as long.",6,0,0,11 March 2012
Men in Black 3," written for a 12 year old
","I think this movie was written for kids. It's too silly for adults to enjoy. The aliens are so silly in this,ie the big fish at the restaurant, and the jokes seemed to be geared for kids. And there is a sentimental lesson learned in the end.Agents J and K are back and J must go back in time to save K from an alien, which in turn, saves Earth. J teams up with a young K, whom has the same characteristics. Josh Brolin pulls off Tommy Lee Jones' accent perfectly. Also, J leans what great, sentimental thing K did for him when he was a kid.FINAL VERDICT: Make it a movie night for teens.",3,3,7,22 March 2013
The New World," a snail's pace...
","That's how fast this film moves. It was boring from the beginning. Now I know why it was such a bomb at the theater. About 45 minutes needed to be edited out. And there were some parts that seemed impossible. Like how did Pocohantus learn perfect English so fast and how did her hair always look perfect. Did Indians have hair brushes in the 1600s? And I think her tribe would never let her be along with the new white man when Smith was living with them. And why would she fall for Smith. I would think it would have been forbidden in the tribe.As others have commented, the scenery was beautiful, but there were just too many shots of a field or trees that lasted too long and there were too many scenes without dialogue. This movie needs major editing work. And I didn't get why Smith left to go back to England and not ask Pocohantus to come along.FINAL VERDICT: A long movie that basically goes no where. It's only worth watching if you are looking to fall asleep.",Null,0,5,11 January 2007
Walk the Line," Good music, good acting, but....
","it felt like a CBS Sunday night movie. Johnny Cash is interesting, but not a whole lot happens besides his drug/alcohol addiction. It just seemed like one of those Hallmark TV movies. I thought Phoenix did a better acting job than Reese. Reese was good but I don't think she deserved all the acting awards. The role didn't have an oomph to it. It didn't require a lot of emotions. But she can sing the country well. But her really southern accent was a little too thick and annoying. It sounded fake.FINAL VERDICT: Good, but not best picture material. Best part was the music.",7,2,3,7 October 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," offensively funny
","I have to admit this movie had me LOL a lot. It's so wrong but yet so funny. Before even coming to America Borat describes the 'running of the Jew' in his home town. We see these ridiculous goblin looking costumes. You have to admit that was funny; it's not right, but it is funny. Borat comes to America and basically offends everyone. He says women's brains are small, he insults the national anthem. He brings a hooker as a date in a conservative southern home. He even hangs with some homeys in Atlanta. It was pretty good when he tries to check into that hotel in Atlanta. The guy immediately goes gets security.Last of all, the naked wrestling. Need I say more, or should I say 'see' more.FINAL VERDICT: This is a comedy, satire, it's not meant to be mean spirited. Enjoy it for what it is.",7,0,1,17 October 2007
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," plain silly
","I didn't care for this movie; it was a hodge podge of a mess. The plot makes little sense. It's basically to get Holmes and Watson and a gypsy on an adventure to foreign lands. All I know is it had something to do with this guy Moriarty and him having all these big weapons. And Watson ditches his wife right after being married to go along with the manic Holmes, so silly. And what was it with Holmes seeing a fight scene before it happened. I guess it was supposed to be his incredible mind at work but it made him seem like a psychic. And they used slow-mo in all this.FINAL VERDICT: waste of money and time",3,2,4,13 January 2013
The Incredible Hulk," Better story than Ang Lee's hulk, but Lee's film...
","had the better actors with Eric Bana, Jennifer Connley, and Sam Elliott. I liked all 3 actors better than the ones in the new Hulk version. But, this new Hulk overall was a little better; the story flowed better.The film begins with Bruce Banner living in Brazil in hiding working at a bottling plant. Some of his blood lands in a bottle and the General is able to track him there. The General has enlisted the help of aging soldier, Emil Blonsky (whom was great played by Tim Roth) to capture Banner. Of course, Banner gets angry and we get the first glimpse of Hulk. Blonsky is in awe of the Hulk's power and wants the same.Banner makes his way to Virginia to see Betty. Meanwhile, General Ross decides to allow Blonsky to be injected with a serum similar to what Banner had, giving him super power. Ross is tipped to Banner's where abouts and this is the first encounter with Hulk and a vamped up Blonsky. Blonskly proves he can take a licking and keep on ticking. This encounter also offers some great special effects.Hulk gets away with Betty, and the two are on a mission to seek out Mr. Blue who maybe able to reverse the effects of the gamma radiation. Ross finds Mr. Blue and so does Blonsky who insists he be given a dose of Banner's blood.The end of the movie is a cool fight between Hulk and Blonsky's version of the Hulk. Good special effects.FINAL VERDICT: While not the best comic movie to come out, this one was pretty good. I wanted to see it in the theater last year, but didn't. After seeing it, I think that was a good choice because it's not worth 10 dollars to see. It's a good action, popcorn flick, but definitely lacks some of the humor in the Spiderman films.",7,0,2,11 May 2009
Miracle," I don't like hockey, but this was a good movie
","I was too young to have known anything about this game when it was played in real life, but it was definitely more than a game. It concerned world politics and the cold war. The movie did a good job showing how seemingly impossible it seemed for the young American team to beat the best team in the world who had been playing together for 10 years. And Kurt Russell did a good job as the tough coach who was hard on the players to get the most out of them. I also liked the way the hockey games were filmed. I think hockey is the most boring sport and I don't know any of the rules, but the way it was filmed let the least knowlegdable person follow what was going on.FINAL VERDICT: If you like sports movies, then don't miss this one.",Null,47,61,29 November 2004
Mission: Impossible III," better than the second sequel
","This movie was decent when compared to most action films made today. At least the plot made sense and you could follow it. While the stunts and cool gadgets were on the 'wild' side, it wasn't too ridiculous. The movie to me was still enjoyable, even with the sneaking into the Vatican, the swinging from one skyscraper to another. It wasn't completely outlandish.I wish Owen Davian had been shown to be a little more evil. It would have helped with the audience desire to see Ethan Hunt beat him at his own game. Also Hunt's side kicks needed to be developed more and been more involved with the action.And I can't believe how little Kerri Russell was in this film considering when it was in theaters, she was out promoting it like she was the top female lead.FINAL VERDICT: I think it is worth watching if you are looking for an action film.",6,0,0,10 May 2007
Lucky Number Slevin," confusing in the beginning but all makes sense at the end
","This is one of those films that is reminiscent of a Tartino film. The movie starts in the middle and we see the beginning in flashbacks toward the end of the film, and it all comes together. I thought it was a very clever plot.The Boss and the Rabbi (2 Mafia type heads) send guys to pick up a guy named Nick Fisher. They go to his apartment and a guy is there but says he is not Nick, but his name is Slevin. He conveniently was mugged and has no ID. The hot neighbor, Lindsey, comes over and Slevin tells her he is a friend of Nick's and Nick asked him to meet him there.So, Slevin talks to the Rabbi and the Boss and they want him to do something to harm the other because they are enemies. Later on we meet Mr. Goodkat whom is an killer, but who is he working for. Soon, we learn Slevin's true identity and his connection to Mr. Goodkat and why he wanted to meet the Rabbi and the Boss. It all comes together nicely.FINAL VERDICT: Great, I'm surprised I never heard of this movie before I saw it on cable.",7,1,2,28 January 2008
Captain Phillips," better than expected
","Since this was based on a true story, I didn't think it would be that great since you already know what happens. But, it was better than I expected. The writers made the movie thrilling and intense. The pirates first try to board the boat but are successfully driving away. This part was entertaining. Then the pirates make a second attempt and manage to board. Captain Phillips manages to keep most of the crew safe and is double crossed on a deal. Then it is him that the navy and US Seals must rescue. I also thought the dialog between the pirates was done well. It seemed legit with the arguing but they had to throw in the one crazy one that just wants to kill. That was so Hollywood. The last 15 minutes was intense and that is all I will say.FINAL VERDICT: A good movie, check it out.",7,1,2,15 May 2014
Sucker Punch," crazy special effects and story
","This movie didn't make a whole lot of sense. I still don't get was there really a nightclub at the insane asylum or was that part of her imagination too. Was Blue a hospital worker or really the boss running the nightclub? The story is about a young girl, Babydoll, whom accidentally kills her sister, and is sent to a psych ward by her mean stepdad. There she teams up with a few other girls to escape. Then there is the nightclub where the girls are forced to dance, which I don't know if that was real. And Babydoll dances, which we never see, leads to an imaginary world where the girls are jumping out of helicopters and fighting zombie soldiers while obtaining objects they need for their escape. All the special effects were over the top and made the whole movie seem more for a 13 year old.FINAL VERDICT: Too many plot holes, skip it.",3,0,6,10 January 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," why was the final book made into two movies....
","hardly anything happens in this. So much of the honeymoon could have been shortened to make the final book one movie. Of course, I know it was for the mighty dollar, but can the people whom make these movies at least try to put out a good product.The first 40 minutes is the wedding and Jacob upset about it. Then the next third is Bella and Edward on their honeymoon in Brazil and the unnatural fetus. Then the last third is them back home and Bella is very sickly because the baby is killing her. And the wolves want the baby dead because it could be a danger to them. But they can't kill Bella while she is still human. And Jacob decides he would rather turn on his kind and do what he can to protect Bella.And this is all the happens besides the very end where we have the birth. The whole book could have been made in a 2 and half hour movie with the birth happening half way through.FINAL VERDICT: I just don't get the popularity of these movies. I haven't thought any of them are very good. I haven't read the books either. They must be a whole lot better. Well if you have devoted time to watch the other Twilight movies, then you might as well as see this one and final.",5,2,3,14 January 2013
3:10 to Yuma," good story driven by 2 good lead actors
","This movie was pretty good. I wouldn't call it a typical western; it was more about the relationship between cattle rancher, Dan, and outlaw, Ben Wade. Christian Bale and Russell Crowe are both good in this and what make the movie better than average. I liked the way they made Ben seem like this cold blooded killer, but for some reason he had some respect for Dan. Maybe he envied Dan for what he had.There were a few things I didn't quite get. Like, why did Ben Wade just let himself be captured? Was he tired of running or was it because he liked a challenge? Maybe he wanted to escape from Yuma a third time. And at the end, why did he decide to try to help Dan succeed in getting him on the train. Did he really not want his gang to rescue him? And why was his gang just shooting randomly when trying to save Ben. They could have just as easily shot him.FINAL VERDICT: I suggest watching it if you like Bale or Crowe. But I'm sure some will find this movie boring. I didn't.",7,0,1,15 March 2009
The Equalizer," Denzel is a bad mf in this
","Well, Liam Neeson must have been busy so the producers got Denzel Washington to take the lead. This character is exactly what Neeson has been playing in his recent movies like Taken. I guess now that Denzel is over 60, he wants to become an action star like Neeson.In this film, quite, mild mannered Robert McCall, whom works at a Home Depot type of store, befriends a young hooker. Well the Russian mob beats her up and he's mad. First he tries to buy her freedom, but when that fails, we find out exactly what kind of a guy McCall really is. Pretty good scene as to how he takes care of the gangsters.Well the head of the mob is losing money, so he sends his ace guy to find out whom killed his guys. The guy tracks down McCall and he's not prepared for whom he's up against. McCall visits some old friends to find out whom these mob guys are and then it's on. McCall uses his 'skills' to take care of the bad guys in some pretty cool ways, never using a gun.FINAL VERDICT: Fun, over the top, action flick. If you are tired of shoot outs, check this movie out.",7,0,1,2 June 2015
Ali," why wasn't this movie under 2 hours
","The pacing and editing of this movie is horrible.  From the beginning, where it takes forever to see the first fight of the film, why wasn't all this cut out.  The first half hour is so boring that it loses your attention, and it only goes downhill from there.  From this movie, it makes Ali seem like such a hipocrit for being this  really religious guy, but yet he's always cheating on his wives and swearing. I'm sure this movie left a lot out about Ali's life, but I don't think it left him looking like a champ.  Will Smith had a good acting performance, but that is the only good thing to say about this movie.
FINAL VERDICT: Boring; too long. This should have been some 10 episode series on HBO in order to really show Ali's life.  Not worth watching; I'm sure an Ali biography show would be better.",Null,1,1,9 December 2002
The Expendables 2," this is the movie to watch people blow stuff up
","For such a cheesy, straight forward action flick, this is actually pretty good. If you are a fan of 80 and 90s action flicks, then you gotta love this. Stallone is back with his gang plus Liam Hemsworth and we get a great rescue mission in the first 15 minutes of the film. They save someone pretty interesting. There's lots of guns, bombs, people getting their head shot off. Then Bruce Willis gives them a new mission, and the young guy gets killed, by the bad guy, conventialy named Villain, played by Van Damme. There's some silly plot about mines and plutonium, but that's not why you are watching. You want to see the 'old guys' kick some booty and fire guns and bombs.FINAL VERDICT: It's entertaining. If you like action, check it out.",7,3,4,8 April 2013
War Dogs," another movie about crazy schemes to make money
","This movie is supposedly based on a true story, I doubt much of what was in the movie was true. I'd say a lot of it was dramatized for entertainment. Basically it is about these 2 guys, Efraim (whom will cheat and lie for a buck) and David( whom seems somewhat honest). David joins Efraim's business which is buying military supplies and selling them to the US government. They go on an adventure to Jordan where they smuggle guns into Iraq and get chased by gun toting rebels. Then they have an opportunity to land a $300 million deal, only problem is the bullets they got can't be sold to the US. So Efraim schemes and of course it comes back to bite them in the #ss.FINAL VERDICT: I thought it was interesting, it's always fun when you have a movie in which people pull off crazy schemes that work for a while then they get in trouble. Check it out.",6,0,0,11 April 2017
The Longest Yard," Adam Sandler sucks at R rated comedy
","What was Adam Sandler thinking? To pick a remake of a film that shouldn't have been remade. And give it an R rating. Sandler needs to stick to what he does best, which is the off-beat guy who is sort of crazy and enjoys poking fun at himself. Here he plays this ex-football player that got kicked out of the NFL for shaving points. That right there makes him the popular guy, not the off-beat guy he always plays. He gets sent to prison for DUI, so you have all the male prison jokes thrown at you. None of its new and it's not funny. This prison is in Texas, where football is king. The warden has his guards on a football team. He suggest letting them play the cons as a warm up game, plus it will be on TV since the cons have the famous quarterback.Of course, the cons enjoy the opportunity to hit back at the guards. The movie turns dark for a while by having one of the main characters die in an explosion. It's like the movie can't make up its mind, is it a comedy or drama. Then the cons that this guy was close too are over it a few days because we got to get back to the laughs.The football game is boring, you know the cons will rally because they'll get together and be like, we have to win the game, we'll always have that. And there's the dramatic final play of the game. And the evil warden gets his humiliation.FINAL VERDICT: I don't recommend it. It's not funny and this is not the typical Sandler film.",3,2,4,23 July 2006
Source Code," ground hog day goes sci-fi
","This movie was OK, but I'm not a big fan of sci-fi movies because they have too many plot holes. Basically, a military guy, Colter, keeps reliving the same 8 minutes over and over trying to find a bomber on a train. So after you see the third reenactment, it starts to get old. I will say most of the movie did make sense and it wasn't filled with plot holes. But the ending, I didn't get, that's where the plot holes come in. Was it an alternate world Colton was living in? If so, how did the lady get the text whom was in 'normal' world? I did like the explanation the movie gave of how this was all possible and the state of Colter's body. It seemed plausible in the future.FINAL VERDICT: OK, I recommend it if you like sci-fi movies.",6,0,1,8 May 2012
Skyfall," worst villain in a Bond film
","I didn't think this James Bond film was very good. First the villain is terrible, he hardly does anything. Then there is not much of female lead. Bond doesn't have a girl he has to save. Then the plot just wasn't good. The bad guy, Silva, steals a list of under cover agents and is going to post 5 names every week. Why, he never ask for money, it is just to get back at M. He has a grudge against her. And it is like so what if he reveals the names, just pull those agents out.The only film was just boring and the plot was confusing. And I didn't think any of the action scenes were that good.FINAL VERDICT: just skip it, you won't be missing much.",3,4,10,27 August 2013
50 First Dates," the first good Adam Sandler film in a long time
","This movie was much better than I expected. For once, Sandler isn't playing this over-the-top annoying character. His character, Henry, actually turns out to be very sweet. The movie is about how Henry must make a girl, Lucy, fall in love with him every day because she has short term memory loss, and her memory is wiped clean every night when she sleeps. Her dad and brother have devised an elaborate scheme to make her think it is the same day every day rather than tell her the truth every morning. Every once in a while she finds out the truth and is very upset till the next day when she has forgotten. Henry gets the idea to make a video for her to watch in the morning that tells her the truth. It helps her to get over the shock in the first couple of hours, then she has the rest of the day to live her life and can finally meet up with old friends.Of course, we have the inevitable, I'm holding you back speech from Lucy and she wants Henry to stop seeing her. He agrees and decides to leave on his walrus research trip. Does he leave her behind? What do you think considering the type of film it is? Rob Schneider has a small role in this as Henry's buddy. He was good for some laughs, like when he talks about his wife or licks the coconut bra. And Sean Astin is Lucy's brother, who talks funny and is jacked up on roids. He was amusing.FINAL VERDICT: I found this movie to just be entertaining and sweet. I recommend it for all.",7,1,2,6 January 2005
Catch Me If You Can," Everyone should definitely catch this
","This has got to be one of the best movies of the year.  It was very entertaining and had some really funny scenes.  This movie was so good; I think I will read the book now.  I'm sure the movie left out some of the scams Frank pulled.  The acting was solid, but I'm not sure if TH or LD deserve any awards for it.  And normally, when a big star uses a funny accent, I hate it, but TH makes it work here.  I also liked the musical theme used.  It worked well when it was used during scenes where TH is hot on the trail of LD.  One thing I didn't like was the older Leo because the hair piece he wore looked awful. It was so fake looking; it looked like a dead animal on his head. 
(SPOILERS):  My 3 favorite scenes were: 1)at the Miami airport when they pull the guy dressed like a pilot out of the car and he shows the sign of who he is supposed to pick up 'Hanratty'  2)when Leo makes $400 from the hooker by giving her a fake $1400 check.  3)when Leo is at the hospital in the ER, asking the other residents if they concur. He runs out of the room and one resident is like, 'I should have concurred.'
There were other great parts.  I'd like to read the book to see if it explains exactly how he escaped from a bathroom on an airplane.  And, I would like to know if he really bought a pilot suit and was going to start his scam again after getting out of jail and working for the FBI or if that was just embelished for the movie. (END OF SPOILERS)
Who says crime doesn't pay!  The real Frank still works for the FBI and makes a lot of money.

The Hangover," not as good as advertised
","I was expecting to laugh a lot since this movie got such good reviews in the theater, but I didn't laugh once. It was OK, but I didn't find it funny. The film is about 4 guys going to Vegas a couple of days before one of them, Doug, is about to get married. One of them, Alan, buys some drugs and puts it in their drinks. It turns out to be roophies, so the foursome don't remember what happened in the morning. They wake up and soon to be groom, Doug, is missing. So, the other 3 try to track down what they did the previous night. It involves a baby, stripper, tiger, Chinese dude looking for his money, and Mike Tyson. Finally, one of them guesses where Doug might be then they have to get back in time for the wedding.FINAL VERDICT: Some what entertaining, but I was disappointed. Still worth checking out since so many people thought it was better than me.",5,0,2,28 May 2010
Iron Man 3," one of the better super hero films
","I thought this movie was OK and it kept me entertained. I think I liked it better than the other Iron Man movies. In the movie, there is terrorist, the Mandarian, whom is waging war against the USA. He wants to get at the President. Tony Stark tells the Mandarian to bring it on. So his house gets attacked and he's on the hunt to figure out what is going on with mysterious explosions. Eventually we find out there is new technology that allows people to build up heat and they can shoot fireballs and melt things. Tony finally tracks down the Mandarian, and it turns out he is more of a joke. The real evil guy has of course kidnapped Pepper and Tony must find a way to destroy these heat retaining people.FINAL VERDICT: It was OK for a super hero film.

Marie Antoinette," eye candy without much plot
","I really liked all the costumes, scenery, and makeup; however, the movie as a whole wasn't that entertaining. Also, it is a little weird watching a movie about the French when they all talk like Americans. The movie is about Maie Antoinette as a teenager. We see her movie to France, marry soon to be king Louie, and what her life was like right after marriage. I don't know how factual this is, but the film depicts the 2 newlyweds as 'cold' in the bedroom. Not really anything is happening there. And Marie needs to have an heir to solidify her standing in France. She is humiliated when Louie's younger brother has a child before they do. It shows her gambling, partying and during this time the masses of France are living in poverty and starving. The very ending shows the angry mobs outside the palace and the ending shows the royal family being taken away and it ends like that. I didn't like that ending either. It was too abrupt.I didn't think any of the actors had any memorable roles. It was simply a blah type of movie.FINAL VERDICT: I think it is aimed toward teens, but they would find it boring. I wouldn't watch it again.",4,3,4,1 November 2007
Child 44," story should have been written better
","The biggest distraction in this movie is that it is set in Russia, yet everyone speaks English. It just takes away from the storyline because these are supposed to be Russians. Any way, Leo whom was an orphan turned war hero turned military policeman is given a case of someone he knows. This man's son has been murdered; however, he must declare it an accident because Stalling says there can't be murder in paradise. He does some digging and finds other boys that have been killed in a similar manner. but his wife is named as a traitor so they are sent to 'Siberia or some such place.' Leo continues to look into the murders and narrows down where the killer may live and work and soon he's solved the mystery and survived the political gauntlet.The ending is OK with everything solved and it was a pretty good mystery.FINAL VERDICT: The story was OK but having everyone speak English just made it seem out of place. I recommend it if you can catch if for free on cable.",6,1,3,5 January 2016
The Ring," What a let down
","The Ring moves along slowly and the ending makes no sense. One scene made me jump(SPOILER:when the girl climbs out of the TV).  The video tape had nothing scary about it.  It was just a bunch of jumbled images in which some were explained later in the film and others weren't. And the film never explains how the tape came into existance to begin with. And what was with the horse on the ferry. A horse goes crazy, big deal. And the kid's character was a total rip off from 6th sense. He says he talks to the dead girl, but that is never explained.  But the ending takes the cake as the dumbest explaination ever in a horror film. (SPOILERS) The lady, Rachel, assumes the reason she survived is because she made a copy of the tape. Huh! What! That is so stupid, so she gets her son to make a copy. That was just ridiculous. It's like the writer couldn't think of anything clever so he just came up with the simplest idea, regardless if it really made sense.FINAL VERDICT: Big let down! Not scary! Just an average movie.",Null,1,4,15 October 2003
Deepwater Horizon," real life explosion drama
","This movie based on real events of the biggest oil spoil in US waters was pretty good. I thought it introduced the secondary characters as best it could, mainly the wife and kid of Mike Williams. The film even tries to relay to people via the kid's school project, what exactly is going on at the rig, but the whole kill line and pressure still didn't make much sense to me. Anyways the action was good and great special effects with all the fiery explosions. It'a wonder the whole rig just didn't explode right away with the gas in the air and most would have died. Instead 11 didn't survive, which was amazing considering all the explosions. FINAL VERDICT: Interesting topic and good special effects. Worth a viewing.",6,0,0,20 May 2017
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Alice is back with no plot
","I like the Resident Evil movies, but this one had no plot. It's basically Alice and her friends shooting guns at zombies and using some Matrix style fighting. How did Alice get gas to fly the plane and what happened to all her clones after the beginning of the movie? And who was the bad guy with the sun glasses? Well, I guess none of that really matters as long as Alice is able to find a stash of guns along the way. How about when they get through into the sewer system, next shot is them on a boat out to the Arcadia. How did they get the boat, 15 minutes seemed to be missing. And Arcadia was disappointing, at least they could have had some mean mutant monster made by Umbrella on there.FINAL VERDICT: Adds nothing, skip it.",4,0,1,20 June 2011
United 93," you know what will happen...
","but this movie was still entertaining. I liked how in the beginning we get a perspective of what the terrorists were going through as they prepared to take their own lives. The actions depicted on the airplane seemed reasonable with what could have happened. Once the hijacked the terrorists over take the cockpit in a very brutal fashion. All the passengers are sequestered at the back of the plane. They make phone calls and find out what has been going on with the world trade center. The high point is when the passengers decide they must try to overtake the hijackers. Unfortunately, we already know the outcome and that they did not have enough time to save the plane.I also liked the idea of showing what went on in the air traffic control rooms across the country. There were confused as to how many planes were hijacked and the military seemed to be disorganized. They couldn't get a straight answer from anyone in the beginning.FINAL VERDICT: Worth seeing. Tells a worth while story of true events that are still emotional watching.",7,1,2,3 May 2007
Deja Vu," time travel is just to confusing
","This movie was mediocre at best. Time travel is always confusing and filled with plot holes. Doug Carlin is brought in by the FBI and shown new technology that enables them to view what is happening 4 and half days in the past. They are trying to stop the bombing of a ferry in New Orleans. Doug wants to go back in time to stop the bombing and save Claire, whom he is fond of after having watching her.When Doug hops in the hummer chasing the truck that was driving around 4 days in the past was really pushing the realm of silliness. The whole idea is just to unbelievable. And why didn't someone come with Doug. He needed some one else to where the hat while he drove.Denzel plays the role good as usual. I just don't get time travel films very much. They are too confusing.FINAL VERDICT: I guess sci-fi fans will definitely want to see it. But some of the ideas in this were just too far fetched.",5,1,3,12 October 2007
It," the clown needed to be scarier
","This movie was OK, but it needed some more action and some more scares. I take it an evil demon is terrorizing this town and it's just not scary enough. The clown's cgi teeth didn't look real, more silly. And just too much of the kids sitting around talking and not moving the plot along. Having blood spew forth from a sink soaking the bathroom was not scary. And having a couple of mean bullies not scary, should have had them meet a gruesome death.FINAL VERDICT: For Stephen King fans, plot too slow for most people.",5,0,2,3 July 2018
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," the civil war was really the undead war....
","according to this movie. Before watching this film, you must forget everything you know about history, and take this as completely fictional except that their was a man named Abe Lincoln and he married Mary Todd. But what Abe does in this is not based on anything historical. First he some how has super human strength and can cut a huge tree down with one swing of an axe. Then his mom was killed by a vampire, so when older he wants to hunt them. Another vampire, Henry, helps him some, gives him tips, etc. Along the way, Abe meets Mary, he still is killing vamps, becomes a lawyer and eventually President. So skip to him in the White House and battle of Gettysburg. It seems General Davis has made a deal with vamps that are throughout the South and has vamps fighting the north. Abe comes up with a plan to collect all the silver and use it in battle. He rewrites history but the end result is still the same. And of course, the main vamp was the one that killed his mom and whom he wants revenge against.FINAL VERDICT: A crazy vampire movie that came about because of the Twilight movies. Not good enough to recommend.",5,0,1,6 May 2013
Minority Report," Just OK
","If this was supposed to be one of the best movies of 2002, then they doesn't say much for the quality of movies that have been released this year.  I liked the last half hour, when we find out who the bad guy really is. But the ending is so Spielberg like. 
(SPOILERS) Why do we have to see Tom Cruise back with his wife and she's pregnant.  So, precrime doesn't exist any more, and everything is right with the world again. It is like another fairytale ending that didn't need to be there.  It would have been better if this film was more darker.(END OF SPOILERS)
The first part of the movie has some slow points and the plot does get kind of convoluted.  And Colin Farrell, who is the best part about the movie, should have been in it more.  And I really hated all the add placements. I mean, I'm sure they put those in there because companies paid a lot of money, but it just makes Spielberg look like a sell out. Are we supposed to believe that new stores haven't come about 50 years in the future. And we are supposed to believe Cops is still on FOX. The Cops show was the dumbest of them all.
FINAL VERDICT: This doesn't even compare to the greatness of another sci-fi film, the Matrix.  It's worth seeing at some matinee, but just don't go in expecting greatness because you won't get it.  It's more of a murder mystery with just futuristic special effects thrown in.",Null,0,0,21 July 2002
Training Day," you love to hate DW in this
","DW does a great acting job at being the psychotic, manipulative, corrupt undercover cop.  Throughout the film, he tries to convince the rookie, naive cop EH that it is OK to be corrupt and not fool with putting the little guys away. He's satisfied to let gang members kill each other off rather than fool with paper work.  But, DW pushed EH too far, and EH decides he won't let DW get away with it.  After he gets away from the tense bathtub scene, he decided to deal with DW who ditched him at a gang house.
The final shoot out/fight between DW and EH is well done. DW does a great job as he tries to explain he's still top dog and still does not back down even when the other gang members won't bail him out.
FINAL VERDICT:  Very good bad cop/good cop flick with great acting and tense scenes.  Definitely worth watching.",Null,1,12,4 November 2002
Friday Night Lights," a good sports movie
","This movie was an entertaining account of what high school football can be in some parts of the country. Here, we have a west Texas high school team from a small town. Everyone goes to the games. The kids are constantly reminded by their elders how they won state and show off their championship rings. The coach is constantly asked around town about the team and winning state. Some of the big wigs imply win state or else you may be out of a job. Drama comes from the season ending injury of the star running back. There's also a fullback whose dad stays drunk a lot and is always on his tail about hanging onto the football and winning state like he did. He punches and verbally abuses his son all the time. There's the quarterback who just wants to get a college scholarship to get out of the small town and away from his needy mother.So, the film follows the team from preseason till the end and they have a 'miracle' type of season.FINAL VERDICT: I recommend it. It's an entertaining sports movie and fairly realistic because in Texas some people do take their football a little too seriously.",7,0,2,11 August 2005
John Wick," cool idea, but lead miscast
","Liam Neeson must have been busy, so the director got Keanu Reeves to take his place. Problem is Reeves isn't known for playing this type of character and took away something from the film.However, since the film has got a cool plot to it, it's still pretty good even with Reeves as the lead. Reeves plays John Wick, the deadliest hit-man ever, that just so happens to be retired because he fell in love. Well, his wife died and left him a puppy. He encounters some punk Russian kid that wants his ride. Later the kid shows up, takes the ride, kills the dog, and beats up John. Well, he messed with the wrong guy. It just so happens the kid's mob dad was the guy John used to work for and now he wants revenge.What's cool in the movie is the whole hit-man code speech, the Continental hotel (where one doesn't do business), paying with these gold coins, and making a dinner reservation. The ending is where the film falls apart and just becomes another action flick with the 'hero' out to get the final bad guy. It was rather silly, but the first 80 minutes was really good.FINAL VERDICT: Check it out, good story for action fans.",7,0,4,29 June 2015
Kung Fu Panda," good animation, so-so story
","I thought this animated film was OK, but I'm sure 10 year old kids would love it. The best part of the film is the stellar animation; definitely one of Dreamworks best efforts. The story is about a panda, Po, whom loves kung fu. He is chosen to become the dragon warrior over the fab 5. As the chosen one, he is allowed to look at the dragon scroll and is destined to defeat Tai Lung, an evil snow leopard. Po is taught kung fu by his master Shifu and the other main characters were the fab 5, the snake, tiger, mantis, monkey, and crane. The film is written to be funny, and is somewhat amusing.

A Star Is Born," ok songs, needed better character development
","Yes Lady Gaga has a few good songs in this but the biggest fault of this film is the relationship between Ally and Jackson. Not enough time was spent on it and I just didn't buy them falling in love and getting married in such a short time. I mean Jack goes missing because he gets drunk and then in the next scene Ally is ready to marry him. She obviously was disapproving of his drinking but is ready to marry him even though he is no where near ready to give up the bottle. And the movie doesn't portray her is money hungry and going after him for fame. She wouldn't have married him. And when Jack gets drunk at the Grammy's that would not have happened. Directors or producers would not let an act go on stage completely hammered like that. Neither would have Jack's manager. And I don't buy Jack deciding to off himself when Ally was sticking by him. Just didn't buy the characters.FINAL VERDICT: OK , but over-hyped. If you like Gaga or Bradly Cooper, then definitely check it out.",6,2,3,18 June 2019

Some die and two survive floating in space trying to get to the next orbiting satellite.Some more things happen and with the right amount of luck, one of the astronauts, Ryan, can make it back to earth.I didn't think it was that great of a role for Sandra Bullock, I'm surprised she was nominated.

","I really liked this movie, but they should have come up with a different name because it spoils the entire movie. From the start, you know only one of the Seals is going to make it.Anyways the story takes place in Afghanistan where 4 Seals are sent on a mission in the mountains to take out a Taliban leader. Their mission is compromised when 3 goat herders stumble onto them. My biggest question is, why didn't they just leave them tied up till the mission was over, and then release them. Or why not wait until dark, knock all 3 out, untie them, then get out of there before they could warn the Taliban. The solution they chose was stupid on their part.Anyways, soon the Seals are surrounded and a thrilling gun fight ensues. It's very disturbing to think anyone in real life being in that situation. Also, I find it hard to believe that the villagers would help an American, but maybe that part is true. I guess they thought the Taliban was worse.FINAL VERDICT: Good story, intense action, definitely check it out.",7,0,0,1 November 2014

I liked the plot for the most part. It's about how Kirk and his fellow shipmates got their start on the USS Enterprise and how they landed their positions. They are battling the evil Nero whom is using red matter to create black holes to wipe out whole planets. But the whole part with this being a future Nero and a future Spock I didn't like.

Fury," a tank crew that stays together....
","survives together or not. In this movie, a newcomer, Norman, joins a tank crew during the war in Germany. He's only trained to be a typist, so what he sees upon joining the tank really blows his mind. Brad Pitt plays Wardaddy, the boss. Boyd is the religious one, Gordo the cool one, and Grady the crazy one. At first, Norman doesn't want to shoot and is taught a humiliating lesson by Wardaddy about shooting Krauts. I thought that went against character and made Wardaddy not likable. Soon they are fighting and survive a close call, and then take over a town. While there an extended scene is thrown in where Wardaddy and Norman take up in a residence with 2 girls. It seems Wardaddy just wants them to make something to eat, but it is so weird and then wants Norman to take one girl into the bedroom. Then his other 3 crew show up and are so rude, but Wardaddy doesn't throw them out. Why not? Then the tank crew is given a mission to hold crossroads and they have to do it by themselves. The tank breaks but they hold on when a Nazi caravan show up. Only Norman survives. What I didn't get was they throw some grenades inside, and later when Norman climbs back into the tank, Wardaddy is still intact. Wouldn't he have been blown to pieces? Anyway, at the end we see they had killed a large number of the Nazis and American troops had showed up.I thought the gore and war violence was pretty good. It was more realistic and not for shock value.FINAL VERDICT: I thought it was an OK war film. Worth checking out if you like these type of films.",6,1,6,15 June 2015
Monster," It's hard to believe Charlize Theron played the lead...
","because with the extra pounds, brown contact lenses, and make up to give her bad skin make her unrecognizable. She was very good and deserved the acting awards she got, but overall the movie was just OK. It seemed more like an HBO movie since the plot was simple and it moved along slowly. And they uglyed Christina Ricci; she looks bad with a mullet. But the film does deserve some of the criticism it got by making Aileen almost sympathetic. There was nothing sympathetic about her. She killed her johns for money and it was premeditated.And for those interested, the make out scenes with Theron and Ricci were very mild to what's in other films.FINAL VERDICT: It wasn't the best film of the year, but at least it had a plot that made sense and wasn't unbelievable. So, if you like seeing stuff on serial killers, I recommend it.",6,0,6,22 December 2004
The Rookie," Nothing exciting happens
","At best, I would say this makes a very average TV movie. It is boring and too long. And I am sure some of the scenes in the movie did not happen in real life. Like when Jimmy stops his truck on a road at night to throw a baseball past a speed radar. And the radar just happens to have a few burnt out lights just in the right place to make a 9 look like a 7. Things like that ruin a movie that is based on a real life story because obviously that was just written for the movie and didn't really happen. And the whole relationship between Jimmy and his father was just to much of a cliche for these types of films. Father and son don't get along. Father doesn't support son to  follow foolish dreams. Son proves father wrong and they hug at the end.FINAL VERDICT: I don't recommend this unless you are a baseball fan. It is too boring for the average movie watcher.",Null,0,3,8 March 2003
Memento," great idea

This movie isn't for the 'simple-minded'. You actually have to pay attention and follow the story or you will get lost quick. I also liked the idea of how it tells the very beginning of the story in black and white segments through out the film. I thought Guy Pearce was really good. I thought he should have been nominated for acting awards.

I see some of the reviews here are complaining about the wordiness of scenes. But that is what makes Tarantino's films different and more interesting. You need to pay attention to what is said. Also, there is a lot less violence in this movie that what we usually see in Tarantino's films. Brad Pitt's accent is ridiculous and his Italian was just funny.I thought part 1 was brilliant with the interrogation of the dairy farmer. I also liked the ending with the movie Shosanna made.

Underworld," the story could have been better, but the special effects were good
","(Spoilers Beware)It's about this gun-toting, bad *ss vampire, Selene, who figures out the lycons are after a human, Michael. She wants to find out why. She finds Michael, but not before he gets bitten by the leader of the werewolves. Then by ways that didn't make much sense, she figures out the head vampire, Lucian, is in some kind of conspiracy with the lycons. So, she wakens the eldest vampire, Victor, to prevent a lychon arising. Along the way she falls for Michael but that part was badly written because nothing ever happens between them that would make you think they like each other. And it's forbidden for a vampire and lycon to be together, like Romeo and Juliet, and there is a subplot behind Victor having killed his daughter for loving a lychon and killing Selene's family. It starts turning into a soap opera. Along the way, there are several battles between vampires and lychons. The lychons look real. Then, they through in this part about Michael being a descendant of the cursed blood line. If bitten by a vampire and lycon, people die; but Michael's blood can handle both viruses. So, Selene ends up biting him and he turns into this ugly monster. Then there is the final duel between Victor and Selene/Michael.This movie didn't have a good soundtrack and it blatantly rips off a lot of films like Matrix, Terminater 2 ( with the lycon jumping on top of the car) to name a couple. And the guy that played head vampire, Lucian, was a terrible actor. He overacted every line and sounded ridiculous. None of the actors were too good. Kate Beckinsale was bland on screen and now we know why Scot Speedman is just known for being on Felicity.FINAL VERDICT: If you like movies with guns and good special effects, then I recommend it. But it isn't original.",Null,0,0,30 August 2004
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," well known actors should not attempt a foreign accent...
","Nicholas Cage and his so fake accent really made this film worse than it really was. From other reviews I've read, I was expecting a really boring, awful film. While not that exciting, it wasn't as bad as I expected.  The movie was definitely too long.  The last 20 minutes I just kept looking at the clock. I will give it credit for having some beautiful outside shots of the ocean and landscape.
(SLIGHT SPOILERS): And they didn't have to have some little happy ending either.  It was so silly how they just added a couple of grey streaks on the side of Cage's hair to show that several years had passed.  And once again,Penelope Cruz does a below average acting job.  She is just annoying to watch.  And had no chemistry with either Cage or Bale.  And Bale, who is usually good, doesn't have much to work with here.And I had a real problem about someone getting shot multiple times, then with no antibiotics and few medical supplies, they still survive even after they had been left for dead hours before being found. No way does he fully recover from that like they show in the movie.

The ending was different than the original and other parts were different, such as walking underground to an adjacent building.There were plenty of chainsaws and splicing through legs. One fat lady looked beyond disgusting before she turned into a zombie. I liked the way the film was shot. A good contrast of dark and light was used and parts of the film had a campy feel to it. For example, in the middle of the film, an upbeat music plays as they put together the driving vehicles.FINAL VERDICT: Worth a viewing if you like the horror genre.",6,0,1,19 April 2005

To be fair, I just don't really care for the Iron Man idea, Spiderman and Batman are much better ideas.But there's just a lot of explosions and computer special effects. Plus Tony Stark is too weird and boring, the part with him getting drunk at the party and the colonel using one of the Iron Man suits was just boring and too long. The only part I liked was the first fight between Ivan and Tony. The electrically charged cables were a cool weapon. And Gwenyth Paltro is just a waste. She's so boring in these movies.FINAL VERDICT: I don't really like Iron Man any way, so I don't recommend it, but I'm sure a lot of people liked this.",4,1,3,27 February 2012
Two for the Money," OK movie but....
","seemed more of a TNT type of film rather than something released in theaters. There are A list movie stars. Only problem is the subject matter isn't that exciting. The film is about sports betting, which is not that thrilling. Walter is a 'king' in sports betting and recruits Brandon to New York to make football picks. At first Brandon, goes on a long winning streak and makes a lot of money. He starts picking losers and the pressure gets to him. He even is threatened by a mobster type of guy who has lost a lot of money with his picks. And to top things off, Brandon gets a little too chummy with Walter's wife. Also Walter confesses he's back to betting with Brandon's picks and is in the red also. Brandon comes to a realization and must decide what type of life he wants to lead.There was nothing great about the acting. And the film at 2 hours was too long. I agree with other reviews that the last hour was to slow. The first hour was much better with Brandon getting to the top.FINAL VERDICT: I would not pay to see this. But if you like Matt Mcconaughey it's worth checking out. There are several shirtless scenes by him.",5,1,2,22 August 2006
World War Z," could have been great...
","if it had a little better story and was rated R. This is a zombie flick, people want to see zombies bite and this movie cuts that all out. The Walking Dead on cable shows more gore than this movie.Brad Pitt is an ex war reporter. One day the city turns to you know what and he's asked to come back into the game. Of course, he doesn't want to, but in order to get his family to safety, he agrees to. First they must survive the night when things turn to chaos, and this was the best part of the film. Then they get rescued and taken to a big ship. Pit is sent on a mission to find the origin of the virus and of course when zombies are involved, this doesn't go as planned. He goes to Korea but the best special effects are in Isreal when the zombies form a ladder and all that ensues there.Then Pitt survives a plane crash, are you kidding me. But get beyond that and he happens to be within walking distance of WHO center and no zombies in sight. Then there is a pretty crazy solution to the problem, but there is an open ending. I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel.FINAL VERDICT: I like zombie movies so I did like this. Basically if they had made it R rated and shown zombie kills, etc... it would have been a lot better. But it's good enough to watch if you need an apocalypse fix.",6,0,0,11 April 2014
Passengers," outer space love story
","This movie was really more of a love story than anything else, not a sci-fi thriller which is how the preview portrayed it. Jim is a passenger on a spaceship on the way to another planet that takes over 100 hundred years to get to. His body has been put asleep like all 5000 passengers. But he wakes up and is alone and for a year; he tries to get to the crew(behind solid doors) and tries to put his body back to sleep but none of that works. He only has a robot to talk too.So he starts reading biographies of people on board and sort of falls in love with Aurora. So he decides to wake her up even though it is like a death sentence. She doesn't know what he did, so they become a couple. Of course when she finds out he woke her up, she hates him. As time goes by, the ship has more malfunctions, due to a meteor hit. Eventually, someone else wakes up but he is very sick and not much help. But he tells them they have to fix the ship before it just explodes due to the malfunctions.So Jim risks his life to save the ship and Aurora forgives him. Other crew members wake up so their trip is saved.FINAL VERDICT: OK would have been better if more of a thriller. Worth a viewing.",6,0,1,17 July 2017
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," has the plot of a date movie, but the raunchiness of American Pie
","I thought this movie was pretty funny. And it's ONLY for adults. Some of the language and visuals( like full male nudity and various sex positions) make this a far cry from a date movie. However, the story says different.TV star Sarah Marshall breaks up with her 5 year boyfriend Peter. He gets really down in the dumps over it. At first he tries to tag any girl he can but is still depressed. So, he decides a vacation to Hawaii is best. He picks a hotel that Sarah often talked about. And as luck would have it, Sarah is there on holiday with her new boyfriend, British singer Aldous Snow. Peter decides to stay anyways, and front desk clerk, Rachel, helps him out by letting him stay in the best suite for free.Peter begins to like Rachel and they go out several times. He also keeps running into Sarah and Aldous, and they try to act like it is not as awkward as it is. Aldous is like most stero typical rockers, he's all about the chicks. So, it doesn't take him very long to get bored with Sarah. He's very polite and wants to be Peter's friend.So do things work out with Peter and Rachel? How many women does Aldous bag? Or how about does the naive honeymoon couple finally figure things out? FINAL VERDICT: One of the funnier movies that's been released in the past year. As long as you aren't a prude, then you should enjoy this one.",8,0,3,9 March 2009
The Hunger Games," exciting adventure....
","but the movie should have been rated R to tell the story better. By this I mean, it is about teens brutally killing each other to win a contest; the violence sounds like an R rating to me. It would have been better if the kills were actually shown and more gore and blood to show the horror of it. Instead, it was really toned down to get a pg13 rating.The beginning was a little slow, like others have said, the game was the focus of the film and doesn't start to over an hour in. Some things that didn't make sense was how could they conger up fire and dogs that were real in the game, made no sense. If you could do that, why not wipe out all the people in the lesser districts so you don't have to worry about keeping them under control. I liked Woody Harrelson's character, he knew how to play all the power people perfectly. Did any of the other kids get help from their mentor? It was never shown.FINAL VERDICT: Fun, adventure film. I haven't read the books, but I bet quite a bit got left out because there wasn't room to put it in the movie. The only negative is it is set up for a sequel, and it will be many months before it's released.",7,1,5,1 January 2013
The Impossible," a touching story
","I thought this movie was really good and was surprised to learn it didn't get nominated for best picture. It is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The movie says it is a true story and if all of it is true and not embellished for Hollywood, it really seems impossible. It's about a couple and their 3 kids whom are in the tsunami in Thailand and their survival. First, I thought the special effects showing the rushing water and waves hitting were really good. I have no idea how they made it look so realistic. I don't know how anyone could not have drowned being in the rushing water with objects flying around.Then the rest of the movie is about the family coming together and finding each other in chaos. I thought it was an emotional story and written well. Much better than most movies now days.FINAL VERDCIT: Definitely check it out.",8,0,1,2 March 2014
Shaun of the Dead," an amusing slightly bloody Brithish spoof
","This basically follows the guidelines for other zombie films. Once bitten you turn into a zombie. But this one is for laughs. The zombies move slow and have weird looks on their faces and moan in a silly way. Our heroes, Shaun and Ed don't seem to notice the chaos going around until they get up one morning. In one funny scene, Shaun goes to the store to get his usual drink and doesn't notice blood on the door or people dead in allies. The two spot a zombie in the yard and turn on the TV and find out what's going on. They try to bash the zombie's head in a series of funny events. They contrive a plan to pick up Shaun's mom, girlfriend, and head over the local pub. So, we get more silly zombie encounters. When the step-dad turns, they just leave him in the car instead of kicking him out and taking the car. But it doesn't matter because the zombies are too slow. They make it to the pub and there is a fast conclusion just when you think they have no where left to run.FINAL VERDICT: Comical horror spoof, much better than the Scary Movie spoofs. I recommend this for anyone who can't miss a zombie film.",7,1,2,28 July 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," The sequel is a new adventure
","I liked this movie. It is a sequel that begins a new quest, this time to find dead man's chest. It ends set up for the third film that is its conclusion. The first film stands alone, but sets up many of the characters in this new adventure.The special effects are just as good and there is a new villain, Davy Jones, whose tentacles have a mind of their own. The new dead pirates on Jones' ship were cool, there was the one with the hammer head and shell head, just really cool. We don't get to see much of the Kraken until the end, but when we see it's mouth, wow! Also, Johnny Depp is once again great and the humor is back. I thought it was almost as funny as the first. And I thought the plot made sense. I don't agree with all these reviews saying it was too long, plot hard to follow. I thought it was very entertaining.FINAL VERDICT: If you liked the first, this is a must see. I will go see the third film in the theater. It opens this weekend.",9,2,4,23 May 2007
Argo," entertaining political film
","I thought this was a good, well written film. It was much better than zero dark thirty, another political movie that came the same year. I knew nothing of the story behind this movie before seeing the film. I'm sure not all of it was 100 percent correct. I wonder when this happened, did the police really chase down the Swiss plane right before take off. I don't know, but it certainly made it entertaining for the movie.What I really liked was it was well written and acted and not drawn out and the scenes in the movie just went together. I think it deserved the best picture Oscar last year. I haven't seen a better film from last year.FINAL VERDICT: Definitely check it out.",8,0,2,10 September 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," What's all the praise over
","This movie was OK, but not what I call great. I'm glad I didn't pay to see it.  Johnny Depp is good and has to be since his character carries the film. But, I was expecting to get a lot more laughs out of him, and I didn't. The plot was OK, but not what I call original.  Of course, the special effects with the skeleton pirates were great. That must have been a huge part of the budget.  I guess since the horrible Mummy 2 and Tomb Raider movies, audiences went crazy over this adventure type of film because it didn't suck like so many recent summer flicks.Also, Rush made a good villian. But, I don't think Bloom or Knightly were outstanding. Anyone could have done those roles. I see they are already planning a sequel.  Considering how paper thin the plot was for this one, the sequel will likly be bad like Mummy 2, but make a lot of money.FINAL VERDICT:  If you are into the adventure movies, then this one is for you.",Null,1,2,17 May 2004
Hostel," This is really sick
","but still manages to entertain. The movie starts slow with 3 guys getting some advice to visit this hostel in eastern Europe because the girls are so hot and will have plenty of sex with Americans. So, they go there and along the way meet a creepy man on the train who 'touches' one of the guys. They get to the hostel and find their roommates are very hot girls who are more than willing to party, take drugs, and partake in bedroom games. After a wild night, the guy from Iceland has disappeared. The other 2 roommates look for him but no luck. The next night, Paxton wakes up and Josh is gone. Paxton is suspicious by now but still goes with the hot girls when they say they will take him to Josh. What Paxton discovers is sick beyond belief. Gruesome torture, body parts everywhere. It turns out he has been targeted by a group of people who find victims for very rich people to kill and torture for kicks. Will he escape? Will he get revenge? If you can stomach it, you will find out.FINAL VERDICT: Lots of sex and blood. Horror fans should definitely check this out.",7,1,1,12 August 2007
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," a classic given a new life
","I remember watching the cartoon version of this when I was a kid. I always liked the story. This movie tells the story again; this time with real people and cgi animals. The animals were very well done. It's hard to tell at times that the animals are not real. You can see where all the money went.I didn't think the final battle was all that great. It was just a lot of animals, whom were not central characters,running at each other. It was so generic; you've seen that type of battle numerous times in adventure films.FINAL VERDICT: It's a fun adventure. Excellent special effects, but most importantly is it has a good story to go along with them.",7,0,0,30 September 2006
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Steve Carell needed to be more....
","sympathetic for this to be a really good movie. The main problem I had with this film is that the main character, Cal, played by Carell isn't likable enough. He does some hurtful things to his wife, Emily, even though he wants to get back with her. The movie begins with Emily asking for a divorce and revealing she had an affair. She kicks Cal out and he drowns his sorrows in a bar. At the bar, he meets ladies man, Jacob. Jacob wants to help Cal out and help him pick up woman, which he does.Then there are the side plots with Cal's son liking his baby sitter and the baby sitter liking Cal. Plus, Cal's daughter Nanna has a new guy and he's shocked when he finds out who it is.So, the whole movie is about relationships and crushes. It's not really funny, but is amusing at times. It's just that I didn't care who ended up with who.FINAL VERDICT: More of a chick flick, don't expect lots of laughs.",5,0,2,17 June 2012
The Notebook," Entertaining tale of true love
","This was a very underrated film because I never even heard of it till I saw it on cable. It's about a story of true love. Nick and Ally get together while her family is on vacation. Her parents don't approve of Nick, mainly because he isn't rich like them. They go back home and Ally's mom aides in keeping the two apart. So years pass, and they finally see each other again. Each is involved with someone else but not yet married. It doesn't take long for them to start up an affair. Destiny brings the two together as how it should be. Neither were as happy in their other relationships as they were together.This movie was better than most because it was told wonderfully and didn't have a lot of bad dialog or unbelievable plot twists. I don't rate many films a 10.FINAL VERDICT: I recommend this for anyone looking for a romantic film and even if you aren't, I'd still check it out. It's that good.",10,0,0,20 June 2005
The Rocker," average film, decent music
","This movie was OK. It's probably more for the teen crowd. I thought the original songs were OK. I think the actors that played Curtis and Amelia have potential. The character Rainn Wilson plays made me think of one thing 'Jack Black'. I mean the role of Fish was perfect for him, but I guess he wouldn't do it, so Wilson took the role.The best parts were when it showed Vesvious starting out. Having Fish chase the van was just creepy and using the drum sticks to punch holes in the roof. You got to love the 80s look with the hair and black eyeliner. Then at the end, they all have British accents.Of course, you have to look past the timeline in order to buy into this film. In the movie, ADD goes from you tube to having a number one album from touring a couple of midwestern states in like 3 months. It's a comedy, so get over it.FINAL VERDICT: If you like the music in this, then you should like the movie. It's nothing earth shattering, but I thought it was 90 minutes of decent entertainment.",5,2,6,16 August 2009
Public Enemies," it was OK, but not enough action
","Johnny Depp is great in this as usual. He plays 1920s bank robber Johnny Dillinger. Most of the story is about Johnny and his gang robbing some banks and they get caught. He escapes and is still tracked by FBI agent, Melvin Purvis. There is also his in this, Billie. He basically gets followed again because he can't leave her only. The FBI eventually gets her for aiding and abetting, but Johnny gets away. He can't stay away and makes contact with an old female friend that is giving info to the FBI. So, he does get what's coming to him.My main problem was most of the action was bank robbing or car chases. It wasn't very exciting and it needed something more considering it was well over 2 hours.FINAL VERDICT: Definitely for all Depp fans; it was OK but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it.",5,0,0,12 July 2010
Madagascar," boring....
","That's the one word that comes to mind. This was painful to sit through. I would think even kids would get bored. It's not funny; and the characters are dull. I was expecting a cartoon like Shrek, that was clever, entertaining. But it's the exact opposite. At least it was only 80 minutes long.Four animals escape the zoo in NYC. They are caught and are being shipped to Africa. Their crates get knocked off the boat and drift to Madagascar. There they meet the lemurs. They experience the wild and the lion wants to eat the zebra, his best friend. And that's the whole story.FINAL VERDICT: Boring, I would never want to sit through this again.",4,0,2,20 June 2006
The Other Boleyn Girl," seemed like more fiction than fact
","I thought this movie had a lot of fictitious things in it. The story is based on true events and people, but I don't think that everything that happened in the movie happened in reality.Also, none of the 3 main actors were very good. Bana had little chemistry with Portman or Johannason. Maybe it's because he is so much older. Also he looks to polished to be playing the gluten, Henry the VIII. It even seemed like the actors lost their English accent as the movie went on.FINAL VERDICT: The Tudors on shotime tell the Henry the VIII story a lot better. I recommend watching that series if you want to see something on this subject.",4,0,1,10 January 2009

","The story of this movie is that a family of 4 goes on a beach vacation and encounter their dopplegangers. It's the same beach that the mom had a scary encounter years ago when she was a kid. Anyways the family see's another family in their driveway at night. They call the police but they never come. And soon the family breaks in and threatens them and the twist is the 4 look like the original family of 4. A plot hole is why didn't they just kill them immediately. There is another family that is immediately taken out when they encounter their dopplegangers. So the family eventually survives the night, only to face off with the dopplegangers again. They we are told what is going on and it's something about a government experiment and rabbits are involved. It doesn't make a lot of sense. Then we get the finally twist and that is the mom is really the doppleganger and that many years ago the evil twin switched places. So why does the evil mom act like that?FINAL VERDICT: Quite a few plot holes and the overall government experiment solution doesn't make a lot of sense. Ok for some jumps. Worth checking out.",6,1,2,2 December 2019
The Danish Girl," Oscar liberal bait
","I thought this movie was good and that Eddie Redmayne portrayed better acting in this than in the movie he won the Oscar. This is definitely a liberal film, but it is still enjoyable even if you aren't.The movie is about a married couple, whom are both artists. The husband, Einar, begins to enjoy dressing as a woman and his wife, Gerda, begins painting him like that and only these paintings are considered worthy enough to sell. Einar flirts with a man as Lili, breaking Gerda's heart. Gerda gets an offer to move to Paris to sell her art, so they both move. There Einar explores the transsexual world more and sees doctors, but they think he has a mental/chemical problem. Finally he sees a doctor whom is interested in performing the first transgender surgery. Gerda still loves him but comes to except him as Lili and is still there for her during the surgery. But all doesn't go well during a time of considerable infection risk.FINAL VERDICT: This is a good drama, with a different story to tell. Definitely adult themed. But worth checking out.",7,0,1,27 August 2016
The Girl Next Door," false advertising
","From the commericals I remember on TV, this movie was made out to be another American Pie type of film. But, there is little comedy in it; it is more of a drama. A very hot porn star moves next door for two weeks next to your typical high school senior nerd. He falls for the girl and doesn't learn she's a porn star till his friends show him a tape. She falls for him and realizes she isn't really a slut. Then we have some curves thrown in the plot. Kelly, who Danielle works for, shows up and wants her to make more films. She gets mad at Matt so leaves with Kelly and Matt must convince her to come back. Then other twists include Kelly stealing some money and Matt must come up with a scheme to replace it. Let's just say it involves an almost porn shoot at the senior prom.It sounds like it would be really funny from a simple plot summary, but the laughs are far between. But there are a few, like when Matt gets a lap dance with his father's friend and Matt on ecstasy.FINAL VERDICT: I thought it would be better than it was. I only recommend it if you are wanting to watch an R rated teen flick.",5,1,2,5 April 2005
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," poor action flick
","This movie was not very good. From the acting to the special effects, it just did not fit. Since when does a prince, Dastan, hop around like spiderman. And the way the film depicts the time travel was funny. The guy is surrounded by fire and his spirit sort of looks on, just weird. And Jake Gyllenhall is miscast because he does not look middle eastern. Even the great Ben Kingsley could not pull off his poorly written character. Also, this is one of those films where the characters will be doing something and the next scene they are somewhere else and the movie doesn't explain it well.FINAL VERDICT: you can skip this",4,1,2,3 March 2011
Balls of Fury," this is one to avoid
","I thought this movie was horrible. It wasn't funny; it was boring. The lead character just wasn't interesting. And if you are going to use such a ridiculous plot; then it needs to be funny, and this wasn't. Maggie Q was the only interesting person in this; and mainly because I remember her from the last Die Hard movie. She even uses some of the same moves.I just didn't find ping pong appealing. Fighting to the death over ping pong; just didn't get it. Christopher Walken wasn't even too interesting in this.FINAL VERDICT: One of the worst films of the year.",2,2,5,12 August 2008
Ted," vulgar teddy and boring story....
","make for a lousy movie. The problem with this comedy was that it just wasn't funny, especially the first half hour, most of it is a narrator and it was just boring. Basically an outcast named John wishes his teddy bear were real and be his friend. Well it happens. Skip ahead to a 35 year old John with a girlfriend, Lori, of 4 years. The 2 live together with Ted, the bear. Ted likes to smoke pot and be vulgar. He's a bad influence on John and Lori's had enough. So you know what's coming next, the ultimatum, and you know Ted won't leave John alone for long. And there's this really gross side plot of Ted getting it on with a fellow cashier. And of course Ted has to help John win Lori back and there is the side plot of Ted's crazy stalkers. But the jokes weren't funny.FINAL VERDICT: A waste of time, skip it.",4,6,11,13 July 2013
Spider-Man 2," the plot really makes this something special
","Spiderman 2, while not oscar worthy(I don't know why some people are saying that), is certainly one of the better movies in the past 2 years, but I don't think it surpasses the first one. I liked the first one better mainly because we get to see how Parker first learns he's got superpowers and how he learns to use them. There were many funny scenes at the beginning and the first one had more action.  But, Spiderman 2 is just a hare behind, mainly because it is not as funny. I really liked the plot development. Because this is not just some action film with a bunch of explosions; the whole story revolves around Peter Parker and his crush Mary Jane.  The story is going some place and along the way Parker must deal with villians who terrorize the city and put those he cares about in danger.The sequel had less action, but the quality was much better. While watching Spiderman, I would sit there and think, that's just a computer Spiderman. But, in the sequel, it is hard to tell the difference between the person and the computer Spiderman. The whole bank robbery and fight scene while climbing a building was so amazing. Some how they made Doc Ock's arms look real while climbing and punching Spiderman. Then the other big fight scene happens at the top of a clock tower and on a train. It was some really neat stunts and just incredible CGI.Some other great scenes were when Peter tells Aunt May what really happened to Uncle Ben, the party scene between Harry and Peter, at the party when MJ tells Peter her disappointment with him, Spiderman in the elevator, and I could list many more.Also, the special effects with Doc Ock's arms were more than amazing. They looked so real at times. And I liked the explanation the movie gives as to how the arms actually think for  Dr. Ock.FINAL VERDICT: A must see.",Null,0,1,8 July 2004
127 Hours," a survival story with little action
","I thought this movie was OK, but I would have liked more action. It was more of a made for TV movie. Some how the writer made it stretch out over 90 minutes even though most of the film has Aron trapped by the boulder. To fill space, we are shown what Aron's thinking about, like drinking water and being free with family or friends. He also talks to his camera, filming what's he thinking. Aron is depicted as being some what cocky in the beginning. He seems to think he can climb rocks and go down ravines with ease and not be worried since he was by himself. I wonder if that how the real guy was. The only other characters are 2 girls he meets at the beginning and they go swimming in this cool water hole.FINAL VERDICT: Not enough oomph for me. I say skip it.",Null,3,6,14 September 2011
"I Love You, Man"," the concept sounded funnier than the actually movie
","This movie is about a guy, Peter, that is getting married, but he doesn't have any guy friends. His girl, Zooey, thinks he needs to meet some new guys. So he starts doing that and meets Sydney, a fun guy that he gets along with. Before long Peter is hanging out with Sydney all the time and it becomes apparent that Sydney doesn't have a lot of friends to hang out with because they all have relationships and he is still single. So by the end of the film, Peter thinks he has to 'break up' with Sydney, but Zooey makes it right in the end at their wedding.A lot of the jokes were dirty, it was sort of funny, but not super funny. I'm sure a lot of 20 year olds would like this, but it doesn't have broad appeal.Paul Rudd was good. He needs to star in more films.FINAL VERDICT: If you like American Pie type movies, then you may like this. It was OK.",5,0,3,19 January 2010
Finding Nemo," Great animation, but I think the plot gets too much praise
","I can't say enough about the animation.  It was so realistic.  The fish looked like they were solid, especially, Bruce the shark.  He 'felt' so much larger and like the shark actually took up space.  You see the seaweed swaying in the water, etc...  There's no telling how long it took to put together.With that set aside, I didn't think the story was that great.  It was OK, but definitely overhyped.  And I was expecting a lot of laughs based on other reviews, but I laughed once.  The story wasn't very original either. Rather than a friend searching for a friend, it's the dad going on an adventure to find his son.  Along the way, he gets help from an oddball. And since it's Disney, you know how it ends with lessons learned. 
FINAL VERDICT:  The story is OK, but the visuals are amazing.  It's worth at least one viewing.",Null,1,2,24 May 2004
Superbad," I'm Mclovin it
","This movie is very crude and crass with very frank language, but that's what makes it clever and better than recent films in this genera. The conversation the guys have about girls and dating sounded like something you would really hear close friends talk about in private. Things like that are what made it very funny. Seth and Evan are two high school seniors whom generally don't get invited to parties. But, Jules the girl Seth likes is having a party and after overhearing they have a fake ID to get alcohol invites them to her party. Their buddy Fogell, aka Mclovin, is the one with the ID, so the rest of the movie involves what happens when Mclovin goes to a liquor store to purchase alcohol and then their attempt to make it to the party. About everything that can go wrong does.The cops were a hoot. They take Mclovin to a bar, let him play with a gun, and drink on the job. I hope the real police don't act like that. And Seth and Evan have their own problems, they keep getting hit by cars and wind up at a party where cocaine is involved and get into fights.All 3 finally make it to Jules' party. Do Seth and Evan get the girls they pine for? Could this movie get any more vulgar? Watch to find out.FINAL VERDICT: If you think vulgar, crass teen films are very funny, then you will like this. I thought it was funny.",7,3,5,13 July 2008
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," was expecting better
","I thought this movie would be so much better. Now, I am glad I didn't pay to see this in a theater. Wolverine is my favorite character from the first X-Men movie, which I thought was great. So, I was expecting to really like this movie since it's all about Wolverine. Well, the story wasn't great and neither were the special effects. The coolest scene was already shown in the advertisements for the film, and that was when Wolverine escapes the water tank after just getting the transformation. And they really cheapened the death of Logan's girl at the end. That was lazy writing. Even the finally battle between Logan, Victor, and 'Wade' was no where near as good as the fighting scenes from X-Men. Also, it would have been nice to see Wolverine get his hands on Stryker before he lost his memory.FINAL VERIDCT: Disappointing.",5,1,4,29 March 2010
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," same basic romantic comedy formula: and it works!
","The last romantic comedy I remember Matthew McConaughey was in was the Wedding Planner with J-LO. That one was not very good because J-Lo and he had no chemistry and were boring together. This movie is different. Kate Hudson and him look so cute together, it's believable that they would fall for each other, but of course not in just 10 days.  I found a lot of things funny in this movie. MM has a bet to make KH fall for him while she is writing a story about how to get a guy to dump you.  She starts acting needy and clingy and that is when it gets good because any guy would dump a girl like that after 2 dates, but he can't because he needs to win the bet.  She brings over a love  fern, gets an ugly dog, brings over her bathroom stuff, and the  best part was when she brings over an album with pictures of their 'wedding and kids'.  The look on MM face was priceless.  Also this movie knows how to get a laugh out of the name Princess Sofie.  The ending is so predictable, but with these type of movies, does it ever end any other way?FINAL VERDICT:  I thought it was good and recommend it as your next chick flick to watch.",Null,1,2,20 April 2004
Alexander," Farrell not that great in this and the plot was too big...
","even for a three hour film. The story of Alexander the Great is an interesting one, but Stone begins when he is a young child and tries to fit all he can in 3 hours. I thought it made the film too broad and hard to follow in places since there are quite a few flashbacks. It would have been better, if the story had been narrowed. Maybe begin just as Alexander was named King and then follow him as he conquered the East.One question I have after seeing this was did every man in 320 BC wear eyeliner? Was eyeliner even invented then? And Jolie is as hot as ever but was it possible for a woman to have flawless makeup at this time? I was also disappointed with the battle scenes. They were too choppy and not that great. The battles in Gladiator were much better. The blood was flying everywhere, but you just couldn't tell much about what was going on.And the acting was not very good by anyone. I thought Farrell was pretty bad and I've liked him most of the movies he has done. And why did Jolie even bother with an accent. And she was the only one who tried to have an accent. We know they didn't speak English at this time, so why bother with fake accents.FINAL VERDICT: The story of Alexander that Stone wanted to tell would have been better if it was a 10 hour mini series on the history channel. He tries to tell to much in 3 hours, which makes the film seem disjointed with a lack of a central story. I don't think it was as good as Troy, and that wasn't that great either, so I don't recommend this one.",6,1,1,9 January 2006
Hot Fuzz," Murder improves a town???
","Does murder improve a town? Well if you've seen this movie,then you know the answer. This is another funny British film filled with blood and violence starring Simon Pegg. He plays a no nonsense cop, Angel, whom gets transferred to a small town. One of the first people he arrests is his partner. The town he goes to is known for having the lowest crime rates, but lots of accidents. Soon towns people beginning turning up dead in some very gruesome ways. Angel suspects murder, but some insists on calling them accidents. When the reporter has that steeple fall on his head, that was so gross, and funny in a very weird/wrong kind of way. They even played a little of the Omen music before hand.There's a lot of jokes throughout. It made for an entertaining film, but should have had a little shorter running time.FINAL VERDICT: Seemed a little different than a lot of films out there; made it more enjoyable. I recommend it.",6,3,6,10 March 2008
Constantine," plot too unfocused
","About half way through the movie, I started to get confused. I still don't know what the Spear of Destiny had to do with anything besides at the end when Angela almost gets stabbed with it. What was with the Mexican who found it. It was like he became possessed after finding it and then going to LA. But, why was he possessed and by who. Was it Satan? I don't know. And I didn't get Gavin Rossdale's character. Who was he supposed to be. First, I thought he was the son of Satan, but he bites the dust half way through. What was he trying to do? And what was with Gabriella. I thought she was an angel since she had wings, but she is seen at the same place as Balthazar and is trying to kill Angela.Then the part where Constatine holds Angela underwater in the tub made no sense. I get the near death experience part, but how did he know she would go to hell and not heaven. And why did he have to hold a cat when he sent himself to hell to look for Angela's sister. And how did Satan suddenly show up at the end? I could go on and on with more plot holes. But, I guess since this was based on a comic a ton of info got left out. And if you have never heard of the comic like me, the characters and what they do don't make a lot of sense.FINAL VERDICT: I thought it was too confusing, so I don't recommend it.",4,2,5,21 February 2006
The Others," a very chilling, jump-in-your-seat ghost story
","Without using a lot of special effects, this movie really creeps you out. It starts off slow, but that only increases the tension. I loved the big dark spooky mansion, and the way only small amounts of light were used to create a chilling atmosphere.  There were a lot of moments that made me jump.
The last 20 minutes is terrific the first time you watch it. I was leaning forward in my seat with my hands over my face saying WTF.  Nicole Kidman was really good in this.  Toward the end of the movie, I was scared for her and the kids.
FINAL VERDICT:  Very good. Don't read spoilers before you watch this. The twist at the end is very good.  Be sure to watch it in a dark room at night to get an even more thrilling experience.",Null,0,0,16 December 2002
Troy," a badly acted generic Hollywood action movie
","I'm glad I didn't pay to see this in the theater. Most of the reviews I read about it were correct; this movie isn't very good. I think it was made because of the huge success of Gladiator, but when it comes to acting Brad Pitt is no Russell Crowe. The main problem is the dialog and acting are bad, so you don't care what happens to the characters. And a story like the Trojan War is just too huge to tell in 150 minutes. Many of the characters mention the gods, but there is never time to explain who the gods were and how they played a role in the war. Basically, the writers just made up their own story, and the only way this is related to the Ilyad is it uses some of the same character names.Also, I was expecting some great war scenes that resembled Glaidator or Braveheart. Well, you don't get them in this film. The movie had 2 good fights. The best one between Achilles and Hector. The quick choreography and jumps used by Achilles looked cool. And the other good fight was when Achilles makes his way up the hill after his boat lands. But, the huge fights between both armies were boring.As I said, all the acting was bad, but if I had to pick who seemed most believable, it would be Eric Bana. Bloom's Paris was such a wimp and coward, I would think his father would have beheaded him because of the shame he brought from crawling away from his fight.And the romances in this film were so unbelievable. First that Achilles would hook up with a Trojan Princess and change his ways for her. His job is to kill and he's not going to change for some woman, plus he's introduced being surrounded by two naked women, so this one woman is going to make him fall in love. Then there's Hector and his wife. The movie tries hard to make us have sympathy for her and portrays him as being this great husband. In that time, weren't all woman treated as second class citizens and men had many lovers of both sexes.The movie also failed to explain the significance of Achilles being shot in the heel. I don't know the story, but there must have been one for Achilles to have been stopped by a couple of arrows.Now, to the best part of the movie, Brad Pitt's body. He's shirtless a few times and shows off his rear. This is the hottest he's every looked. So, if you like Brad, I would recommend watching it for a few select scenes.FINAL VERDICT: Pretty bad action movie. It's made worse by the acting because the actors are trying to play serious characters, but they are given a bad script to work with. You would never believe any of those people lived 3200 years ago. So, if you do watch this, watch it for one thing: Brad Pitt's abs.",3,2,5,18 March 2005
Just Go with It," much better than Adam Sandler's last attempt at comedy
","I thought this movie was OK. It had some laughs and I actually thought Jennifer Aniston was good in this. Plus, it has some beautiful shots of Hawaii. Brookly Decker doesn't need to quit her day job; not sure why they hired her as an actress. She looks way to young for Sandler. So Sandler plays, Danny, a plastic surgeon whom likes to lie about being married because he can get chicks easier. He has a hot assistant with two kids, Katherine, played by Anniston. Danny thinks he has found THE girl, Palmer, but still can't help the lies. The next thing he knows, he's pretending Katherine is his soon to be ex and he's the dad of her kids. The boy, Michael, wants to go to Hawaii to swim with dolphins and says this in front of Palmer. So now Danny can't say no and all of them plus his weird cousin, Eddie, are off to Hawaii. In Hawaii, Danny soon bonds with the kids and sees how much he depends on Katherine, so you know the ending.Nicole Kidman has a small part as Devlin, the girl Katherine can't stand and lies too and tries to outdo in a hula contest.FINAL VERDICT: This is a good pick for a fun movie and time waster.",Null,2,5,12 November 2011
Brokeback Mountain," OK, but not as good as all the award nominations suggest
","Obviously, the best part about this movie was the two leads were both hot guys in Hollywood. Jake G. is really turning into a hot comedy and Heath L. isn't bad himself. The story was interesting, but not that well written. The love story wasn't that moving. I've seen a lot better. The film used the controversy of 2 gay cowboys to get all the media attention it didn't really deserve.It would have been better if it had been under 2 hours. There wasn't enough material to fill almost 2 and a half hours.FINAL VERDICT: It's worth watching just because it's different than most films. Plus, the scenery of nature was beautiful. And the music was graceful as well.",6,1,19,28 November 2006
Orphan," wildest twist ending to any movie I've seen
","I actually liked this movie. Just from the title, you expect some movie about a demon child, but there was more to it. Married couple, John and Kate, decide to adopt a girl after loosing a child. They already have 2 other kids, Daniel and deaf Max. They adopt, Esther, a Russian orphan whom is very talented and articulate. She loves to draw and paint and wear ribbons around her wrists and neck. We learn why later in the movie.Soon, Esther starts causing problems between Kate and John and she always seems to be present around accidents. The nun from the orphanage tells Kate about Esther's past being linked to many accidents and her last family dying in a fire. Soon, Esther starts being really evil and manipulating Max. Evan after trying to burn Daniel alive, John still gives her the benefit of the doubt, but Kate is on to her and starts investigating Esther's past from Russia. That's when she finds out the very surprising twist, that is just creepy. Especially, when Esther is in black with all the heavy make up, you knew something was up.FINAL VERDICT: It had some good scares, I recommend it.",8,2,4,5 April 2010
Terminator Salvation," didn't even seem like part of the Terminator franchise
","This movie sucked. It was hard to tell it was even related to the Terminator series. The story and writing was horrible. They even had Bale saying 'I'll be back.' Was that supposed to be funny? Also, at one time they say that Kyle Reese is number 1 target of Skynet and John Connor was number 2. So how come the machines capture Kyle, yet don't kill him. And when Connor fights the t800, why doesn't the machine just bash his head in. The absolute worst fight. John Connor's wife served no purpose. Why didn't they just hire a no name actress for the role.Also, they made this film pg 13, taking away all the cool things the machines could do.FINAL VERDICT: A horrible sci fi movie.",3,2,4,26 April 2010
Insomnia," Entertaining
","This movie was better than a lot of flicks out there. Al Pacino is a cop from LA, who goes to Alaska, to help solve a murder. It is during the time of year, where it never gets dark there.  A steak out goes wrong and he shoots another cop but blames the killer they are after. The killer calls him and basically black males him into pinning the murder on another guy so he won't tell the cops Al really shot his partner.The acting is good.  And I liked how Al's character was getting more crazy as the movie went along because he couldn't sleep. You could say it was the daylight, but more likely it is his conscience that won't let him sleep. The killer, played by Robin Williams, meets up with Al and tries to say he killed the girl accidentally, but obviously, he's a little crazy.  Of course, the cop instinct finally overcomes Al and decides not to go along with the killer's plan and to take the blame for the shooting of his partner. Hillary Swank, the cop who admires Al, comes in at the end and plays a role in the final meeting between Robin and Al.FINAL VERDICT: Decent. I recommend it for those looking for a movie with a plot that that actually has a little individuality.",Null,0,1,14 May 2003
Aquaman," decent story and special effects
","Aquaman was better than I expected. While the special effects are out there, they do seem some what believable. All the sea creatures that are used for transportation was cool as well as the battle between Arthur and the Black Manta. The Black Manta seemed like a side plot that didn't need to be there, but I guess he will come into play with the sequel. I don't think the acting was very good, Jason Momoa and Amber Heard just didn't give much emotion and their 'funny' scenes fell flat. But you aren't watching this for the acting but for the action.FINAL VERDICT: One of the better Marvel films, it's a fun ride.",6,0,1,11 August 2019
500 Days of Summer," not enough drama for me
","I liked the way this movie was edited, with it showing the number of the days, going forward and then back in time. The clever scene where Tom attends Summer's party and its split screen with his expectations and reality.But, not enough happens in this movie. Tom gets Summer to go out with him. She says she wants it casual, but he really falls for her. She breaks it off and he's miserable for months after. Tom turns to his much younger sister to give the advice he needs.FINAL VERDICT: Slow paced, not a lot of action, but filmed in a unique style. Definitely a chick flick.",5,0,1,29 July 2010
Juno," why do people think a salty talking teen is so cool
","I thought this movie was OK, but nothing great. I'm not sure why so many think it is something special. It's about a salty talking teen whom becomes pregnant by her best friend. She just talks about it a crass sort of way, not really taking it seriously. She decides to put the baby up for adoption and picks an upper middle class seemingly happy couple. But, as it turns out they are not as happy as one thinks.A lot of the movie is Juno talking to her friends about various topics, not really much action or advancement of plot.FINAL VERDICT: It was mildly entertaining, but I don't think it was anything new. I'd say this film is more for teens.",6,4,11,11 November 2008
Concussion," interesting topic
","This movie was much better than I expected. I thought it was about a boring topic, but the movie made it entertaining. And I found Will Smith enjoyable for the first time in a long time. He was good and the accent was spot on. He plays a super smart coroner in Pittsburg who says NFL players killed themselves due to brain trauma. The government comes after him and the NFL wants to silence him. They even have a meeting but don't invite him and won't admit concussions can lead to brain injury. But he finally gets his voice heard.FINAL VERDICT: Well written, Will Smith is good, check it out. He deserved the acting nominations.",7,2,5,28 July 2016
The Day After Tomorrow," terrible story and already've been done special effects
","I'm glad I didn't pay to see this. When will they learn a bunch of computer special effects does not make a good movie. The basic plot is a scientist, Quaid, hypothesizes the earth's climate is changing and moving toward an ice age. But he never thought it would happen in a few days.At the beginning, there is a ridiculous scene in which Quaid jumps this chasm to get some metal rods. When he jumps back, he makes it with both feet landing right on the edge. It's beyond silly.Then there is a ridiculous subplot involving Quaid's ex-wife, who is a doctor. All the northern states are being evacuated but she says she will wait with a child who must be transported in an ambulance. And no explanation is given why the kid needs an ambulance; he's not hooked up to some breathing machine. So, you are telling me that kid was the only patient in the hospital that required an ambulance. What about the people in ICU! The other subplot is about Quaid's son, who is in New York City when the severe storm, that can kill people outside because of negative degree weather, strikes. He and some friends find refuge in the public library. A silly out-of-place romance is thrown in between the son and his classmate. But the worst part of all involves a pack of wolves that attack the group of 3 on a ship. 3 of them leave to find medicine for the girl who has cellulitis from a cut the director made sure of showing earlier in the movie. These wolves make their way onto the ship and give a good chase. It makes you laugh.Then Quaid goes with his two buddies to New York to rescue his son. Luckily for him, when the killing temps reach them, they happen to be over some store they can wait it out in. Plus, they must have had an extra warm tent. It was also funny when they mention Mexico letting Americans in because the US forgave all Latin American debt! The tornadoes were the best CGI effects, but tornadoes have been done so many times in other disaster movies. But, they only had one scene of natural disaster in foreign countries unlike movies before it. That's real original! Then the ending was horrible because it just stops with out a real resolution.FINAL VERDICT: This was a bad movie. Only watch it if you are looking for something so bad, it's funny.",3,14,33,6 April 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," too much filler, too long
","This was the first of the 3 pirate films I saw at the theater and it was a major disappointment. The first film was great and I thought the second film was very entertaining, although the creativeness from the first film had worn off. But this film was just too long and the plot drawn out to much. It had too many supernatural elements. The writers just made stuff up as they went along to try to solve the plot development. And the Kraken made one appearance, dead on the beach, and the film never said what happened.Since this was the third film, most of the jokes that were very funny from the first film, fell flat. Also with the long running time made this movie not as entertaining.The special effects were good just like in the first two.FINAL VERDICT: I'd definitely wait to watch this at home where you can stop it several times to get up. I'd only recommend it if you really want to know how everything ends for Captain Jack Sparrow.",5,0,4,4 June 2007
Spider-Man 3," I thought it was better than the second sequel but...
","still not quite as good as the first Spiderman. It's just not as funny as the first, but I liked the story lines. The movie had several so it kept you entertained. As expected, the special effects were great in this. Sandman may not have been visually as striking as Doc Oc but it was very well done. I liked it when he would just melt into sand. Jealously plays a big role in the story line. MJ is jealous of Gwen Stacy, a girl in Pete's science class, who gives a key to the city to Spiderman as well as a kiss. MJ gets back at Pete by hanging out with Harry more. And Gwen's ex, Eddie Brock, is jealous of her hanging out with Pete.There are 3 villains. Harry is the Green Goblin again and is out for revenge. He doesn't care that Pete is Spiderman. There is neat fight between him and Spiderman and he loses his memory for part of the film, so he and Pete become friends again.The Sandman is an escaped convict whom turns out to be the man who really shot Ben. So, of course Pete wants to hunt him down. Several great fights with Sandman. And then Eddie Brock turns into Venom by getting some of the black alien sludge on him. The sludge is like a parasite that takes over the host and influences aggression. It tries to do the same to Spiderman but on a smaller scale. Venom is cool and should have been in the film earlier.The way they get rid of Sandman was a little silly. Is he really gone, he could come back in a future sequel.FINAL VERDICT: Great superhero movie even if not the best in this franchise. It was still a lot better than Iron man, the superhero hit from the first part of 2008. Definitely a must see.",9,1,2,9 June 2008
Match Point," a soap opera turned into a feature film
","I'm not sure why this movie has gotten a lot of really good reviews. It was just fair. The plot comes right out of any daytime soap opera. A guy, Chris, starts dating a rich chick. He also likes her brother's finance,Nola, becomes obsessed with her. Nola breaks it off with the boyfriend and leaves town. Since Chris doesn't think he has a shot with Nola, he goes ahead and marries the other girl. He gets a nice job offer from her father and becomes content. But, then he runs into Nola again and starts an affair. It is the classic of husband telling mistress he will leave his wife nearly every day but never does. But Chris turns out to be smarter in the end than I thought he was. I thought he would never get away with it.But the whole plot was just too unoriginal. It wasn't worth being made into a feature film. Plus I didn't think the acting was anything special.FINAL VERDICT: OK, nothing to go out of your way to see.",6,1,3,17 November 2006

Resident Evil: Extinction," Still good for a third sequel
","I was quite impressed with this movie since it was the third sequel. It is still actually entertaining and good and the plot moves forward. One negative for me was the ending. It's set up for the next film with several hundred Alice's ready to kick Umbrella's arse. In this movie, it has been years since the T virus infected Raccoon City and it has spread wiping out the population and turning the land into a desert. Alice is traveling by herself avoiding Umbrella's spies. We also find out that Alice has mental powers now. Due to no transportation, she must join up with a caravan and convinces them that they should try to go to Alaska, where infection may not have spread yet. Only problem is they must look for fuel in Vegas.During this time Umbrella has tracked Alice and has a surprise waiting in Vegas. But the evil scientist gets bit in Vegas and injects lots of antivirus and the effects turn out pretty devastating. Alice decides they must get Umbrella's helicopter to get to Alaska and comes up with a plan. The remaining survivors get on the copter while Alice goes underground to take care of Umbrella.One problem I had was how could the zombies climb Eifel Tower yet thousands of them couldn't climb or knock down a wire fence. Also, when alice busts the fence down, she takes her sweet time in going down below. How come the zombies aren't running after her since the fence has a hole in it.The special effects were pretty good and the plot was interesting. It just wasn't a repeat of the previous films. And I liked the opening when I'm like isn't this the first film? And the way the mutant scientist dies after bragging I can't be killed was good.FINAL VERDICT: If you liked the first two, you will want to see this one. And with the ending, they have to make a fourth film.",7,0,1,6 July 2008
Midnight in Paris," why did this movie get such praise...
","I thought it was very mediocre approaching boring. Nothing exciting or funny or entertaining even happens. And I certainly didn't think any actor deserved an acting nomination in this. Owen Wilson plays Gil, a writer trying to write his first novel. He's in Paris with his finance and her family and they are seeing the sights. One night at midnight, he gets into this car and some how ends up in the 1920s; this part is never explained. So, he meets some of his favorite writers and artists, like Fitsgerald, Hemmingway, and Picasso. He also meets Picasso's girl,that he likes and this makes him see, he shouldn't marry his finance.And all this magic makes him want to movie to Paris, and he meets a new Parisan girl.

The Last Song," a drama that pulls on the heart strings
","This movie was much better than I expected. Mylie Cyrus is certainly no great actor but she does a believable job in this once she drops the tough girl act. She plays Ronnie, a girl whose been hurt by her parents divorce. She is very talented at playing the piano, earning a place at Juliard, but isn't sure if she will go since she hasn't played since her dad left. Ronnie and her younger brother, Jonah, are spending the summer with their dad at his beach house. Ronnie has no plans to make nice with her dad. She meets a cute guy, Will, that she blows off at first, but once she loses the tough girl act, they start dating.Then, as we suspect, we find out everything isn't so great with her dad and he is writing a last song for her. This is where the tear-jerker scenes come in. The movie certainly tries to be quite sad and everything gets wrapped up at the end.FINAL VERDICT: This movie is for fans of Cyrus and teen girls who want to see a sad romantic drama.",7,0,5,31 January 2011
Zodiac," too long for me
","This is one of several movies that have been made about the famous Zodiac killer. There's not a lot of action, mainly a character study. The movie focuses on 3 guys searching for clues about the Zodiac. One is a detective, one is an editorialist at the paper, and the other is a cartoonist at the paper, Robert Graysmith. The story centers around Graysmith as he seems to be obsessed more than any one and spends lots of time trying to decipher the Zodiac's codes. They come up with a prime suspect but are never able to get enough evidence to bring charges. The movie is based on a book Graysmith wrote.FINAL VERDICT: If you've seen another movie about the Zodiac, then you know what happens. This is nothing new. But, it is too long.",5,0,2,14 August 2008
Milk," boring biography
","I like biographies when the subject is interesting. I found this movie to be boring; it's just about politics. There is no action, no drama, just politics arguing for gay rights. Sean Penn does a good acting job, but I wouldn't have given him the Oscar because his character isn't interesting enough. And I agree with those that say they wish the first few minutes did not give away the ending. I knew nothing about Milk before seeing this, but after the movie's intro, you know exactly how it's going to end.The only real drama is a suicide but the ramifications of that is over with in a few minutes.FINAL VERDICT: Over 2 hours of boring politics. I say skip it.",4,7,23,27 October 2009
The Prestige," confusing ending, supernatural elements should never have been used
","I liked how this film shows you how some of the magic tricks are performed. It doesn't try to make the magicians look like warlocks. The centerpoint of the film is the dark rivalry between Angier and Borden. Angier blames Borden for the death of his wife during a magic trick and they become enemies. They try to one up each other. Angier is obsessed over Borden's Teleported Man trick. He must find out how it is done. He gets a new assistant that he falls for but sends her to Borden to discover the secret. However, she falls for Borden and this cause's Borden's wife to commit suicide. Angier goes to see a scientist and he invents a cloning box using electricity. This is where the supernatural elements come into play. Through a series of events, Borden is accused of Angier's murder and is sentenced to die. But, is Angier really dead? What about Borden? What was the secret to the Teleported Man? All of these questions are answered in a confusing ending, but the cloning part still doesn't make complete sense to me.FINAL VERDICT: OK, but I though it was difficult to follow and plus a little to long. The film jumps around a timeline and you have to think about what time frame the film is in.",6,0,2,12 August 2007
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," a lot of mindless action scenes, little substance
","There wasn't a whole lot I liked about this film. It just seemed like there would be some action, then filler, then action and so on. Not much of a story. What story there is centers about twins, a prince and princess. The prince is evil and is looking for 3 parts of a magical crown that when assembled gives the wearer command over the golden army, which is the most powerful supernatural army in the world.Hellboy is still working for the government and still with Liz, whom is given a silly side plot of being pregnant. The princess runs off with the third crown piece and seeks help from Abe, Hellboy, and friends. The prince tries to get it back, finally does and then there is a short sequence of what the golden army can do and then finally the final fight scene between him and Hellboy.Most of the movie is just mindless action, like with the giant plant, the huge monster at the troll market, etc... and it just gets to the point it is stale and bland. If they don't have a decent story, then sequels don't need to be made.FINAL VERDICT: Gets tiring to sit through the same fighting over and over. I don't recommend it.",5,4,7,16 June 2009
Silent Hill," a dreadful mish-mash
","I don't know anything about the video game and whether or not the movie follows the game. What I do know is this movie was terrible and the story didn't make sense.A woman, Rose, takes her 'weird' adopted daughter to Silent Hill, the name of the town the girl repeats while sleep walking. Some how the 2 along with a cop end up in some kind of alternate universe or maybe it was hell or somewhere in between. I don't know. It was never made clear. The husband goes to look for them and is in the same place the wife is but is in normal time. He can feel her presence but can't see her.The woman must battle the darkness and eventually a group of witch burners. The whole part about witches made little sense. What I think is maybe the woman and daughter are dead and are in a parallel universe before you get to hell. The witch burners are in hell paying for their sins. There is a girl Alessa who was killed by them and is out for revenge. She some how creates the darkness which is made of gross, evil creatures out to destroy. But I really have no idea if I'm right because it was not explained in the movie.The ending is weird. It's why I think the wife and daughter must be dead. They return home in the gray, ie. parallel world, and her husband is home, but they can't see each other.FINAL VERDICT: Just plain weird. Not scary and makes little sense.",2,0,3,23 March 2007
Hotel Rwanda," Good acting, interesting story...
","but not the best movie of the year. I've seen other movies about the conflict between Tutsi and Hutu in Rwanda. All were good. It would be hard to make a really bad film about such a powerful subject. The film focuses of Paul, a hotel manager at a swank hotel. It's where all the white people vacation and journalists gather. The genocide of the Tutsi breaks out and they seek refuge at the hotel. Paul is Hutu but his wife is not. He does business with other Hutus who help keep the hotel safe for a while. Paul tries to buy time by bribing soldiers with money and beer. He knows they all will be killed if forced to leave the hotel. The only thing keeping them safe is the hotel is not considered a refuge camp. But the Hutus who are committing murder on the streets know Tutsis are in the hotel. Paul is offered a chance to turn some over in order to get his family out but will not do it.Don Cheadle was very good. He uses a convincing accent. He must play a man who appears strong and in charge but really breaks down behind closed doors because he knows their chance of surviving is low.FINAL VERDICT: Good, compelling, but any movie about this subject would be. Good acting, Cheadle definitely deserved all the award nominations.",9,1,1,15 February 2006
The Hateful Eight," Pretty good but not one....
","of Tarantino's best. One of the biggest problems with the movie was it is too long and that was because there were scenes in which the dialogue just carried on way too long and it wasn't really funny or added too much to the story. Case in point, in the horse drawn buggy on the way to the cabin, there was just too much dialogue about Lincoln, etc... The best section of the movie was how it revealed whom poisoned the coffee. It showed how Daisy saw whom did it and then of course the violent deaths after drinking the coffee.I didn't think the ending was that great. Are we to assume no one made it?FINAL VERDICT: If you have plenty of time to devote, then it's worth a watch, even just for the Taratino style of film.",7,0,3,17 December 2016
We Were Soldiers," A very violent film with an OK story
","This movie was OK, but did seem way to pro American.  It just takes away from a story when they try to make it seem Americans are good while everyone else is so evil.The best scenes were the fighting scenes. We get close-ups of bullets entering people's heads, soldier's skin on fire, soldiers getting stabbed. They were very realistic.  Mel Gibson was good, but this movie made it seem like Col Moore was very calm and in control during the battle, but I don't that was true. I don't know how you could be in that situation with being surrounded by the enemy and greatly outnumbered. What I don't understand is why didn't they just bomb the hell out of the whole mountain when they learned that is where the enemy was.  Instead, they wait till they are completed surrounded before calling the code Broken Arrow.FINAL VERDICT:  If you like war movies, then you shouldn't miss this one.",Null,1,3,12 June 2003
Dear John," not that great of a love story
","The best part of this movie was Richard Jennings, playing John's autistic dad. He was the best actor in this and gave emotion to the film. Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried are not that good of actors and the chemistry was not there. I just don't call a movie with the actors reading letters out lead as being that much of a love story. The best parts were the dad telling Savannah about his coin collection. And after what Savannah did to John with just breaking up with him like that, I don't think John would ever get back with her. It just portrayed her as being cruel and insensitive. Also, in a small town like that, how could she not know that John's father had died.FINAL VERDICT: Just not that well written nor acted. The Notebook was much better. I don't recommend this one.",5,0,0,19 September 2010
Ocean's Twelve," where was the Heist?
","I'm glad I didn't pay to see this. I saw the first Ocean film and found it to be cleaver and very entertaining. This sequel had a terrible plot and was confusing. But seeing the Heist is what makes these types of films fun, and the Heist isn't really shown and only lasts a few seconds and was one of the most boring ideas I've seen.From what I could gather, the Heist occurred before the egg was even put on display. It was snatched by the thief of all thieves ( who happened to be Isabel's father) in order to prove a point to the Nightfox, another expert thief. He then allowed Ocean to make a bag switch on a train for the egg. So, the rest of the film was pointless. What I didn't get is why does Ocean allow himself and his gang to be arrested in the museum when he already knows it's a fake on display. Did he know all along that Linus's parents were cons and would get them released? Also, Bernie Mac was hardly in this, he sat in jail most of the film, so what was the point of him being there? And the whole idea of Julia Roberts pretending to be herself was silly. If that's the case, why not have Brad Pitt pretending to be Brad Pitt in order to get close to the egg.FINAL VERDICT: This film just wasn't clever. I expect to see a Heist during a heist film. And you don't get that in this. Don't waste your time with this.",2,2,4,14 November 2005
Crash," highly overrated by critics
","After reading some reviews on here, I see a lot of people didn't think much of this movie like me. It was movie critics that kept saying it was good. And the fact this won the Oscar for best picture, yet Saving Private Ryan did not, is a monumental wrong doing. This movie was not very good and certainly did not deserve any award nominations. Sure, it is about an important societal issue, racism. But that doesn't mean every movie about racism is good.This was like a hodge podge of several characters and their stories thrown together and at the end some of the characters overlap stories. We have 2 cops who detain a couple and one cop more or less molests the woman. Later, he saves her life and the other cop has a run in with her husband. We have 2 car jackers, later one runs into the other lady's husband and the other runs into the cop. It turns out he is the brother of another cop that was featured. Another story involves an Arab store owner who goes after a guy who only fixed the lock to his store. His daughter is a dr. who is scene later at the hospital.Then Sandra Bullock plays this whiny, rich b*tch who I could not stand. She didn't deserve any friends.FINAL VERDICT: Not very good. Not much happens. And definitely not one of the better movies of 2005.",3,9,17,4 April 2006
Spider-Man: Homecoming," why did marvel just forget about the comics?
","In this version of spiderman, it's like marvel just said screw the comics. We'll just make up a bunch of stuff. There is no Uncle Ben, and Aunt May is way to young. Peter isn't into photography. And where does Iron Man fit into a Spiderman movie. Also, since this movie is like a reboot with Peter back in high school and only 15, I would have liked to see the movie show how Peter developed his powers. The movie could have had Peter tell Ned the story of how he got spider powers in flashbacks. The story just pales in comparrison to the first Spiderman movie. I did like the Vultures costume and special effects with him. But Spiderman's suit is all gadetted out and I didn't think that ever happened.FINAL VERDICT: Not that great compared to some of the other Spidey films. The best part about the film was the jokes.",4,4,7,10 March 2018
Fast & Furious 6," the most ridiculous final sequence ever
","This movie was too crazy and silly to be any good. First of all, since it is the sixth film in the serious, you already know there is no plot. And then too many absurd things happen. Like Brian returns to LA to go to prison under an assumed name. His cop friend just gets him in a high security prison under a false name and then he meets the guy he was looking for, fends him and his goons off, and the next thing you know he's back on a plane to London. Yeah, sure. But the worst part of course is the ending and the plane. The action here is just too over the top. Cars hanging on a plane, people jumping out of a fast moving plane and landing in a car. Give me a break, they would have been on the runway. Then how long was this runway. And the plane explodes but Dom walks away with not even a tear in his wife beater. And how could Dom not have known to hide his sister, terrible.FINAL VERDICT: Stay far away from this.",2,4,7,17 May 2014
The Expendables," every 80s action film revisited
","This movie basically combines everything you can think of from every popular 80s action movie, including all the action stars and cheesy lines. This movie was written more like a comedy than action movie. It's definitely not to be taken seriously. Sly Stallion is the leader and he meets with Bruce Willis and Arnold Swartz. about a new mission. He takes the mission over Arnold, whom I think mentioned something about him being in the jungle(Rambo, get it). They go to this island whom has been overtaken by an evil general and his American drug-lord. So, Sly must save the general's daughter, put an end to the general, and then give the drug-lord what he deserves.

Scary Movie 2," Ya gotta love the baby arm
","I hated the first Scary Movie, but I actually liked this sequel. It wasn't as gross as the first one.  Sure, some of the jokes don't work, but it still made me laugh.
(SPOILERS):  Chris Elliott was funny because of the whole baby arm gags. It was so funny at the dinner table when he kept sticking his 'little hand' in all the food, grossing everyone out.  The opening scene with James Woods was funny too.  It was pretty good when Cindy gets into the fight with the black cat.  And the way Brenda deals with the skeleton is a riot. I even liked it when Shorty gets smoked like a joint. That was a funny sight gag.(END OF SPOILERS)
FINAL VERDICT: Better than the original. It's got a short running time, so even if you don't think it is so great, you only lost 83 minutes of your life.",Null,0,1,18 August 2002
Pan's Labyrinth," original tale of fantasy and reality
","This movie was definitely better than most. It was quite entertaining. It has some cool special effects, esp. the fawn. Even though it is like a fairy tale, it is rated R for a reason: not for kids. This is a very violent and bloody movie. The scene with the captain beating a man to death in the head was one of the most gruesome scenes in film history. It was worse than what they show in your average slasher flick. Ofelia travels to live with an evil Captain with her pregnant mother who has married the captain. She finds a fairy who leads her through a labyrinth to a mysterious fawn. He tells her she is a princess who must complete three dangerous tasks in order to find immortality. While this is going on, we learn her mother is very ill plus rebels are fighting the soldiers and 2 people in the Captain's household are part of the rebellion. Ofelia also disobeys the fawn and gets into some trouble of her own.The whole film just has a creepy feel to it; plus it has some very violent scenes. It was just very original. Also the subtitles take nothing away from the film.FINAL VERDICT: If you like gory movies, this is for you. Reading the subtitles is not bad. Check it out.",9,1,6,21 August 2007
Final Destination 2," You already know the whole plot to the film...
","but what makes it fun to watch are the gruesome deaths.  We have a guy who gets the end of a ladder in the eye, a boy crushed by a glass window, a women's head caught in elevator doors, new meaning to airbags are dangerous, and a flying wire fence that literally leaves a guy in  pieces.  Plus, a couple of deaths at the end, which aren't near as thrilling.  It certainly won't make you use any brain cells.  But, the film delivers tension since you are wondering when and how the next gory death will happen.FINAL VERDICT:  If you like blood and gore like me, then you will want to catch this film.  You could just fast forward to the death scenes and you won't be missing anything.",Null,0,1,8 February 2004
Blade II," Exceptional visual style
","I love the way this movie was edited and the camera angles used.  It was very cool the way the camera followed Blade as he jumped in the air and did flips.  This sequel also has quite a bit of blood and gore for the horror fan.  The special effects were great concerning the reapers mouths. And the fight scenes were good; my favorite was when the girl and guy vampire invade Blade's territory and they fight with pipes. One thing I didn't like was the cliche Rave/Party scene. Just leave that out next time.  And the way Blade seemed so protective over the girl vampire. I mean why, vampires are his enemy and just because one's a girl he automatically feels a connection with her. I just didn't get that.FINAL VERDICT:  The plot won't burn up any brain cells, but it is very visual appealing.  I definitely recommend it if you like action and/or visual effects movies.",Null,0,1,21 April 2003

","of all the great reviews I heard about this film when it was in theaters. I thought it was OK, nothing great. I hardly laughed, but it was amusing.

She starts chatting up Ben and takes him home. One thing leads to another and 8 weeks later discovers she's knocked up. So, she must contact Ben again. She realizes she is having a child with an overweight, non-working, pot smoking, mid-20 year old loser. But for the sake of the child she decides to get to know Ben and they date. She soon thinks they won't work out because he does drugs, doesn't have a job, etc... But, Ben wants to make it work so shows enthusiasm and wants to make changes.There is subplot between Alison's sister and her husband.

Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," not a fun musical
","I have been a big fan of recent musicals; however, this one goes away from the norm, and it's just not as fun. The music and lyrics aren't as good. While visual, Sweeney Todd is quite spectacular with the dark sets and moonlit lightning. However, musicals like Moulin Rouge had much better costumes and visual effects.Johnny Depp was only OK; he isn't a great singer. This movie was fairly violent. Lots of blood squirting from gashes. The mince meat pies were more in the background and that idea could have been worked in better in the movie. I just felt the script could have been written better.FINAL VERDICT: OK, but disappointing as far as musicals go. I only recommend it for Depp fans.",6,0,0,11 November 2008
Blades of Glory," the dirty side of figure skating
","This movie exploits the dirty side of figure skating so to speak. It's entertaining and amusing. Not a great comedy, but certainly good enough. Will Ferrell plays his usual character stereotype. Jon Heder plays Jimmy, the rival to Ferrell's Chazz. Both get kicked out of men's figure skating after a funny series of events. They both get loser jobs. Jimmy's coach comes back into the picture, and they come up with the idea of pairs skating. Jimmy can't find a girl in time, so he takes Chazz as a partner. Of course, hijinks ensue, since the two can't stand each other. The Van Waldenberg's are the leaders in pairs figure skating and they do all they can to sabotage Chazz and Jimmy. The funniest scene of the movie is when Jimmy calls Katie to ask her out for a snow cone. Chazz tells Jimmy what to say and Katie's brother and sister tell her what to say. That was so funny.FINAL VERDICT: This movie is like any Will Ferrell movie, so if you like his other films, you will like this one.",7,1,2,23 March 2008

","I didn't care for this movie. I didn't find it funny. Even Jack Black couldn't make this movie entertaining. I found it boring. Jack Black plays Nacho, a worker in a monastery, who becomes a wrestler to raise money to feed the orphans and provide improvements to their lives. The wrestling scenes are not funny and neither is Black's weird accent. The side kick was OK, but that is all I liked about this movie.The hot nun adds little to this.

The Town," heist movie with a good story line
","This movie was above your average heist movie because the characters are a little more developed and the culture of their Boston neighborhood are brought into the movie. It is more than just watching how they are going to pull off the ultimate robbery. Doug is the head of the gang. He's smart and not a hot head like James. You know James' impulsiveness is going to come back and bite them in the bud.So, they take a bank employee, Claire, as a hostage and decide to follow up and make sure she doesn't know anything. Doug ends up starting a relationship with her, but she doesn't know he was one of her robbers. As the movie goes along, the cops are getting closer as the gang continues to pull off robberies. The ending was neat with Doug surviving a seemingly impossible situation and helping Clarie in the end. However, I think the police would be very suspicious about a large cash donation being made in Doug's mother's name. I would think that cash would be confiscated by the police.FINAL VERDICT: Check it out.",Null,0,0,2 August 2011
Underworld Awakening," too much shooting and not enough plot

The werewolves looked like bad CGI, they could have looked a lot more real.In this film, Selene is caught and it's 12 years later. Subject 2 releases her and she finds herself in a lab. Humans have removed most of the vamp and lycon problem. She escapes and finds Subject 2, a young girl she has a special connection too. She protects her as the lycans want her too for her special powers. So, the movie is just a shoot between Selene and wolves and people.

Closer," a movie about 4 cheaters...
","isn't a great idea in my opinion. All of the characters stoop pretty low and you don't care if any of them find happiness. Dan has a much younger girlfriend, Alice. He's in love with Anne and cheats on Alice. During this time, Anne gets a guy, so she's cheating also. Everyone admits to each other about the cheating. It's clear none of them really no what love is, they just covet.The hokiest scene is the web chat in which Dan pretends to be a woman and gets Larry to meet him somewhere. And it just happens that Anne is there, so that's how she meets Larry. That coincidence wouldn't happen in a million years.Then Larry must be the most pathetic person because he still wants Anne after she tells him she's been cheating with Dan for a year. He doesn't care. That is just gross and that is right after he tells her he cheated on her on a business trip.Then in order to get Dan to do something, Anne turns into a whore. I could go on with what disgusting things these 4 people do, but I'll stop here. Like I said, you could care less if these people are happy.FINAL VERDICT: Boring, all 4 characters are pathetic and tasteless. I don't recommend it.",2,2,3,4 October 2005
Suicide Squad," not a good plot
","This is one of the poorer films based on comics. The biggest problem is the villain, the Enchantress, was stupid. She doesn't do much till the end. And as for the squad, Deadshot was the best character and actually had a talent that would be helpful in combat. Exactly what did Harley Quinn do that was so special that she would be useful in taking out a witch. How about nothing. She is just there for one-liners. The make-up/costume for the Croc was cool, but Croc hardly did anything. And Boomerang guy didn't have a special talent. Diablo had the best gift and him and Deadshot were the only ones worthy to be selected for the special task force. And then thrown in all this was the Joker, whom just shows up time to time.

One question I had why does Buddy act like a stupid 12 year kid just because he was raised with elves? None of the other elves act like they fell off the turnip truck.And I thought the singing of Christmas carols toward the end was so hokie.

I mean, when Teddy keeps seeing visions of a dead woman, and we are told there is a missing patient, it doesn't take much to put two and two together.The gist of the film is 2 federal marshals go to Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a patient from a mental asylum. The boss, Teddy, asks a lot of questions, but doesn't get a lot of answers. The story he is told makes it seem impossible for the patient to have vanished from her cell.

Capote," boring subject
","I admit, I know nothing about Truman Capote, so I found this movie to be completely boring. Sure Hoffman did a great acting job, but since I have never heard anything about the real life Capote, I can't compare his acting performance to the real thing. I know his voice was very annoying and difficult to understand because it was so soft. At the end, it is mentioned Capote died from alcoholism, which explains why he is with a drink in hand during most of the film. He even adds alcohol to what looks like applesauce to eat. The Kansas murders weren't a mystery because the police catch the killers fairly soon after the incident. Most of the story revolves around Capote interviewing the town folk and killers for his novel. So, as you can see, there isn't a lot of action or plot twists, so it makes for a boring story.FINAL VERDICT: I only watched it because Hoffman won the Oscar. Yes, his acting is very good, but the film overall is not. It's not worth seeing.",Null,1,4,17 February 2007
Life of Pi," great special effects, but felt cheated by the ending
","I thought this movie was OK. The special effects were great. All the zoo animals and then the tiger in the boat, and all the meercats, all of it looked so real. And it is hard to tell a story about a guy stranded on a boat, but the story had enough to be entertaining. I was hoping the tiger would be more grateful at the end. I liked all the shots of underwater from under the boat, with the fish and all. And the ship sinking had good effects too.What I didn't like is at the end when Pi has to tell his story to the insurance people and he has to tell a different version minus the animals. It's basically saying everything you watched was a lie. I felt cheated.FINAL VERDICT: Worth seeing for the visuals.",6,1,5,27 August 2013
Ocean's Thirteen," While better than the second sequel....
","this was still no jackpot. The movie offers nothing new and the conn is difficult to follow in the beginning. I was confused as to what was going on. You need to watch it twice to follow how they are setting up the casino. I liked it better the second time watching it because it made sense then. But any movie you have to watch twice just to understand what is going on is not what I would call good movie. This time around Danny and his gang are after Willy Banks. Banks two timed their friend Rueban causing him to have a heart attack. So, they want payback by sabotaging Banks' casino opening. Their plan is to rig all the games so everyone is a winner. Then to get all out of the door before they gamble the winnings back to the casino. Rigging slots, craps, roulette sounds impossible right; well not when you are super cool George Clooney and Brad Pitt. They also must find a way to snatch Banks' 5 diamond necklaces worth 1/4 billion.All the players are back except Julie Roberts and Catherize Zeta Jones. Ellen Barkin and Al Pacino are the new addition to the cast. They were OK.The conn just didn't seem spectacular, nor was there a lot of action.

There was hardly any range to his character considering all he does is shoot alcohol commericals and follow Charlotte around in Tokoyo.  Clearly this movie got hype because of who Sofia's daddy was.

The old woman steal's the girl and keeps her hidden in a tower, where Rapunzel grows very long hair and the woman uses it to stay young.On her 18th birthday, Rapunzel wants to leave the tower to see the sky filled with lights.

Once the old woman finds her gone, she starts to track the 2. So, Rapunzel finds all that she's been missing in the world and well you guessed it, learns her mother was keeping her hid for her own selfish reasons.Along the way, there are cute scenes and a couple of good songs.

We Are Marshall," I'd rather watch a documentary on this subject
","To me, this movie just didn't have much happen in it; hence, it was boring. An hour long documentary on the plane crash and what happened at the university would have been more interesting. I don't buy Matthew McConaughey as a football coach. He looks too much like a surfer dude, and dying his hair dark isn't going to change that. Also, this movie at over 2 hours is way too long for so little action. The crash takes place in the first 10 minutes or so, so we barely learn anything about those who died. Therefore; it doesn't make that great of an emotional impact later in the film when the team is trying to come together for its fallen teammates.FINAL VERDICT: I like sports and sports movies. But this one just didn't do it for me. I don't recommend it.",4,6,14,9 January 2008
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," well acted but the story goes no where
","I don't get why this movie has gotten so much praise, yeah, it's OK, but slow with a very boring plot. Only the acting can keep your interest for nearly 2 hours. This was more like a hallmark TV movie. Basically, Mildred, decides to put up billboards criticizing the work done by the police in her daughter's murder. In a flash back, we see she carries a lot of guilt because of the last conversation she had with her daughter, but that part is never expanded upon. So of course, people in town get on her back, because the sheriff, Willoughby, is well liked and dying of cancer. She gets a lot of threats and her son gets picked on, but she won't take down the billboards. One side plot which I didn't get why it was thrown in, was Willoughby gives his family a special day, then kills himself. I don't get why that was thrown in. Also, Dixon, one of the 'bad' officers but depicted with a heart of gold at the end, beats up the advertising guy, and doesn't go to jail. Instead, he nearly dies at the police station when Mildred sets it on fire. Only to team up with her at the end for vigilante justice. So out of character. So she just leaves her only child left to go hunt someone down; you'd think her son would be her number one priority. It was like just a mesh-pot of story lines thrown in to make a nearly 2 hour run time.FINAL VERDICT: Just don't go in expecting some kind of murder mystery or action packed. Just regular people doing some dirty things to others because they think they have the right to revenge instead of dealing with their problems and grief.",4,2,4,11 August 2018
Pacific Rim," action packed
","This movie was like another version of Transformers, this time with alien/sea monsters doing the attacking. The aliens, aka Kaiju, have come from the ocean instead of the sky; There is a breach that leads to another dimension. And for some reason, the Kaiju only come 1 by 1 and months apart instead of sending in a whole bunch at one time. How does that make sense? You attack with numbers. And ways as you can see this movie requires the viewer to suspend a lot of common sense in order to enjoy.Humans have built giant 'Transformers', aka Jaeger, to battle the aliens. It takes 2 people to operate the Jaeger. So our hero, Becket, has lost his brother in battle and gets recruited again for one last attempt to stop the Kaiju. He goes to Hong Kong where there are only 4 Jaeger left. Some Kaiju show up and we get another big battle. The general has a plan to end it all by blowing up the breach.Overall, it was a good action flick if you overlook the loop holes in the story and all reality. The special effects were really good, which is what made the film.FINAL VERDICT: a good choice for a popcorn flick",6,0,1,18 April 2014
American Sniper," great story about...
","a real person. The movie is about Chris Kyle, a guy whom was a navy seal and had the highest total of sniper kills in the middle east. It follows him through a few tours and what his life was like when he came home. He was married and had a couple of kids, but was more concerned about America. When he finally gets out, it shows how his mind was still messed up from what he had experienced but was trying to get better when he died.The best part of the movie was the war scenes that were shot very well. You get a feeling of what it would be like to be a sniper sitting on top of a building. Soon, that's not enough for Chris and he wants to be involved in the more dangerous door to door. Also toward the end there is an exciting shooting scene where Chris completes the main objective but the group's position is compromised and they must get out with a huge sand storm moving in.FINAL VERDICT: Definitely one of the better films in the past several years. Check it out.",8,10,13,6 October 2015
The Devil Wears Prada," if you're a New Yorker...
","you may think this movie is great or if you are in to high fashion. Otherwise, it is difficult to relate to people who think having the latest Chanel boots or Valentino dress is of the utmost importance. I don't live in New York or go to fashion shows, so I didn't think the story was all that entertaining. Plus, I was expecting more comedy, but this movie is pretty much a straight forward drama. Plus, I don't like how they take the lead actress, Anne Hathaway, and continuously describe her as fat and hideously dressed. I mean, she is an actress, so is quite good-looking, but not skinny as a model. I think that sends a bad message to 12 year old girls who will watch this.Streep was great as Miranda Priestly, the tough nosed editor and boss who requires her assistants to do the impossible. Any one who could survive her could handle any job. I was disappointed in that Miranda never really seemed to change to be a little kinder in the end. I kept expecting that to happen. And I didn't like how Andie basically let her boyfriend go like that and hooking up with the first guy she meets in her new circle of friends. And Andie even lets all the high fashion get to her and starts acting like it is so important. So, I guess I was expecting the lead character, Andie, to be more sympathetic, but she wasn't.FINAL VERDICT: It was OK, but it is definitely a drama and doesn't really have comedy thrown in. I recommend it only if you like Anne Hathaway or want to see all the cool clothes people wear in this.",5,0,0,10 July 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Nothing special
","Episode II was better than Episode I, but that doesn't really mean to much considering how bad Episode I was.  AOTC was just your average summer movie with a bad plot and VERY BAD dialogue.  I mean, it seems like the actors half to pause before delivering the next line.  There is no flow in conversation, but then again most of the characters don't have anything meaningful to say.  Example, when Sam Jackson says 'The party is over.' Did a 5 year old write that?
I really didn't think the acting was as bad as many people seem to think. I think the dialogue was what made the actors seem so bad.  Hayden Christensen is no Bob Diniro, but I don't think he was that bad. I thought Sam Jackson had the worst performance.
I was highly disappointed in the Yoda/Dooku fighting scene after hearing about how good it was supposed to be.  I mean, what did it last maybe a minute.  And all Yoda does is jump around and do little flips in the air.  I thought the Dooku/Obi Wan fight was better.
Also, there are too many CGI monsters and backgrounds.  The big battle scene in the coliseum was a poor rip off from Gladiator.  I mean, all those CGI monsters just look to fake and all the robots running around, you can't pay attention to anything because there is too much on the screen at the same time.
FINAL VERDICT:  If you want to see a good summer movie, watch Spiderman. You will only like AOTC if you are a Star Wars geek, so don't waste your money at the theater on this.",6,0,2,9 June 2002
Gone Baby Gone," entertaining kidnapping mystery
","This movie was above average. I liked it and didn't guess the twist at the end. My only complaint is some of the bad language could have been left out. I don't think is was necessary. A woman hires two investigators to help the police with the disappearance of her niece. The child's mother is a drug addict and liar. The PI put together clues and figure out what happened to the child. It's over drugs and money and work out a plan to get the kid back. But things go wrong. It's several months later and one of the PI, Patrick, gets a lead on another case about a molester. He does something shocking and figures out the case with the little girl may not be completely over based on a conversation with one of the cops. It has a nice twist ending at the end as to what really happened.I thought the story had some unique qualities and the acting was good.FINAL VERDICT: Worth watching, just not for kids.",7,0,0,13 August 2008
"Monsters, Inc."," Funny and creative
","This film had really cool, imaginative animation.  Plus the plot was entertaining.  I liked the idea of children's screams powering Monstropolis, cute and funny.  The little girl, Boo, had such a funny, little laugh.  I liked how all the monster characters had their own personalities.  From the striking colors to the way the hair moved on Sully to the snow blizzard, the CGI was great.   I also liked the expected chase scene because it was  a little different in this movie. Here, Sully, Mike, and Boo travel through doors and come out in different places and out of different doors as they are being chased by the evil Randall as they search for Boo's door.  I just really liked the uniqueness of these scenes.  Also, the final scene was touching, and we get to see how Sully's character transform from a scarer to someone who just wants to make kids laugh. 
FINAL VERDICT:  I highly recommend this for kids as well as adults. It is entertaining, cute, and funny.",Null,3,4,10 March 2003
Ant-Man," super hero movie with some comedy
","Finally, a super hero movie with some comedy and it worked. Normally, I don't like the super hero movies because it's just too much non-sense and silly special effects, but this movie was not over-the-top and most importantly added comedy to keep things moving.Scott Lang has recently got out of prison, but is pulled back in by a cannot pass up robbery, which turns out to be a set up. Dr. Hank Pym has picked him to try this suit he's invented, that shrinks the wearer and turns him into a ruler of ants.The villain is another scientist whom worked with Pym and is trying to create a machine to shrink living things. Of course, he wants to use it to take over the world.We get a few scenes with Lang learning to use the suit and control the ants. At the end he must break into the lab and stop the mad scientist.FINAL VERDICT: One of the better super heros films. Check it out.",7,0,2,8 April 2016
21 Jump Street," rude and crude
","This movie has nothing to do with 21 Jump Street, except to use the title. It's one of those wanna be comedies that uses cussing and perverted jokes to try to be funny. I don't find these type of movies that funny. And this movie was not funny. It was just ridiculous. Showing someone acting silly while taking a deadly drug is just a cheap way to try to get laughs. Sure it is cute when they are on drugs and the teacher's head turns into an ice cream cone, but that is just childish humor.The only redeeming scene is when Johnny Depp makes his cameo. Also Ice Cube lives up to his tough persona in this.FINAL VERDICT: what a waste",3,2,7,5 November 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," boring superhero movie
","I didn't like this at all. At least Thor was pretty good and had an excellent beginning. There wasn't anything I liked about this movie. First Chris Evans is not a lead actor. If I saw him in a commercial, I wouldn't know who it was. Second Captain America doesn't have any cool weapons or abilities. All he does is throw a shield around like a boomerang and can jump really high and long. Most of the story was just boring as it showed Steve Rogers joining the army, getting transformed into a big guy, then he goes around the country raising money. Over half the movie is about this.Then the bad guys are the Nazis, with the leader being a guy with a red head and no nose. He doesn't have any cool abilities either, just some neat gadgets like a gun that makes people disappear.FINAL VERDICT: The whole was just terrible. Not worth your time.",2,2,4,5 May 2012
American Hustle," considering all the pub...
","I was expecting it to be better. I thought this was fair, but there have been better movies made about the fbi, mob, and swindlers. And this movie clocks in at over 2 hours, so if you devote the time to see it, pay attention; otherwise, some of it won't make sense.You have Irving and Sydney scamming people out of money. The fbi come in and agent Richie gives them a deal. Help the fbi bust some dirty players, and they will get off scot free. So they get mixed up in politicians, bribing senators, and the mob. They are wearing wires to try to get money exchanging hands. Then you have Irving's wife thrown in for sex appeal since she just wears low cut tops. So I guess the big twist is, will Irving give up the mob and possibly risk retribution. Will the plan work with the fbi so he gets out of prison? The acting was OK, nothing great and the plot seemed stale. It's been done before.FINAL VERDICT: It's long, drawn out, I recommend it only if you are big fan of one of the actors in it.",6,1,3,12 August 2014
The Bourne Ultimatum," Plot makes sense but still not that engaging
","I have not been real impressed by the previous Bourne movies, and this one was no exception. The best part of the movie was that the plot actually made sense this time and could be followed. Most of the action is car chasing scenes. And there are a few and they are shot very well. They look realistic. Bourne also gets to engage in hand combat with another asset and that was some fight. Nicky Parsons shows up again and is involved a little with the plot then just gets on a bus and leaves. What was the point in that? Bourne goes from Europe to America searching for his identity and what happened to him. He finds out some surprising answers and gets revenge on those in charge.FINAL VERDICT: It wasn't anything great, but I'm sure if you liked the other Bourne movies, you will want to see this.",6,6,10,10 September 2008
Rush," fast cars, interesting rivalry
","I don't care for car racing and know nothing about Formula 1, but I thought this movie was OK. There were lots of race scenes and they were shot well. It gave the feeling of seeing these cars race at hundreds of miles per hour plus you got a feel of what it was like from the driver point of view.So the film is about a rivalry between 2 guys that first met at Formula 3 races. Then they move up to the big time, and are in a heated battle for the most points. Lauda is the more serious and trying to get points taken away for breaking rules. Hunt is the party boy whom is competitive and more lax. During the racing season, Lauda gets hurt and brings drama as this lets Hunt get back in the race for point leader. Lauda has already one the top spot before, so Hunt has real drive and risks his life to win.There is also a little about each drivers' wife and how their personal relationships functioned.FINAL VERDICT: The acting isn't too great, but the racing scenes are. Plus Chris Hemsworth is very good looking in this. So if you like fast cars, check it out.",6,2,6,12 August 2014
The Aviator," not best picture material
","Since this got a lot of award nominations, I thought it would be better. It was OK, but too long. There is so much to tell about Howard Hughes; you can't do it in one film. And this movie stops when he was still fairly young. We don't see him in his later years when he was really nuts.The lesson to this movie, if you let unstable people have a bunch of money, then they are going to do some crazy things. Hughes throws money around to build his dream planes and to make movies that aren't very good. According to this movie, his biggest enemy was Pan-Am, who was trying to keep TWA from flying overseas.Also, the movie shows a lot of his girlfriends, many of whom were famous actresses. It never dwells to deep into his personal relationships though. I'm sure there were many more interesting things about them.FINAL VEDICT: It was OK, not great. And we learn Hughes sure loved his bar of soap. If you're into biographies then you'd probably like it; otherwise, I would skip it. Also Leo is sort of hot in this, but they have to make him look crazy in some parts. So, it isn't the best film to Leo watch.",7,29,56,30 December 2004
Oblivion," Tom Cruise just doesn't have 'IT' anymore
","I've really lost interest in Tom Cruise. His movies just aren't that good anymore and he does way to many sequels, ie..Mission Impossible. The idea behind this sci-fi movie didn't seem very unique. Basically, you have Jack whom is left on earth with Victoria and they are in charge to defend these water tower type things from alien scavs. Other humans have gone to live on one of Saturn's moons. They talk to this woman whom is supposedly in a space station and is overseeing their job. One day Jack finds a woman, Julia, in space capsule and he knows her. Then that's when the plot just gets too crazy and it makes no sense. Some how, Jack is a clone and the scavs are humans and aliens are steeling earth's resources, and no one is on Saturn's moon. All of it got too convoluted for me.FINAL VERDICT: Skip it, the plot and the actors aren't up to par.",3,0,3,14 January 2014

",seemingly have nothing in common. The basic story is the Cox's are getting a divorce. Osbourne Cox just got fired from the CIA and is writing a book. He loses his CD that contains his rough draft at the gym. Two gym employees think it is a CD filled with top secrets. First they blackmail Osbourne for cash unsuccessfully; Then they try to sell the info to the Russians.All of these circumstances lead to some very unfortunate events in everyone's lives.Some of the funny points are Linda just wants the cash for multiple plastic surgeries to help her image at the gym. She uses online dating and that's how she meets Harry. It just happens that Harry is also having an affair with Osbourne's wife and is being followed by the CIA. The CIA has no problem with disposing of bodies. It's too bad about the hatchet and the gym manager. I could go on and on because there were so many amusing events.FINAL VERDICT: Very entertaining film. I recommend it.,8,2,6,7 July 2009
The Bourne Identity," Slow plot but good fight scenes
","I really like the fight scenes with Matt Damon. He shows some really cool moves as a trained assassin.  The story was OK, but it does drag in parts. And I really didn't like the lead actress. I don't think she and Damon had much chemistry and they didn't do a lot together, so I didn't buy them falling in love on their short adventure together.  The car chase scene was OK, but there just wasn't anything special about it. Plus, we knew Damon would get away at the end since it was in the middle of the movie.  Of course, it does have some things that don't make sense. Like why bother trying to kill Jason Borne if he has no memory of what he did.  And then they let him go in the end. Why not finish the job?  Plus what was going on at the CIA never made much sense.FINAL VERDICT:  The best part of this movie is the hot Matt Damon. Too bad he didn't have several scenes with no shirt.  There are some cool hand to hand combat scenes, but the whole story seemed more like a made for TV movie. I don't know how it could have cost $75 million to make.  I recommend it if you like spy movies or Matt Damon, but if you like really fast paced movies then you may want to skip this.",Null,0,1,25 June 2003
The Italian Job," not inventive enough
","In the past couple of years, I've seen much better heist films, like Ocean's 11, the Heist, and the Score.  Those were much better and had better double crossing plots.  This movie was rather boring with the best part being the robbery of the gold and the neat idea of getting it out underwater.  Also, the scene where Charlie slugs Steve at the table was good.  But, I didn't think much of the Mini-Cooper chase. It wasn't that great or original.  And there wasn't that twist at the end where someone you thought was good or bad is exactly the opposite.FINAL VERDICT:  I like smart, somewhat funny, last robbery job movies. But, this one wasn't that good, so I don't recommend it.",Null,2,4,27 July 2004

","The best part about this movie was the dark humor and one liners. It just worked. And I loved the character of Baby, it just works you have this quiet guy listening to music and he can do all these cool tricks with a car. Spacy was good as the ringleader in all this. Not only were the car chase scenes excellent, but the on the foot scenes well shot too. Some parts I still don't get. Like why did Baby slam on the gas and run into the back of the truck on the last heist. It's like he wanted to give up but then he ran. And I don't think he should have gone back the waitress while on the run. He knew what would happen. Just look over some of the plot holes.FINAL VERDICT: Super fun robbery film with some humor. Definitely worth checking out.",7,0,2,16 July 2018
Justice League," Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill are terrible actors in this
","When 2 of the main characters are awful, the movie isn't going to be very good. Ben Affleck is the worst Batman, his fake gruff voice is just terrible. And Henry Cavill is so wooden, nothing like Christopher Reeve. The only character I liked in this was Wonder Woman, at least she had a little personality. The story and villain was awful. Was Steppenwolf just something they made up or was he in the comics, I have no idea. All I know having him try to obtain 3 boxes, which all were pretty easy to get, then the final battle was just boring. And they just threw in all these supporting characters from other super hero films, I'm just tired of all these comic book movies.FINAL VERDICT: Like most marvel comic movies, not worth your time.",4,0,4,14 July 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," I just don't understand...
","how there can be so many positive reviews about TLOTR.  I hated this movie. It was so funny because I watched this with my mom and during the last hour we were laughing, cracking jokes in the theater, constantly saying when will this be over.  It was WAY to long. And everytime I thought it was going to get good, once again another boring scene would come along.  Maybe this would have been more enjoyable if all three movies had been released together. AT least there would be some closure at the end.  There were to many FX shots too. I just can't understand how this could have been nominated for any awards.  The only reason I saw it was it was big at the box office. I didn't really care to see it in the first place because I usually don't like movies set up for sequels (except the Matrix).

The Matrix Revolutions," dull ending
","I can't decide if the third film was better than the second. Both were not too good. The biggest complaint with this one was the solution to the war between man and machine. It was dumb and simple, and didn't make a whole lot of sense. It had so many CGI effects and no plot. What was the point of Jada Smith. It mainly showed her sitting down piloting a ship. And it didn't even make sense why they had to go the hard way to get to Zion. Plus, the ship kept hitting everything and still kept going. And Trinity was a waste in this film. Her character was so great in the first film. And why waste Monica Belluci. I don't think she even said anything in this movie. The Trainman was dumb. It was supposed to be an obstacle for Neo to overcome, and all he does is get on the subway when it comes by the second time. Real suspenseful, huh!And the final fight between Neo and Mr. Smith was silly. Why do they keep hitting each other when they both have superhuman strength. And when Neo turns into an agent but then isn't one anymore. That made no sense. So, some how in the real world the machines kept Mr. Smith from taking over Neo in the Matrix. I really have no idea.FINAL VERDICT: It's awful that they turned such a great movie as the Matrix into a very generic, boring trilogy. If you really want to see how the story ends, then go ahead and watch it. You really couldn't be more disappointed after the second movie. But, if you have only seen the first Matrix, then I recommend stop there and don't let the last 2 sequels ruin it for you.",Null,0,1,15 November 2004

It begins on Krypton and we see how Kal came to be and what his parents did to get him to Earth. And we learn about bad guy General Zod, whom was sentenced to being frozen but turned out to be good for him since he survived the planet explosion. They track Kal to Earth where he is Clark Kent and in this story not a reporter but a drifter, trying to hide his abilities but has a need to save people. He befriends Lois Lane and meets Zod, then they battle it out on earth.

Radio," hokey, but better than I thought it would be
","Radio is about a retarded guy who is taken in by a football coach. He soon helps with football practices, goes to games, and even attends school. After football, he gets to join the basketball team. Of course, they have a 'bad guy' who doesn't want Radio at school or the football games and he complains to the school board. That guy's son plays a couple of mean tricks on Radio, but Radio is too stupid to realize how he's being treated, so he continues to treat the guy like his best bud. Of course, this eventually makes the mean kid like Radio and not want to get rid of him.  And the other turning point is the football coach finally quits in order to spend more time with his own family who he has often ignored.  I guess Cuba took this role because he thought it may be another award nomination, but Ed Harris gives the better performance. He was very believable as a coach from the 70s.FINAL VERDICT:  It's nothing I care to see twice.  There are better movies about handicapped people out there.  So, I only recommend it if you don't mind really cheesy films with stereo-typical characters.",Null,1,2,26 July 2004
28 Weeks Later," When will directors learn....
","a shaky camera does not make a movie scarier, it just makes it harder to tell what is happening. There is nothing special about this movie, there's some gore, but because of the camera work, it is hard to tell much detail about it. It's basically a chase movie. The us army has quarantined a section of England and has begun introducing inhabitants. Two kids some how sneak past security and head off into London, which has not been secured. They go to their old house and encounter their mum, thought dead. First of all, the army would never bring someone back into the quarantined area that might be infected, but they did.

The Village," a big disappointment
","I'm glad I didn't pay to see this after watching it. I really liked Night's other 3 films, esp. Signs, which I thought was great. But this was dull, too easy to figure out, and not tense or scary. Also the funny lines were missing that were in Signs. This movie moves at too slow a pace. The film is about a village in a remote place where the elders tell everyone not to go beyond the borders because creatures live in the woods. It centers around 3 people: a blind girl Ivy, the guy she likes Lucius, and a mentally retarded man, Noah, who likes Ivy. Events happen that lead Ivy to want to venture to other towns in search of medicines. So even before she leaves, the 'big secret' is revealed. So half the movie, we already know the plot twist, which makes it much less tense and exciting. And the demise of Noah isn't thrilling either.FINAL VERDICT: I never thought I'd dis a Knight film, but I don't recommend this one. The plot and mystery just don't hold up to his other films.",4,0,2,28 July 2005

The cool part about this movie is you start to root for the 'bad' guy, as he becomes the 'somewhat' hero of this film.  Vin Diesel rocks as the ultra bad Riddick. But, we soon wonder is he really as bad as Johns(the bounty hunter) makes him out to be.  I liked the creatures. They were great considering this is a fairly low budget film.  (SPOILERS):  Riddicks' see in the dark eyes are cool, and I was glad when he got rid of Johns, as were the others.(END OF SPOILERS)  This is Vin Diesel's break out movie for bigger and better things. I'd also like to see a sequel about Riddick.  FINAL VERDICT:  A great movie to see late at night, to make it all the more creepier.",Null,0,0,28 May 2002
Split," suspend reality and you....
","will like or maybe even love this movie. Three girls are kidnapped by this guy, Kevin, whom has different personalities. Some of the personalities know that this is wrong and try to talk to his doctor, but the evil one, Dennis, takes control so the others can't talk to the doctor. Eventually we know about 1 more personality, the beast, whom can climb walls, has leather like skin, is more bulkier than Kevin. At first the doctor doesn't believe the Beast exists, but soon learns different when she goes to Kevin's home. She's knocked out as soon as she discovers the kidnapped girls.Then the beast shows up and only Casey is left, but he let's her live because he knows she has suffered abuse like he did.FINAL VERDICT: Just suspend belief and believe that a guy can grow bigger muscles and become animal like because it's a different personality. If you do, then you will be glad you checked it out.",7,1,3,2 November 2017
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," boring, little magic
","I love the Harry Potter books but have thought the movies have been less that stellar. And this movie was probably the worst one yet because it was so boring. Hardly anything happens except we see Harry, Ron, and Herimone wondering throughout forests, graveyards, and old houses. A couple of fake looking snakes make an appearance. About half the film is them looking for a locket, the other half finding out how to destroy it. They should have just made a 4 hour TV mini-series out of this.FINAL VERDICT: If you've watched all the Potter movies, then you have to watch these last ones just to see how bad it can get.",4,0,0,20 December 2011
The Hills Have Eyes," ending was better than the original
","This was a pretty good slasher flick. The story follows the original closely. Characters have the same names, one dog dies and the other saves the day, the dad gets burned, etc...you get the idea. But the ending was much better. In the original, the dog attacks the last mutant, the dad gets the baby and it just ends, no real resolution. In this one, there is the added deserted town and it does have a final resolution. Also, there is no snakes like in the original.It has some gruesome deaths and disturbing scenes. Watching your dad burn to death is very bad and that really wasn't the worst part. One of the final fight scenes between Doug and the big mutant was good. It's like the mutant had the chance to finish him with the ax but gets too cocky. That was great. It was also very gross when Doug wakes up in the box filled with body parts.FINAL VERDICT: If you like gross horror films, then this is for you. I liked it, it's worth watching.",6,0,4,12 January 2007
Cold Mountain," If the love story would have been more believable...
","this movie would have been so much better.  While an 'epic' film like Gladiator really makes you feel for Maximus and root for him because his troubles are written well, this movie feels cold because the 2 lead characters barely knew each other before being separated.  They should have fell in love and been engaged or something before Inman gets sent to war. It seemed boring in places, but since I have read the book, I think that comes more from the book.  I didn't think the book was that great either.  Renee Zellweger saves the day as Ruby. She was the best actor in the film and got all the great lines.  Also, the first battle scene is not for the sequemish. We get some close ups of swords going through bodies that is gross.  But, I like war movies, so I thought it was great.  Also, it seemed to me that Nicole Kidman lost her southern accent at times. I found that annoying; plus the accent she used was way over the top.  Everyone from the south doesn't sound like a mountain hillbilly.  Not to mention for someone who was supposed to be starving, Ada's hair and skin always seemed perfect.
Another question I had was why did that young blond bad guy not have to go to war?  Instead he got to play deputy even though he was in the age range to fight.FINAL VERDICT:  This certainly isn't one of the best movies I have seen, but it is better than a lot of films out there.  Teens probably won't like it, but I recommend it for the older crowd.",Null,0,1,30 December 2003
Little Miss Sunshine," a dysfunctional family road trip
","This is not a slap stick comedy, but it is entertaining and amusing. It was one of the better movies of the year. Olive has a chance to enter the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. It is a very long drive from her house to the pageant. Her dad, mom, brother, granddad, and uncle all make the trip in VW that they have to push in order to start it. The granddad like to cuss and is a heroin addict. The Uncle was just released from a psych ward after attempting suicide. The brother has taken a vow of silence until he gets into the air force. The dad is motivational speaker who is trying for a book deal. The mom just tries to keep the family together.Of course, this road trip has many obstacles to overcome. Grandpa dies and they steel his body out of the hospital. The dad finds out he didn't get the book deal. The uncle runs into the guy that made him attempt suicide. The brother finds out he is color blind, which may be the best scene of the film.And once at the pageant, it is quite apparent that Olive is not a beauty queen. And disaster strikes when it's her turn for the talent show.FINAL VERDICT: Good, not the best film out there. But entertaining with interesting characters.",7,0,2,23 July 2007
Knowing," creepy, suspenseful, and very good
","This movie was surprisingly good. Now days when you see Nic Cage starring in a movie, I usually think it's going to be a dud, but this was a good script. It's really creepy and that's what makes it good.Caleb's school is opening a time capsule and the letter he receives is a page filled with seemingly random numbers. His dad, John, takes a look at it one night and figures out the numbers actually mean something. They predict the day, location, and the number of people that die in some catastrophic event. He researches all the dates to events in history except for the final few because they haven't occurred yet. Then there is the really creepy whisper people that talk to his son. John goes to meet the daughter of the the woman that originally wrote the predictions and finds out her daughter is special too. So, they try to stop the last and final event from happening, and the ending really had me fooled. I was scared watching it; that's how creepy it was.FINAL VERDICT: highly recommend it",9,5,10,9 December 2010
Hugo," an orphan with a mission....
","a mission to make the man machine his dad left him work. That's what this movie is about. It was pretty good, but I didn't think it deserved all the awards. The scenery wasn't that great. But Ben Kingsly deserved some acting nominations. I'm surprised he didn't get any.Hugo is an orphan whom keeps the clocks working at a train station in Paris. He has to escape the Station Inspector every day and he must steal food to survive. One day the toy shop keeper obtains Hugo's notebook and sees something familiar in it. With the help of Georges goddaughter, Hugo solves the mystery of whom Georges used to be and the connection to his father.

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," So much was lacking from this movie...
","as compared to T2. I loved T2. The special effects were new and story was great. T3 has your average special effects, but the problem is the story is not very good nor interesting. I'm glad I didn't see it at the theater. Most of the chase scenes are rather boring since it's nothing new.  And the new TX doesn't do a lot of cool stuff. Plus, this movie was made like a pg-13 film. There were only a couple of scenes that made it an R. The terminator films are R movies because they have blood and violence. In T3, there is a lot of violence from machine guns, but the only real blood involves the TX sticking her arm through a cop while he's driving.There is a cameo from the doctor at the psych ward in T2. He just runs off when he sees Arnie. There was so much potential for a big laugh there, but we didn't get it.And the way Arnie dies here is so uneventful as compared in T2. In T2 it was moving, but we don't even see him die on screen here. The ending does set itself up for a sequel that has a lot of potential, but they don't need to make it if James Cameron won't do it.FINAL VERDICT: If you are someone just dying to know what happens next in the terminator series, than check it out. Otherwise, it isn't that great of a film just to pick up at the video store.",Null,1,3,14 June 2004
"I, Robot"," Better story than I thought
","I thought this would be an all visual film, but it actually had a plot that made sense. A suicide possible murder happens in the building of the world's leading robot maker. A detective that doesn't trust robots to follow the 3 rules gets assigned to the case. The rules have to do with not harming humans, which one robot has been programmed to be out of the ordinary. His name is Sonny, and he is the key to the mystery. Spooner teams up with a hot chick to solve the case but for once a movie where the 2 leads aren't romantically linked.The robots looked good. I was expecting them to look more like a cartoon, but they looked like they were 2-dimensional.The clues lead to only more questions and finally to the person who is behind the robot take over. I didn't guess who it was so I found it some what suspenseful.FINAL VERDICT: Good special effects and a story that is interesting but not that original. But I think it was good enough to recommend.",7,0,0,14 July 2005
The Alamo," long, boring portrayal of the battle at the Alamo
","This movie was much too long. It should have been 30 minutes shorter. And not much action happens in the first 90 minutes. There is supposed to be character development I guess, but it was boring. I thought Dennis Quaid and Billy Bob were bad in their roles. I didn't buy them as these famous Americans they played. Much of the first part of the movie just shows them hanging out in the Alamo watching the Mexicans or shooting a little. That didn't need to be shown 10 times.And it seemed like the director just deciding to add on the last 15 minutes because he thought it needed to be longer. The movie is about the Alamo. But, the very end has to show the Americans beating the Mexicans. In these war films, America has to always come out on top.FINAL VERDICT: This wasn't worth watching.",1,5,19,3 May 2005
Wanted," awful action flick that is...
","too silly for words. I don't like movies that on the inside try to appear to be serious but on the outside are completely ridiculous. And this film is one of the most ridiculous/silly movies I've ever seen. Please don't try to be real when characters are shooting bullets and some how making them curve in mid air. So silly. The action stunts such as when Fox is hanging out of the front widow shield of the red sports car firing a gun. So stupid. And why would part of the training to become a killer involve beating a trainee up repeatedly, even stabbing them in the hand. Or how about at the end when Fox fires a bullet and it magically travels in a circle.The one good part is Angelina Jolie is looking as good as she's ever looked in a movie. Her make up and hair are perfect for super sexy killer.FINAL VERDICT: Not even worthy of being called a popcorn flick. The plot was awful and I can't believe they are talking about a sequel. Don't waste your time with this.",3,1,4,2 August 2009
Salt," Fair action movie, but still very unbelievable
","I liked the action scenes in this movie, but quite a few of them were still just absurd. Angelina Jolie plays a CIA agent whom was secretly trained as a child to be a Russian spy. She is living in America waiting for the green light. First, why would Russia want to start a war with America in today's world. Simple, they wouldn't. This plot is more for the times during the Cold War decades ago. But overlook this, and then you have a petite Jolie, playing Salt, whom jumps off semis and lands on vans and hangs own and is able to over power about 4 guys in a police car and kick them out the car and use a stun gun to control the driver, and she is able to get up and walk out of a totaled car after going over a bridge. Not to mention her alone is about to get by security to get in the church during the funeral. It just starts to get silly and why at the end in the room under ground would all the glass be bulletproof yet the walls are not surrounded by steel. Instead Salt is able to blast her way through the sheet rock to get to the control panel. Don't buy that.FINAL VERDICT: Jolie is good but is given some silly things to do. It still was exciting and I recommend it.",6,1,2,10 May 2011
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," funny fictional biography film
","I never heard of this film before watching it on cable. It turned out to be surprisingly funny. This movie is about a fictional musician named Dewey Cox. It sort of follows recent films like the ones about Ray Charles and Johnny Cash. It starts with Dewey as a boy and he is responsible for a horrible accident with his talented brother. It's quite funny as the top half keeps talking. Flash forward to high school. Dewey is now played by John C Reily and he is supposed to be 14. Quite funny. He sings a song that sends people into a tizzy. Next thing you know his married, with a kid, and trying to make it in showbiz. Another really funny thing is whenever Dewey runs into the Tim Meadows character doing drugs. He also says you don't want none of this. Then acts offended if Dewey wants to say no. But as the story goes, Dewey gets hooked on drugs. He gets anther wife and has so many kids he can't keep track of them. He is at odds with his dad.And the songs they come up with are catchy, but silly. The film just en-chances the typical out of control life of a rock star.FINAL VERDICT: Better than expected. Not for kids.",7,11,22,20 October 2008
We're the Millers," another road trip comedy
","The idea behind this movie is nothing really new. It's a road trip, this time to Mexico. A small time drug dealer, David, owes his supplier. In order to pay the debt, he must deliver a shipment of drugs from Mexico to the US. He 'hires' a family to help him to seem less suspicious. They get the drugs then hi-jinx ensues. Of course, they are chased, there's some poll dancing, a huge spider, a lesson on kissing.All of it was amusing and it was one of Jennifer Aniston's better comedic roles. Kenny was the funniest character, with his naivety and shocked that he wasn't getting paid.FINAL VERDICT: It was OK, decent for a light weight comedy.",6,2,2,6 May 2014
Disturbia," Teen turns voyeur...
","which leads to discovering whom one of his neighbors really is. In the beginning of this film, it has one of the most horrific car accidents I've seen in a movie. It's very sad. The way it is shown on film is from a neat perspective.Next, it is a year later, and Kale the teen whom survived while his dad died, has become troubled. He is sentenced to house arrest. To pass the time he puts his video camera and binoculars to good use and becomes a voyeur. The new neighbors have a hot teen daughter whom he spends a lot of time spying on and soon becomes friends with. But, it's Mr. Turner who soon becomes the most interesting neighbor. Kale, along with Ashley and his friend, suspect Mr. Turner is a serial killer. There is a lot of cat and mouse with Turner. Does he suspect Kale is on to something or is he seeing only what he wants to see? I thought the movie was suspenseful and thrilling like a movie like this should be. It was entertaining. Like when Ronnie goes missing in Turner's house and the next we see of him he appears dead. That had me fooled. And when Kale is exploring Turner's house and we see how twisted and how many secrets he had. That was creepy.FINAL VERDICT: Teens will really like this since it's teens who are the heroes. Although I do find it hard to believe Turner would blow his cover like he did, you think he would have just vanished. I definitely recommend this.",7,0,0,3 March 2008
Silver Linings Playbook," who thinks this was good? Not me
","After finally watching this over hyped film, I don't get why people think it is really good. I thought it was barely watchable because it was so boring. I don't get all the award nomination nor how Jennifer Lawerence could win an Oscar for this role. There was nothing outstanding about her character, Tiffany, to warrant a stand out role. And the worst part was the lack of chemistry between Bradly Cooper and Jennifer Lawerence. First he looks 20 years older than her, and why would a depressed widow want to hook up with a bipolar manic who has melt downs. Simple, it wouldn't happen.The movie is about released mental patient, Pat, goes home and is obsessed with his estranged wife. He has mental break downs and meats Tiffany whom knows his wife. He agrees to be in a dance contest with her if she will give the wife a letter. And that's the story. Nothing much happens.FINAL VERDICT: A big waste of time and it certainly wasn't one of the best films of the year. Skip it.",5,3,5,22 January 2014
Van Helsing," no wonder it was such a box office flop
","There's not a lot I can say that is positive about this movie. The only thing I liked were some of the werewolf scenes because they didn't look totally like a video game unlike Mr. Jeckyl, who looked ridiculous. Hugh Jackman must have signed to do this movie solely for the paycheck since he's usually in good to descent films. Kate Beckinsale chose to do this even after the stupid Underworld. And as most people have already said, her accent was horrible. Dracula was way-over acted. It was one of the worst Dracula's that's been on film. It's like the director couldn't decide if he wanted his Dracula to be comical or taken seriously.Part of the plot involves Dracula needing Frankenstein to use as a power source to bring his flying 'children' to life. Those were some of the stupidest monsters I've seen. And his brides were terrible CGI when they were shown flying also.As for the action/fighting scenes: they were terrible. Most of them were beyond unrealistic. Many of the scenes involving Anna, showed her jumping around almost like Ang Lee's Hulk. And she does all this amazing kung fu and falls 10 stories but never gets hurt.FINAL VERDICT: Terrible action, abysmal story, mostly stupid special effects. Basically a waste of a large sum of money.",3,3,9,16 April 2005
Divergent," interesting concept, poorly executed
","One of the biggest problems this movie has is its star, Shailene Woodley, is not leading lady material. There is nothing about her or her acting that stands out and takes command of the movie. All the actors were more on the boring side, mainly due to the fact the movie is at such a slow pace. More needed to happen for an adventure sci-fi movie. Another thing was the movie never explained why the Erudite thought they should control everyone and why the other 4 factions wouldn't gang up on them and stop them. Also what is going on outside the city walls. I wonder if any of the sequels go there? FINAL VERDICT: It's an OK teen movie, better than the Twlight films, but nothing great.",6,0,0,21 December 2014
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," this is an action comedy rather than scary movie
","If you are looking for an action comedy then this is for you. The film is filled with jokes. The funniest part is that it is set in middle age times, yet everyone has guns, shotguns, and they talk like current times instead of middle age times.In this story, Hansel and Gretel are left in the woods and come across a witch. In this movie, all the witches look like something out of Evil Dead rather than an old witch with a big nose and hat. They burn the witch and that starts their legend. Jump ahead and Hansel and Gretel have come back to their hometown to solve the disappearance of 12 children. They learn of a plot by the witches to perform a spell of the blood moon that would make them immune to fire. So the rest of the film is battles with witches, the evil sheriff whom doesn't want anyone else to be the hero, and finding out about white witches.FINAL VERDICT: Entertaining action film with good special effects. It is silly but is meant to be, worth checking out.",6,0,2,29 December 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," adult themed mystery
","The main problem with the movie is that it was too long. The ending is dragged out after we learn whom the killer is. It just kept going and going. There was no need to go back to the guy that had sued Mikael and see how Mikael and Lisbeth got revenge on him.A rich old man, Henrik, hires disgraced journalist, Mikael, to do research on the disappearance of his niece some 40 years ago. A very weird girl, Lizbeth, helps him discover the truth. What I didn't get is why did they have Lizbeth be tortured by that trust fund guy like that. Other than to show that she hated guys that abused women, why have something that disturbing put in there. And it was interesting how she handled the guy, but it had nothing to do with the murder mystery. Also, I didn't like the affair they started. I think Mikael was a sicko for doing it.Also, the revealing of the killer wasn't that shocking. It looks like that family would have known something of the sick perversions going on. Also, even I guessed whom Harriett was.FINAL VERDICT: It was OK, but slow moving at times. Only for adults.",5,3,7,9 July 2012
Dreamgirls," pretty good songs with just OK plot
","This movie was fairly good. It certainly isn't the best musically to come along in the past several years. For starters, it sorely lacks a little comedy. And I didn't think any of the characters were that great; I didn't want to root for any of them. I thought Jennifer Hudson sang the 2 best songs in the film. I really liked changing. I thought it was weird how most of the time the songs were part of the music act, then they would start having the characters sing as they were talking to each other and arguing. It seemed out of place. Beyonce Knowles wasn't anything great. She sure doesn't capture the screen like a leading lady should. Even though Eddy Murphy was over the top, he probably did the best acting.FINAL VERDICT: Worth seeing, just not as good as Chicago or Mulin Rouge.",7,0,0,16 December 2007
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Andy Sitzer is the new Napolean Dynamite...
","I compare the 2 characters because both are nerdy and had weird social lives. This movie is about a guy, Andy, who is 40 and still collects toys, sits at home,and doesn't date. He gets outed by his friends at work as a virgin. So of course they want to help him get some. They take him out and tell him how to talk to women, but something always happens to mess up the evening. Then he meets the one, and he finally asks her out. And it's easy to guess the ending.While the plot isn't much, the script was great. A lot of funny moments and comments are made by Andy. It's more funny because you could picture a nerd like that in real life being the same way.And the film's funny without a lot of gross humor.FINAL VERDICT: It deserved the hype. And it's worth watching twice.",8,0,1,20 July 2006
The Men Who Stare at Goats," just another weird movie
","I'm not really sure what the point of this movie was. It seemed like another George Clooney satiric movie except this one wasn't that good. It's about this reporter, Bob, whom goes to the middle east to report after his wife leaves him. There he meets Lyn, whom is involved with a secret government project where they use their minds to control things. Lyn calls himself a jedi and says Bob must have some in him too since he sketched a picture of the jedi eye. The middle of the film is them two getting captured, escaping, and traveling across the desert. Then the ending had something to do with spiking the water with LSD and letting all the goats and prisoners escape.The film was not interesting enough to keep your attention and keep up with what's going on.FINAL VERDICT: There are much better Clooney movies than this. Skip it.",4,1,6,2 September 2010
She's the Man," fun teen film
","This movie was pretty good. A lot of it has to do with the star Amanda Bynes. She has a strong screen presence and comes off as very likable. She plays Viola, a girl who is determined to show up her ex-boyfriend and prove that a girl could beat a guy at soccer. The girls soccer team gets cut and she isn't allowed to try out for the boys team. So, she goes to the rival school where her twin brother goes. The brother is on a trip to London, so she disguise herself as a boy and takes his place. She makes the soccer team but falls for one of the guys on it, her roommate, Duke. So, of course, there is many scenes of mistaken identity and Viola does crazy stuff to keep her secret.The only part that made me say mmm... was how could no one notice that Viola as Sabastian was several inches shorter than the guys and when her brother shows up he is just as tall if not taller. And no one notices! So, you do have to buy that in order to believe the story. But I say no way.FINAL VERDICT: Good, I recommend it if you are looking for a comedy.",7,0,0,6 March 2007

But Spiderman, actually has a plot with characters you care about.(SPOILERS):  That fight scene at the end with Spidey and Gobby was so kick a**! I also loved the tender moments between Peter and MJ. Sure, Some of the graphics with spidey hopping around on the balloons looked fake, but get over it. That doesn't take away from the story. And this movie made me laugh. It isn't even a comedy and I laughed more in this film than a bunch of other films. The scenes when Peter is at school getting into the fight with Flash were hilarious as well as when he tries to shoot the web.(END of SPOILERS)    Can't wait for the sequel.

Jarhead," needed to be more entertaining
","I didn't think much of this film. The story was bland once they got to Iraq. The first part was OK, since it had some laughs with all the cussing and yelling done by the drill Sergent. Once they get to Iraq, they turn into frat boys. These elite snipers have fake orgies, have parties prancing around in almost nothing, shoot rifles in the air during a huge party-that seemed dangerous to me. Then they portray the soldiers as being angry because they never have a chance to shoot someone. One soldier goes psycho because he didn't get to fire a shot. The film also portrays some of the soldiers feeling that's it a waste of time to protect the oil fields.FINAL VERDICT: One of the worst war movies I've seen, and I like war movies. I don't recommend it.",3,1,2,21 October 2006
Shrek Forever After," doesn't really add anything to the story
","There was really no need to make this movie other than to make more money. It's not like it added anything to the Shrek story. Plus it wasn't as good and had a really short run time at well under 90 minutes. Nothing made me laugh in this, but I'm sure kids will still love it. This time, Shrek signs a deal with Rumpelstilskin to erase a day of his life so he can be a scary orge again. What he doesn't know is Rumpelstilskin has plans to take over Farawayland and be king. To do this, he must see that Shrek never saved Fiona from the dragon. So, Shrek is taken to an alternate world where he never met Fiona and must get her to fall in love again or disappear forever. Quite a few of the other characters make appearances, but Donkey is the only one given anything to do.Final Verdict: a story works good the first time, but by the third movie it's old. skip it.",6,1,2,13 June 2011
Collateral," much better than Cruise's last 2 films: The Last Samurai and Minority Report
","This was a pretty good film, but Michael Mann's Heat and The Insider are better. The one silly scene I can think of is the night club scene. It is so ridiculous that most everyone continues to dance and not even notice as Vincent breaks people's necks and starts shooting people.Two of the best scenes were the jazz night club when Vincent, Max, and owner are sitting and when Max is eating in the cab and gets a sign from above. Now that made me jump.I thought the script writer started getting lazy toward the end when it seemed like your average chase thriller once Max calls Annie to warn her.But, I was surprised at the ending because I guessed wrong at who dies.FINAL VERDICT: Worth watching, better than most so-called thrillers out there.",7,0,2,13 June 2005
The Machinist," Is Christian Bale the next Nicole Richie?
","That's what came to mind after looking at the emaciated Bale. He is so scary skinny and it's not special effects. I don't know how he lost all that weight and still function. He plays, Trevor, an insomniac. He says he hasn't slept in a year and his only friend is a prostitute he pays for. He starts finding post it notes on his fridge he didn't put there. And he sees a big bald guy at work that no one else does. Because of this he becomes distracted and causes an accident that results in a co-worker losing a limb. He visits a waitress at an airport diner on a regular basis. He's becoming more paranoid and thinks everyone is lying about the bald guy. He gets fired and turns on the prostitute. You know this isn't going to end pretty.FINAL VERDICT: Good psychological film but I did think that the bald guy wasn't real from the beginning. Bale gives a good acting performance and is so think it just gives the movie an added oomph. I recommend it.",7,1,2,3 June 2006
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," awesome special effects, decent plot
","I think movie wise, this was the best of the Harry Potter films. The story was OK, but of course the books are better because they have so much more detail.The special effects are incredible. At times, it looks realistic. Like when Harry is flying on the half bird/half horse creature. The animal looks like it has depth. Another example is the extremely fast bus Harry catches a ride on at the beginning. It's refreshing to see a film with good effects that don't look like they belong in a video game.The acting by the kids has gotten so much better than in the first film. Too bad some of the teachers aren't featured more like they are in the books.FINAL VERDICT: If you have watched the first two films, then I'm sure you'll be watching this one. But, if you have never read the books are seen the other movies, then you best not start off with the third film because you will be lost.",7,2,3,10 June 2005

No one else notices Remy though, so Linguini gets all the credit. Only problem is Linguini really can't cook. The owner, Skinner, discovers that Linguini is really Gusteau's long lost son. That means Linguini could still inherit the restaurant. Customers begin asking for Linguini's special dishes, which are created by Remy. They strike up a partnership. Remy controls Linguini's arms with his hair. I know, that sounds really weird. Any way, its up to them to impress the harshest food critic of all and to find out about Linguini's father. Plus, Remy finds his family again, but can he leave the restaurant business behind for them.FINAL VERDICT: Very entertaining story with great animation. It had more substance than a lot of animated films.",7,1,3,21 April 2008
Bad Teacher," giving teachers a bad name
","This movie wasn't very good. First, there is not one character you can route for. The lead character, played by Diaz, is a foul mouthed,rude, lazy, pot head teacher. A teacher like her would be fired after the first week, but since this is Hollywood, she gets to keep her job. Basically, the whole movie is her sleeping in class, drinking in class, while she schemes too get the rich substitute teacher to fall for her. She gets the idea to raise money to get a boob job to snag him. So she steals from the school car wash and cheats to get a bonus. Definitely a BAD teacher.FINAL VERDICT: a sad look at teachers, not really funny, don't watch it.",2,7,12,28 January 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," what a let down
","Sorry, but this movie was horrible compared to Toby Mcguire's first Spiderman. I loved that Spiderman movie; it was funny and had a great story. In this remake, it's not funny and everything in it has been seen before. And Andrew Garfield goes around with his hair sticking up and just wasn't good casting. The way Peter Parker finds out about his super powers was no where near as good. And this movie copy cats so much from the first, like having Ben die, how he designs the spidey suit, how he gets back at the bully at school. And all of it was done worse in this film than the first one.FINAL VERDICT: I'm so glad I waited till this was on cable so I didn't pay to watch it. I recommend watching the Toby Mcguire ones and staying away from this.",3,2,5,8 March 2013
Aliens," This is one time...
","when I can say the sequel was better than the original. I love this movie. It is better than Alien and much much better than Alien 3.  I think it is so scary. One thing that makes it good is that you want to see Ripley escape with the kid and kill as many aliens as possible.  And those aliens are mean ugly little buggers.  Also, the special effects are good for an older movie.
FINAL VERDICT:  A must see for any sci-fi/action fan.",Null,0,0,23 June 2002
Dallas Buyers Club," Mcconaughey steals the film
","Even though not a lot happens, this was still a really good movie. Mcconaughey definitely deserved the Oscar. However, I wasn't impressed by Jared Leto and don't know why he won all the awards. Just because he got skinny doesn't mean it's a great acting role.The movie is about Ron, a cowboy that drinks, does drugs, and has random sex. He finds out he is HIV positive and is given 30 days to live. He decides to take his health care into his own hands and does what he can to get a hold of drugs that may help him. He goes to Mexico and gets thousands of pills. He starts up a business called the Dallas Buyers Club in which he gives the drugs to members. Basically, he is a drug dealer, sort of helping people, but also trying to make as much money as possible. He teams up with Rayon, since he can get him more customers and needs the drugs too. And Jennifer Garner plays the doctor that thinks AZT is not a miracle drug and thinks Ron is right for trying something different.Ron lives longer than expected and sees the day the FDA changes its regulations by making drugs more available to dying patients.FINAL VERDICT: A really good drama. Check it out.",8,1,1,18 September 2014
The Fast and the Furious," Hot cars, Hot guys equals...
","a good MTV like film.  I really liked the car racing scenes, although there should have been more.  Both Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are really hot but the acting wasn't to great, but what can you expect when  you are dealing with such bad dialogue with my personal fav being 'Smoke 'em'.  I think the music helped out a lot since the plot was lame.
(SPOILERS):  In the last hijacking scene, how could there have not been any other cars on that highway?  They could have at least shown a couple of other cars get run off the road.  And why didn't Dom race Johnny Tram at race wars? The race wars was built up to be this big event, but then hardly anything happened. We only saw 2 short races there.
And I would have liked to seen a better ending. At least show Paul Walker get led off in handcuffs. I mean, those guys robbed truckers and could have killed people on the road, and the cop just lets them go at the end because we(the audience) are supposed to see the Johnny Tram gang as being the really bad guys.  Dom's gang was just as bad, and I can't believe a real cop would just let them get away like that.  And another problem I had was if someone wrecks a car going 160 mph, I don't think they could just get out and walk away with a little cut on the head. If they didn't get killed, they at least would have a bunch of broken bones or be knocked unconscious.(END OF SPOILERS)
FINAL VERDICT: The cars, music, and eye candy kept my attention all the way through.  It's worth seeing.",Null,0,1,2 August 2002
X-Men: Days of Future Past," plot was too confusing
","I don't like sci-fi films when the plot gets too confusing and that was the case here. It starts out in present time, and the mutants are under attack from these human built robots, but by using time travel are able to warn there present selves when its time to leave a current location. Already sounds confusing.Anyways, the mutants decide to take a last stand and want to prevent these robots from ever existing. So Logan is sent back in time to stop Raven from killing this guy Trask, whom is leading the research to build these robots. So Logan, must get Xavier, Magneto, and the Beast to believe him. And of course, once out, Magneto doesn't stay good for long. And they are trying to prevent all this from happening during the President's speech.FINAL VERDICT: Too much stuff that happens this is hard to follow, it is so hard for a movie to do time travel right because there are so many what ifs. And I thought it just got lose in the convoluted plot. Definitely not as good as the first X-men movies.",5,1,3,18 April 2015
Saw III," lots of gore but the plot isn't as good
","I am a Saw fan. I really liked the first one with the twist ending and the second one was pretty good. But Saw 3 takes a dip in quality of story and entertainment. Amaanda is now shown to be in cahoots with Jigsaw and probably the worst of the two. I just didn't like her character. She didn't really want to play the game like Jigsaw and give anyone a chance to win. She was a winy psycho.This time the story revolves around a Dr., Lynn, who is forced to keep Jigsaw alive long enough to finish a game. She has a bomb around her neck that will explode if Jigsaw dies. We get a very gruesome brain surgery during this time.The other part of the game involves Jeff, a man who lives for vengeance since his son was killed by a car. Jigsaw has captured the men Jeff blame for his son's death and gives Jeff a choice. Jeff can show forgiveness and save them or let them die in gruesome ways. In the end Jeff tries to save all of them, but is never successful. The guy in the rack was the most gruesome of the death traps. Bones being snapped like that is never good.Then the twist is the link between Jeff and Lynn.FINAL VERDICT: OK, but not as good as the first 2. It's worth watching if you like gore and blood.",6,0,0,11 February 2008
Ocean's Eleven," cool eye candy
","This movie is a lot of fun.  Sure the plot is nothing exceptional, but the cast has a lot of big names. Did I mention Brad Pitt is really hot in this. I felt Julia Roberts was wasted. She was good with what little screen time she had. She should have been involved with the plot more.  The movie also had some comedic relief that made a fun idea even better.  Sure, the idea of a group of thieves robbing a Las Vegas casino could never happen because security is so tight, but it is always cool to see the impossible pulled off.
FINAL VERDICT:  This movie won't make you think, but it is a lot of fun. BTW, did I mention Brad Pitt is hot in this.  A good choice if you want to be entertained on a Saturday night.",Null,0,0,16 December 2002
Pearl Harbor," Two good things about this movie...
","the battle scenes and music.  This had the potential to be good, but why oh why did they throw in the dumbest, sappest, cheesyiest love story ever in a movie that was supposed to be about the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  Over half the movie was dedicated to the silly love triangle that was ripped off from some daytime soap opera.  And Ben Affleck is terrible in this.  But, maybe he seemed so bad because of the horrible dialogue he had to say like 'not anxious to die, but anxious to matter.'  And Alec Baldwin had a bunch of cheesy lines too. And why was Cuba Gooding JR even in this. He didn't have much screen time and not much to do. So much could have been edited out to make this movie closer to 2 hours instead of 3. If they had done that, more people would have liked it.
FINAL VERDICT: About 40 minutes of bombing is decent to watch but the rest is trash. Faith Hill's song at the end is the best part.",4,1,3,20 July 2002
No Strings Attached," the most predictable type of movie
","This type of movie is so predictable and been done so many types. It's the typical friends decide to have sex but keep it platonic not romantic. But of course, they both end up having feelings and falling in love and deny it at first, but get together at the end. Kutcher and Portman give nothing new to their roles. As a matter of fact, I didn't really think they had much chemistry.FINAL VERDICT: I guess this was supposed to fall in the generic romantic comedy genre, even though it's not really funny. So, it's aimed at women on their couch eating bon bons. So unless you are one of those, you will probably want to avoid this.",4,6,8,20 February 2012
Tropic Thunder," pretty funny, i'm surprised by how many bad reviews
","Sure, this isn't the funniest movie Ben Stiller has been in, but I still thought it was pretty good. Robert Downey Jr and Tom Cruise steal the movie with 2 great characters. Downey plays an Oscar winning actor whom really gets into his roles. In this war movie, he's gone black both in skin color and the way he talks. It's funny. And Cruise plays the head of the movie studio and all he does is cuss and be an *sshole. It's very funny.The movie is about this group of actors whom are in Vietnam to film a movie. In order to make it more realistic, the director takes the actors into the jungle. They have cameras and explosives already set up. So, the actors believe it's part of the movie, however, there is a group of drug dealers that are really shooting at them and capture a few of them. Stiller, is Tug Speedman, sort of washed up action star whom is playing the lead. The way he talks in character is very funny. Jack Black is the dope head whom is suffering withdrawals in the jungle. Some unknown is Alpha Chino, a rapper whom raps a rather dirty song: I love the *****.The director steps on a mine and Tug thinks it is fake and picks up his head and does all this gross stuff. It was gross but I found myself laughing. Another funny scene was Kirk telling Tug don't go retard all the way, that's why you didn't win the Oscar.Matt Mcconhay plays Tug's agent, has some funny scenes. But Nick Nolte was better as the crazy war vet that wrote the book Tropic Thunder. But we learn Nolte's character isn't telling the whole truth, which was funny. 'You grew hands.'FINAL VERDICT: I thought it was good. Certainly not for kids and not for people whom take things too seriously. But if you like comedies, I recommend this one.",7,0,2,9 June 2009
Hardball," should have just been a TV movie
","This was very average and really nothing new. So, that leaves the question how did this get released in theaters. If anything, it makes for a TV Disney movie.  And Keanu needs to stick to the Matrix films because his acting was awful in this.  And it would have been nice to see Keanu helping those kids with family problems or school work. Instead it's basically baseball.  His character should have undergone more of transformation because he was really a jerk in the beginning.
FINAL VERDICT:  Only for those who are interested in coaching underprivalged youths.  Otherwise, you would only like it if you are a big, and I mean BIG, Keanu fan.",Null,0,2,19 January 2003
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Turned into a fantasy
","I was not expecting this movie to turn into a fantasy type movie, but that's what it did. I thought it was a comedy like Michael Cera's other movies since he yet again plays the same character. But at least he's good at it. I didn't like how the movie started off like it was supposed to be about real things that could happen, then it turns into a video game as Cera, aka Scott Pilgrim, has to defeat his new girlfriend's (Romona) 7 evil ex's in video game style. They even explode into coins after being defeated. It just made the whole thing silly. I really liked the movie before it started getting silly. Scott's high school girl, Knives, was a cool character and even turns ninja at the end. But it was better when she acted all stalker-esk.FINAL VERDICT: I didn't like this movie. I also don't play video games so that could have something to do with it. Also, I think this movie's target audience is teenage boys, so I don't recommend it unless you fall into that category.",2,5,10,10 May 2011
Enchanted," loved the music and story
","I really liked the story and the songs were good too. The movie starts out with a cartoon princess and her animal friends. She is set to marry Prince Edward whom she's known a day. But Edward's step mom, Queen Narrisa, sends Gizelle to real world New York City. Amy Adams was perfect for this character. She sings well and has this sweet, high pitched voice perfect for being a Princess. Gizelle falls into the lap of Robert, whom has a little girl and a girlfriend of 5 years. It's not long before Gizelle realizes there's more to finding a guy than one can do in a day and wants more than the dazzling smile from Prince Edward. Edward finds her, but she wants to go on a date at the Queen's Ball. Narrisa comes to New York to stop the 2 and she becomes the big ending. Does Gizelle want more than a fairy tale typical romance? Does Edward get a wife? Watch to find out.This movie was funny also. From Gizelle making her own clothes to Edward's fascination with the TV. Quite a few funny scenes.FINAL VERDICT: Adults and kids will like this a lot. I suggest check it out.",8,0,1,17 August 2008
Inside Out," awesome animated film
","This was a good film. I think it's more for adults than kids. The movie creates personalities in this girl's mind. They are joy, fear, disgust, anger, and sadness. And these 4 control her actions and feelings. She moves to San Fransico and is OK with it at first. Then joy and sadness get sucked out of the control tower, so without joy, she can no longer be happy. So the middle of the film is about those 2 trying to get back and meanwhile the girl is mad because anger takes control. After joy and sadness overcome many obstacles to get back, they stop the girl from running away.FINAL VERDICT: It's just a cute film. Check it out.",8,4,23,27 February 2016
Resident Evil," Should have been more blood
","This movie was pretty good. The best scene didn't even involve zombies. The best part was when the 3 people were trapped in that hall and the laser comes after them. The end result showed show cool special effects.  The zombies weren't too scary themselves. And I wasn't impressed with the zombie dogs. They could have put more blood and gore in this.  The plot is thin and Michelle Rodriguez has some bad lines. Milla is good as the gun-toting *ss kicking hot chick. 
FINAL VERDICT:  If you like hot chicks kicking *ss, this is the movie for you.  Milla not only uses guns, but also gets in on the killing with kicks, punches, breaking necks, and even using her thighs.",Null,0,1,24 July 2002
Quantum of Solace," a bad bond film
","I thought this movie was terrible. First of all, there is no plot. Something about revenge but if you didn't watch Casino Royal right before, then it makes no sense. It's been over a year since I've seen Casino Royal, so I didn't remember much that carries on into this film. So Bond is after revenge for his girl's death from Royal and something about going to Bolivia and chasing a guy that is trying to buy much of Bolivia's water supply in order to get rich. He teams up with this chick, Camille, whom is after a general that killed her father. But she's not like a typical Bond chick because Bond doesn't get romantic with her.The way the action scenes were filmed was terrible. The camera was so shaky and just quick flashes; you couldn't even tell what was happening. And I don't like how this Bond is just out to kill people. Pierce Bronson's Bond was never like that. It makes him cold blooded and you don't want to root for him.FINAL VERDICT: I could barely make it through this movie, it was so boring because there is no story to follow. I don't recommend it.",4,21,30,12 April 2010
The Butterfly Effect," the problem with movies like this...
","is no matter what, there are numerous plot holes. I get how in the beginning with Evan as kid, the blackouts he suffered occurred because in the future he was time warping and changing events to create an alternative future. OK, so I guess this makes perfect sense to everyone, right! I mean, with this idea, then every time he went back, he created a new blackout and wouldn't that change everything from that day on, but when he wakes up in present time, he has no memories of how his past changed. We see flashbacks of him reliving some parts of his life, but when Evan comes too, he doesn't recall any of it. And every time he goes back to change something, he corrects one thing, like Kayleigh from committing suicide, but it always leads to some other bad situation, like when he got his hands blown off.It was interesting when he ended up in the psych ward and no access to his journals. You wondered how he would get out of that one, plus we see how his dad ended up there and stayed there.FINAL VERDICT: It was OK, but too confusing. And it makes you ask to many questions that start with 'what if'. Plus, it's hard to take Kutcher as a serious actor; he's in the tabloids too much. So, I only recommend it if you like sci-fi films.",6,4,9,11 January 2005
Alien vs. Predator," can anyone say stupid
","Stupid is the word that comes to mind after watching this movie. A group of explorers find a pyramid under the polar cap in Antartica. The rich guy, Weyland, wants to be the first one there to claim it as his find site. So, he rounds up an expert in ice climbing, Alexa, and an expert in Myan pyramids along with others. You'd think they would get a clue something's wrong when they get there and a tunnel from the surface to the pyramid has magically appeared. But no, they go ahead down the tunnel. So, we lean that the Predators lured the humans there. They have an alien in hibernation who is woken up. It starts producing eggs. Some humans get trapped with the eggs, so the alien breeding has started. The predators have hunted aliens for centuries as a sport. So some of the humans get trapped in the pyramid as aliens and predators battle. So, who survives, well who cares since this was so dumb.This was pg-13, so there are no good bloody deaths. It's very mild, another problem with the film. It is a far cry from the original Predator and Alien movies.FINAL VERDICT: Bad, one of those movies so bad it may get a cult following and one day be popular, but not yet. If you liked Aliens or Predator, skip this because it ruins the greatness of its predecessors.",2,1,4,10 August 2005
No Country for Old Men," one of the worst pictures to win the best picture award
","I'm not sure what all the hype about this movie was for. It was very average at best. The only interesting thing about it was Javier Bardem, whom played psychotic killer,Anton Chigurh. Chigurh is so cold blooded, has no conscience about killing and lets his victims choose their fate by a coin flip. Chigurh is chasing Moss because he stole millions from a drug deal gone bad. Chigurh is able to find him first because there is a tracker with the money. But after Moss barely escapes, I didn't get how Chigurh kept finding him since there was no tracker. Also, a small town sheriff is hot on their trail but is always a step behind.The ending was a disappointment. The movie never explained how Moss was tracked to the hotel. Also was the money ever found. And how did Chigurh escape the motel room right before the sheriff went in. Too much info was left out.FINAL VERDICT: It was average. Nothing great. And I wouldn't recommend it unless you want to see a great character in Chigurh.",5,2,4,16 September 2008
District 9," aliens in refuge camps....
","could be another title for this movie. District 9 is the name of the camps that millions of aliens have been sent to in Johanasburg, South Africa. It seems aliens arrived about 20 years ago and the humans put them in camps and control them. The aliens are called prawns because that means they are the lowest of the low.The movie is shot like a documentary. Government worker Wikus has been sent to get aliens to sign eviction notices. He picks up an alien cylinder that sprays him with black fluid. It begins to transform him. So, he's captured and this company wants to do experiments on him. He escapes and meets up with an alien whom may be able to help him. So the latter part of the movie is just year average chase film with explosions and such.FINAL VERDICT: It was OK, the aliens were good special effects and the story made sense. It's also got some nice kill shots for gore fans.",6,0,6,7 June 2010
Mamma Mia!," I've liked recent musicals I've seen but this one is just OK....
","it was no where near as good as Chicago or Moulin Rouge. The story just isn't that interesting. Sophie is getting married and invites the 3 men that may be her father. Her plan is to get them all at her mother's Greek villa and figure out which one is her dad. But when she sees them, it is not as easy as she thought it would be.The songs are weak, which is what makes it not so great. Sure Dancing Queen is a good song, but that's about the only one I really liked. And if I had a wish, it would be for Pierce Bronson to never sing in public again. He can act but if his singing was that bad, he should never have been cast in this part.FINAL VERDICT: Disappointing compared to other recent musicals.",5,0,1,3 August 2009
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," fast paced adventure
","I thought this sequel was pretty good. It had a fast paced and cool special effects and it moved the story along. The dragon was by far the best special effects. It actually looked sort of 'real.' The dwarfs along with Bilbo are on a journey to get to the mountain where the dragon and his treasure lies. They travel through a forest filled with giant spiders. They are captured by Elves and escape traveling down a river in barrels while being chased by Orcs. They make it to Laketown and then find the secret door into the mountain. Then Bilbo is sent to find the Arkenstone and dodges the dragon before all the dwarfs get involved. Then it ends, set up for the third installment.FINAL VERDICT: It was good. But know there is no conclusion. So I think it would be best to watch this once the third part comes out so you have an ending.",7,0,2,3 September 2014
Batman Begins," another summer disappointment
","I finally saw BB and was expecting great things from the reviews it received last summer. While not a bad film, it didn't have that dynamite punch you expect from a film touted as a summer blockbuster. I found the very beginning confusing and it took me 40 minutes in till I started finding it entertaining and not boring. The beginning is from the title, it shows how Bruce Wayne trained to become a deadly fighter with a secret organization. He goes back to Gothem after being gone years to rid the city of crime. Rachel, the girl he had a crush on, is an assistant DA and one of the few that has not been bought by the mob. The movie shows how Bruce developed the bat suit, mobile,and weapons. And of course he must battle the surprise (though he was gone/dead) villains at the end who want to destroy Gotham with a chemical that makes people crazy.FINAL VERDICT: OK, but not that great story you need to be a big hit. Spiderman was much better with how they showed the hero obtaining super hero moves.",6,2,4,23 May 2006
The Fault in Our Stars," it was too predictable
","I had never read the book nor knew much about the movie before watching, but I just knew whom was going to die about 15 minutes in, and that is the fault with this film.Hazel is a girl fighting cancer and goes to a support group. There she meets Gus, a very upbeat boy just 1 year older than her whom tells the group he's been cancer free over a year. Gus starts up conversation with Hazel and the next thing you knew they are calling each other and spending time together. A lot of their discussions center around Hazel's favorite book and what happened to the characters in the end. Hazel begins to let her guard down and realize she should enjoy her life till it's over.Gus uses his 'special' wish to take Hazel to Amsterdam to meet the author of her favorite book, but everything ends in disappointment. And at this time you already have guessed what is coming.FINAL VERDICT: It was an OK drama, but movies that try to feed on tragedy so people think they are good are not my favorite. But if you like to cry, definitely check out this movie.",6,0,1,7 March 2015
Twilight," OK, but the vamps should have done more cool stuff
","I have never read the books, so I can't compare the movie to them, but I'm sure the books are better for them to be so popular. The movie just wasn't worth the hype. It was OK, and it had a plot a lot better than most new films, but it just lacked that oomph.First, it's hard to buy the love story between Edward and Bella when all they do is stare at each other a few times at school and suddenly they are madly in love. Surely more happened in the book. And I thought there was going to be some sort of mystery with the deaths of a couple of people: like whether it was werewolves or rogue vampires. But that was hardly a side plot in the film. And I thought the whole vampire baseball game was a hokey thing for them to do . So much more should have been done with the vamps special abilities, then hitting balls a long ways and climbing trees really fast.Then the climax was Bella on the run from James. She goes back to Phoenix with the other 2 vamps, now how did they get out in the sun? Then she gets tricked by James, and James and Edward have a short fight. I did like the scene in which Edward has to save Bella by sucking out the venom.FINAL VERDICT: If you are not a fan of the books, then this movie probably won't be too appealing.",6,1,3,24 January 2010
Blue Crush," Beautiful scenery...
","with the landscape and actors, but under it all, this is basically a teen fluff film.  It has some good music and I liked the camera work for the surfing scenes. It's like we get to see what it is like when a surfer gets crushed by the wave.  And there are some funny moments with the fat NFL players.  What I didn't like is the main character is turned into a slut. Anne Marie sleeps with the quarterback like the second day she knows him. And like he would have any respect for her, much less go down and cheer her on at the surfing competition.  Then, she gets mad when she hears some of the other girls talking about the quarterback and  the Denny's waitress. I mean, she knows he was only going to be in Hawaii for a week anyways.FINAL VERDICT:  Some nice eye candy and neat camera angles during the surfing scenes.  But, the plot isn't anything great.  It would worth watching if you are looking for some mindless fun with hot actors.",Null,0,0,28 July 2003
To Rome With Love," the stories just weren't that good
","I didn't think this movie was that good. The silliest of the stories was the regular guy, Leopoldo, all of a sudden becomes a celebrity. And no reason is given as to why! News reporters and camera men just start following him around and report what he eats and such, and he starts having affairs with beautiful models, even though he's married. It made no sense. The the story with Woody Allen was OK, he plays the dad who's come to Rome to meet his daughter's boyfriend. He hears her dad sing in the shower and thinks he's great. Only problem is the dad only sounds good in the shower, so some how we see him on stage in operas, singing while in a a make-shift shower. So silly. The only good story was the guy whom has a prostitute show up and she's seen by his family, so he pretends she is the girlfriend. They go to this high society party, and a lot of her clients are there. Then the last one involves college students. The girl has her actress friend coming to stay awhile and the boyfriend falls for her. All the while Alec Baldwin keeps showing up and talking to them, but it's not like he's really there. Just weird.FINAL VERDICT: Skip it.",3,1,6,29 June 2013
Bridesmaids," what a disappointment
","I was expecting to laugh a lot and didn't laugh once. This movie was not that funny, I don't get why it got so much press as being the funniest movie of the year. A bunch of F words, don't make a movie funny. Melissa Mccarthy had the best role, but the jokes just didn't make me laugh. Kristen Wiig's Annie character was just mean and ugly to her friends. Plus, the way she treats the guy who likes her like crap, but he still wants her at the end. I don't buy it. Different scenes seemed like SNL sketches, like Annie doped up on the plane or Annie breaking all kinds of traffic laws trying to get her guy's attention.FINAL VERDICT: Over-hyped, I didn't think it's worth seeing.",5,3,4,2 April 2012
Meet the Fockers," very disappointed
","I wanted to see this in the theater because Meet the Parents was so good. I laughed so many times during that movie, but the sequel was terrible. I hardly cracked a smile. All it is is sexual humor and it gets boring. I felt bad for the parents who brought their 10 year old kids to this expecting to see a lot of cat humor or mistaken identity. Instead it was close to an R rating because of the sex talk and raunchy words.And Greg's parents, the Fockers, were not funny. Hoffman and Streisand were bad. The baby with the head butt provided a little smile. And DeNiros's character had some funny moments too.It seemed like I kept waiting for something to make me laugh, and it never did. I nearly fell asleep during the last half hour, and I'm sure I missed some dialogue. But I really don't care.FINAL VERDICT: This is one film they never should have done a sequel to if all it was going to be was sex humor. I don't recommend it and definitely not for kids.",3,3,8,30 December 2004
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," entertaining adventure but was a little too long
","This movie was pretty good but could have been shorter. And I wouldn't recommend seeing any the next film in theaters because you know it will be like this one with no ending. You should wait till the third one comes out so you can watch it all back to back. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this because I don't like it when movies end like this, set up for the next one with no ending.Any ways, the special effects were good with trolls and goblins, but the rock giants served little purpose. Also, the beginning could have been sped up when they were in Bilbo's house waiting to start the adventure. I wonder why Gandalf couldn't conger a spell when they were stuck in the burning tree, how come he never uses more magic. My favorite part was Bilbo and Gollum during the riddle challenge.FINAL VERDICT: Worth watching, but I would wait till all 3 films are out so you don't get stuck with no ending.",7,0,3,19 November 2013
Non-Stop," social media on a plane
","This movie really wasn't that good. It's not much of an action movie and stars Liam Neeson, an actor turned action star once he reached 60. Social media, aka texting, is basically the star of the show. Neeson plays troubled air marshall, Bill Marks, whom is on a plane to London. On the plane, he starts receiving text messages from someone threatening to kill passengers if he doesn't get a lot of money transferred to a bank account. Marks uses cameras to come up with suspects whom may be using a phone. Sure enough, a few die, but at whose hands. Then a bomb comes into play.Can Marks find the hijackers, whom by the way, has become the main suspect with authorities on the ground, save everyone left on the plane and keep the bomb from destroying the plane? FINAL VERDICT: It's OK, but having the text messages appear on the screen just made it seem so cheap, like a TV movie. Not Neeson's best action movie.",5,0,1,1 November 2014
The Pianist," Good movie...
","but I don't think Brody deserved the Oscar. I didn't think his character was outstanding enough to win. Any movie about the Holocost always is sympathetic so people think it is so good. While this was good, Schindler's List was so much better.  Brody just doesn't do enough to have received any awards.  The movie shows a lot of horrific tragedies  suffered by the Jews. We see many people killed for no reason.  The first part of the movie is about the segregation of the Jews and the round up to be sent off.  Szpilman is saved by a friend and ends up surviving rule under the Nazis. They are shown going for a march and at any moment, a German guard may pick out several Jews and shoot them.  Szpilman escapes and relies on friends on the outside to hide him.  They eventually leave the city and he is own his own to survive.  The best part is when he gets the chance to play on the piano for the German.  He finally got a chance to do what he loved when before he could only pretend to play the piano because of the noise it would make.FINAL VERDICT:  This is the type of movie everyone should see to appreciate what they have today and learn a little history of what people had to do to survive during WWII.",Null,0,1,30 December 2003
The Transporter," another unbelievable action film
","The lead guy in this film reminded me of Bruce Willis from the Die Hard movies. He does all these bad *ss stunts with a little humor thrown in. Like when he's sliding around in the oil kicking butt. He should be killed so many times that it just starts to get boring after a while. And all the people in it just show up on que. Like the bad Asia guy when Frank gets the big truck to come to a stop.  And he just happens to come across a crop plane and knows exactly where the bad guys are on the highway.  But, I will say the lead guy, whom I never heard of before, was pretty hot and I'm glad he did a lot of scenes without a shirt.FINAL VERDICT:  If you really like action films, then you may want to check this one out.",Null,1,3,4 November 2003
Seabiscuit," Heart warming and moving...
","however; I can't say it was great. Mainly because of the subject matter: horse racing.  I know nothing about it or Seabiscuit's story before watching this.  And considering how no one cares about watching horse racing today; it is hard to imagine millions of people following the races of a horse back in the day. The story follows the concept of the little engine that could. We have a horse, jocky, and owner who all rise above what people think they are capable of doing.  The best part was the race against War Admiral, who was so much bigger than little Seabiscuit. Of course, the way the movie sets it up, it was fate that Seabiscuit wins.  Then, the horse and jocky both get injuried and each one over comes them to win another race. The movie ends there; but it never tells if that was Seabiscuit's and Red's last race. They could have flashed a paragraph about what they did next. If it was Seabiscuit's last race, then why not say so.FINAL VERDICT: Good; the kind of touching film I like.  The subject matter is just hard to identify with since hardly anyone even follows horse racing now days.",Null,0,0,31 March 2004
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," a decent action flick with a plot.....
","that actually made sense and wasn't too ridiculous. I was pleasantly surprised with this sequel. I thought it was much better than the last MI. There were still some outrageous silly stunts, but not as many, and I could get past them to enjoy the film. This time agent Ethan Hunt is after a criminal that blew up the Kremlin and stole nuclear launch codes. Him and his team track him down without the President's approval, hence the title, ghost protocol. The plot was easy to follow and not filled with holes. There was still some BS stunts, like Hunt flinging himself on a tall building, releasing his rope, and landing where the missing window was and being pulled to safety. There was also the trickery in the hallway in the Kremlin. I can't believe that would really be possible.FINAL VERDICT: Worth checking out for an action flick.",7,1,3,8 October 2012
Revolutionary Road," not much revolutionary about this
","What a disappointing movie. Not much happens. It's basically about a couple, Frank and April, and how they argue all the time. April is basically a basket case; crying a lot and telling Frank she doesn't love him any more. Frank has affairs; she doesn't care. She has them herself.The couple have 2 kids; however, they are hardly in the movie. That didn't make sense. I know at one point the kids where supposed to be gone somewhere, but the movie never said. And at other times, like when the couple would be eating dinner, the kids were missing. That was just weird.At the end of the movie, April does something destructive with severe consequences. She truly need to see a psychiatrist.FINAL VERDICT: Boring, it's mainly a movie about arguing. I don't recommend it.",3,2,3,27 December 2009
28 Days Later...," What a disappointment
","I was expecting much better from reading a lot of good reviews.  But, it wasn't very gorey and it wasn't very scary. I have seen a lot of movies that were more tense and made me jump in my seat. Sure, it was cool that these zombee's moved very fast, but they didn't do a  whole lot.  But, the plot is what ruins this movie: too many holes. First, most of the world is dead and we have these 2 strangers who want to hook up by the end of the film.  Then we have some army guys who are only looking for women  to rape.  Just ridiculous.  And I never understood if the dead only come out at night or what. Why didn't they attack that building the army guys were in constantly instead of only at night.  And why didn't the army guys go empty a grocery store instead of eating rotten eggs.  And why did they decide to kill Jim by walking him out in the woods. Why not just throw him outside the fense around that building.FINAL VERDICT: There are much better horror movies out there.",Null,1,2,17 May 2004
It Follows," slow horror film....
","based on a demon STD? That is what comes to mind trying to explain this movie. Jay finally sleeps with her boyfriend only to find out that he passed something on to her. Some kind of supernatural being will now be following her and if it gets her, she will die. He tells her it can be an any form but moves slow, only walks. So, she can get in a car and drive somewhere and not have to worry for several hours. He tells her to pass it on and not to die because it will come after him.So she has her sister and friends helping her escape, but they can't see the being. But they do see it moving objects. So, of course, you get your jump moments as something just shows up. She passes it on but it doesn't work out. Then does it again, but I didn't like how the movie left the ending open. You assume the boy passed it on, but don't know for sure.FINAL VERDICT: moves too slow and plot is really out there. Not exactly what horror fans are looking for. So, I only recommend it if you don't want much action.",5,1,5,24 April 2016
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," entertaining sci-fi ape movie
","I liked this movie and thought it was a decent story. I also liked the special effects and am not sure what some are complaining about with those. For the most part, the chimps looked realistic and had facial expressions.Franco plays Will, a scientist working on a cure for Alheimzer's, which his dad has. He has a drug he wants to try on humans, but a chimp goes crazy and his drug is discarded by the company. But, Will takes home a baby chimp whose mother had the drug in her system. The chimp, Ceaser, proves to be exceptionally smart, but attacks someone so is sent away. Meanwhile, Will uses the drug on his dad and sees great results in the beginning. Ceaser sees a way to get all the chimps to follow him and releases the drug. Soon , he has a gang of smart chimps and they escape and cause a mess. And we see how the chimps will rise because the new drug Will was working on, is deadly on humans.FINAL VERDICT: It was good and a fun popcorn flick.",7,1,3,5 June 2012
City of God," great movie made with a low budget
","Why can't Hollywood get it right with all these big budget movies, when a small film like this does it the right way. First, the script was great as well as the cinematography. It's no wonder those things as well as the director got nominated for so many awards. It's a wonder it didn't win for best foreign film. The movie was based on real events about a boy named Rocket who lives in the slums of Rio. Many kids there turn to a life a crime and he witnesses all of it. Two warring gangs take over the streets. He gets the opportunity to take pictures of it and gets them in the newspaper. At the end it tells us he won awards for the pictures he took, including a death picture of the boss of the City of God.Just the way the story was told and how we are introduced to the characters is what really makes this film great. It could have easily been confusing, but all the flashbacks as to how some of the kids became hoodlums was well written and made sense. And it was something to learn how Rocket's older brother, Goose, was killed, but still Rocket managed to stay out of the gangs.FINAL VERDICT: The subtitles are easy to follow and don't hinder the enjoyment of this movie. I highly recommend it. It reminded me a lot of Blackhawk Down.",Null,1,4,21 October 2004
Cars," great animation but...
","the story falls flat. This is pixars worst film. While the animation is top notch. The story wasn't very entertaining and it is not as funny as the other films. Seven year old will like it, but it's not that good for adults. The plot is very simple. A hot shot racing car gets side tracked in a small town. He must pave the road in order to earn his freedom and be on his way. The lesson of the story is winning is not everything, being a good person is. A lesson that has been told many times.FINAl VERDICT: I didn't find it very entertaining. Certainly no where near as good as Finding Nemo. I don't recommend it for adults.",3,3,8,7 May 2007
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," jumping around like a toad doesn't make a good film
","I don't get why so many people seem to like this film.  It was terrible. It sucked.  There was no `magic' in this.  Just a bunch of silly fighting scenes.  The plot was ridiculous.  And there was nothing special about this so called love story.  Many movies have done it better than this.  I don't think seeing people fight in a tree and jump around like a frog that weighs as much as a feather as very entertaining.FINAL VERDICT:  Please, please, I beg you don't give this boring, uninteresting film any more money.  Avoid this like the plague.BTW:  The score in Gladiator was so much better than this. I can't believe this film won the oscar for musical score.",Null,0,1,28 May 2002
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," too long and needed more of a plot
","Not to much happens in this movie. It's about a washed up tv western star, Rick Dalton, and his sidekick, Cliff Booth, a stuntman. Cliff doesn't get much work any more, so his friend, Rick whom lost his driver's license, hire up to drive him around town. Rick gets a part to play a villain in a western movie. Meanwhile, Cliff gets into a beef with Bruce Lee, why? Rick lives next door to Roman Polanski and his wife Sharon Tate. Cliff gives one of the Manson girl's a lift to the ranch and has a look around. Eventually Rick goes to Italy to be in shows over there. When he, his new wife, and Cliff return home in 6 months, it happens to be the night the Manson groupies plan on killing he residents of the Polanski house. But instead they break into Rick's house have a run in with Cliff and his dog. And Rick breaks out his flame thrower. A comic twist on what really happened.FINAL VERDICT: To long at over 2 1/2 hours, and like other Taratino movies, too many scenes that are just talk, Like Rick talking to the kid on the movie set. The dialogue is just too long. As well as the dialogue at the ranch. If you see it, split it up into 2 days.",5,2,2,3 April 2020
Gone Girl," not really suspenseful
","I didn't think this was much of a suspenseful movie sense we already know the twist less than half-way through. The movie starts with introducing the couple, Nick and Amy, whom seem to be happily married. She's from a rich family while he's had to struggle and was out of work for awhile. They move back to his hometown to take care of his sick mom and stay there.One day Nick comes home, Amy is gone and there are some items smashed, so he calls the cops. They find blood traces and circumstantial evidence and are thinking she as taken, maybe killed. Soon, they turn suspicion toward Nick, mainly because of what was in Amy's diary.So Nick hires a hot shot attorney and goes on the defensive to portray himself as the lousy but loving husband after his affair comes out. So the movie portrays this as a big national news story because Amy was a successful writer.Less than an hour in, we find out what happened to Amy and how calculatingly evil she can be. She had planned on killing herself and having nick go to jail for murder, but decided she wanted to live. After being robbed, she takes up with her rich ex that is obsessed with her. She watches Nick shed tears for her and say how much he loves her on TV and changes her mind about him. She decided to kill the ex, make it look like he kidnapped and raped her, and goes home one day. But Nick and the cops are suspicious of her tale. Soon, Nick thinks she's a deceptive killer.But the ending is awful because of what Nick decides to do even though he believes she's a liar and crazy. I mean, fight for custody.FINAL VERDICT: It was OK but the twist was too early and the ending not good, I'd say skip it.",5,2,6,29 June 2015

Get Out," don't understand the hype
","This movie was OK, but I don't get why lots of people think it's one of the best horror films from the past few years. Plus I agree with those who say it has racism in it. It's like the film is saying white people are bad and just want to take advantage of other races.Anyways the film revolves around Chris, whom is invited by his girlfriend, Rose, to her parents house for the weekend and a party. At the house, Chris meets a couple of other black people whom seem to be off. At the party he takes a picture of one of them, and he flips out and tells Chris to 'Get Out'.Chris finds out the guy was someone from the neighborhood from his buddy Rod and that guy is missing. Chris realizes he needs to leave after finding a box of pictures of Rose with other black guys after she told him he was the first black guy she's dated.So the final is Chris escaping. That part was good.FINAL VERDICT: It was OK but not the best horror film. I think people just praised it because it actually had a little uniqueness about it and not the same old thing.",6,5,8,6 November 2017
The Theory of Everything," a beautiful mind: take2
","This movie reminded me a lot of A Beautiful Mind: where a genius must overcome a medical condition in order to be recognized as a true pioneer. In this movie, its a physical illness rather than mental one.The movie is about famed physicist, Stephen Hawking and focuses on his family life and how his physical state deteriorated to the point he's in a wheelchair and needs a machine to voice his thoughts.Eddie Redmayne was very good, just like Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind and he deserved all the acting awards. It's a good movie and the story was good enough to keep you entertained.FINAL VERDICT: If you want to see a drama, check it out.",7,0,2,18 August 2015

She leaves her just met fianc√© in charge and receives help with an ice seller, Kristoff, to track her sister down.

Worth checking out.",7,2,6,17 July 2014
2012," the story was better than I expected
","I didn't see this at theaters because I thought this was just another special effects movie with a really poor story. After finally seeing it on cable, it was actually pretty good. The special effects are really good like everyone says; and I liked the story also. But I do think John Cusack was miscast as the action hero because when was the last time he played one. And also Amanda Peet is not a big enough star for the leading female role.Just get over the fact that the hero, Jackson Curtis, accomplishes some impossible feats and just enjoy it. Sure can one really believe Jackson driving a limo and old RV over cracks in the earth and jumping huge holes. Or flying a plane though a huge volcano ash cloud or missing all those firey rocks spit out of the volcano. At least the Russian guy Yuri got what he deserved but why Tamara? FINAL VERDICT: Check this out.",7,1,2,30 July 2010
The Number 23," tries to hard to be clever
","I think the writer of this movie thought the story was clever, but it is too clever for its own good. The story just gets crazy and out there and hence becomes uninteresting. Jim Carey plays William Sparrow, a man who beings to read the novel The Number 23. He begins to find similarities between himself and the main character of the book, Fingerling. I never got how their two lives were similar. The movie explained this poorly. Sparrow begins to come up with all these crazy figures of how to get the number 23 or 32 or any variation. He says this plus this plus this equals 23, How weird? I just didn't get it. He has dreams of killing his wife and jumps out a window, but really doesn't. I'm not sure.FINAL VERDICT: I didn't like the story. I didn't think it made sense.",2,1,3,28 January 2008
Ghost Rider," entertaining action
","I have to admit, I thought a fiery skeleton on a blazing motorcycle was a pretty good idea. I liked the whole Johnny Blaze/ Ghost Rider character. I thought the special effects for the Ghost Rider and his motorcycle were well done. I did think Nick Cage looked weird with that dark hair piece he was wearing. He felt sort of miscast in the role.And for some reason they had Eva Mendez wearing shirts that were too small and only buttoned half way up. I mean, it looked like she was fixing to explode out of her shirts. But, I guess that was to appeal to the teenage boy audience.I liked Sam Elliots's role too. His deep voice just sounds so perfect for the movies.Blackheart looked like a wimpy goth. And the bad guys are defeated very easily by the Ghost Rider. But the Ghost Rider's pentance stare was awesome.One glaring plot hole: How did the police connect a bunch of frozen bodies to a motorcycle stunt driver and arrest him for their murders?FINAL VERDICT: Much better than expected. I thought visually, the movie was great. The script could have been better, but it was interesting enough.",7,2,3,24 December 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," If this is the best sequel that the writers can come up with,,,
","then please don't make another one. The third sequel pales in comparison to the first two films. The first X-men was fantastic. The second was pretty good, but not as good, and the third is a real let down. Gone are the cool action scenes and story lines involving Wolverine and Rogue. And for a movie that was supposed to center around the Phoenix/Jean Grey, she did not have much involvement through out the film. At the big fight at the end of the film, she just stands there most of the time. It was cool to see some new mutants, but lack of character and plot development did not do a lot for the film. Mystique had a good role while it lasted. Magneto did some cool things with smashing cars and moving a bridge. But I still don't get why the X-men wanted to stop Magneto from destroying the cure. It seems they would not want the government to force cures on mutants. Plus, what happened to the boy who could cure at the end. We see Kittie leading him out of the prison and that's it.I'm very glad I didn't see this in the theater now. The plot was totally lacking and didn't make good sense. The movie was just no where near as entertaining and fun to watch.FINAL VERDICT: If you want to see the continuation of the X-men series, you may want to check this out. But ,I kind of wish I had not seen it now that I know it is no where near as good as the first films.",5,1,3,7 May 2007
Hellboy," kind of lame and...
","the evil monster made no sense. It had something to do with Nazis and laying eggs and something about how the monster could reincarnate itself. I'm not sure how it all fit together; it wasn't explained well. Hellboy himself was kind of neat. The make up and costume were well done, but the one liners fell very flat. Hellboy's girl had a unique talent; too bad it wasn't show cased much. The fish guy was neat, but if they were going to throw other freak crime fighters in, then they should have had a handful of them. But, what I really didn't care for was the monster and the evil guy because they made no sense. How did the monster come to be? Was it brought to earth by the bad guy? Was the bad guy some type of demon or devil worshipper? And what was with him controlling the ugly faced dead Nazi guy, who was a master with the sword? I never understood how he did it. And who was the blond working with the evil guy? Also, the movie set up how much Hellboy depended on his father, but when the father kicks the bucket, Hellboy isn't too upset. He gets over it awful quick.And if they were going to have monsters in this, then there should have been several types of monsters to keep it more interesting.FINAL VERDICT: I know this is based on a comic book, but I didn't think it was anything like Spiderman or X-men. I really liked those movies, but didn't think much of Hellboy. So, I only recommend it if you think you have to see every special effects movie out there.",6,0,1,2 February 2005
P.S. I Love You," only in Hollywood....
","could something like this be possible. The whole story just didn't sound very plausible to me. It was too sappy, too dramatic. In the movie Holly's husband Gerry, dies from a brain tumor. They had been married ten years, and were still in love. She doesn't know how she will get through this. Then after several weeks, a birthday cake and letter arrive from her deceased husband. He said he planned all of this out and will send her letters throughout the months to help her get over his death. Such as want her to go sing karaoke, take a trip to Ireland and visits his parents, and fall in love again. Holly finds out in the end it was her mother whom was helping Gerry do all this.One thing I didn't like is Gerry would just show up and it wasn't flashbacks. Also, that was just creepy having Holly sleep with Gerry's best bud in Ireland.FINAL VERDICT: Those that love the date/romance movies will probably like this more. I thought it was decent, but not great and I just didn't buy this as something that could really happen.",5,1,2,8 December 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Pretty good, but I expect the 3rd film to be the best
","I think Fellowship was better than TTT. And having read the books, I feel the third book will make the best transition to film, so I can't wait to see ROTK. It should be the best movie of all 3. I would have liked this movie to end as it did in the book, on a cliffhanger to add even more suspense.  I thought the addition of Frodo's encounter with the Nazgul was a good idea because it helped show how Frodo was slowly falling victim to the ring. But, like many others, I didn't like Aragorn's supposed death and dream sequence with Arwen. That was an unnecessary addition.  Of course, other changes were made from the book, such as the elves at Helms Deep and the way Treebeard and the Ents decided to bring down Isengard.  And Faramir's character was totally distorted from the book. They should have not done this because he was not as seduced by the power of the ring as his brother was.
The cgi effects were awesome.  Gollum and his interactions with real people were realistic.  And I liked the way the Ents looked.  The beasts(not sure what they are) but looked like warthogs on roids were the only really fake looking special effects.  And as I recall in the book it talks of Gandalf fighting the balrog in the caves as an entensive battle.  It would have been nice for the movie to have shown the battle in the caves more.
FINAL VERDICT: I liked it a lot. But, the first film and I expect the last one will be better.  Definitely a must see for all who like fantasy/adventure/sci-fi movies.",Null,0,0,2 February 2003
Across the Universe," a musical nonsense
",I thought this movie was horrible. I have no idea why it was made and the whole point of it. It is about 2 young people who fall in love and some how the Vietnam war keeps them apart and there is also a lot of war protesting involved. Beatle songs are sung all the time. Doesn't really have much to do with what little plot there is.No wonder I had never heard of this film before seeing it on cable. It was a complete waste of time. It was a bunch of hodge podge of songs and visual effects thrown in.FINAL VERDICT: One of the worst films I've seen. There was nothing interesting about it.,1,0,4,25 September 2008
The Incredibles," cute kid tale, excellent visuals
","This was an OK movie, but I'm sure 12 year olds would love it. It has a simple plot we've all seen before. In this, a family of superheros tries to blend into society. But the dad is lured into a trap that was set up by a jealous superhero. So the family, wife and 2 kids, must band together to save each other and the city.The graphics are the star of this movie. I wish Sam Jackson's Frozone would have been in it more. He was cool.This is definitely more adult themed than Finding Nemo. Some of the characters actually appear to die. But, I think it's fine for kids 8 and up.FINAL VERDICT: Entertaining enough. I'm sure kids will like this more than adults.",7,1,1,26 September 2005
The Mist," a horror movie with good character development
","This movie was above average, but I think the ending was too horrible/depressing. Apparently this wasn't the ending in the book, and I think I would have liked the book's ending better. No one wants to think about what David did in the end, especially, to his own son. I mean, couldn't they have at least waited several hours to see if help would come.Mrs. Carmody was a great character, especially towards the end after she has won over most of the supermarket. She turns into the evil one. I'm glad she got what she had coming when she started saying 'take the boy.' Other people in the store played their roles as well. They just weren't in the background. And with so many people, it was not confusing thanks to a good script.The blood and gore is more than you usually see in a Stephen King film. That's another plus for me.FINAL VERDICT: One of the better horror films I've seen in a while. Much better than some slasher flick like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remakes. Worth seeing.",7,2,7,24 November 2007
Driven," not as bad as I thought it would be
","Driven had pretty good car racing scenes. It certainly wasn't one of the worst films of 2001. My ONE big complaint is `Where are the cute guys?'  I mean, we get Burt Reynolds and Sly Stallone, who would look like dried up prunes without that thick movie make-up.  And the guy who played Jimmy Bly had nothing that sparked my interest.  And WHY do they always put ridiculous love stories in the middle of an action film.  It just ruins the most interesting thing about the movie.(SPOILERS):  The scene where Jimmy hops into one of those racing cars and Joe follows is absurd.  First of all, anyone driving close to 200 mph weaving between traffic and going the wrong way would get killed pretty quickly.  And when Joe hops into that car, wouldn't he need a key or something to start it.  Not to mention, those 2 would have been arrested. But all that happens is they get fined by the racing organization. Also, those crashed they show look absurd because if that really happened, onlookers would get killed in the stands by the dozens.  I mean, those cars where flying hundreds of feet.  And of course, Jimmy had to make a play for his rivals girl.  With all those girls pinching his a**, he only wanted to go out with the one that was in love with his rival.  And then the rival turned out to be descent, so there is no bad guy to root  against. (END OF SPOILERS)
I mean when you say the best actor in the film was Sly Stallone, that ain't exactly a good thing.  At least his speech could be interpreted in this.
FINAL VERDICT:  Car racing fans will enjoy, but if you are not one, like me, don't waste your time.  There are plenty of other so-so movies that have cutier guys to watch for 2 hours.",5,1,3,28 May 2002
I Am Legend," not much fun
","I read the book a couple of years ago and from what I remember, this movie is completely different from the book. I thought the movie was rather boring and very dull, especially in the beginning. Who wants to see Will Smith driving around in a deserted city talking to a dog.Also, the special effects are horrible. The cgi lions and deer looked so fake. And all the darkseekers appeared to be cgi too. Computer generated enemies just don't seem that scary.The ending was so flat. I didn't care for it. How does the blast not kill the 2 survives who are hiding behind that door? Why doesn't Neville go along with them.FINAL VERDICT: Not scary, just dull. I didn't think the book was that good and the movie is worse.",4,4,6,8 October 2008
The Bourne Legacy," entertaining secret government project flick
","I thought this was a good film. The government has a secret project that is going on and that is enhancing soldiers with physical and mental pills. Well the government has decided they want to end the project, so in order to do that they have to get rid of all involve.Meanwhile, one of these soldiers, Aaron is hiding out in Alaska and is running out of pills. He meets another like him and witnesses his execution and knows people are after him. In Maryland, some scientists are gunned down that were working on the project, with one surviver, Marta. So Aaron tracks her down, saves her, and is wanting her to get him pills. She reveals a startling fact about his condition and then they travel half way around the world to find the answer that Aaron needs in order to survive.FINAL VERDICT: I thought it had an entertaining plot and some good action. Check it out.",7,4,7,22 July 2013
22 Jump Street," worst movie of the year
","This movie was terrible. I can't say one good thing about it. There was absolutely nothing funny about it. I like both Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, but they were awful in this. Even the whole drug plot was just dumb.Action scenes were just lame and even the bad guys were just so unoriginal. And having 2 cops jealous of each other while undercover in college. I think a 9 year old could have written a better story. I mean who came up with the octopus in the beginning, terrible.FINAL VERDICT: Perhaps the worst big budget movie in a long time. Don't waste 2 hours of your life.",1,5,11,5 April 2015
School of Rock," so bland, so boring, so dumb
","I liked some of the songs and music in this movie, and that is the only good thing I can say about it. Jack Black isn't funny. In this, he plays a loser who gets kicked out of a band. He impersinates his roommate who is a substitute teacher. So, he goes to this fancy, private elementary school to teach for a couple of weeks. At first, he tells the kids just to have recess all day. But, then after hearing them in music class, he decides to form a band with the kids in order to enter the battle of the bands contest.So, he assigns jobs for all the kids. And I ask, how could no one in the school hear a couple of electric guitars and drums being played several hours a day. Then the movie has the very stereo-typical students who are fat or not popular and being encouraged, in this case by Black, to go out and prove they are not losers.Joan Cusak plays the rule obsessed principle, and Black sort of becomes friends with her. I guess they didn't have the two hook up since Cusak is so old. But, I found this film boring and not funny. It seemed sort of like kindergarden cop, where we have someone becoming a teacher who has no business being one.FINAL VERDICT: I guess teens may like it and those who love rock. But, I don't recommend it because it not only did it not make me laugh, it never made me smile.",Null,0,1,12 November 2004
Cars 2," car spy caper
","I liked this movie and thought it would be cute for kids and adults. It's sort of like a James Bond spy car movie. I also liked that the main character this time was Mater, the hick tow truck. I think Mater's voice is very funny sounding and I just like the dumb remarks. Mater joins his best bud, Lightening Mcqueen, on a trip around the world as Mcqueen is racing in a world car race. Mater is mistaken for a spy and is put in some funny situations. And the 2 cars that are the good ones, working with Mater were cute too. And I thought the whole plot of why the one car went bad was OK, it made enough sense.FINAL VERDICT: It's cute, check it out.",7,0,2,8 May 2012
Kick-Ass," a somewhat disturbing yet entertaining movie
","This movie was pretty cool. Although it does feel disturbing because there is a little girl, that looks about 12, that murders, maims, and brutally kills people left and right and has no remorse.The movie is about a high school boy, Dave, whom wonders why there are no real life superheros, so he decides to invent one, Kick Ass. Only problem is he is a complete wimp whom has no fighting skills. He lucks out and saves a guy from some punks and it's caught on camera. He becomes an internet sensation. Soon he gets the affections of the girl he likes, slight problem is she thinks he's gay.There is the big bad crime boss, Frank, whom thinks Kick Ass is messing with his dealings. However it really is Big Daddy and Hit Girl, otherwise known as the killing machine. Those 2 have some good fight scenes and Hit Girl has to save Daddy and Kick Ass at the end and Kick Ass finally gets some guts and does something to help out.FINAL VERDICT: Pretty good, I'd say it's targeted for teens.",7,2,4,9 February 2012
Unknown," it had me guessing all the way
","I'm not good at guessing plot twists, and I certainly never guessed this one. That's why I thought it was good and entertaining.Liam Neesom(Martin), whom seems to be the new older action hero, has come to Germany with his wife, Liz, for a science conference. He leaves his wife to check into the hotel while he goes back for a suitcase left at the airport. His taxi crashes into the river and he is saved by the driver, Gina. He awakens from a 4 day coma and wonders why his wife is not there. He finds her at the hotel, but she says she doesn't know him. Plus, there is another man that has taken his place. He has no identification to prove he is Dr. Martin Harris.Martin thinks he may be loosing it so goes back to the hospital for tests. A nurse there gives him a name of an investigator. A strange man interrupts his MRI and kills the nurse. Now Martin knows he's being hunted. He tracks down Gina but so do the assassins. We get some cool car chases and action scenes as Martin tries to find out what's going on.He gets his suitcase back and meets an old friend and finally understands. Now he has a chance to right a wrong.FINAL VERDICT: I thought it was exciting. I recommend it, it kept me guessing.",7,2,4,3 December 2011
Gran Torino," Eastwood was good...
","even though I wouldn't call this a great film. It was OK, a little slow paced but entertaining enough. Eastwood plays Walt, a recent widow whom still lives in the old neighborhood surrounded by foreigners. He's racist and mean. What I really didn't like and didn't think very realistic was when they would show him growl and grimace at people just because of the way they looked. It was over the top. The movie is about him learning tolerance and befriended his Hmong neighbors. He befriends the young girl there, Sue and her brother, Thao. Thao has a cousin in a gang that keeps trying to get him to join and Walt becomes involved. Walt is shown going to the doctor and spitting up blood. The movie never says what is wrong but it's safe to bet he had some kind of bad disease, so that is supposed to make it better for what happens in the end to Walt.FINAL VERDICT: If you don't mind the language, worth checking out.",7,0,7,8 December 2009
Shrek the Third," Third Shrek running out of ideas
","I didn't think this movie was that good. I really didn't think the second sequel was that good either. The problem with Shrek is it's a one trick pony. The first movie was great because it was fresh and original. Now, all the sequels do is repeat the same formula and it's just not that funny any more. What little plot there is concerns Shrek going to find Arthur who can take the place of the dead King because Shrek doesn't want to. Prince Charming wants to take over Far Far Away so gets the villains from various fairy tales to help him. The drama is can Charming be stopped and will Arthur want to take over.Also, even Donkey doesn't have any great lines any more. This should be the last one, but I see a fourth sequel is in the works. I am glad I didn't pay to see this but as long as people keep taking their kids to the theater to see these sequels, I guess they'll keep making them.FINAL VERDICT: It has a short running time, but still not worth spending a little over an hour to watch.",4,1,2,2 June 2008
The Hurt Locker," OK story but not best picture material
","I like war movies to begin with, so I liked this movie, but I didn't think it was anything special. The movie follows a bomb squad during their last weeks in Iraq. So, since they are disarming bombs, there's not a lot of fighting or blood. It's mainly about one soldier, James, whom seems to have a death wish, putting his life and others at risk. He disobeys orders, which he would have been court marshalled for that, but not so in the film.The movie is supposed to have lots of suspense, which I didn't think it did. Sure, you would be nervous if a bomb would go off unexpectedly, but you figure, since this is a movie, not everyone will make it.FINAL VERDICT: I think people whom also like war movies should see this.",7,0,1,29 September 2010
K-19: The Widowmaker," All the drama seemed so Hollywoodized
","K-19 was no where near as bad as reviews made it out to be when it was in theaters.  And I didn't find Harrison Ford's accent to be bad or that annoying.  The problem is I don't think the real story of this sub was interesting enough for 2.5 hour movie.  A lot of the conflicts seemed made up and they probably were.  Like the part with the tension between the two captains.  The attempted mutiny.  The part where the new captain decides to go go as deep as the sub will go just to test it. I doubt all that really happened.  Then, I also wonder if those sailers really volunteered to go into the nuclear reactor room.  I think it would be more likely they were forced to at gun point.Finally, what was up with the big, fat, fake, noses on the elderly Ford and Neeson at the end.  If you are going to give someone a fake nose, then why aren't they wearing it throughout the entire film.FINAL VERDICT: Way to long for the subject matter. It would have been better just to make this a TV movie for the history channel. It probably would have been more faithful to the real story then.",Null,0,1,9 January 2004
Moulin Rouge!," This was great
","I loved this movie. I wish I  would have know it was so good, and I would have saw this at the theater. I normally don't like musicals, so I wasn't expecting much. The very beginning was confusing, but once they got to the Moulin Rouge, it started getting good. The story was great. For those that didn't like this, how about paying attention and you might change your mind. This isn't just some MTV video. It had a great love story with a sad ending. The use of the all the pop songs added to the story and were even funny like the 'Like a Virgin' number. Both lead actors were great. I was surprised Nicole Kidman didn't win the oscar. And Ewan McGregor should have been nominated. Both sang well also.
(SPOILERS): My favorite part is when Christen is in Satine's room to give his poetry reading and she thinks he is the duke. Satine keeps talking about the 'naughty words' and carrying on like that. That was so funny, I couldn't stop laughing.  Then, I loved the 'Your Song' number and the 'Spectular, Spectular' song and dance that came shortly thereafter.
FINAL VERDICT:  This is a great movie and a great love story. Watch it several times, and you will enjoy it even more.",10,3,4,20 July 2002
X-Men: Apocalypse," At least it had a plot that made sense
","I'm not a big fan of the XMEN movies, my favorite is still the first one. And now hey have to make all the characters younger. In this movie, some sort of alien/god/mutant is awoken. He's been trapped since ancient Egypt times. He recruits a few mutants, including Magneto, to help him. He has a plan to disarm the world of nuclear weapons, then Earth will be easier to defeat. So all the good guys at Xavior's school must learn to use their power It enters around Jean and Scott, so as usual, there are cool special effects with mutant powers. I liked the freezing time when the school was exploding. And of course you know who will prevail.FINAL VERDICT: OK, mutant powers are cool, worth a view.",6,1,3,17 March 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," As far as I'm concerned...
","Toby McGuire will always be Spiderman. I wasn't expecting much since I didn't think the last Spiderman was very good and I got about what I expected. And this time, I thought the special effects weren't even that good because it was just too cartoony looking. With all the Matrix slow-mo and Spidy dodging bullets and flying around, it just looked more like animation.In this sequel, Spiderman faces Electro and the Green Goblin yet again. One thing, they could have had anyone play Electro because most of his screen time is when he's been transformed and blue and not even looking like a real person. No need to give Jamie Foxx a big pay check. And could they have had anymore ridiculous, fake looking electric eels.And about half the film is Peter and Gwen's 'sticky' relationship situation. It just makes for a boring storyline. Also Electro has no real motivation for hating Spiderman other than Spidy forgot his name. Just silly. At least Harry got a good costume for the Goblin this time.FINAL VERDICT: Don't pay to watch this. I saw it on cable. I think it is only good for background noise. I wouldn't recommend anyone run out to see it.",5,0,3,10 March 2015
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," I don't think these films are very interesting
","I thought Twilight, the first film, was OK; however, I thought the plot to this movie was boring. The lead guy, Edward, is gone most of the film. And all we see is Bella being depressed and doing dangerous things in order to have visions of Edward. Then Jacob, the werewolf, doesn't do a whole lot. He spends half the film falling all over Bella and the other half telling her to leave him alone while being shirtless.As for the special effects werewolves, half the time they looked huge and in other scenes looked just a little bigger than a dog. Also, so much more should have been done with the werewolves.Then I thought the ending was horrible. Bella and Alice go from her bedroom to Italy in a few seconds to rescue Edward. It didn't make any sense. Maybe the book is clearer.FINAL VERDICT: I don't think these films are good and not worth the time to watch.",4,6,9,12 January 2011
The Illusionist," too easy to guess the twist
","This movie really wasn't that great. First, it is to easy to guess what happened to Sophie when she is seen riding off slumped over on her horse by Inspector Uhl. If a movie is about illusion, then doesn't it make sense her death is another illusion.What I didn't like is the movie makes no attempt to explain Eisenheim's magic tricks. It makes him seem like a warlock. How did he make the 'spirits' appear? And this is more of a love story. Eisenheim love's a girl above his social class. He is forbidden to see her as a boy. He eventually travels the world and learns his craft. He comes back to win her over. Only problem is she is to marry the crown prince. She can't leave him because the prince would hunt them down and kill them. So, Eisenheim must come up with a plan to keep the prince from trying to find them.FINAL VERDICT: The illusions performed were just to much on the supernatural side. Plus Ed Norton is too old to play Jessica Biels' love interest. I didn't think they had much chemistry.",5,3,4,23 July 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," just a little better than the first film
","This movie was very average. The special effects were OK, certainly nothing great. The story may have been a little better than the first film, but still it's nothing great. An alien, referred to the Silver Surfer, because he gets his power from a surfboard comes to earth. They learn that once the surfer is on a planet for 8 days, that planet is destroyed. The surfer is far more powerful than the fantastic 4, but they devise a plan to separate him from the surfboard. Dr. Doom comes back and very predictably is after the surfboard. They learn the surfer really doesn't want to destroy earth, but is forced to by another entity. The fantastic four persuade the surfer to help them out and try to save earth.The acting is not very good, and there is no suspense. It's just not well written.FINAL VERDICT: Not really worth seeing. I just saw Transformers, and it's a much better film, both in plot and special effects.",5,0,1,17 May 2008
Transformers," the nearly 2 and a half hours just flew by...
","because it was so entertaining. I finally saw Transformers and it was much better than I thought it would be. The special effects were awesome. The robots looked real, as though taking up space. I also loved how they incorporated lots of humor. That's what made the movie for me. From the songs the car picks to play with Sam and Mikaela, to the sector 7 agent, and Anthony Anderson. To many funny scenes to name. Humor plus action makes for great film, especially if it has a long running time. This movie used the same formula that made Spiderman so great.I liked the lead actors in this. In a action movie, you usually don't really care for them, but Shia and Megan work great in this. It's been a while since I've seen a 2 plus hour movie that didn't seem like it was way too long. One criticism I had was at times, it was just too loud, a signature of Michael Bay films. Tone down the hard rock music.FINAL VERDICT: Great action flick. Check it out.",9,1,3,14 May 2008
Men in Black II," The success of this movie at the box office...
","really shows how the majority of teens just want to watch something stupid. This movie was awful, boring, and had the dumbest plot every.  The acting was awful as were the special effects for such a big budget movie. The spiders in 8 Legged Freaks looked much better.  Here the little head behind Johnny Knoxville was just not up to pair with special effects from recent films.FINAL VERDICT: Do not, I repeat do NOT pay any money whatsoever to see this. I saw it because it came on cable.  I spent the entire time looking at the clock even though it is shorter than 90 minutes because it was just so boring.  Please do not support the making of any more stupid movies like this one.",Null,0,1,24 June 2003
Wimbledon," does anyone really care about tennis?
","In the US, not really. The problem with this movie and why no one saw it in the theater is tennis is boring. This is just your generic romance film with the setting being Wimbledon. Girl falls for guy her father doesn't really approve of. They separate but get together in the end. And this is not a comedy. I thought it would have a few laughs, but it doesn't. Also, I thought Paul Bettany was way too old for Kristen Dunst. So, I didn't care for them as a couple. And there weren't any memorable scenes.FINAL VERDICT: I can't imagine anyone thinking this is very good unless they are obsessed with tennis. So, don't watch it unless you always watch 'breakfast at Wimbledon'. You've been warned.",3,1,3,7 July 2005
Magic Mike XXL," how did the script get approved?
","The whole story line behind this movie was awful; how did it ever get the green light. It's basically a road trip with male strippers to one last final shin dig. Of course they have car trouble and must reach out to an old acquaintance for help. They do this at a house full of male strippers. Then there's the girls they meet on the beach.There is one good scene in this and that is at the convenience store and involves smiling, a bottle of water, and Cheetos.The ending is their new dance routine at the stripper convention. It's eye candy, just not interesting.FINAL VERDICT: Don't watch the movie, just watch the convenience store scene online.",3,0,0,26 February 2016
Lincoln," a snooze fest
","I was surprised at how awful this film was considering it won and got nominated for a lot of awards. I mean, I think the movie where Lincoln battles vampires was better than this.This was one of the most boring films I have ever seen and it was just so long. The one high light was Daniel Day Lewis, whom definitely deserved the acting awards. He was very good and looked just like how Lincoln is portrayed. But the whole political process about getting slavery abolished was just so boring in this boring. The history channel could do a documentary on this subject and make it much more interesting.FINAL VERDICT: I think this movie is just too boring for most people, not worth your time.",2,2,5,20 November 2013
Children of Men," I thought it was a mess
",I thought this movie was terrible. It's about 20 years in the future and for some reason women can't have children any more. It's never explained why. Fighting is going on around the world and Britain is the only stable society. Theo is recruited by a clandestine group to help smuggle this girl he later learns is pregnant. How did she get pregnant when other women can't? Never explained.One question I had who is fighting who? We see soldiers with tanks and guns bombing buildings. What do they have against those people and why do they want to fight the army? Makes no sense.Plot and character development are awful. The action scenes aren't even good.FINAL VERDICT: Avoid at all costs.,1,37,69,19 October 2007
Million Dollar Baby," the end was depressing, but the film was very good
","One thing that really stands out was this movie has an original plot. And all the actors were great and deserve all the awards and nominations. There are some very realistic boxing scenes and a lot of them are short since the matches don't last long.The story starts out showing Frankie, an old good boxing trainer who is afraid of risks. We learn he goes to mass every day and it has something to do with his relationship with his daughter. We never learn what happened. Along comes Maggie who wants Frankie to train her. She is too old and comes from white trash, but all she wants is her chance to prove she can fulfill her dream of being a boxer. Eddie helps manage Frankie's gym and sees that Maggie is searching for something. He sort of pushes Frankie to train her. Eddie looks over everyone and he narrates much of the story. Frankie finally gets Maggie matches, and she wins them all. He's afraid to take a chance and book someone good, but finally gives in, and Maggie wins. Finally, Maggie fights the best female fighter who also fights dirty. This boxing match is my one complaint because any fighter that hits someone while they are down or well after the bell would be disqualified and probably banned from boxing for a while. Well, this dirty fighter does all this. And she hits Maggie a second time after the bell. This punch is the worst thing that could happen. Maggie hits her head on a chair and it snaps her neck. She is now a quadriplegic. Frankie is the one who cares about her and sees her every day. Her white trash family shows up only for her money. At least, Maggie sees them for what they are. It is one of the best scenes of the film. Maggie tells Frankie she got to live her dream, and she wants to be able to remember it. She doesn't want to spend her days not being able to do what she loves. She asks Frankie to end her life. Frankie prays at church and is very torn over this issue. Frankie makes the choice I didn't think he would make.FINAL VERDICT: I highly recommend this. It isn't about boxing. It does start out sort of slow, but this is a great character film and you shouldn't go in expecting a lot of action. The ending is sad and depressing.",9,1,3,8 February 2005
Garden State," a quirky love story
","This film was about a loser wanna-be actor, Andrew, who returns home to attend his mom's funeral. We learn he's responsible for his mom's disability and lived a screwed up life as a kid all doped up on psych meds. His dad's a psych doctor, but they can't communicate. He stays for a few days and hangs out with some old friends, one who is a pothead and the other is a millionaire from an invention. He meets a girl, Sam, and they talk and soon he is going to her house. They spend every day together. She's quirky in a good way, with her pet cemetery and habitual lying, and soft helmet.So, the ending is predictable. Andrew must choose to leave or stay with his new relationship.The acting and story were OK. I didn't think the plot was original enough to call this great.FINAL VERDICT: If you like indie films, you'll probably like this. It doesn't have any thrills but tells an every day story.",6,0,1,28 July 2005
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," It may be based on a video game...
","but I find the story line exciting. The sequel begins with a little back story of how the first movie ended. Then it picks up with Alice walking the streets of Raccoon City. I don't follow the video game, so I don't know if this film is following the game story line, but I liked where the movie headed. Alice meets up with another hot bad *ss chick, Jill Valentine, and some STARS members as they fight to find a way out. They are given an offer by one of the Umbrella's scientists- if they find his daughter, they can escape on a helicopter.During this time, Umbrella activates the Nemesis project, who turned out to be really cool. Nemesis is the guy from the last movie who's been turned into a monster. The monster makeup looked cool. My only complaint is the movie needed more Nemesis footage. The two fights between him and Alice were kick *ss. Who knew Milla could be so tough! And the ending just left me wanting more. Now there needs to be a third sequel. I want to know what happens when an evolutionized Alice leaves the city.FINAL VERDICT: If you like horror and especially if you liked the first film, then this is a must see. It may be a B-type film, but it's fast paced, and has cool fights, and a bad guy you want to hate.",8,1,2,7 July 2005

I can't say there was a single thing  I liked in this film.  The plot, if that is what you want to call it, was one of the worst ever. It was just a jumbled mess of scenes not related to one another thrown together.  And all this supposed symbolism that people seem to like to find, I just don't get it.  It's just to out there.

","I thought this was an entertaining animated film. First, the animation is great. Merida's hair is amazing. It looks like you could reach your hand out and touch it. All of it was good.The story was pretty good too. Merida loves archery and riding her horse. Then it is announced she must marry the son of one of her father's allies. She doesn't want to do this, so visits a witch and casts a spell on her mom. What she doesn't know is the spell turns her mom into a bear. Then she must make amends and overturn the curse. Once again the animation of both bears was great. And I thought it had a decent ending.FINAL VERDICT: This had some cute laughs and great visuals. Worth a look if you want an animated film.",7,1,2,19 May 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy," fun space movie
","I thought this movie was good. I really liked all the older songs and the comedic relief brought with them. Like the open sequence, when Peter is using rats like a mike and twirling around on a spooky looking crater. The movie is about a magical orb and those trying to obtain it. Peter steels it but then meets greeny, Gamora, whom is trying to steel it from him. Then there is Ronan and Thanos whom both want the orb to be all powerful.Peter, Gamora, and 2 new fellows, Groot and Rocket, are caught by the police and put in prison. But Rocket is known for escaping so a plan is hatched and they bring along massive, Drax, with them whom wants revenge on Ronan. They get the orb while escaping, plan on selling it, till they find out how powerful it is. But of course, Ronan is on their trail leading to a huge battle at the end.FINAL VERDICT: I liked the characters in this and the plot was good. Also good special effects and some funny parts. I recommend it.",7,1,3,18 April 2015
Evil Dead," a retelling that should not have been made
","This remake should not have been made. It pales in comparison to the original and its sequels that had gore, humor, and campy as can be. The main problem is there was not much of a plot. These young 20 year olds go out to a cabin because one of them has a drug problem. The others have decided to keep the druggie, Mia, at the cabin as she goes through withdrawals. But as in the original they find a book and the smart one unleashes a demon.Now if you want lots of blood and gore, then the last 45 minutes are for you. People lose limbs, get jaws cut out, nailed by a nail gun. But the last survivor doesn't go all crazy with the chainsaw. I'm pretty sure the chain saw played more of a roll in the original.FINAL VERDICT: OK, for the gore fan, but the original stands alone. There was no need for a remake.",3,1,3,19 November 2013
The Evil Dead," What happens when 5 morons spend the night in a creepy cabin?
","(BEWARE OF SPOILERS)
Well, watch this movie to find out.  Why is it in horror films when creepy things start to happen, the people always have to go out in the woods alone or go down into the dark basement.  As soon as some door flies open, I'd be out of there.  But of course, in this movie, when Ash's friends start turning into possessed zombies, he just wants to hit them over the head or lock them in the basement instead of getting the ax or chainsaw and dismember them like the tape said too.
There are some jump out of your seat moments and quite a lot of gore. It is more serious than funny. I did think it was funny when Ash knocks the head off his girlfriend and the body falls on him and all this blood just flows all in his face. That was so ridiculous. Just like when he pulls that stick out of the zombie guy's leg and blood gushes out and the guy keels over. And of course, when Scotty gets the ax and really takes it to his girlfriend. Pieces of her are just flopping on the floor and both guys are like 'we should bury her.' What! How stupid can you be to go outside in the foggy, creepy woods when your friends are being possessed by demons.  But the stupid award for this movie goes to Shelly because after being basically 'raped' by a bunch of tree limbs, she still agrees to go back to that cabin after her and Ash find the bridge destroyed, and she doesn't even tell them what happened to her in the woods.  She even gets ready to go to sleep! Who could sleep after that!
FINAL VERDICT: Scary, gory, creepy, some laughs. But this movie isn't a 10. It's pretty good for a B movie. It's worth renting.",Null,0,1,21 August 2002
8 Mile," not a whole lot of excitement
","This movie wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Sure, Eminem is OK in his film debute, but the plot has a lot of slow parts. The big climax was some rap duel.  I didn't really see a whole lot of difference between the two rappers and what they came up with.  Kim Bassinger plays Rabbit's white trash mom. She was OK, but they could have casted a better actress. She looks too good for white trash, and I didn't get her southern accent since this is set in Detroit.  Also, Brittany Murphey doesn't do much. I mean, the movie doesn't even show if she dated Rabbit; it just shows her being some slut by hooking up with Rabbit at his job.And another thing is Eminem looks too old to play his character. You would think Rabbit would be some 20 year old, but Eminem looks 30.FINAL VERDICT:  I would recommend this just because I like stories like this. But, it was slow and boring in parts and not for everyone. If you hate rap music, definitely don't see this.",Null,0,1,24 September 2003
Shrek 2," more of the same but just not as good
","The story picks up where if left off with Shrek and Fiona on their honeymoon. The conflict arises when Fairygodmother blackmails Fiona's dad, the king. She wants her son Prince Charming to be Fiona's husband. So Donkey tags along with Shrek, and they meet up with Puss in Boots who was hired by the king to get rid of Shrek. The three make their way to Fairygodmother's for help, not knowing she's up to no good. Shrek gets a potion that makes him and Fiona human, only to have Charming take his place. So, the ending is up to Shrek to expose the plot of Charming and his mother.FINAL VERDICT: In part 2, Donkey is no where near as funny and neither are the other jokes. It felt forced and lacking excitement, which the first one had. They need to stop here and not make a third one, but I've heard they are already planning it. All these sequels just ruin a great concept. But, watch it if you have to keep following the saga of Shrek.",7,0,0,17 May 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," I've only seen part 1...
","and I really dig it. It's a tale of revenge, this time with a hot, sword toting Uma Thurman, who woke up from a 4 year coma. She was beat up and shot by her former partners, the deadly viper assassination squad, on her wedding day and very pregnant. As with other Tarantino films, this one goes back and forth in time, and this time it really works and is not confusing. Plus, great music is used as usual. And I have to say I really laughed when in the beginning the little girl comes home to find her mom and the bride covered in blood and broken glass, and the mom says the dog did it; also the P#ussywagon truck and when the bride wakes up and takes care of Buck.All the sword fighting was very well done. Uma did a great job with the training it must have took to do all that. I do wish the fight with Lucy Liu would have been longer and a more dramatic death, but the way she dies was funny. And it certainly was not too violent because all the blood and limbs flying were so over-the-top and unrealistic, which is how it was supposed to be. I loved the fight with Gogo because of her weapon of choice.FINAL VERDICT: I can't wait to see volume 2. I highly recommend it, very entertaining and amusing. It's a homage to old kung-fu films with great visuals and cinematography.",Null,0,1,30 September 2004
Saw II," I like movies with twists at the end...
","and this does not disappoint in that department. I think the first Saw was overall a better film and a much more surprising twist. Instead of a delima between people, jigsaw has set up a game involving a group of people who much escape a house that is filling with nerve gas. First, they must find an antidote or they will be die before leaving. Jigsaw is caught early in the film and his interrogation plays a big role in his 'game'. He wants to teach Detective Mathews a lesson. It seems all the people in the house have something in common, they were set up by Matthews by planting evidence. And as part of the game, Jigsaw has included Matthews delinquent son as part of the house game.Once again, there are some imaginative deaths and creepy choices. Do you crawl into a furnace? What about a pit of needles? And the game Matthews must play at the end with the saw blade and being chained to the wall was all the more great.FINAL VERDICT: I recommend it. While not as good as the first, still very entertaining.",7,1,2,17 February 2007
Clash of the Titans," OK story and special effects
","While the acting is nothing to talk about, the movie does have good special effects, but not great. Perseus, a demi-god, sets upon a quest to save a kingdom against Hades and the Kraken. He also has a personal grudge against Hades since he is responsible for his human families deaths.So, he sets out with some soldiers and travels through a desert. There they encounter these mystical people and giant scorpions. Here we get a battle scene that after a while gets old. One of the desert people joins the quest as they go to see these witches to learn how to defeat the Kraken. Then it is off to the underworld and to kill Medusa. The Medusa part was OK, but the special effects could have been better. Then the fall of the Kraken was rather uneventful.FINAL VERDICT: The story definitely could have been better. But it was a descent action flick. I recommend it if an action film is what you are looking for.",6,1,2,12 January 2011
Jurassic World," great visual effects, crap for a story
","If you watch this movie, watch it for the dinosaurs or the hot Chris Pratt, just don't expect a good story or acting. The dialogue was atrocious, especially the 2 boys. The plot was so dull and predictable. Scientists develop a modified dinosaur that has the genetic makeup of many different animals. Hinse it is super smart and wants to kill. Why, who cares, it just does according to the movie.So of course it escapes and you have all these tourists on the island. Park director Claire gets Owen's help to capture the escaped dino. Things don't work out, people get eaten, and you can kind of guess the King of the dinos will be required to defeat the man made monster.FINAL VERDICT: If you love dinosaurs, check it out, otherwise skip it.",6,8,13,24 April 2016
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," a re-imagination of the book
","This movie was pretty good. But I liked the version with Gene Wilder better. I haven't read the book, so I don't know which version is more accurate. But this movie does have some different adventures in the chocolate factory. Plus, Johnny Depp plays an unique Willy Wonka. He's very weird and neurotic. Plus ghostly(fair skinned): I guess from hardly ever leaving the factory. The stories the same with the finding of the golden tickets. The oomp a loomphas are different and they sing these cute songs every time one of the kids has to go. The boat ride on the chocolate river was different. It was neat. But the other kids beside Charlie were bratty as ever.FINAL VERDICT: Still a good children's story. I recommend it.",7,2,4,15 August 2006
The Adjustment Bureau," Fate controlled by watchers....
","I liked the concept. The idea behind this movie was not the same ole same ole. I thought it was original, and I really liked it. Matt Damen plays politician, David Norris. After losing an election, he meets Elise in the bathroom and she inspires him to make a great speech, setting him up to run again. He gets her number, but then the workers of fate intervene. It seems, they let him meet Elise just to inspire the speech, but the Plan says they are not to be together. David works endlessly to change the Plan. He still questions, why can they not be together. Finally, Thompson is sent and lays down the cold hard facts of what his life will be with Elise.Then the ending is David testing fate again and getting some help from one of his watchers. All the traveling through doors was cool.FINAL VERDICT: I liked the imagination it took to write this. And the overall question this film brings up is just what exactly is a higher power doing. Check it out. One of the best films I've seen in a while.",8,1,2,4 December 2011
World Trade Center," no suspense, not dramatic enough
","This story just did not feel dramatic enough to really draw the viewer in. You already know what will happen before hand, but that doesn't make for a bad movie. United 93 was a good movie based on the 9/11 attacks that was good and suspenseful. But this film was no where near as good. The problem is most of the film has the 2 main characters under rubble with not much to do. A lot of scenes show the 2 wives worrying and hoping to get that call that their husbands are OK. There is only so much you can see of that before it starts to get boring. We get the fact that the wives are worried and waiting. It just makes for a boring movie.Overall, I don't think this story was interesting enough to be made into a feature film.FINAL VERDICT: Drab story. Not suspenseful enough. Watch United 93 to see a good movie centered around the 9/11 attacks.",3,0,1,14 September 2007
Black Snake Moan," unique story about the town tramp
","This movie had something different, unique, which in my book, always makes it better than a lot of other movies out there. Christina Ricci plays Rae, the town tramp, whom suffered from childhood abuse. Sam Jackson is Lazarus, a blues player whom finds Rae nearly dead along the side of the road. He sees this as a chance to change Rae's life by putting her though a religious suffering. He finds out about her being such a tramp and wants to change her ways. He comes up with the idea of chaining her to the radiator in his house and caring for her and trying to give her self esteem. He treats her cough and buys her some decent dresses. He memorizes her with his blues playing, and the songs Laz plays in the film are all very good. Rae's boyfriend, Ronnie, returns home after deciding not to go through with enlisting in the marines. And things work out for them in the end. As one complaint I have, the ending is just a little to perfect for both of them considering how messed up emotionally each of them are. I just didn't see a happy little ending for them.FINAL VERDICT: Unique story, interesting film. I recommend checking it out, but for adults only; it does have lots of bad language.",6,2,5,26 May 2008
Black Hawk Down," a realistic war movie
","I like this movie a lot.  The bullets buzzing by and the soldiers in a panic as they get separated seemed so real. I'm also a big blood and gore fan, so we get plenty of that in BHD.  Also, after seeing this film, I wish I had paid more attention when this was really going on in the world.  I remember hearing about soliders being drug in the streets, but I didn't know there was such an interesting story behind the conflict.  The acting was good by everyone. And the director knew what he was doing.  There was a lot of suspense in seeing how these soldiers were going to get out of a tight situation.
FINAL VERDICT:  A very good war movie, but not for the sqemish.  Worth paying $2.50 to rent this.",9,0,1,29 May 2002
The Hangover Part II," more of the same raunchy humor
","I didn't think the first film was anything great, so I was surprised that I thought this sequel was OK. A lot of sequels are a lot worse than the original, but I thought this one was about the same.The same cast of friends go to Thailand for Stu's wedding. There they are drugged and get smashed and wake up in Bangkok with a monkey and Mr. Chow from the first film. This time the bride's little brother, Teddy, is tagging along. But the guy's have lost Teddy, so the movie is about them trying to retrace their steps and find Teddy.Stu finds out he did a guy, which is very disgusting. They discover the monkey is a drug dealer. Stu got a crazy face tattoo after starting a huge brawl. They kidnapped a monk. It's just all these crazy things and some male nudity thrown in.FINAL VERDICT: More of the same from the first film. It's OK if you want a movie with gross humor.",6,1,1,16 June 2012
Prisoners," intense dark drama
","I thought this movie was pretty good and had me guessing till the end. Two young girls go missing and Alex is the main suspect, only problem is he has the IQ of a 10 year old, so a lie detector won't work. The father of one of the girls, Keller, confronts Alex and Alex whispers 'they only cried when I left'. So Keller is convinced he knows where the girls are.So, Keller does something very disturbing and dark. He brings the other dad in on it and disturbing images ensue.Toward the end all the pieces begin to fall together. However, this is one of those movies that doesn't have a proper ending and we are left to wonder. I don't like that.FINAL VERDCIT: Good thriller, worth seeing.",6,0,1,14 May 2014
Logan," an unnecessary movie
","This movie has nothing to do with X-men besides the names of 2 characters, Logan and the Professor, Charles. There is no humor and it is excessively violent. And it is just plain boring. Logan is aging and keeping the Professor safe. Then some how this woman whose escaped from Mexico with a mutant child that was made by the government finds him and wants him to take the girl , Laura. He doesn't want to but the girl hitches a ride when he visits the Professor and of course he says they must help her.Then the middle of the film is a road trip , where they are getting followed by the bad guys and at this family's farmhouse, they catch up to them and there is a clone of Logan. Just silly. The Professor meets his demise, but the girl has grown on Logan so he takes her to the Canada border where they meet other mutant children. Then of couse, there is a finally battle with the bad guys.FINAL VERDICT: Ruins other x-men films. It is too long and boring, skip it.",3,5,13,6 October 2018
Hotel Transylvania," the story has been done before, but I really liked the animation
","The best thing this movie has going for it is the animation. I thought it was really good, not as good as Pixir, but good. The story is a little dated, protective dad wants to keep daughter away from the world and from meeting a guy. Most of the time a princess is involved, but this movie using vampires. Yes, more vampires. So Dracula wants to keep his daughter Mavis from leaving his castle and meeting humans. In order to do this, he builds and fake town and using zombies to act as humans to scare her back. Also, he is throwing a birthday party for her and all his monster friends are at the castle. Then an uninvited guest shows up, Jonathan, a human. So Drac has to do all these funny things to keep the other monsters from noticing that Jonathan is human. All the while, Mavis is enjoying Jonathan's company and hearing about his travels. So of course, eventually the gig is up, but all the monsters come together to do what is right.FINAL VERDICT:I liked the animation and the film had its funny parts. I thought it was entertaining and I bet 10 year olds would really love it. Worth a viewing.",7,1,2,30 June 2013
Big Fish," not as good as I thought it would be
","I thought this film would have more laughs and be more entertaining. It is about a guy, who goes home to see his estranged father who is gravely ill. He resents the fact that his dad liked to tell him tall tales as a child. Now that's a real reason not to talk to your father for years. So the movie relives of his dad when his dad was young. It shows how he left town with a giant, joined the circus, and how he got his wife to marry him. And how he went to war and bought a town. The part with the giant was probably the best because it was the most laughable. You could see how the son wouldn't believe that. But most of the stories told were so-so and nothing great.FINAL VERDICT: The general idea behind the movie was good, but the stories shown in the film weren't all that great. If they were going to have a movie about tall tales, then make some of them really out there. That would have been more entertaining. So, I don't recommend this one for anyone who is looking for a fun film to watch.",5,1,3,8 December 2004
The Dark Knight," not as good as all the hype
","I really wanted to see this in the theater;however, I never did last summer. Instead I waited till it came on cable, and after watching it; I really didn't miss anything by not going to the theater. I was rather disappointed because I was expecting this to be as good as Spiderman, but I don't think it was. I thought it was rather slow moving with sparse action scenes. I mean Batman on the chopper really wasn't that much action. A lot of films have had better car chasing scenes then that.And I really didn't think Heath Ledger was anything special in this. His role was just a lot of hype. Probably the best role was by Aaron Eckhart and the special effects with his face at the end.I also have to comment on Christian Bale's Batman voice. What was he trying to do?? He sounded like a chronic smoker with emphysema.FINAL VERDICT: It was good, just not as good as advertised. I don't get why so many people thought it was the best comic book movie to be made.",7,18,35,16 June 2009
Everest," true story of one of life's biggest challenges...
","climbing a mountain. We follow a couple of groups of mountain climbers as they spend time at the base camp of Mt. Everest before trying to reach the summit. The getting to know everyone part was OK. Then the day arrives to climb and of course, things don't go as planned. First ropes weren't set up as they should be, there isn't enough full oxygen containers, and a fast storm moves in. One climber goes blind up there. But they just take to long to get to the top and don't keep to the schedule as when they must start going down. So many of them perish while a few make it. You could say some of them were selfish because getting to the summit was more important, putting others at risk. But it's a dangerous hobby anyway.FINAL VERDICT: Good story. I liked the lead guy, he was just stupid not sticking to the schedule. Worth watching.",7,0,1,1 August 2016
Friends with Benefits," unimaginative story line
","There have been several movies come out within the past few years with this same plot idea. And that's the main problem, this movie was so predictable. Basically a guy and girl decide to have a physical relationship with no emotional attachment. And of course, they both fall for each other at the end.In this case, it's Justin Timberlake, Dylan and Mila Kunis, Jamie, whom decide to start getting it on every chance they get, but no dating is involved. Woody Harrelson is thrown in for a little comedy, as Dylan's gay co-worker. But nothing new is really offered by this movie.FINAL VERDICT: If you are a big Justin or Mila fan, I'm sure you'll want to see it, but otherwise skip it.",5,0,1,23 March 2012
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," one of the better Potter films but....
","still too much left out from the book. I thought this fifth installment of Harry Potter was better than the first few. But, after having read the book, I know that there is a lot left out. All these books should have been given 4 plus hours like the seventh book will be. Then maybe all the great smaller story lines would not end up on the cutting room floor. The movie left out a lot of what Kreacher did and there is no quiddich for Harry to get banned from. A lot of the back ground of Bellatrix Lestrange is left out of the movie. That was a very interesting part of the book. Where the book focuses on why Harry got attacked by the Deatheaters in the beginning and the increasing power of the Dark Lord, the movie seems to center around Dorlos Umbridge and her taking over Hogwarts.Pluses are the battle between Dumbledoor and Voldermort was cool. And I liked that they included a little of the Dursley's in the beginning. Too bad more wasn't included because that is often the funniest parts of the books.FINAL VERDICT: If you've seen the first 4, then you should watch the final 3 films. The movies are OK, but I highly recommend reading the books.",7,0,1,23 June 2008
Into the Wild," about a free spirited college grad with some beautiful scenery
","Personally, I think Chris was crazy to do what he did and also it was very cruel of him not to at least call or write his family so they knew where he was. Shortly after graduating college, Chris decides to give away his money and go on a road trip without telling anyone. His car gets washed out in the desert and from that point he walks everywhere. He lives off the land and gets a little help from others by hitchhiking. He travels everywhere and gets a job driving a tractor to make a little money for his quest to Alaska. He also meets two hippies a couple of times who help him. He breaks this old guy's heart by leaving since he was his only friend. Chris also takes a journey in a kayak all the way to Mexico. He finally ends up in Alaska and stays the winter in the wilderness. When he tries to leave, the river has flooded and he is stuck. Chris meets his demise in the wild due to eating poisonous plants.He wrote down most of his journeys so that is how his family was able to piece together what he did after leaving them. I thought it was sad for his family since he never called them. He may have been angry with his parents but considering what he did, I don't think he's a sympathetic character.There was nothing great about the acting. Only the outdoor scenery was about average. Otherwise, not a whole lot happens in the film.FINAL VERDICT: I guess if you like backpacking and camping, you may find this movie more appealing; however I didn't think it was that great. Not enough of a plot for me.",6,1,3,16 June 2009
Blood Diamond," conflict diamonds make for an....
","interesting subject. This movie was much better than what I was expecting. Leo Dicaprio is really good in this as well as Djimon Hounsou. Djimon should have won the Oscar for his role. Leo plays Danny Archer, a diamond smuggler, whom has his eye set upon a huge payoff that will help him get out of Africa. He over hears a rebel accuse Solomn Vandy of finding a large pink diamond. Danny persuades Solomon to take him to the diamond, In return Danny helps him track down his family in a refuge camp. Danny also gets help from a journalist whom he has a thing for. There track across country is very dangerous with the rebels every where.The ending was good. It was how it should be. The movie was action packed but informative about some of the things going on in Africa. One of the most entertaining films of the year.FINAL VERDICT: Highly recommend it.",9,3,4,11 October 2007
Pride & Prejudice," OK, nothing really new
","This movie is like many other romance films out there; only difference is it's set in England in the olden days. I'm not sure why Knightly got acting nominations. I didn't think it was anything special. She didn't even have to fake an English accent. The main story is girl likes boy, boy likes girl, girl gets mad at boy, then finds out he isn't so bad after all, and takes him back.On a side note, I thought it was really annoying for almost everyone to refer to someone else as Mr. or Mrs. instead of first names. The wife calls her husband Mr. Bennett and the kids even call their parents Mrs. or Mr.FINAL VERDICT: OK; just nothing original. If you like date movies, you may like this.",5,1,12,7 September 2006
Puss in Boots," OK story, but not enough humor
","I thought this movie was OK, but no where near as good as the Shrek films, mainly because there was very little humor. It just wasn't funny, but the animation was very good. It's about Puss trying to find magic beans to get the giant's golden eggs. He's got Kitty Softpaws as an alli and Humpty Dumpty wants to redeem himself. Jack and Jill are his advisories.I guess kids would like this plot, but I didn't think it was that great. I think adults would get bored by this. It needed to be more entertaining with funnier situations.FINAL VERDICT: Just for kids.",5,0,4,7 August 2012
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," The best part of this film was its originality
","This movie was very original, which is why I thought it was OK. I didn't think the concept was anything that great though. It's basically a romance. But instead of showing the two meeting and falling for each other in the conventional way, it's all shown in memories as they are being erased. In the film, there is technology that can erase memories. Joel learns his ex-girlfriend, Clemetine, had him erased, so he goes to have the same procedure done to him. But, during the procedure, part of him doesn't want to lose all the memories. So, most of the latter part of the film shows things that Joel and Clementine did together. And once Joel realizes he doesn't want her erased he begins dragging Clementine throughout his memories and trying to hide her. It's rather weird, but the way it's shown makes sense.The side plot involves the employees from the memory erasing place. Mary finds out something about her and the doctor and it changes the way she feels about the procedure. And somehow Joel and Clementine meet again after their memories were erased and start hanging out together. Then each gets an interesting piece of mail that leads to the conclusion.I'm not sure why Kate Winslet received so many acting nominations. I didn't think any of the actors did anything exceptional.FINAL VERDICT: I give it props for originality, but it's not a great story. But, I do recommend it if you want to see something new.",5,0,2,18 April 2005

","This is another movie about a futuristic Earth and it's in shambles. But the rich are living on a space satellite known as Elysium. Matt Damon plays Max, a guy that suffers radiation and is going to die. So he's willing to risk everything for a shot at Elysium. He steals data from some corporate guy that can reboot Elysium and make all its citizens and can be healed.Jodie Foster is the defense secretary whom wants to take over and uses covert killer, Kruger, to accomplish her goals but he turns the table. Now, the biggest question of the film is what accent was Foster using. It was crazy, what was she thinking.Anyways can Max save the day and especially the daughter of his childhood friend.FINAL VERDICT: Poor script and the action scenes weren't even that good. Skip it.",4,1,3,21 April 2014
Taken," since when did Liam Neeson become Rambo
","Neeson's character, Bryan Mills, is referred to Rambo by some of his ex spy buddies in the beginning of the film. And as it turns out, he turns into a sort of Rambo later while trying to find his daughter. Neeson is not an action star, which was the main problem with this movie. It wasn't believable.Mills daughter, Kim, goes to Paris with a friend and gets kidnapped a few hours after arriving. It just so happens she is talking to her dad when the kidnappers strike. So Mills goes to Paris and all by himself he hunts down the Albanians and kills people left and right. Mills doesn't even ask any of his ex spy buddies to help out.Mills ex wife was the worst character. She lies to him to get him to sign the papers to let their daughter go; Plus she doesn't even seem concerned that her 17 year old daughter is going to Europe with one friend. Then when her daughter is kidnapped, she's not going nuts saying call the police. And the ending was terrible when Mills and Kim return home. Her dad just saved her from being a sex slave and she doesn't even want him to come home with her.FINAL VERDICT: It has some good action, but I think the lead actor was miscast. But still good enough to check out.",6,1,3,7 December 2009
Alice in Wonderland," entertaining new version of a children's story
","I liked this movie, but it isn't for really young kids. It would probably scare them. But for older kids and adults, it was very entertaining. The visuals were top notch, and the film included all the main characters Alice meets in Wonderland. I especially thought Tweedle dee and dumb were so cute and deserved more screen time. The other great character was the red queen. Her appearance was perfect and when we see her court are wearing disguises to make them look as unattractive as her, that was funny.The battle between Alice and the Jabberwocky was cool as far as visuals, but we knew how it would turn out. I also liked the humor involving Hamish. It just helped to make the story a little different than other versions.FINAL VERDICT: It's not to long and worth watching.",7,0,2,23 November 2010
The Mummy Returns," The Mummy was great...
","But the sequel has less to be desired.  I saw this film expecting great things, but I was sorely disappointed.  I missed the laughs and the romance that the first Mummy had.  The Mummy Returns wasn't funny and the plot was too convoluted to make any sense. Also some of the CGI critters did not have much appeal. I loved how the mummy looked in the first film.  But in this one, there isn't enough of the original mummy. Instead, we get the Rock with a scorpion body that looked so fake and those little munchkins running around.  And that kid, where do I start.  The word annoying comes to mind. I mean, why couldn't we have just had another film where Rick and Evie go on another adventure together.FINAL VERDICT:  If you want to see a great, funny, interesting adventure movie, watch The Mummy.   My advice is to avoid this sequel because watching the Mummy Returns will only ruin all the great things there is to like about the first one.",5,0,1,28 May 2002
Avatar," amazing effects but nothing new plot wise
","This movie was better than I expected because I thought the story would be horrible. And it wasn't; actually, it's a story that has been used many times. It sort of reminded me of General Custard at Little Big Horn. The bad humans are tired of trying to make nice with the blue aliens and so decide to destroy them. Aliens with their less advanced weapons unite and defeat the bad humans from completely overtaking their world.Sigourney Weaver, plays Grace, a scientist that wants to learn from the Navi and believes that they are one with the forest. Enter, Jake, a marine whom is replacing his deceased brother, as a driver of an Avatar, which is the human/alien/ body that can be controlled by the human's mind. Jake gets lost and is taken in by the Navi, in particular a girl, Neytiri. They teach him the way of life. He is supposed to gain their trust and ask them to leave their land so the humans can harvest this valuable rock that is there.OF course, Jake falls for the girl and wants to help them defend their land against the evil chief of security whom takes over and wants to destroy everything.FINAL VERDICT: It's your typical story that everyone likes, plus cool special effects. It is a little long, but that's why I say watch it at home so you can stop it several times.",7,3,5,9 November 2010
Drag Me to Hell," didn't like it
","I didn't think the plot to this film was anything great, plus it was just weird. This girl, Christine, works at a bank and she has to deny an extension to this old woman on her house. Well, the old woman is some kind of witch. She attacks the girl in her car and pulls a button off her jacket and curses it. The rest of the film Christine has scary visions mostly involving the old woman. The woman bites her, vomits on her, and is even in her piece of cake. The whole curse just didn't make a lot of sense to me.This movie just had some moments in it to make you jump but it wasn't scary nor bloody. Gross if anything.FINAL VERDICT: If you want to check out a recent creepy movie, I would suggest Orphan. This isn't worth your time.",4,1,3,27 May 2010
Grindhouse," Tarentino brings the comedic violence and long dialog
","Grindhouse makes for an interesting set of 2 films. The first one, Planet Terror by Rodrigues, is the better of the 2 films. It is filled with comedic violence and gore. A gas is released that turns people into zombies. Cherry a hot dancer is attacked and taken to the hospital by Wray. She loses her leg from the attack and Wray so elegantly makes her a stump. At the hospital we meet a mean doctor and his cheating wife. The dead are starting to turn into zombies and we get some nice gore shots. The chase leads to a restaurant and a stand off between survivors and the dead. It's great fun.Tarentino's film, Death Proof, doesn't have a lot of action but lots of dialog about interesting silly things. It's like how you would imagine real conversations. It's a Tarentino trademark. The ending is just so right also, with the girls ganging up on Stuntman Mike.FINAL VERDICT: It has some uniqueness about it. And anything involving Tarentino is usually worth watching at least once.",6,0,0,9 March 2008
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Volturi = worst villains in movie history
","I finally got to see the last installment of this franchise and watched them all on cable; I certainly wouldn't spend money to see these films. The movie begins after the birth of Renesmee; Belle and Edward are hot for each other and Jacob creepily has the hots for the baby since he imprinted on her. The Volturi are coming after them because they fear the child is a danger to the life of vampires and can't be controlled, plus it's bad in the vampire world to turn a child. Now does that sound real exciting? So Bella, Edward and the family are going to disappear, then perhaps what is the most perverted scene in a pg13 film, when Jacob strips to turn into a wolf in front of Bella's dad. Jacob does this to keep the family from running away, real sensible, right? So, some vamp tattles on the Cullen family to the Volturi; meanwhile the Cullens gather vampire friends from around the worth to vouch on their behalf that the child isn't a threat. They are afraid the Volturi won't believe that the child is half human and half vamp, which would mean she wasn't a threat, makes perfect sense? Anyways there is a so called 'confortation' which may or may not happen, the end.FINAL VERDICT: Simply awful. The plots to these film are just not good.",2,7,17,14 January 2014
Invictus," once again Morgan Freeman proves he's greatness
","After watching this, I'm surprised Morgan Freeman didn't win the Oscar. I guess because he's won before is why they didn't give it to him. He was great, but I would only say the movie was average. Mainly because the movie was too long and the final half hour was just the rugby match. It went on too long. Plus, as someone whom knows nothing about rugby, it just made it boring watching all those scenes. That should have been cut down to make the film come in at 2 hours. And I'm not sure why Matt Damon got nominated for awards. His accent was awful and seemed to come and go. And his character had few dramatic scenes. What did he do besides tell his team to listen to the crowd singing and a whole country supporting them.FINAL VERDICT: It's long. I recommend it if you want to see a great acting performance or if you are watching it on DVD so you can stop it a few times. I couldn't sit through it in one viewing.",6,0,1,26 October 2010
La La Land," how disappointing
",This movie is boring and I don't understand how it could have won awards and gotten the praise it received. The songs are nothing great. It's not funny. All it is a story of how a struggling actress and musician finally get success after they break up. What's good about that? The ending doesn't make much sense. I guess it shows how Mia's is thinking her life would have been different if they didn't break up.FINAL VERDICT: Don't waste money on this.,2,4,7,21 September 2017
Saw," psychological horror/thriller that pulls out all the strings...
","for those really tense, creepy scenes. I really liked Saw. Sure, it wasn't as good as 7, but it sure beats out all the most recent horror/thriller films over the past few years. The film begins with a doctor, Larry and a photographer, Adam whom are chained in a bathroom at opposite ends. They don't know how they got there. They find tapes in which they play that says Larry must kill adam by 6 in order to save his wife and daughter. So, the 2 find objects and other clues as they try to free themselves. Then flashbacks are seen through out. It seems Larry has an idea who did this, a serial killer named Jigsaw. It seems he was once a suspect in the serial killings. So, throughout we learn about some of the tests Jigsaw has put his victims through and about how he escaped from 2 cops: one of whom has become obsessed with the case.Not much of the tests are shown, but the descriptions about them are enough to make you lose your lunch. There is quite a bit of blood, but the camera cuts away before you get the really gory shots.Then, there is the twist at the end. It was shocking and just floored me. The look on Adam's face after he hears the final tape was just priceless.FINAL VERDICT: If you like thrillers, this is a must see. Now, I can't wait to see the sequel.",8,0,1,10 January 2006
Super 8," Other reviews have said it all.....
","this is basically Goonies meets ET. The film centers around several young teens whom are making a zombie movie and witness a train wreck and accidentally capture some amazing video footage. The military comes in to clean up the train wreck and soon overtakes the town. Also weird things start to happen in the town, like all the dogs run away and microwaves and car engines go missing.The kids know the man whom caused the wreck because he was one of their teachers (BTW how did the teacher survive that, it wouldn't be possible). They find these old videos he had stashed that tell the whole story and what they are up against. So, it's up to them to save one of their own.One thing I didn't get is when the kids are running through the neighborhood, what are all those tanks shooting at. Too much was going on in those scenes.FINAL VERDICT: OK, but not really good enough to recommend.",5,3,4,21 May 2012
The Last Samurai," just another so-so film for Cruise
","While some of the sword fighting scenes were well done, the story still had a lot to be desired. First it is such a clich√© to have our war hero, Nathan, a drunk, but really have a good heart. He fought with Custer and has been haunted by the women and children he killed. He gets an offer to go to Japan to train the emperor's soldiers. During battle, he managers to defend himself while surrounded and the Samurai leader, Katsumoto, decides to spare his life. So Nathan is taken to the Samurai village and cared for by the wife of the man he killed. What doesn't make sense is why does he take this 'kidnapping' so lightly. He is a very violent man, why doesn't he do something crazy. So, of course, he learns to love the Samurai way and chooses to fight for them. And of course they have to throw a silly love interest in being the woman who nursed him.As I said the battles are done OK. I'm surprised it didn't get an R rating. There isn't much blood, but there are a number of people shown getting swords put right through them. But, I'm sure there is much more to the history lesson than is shown on screen. I never tells why the Samurai want to fight and don't want to get along with the emporer. I'm sure the movie paints the Samurai as much more likable than they really were.FINAL VERDICT: It isn't a great epic, so I don't recommend it if you don't like long movies. But, if you really like epics then take the time to watch it because it isn't bad.",Null,0,1,12 December 2004
Snowden," interesting political drama
","This movie is about the famous spy, Edward Snowden, whom now lives in exile in Moscow. The movie starts from the beginning of his career when an injury caused him to get into the computer side of the CIA. He creates programs that spy on people around the world including America. The government can tap into emails, phone calls, anything online gathering data. Problem is the government was doing this without just cause or a court order. And eventually he begins to feel some guilt about it. So, he steals some files that prove the spying and he gives them to the media. And the USA labels him a traitor, but others say he is a whistleblower and should not face criminal charges. The movie ends with him being given asylum in Russia and it says his long time girlfriend moved there.FINAL VERDICT: Good story, asks the question does the government have the right to spy on anyone without just cause? Worth a viewing.",6,0,2,3 July 2017
Rio," very colorful animation with a nice story
","I think Rio makes for a great kids film that adults will enjoy also. I also liked the fact that the animals didn't talk to the people but among themselves. There were a couple of cute songs and lots of famous people doing voice overs. The story revolves around the last 2 blue macrows, a male and female. Blu lives in Minnosote with Linda while Jewel is with an ornithologist, Tulio, in Brazil. Tulio shows up when day and tells Linda they should bring the two birds together to continue the survival of the species. Linda agrees but disaster results when the birds are kidnapped by smugglers. The rest of the movie is about the birds escaping with help from their animal friends and their owners searching also. It had a strong family feeling and ends perfectly.FINAL VERDICT: Worth checking out.",7,0,0,28 February 2012
From Hell," Misleading
","Considering this movie was based on a graphic novel, I was expecting a lot of blood and gore. But, there isn't much of it.  The camera pans over the crime scenes quickly and never lets you have a good view.  You do get to see a couple of throat slashings.  Johnny Depp and Heather Graham are miscast. The director really made a mistake by making all the other prostitutes trashy and filthy looking, while Heather Graham has pretty combed hair and clean looking.  Toward the end, the scene where they reveal 'Jack' and make him have these cold, big black eyes was chilling.  But, most of this movie is slow and boring.
FINAL VERDICT: Don't watch this if you are sleepy because there is not enough action to keep you awake. I do not recommend this movie unless you just want to criticize all the historical inaccuracies and the miscast actors.",Null,1,2,17 December 2002
Invincible," another you can do anything you set your mind too movie
","This story is very uplifting. It's about a 30 year old bartender/layed off teacher, whose wife just left him. He tries out for the Philadelphia Eagles and against all odds, makes the team. Coach Vermeil sticks with Vince because he's got heart, even though his assistant coaches think he should be cut. Vince goes on to play several years in the NFL.The football scenes were shot pretty good. But, I hate how they always have to stick some love interests in the story that doesn't have much to do with the story. Here, they insert another bartender, who eventually dates Vince. It's just a chance for Mark Wahlburg to get a few kissing scenes in.FINAL VERDICT: I didn't think it was anything that is a must see. If you like movies about sports, then you may want to check it out.",5,4,6,11 June 2007
National Treasure," fun adventure
","This was a fun film, sort of like an Indian Jones movie, but the treasure hunter must figure out clues. I'm sure the reason this was made and released now has a lot to do with the Da Vinci Code. The plot is just like it except instead of involving religious history, the clues center around American history, and namely the founding fathers.So Nick Cage, plays Ben Gates, the treasure hunter whose family has been looking for the treasure of the knights templer for years. One of his relatives possessed the last remaining clue from a dying Mason. So, the movie starts with Cage finally solving that clue, and the film goes from there. Of course, we have the evil billionaire guy who wants the treasure for himself and the funny sidekick. But, I think the sidekick failed because he wasn't all that funny. The movie could have used some more humor. And of course, Gates hooks up with a beautiful woman along the way to help him solve the clues, which sounds just like Da Vinci.It is unbelievable that someone could just come up with the answer to these difficult clues after thinking about them for 2 minutes, but we don't have time to let the characters ponder them for a few months. It is meant to be fun, so forget about the plot holes. The whole set beneath the church looked very neat, but I would have to think all those wooden stairs would have been rotten by then and no one could walk on them. But who cares, it's fun.And the theft of the Declaration of Independence was reminiscent of Ocean's 11. Funny how anyone can steal anything in a film, forget locked down security.FINAL VERDICT: If you like adventure films, I recommend it. It is not like Tomb Raider, which some have compared it to. Tomb Raider was horrible. This is more like Indiana Jones.",7,186,249,12 December 2004
How to Train Your Dragon," cool dragons, I'm sure kids would love it
","This was a pretty good animated movie. I really liked the dragons as there are several different kinds that are designed uniquely and are colorful. It's about a Viking boy, Hiccup, that befriends a dragon. The dragon has injured its tail and can't fly out of this valley. Hiccup makes a device to go on the tail that aids the dragon in flying and he also makes himself a saddle. Now he's flying on the dragon and learning that the beliefs about dragons being evil are not true. He's also in dragon killing training school with some other kids. He starts to dominate because he knows what they like and can make them act like pets. Of course hid dad finds out and wants to slay more dragons. Can Hiccup and his friends stop them and save the day? It's a kids film, what do you think.FINAL VERDICT: Cute movie with cool animated dragons, worth a viewing",7,1,4,15 May 2011
The Great Raid," heroic story, good movie
","This was one of the better war movies I've seen. The characters were set up; we learned a little back ground about them. The raid was explained, so we(the viewer) knew what was going to happen. And once the action took place, you could tell who was who since we got to know the soldiers in the beginning. The fighting was violent, but there wasn't many close ups of the actually killings. Not like the violence in Saving Private Ryan or We Were Soldiers.I don't understand why this film didn't do better at the box office. I blame it on the marketing of this film, plus, it was released like a low budget independent film, which it really wasn't. I didn't see it until now, but I wanted to watch it at the theater. I was unable to go the first couple of weeks it was out, and by the time I was ready to see it, I couldn't find it at any local theaters. I guess because it didn't have a big name star attached it got buried in the mass of movies released.Too bad it wasn't given more credit and advertising because it probably was the best movie released last summer.FINAL VERDICT: Compelling, entertaining, informative war story. One of the best films based on the military action in the Pacific.",10,2,4,29 May 2006
The Descent," a gruesome descent
","This was a very good horror movie. The beginning takes time to set up the relationships between the woman. We learn the group of friends like to get together every year to go on a thrilling adventure. This year they are exploring a cave. One of the women, Sarah, is still trying to get over the loss of her family. The movie does this without dragging out the story; hence this part is entertaining not boring.We finally get to the cave exploring. I think it is so creepy to think about crawling around in such a tight place and dragging yourself over rocks and water in the dark. There is no way I would do that. The group experiences a cave in and that's when they learn from Juno, the girl who planned the trip, that she did not lead them to the planned cave. They are exploring a new cave system and no one knows they are there.Instinct kicks in and it's about survival for each individual. Not only are they dealing with the dark and being lost, they got some cave dwellers hot on their trail who are looking for fresh meat. The cave people are somewhat realistic as to how the adapted to the dark and aren't blessed with super human strength.I also liked the creative ways they come up with to have light. Red flares and green glow sticks. When the cave people start attacking, that's when it gets gruesome. Some of the best gore and blood I've seen. Amazing how rock picks can make blood spew. But, I don't buy Juno and Sarah at the end being able to dominate the cave people like that. But it sure was cool.FINAL VERDICT: It's creepy and got lots of blood and guts. If you like those type of movies, you will like this.",8,1,3,2 February 2008
Les Mis√©rables," I liked the actors and story
","I didn't know anything about this story before watching the movie. I thought it was good. All of the songs weren't great, but they were good and told the story. Everyone sings in this, there is very little talking, all the story is told in song. The only negative thing I could say is the story is so depressing. People do not get happy endings in this movie.I thought Russell Crowe was excellent and probably didn't win awards since he has won them in previous films. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter had the best roles. They were the comedic relief and very funny. They just had great characters. And I didn't think Anne Hathaway deserved the Oscar. She was OK, but only in a very small role as her character was only in the very beginning. I just didn't think the role was strong enough to win awards.FINAL VERDICT: If you like musicals, it's a must see. If you want a decent story, then this is a good choice too.",7,0,0,10 September 2013
The Da Vinci Code," glad I didn't see it in the theater
","Once again, another movie that is no where near as good as the book. I read the book a couple of years ago, and I thought it was good and suspenseful. But, partly because I already knew the ending, this movie did not live up to the hype. But it wasn't just that I knew what would happen, but there are just too many slow moving scenes and puzzles seemed boring in the movie. It made a lot more sense and was much more suspenseful in the book.Silas character did not come off that great in the movie. He was much better and scarier in the book. And Hanks and Tautou had little chemistry. It was almost painful to see them together on screen.FINAL VERDICT: If you are interested in the story, read the book and do not see the movie.",5,0,2,4 June 2007
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," too over-hyped; doesn't deliver
","I've read all the Harry Potter books and really liked them. This movie pales in comparison to the books.  Too much is left out of the movie, especially the ending.  The book shows how all 3 kids overcome the challenges by doing what they are good at. And the movie leaves some of that out.  The kids were awful actors.  They must have cast the cheapest kids they could find.
Dumbledore was what I pictured from the book. I also liked the Gobulin Bank, the mirror, and the hidden alley.  It was pretty much like the book. The special effects were good, but that doesn't make up for the slow pace of the movie.  Time just flew by when reading the book.  The quiddick match wasn't that great in the movie either.
FINAL VERDICT: If you don't want to be disappointed, then just read the books.  But if you must watch the movie, watch it on tape so you can stop it to take some breaks because you will need some to be able to stay awake during its slow moving pace.",Null,1,3,3 December 2002
In Time," you must use your imagination ....
","for this to work. In this movie, once a person turns 25, a clock starts on their arm, and that is how much time they have left. There is no money only time. You buy everything with time, from coffee to paying your rent.Will, from the ghetto, meets a suicidal guy that has a century. The guy gives Will his time before killing himself. Will is angry because his mom timed out and he wants to make things more fair. So he goes to new grenwich, which costs a lot of time to get there. By this time, the time police are after him because they think he killed the guy whom gave him his time. Will wins big at poker and is invited to a rich guy's house where he hooks up with his daughter, Sylvia. The cops burst in and he takes Sylvia on the lam with him.So the rest of the movie, the two become sort of like robin hood, stealing time and giving to the poor. I guess the big suspense is will they get caught or run out of time? FINAL VERDICT: OK, but there are always too many plot holes with sci-fi movies. Like where were all the cell phones, and why did the cop cars look like drag racers from the 70s. Anyways, I recommend it for a mindless popcorn flick.",6,0,0,17 July 2012
Thor," I learned something from Thor....
","Chris Hemsworth is very hot. I never noticed him in a movie before, but there is one too short scene of him shirtless, that is not to be missed. Other than that, I thought this movie was OK with the beginning being the best part and I didn't care for the ending. The first 45 minutes was very entertaining with some good special effects. Basically the first part is about Thor's people and their conflict with the frost giants. The frost giants invade and Thor with his other brother, Loki, and friends go to the frost giant land looking to start a war. We see some of the cool powers Thor has with his hammer. But the King is furious and banishes Thor to earth minus his powers and that's when the movie starts to get duller. He meets scientist, Natalie Portman, whom of course he falls for. I thought there should have been funnier scenes between Thor and regular people. He gets in trouble with the Feds, but just gets released, then the ending is this giant robot that is some how controlled by Loki from the other planet. Then the final battle between Thor and Loki, I just thought the latter scenes were not as entertaining.FINAL VERDICT: If you like the comic book movies, then I'm sure you will want to see this.",6,1,1,13 March 2012
The Happening," 1st Knight film I'd call bad
","This was a pretty bad movie. Any time you cast Marky Mark as a school teacher, you know you have some miscasting going on. Was Bruce Willis busy? The premise of the film was interesting. People in New York just sort of go into a trance and then kill themselves. What's causing it? The story focuses on Elliot, his wife, Alma, his friend Julian and his daughter Jess. They are trying to get out of the affected area. Their train stops in a small town and from that point, it's everyone for themselves. They gather with others and track across open fields. But is that the best strategy. One guy they get a ride with seems to think plants may be involved. And at the end, they seek shelter with a crazy old lady.FINAL VERDICT: Not enough suspense, badly written. Not scary. Miscast actors. Knight needs to go back to the drawing board and come up with a good idea like in his first films.",2,2,4,1 June 2009
The Shape of Water," overrated
","I can't believe this movie was nominated for awards and even won some. Just shows how bad movies have gotten. This film was very mediocre and not worthy of all the praise. First, it is too silly and the plot is just so simplistic. It's about a mute lady, Elisa, whom works as a cleaner at a govenment facility. She finds this sea creature/aquatic man that is being held there. Sadistic investigator, Richard, tortures the creature trying to find out it's capabilites. Elisa sees this and starts bringing it food and befriending it. She decides to kidnapp the creature before it is killed. With help from a couple of friends, her plan works. At home, she falls in love with it, sleeps with it, and floods her bathroom. This part is the silliest of all scenes. Of course, she must avoid Richard until she can release the creature. And the ending is just awful, makes no sense. (spoiler), Richard shoots her and creature, the creature expels the bullets, and jumps in the water with Elisa and I guess they just swim off together to be happily ever after?? Not sure how Elisa breathes underwater.FINAL VERDICT: No way is this a good, award worthy film. Just shows how the poor quality coming out of Hollywood nowdays. Not worth seeing.",3,5,11,25 September 2018
The Matrix Reloaded," computer Neo sucks
","The first Matrix was terrific, but in the sequel they decided to get away from what made the first one work. There are too many computer special effects. The slo-mo effect from the first one was so cool. Here, we get a computer Neo that looks so fake when fighting the many Agent Smiths. It looks like a video game.  And most of the fight scenes were boring. We know Neo can beat the agents, plus he can fly, so why would he stick around to fight a hundred of them. I'll give them credit with parts of the car chase scene mainly because the twins were so cool.  Also, when Trinity is driving the motorcycle against traffic, that was filmed so it was thrilling.But, what makes the sequel fail in comparison to the first one is the story. From the start with follow the white rabbit, the first film had me hooked. Reloaded never held my interest, especially the beginning. The whole rave in the cave was so stupid as well as Morpheus speech. And did they need the sterotypical over zealous captain who thinks he's in charge but really doesn't have the answers.  And where was all the cool stuff with somebody telling them in the Matrix where to turn and what to expect to avoid danger. And why hire a known name, Jada Pinkett Smith, when her character does nothing.FINAL VERDICT: Reloaded lost the magic and entertainment the first film had. It's like different people wrote the scripts and with a bigger budget decided computer effects would make a better film, and they were wrong.  So, if you are a big fan on the Matrix, you may not want to watch this one because it will ruin all the great things about the first one.",Null,2,3,3 May 2004
The Fountain," terrible idea
","I admit, I didn't get it. I thought it didn't make sense. I did sort of get the past scenes with Tom as a conquistador and the present as a scientist searching for a cure for his wife's brain tumor. But the future Tom made no sense. Being in outer space, a giant tree, surrounded by a ball; it was plain silly. And why this movie did poorly at the box office. Was it supposed to be the exact same Tom as a conquistador and in the present or just his spirit the same? And what about Izzy? Was it the same woman or spirit or soul or whatever? FINAL VERDICT: I did not like this at all. Definitely one of the worst sci-fi films I've seen in a while.",2,3,8,20 January 2008
Mystic River," the final 15 minutes left me saying....
","huh? I agree with about everyone that the acting was great and definitely deserved awards. But it was too easy to guess who committed the murder. And I am never good at predicting twists, but I got this one right. But the real meat of the movie has to do with the confrontation between Jimmy and Dave at the end. Those were some tense moments.Now to the spoilers: What was up with the final 15 minutes. First of all, all the people in this were nuts. But, then out of no where Jimmy's wife turns into the craziest of them all. Her husband confesses he's a cold blooded killer and all she can do is say she's glad she's the wife of a king. Well, early in the film it implied at one Jimmy was a small time hood, but when he served a short term in prison, he changed his life. It shows him running a store. He has some shady friends, but the movie does not imply he was still involved with any of that. Then his wife talks about him being a king. Like he is at the top of the criminal ladder in their community.Then, why doesn't Dave's wife want Jimmy arrested? And why does Sean not arrest Jimmy or at least Sean's partner, the only sane person in the whole film. Jimmy practically confesses he offed Dave and Just Ray, but Sean doesn't do anything. Then at the end while watching the parade, Sean mockingly shoots Jimmy, why? FINAL VERDICT: It was pretty good till the very end. The nonsense of the final 15 minutes ruined it for me. But, I recommend it just to watch the great acting performances.",7,1,2,12 December 2004
Zombieland," another zombie comedy
","This is another zombie movie written as more of a comedy with some silly gore. The lead hero is the geeky, Columbus. A live at home loser whom has managed to survive since America has been run over by zombies. He meets fun loving zombie killer, Tallahassee, played by Woody Harrelson whom is still looking pretty good. The two join forces and meet 2 sisters that get the better of them. So, the rest of the movie is a road trip between the four as they travel west. Then the final part at Pacificland was rather silly because it just made the 2 girls look dumb.There is some fun gore of zombies ripping open necks or eating inwards, but it's not meant to be scary. Then there is the cameo by Bill Murray, that part was funny.FINAL VERDICT: Decent film, worth seeing if you like silly films.",6,0,0,29 July 2010
Enemy at the Gates," Not as good as Saving Private Ryan...
","but it is still a fairly good film.  The war scenes, especially the beginning, were well done and even scary.  The Russian soldiers were forced to run to their death.  It was basically suicide.  The acting was good, but I had a problem with Jude Law because he just looked to hot to be some starving soldier living in filth.  Even with dirt on his face, he still looked like he stepped off a GQ cover.  Ed Harris was my favorite character in this. I liked how his character was always calm and cool although he did something stupid at the end.
I had a problem with the newspaper and signs being written in Russian. They speak English throughout the film.  And Joseph Fiennes' character dictates his stories in English and spells in English, so why on earth was the newspaper shown written in Russian.  Also, you have to overlook the fact that the main characters have a British accent.
I also felt the love story thrown in weakened the main plot of the film. This movie was about 2 snipers in a cat and mouse game.  That is one reason SPR was better because it didn't have some sappy love story in the middle of the film.
FINAL VERDICT:  One of the better war movies, but it does have some flaws. Worth a viewing if you are into war movies or Jude Law.",Null,1,2,5 September 2002
A Beautiful Mind," great drama with a twist in the middle
","This is a really good movie.  Russell Crowe is great and definitely deserved the Oscar for this more than for Gladiator.  The acting is top notch.  And the story really lets an outsider see into the mind of someone with schizophrenia.  
(SPOILERS): I knew this was about schizophrenia, but I was shocked half way through the movie to find out the roomate and little girl were all in his mind. That was a great twist.  I knew all that Russian spy stuff was all made up ahead of time.  And the baby in the tub scene was really great and showed how this disease is not only sad, but can make the afflicted person dangerous.  But, I think in real life Nash's wife divorced him, so I think that should have been in the movie. (END OF SPOILERS)FINAL VERDICT: Great. The story flows along smoothly. It is not boring even though one may think it would me since it is about a mathmatician. A must see.",Null,0,2,20 January 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," the books are great but the movies are average
","I thought the second Potter movie would be much better because I liked the second book a lot more. The book was very funny. I laughed out loud reading the Gilderoy Lockhart parts. But, the movie never made me laugh out. They tried to put some of the funny moments in the book in the movie, but they just didn't seem  very funny in the movie.  The best part about the movie was Dobby. Dobby looked very real, and he was just like what was described in the book.  But, I guess the books just don't make great movies because there are so many great characters and side plots in the books that you can't put in a movie because of time restraints.  The movie is nearly 3 hours, but it just seems rather boring because they try to include as much from the book as they can, so it feels like a lot of scenes are cut short. Plus all the books take place over the course of the entire school year. And it is very hard to make a movie feel like that much time has passed.FINAL VERDICT: Young kids will love the movies. But, for adults, reading the books are much better.",Null,1,2,13 November 2003
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," do you know who you married?
","In this case no. Two super killers marry yet neither knows what they do. They each have cover jobs and are gone a lot. The movie begins with them in marriage therapy. They show how they met in Bogata. Hot! Each gets assigned to the same target. They try to kill each other not knowing the other's identity. The target gets away but they soon discover it was the other that tried to kill them. So the middle of the film is them trying to kill each other. There's an awesome gun and hand fight between the two as they wreck their home. But neither can kill each other. They make up and now got both their agencies after them since their cover is blown.The last 20 minutes with another gun fight was rather boring, not as good as the rest of the movie.And Jolie and Pitt are as hot as ever. Brad takes his shirt off several times and looks better then he did 5 years ago.FINAL VERDICT: One of the better big budget action films that has been released lately. The two stars are very hot and fun to watch. The plot is entertaining enough and there are several funny lines. So, I recommend it for simply a fun movie to watch.",7,0,2,8 June 2006

This movie has the same vibe as Scorsese's Goodfello's, but I don't think it is as good. Leo is the undercover cop trying to get the goods on mob boss Jack Nickolson. While Matt is one of Nickolson's boys who has landed a cop position. It is soon believed there is a rat in the police force and it's Matt's job to find the rat. What better way for him to tip of Nickelson about upcoming raids and keep the heat off him. Lots of police surveillance trying to find the mole as well as nutty behavior by Nickelson. The last 20 minutes has some shocking deaths and many head 'shots'.The revelation of the whole story was just very entertaining. It was well thought out. There is even major drama once Leo discovers who the mole was in the police.FINAL VERDICT: Very good story.",9,1,2,28 August 2007
Glory Road," entertaining story that's been told before
","This movie really wasn't anything new but it was still entertaining to watch. After reading that some of the racist scenes in the film were made up, it makes me think lesser of the film. I know the director added the hotel room scene and bathroom scene for dramatic effect, but if it didn't happen, it should not have been included. Also, the fact the movie makes it seem like Coach Haskins came in his first year and won the championship, which wasn't true.Josh Lucas did a good job and was fun to watch. Since he was the central character, you needed a good performance to make the movie watchable. He did a good enough job.FINAL VERDICT: If you love sports, definitely see it. But if you just like inspirational stories, then it is worth watching too.",7,0,1,25 November 2006
American Made," interesting story
","This is the first movie Tom Cruise has done in a long time that I acutally liked. He plays a real guy Barry Seal, whom was recruited by the CIA to smuggle guns to South America. Along the way he got mixed up the drug cartels and started smuggling drugs back the USA. Of course, he made a lot of unexplained money and eventually it was all going to catch back up to him. The movie teaches a good lesson to remember: don't screw over the cartel. Barry met the fate that he couldn't out run once he was outed for spying for the US government on the cartels.FINAL VERDICT: Good story, worth a watch.",6,1,2,13 June 2018
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," it was mind numbing
","First, I want to say I really liked the first Transformers. It was much better than I expected and had a decent plot and was funny. The last hour of this movie was awful and silly. There was so much going on screen, you had know idea what was even going on. It was just special effects with machines fighting and the humans were after thoughts, just shown running through smoke and explosions. Megan Fox has nothing to do and it's good she won't be wasting her time in the third film. The parts I can say were good were in the beginning with Sam's parents, both at the house and when they go to his college. The soldiers brought back were pointless and the FBI agent is back. He's a butcher with a web site about aliens. And somehow this old robot transports them to Egypt??? Made no sense.FINAL VERDICT: The last hour was just one long boring action scene involving the robots. And this movie at 2 and 1/2 hours is too long. It just isn't good enough to recommend.",4,1,7,1 June 2010
The Holiday," geared toward single females
","This movie aims for one audience, the single female. The two women in this have these two nearly perfect romances while on vacation. What every single 30 year old woman wishes.In this movie, Amanda travels to England for Christmas while Iris goes to LA to stay in her home. Iris likes one of Amanda's friends, whom breaks up with his girlfriend. That leaves room for Iris to move in.Amanda falls for Iris's brother, played by Jude Law. In the movie he is a widower with two kids and is supposed to be all sweet and perfect. I think he is miscast, just not believable because everyone knows that Law has not been Mr. Perfect in real life. He's cheated on his wife and later another girlfriend. I just can't take him seriously as someone who deserves pity or good things.The movie is cute in places, a few laughs. But it is just too idealic for two losers in love to find the perfect guy in 2 weeks.FINAL VERDICT: I guess if you are 30 year old woman, then you may want to check it out, but this is not for everyone.",6,0,2,20 October 2007
Zero Dark Thirty," more of a made for TV documentary....
","one would expect to see on the Discovery or History channel. I just didn't think this story made a great movie, it seemed more appropriate for cable TV. The film tells the story of a made up character, Maya, whom guesses right on intelligence as to the location of Osama Bin Ladan. Problem is we know how it ends; so the ending with the special arms forces leading a raid at night was not suspenseful. There was nothing to hold your attention since you already know what they found in the compound. Then you have the made up ending of Maya looking over the body and then getting to go home, just cheesy.And I don't see why Jessica Chastain got such recognition for the role. I didn't think her character was anything special and neither was her acting.FINAL VERDICT: Nothing special about this. Should have premiered on the history channel.",5,1,4,22 August 2013
Crazy Heart," country songs with great acting
","After seeing this, Jeff Bridges definitely deserved the Oscar he won for this role. He was great and so was Maggie Gyllenhaal. I don't think this was the best movie because it moved slowly along and there wasn't a lot of action, but the songs and acting were great. I'm always a fan of movies that have several original songs that are good, and this movie has that. The country songs in this are quite catchy and are performed several times in the movie.Bridges plays a typical alcoholic aging country star, Bad Blake. Bad is reduced to playing small bars and bowling allies. He spends the days drinking and shows up just in time to sing his set. At one of his stops, he meets Jean, a small town reporter whom wants an interview. She interviews him twice and the second time starts an affair with him. This was my only problem with the film because Maggie G. is just too young for Jeff B. for it to be believable. She's not a groupie and I didn't buy someone with a young son like her would start an affair with a traveling singer. But, after getting past that, she invites Bad over to meet her boy. Bad continues his tour but is hurt in a car wreck so calls on Jean to help him out. He spends more time with Jean and her son and the relationship grows.He leaves again, but they keep in touch and she comes to visit. There is an incident involving Bad and her son that changes everything including making Bad realize he needs to clean up his act.FINAL VERDICT: Great, a must see.",8,1,3,23 November 2010
War of the Worlds," excellent sci-fi film
",I never saw the original so I don't know how the stories differ but this version was really good. The special effects were amazing. It really seemed like all those people were fleeing the tri-pods and getting zapped. It looked like Cruise was literally running only feet from falling debris.Cruise plays a dad who is a real jerk to his young daughter and older son. They are visiting him for the weekend in the city when the lightening storms start. From there we see tri-pods coming out of the ground and causing havoc. It was awesome.They escape in the only working vehicle on the way to Boston where his ex wife is. They stay the first night at his ex's house and end up with an airplane outside the front door. So their trek continues and they meet up with more tri-pods and eventually his son goes off. So Cruise and his daughter take up in this crazy guy's basement for some tense scenes.And I won't say how it ends because you should be surprised. And I liked that finally there is a disaster movie that doesn't have the President and scientists and skipping all over the place. It focuses on one family.FINAL VERDICT: This is the story of how one dad goes from jerk to hero during an alien invasion. This is the must see film of the summer. The special effects were simply outstanding.,9,30,57,15 July 2005
Love Actually," I really liked this
","This movie was great. It would have been a good one to see at the theater. The film follows several characters and what happens to them in the weeks before Christmas. It follows their love lives and some of the characters have interactions with each other at the end at a school Christmas play. There are some humorous and touching scenes. I particularly liked the washed up singer, Billy Mack, as he promoted his Christmas song all throughout the film. How could you not laugh when you see the music video and what he does when the song reaches number one. And my next favorite character was Hugh Grant as the prime minister who has the hots for one of his assistants. Then there are some more serious relationships between a husband and wife and two co-workers, who try to hook up but the girls crazy brother keeps interrupting them. Then the very sweet relationship involving Colin Firth as he falls for his non-English speaking helper. The other really funny guy was Colin Frissell who goes to Wisconsin to find some hot American girls. It's like Wisconsin, but he goes to a bar there and finds some LA looking women. Very funny.FINAL VERDICT: I highly recommend it. It has a lot of great stories and is funny. And all the stories make sense in the end.",Null,0,3,30 November 2004
12 Years a Slave," sure it's a good movie...
","but I didn't think it was best picture material. A lot of movies have been made bout slavery and people acted like this was the first one. Of course, a movie about the subject is going to be good, but it's not an unique concept. And the girl that one the academy award wasn't on screen much and didn't do much. She had one big seen about her soap and that wins awards. I though the main guy, Solomon was really good and if any one should have won awards for acting it should have been him. And why did Brad Pitt have to cast himself as the one white guy against slavery, he just wanted to make himself look good.FINAL VERDICT: Not a must see, a good movie if you want to see something about a serious subject.",7,0,1,12 September 2014
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," teens dating and breaking up...
","is what this movie is about. Nick goes to play with his band and spots his ex, Tris, there with a guy. Norah knows Tris and in order to not seem like a loser picks a guy at random and kisses him saying it's her boyfriend. Well, she picks Nick whom still seems stuck on Tris. Norah loves the CD mixes that Nick has made for Tris, so he gives her a ride. But, Norah's friend, drunk Caroline, goes missing, so they are tracking her down throughout much of the film. Tris starts wanting Nick back because she is jealous. And also, Norah must contend with her ex. All the while the two are also trying to find out the mystery place their favorite band, Where's Fluffy, is playing.Two problems I had with the movie were first Caroline because the actress looks like she's 30 to me and she is supposed to be a high school senior. Second, they make Norah out to look cheap at the end because she's a teen and just met a guy and lets him do 'some things.' I don't think that needed to be in a teen film.FINAL VERDICT: It was OK. I liked the lead actors and they made it more interesting since there really wasn't a whole lot to the plot.",6,0,0,16 August 2009
30 Days of Night," lots of gore and plot holes
","This movie was a little more graphic than I expected and that's a good thing. However, I had lots of questions throughout. Never mind the fact that in Alaska when the northern most parts have total darkness in winter, it is a gradual thing. They don't have 8 hours of sunlight one day and complete darkness the next, which is how this movie seems to depict it. The concept is a good one. A group of foreign vampires, perhaps Russian since they arrive by boat, send a human to the town of Barrow to destroy all phones and lines of communication as well as sabotage the only helicopter and others forms of transportation, such as sled dogs. The whole dog thing was so brutal and I did not want to see that.Then when the town's 30 days of darkness begins, the vamps begin attacking local citizens to feed. There are lots of closeups of blood squirting out of sliced throats, etc... Next problem I have is that Josh Harnett isn't exactly what you would think a sheriff of some isolated Alaskan town would look like. And once darkness comes and the power is cut, how come there seems to be so much light when the towns people are running around outside. When it's snowing, there would be no light from the stars or moon, so why did it look they had tons of light set up outside.Next issue, the vamps go from house to house tearing it apart looking for survivors. Why do they never do this to any of the buildings the survivors are hiding in. Why do they allow these humans to live for days on end instead of finding them hiding in houses. Also, when the survives stupidly go running around the town, why are they never spotted by the vamp lookouts on the roofs. Also, what was the point of running to the grandma's house for the UV lights. The sheriff proves it does hurt the vamps, but he only uses it on one before they cut the power. Was that worth risking his life for?As for the ending, I liked it. I never expected the sheriff to come up with that solution to save the day so to speak.FINAL VERDICT: If you like a good horror movie with lots of blood and gore, then watch this.",6,3,7,29 September 2008
Wedding Crashers," funny, but unbelievable love story
","This movie had more of a plot than I thought it would have. I was expecting a lot of raunchy humor like American Pie, but the jokes just weren't gross out ones. Two 30 year old guys get their kicks by crashing weddings during the summer. They do it for the food, boos, fun , and women. In the beginning, we see Jeremy and John attend a few weddings and see the tricks they pull to pick up women. Jeremy makes animal balloons and tells sob stories. Tehy try to cut the wedding cake and look like they belong before chatting up chicks.Then they crash the wedding of a congressman's daughter. Jeremy nails one of the brides maids, another daughter, Gloria. She's all clingy and it freaks him out. John likes another daughter, Claire, but she has a boyfriend. Gloria invites Jeremy and John to the family retreat. Jeremy doesn't want to go because he's ready to ditch Gloria, but John insists they must go so he can get Claire. All throughout the film they recite the 'rules' and John points out Rule # says never leave a fellow crasher behind.The middle of the movie is at the retreat. A lot of laughs come from Claire's very competitive boyfriend and the family outcast, Todd. But the truth comes out about Jeremy and John lying. But things end up good for both guys in the end.But what really makes this movie unbelievable is that John, who loves one night stands, would fall in love with Claire in a day and want to stop being a hound dog. I don't think so. But just get by that part and the movie is good.Plus, Will Ferrell has a funny cameo as a legendary crasher.FIANL VERDICT: Funny, entertaining.",7,1,2,20 July 2006
There Will Be Blood," very long, story could have been tightened up
","Sure Daniel Day Lewis was good in this, but his role in Gangs of New York was a lot better and he didn't win the Oscar for that. His character, Daniel Plainview, doesn't really do anything to stand out to me. And I thought his character was going to be a lot meaner than what he was.Daniel Plainview is an oilman. He buys up land in Texas to drill and teaches his young son how to run the family business. He becomes successful but often cheats families when buying land. He doesn't give them the real value of the land. His son is injured in an accident and loses his hearing. Before too long, Daniel ships him off to school in California. He also must deal with a preacher, Sunday, that he considers a fake. He has to say he is a sinner in church in order to buy this one man's land. You could tell he really resented the preacher for this humiliation. He gets him back in the very end.While his son is away, a man turns up claiming to be his brother. With his son gone, Daniel starts to let this guy get involved with the business. But the guy slips up and Daniel knows he's an impostor and shows him what happens when you cross Daniel Plainview.Toward the end of the movie, it skips forward in time by many years. Daniel is now an old, lonely drunk. He lives in a huge mansion and his son comes by. The son says he wants to move to Mexico to get a drilling business going there. Daniel calls him a competitor and disowns him. He is very mean to his son and reveals a shocking secret about his childhood.Overall, this is a dark film about a man making a living drilling for oil in the early 1900s.FINAL VERDICT: Worth watching. I just don't think it's Daniel Day Lewis's best nor one of the top films of the year.",7,2,4,28 February 2009
Ice Age," An OK story
","Ice Age was OK, but the story wasn't as good as Monster's Inc.  Plus, it wasn't as funny and the animation wasn't as good.  Ice Age wasn't as original as Monster's Inc or Toy Story.  It's about a mammoth, a sloth, and a sabertooth tiger, who all come together to take a baby back to its dad. Predictably, the bad guy, Diego the tiger, becomes friends with his companions and helps them escape the tiger ambush.  The best character was Sid the Sloth. He had the most entertaining lines.FINAL VERDICT:  Kids will like it. But adults may be board because the story is predictable.  If you want to see a cool animated film, stick with Monster's Inc or Shrek because they are better.",Null,1,2,18 June 2003
Burlesque," terrible story
","The plot to this movie was awful. It was so clich√© and predictable and boring. This is by far the worst musical that has been made lately. The only positive thing I can say is there were a couple of good songs in it. First, Christina Aguilera is not an actor. She even looks weird without her silly bleached blonde hair. Jack her love interest can't act. Stanley Tucci was the only decent actor. I like Cher, but her role as the older successful dancer trying to 'mother' the up and comer while saving her club was dull.I can't believe the writers of this movie ever got it made. They must have known someone who knew someone who knew someone. It's that bad of a script.FINAL VERDICT: Don't waste your time.",2,5,9,3 July 2011
Man on Fire," The last hour was good and had some suspense...
","the problem was not much happens in the first hour. This is definitely a movie that is too long and needed to be edited to 105 minutes. The first hour basically shows Creasy who at first is cold toward Pita learn to care for her and be her friend. He takes over a parenting role when her parents are absent. This should have only taken 30 minutes to show. Finally, we get some action when Pita is kidnapped. Although, I still don't buy the fact that Creasy still lives after being shot in the chest a couple of times.After recovering, Creasy is on a mission to kill all who was involved in Pita's kidnapping and death. He uses a license tag number to begin the hunt and gets help from a reporter who also wants to expose the corruptness of the police. He tracks down those who were involved and torchers and kills them. Some of the torcher scenes, while not shown, still make you cringe because it looks like it would really hurt.Then the twist, which I guessed before hand, is that Pita's father arranged the kidnapping in order to steal some of the ransom money. Creasy figures this out and the father does what he must since he thinks he killed his daughter. After tracking down the family of the Voice (the mastermind behind the kidnappings), Creasy learns that Pita is still alive and the Voice is willing to trade Pita for his brother and Creasy's life. And to make it seem not so sad and it was so Hollywood, Creasy is shot before hand and appears to be dying from blood loss. So, when he turns himself over to the kidnappers after they let Pita go, it makes it seem not so sad since the 'hero' was going to die any way. I wonder if that is what really happened in real life.FINAL VERDICT: Once the action started, it got interesting. Dezel was good as usual, so if you like him or if a movie about kidnapping interests you, then I recommend it.",7,0,2,8 March 2005
Edge of Tomorrow," Groundhog Day meets Aliens
","I usually think sci-fi movies have too many plot holes, and this one has some, but for the most part it makes sense. Of course, they are using the plot of groundhog day set in an alien invasion. One big plot hole is why didn't Rita leave herself notes so she wouldn't have to repeatedly meet Cage over and over. And the whole part where she and the scientist dude figured out some aliens are Alpha protecting an entity called Omega, was very far fetching. But anyway it was cool to see how Cage improved day to day to get further on the battlefield. Considering we are talking about invading aliens, why did others, like the general, find it so hard to believe Cage and Rita about time travel.Anyway, it ended how it should with Cage waking up again except this time, things are different.FINAL VERDICT: Pretty good sci-fi with cool special effects. Definitely one of Cruise's better films in the past 10 years.",7,2,4,9 February 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," entertaining tale of guy...
","getting away with illegal activities till one day he isn't so lucky any more. This type of movie has been done before, where you have a guy, a novice, beginning something new, getting good at it and taking short cuts and bending the laws, until one day, the authorities have enough evidence to put him behind bars.Jordan is a newbie at brokering and loves making the big bucks. The stock market crashes and he is out of a job. He finds a job selling penny stocks and is soon rolling in the cash by getting people to invest in stocks that aren't going to make them money, but will make him money.

He's so good at it he makes millions both legal and illegal ways.Of course, when the government finds out your into fraud, they will catch you. But till then, Jordan is just into everything. There are some comedic moments like when Jordan can't talk and walk while on qualudes and when they are on the boat in the storm.FINAL VERDICT: I wonder how much of the story is really true. It's based on a book written by the real Jordan. And ways, it is a little long at almost 3 hours, but it's entertaining enough to sit through. Check it out.",7,0,2,25 September 2014
Army of Darkness," very silly
","This was OK, and there were parts that made me laugh, but I still like Evil Dead 1 and 2 better.  This movie just had too many silly scenes that didn't make a whole lot of sense.  And there was no gore and blood like the first 2 movies.  The director should have stuck with the same formula by making a horror comedy like Evil Dead 2.  Instead, this was just a comedy, and the bad guys were really fake looking skeletons that fall over when anything touches them.
FINAL VERDICT:  If you just want to see a comedy, then you will enjoy this. But, if you are looking for something like Evil Dead 2, you won't find it here. Instead watch Dead Alive.",Null,1,2,2 January 2003
The Last King of Scotland," great Oscar performance
","Forest Whitaker was very good in this and deserved the awards he won. He looked like the real Amin and I bought him as a brutal dictator. From reading other reviews, the doctor role was fiction and used to tell Amin's dictatorship though rose colored glasses. The doctor sees Amin with his kids at his nice house throwing pool parties. He pretends like he really doesn't know what is going on after hearing reports of people turning up missing in the country. And one of those guys is missing after Nickolas tells Amin he saw him conducting a suspicious meeting at a hotel. Nickolas wasn't exactly someone you root for since he goes after 2 married women and turns a blind eye to some of Amin's business.The story was entertaining and it didn't even have to show a lot of killings and mass graves that went on during Amin's tenure. There were a couple of scenes for shock value toward the end. One involving arms where legs should be and meat hooks. I had to turn away for that.FINAL VERDICT: Entertaining, interesting, check it out.",8,0,2,12 November 2007
It Chapter Two," some good gore but 60 minutes too long
","This movie was an hour too long and too many scenes from the past spliced in between the current events. First part of the movie is the friends coming together again and they've forgotten what happened in the first film except for Mike whom stayed in Derry. As the movie goes on, they keep seeing visions curtsy of Pennywise, not a lot makes sense. Then there is some good gore scenes of Pennywise biting people's heads and hearts. But the part about the town wondering what's happened to missing people isn't even touched upon. Then the last 45 minutes is the crew battling a spider like clown and back in that creepy house and it is just dull and not clever.FINAL VERDICT: Skip this",3,1,2,20 April 2020
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," no plot, but some funny scenes
","The one big complaint about Anchorman is it had no plot. It was about this big shot tv newsman, Ron Burgandy, and how he has to deal with the introduction of a female reporter, Veronica, who also wants to be a news anchor.  So, we get a lot of sexist jokes since it takes place in the 70s. The movie felt like a bunch of short skits thrown together. Ron dates Veronica and announces it to the office. Very funny. He also with a coworker makes prank phone calls to her. He has his news buddies, which form a funny and unusual group. One guy says things that are off the wall and have nothing to do with the conversation.  It had some funny cameos, Luke Wilson and Ben Stiller.  There was one disturbing scene in which the audience actually gasped and that was when Jack Black kicks a dog over a bridge. That was terrible. But, the dog lived and came back to negotiate with a bear. Don't even ask if you haven't seen the film.It had one very funny and uncomfortable scene when Ron is talking to Veronica and gets 'very excited' at the office.  Ron and his buddies sing Afternoon Delight; it was just funny how they did it.  I along with the people I was with laughed a lot.  And throughout the film, they let us know Ron will read whatever is on the telepromtor, so you know that will lead to a good joke. Veronica writes something which gives this pg-13 film it's one 'f' word. And it was very funny.  There are many other scenes which made me laugh, I just wish more thought had been put into coming up with a delima for the characters to overcome.FINAL VERDICT: I found it to be funny, so I recommend it. But, it certainly is not a great movie because there is no plot. If you like Will Ferrell, definitely see it.",Null,1,2,26 July 2004
American Gangster," Nice to see a different kind of gangster film....
","One in which it isn't about the Italian or Russian mob. The gangsters here are American born and run Harlem. Headman Bumpy Johnson dies and his driver, Frank Lucas, decides its his time to take over the business. Frank's getting squeezed by local players and decides he must do something to get more of the dope market and to be the top dog. There are reports that soldiers in Vietnam are becoming addicted to heroin because of its cheap price and easy access. Frank goes over there and uses some connections and makes a deal to ship pure heroin using Army planes back to the US for distribution. Before long he has control over the dope market in New York and is top dog. He even shoots someone on the sidewalk in front of many people to prove he's not afraid and to put fear in the commoner.Russell Crowe plays the cop whom is assigned to form a drug force to take down big players in New York. His investigation leads to once unknown Frank as being the big supplier.So, the latter part of the film is the police investigation into Frank and how the dirty cops play into it all. The film also shows us some of Frank's personal life with his mom and wife. And it's all very entertaining. The film is long at over 2 and a half hours, but it seemed to fly by. That's the mark of a good film.FINAL VERDICT: I'm a big fan of Russell Crowe and he doesn't disappoint here. He's good in this as well as Denzel. The film is one of the best of the year.",9,4,6,25 September 2008
Stranger Than Fiction," something different from Will Ferrell
","This is not another Will Ferrell comedy. He actually tries his hand at drama here. It is different type of film for Ferrell; however, we have seen films like this before. Such as Jim Carey in the Truman Show. Ferrell plays Harold Crick, an IRS agent who wakes up one day and hears a voice describing his life. He thinks he's crazy as well as others. He visits a doctor but doesn't want to take medication. So, he goes to see an English professor. He describes what the voice says and how poetic he sounds. One day at the teachers office, he sees an interview on the TV of an author who sounds exactly like the voice in his head. He tracks her down and discovers she is writing a book and he is the central character. She writes tragedies, but he asks her not to kill him off. There is a side plot of him falling for a baker whom he audits. Not really a whole lot there. Plus Maggie Gynallhal is way to young to play his love interest.Overall, it was sort of interesting but nothing great. It is not something you care to see twice. And you won't be missing anything by not seeing it.FINAL VERDICT: It was OK. It is what it is. Sort of bland sort of interesting, but nothing that stands out.",6,0,2,27 September 2007
The Reader," OK story but with...
","a bunch of unnecessary nudity thrown in for publicity. I think Kate Winslett's nude scenes were to help advertise the Reader. Her young lover, Michael, also shows off too. But aside from that, this movie is OK but nothing great. Winslett is Hana Schmitz, an older woman that falls for a 15 year old and begins an affair. She has him read her lots of books since she is hiding her illiteracy. The first part of the film is about the affair; the second part is about Hana's trial. She is on trial with others for being a nazi guard and letting her prisoners burn in a church. An older Michael is now in law school and is attending her trial. He wants to say something when Hana's illiteracy could help her case, but doesn't. Hana gets a life sentence.The make up and aging of Hana is very good. But the film does have a slow pace and is too long at close to 2 hours. Winslett deserved all the acting nominations and awards. The subject matter just doesn't make this my type of movie.FINAL VERDICT: Drama lovers will probably like this and think it's great. I thought it was just OK.",6,0,2,23 February 2010
The Wrestler," the story was not as compelling...
","as I thought it would be. The acting was very good, but there wasn't a lot to the story. I wouldn't call the Wrestler one of the top films of the year.Mickey Rourke plays Randy 'the Ram', a has been wrestler that has wasted the money he made and now lives in a trailer, works at a grocery store, and still wrestlers in matches on the small stage. This guy has fallen far. He once had a video game named after him, which he plays, and wrestled in Madison Square Garden. He has a heart attack after a match and the doctors recommend he quit wrestling and the roids.He uses this as a way to try to change his life. He tries to get to know a stripper, Cassidy, that he likes. He meets with her outside of work. He also tries to make up with his estranged daughter. But as someone whom hurts people, he never learns his lesson.I didn't like the ending because it seemed there wasn't one. I guess we were to assume that was either the end for the Ram or he had more heart problems and didn't live much longer.FINAL VERDICT: Story was slow and not much happens. But the acting is excellent, so it's worth watching.",6,1,2,4 December 2009
Dark Shadows," campy vampire tale....
","was Barnabas good or bad? That is what I was trying to figure out after watching this. On one hand, he is supposed to be the protagonist who is going up against evil and on the other hand he is killing construction workers and spaced out campers.Barnabas is a vampire that is released after being underground for 200 years. So there is a lot of campy jokes about how things have changed, from roads to cars to parties. He finds that some relatives are now living in his house and he conveniently has a room filled with hidden treasure, so that takes care of money issues. The witch that buried him is still running the town and she is still obsessed about him. Also, Barnabas's love has been resurrected in Victoria, a girl living with the family. So the film is about Barnabas trying to get rid of the with, Angie. And as it turns out half the family have some sort of supernatural powers.FINAL VERDICT: Seemed like this was thrown together to take advantage of the popularity of vampires. It's not a comedy, but it's not to be taken serious. Don't go out of your way to see it.",5,1,1,8 April 2013
Hancock," I didn't think it would be very good and it wasn't
","I thought this movie was supposed to have some comedy in it; however, it didn't make me laugh. It was hard to sit all the way through it because it wasn't very interesting. Will Smith, plays superhero Hancock, but unlike other superheroes, he is rude, crude, and creates a mess whenever he tries to help. He's caused millions of dollars worth of damage and has been sued by those he helps.One day he saves Ray and Ray has the idea to change Hancock's image so the public will like him. First, he tells him to go to jail so the public will miss him, then wear a superhero costume, and say good job to the police. Throughout, Ray's wife, Mary, keeps giving Hancock weird looks, so we know something is up. She knows him from the past and the movie just tells up why, no mystery to it.The ending just left a lot to be desired. I didn't find it very entertaining. Plus, I don't get why they made the special effects so fake. Hancock flying and throwing the whale looked too fake for today's special effects.FINAL VERDICT: Teens will probably like this but I'd say most adults wouldn't. Also, the language used is too vulgar for real young kids, say under 12. The word a ##hole is used too much.",4,2,4,1 July 2009
Kong: Skull Island," cool monster movie
","I thought this move was pretty good, mainly because of the great special effects. Kong looks great, he looks real, the skull crawlers were good and the giant buffalo. The story was pretty basic. Investors hire army guys to go to a hidden island for research but in reality it is to prove the existence of monsters. They anger Kong, so he kills some of the men and commander wants revenge. Some of the others realize Kong is of importance to the island after meeting a long lost WWII soldier. So you have the final battle between evil commander, good guys and Kong and of course the evilest beast on the island thrown in.FINAL VERDICT: Lots of cool special effects. It's eye candy, so IMO worth watching.",7,5,7,1 December 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," one big long fight
","The main problem with this movie is that it seemed like one big, long fight. There wasn't much of a plot, just a lot of computer effects that start to get boring and 'armies' going at one another. The Ring hardly has a presence in this film; it should have been used more. The dragon dies in the first 10 minutes and then for some unknown reason, Thorin gets all the gold and the townspeople get none. How come? Thorin didn't rescue the city. And what did the elf King have to do with anything. He helps rescue Gandolph then disappears. There was just too many things like that.FINAL VERDICT: Perhaps the worst of the franchise. Just don't try to watch it if you are sleepy because you won't make it though till the end.",6,2,3,25 August 2015
Hitch," I'm not a huge fan of the date comedy, but this one works
","This movie was much better than I expected. After a couple of films by Will Smith that weren't that great like I, Robot, he is back to being likable and fun in this one. Smith plays, Hitch, a date doctor. Most of the film centers around him teaching Albert how to be himself and get a date with Allegra Cole, a rich famous celebrity whom he works with. Albert is a klutz and goof and always tripping on his feet or what-not. All Hitch does is teach him how to act more cool and not be so nervous around Allegra.During all this, Hitch meets Sara, a gossip columnist whom has sworn off men. Hitch charms her, so of course, they go out. But, Hitch may teach other guys how to get the girl to fall for them, he doesn't believe in love himself. He has never really had a girl since he was dumped in college. But, he likes Sara, so keeps going after her. Sara's friend is hurt by guy whom she thinks went to the date doctor. So Sara tracks the doctor down, only to learn its Hitch. So of course, she thinks he's a pig. Then it's up to hitch to explain to Sara and Allegra what he does, so they both end up forgiving.FINAL VERDICT: Good, has some laughs, and is entertaining. I recommend it.",7,0,0,24 December 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," I finally liked this Star Wars movie...
","unlike Episodes 1 and 2 that sucked. My big complaint with Episodes 1 and 2 was the cheesy, simplistic dialog. While this movie had a few of those scenes, especially in the beginning, the dialog got better. It didn't sound as if written by an 8 year old. I'll skip the plot since about everyone already knows it. I think the rise of the 'dark side' and how Aniken became Darth Vader was very cool since you know how it all turns out once he meets his son again. I cringed when we find out how Aniken gets all his scars and loses his limbs. That part was gruesome for a pg-13 film. And all the fights with light sabers were well done. Obi-Wan was really good in that fight at the end. The movie even made you feel bad for the jedi when they are being assassinated.FINAL VERDICT: Entertaining story. Really brings together what comes next in Episodes 4-6. I'm definitely going to watch this again. So, I recommend seeing it even if you didn't think Episodes 1 or 2 were that great. If I knew it was this good, I'd seen it in the theater.",9,1,4,4 June 2006
Ray," Jamie Foxx did deserve the Oscar
","Before I saw Ray, I assumed it would not hold up to the hype and that Jamie Foxx really wouldn't be all that great. But, Foxx is great and did deserve to win all the acting awards. It didn't even seem like you were watching Jamie Foxx. The movements, the speech, the mannerisms were all like Ray Charles. I didn't know much about Ray Charles before seeing this. But, this biography was interesting and had great, entertaining music. It was over 2 and half hours, but I didn't find it to boring, but it could have been a little shorter.What I did learn is that as a person, Ray Charles was no choir boy. He was actually sort of scummy. He cheated on his wife all the time and shot up drugs for years.I did like how it showed him when he was younger and going blind. His mom did not baby him, instead she made him learn to do things for himself. It was hard for her to stand back and watch, but it needed to be done because in the real world, no one was going to watch over him.FINAL VERDICT: I recommend it. Jamie Foxx was great to watch.",8,1,2,23 August 2005
Shooter," lots of action with high body count...
","that after a while just gets to be too much. I thought this movie was pretty good, but the last 20 minutes go down hill. We are introduced to Bob Lee Swagger, the best sniper in the us military. He's who they call for all the secret missions that no one knows about. His partner dies and he quits the military. Several years later Colonel Johnson says the country needs his help. They've learned an attempt will be made on the President's life by a sniper and they want Swagger to show them where the sniper might shoot from, etc... Only problem, the President isn't the real target and the Colonel is out to set Swagger up as the shooter. Young FBI agent Memphis becomes involved because Swagger tells him it's a set up. Middle part of the movie is Swagger on the run, trying to recover from 2 bullet wounds. Once well he goes after Colonel and his associates. All the bodies do get kind of silly because the bad guys seem never to hit Swagger. Once Swagger turns himself in, that is when I thought the movie went down hill. The explanation of the rifle not being able to fire, what kind of FBI agents didn't investigate that. And then the final act of revenge was surprising.FINAL VERDICT: If you like all the violent action films, then this is for you.",6,1,3,13 August 2008
Inception," very complicated plot that actually made sense
","I usually don't care for sci-fi films like this because I always think it doesn't make a lot of sense and has too many plot holes. But, if you pay attention, the movie makes sense and you can follow it. It's about a guy, Dom, whom is an extractor, meaning, he steels secrets from people when they are dreaming. There are all these different roles involved to pull off a perfect dream. He's hired to implant a thought into a guy's head and if he succeeds will be able to go back home and be with his children.So, the plan is complicated, it actually involves 4 dreams within a dream. And there are all these rules when dreaming. Like what wakes you up and what sends your mind into limbo.FINAL VERDICT: Just pay attention, and you'll like it.",8,0,8,21 June 2011
Sherlock Holmes," really outlandish solutions to mysteries...
","sums up this movie. Holmes really comes up with some unbelievable answers, but if you can get over that, this movie was OK. The part that didn't work was all the kick @ss fighting Holmes and Watson do because I don't think that was really in the books.Downey was good as usual and Law was passable since he wasn't playing his usual character. Rachel Mcadams should have turned this role down because her character has very little to do and she was pretty much pointless through out the film. Considering you know Holmes is famous for figuring out impossible mysteries, it's safe to assume Lord Blackwood really isn't using supernatural powers. You just have to wait till the end for Holmes to give his ridiculous rant to how he did it all and fooled everyone.FINAL VERDICT: It was better than I expected, mainly because Robert Downey, Jr is so good. It's worth a viewing.",6,0,0,14 September 2010
The Good Shepherd," a good idea, but told in a boring manner
","I didn't think this movie was that good. It was rather boring, way too long. Not to mention the main characters don't do a whole lot. Sure, Edward Wilson helps start up the CIA, but this is far from a spy thriller. Jolie isn't given much to do except be a forgotten housewife. There were too many characters, and I got lost as to who was who. Also, with all the time jumping, it just added to the confusion of the film. Who was spying on who? Who were all the guys with Russian accents Edward kept meeting with in DC. I'm still not sure.Edward is faced with defending his countries secrets or giving up his own son. He chooses what a true patriot would do; however, helps protect his son also.FINAL VERDICT: Boring, the nearly 3 hour running time really drags this movie down.",5,1,3,25 December 2007
The Terminal," sort of interesting...
","but even Tom Hanks can't make a film great if the story isn't there. Hanks plays, Victor, an eastern Europeaner who has come to America only to find out his country doesn't exist politically any more. So, he can't get a visa and is stuck in the airport. The top airport security guy thinks it will just be a few days to straighten it out, but Victor ends up staying months. Along the way he meets a nice flight attendent, played by CZJ, but she really isn't given much to do. Plus, she's not that likable since she's having an affair with a married man. He also befriends other employees of the airport. He helps them, and they give him food and help set up dates with CZJ. The head guy sets up schemes to get Victor to leave the airport, but he won't. He can't even get Victor to admit he's fearful-one of the funny scenes. He even gets a job and makes a shrine to CZJ. It ends with him finally getting to do what he came to New York to do. His reason makes you think the money spent on air fare could have been better used since he only planned to stay a day any way. There's also a corny wedding between two airport employees Victor helps set up.FINAL VERDICT: Slow going, not much action. Another disappointment from Spielberg. I don't recommend it unless you have to see everything Hanks is in.",4,0,2,6 April 2005
The Blind Side," the sports feel good movie of the year
","This was one of the better movies of the year and Sandra Bullock's best role to date. I can see why she was nominated for acting awards, but I think she won because she didn't have much competition. The movie is about family and has some humor thrown in. SJ was the cutest kid and added some humor. The story is based on a real person, Michael Oher, whom was helped out by a rich white family when he didn't have anyone. They helped him get a college scholarship and he just happened to turn out to be a really good football player. He also became part of their family.FINAL VERDICT: Watch it. It's a good movie and has a happy ending.",9,0,2,7 October 2010
Music and Lyrics," cute songs...bad chemistry
","This movie was mildly amusing. I like the way Hugh Grant delivers his dry satirical lines. But he and Drew Barrymore do not belong together on screen. They had no chemistry. First, he is much older than her and British. They just don't make a cute couple, which is number one priority of a romantic comedy.Grant, playing 80s pop star, Alex Fider, makes the most of his character. It is funny when he sings these simple pop songs in his tight pants and all the middle age women go wild.I also liked Cora Corman, whom is a Britany Spears type of pop star, whom portrays her shows around Buddism and sticky and steamy dancing. Some of the lyrics to her songs were funny, ie toward the end when we here some of Slam and Entering Bootytown. And Cora's first performance of the song Alex and Sophie wrote for her was pretty outrageous.FINAL VERDICT: Liked the music but the casting was off. So, I say watch it if you like movies involving lots of music and singing; otherwise skip it.",5,0,3,5 January 2008
The Conjuring," nothing original
","There have been several movies in the past few years that was just like this movie, about possession, devil worshipers, demons, etc.... And The Conjuring really offers nothing new.A family movies into a cheap, creepy house, with a spooky basement. Weird things happen, doors open, sleep walking, mysterious clapping, etc... The wife goes to a ghost hunting couple and they investigate and learn the history behind the house. A woman that killed her kids lived there and other deaths have occurred on the land. The demon wants the wife's body to carry on her evil ways and ghost hunters must perform an exorcism. See, sounds like something you've seen many times before.FINAL VERDICT: If you like horror films, worth checking out but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it.",5,0,1,7 April 2014
Prometheus," did one know scientists could...
","be so dumb. Well, they are in this movie, that was marketed as the prequel to Aliens, which is still one of my all time favorites. It seems some scientists see ancient drawings on cave walls and concluded the drawings were referring to the creators of humans. So with it being almost the year 3000, technology has advanced and a group is sent into deep space in search of the planet in the drawings. They reach the planet and go exploring. And this is when the scientists get dumb. First, they decide to take their space helmets off in a creepy cave. Mess with a dead alien body and steel the head and not pay attention to the moving black stuff. Plus 2 of the geniuses get lost and don't make it back. Instead one of them decides it would be a good idea to stick his hand in front of a snake like alien creature. Bad idea.So things keep getting weirder on the planet, but the lead female, Shaw, is still OK with going back out. They find an alien still living and is anyone surprised when he isn't too happy about it.And it's set up for the sequel and I did like the very last scene when it gives a clue to how Aliens began. What I didn't get was the very beginning when the albino guy falls down that waterfall, what was that about? FINAL VERDICT: A descent sci-fi film. It did make sense, and had its tense moments.",6,1,1,7 April 2013
Wonder Woman," one of he better superhero movies
","I liked this movie a lot. Where I think the most improvement could have been made is in the script. I wished it had a few more funny lines, like the way the very first Spiderman had. I liked how the beginning showed the childhood of Diana and how she became a warrior and the land she came from. I liked the idea of how she entered the human world and the reasons why. It made sense. The action scenes were done well, I especially liked the ending scenes with Aries and how Diana defeated him.FINAL VERDICT: Much better than most of the other superhero movies out there. At least this had a good plot and just wasn't plain silly. Definitely recommend.",9,2,5,9 March 2018
Despicable Me," very enjoyable animated movie
","This is one of those animated movies that adults along with kids will enjoy. It is cute and funny and has a decent plot. The opening is great with how we learn the pyramid had been stolen: a brilliant idea. Then we meet super villain, Gru, whom needs to come up with an idea to top the pyramid napping. He is planning to steal the moon and hold it for ransom. To do this, he needs a shrink ray, which nerdy villain, Vector, has stolen from him. Gru adopts 3 cute girls in order to use them as a distraction to get the shrink ray back. But of course, being around the girls begins to change Gru and he begins to enjoy their company and being a dad. So, there are many cute scenes with the girls, like the fun park, the bedtime story, playing with the minions. Eventually, Gru must choose the girls or the moon and have a final battle with Vector, before realizing what's most important in the end.FINAL VERDICT: Very funny, and entertaining. Worth a movie rental.",7,0,0,3 July 2011
The Queen," Dreadfully boring
","This was a worthless piece of movie making. Who cares about what happened with the queen and the royal family the week Diana died. Sure Helen Mirren looked the part of the Queen and I guess did a good job. I don't really know since you never here the Queen talk in public, at least in America you don't. No one knows what was said behind closed doors, so this can't be an actually detailed movie of all the facts. The queen is basically portrayed as being indifferent when Diana died and wanting it to be a private affair not public. She was portrayed as cold by the media and forced to support a public funeral to appease the Princess's fans. Her husband even says things like 'you hated Diana' toward the queen. That's probably true.But the point is this movie is just dull and certainly did not deserve to be nominated for best picture. I'm glad I didn't pay to see it.FINAL VERDICT: Not good. Sure the acting is descent, but the movie is pointless. Who cares how the royal family handled Diana's death.",3,7,20,6 September 2007
1408," psychological horror
","This movie is not scary, I call it more of a psychological thriller movie. Mike Enslin writes books about top 10 haunted places to visit. He gets a postcard stating do not stay in room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel. He decides the hotel would make a good chapter in his book, so elects to stay there. He has to get his publisher to threaten to sue the hotel in order to stay in the room. After arriving, he gets an earful from the hotel manager, Mr. Olin, as to why he should not stay in room 1408. There have been over 50 deaths, from suicides to natural causes, even a drowning.Enslin can't be persuaded otherwise, and goes into the room. At first, there is nothing unusual about the room. He gets a maintenance worker to come up to fix the thermostat. The guy won't come in the room but talks him though it. So, the room cools down, and that is when strange occurrences occur. The radio comes on, chocolates appear on the bed, the window crashes down on his hand. He gets spooked and wants to leave, but the door handle falls off and it won't open.He starts seeing things, previous inhabitants of the room, but mostly other people from his life, such as his dad and later his daughter. It's like the room shows you all the bad things in your life and you can't escape. Soon, there is even a wall where the window is.Does Enslin come up with a plan to escape the room? Watch to find out.FINAL VERDICT: It's OK, but doesn't have that one scene that really makes you say wow. It's not one I would pay to watch.",5,0,0,4 January 2009
Taken 2," the fact that this happens twice to the same guy.....
","just too ridiculous and the ending is just unbelievable. This movie was OK but not as good as the first one because it's just too out there to believe that this happened to the same guy twice. Any ways, kick #ss special forces dude, Bryan Mills, is off to Turkey for work and invites his ex wife and daughter along. They decide to go even though it has been just a short time since the daughter, Kim, was kidnapped and almost sold as a sex slave. Well, the relatives of the men that Bryan killed from the first film are back and want to make Bryan pay.So we get a kidnapping and super cool way of Bryan figuring out where he is and getting daughter Kim to rescue him. That was super agent stuff. What's really unbelievable is once they get to the US embassy, Bryan doesn't use their help, he just goes out again on his own. I just don't buy that.FINAL VERDICT: If you want to see an older guy beat the you know what out of the bad guys, then this is for you.",6,0,0,11 August 2013
Straight Outta Compton," for the hip hop crowd
","This is a sort of biographical tale of how rappers Ice Cube, Easy E, and Dr Dre came to fame. I'd say you need to be a fan in order to really like this movie.The movie starts with them as teens living in South Central. The part I didn't like was how they portrayed all the cops to be bullies with no cause. I seriously doubt it's like that in South Central.Anyways they get popular in clubs and a music producer, Jerry, wants to sign them (but is really only after Ease E). So of course with money involved the friends grow apart and they get mixed up with thug, Sug Knight. Eventually E dies while the other 2 have even more success.I thought the actors portraying the rappers really played the part. And I didn't know it was Ice Cube's son playing him until looking here. Now I know why he looked so much like the real Ice Cube.FINAL VERDICT: OK, better if you were one of their fans.",6,1,18,1 August 2016
Step Up," unoriginal story, good dancing
","This movie was OK. The music and dancing were pretty good. But the story was nothing new. I did like the 2 lead actors. They helped to make the film entertaining enough to watch. Both were hot. And I think Channing Tatum should be the next break out hot star. The final dance routine that combined ballot and hip hop was one of the better dances I've seen in a film. Tyler's friends were a little annoying since they kept trying to get him in trouble and acted like he was putting them off by trying to learn a dance routine. It took Mac's little brother dying for him to see living a life of a delinquent was no way to be. Very predictable. Also, the school's principle had to be about the most predictable character I've ever seen in a film.FINAL VERDICT: If you like hip hop and dancing, then you will find this entertaining enough to watch. Otherwise, skip it.",6,0,2,28 May 2007
The Woman in Black," creepy ghost story in a marsh
","This ghost story was pretty good. Lawyer, Arthur Kipps is sent to an English village to dig up dirt on a house that is up for sale. It is apparent that the locals don't want him there and don't want him going to the Eel Marsh house. He goes to the house anyways and spots a woman in black plus hears odd noises. He goes back to the village and witnesses a child die by drinking some lye. He's given a place to stay by Daily, the rich man in town, whom has also lost a child. He tells Arthur about the legend of the woman and that a child dies soon after she is seen, but Daily is not a believer. So the last part is about Arthur trying to solve the mystery. He finds out why the ghost has come back for revenge and tries to appease her. Frankly, I didn't see how he could stay in that house with all the noises and visions going on. That would be too creepy. And why don't the villagers with kids just move.Any ways, we get a surprise, satisfying ending.FINAL VERDICT: Pretty good, worth a viewing.",6,0,0,8 February 2013
Shrek," pleasantly surprised
","Normally, I don't care for children's movies, especially animated ones. But this movie has elements for adults as well. It's fairly entertaining and there are some funny moments.  The graphics were cool too. I really liked the dragon and the castle she lived in. Eddie Murphy was great as  Donkey. His voice was perfect for him. Eddie should stick to doing voice characters. Final Verdict:  It's worth renting, even if you don't have kids.",Null,0,1,28 May 2002
Vanilla Sky," Great car crash
","This movie made more sense to me because I had seen the Spanish film, Open Your Eyes, that Vanilla Sky was based on. It followed Open Your Eyes pretty closely. Of course, one major difference was this was set in New York City. Also, I was expecting Tom Cruise to look more disfigured because in the original the Spanish guy's scars were a lot worse.  Penelope Cruz was pretty much the same in this as in the original.   I liked the car crash scene the best because Cameron Diaz really starts to sound crazy during it.  Tom should have just jumped out of the car when it was obvious she was turning psychotic.
I still can't decide if I like the ending.  I mean, when you think about it, it does make sense.  But, also seems like an easy way out to explain a lot of things that don't make sense, such as Cameron Diaz showing up after she's died.  Is Tom really crazy and seeing things or is Sofia all a figment of his mind? Is it all a dream?
FINAL VERDICT: If you are a Tom Cruise fan, then you will like this because he is really cute in this role.  The movie is OK, but it is not really a murder mystery, so don't be misled.  I recommend it if you are looking for a movie that is a little sci-fi and different from a lot of films out there. Just remember you have to pay attention throughout to get the ending.",Null,1,2,5 April 2003
X-Men: First Class," a big let down compared to first movie
","All these very positive reviews on here must be from people whom didn't see the first X-Men movie because this one pales in comparison. I really liked the first one, but this one was just not that good. The actors and characters are not as good and the story line is much slower.The main plot is how Magneto and Xavier were friends at first and worked together but then parted ways as Magento saw their mutations as a way to dominate humans. They find other mutants in the most boring musical montage. The only redeeming character is the baddie played by Kevin Bacon. He was a great bad guy.FINAL VERDICT: After seeing it, I say skip it.",5,2,4,6 March 2012
Fifty Shades of Grey," the acting was just too...
","bad, making this film just not that good. I haven't read the book so I don't know how much got left out of the movie. But I think we needed more background about why Christian was the way he was. Maybe it wasn't in the book and is being put in the sequels. Any ways I had a hard time believing someone like Christian Grey would want to get a V-card girl to be his concubine. And why a girl like that would even consider the contract.And as I have already mentioned, the acting was terrible. Dakota Johnson was wooden and no chemistry with Jamie Dornan. About all she did was show a little T&A. And Jamie wasn't much better. I am glad Charlie Hunnam turned the role down.FINAL VERDICT: Mainly for male teens that want to see what Dakota's got. Other wise not worth watching.",4,2,4,22 November 2015
The Wolverine," the wolverine franchise needs to stop here
","I love Hugh Jackman and the character of the Wolverine, but this movie was terrible. It starts out cool with Logan in Japan during World War II and saving the life of Yashida. Then it's present time and Logan is living in rural area. Yukio, working for Yashida, brings Logan to Japan where the rest of the story takes place. Yashida wants Logan's ability to heal and live for many many years, since he is dieing. He hires Viper to steel Logan's healing power. Also Logan is protecting Yashida's granddaughter, Mariko. So a lot of the movie is the bad guys chasing Mariko and Logan protecting her but without all of his abilities. And then you could see the surprise ending coming a mile away with Yashida. The whole story was just not that good.FINAL VERDICT: Wolverine is better in the X-Men films then this. You can skip this.",3,1,3,28 June 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," Overly long and dull
","What a disappointment this movie turned out to be. First it is over 2 hours and 30 minutes long. Batman doesn't even show up in the first 45 minutes. It was too drawn out and so much stuff in it had me asking why. Also the bad guy is someone named Bane. If you don't know anything about the comics like me, Bane made no sense. Little was explained about him, did he have super human powers? It seemed like he had extra strength but the guy that played him wasn't in hulk type shape. The body type didn't go with the character. Then catwoman gets thrown in. Why, she steels some stuff and some how has contact with Bane. And Bruce Wayne is so torn up, he can't do anything in the beginning. Batman hardly does anything. And at one point Bane captures Batman, how does he get him to some desert country to put him in a pit prison, then how does Wayne get back to Gotham. It made no sense.FINAL VERDICT: There's not anything about this movie that would warrant a recommendation. I'm glad I didn't pay to see it.",4,3,7,16 June 2013
Bruce Almighty," Interesting concept, but not Jim Carrey's best
","This film was OK; it had some laughs, but not Carrey's funniest.  Part of the problem was Carry and Aniston are an odd pair together, and I don't see them as a couple.  As for the good, Morgan Freeman is very likable in this part.  I liked it when the dog 'learns' to use the toliet, and the finding of Jimmy Hoffa's body was a great idea.  The monkey out of the butt sure looked painful!  But why would someone want their old job back if they just got God's powers?  You'd think Bruce would try to be President, Governor, or head of a big company.  Of course, you could second guess a lot of it since it dwelves into fantasy.FINAL VERDICT:  It's good for some laughs.  Wished Carrey got God's powers earlier in the film and did more with them.  So, it's worth seeing.",Null,10,23,7 June 2004
Casino Royale," Daniel Craig pulls off Bond
","This was a very entertaining movie and one of the better Bond films. I liked how in this version there aren't a lot of ridiculous Bond killing villain scenes. They are more realistic and the villain isn't some crazy scientist wanting to rule the world. Craig is great as bond. He's hot and sold the character well. Bond goes to the Bahamas and tracks a man supplying funds to terrorists to a very high stakes poker tournament in Europe. Eva Green is the hot bond girl and does OK. She looked a little too young for Craig in my opinion. There's even a surprise twist at the end.And the torture scene, one word 'Yikes!' FINAL VERDICT: One of the better films of the year.

","This is the best movie I have seen this year. It's got humor and those make you jump up in your seat moments. I think it is better than Night's last movie Unbreakable. I really don't understand some of these negative reviews. They must be coming from the same people who made a movie like Scooby Doo number one at the box office.
(SPOILERS):  I really thought the scene where Mel and Joaquin go running around their house at night was really funny. The lines Mel says about 'I'm in insane' and such where a hoot. 
I thought the best scene was when the family is in their house and they hear the sounds of their dog die off and see shadows on the porch and start hearing noises. That was so scary.
And I really liked how this was more than just an alien movie. It had a more serious message about losing your faith and gaining it back.
And sometimes less is better. I'm glad this movie didn't have a bunch of special effects that look so fake. The one flaw was showing the alien in full view at the end. What made it so scary was before we just saw a shadow or saw a quick shot of an arm or leg and it left the rest to your imagination. At the end, the alien should have just been in the shadows so you couldn't see any details about its appearance. I think that would have been better.
And although I do think it was strange how these tall, fast and probably strong aliens couldn't find a way into the basement, I'm not going to hold it against the rest of the film.  There were just to many good things, from the aluminum foil hats to the guy complaining about soft drink commercials during the news reports.(END OF SPOILERS)
FINAL VERDICT: A must see for any movie lover. It will give you the creeps.",10,0,2,4 August 2002
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," a movie that really wasn't about much
","Not a whole lot happens in this movie. It's about 2 American girls that go to Spain for the summer. They meet an artist, Juan Antonio. They are told he had a messy divorce in which his ex stabbed him. He invites them for a weekend in another town. Christina really wants to go and Vicky, whom is engaged, reluctantly goes. During the weekend, both end up sleeping with Juan. Upon returning to Barcelona, he begins an affair with Christina and Vicky is kind of fawning over him too but once her finance comes to Spain, and they get hitched, that ends. Juan's ex, Maria, shows up and moves in with him and Christina. They fight a lot but they start participating in threesomes. And eventually both girls go back to USA. That's it.BTW: the much talked about kiss between Scarlott and Penelope wasn't much at all. It was the only thing exciting the movie could advertise about. I certainly don't see how Penelope won an award for this role. The film was dull.FINAL VERDICT: Slow paced drama, I recommend skipping it.",6,1,4,26 May 2010
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," I'm sure the Golden Age was interesting, too bad...
","this movie wasn't about the interesting part. The story was rather boring. The costumes were very appealing as well as the make up. In this version, Elizabeth is battling Spain. Spain is trying to conquer the world. King of Spain, Phillip is Catholic, and Elizabeth is protestant. Elizabeth has a crush on Sir Walter Releigh whom has returned from the New World. She becomes highly upset when learning one of her court maidens is having his baby. Also, Elizabeth survives an assignation attempt by rival Mary Stuart, whom wants the throne. The conclusion is the famous battle between the Spanish Armada and the Brits.FINAL VERDICT: Not that great. Only for history buffs.",4,1,2,28 October 2008
Identity," I was disappointed
","I thought this movie would dwelve into the supernatural and have a cool twist.  Well, the supernatural part was just to fool you, and the twist was stupid and not scary. (SPOILERS): When we learn none of the people at the hotel were real, and it was all in Rivers' mind, that is not scary.  It's like so there isn't a  killer and no ancient spirits, so there isn't anything to be tense about.  The killings aren't that great after the first one.  The actress goes out into the pouring rain and gets attacked from behind.  Then, the others find her head in the dryer.  It goes down hill from there.   The beginning where the lady gets hit by the car was a good scene also.  But, when we learn all the people don't exist, it makes the whole part with Rhodes being an escaped con posing as a cop seem pointless. 
FINAL VERDICT:  I didn't like it too much.  This was one film where the twist doesn't lead to a good pay off.",Null,3,6,5 April 2004
Saving Mr. Banks," not much excitement
","The problem with this movie is there isn't a lot of excitement, little happens. I don't know how much is true and how much is just added on by the writer, but there isn't a lot of drama. This is more like a lifetime TV movie.It's the story of what Walt Disney had to do in order to get the rights to Mary Poppins. The writer, PL Travers, is very particular, doesn't want animation, wants the house to look like her vision, no color red, no facial hair, etc. And Disney must comply to get the rights to the film. Toward the end, she warms up to the writers and creators of the film. And intertwined throughout is flashbacks of Travers child hood, with her drunk father and depressed mother. I don't know why this was included, it wasn't a movie about the life of Travers.FINAL VERDICT: Very slow moving, many will get easily bored. So unless you like boring movies, skip it.",4,2,4,12 August 2014
Beowulf," good computer graphics but doesn't stay true to the poem
","The computer graphics in this film reminded me of a video game. They are good and look realistic for the most part. And since you aren't dealing with real actors, it made the fighting scenes a little more adventurous. I thought the sexual jokes weren't needed, I mean they are cartoon characters.In the movie, Beowulf is ready to accept King Hrothgar's challenge to kill Grendel. Grendel looks more human in the movie than usually depicted in other films. So, Beowulf fights him naked for some reason, because that is not in the poem. So, there is always some strategic placed object when showing Beowulf from the front or a dark shadow. I don't get why they had him take off his pants. He kills Grendel but then is seduced by his mother, whom is voiced by the beautiful Anjelina Jolie. Her character is drawn to resemble Jolie's face. He makes a deal with the mother, and is given the Kingdom. Some how the a charm was placed on Hrothgar and he kills himself. I don't think that was in the poem.One day, Beowulf's son shows up in the form of a dragon. What!!! How does that happen. So, the last part is him battling a dragon.FINAL VERDICT: Pretty good, I recommend it if you like adventure movies.",6,0,0,4 July 2009
Live Free or Die Hard," a popcorn flick with some really cool stunts
","This movie was better than expected. It had a plot that made sense and Detective John McClane is back with more kick @ss stunts. This time around he crashes a car into a helicopter and even out lasts a F35 through a maze of roads. This time around McClane is assigned the task of taking in a computer hacker geek to the FBI. Only problem is the guy he's taking, Matt, is about to get whacked and he walks in right before it's about to happen. So McClane gets to pull the guns out early and we are to the races. The bad guy is taking over all computer networks, so he controls phones, traffic lights, TV signals, etc... Matt is one of several hackers who helped designed a code, but he didn't know what it would be used for. So Matt and McClane stay one step ahead and try to track down the mastermind, Thomas Gabriel. McClane even gets to take on Gabriel's girl, a kung fu kicking Asian chick whom almost gets the best of him. What's amazing is that McClane can continue to get up even after jumping from a speeding car, getting shot, falling out of 3 story buildings, etc.... Most people would have broke a leg or maybe had all their skin ripped off when jumping out of a fast moving car.But anyways, it's entertaining. Definitely better than the third sequel. But hopefully this will be the last.FINAL VERDCIT: Worth seeing if you want an action film.",6,0,1,6 July 2008
X2: X-Men United," X-citing and X-cellent...
","but I still think the best comic book film is Spiderman.  Mainly because Spiderman was funny and I thought had a better villain.X-men 2 is way better than the first. The best parts were the beginning with Nightcrawler teleporting everywhere and the part where Magneto escapes because it is just so unique.  The fight between Wolverine and Deathstrike was really cool also as they slash each other time and time again. And I really liked how Mystique had a bigger role this time. She does some amazing stuff.  And Hugh Jackman looks really hot in his wife beater as he took on the army guys at the school.  Plus the music is better this time around.My one complaint is I wish it had some funny one liners. Plus, that dead Senator is back, of course as Mystique. But, how could that be possible because wouldn't he have to make a lot of public appearances, so that would mean Mystique would have to be him all the time.  Just something that made me say mmm...Now, I want to know more about how Wolverine came to be. I hope they make a movie based on Wolverine's past.FINAL VERDICT:  A must see. The best movie of the year so far.  Very entertaining with a lot of cool fights.",Null,0,0,11 May 2003
The Ringer," a comedy without any laughs....
","equals a terrible film. And that is what the Ringer is. I never laughed once. I did give it a rating of 2 because it was not the worst movie of the year, but it certainly wasn't funny. And I'm someone who likes shows like South Park and does not get offended with politically incorrect material. But this just wasn't funny. The only scene I liked was when the priest, after hearing Steve's confession, bets money on him to win the special Olympics. It is just hard to get over what Steve does because it was so low, even if it was for a good cause. And I didn't like how he gets the girl in the end because I don't think anyone girl would forgive a guy for what he did. I was rooting for Lynn's slap because Steve so deserved it.FINAL VERDICT: I don't recommend it because I didn't think it was funny. Johnny Knoxville's Jack Ass films and TV show is what you should watch if you want some laughs.",2,1,6,26 December 2006
Thor: The Dark World," the first movie of comic heroes is always the best and...
","this was no exception. The film was OK but the first one was better. The funny scenes are the best when the superhero first makes himself known or discovers the super powers. Then in the sequels everyone knows about him and it's just not as good.In this sequel little even takes place on Earth, most of it nd attacks is on Asgard. Jane and her interns discover some kind of portal to the dark world and some how she gets the aether absorbed into her, which made little sense. And the aether is a great power than can conquer worlds. Thor goes back to earth to check on Jane and then she 'zaps' people with energy and then she goes back with him to Asgard. Then this evil elf awakens attacks Asgard, chases ensue and some how they get to the dark world right where the portal to earth is. Then they go back to the earth and the elf follows. Then there is a some what tame battle on earth. Are you following me? See how crazy this is, the plot just didn't work.FINAL VERDICT: There is the Chris Hemsworth without a shirt scene, so that's cool to check out, plus the evil dudes that were rip offs of the predator were neat. I'd say this movie is for people whom don't want to think while watching.",6,0,0,11 June 2014
Lucy," good till the end
","I liked most of this movie except the ending. Lucy gets caught up in some kind of drug deal and is forced to be a mule. The experimental drug is placed inside her and leaks and basically turns her into a super smart, terminator like gal. The drug causes her to start using more of her brain cells and throughout the percentage of her brain being used is flashed on screen. She can mind read, kick butt, control computers and phones etc.... And soon she has control over matter and can manipulate objects. All the while the Korean boss is after her and I was never really sure why.Spoilers' The ending was what I didn't think made sense. Once she reaches 100 percent brain function, she just disappears, assumed to be in all electrical forces, computers, etc.... And then it just ends. There is no conclusion.FINAL VERDICT: A pretty good concept. But the movie is short and the subject is complicated. A whole lot more could have been put in, especially some sort of conclusion.",6,0,1,17 August 2015
Am√©lie," This movie is way over-rated
","What's so great about this movie? (SPOILERS)Sure, I got a few chuckles from the sex jokes and the pranks she pulls on that guy in his apartment. But, it didn't have much romance. I mean, she won't even talk to the guy she likes til the end.(END OF SPOILERS)
There was just nothing to make me say wow nor was there a scene that I cared about seeing twice.
FINAL VERDICT:  Nothing special and really not that funny.  And not to mention it is such a whip to read subtitles for a below average movie.",Null,0,3,2 August 2002
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," surprisingly good
","I was very skeptical about this movie considering the prequel trilogy was terrible. The little kid was annoying and they had annoying characters and the story line just bad.But the Star Wars of the future was much better. I liked the acting and the characters. I didn't find anyone annoying. The story made sense. The resistance had a big battle to win and the new heroes were incorporated well. Kylo Ren was sort of a whiny, weakling, but perhaps with his new training will turn into a bad foe. So convenient how he got out of alive, since Rey should have finished him off. Then there is the surprise of who his parents are and you know Leia will have something to do with his demise in the future film.FINAL VERDICT: Good adventure flick.",7,4,27,13 September 2016
RED," Bruce Willis is in his comfort zone...
","in this action film with bits of comedy thrown in. It's a revamp of Die Hard with a lot of famous castmates. Willis plays Frank, retired CIA, whom finds himself on a hit list. He goes to save this girl, Sarah, whom he's befriended, then it's off to track down other retirees. He gets Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirran to solve the mystery. It has something to do with a mission in Guatamale from 1981. And they learn CIA is trying to kill them and it goes all the way to the top: the Vice President.This is a suspend reality type of movie. It's got some funny moments and was entertaining.FINAL VERDICT: If you are looking for a popcorn flick, then this is a good choice.",7,4,5,5 December 2011
Flight," 2 different stories in one
","I thought of this film being in 2 parts. The first part was the plane crash. I thought it was well done. It was scary and keeps you guessing. First there is a shaky take off, then the plane clears it and it's clear skies, then it goes out of control. Exciting.Afterwards is the second part of the film, the more serious part, which is following an alcoholic. It turns out the pilot, Whip, is an alcoholic and was drunk on the plane but mechanical failure is what caused the crash. But that don't mean he can't get in trouble too. The ending was unbelievable because I don't think a life time liar would just tell the truth like that.Also, John Goodman has a cameo as Whip's supplier of anything. He was something else.FINAL VERDICT: I liked it and Denzel Washington was good and deserved the acting nominations. Check it out.",7,2,3,11 August 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," finally this boring series is over
","I'm so glad the last Potter film is finally over with and there will be no more of these big budget, boring movies. There was nothing in this sequel that I liked; no memorable moments or funny scenes. It was all bland, and that is such a shame since the books were so good. The Potter movies just got worse as it went along. And in this movie there wasn't even good special effects. Like in the beginning, Harry, Hermione, and Ron use magic to disguise themselves to break into a vault at the goblin bank. That's already been done in the series. It just wasn't interesting.Plus, I've never any of the actors in these movies have been very good.FINAL VERDICT: I'm so glad it's over and no more Potter films.",4,2,5,14 May 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," the movie that wouldn't end
","The fact this won best picture at the Oscars really makes the whole awards look like a joke. This was the worst of the 3 films, with the first LOTR being the best. I liked that one after several viewings, but none of the LOTR films would I call as being great. Now the third film was boring and too long. When you think it's going to end, they keep adding another 20 minutes that do nothing to bring the story to a conclusion. And the movie is over an hour old before we even she the killer spider. That spider looked neat. I can't say the special effects were bad because they were good for the most part. I was disappointed with the army of the dead. They were hardly in it and the battle they were involved in only got a couple minutes of air time. And the movie did a terrible job at explaining the elf situation. I remember from the book that they had to flee to keep from dying, and I guess it's mentioned in the movie, but it didn't make any sense. And why did they leave out the destruction of the shire and restoring it if they were going to have half hour left after the ring was destroyed.FINAL VERDICT: I'm very glad I did not pay to see this. If you saw the other two films and want to see the conclusion, then try to see it if you can. But, don't expect much because it is no where near as good as the other two.",Null,4,9,3 September 2004
Munich," got better as it went along....
","but it was still to long. About an hour in, I was thinking this movie is not very good. I didn't think the characters were introduced well and was wondering who was on screen. But, then it got better and the story made more sense, but at almost 3 hours, it was still too long. Edited to about 2 hours and 15 minutes would have been better.Eric Bana looked great in this. He was good as well as the other actors. It was just the story set-up needed to be better explained. A story like this had too much info to fit into a big screen film. It would have been better if this was a made for TV 5 part movie. Characters like Louis and his dad and the other killers besides Avner did not get enough development. I would have liked to know more about there back ground.FINAL VERDICT: A good film on an important subject matter, but was too long. If you aren't familiar with the story, it is hard to understand some of the characters. Overall, worth watching.",7,3,4,11 January 2007
Godzilla," the story missed the mark
","This Godzilla remake wasn't that good. The main problem was the poor script and the personal relationships. The only 2 interesting people were the scientists, Joe and his wife, and neither last very long. The main character, Ford, was poorly written and acted and his wife, played by Elizabeth Olsen, was such a lame character. Even their kid was used poorly and gave nothing to the story.As already mentioned, the darkness of the film was too much and Godzilla did not get enough screen time. I thought the special effects were good, but Godzilla should have been shown in longer than 90 second clips. Perhaps the MUTOs were the best part of the movie.FINAL VERDICT: Watch at your own risk. There isn't enough monster action and the characters are so bad.",4,0,4,21 January 2015
Shall We Dance," pointless
","This movie had only one good scene and that was when Richard Gere goes to see his wife with a rose;otherwise, there was nothing worthwhile. J-Lo didn't seem to have much screen time, mainly because her character basically does nothing. All she does is watch dance lessons and cheer on the dancers at the end. Richard Gere dances more in this than her. Her character should have just been deleted.And I didn't get why Gere was ashamed to tell his wife about dancing lessons. It's not a big deal. That's why the movie isn't much good because the topic is boring. There just isn't much drama about dancing lessons.Plus the little cutesy jokes fell flat. None of the characters were charming.FINAL VERDICT: A movie about a middle age married man signing up for dancing lessons is not my idea of entertainment. I don't recommend it.",4,1,5,24 September 2005
Looper," overly complicated
","This is one of those sci-fi movies in which the plot just gets to complicated and there are too many loop holes. Bruce Willis is looking really old and Joeseph Gordon Levitt is becoming a lead actor. I think he is really entertaining in movies. JGL is Joe, a guy known as a looper. He kills guys that are sent back from the future by the mob. Closing a looper is when the older looper is sent back to be executed by his younger self. This happens to Joe, but the older joe gets away. So he needs to kill his older self before the mob kills him, why, I'm not exactly sure. The older Joe is looking to kill the evil Rainmaker as a child. So, he has 3 kids that may be the rainmaker. And the younger Joe picks the right house to begin with. So, you see how complicated this gets. So in the end the younger Joe must come up with a plan to stop the Rainmaker from doing his evil things in the future.FINAL VERDICT: I didn't care for it because the plot just got too out there.",5,2,4,6 May 2013
Life," liked the creepy ending
","Even though this film borrows heavily from Aliens, I still thought it was good. A space crew collects an organism from Mars and conducts experiments on it. It becomes aggressive and it doesn't take long before it uses humans for food. Lots of cool stuff happen, the captain goes outside the station and is attacked, but lack of fuel allows it back in. Best part is the ending, the last 2 survivors come up with a plan. There are 2 escape pods, one will lure the creature into it and go into deep space with manual override. The other will make it to earth. Well, the pod going to earth hits debree and is sent of course. And as though the creature is reading the guy's mind, it prevents his hand from holding the controller and it goes to earth. Creepy.FINAL VERDICT: One big plot hole is when still in the lab, why wouldn't they seal the air vents as soon as it attacks the first guy. It would never have gotten out. It's a good thriller with good effects, worth checking out.",6,0,1,21 October 2017
Footloose," horrible movie and acting
","I have not seen the original so I'm basing my opinion on just this film, and it was awful. First Julianna Hough and Kenny Wormald are horrible actors. Yes, they can dance, but giving them speaking parts equals bad idea. Second, a movie about dancing should have a great sound trak and this one was terrible. The only good song was Footloose, which of course is from the original. There's also some kind of rap/dance song in which Hough looks like a slut. I mean, she is supposed to play a high school girl, and she is wiggling all over these guys very suggestively, it's just gross and inappropriate for a movie aimed at teens. Lastly, the plot is nonexistent. It's about a town that has banned dancing. Can anyone say snooze fest.FINAL VERDICT: Not worth anyone's time.",2,7,10,13 August 2012
Hart's War," I didn't know German prison camps were so comfortable
","There were so many things that just didn't make sense.  Like why are the Alli planes shooting at train cars that say POW on top. Why don't they call in troops to free the POWs.  Why are the POWs so orderly and clean in the German prison camp.  Why do they get along so well with the German soldiers who execute prisoners when they want too.  I didn't know Germans who were close to losing the war would be so willingly to give the Americans all their rights, like a right to a trial.  All of this is just pure rubbish.The only positive thing  is Colin Farrell, not because he is good in this, but because he has been good in other movies.  I didn't like Bruce Willis in this role.  He just isn't a good dramatic actor.(SPOILERS): When Willis turns himself in at the end to die for the other soldiers, are we supposed to cry or something?  The plot was written too poorly to really care what happens to these people.  Willis should have been a stronger character.(END OF SPOILERS)FINAL VERDICT: No wonder this big budget movie was such a box office flop. It isn't emotional enough and just too many inaccuracies.  And don't expect any war action. Best to avoid this one.",Null,0,2,12 May 2003
Get Him to the Greek," Aldous was not as funny being the main character
","I was really looking forward to this movie because in Forgetting Sarah Marshall Russell Brand was hilarious as rock star, Aldous Snow. And Jonah Hill was very funny as the obsessed guy.But that character is a one trick pony and it just doesn't work as the main character in this film. There were some funny things, but it is just not enough for a whole movie. And Jonah Hill comes back playing a different character.The whole African Child video in the beginning was funny, perhaps the best part. But the movie tries to get most of its laughs by having the characters do crazy stuff while high instead of having funny situations like in FSM. Also, besides African Child the movie didn't use enough of Aldous's crazy song lyrics.P Diddy is in this and plays a record executive that only knows how to cuss all the time. It's cute the first couple of times but good comedic writing needs more than dirty words to be funny.FINAL VERDICT: It's got some laughs, but don't expect anything great. Worth watching on cable.",5,2,8,15 March 2011
300," stylized visuals but a been there done that story
","The plot to this movie wasn't anything unique. The story takes place in ancient times. The Persuians meet with the Spartans asking them to surrender. The Spartan King Leonidas kills them and raises an army of 300 to meet the Persuians at a narrow passageway near the ocean to head them off. For a couple of days there are able to hold off the massive Persuian army before a traitor does them in.The visuals are pretty neat. The color is filtered to give it an older, duller look. The blood isn't as red. For fans of blood and gore, there are a lot of beheadings and dead bodies. Lots of people stabbed but not many close up shots. The fighting scenes have slow motion and just look cool. But the story isn't anything special.FINAL VERDICT: I don't think it is as good as a lot of reviews on here have it. But, if you like violent action films, this is for you. The story just isn't smart enough to get a top rating from me.",5,0,0,2 March 2008
The Hangover Part III," It's all about Alan
","I thought this one was better than the second sequel but of course, the first one is still the best. This movie doesn't even have a 'hangover'. It's just about the same characters and revolves around Alan. The movie begins in a disgusting way, with Alan decapitating a giraffe. They really shouldn't have showed that.Any ways, Mr. Chow has stole some money from a gangster and the gangster believes the Wolfpack is the way to find it. He holds Doug hostage and wants the guys to bring him Chow. They track down Chow and rob a house and get back stabbed and then go back to Vegas. And even more hi-jenks ensue. Alan even meets a lady.FINAL VERDICT: It was OK, had some funny moments, but I don't think anyone expects it to be as good as the first one.",6,2,3,7 April 2014

The person whom spread it eventually admits it to Olive to get her to take the bad rap.

Fast Five," no longer a car movie, this is a slick heist flick
","This sequel has basically moved away from the core of the first film which was about fast cars and slick driving into a pure seemingly impossible heist film. And I do have to say the way they pull of the whole vault theft was pretty good.The plot is Dom, Brain, and Mia are living in Rio de Janerio and on the run. It starts out with a pretty good action of them along with some other bad guys stealing cars out of a moving train. I don't think I believe that's possible, but it was still cool to watch. Any ways these guys there are working with work for the drug lord criminal of all of Rio, Reyes. They take this car that Reyes wanted and it turns out a chip was hidden in it that tells the locations of where Reyes hides his money.Mean while, the Rock plays a US agent hunting them down in Brazil. Dom decides to pull of the heists of all heist and sends for help, where we get some other characters from previous films. So, then we get to see if the plan works.BTW, the whole part of 2 cars pulling a very heavy fault down the street and racing was very silly. No way that is possible, but it was still entertaining.FINAL VERDICT: I like impossible heist movies, so I give it a positive recommendation.",7,3,6,9 April 2012
Green Book," The summary of this movie did not sound promising....
","But it is very good and entertaining. When I read it's about 2 guys going on a concert tour in the South when racism was prevalent, I thought it would be boring. But it wasn't and was very good. It's got some humor like when Tony introduces Shirley to fried chicken. The final when Shirley stands up for himself at the restaurant and won't back down was very good. A really good message behind it. And then he goes to the bar and plays the blues with some other musicians. The acting by both leads was top notch. I see why both were nominated and why Ali won. And considering most films now days are not that good, I think this was a good pick for best picture.FINAL VERDICT: Great story , definitely check it out.",8,2,3,16 December 2019
Honey," hip-hop fluff
","Nothing is original about Honey. Jessica Alba plays a dancer who teaches kids at a community center and has dreams of dancing in music videos. Well, she gets her big break, but it doesn't turn out smelling like roses. Of course, the guy that helps her acts like a jerk in the end. She realizes leaving the kids was a mistake and has a dance fund raiser to buy a new building to teach dance lessons. The only reason to watch this is if you like Jessica because she does look hot in the mid-drift baring shirts. But, the music is terrible and you can't wait till it's over.FINAL VERDICT: Boring, mindless, dribble. I don't recommend it.",Null,3,6,4 October 2004
Fantastic Four," lackluster superhero movie
","This movie fails in comparison to recent superhero movies like Spiderman or Superman or X-men. The special effects are not as good. They sort of looked cheesy, especially Mr. Fantastic's stretching arm. BTW, how does his clothes stretch with his arm. For instance, in one scene he's writing on a chalkboard wearing a white lab coat. The coat stretches with the arm. How is that possible? The plot wasn't that great. Simply not as interesting as the X-men movies. The film has there best actor, Michael Chiklis, on the back burner, and most of the time looking like a scary rock.The movie tries to have a few cute, funny scenes, but they fail. Like shaving cream on the Thing's hand while sleeping during the short musically skit. It was out of place and not funny.FINAL VERDICT: I don't know why they are making a sequel to this. It's a waste of money. 12 year old boys may like this but I think most people would rather skip it.",4,1,3,15 September 2006
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," why do so many people see this at the theater
","This film was a little better than New Moon, but that isn't saying much. It's still rather boring and is just silly. What is it with Victoria running crazy fast through the woods? I mean that makes her really bad. Why can the guy vampire get into Bella's house to look around but she can't. And why didn't he just wait in the house for Bella. And Kristen Stewart just looks silly with these ridiculous facial expressions, do I choose a vampire or werewolf. You would think a vampire army would be a little exciting, but I sure didn't think so. The werewolf CGI is really bad.FINAL VERDICT: Only watch it if you can see it for free.",6,5,6,28 June 2011
Click," a man's dream- a remote for everything
","The whole concept of this movie is sometimes you don't always want what you wish for. Adam Sandler plays Michael, a guy who has a great family, but seems to be too preoccupied with his job. He's more concerned about pay raises then spending quality family time. One night he goes to a bed, bath, beyond, which is quite funny while he's in the store. He finds a door that says beyond above it and discovers this wacky guy who has a remote he's been looking for. But this is a special remote. It does what ever you want. Mutes sound, distorts images, fast forwards through what ever you want it too. So Michael uses it skip cold showers, traffic and he can't wait,so uses it to skip to his promotion. Only problem is months go by and he doesn't know what happened in the past. His wife just sees him as a barely conscious work alcoholic and of course this cause marriage problems. He gets fat and so does his son, and his daughter begins to dress like a hooker. And after one fast forward he learns he is divorced and his wife is remarried, but he is a very successful architect.And the wacky guy turns out to be a dark angle. It's like other movies with showing what your life will be like if you don't make changes and put family first. Michael wakes up to find it a dream.This movie is first part comedy, second part drama. David Hasselhoff is funny as the boss as well as the bratty neighbor kid. And Jennifer Coolidge is her usual greatness.FINAL VERDICT: One of Sandlers better films. I thought the first part had a lot of laughs and the film does teach a lesson in the end. I recommend it.",7,1,3,3 May 2007
Pineapple Express," this was funny, but I give it a 6 because....
","I just really don't like movies or TV shows that glorify pot like it is no big deal. And not only that, the 2 potheads deal to school age kids like it's no big deal. Not every kid wants to try pot and selling to kids is very wrong and not funny. Also, I think some of the Hollywood liberals need to remember that pot is still illegal. But after looking over that part, James Franco and Seth Rogan are funny in this.Dale witnesses a murder by a big time drug dealer and he throws his roach out his car before leaving. Ted, the dealer, recognizes the pot as Pineapple Express and knows the dealer he gave it too, Saul. Dale runs over to Saul's in hysterics and they soon realize, Ted maybe able to track them through the Pineapple Express, so they go on the run. They have a whole escape in the woods. They go to Red's to find out what he knows about Ted. The time they spend at Red's is funny and they are involved in one huge house fight. Dale warns his girlfriend at a funny dinner scene. The 2 track Ted and Saul is in heaven when he is caught and taken to the big pot growing plant. The final showdown is when the Korens show up, whom also want a big slice of the drug market.FINAL VERDICT: Good, lots of fowl language, so if that doesn't bother you, check this out.",6,1,4,2 August 2009
John Wick: Chapter 2," was this a movie or shoot um up video game
","The biggest problem with this sequel is it seemed more like a video game than anything else. We basically have 3 separate shoot um up scenes. The film opens with a motorcycle and car chase scene, the escape through the catacombs scene, and the scene on the mirror floor. Plus the whole concept of an underground assassin network was done in the first film. The fights were just so polished with fake blood spraying every once in a while, it really seemed like you were watching someone play a video game.FINAL VERDICT: Just too choreographed for me, but if you like bad a$$ action, then you want to check it out. And now Wick fans will have to wait for part 3.",5,0,1,22 October 2017
A Walk to Remember," surprisingly good
","This movie doesn't have an original plot, but it is good because of the 2 leads give wonderful performances.  Mandy Moore is especially good as the straight-laced preacher's daughter.  And I liked how they showed the transformation of Shane West's character.  It was very believable. Of course, the ending won't leave you dried-eyed.  It's sad, but we get to witness a sort-of 'miracle' as the film puts it of how a wayward teen turns his life around.  The music was great too.
FINAL VERDICT:  I definitely recommend this. It isn't just some teen movie. The film has depth and the acting is much better than you would expect.",Null,249,297,28 January 2003
Sin City," too cartoonish for my taste
","I didn't think this movie was that great. The story reminds me of a cartoon. People keep getting shot, even in the head but never die. There are impossible car chase scenes and some guy named Kevin, who must be half vampire. He can jump 6 feet in the air and apparently likes human flesh. There are 3 different stories and all three of the main characters end up at this same strip joint but they don't know each other.It was violent but not realistic. You have a few red splatters of blood. People get knifed, have their throat slashed, and even beheaded. And the guy that gets beheaded won't die. He's got something in his head but won't die. Then his face still moves after he's beheaded. It was just too silly.And the gun toting prostitutes were silly. All they were there for is to prance around in skimpy outfits. It just didn't make a lot of sense.FINAL VERDICT: I don't recommend it. I don't want to see a serious film that is more like a cartoon.",4,3,6,16 February 2006
The Ugly Truth," the jokes have been done before but...
","it's still funny. I'm surprised that there are so many negative reviews here. I thought this was a fairly funny movie. Sure, there's some swearing, but it's certainly not over the top, and I didn't find it distracting as I find it in some films.Katherine Heigl plays, Abby, a TV control freak producer, whom has just had a new segment added to her morning show. Gerad Butler is Mike, host of the Ugly Truth, whom is the new hit on the TV show. Abby doesn't like his chauvinist ways, but soon begins taking his advice while pursuing Dr. Colin. Of course the ending isn't hard to figure out between Abby and Mike.There were some funny scenes in this. My 3 favorite were: When Abby falls out of the tree, hanging there with her dress up side down. Abby and Colin at the baseball game when she's on the big screen. I was dying laughing. And when at the dinner with her bosses, Abby's vibrating underwear gets turned on by a kid. Very funny.FINAL VERDICT: I think this is worth seeing.",7,0,3,14 March 2010
Gangs of New York," A Tale of Revenge...
","intertwined between a hodgepodge of story lines. There are just way too many story lines to follow. You have all the politics, all the varies gangs, and racism even thrown in. This movie, which centers around revenge, fails when compared to a great revenge story like Gladiator. If the story had just stuck with LD trying to get DDL back for killing his father, it would have been much better and shorter. I just could not get into the plot as much as I could with other epic movies.DDL is really good as Bill the Butcher and deserves to be nominated for acting awards. But, I didn't think to much of LD and CD's attempts at Irish accents. Sometimes it sounded like they had them and other times the accent was lost.As for the opening battle scene between the 2 gangs, it wasn't that great. I have heard it compared to scenes from Braveheart and Gladiator, but it was no where near as good. You couldn't see much of what was going on because of the short camera shots that skipped around, and there was no where near as much as blood and gore as there was in Braveheart or Gladiator.(SPOILERS): As for the final, there isn't much of a pay off. We want to see LD really kick the crap out of DDL and knife him up like DDL had done to so many people throughout the movie. But, instead, DDL is wounded by a bomb, and all LD has to do is use his knife. There isn't much of a fight between them. The ending should have been more climatic. And as for the bombing, I didn't really understand why the ships were shooting bombs at the place where the gangs were going to fight because that was not where the mob was. Just another complaint that makes the story hard to follow and not too good.(END OF SPOILERS)FINAL VERDICT: I wouldn't say this is bad, just average. I would just skip it at the theater because it is so long. But, DDL makes it worth watching if you can catch it on cable some time. Just don't expect a great story.",Null,0,0,29 December 2002

The Cabin in the Woods," a comedy posing as a horror story
","This is a very misleading story. You think it is going to be about some kids go to a cabin in the woods and something creepy happens, like it's haunted or there are monsters. But in reality they are in a science experiment. We learn that a bunch of betting, goofy scientists have planned their trip to the woods without them knowing. And when the 2 survivors learn the truth, it gets really bloody and blows your mind as to what is really going on. And how are the Japanese kids so smart. I liked the originality of it all.FINAL VERDICT: Different, a unique twist on a horror story. If you like lots of blood, check it out.",7,1,3,8 February 2013
Windtalkers," just bullets, not much of a story
","This movie was OK, but certainly lacking when it comes to a plot. And the war action was not up to par with recent films. We mainly see bullets and explosions. Not a lot of blood or gore. The war scenes in We Were Soldiers were so much better.There is no depth to the story. We never learn much about Nic Cage's character, Joe and what makes him the way he is.  We learn a little more about the Navajo, Ben, who Joe is assigned to protect. And the whole movie is about this Navajo secret code. Well, we hardly even see the 2 Navajo's in this movie even use it.  If they played such an important role in the Pacific, the code should have been emphasized more.  The plot just seemed like a lazy excuse to film a war movie.And I also have to say something about the musical score. Basically, it was awful. It was so uninspiring and added nothing to the battle scenes. It was boring and just didn't fit. The Navajo flute was the only good music.FINAL VERDICT:  One of the worst war movies in recent years. Of course, it isn't as bad as Pearl Harbor, but no where near the greatness of Saving Private Ryan. Considering the battle scenes aren't that good, I don't recommend it, even if you really like war movies, because you will be disappointed.",Null,1,2,3 October 2003
Her," an original take on the future
","I thought this movie was good with a different outlook on the future of dating. Theodore is recently divorced and buys an OS to be a companion, someone to talk to. He can choose the OS to be male or female, so chooses female, and she gives herself the name, Samantha. Theo wears an earpiece and has a little camera he can put in the pocket of his shirt, and that is how he communicates with Samantha. They talk about everything, and being the lonely person he is, Theo falls for the computer. And the weird thing is, this seems to be fairly common. When he tells his friends, they aren't completely shocked and get the fact that he is dating a computer.Well, this romance is 'weird', like Samantha hiring a girl to be her pretend 'body'. But it seems all the OSs are growing and soon they sort of form their own group and Samantha is becoming more independent and before long wants her space. And Theo is devastated to learn Samantha is in love with others, like over 600. And in the end, does what he should have done in the beginning, which is hang out with a real girl.FINAL VERDICT: Interesting take on the future. I recommend it.",7,0,1,21 January 2015
Slumdog Millionaire," great script, something different
","This was a great movie and I can see how it deserved the Oscar for best picture. It takes a simple concept and tells a tale of childhood love with a happy ending. The story is about an orphan that survived the slums of Mumbi and is now a contestant on Who wants to be a Millionaire. Jamal has made it to the final question. He is being questioned as to how he knew all the answers. Through this, we get to see how he grew up and the relationship between his brother and the girl he fell in love with, Latika. Basically, everything he's done has been to find Latika again.The story was very entertaining and it was just a new idea. I really enjoyed it.FINAL VERDICT: Highly recommend this one.",9,0,5,23 October 2009
Mad Max: Fury Road," a mindless, boring chase film
","This movie was bad because nothing happens except a chase in a desert, where there is nothing to look at. For some reason this one arm chick decided to steal this crazy leader's wives(aka breeders)and is chased in the desert. And for some reason most of the crazy leader's followers are pasty white and bald. Why they don't have a tan in a desert? I don't know.Any way, this guy is tied to the front of a truck chasing the one arm chick and when all vehicles explode he lives and after fighting with the chicks, decided to ride with them. They're searching for a green area which doesn't exist so they go back from where they escaped. And during all this, you just have crazy people chasing them and vehicles exploding but there always seems to be more.FINAL VERDICT: Just a bad movie.

Hacksaw Ridge," a good war movie
","This story was based on a true guy, Desmond Doss, whom didn't believe in violence, yet enlisted in the army. He wants to be a medic. In the first part of the film, it shows some of his family problems, and him meeting a girl he knows he wants to marry. He goes to basic training and gets in trouble for disobeying orders. But his rights are upheld and he is able to marry before being shipped off. Of course, his fellow soldiers don't think much of him because he won't use a gun. But they enter a battle at Hacksaw Ridge and Doss proves to be the bravest of them all, by saving many wounded soldiers when all the other survivors left. There is quite a bit of gory violence, missing limbs, I thought it was pretty realistic as to what war would have been like at that time.FINAL VERDICT: So if you enjoy war movies, you will like this one.",7,0,1,31 July 2017
The Runaways," like a bad episode of vh1j's behind the music
","This movie paled in comparison to some of the shows vh1 has done about bands. There's usually just a lot more craziness going on that what this movie showed. Sure there's drug use, but it's tame for some rockers.The movie starts in LA where Joan Jett and Cherie Currie are still teens in the club scene. Joan teams up with a music producer and they find other players for the band and eventually hire Cherie to be lead singer. The band's big gimmick is they are still teens. Next thing you know, they are touring overseas, which I don't see how since they didn't have parents with them. They start the drug use, but nothing to wild. Cherie gets a big ego and gets more attention, leading to tension in the band. And I guess they just broke up, the movie does not give enough details here.FINAL VERDICT: vh1 does it better",5,2,2,8 March 2011
Gladiator," I love this movie
","Gladiator is terrific.  It is definitely one of my top 5 films of all time. I'm sure everyone knows the plot by now. Russell Crowe is one bad a**  MF that kicks major b*tt.  Not to mention he looks so hot as he is decapitating and slashing the competition.  But what makes this movie great is the story line is heart felt and you feel for Maximus after his family is murdered. It is the ultimate tale of revenge.
Russell Crowe is a great actor. I never heard of him before Gladiator but since seeing this I have watched a bunch of other films he is in. He's pretty good in them all. He should have won the oscar for The Insider and for A Beautiful Mind rather than Gladiator though, but just because those two movies were more 'oscar-like'.
FINAL VERDICT:  A definite must see. I have this one on tape to watch it over and over again.",10,5,7,29 May 2002

That is the question I would like answered.  But, I did like how creepy that bunny was, telling Donny to do mean things.(END OF SPOILERS)

","Sam Witwicky can keep getting supermodels as girlfriends. That was the most unbelievable part of the film. He's replaced Megan Fox with some Victoria Secret's model. And in this movie, he doesn't even have a job. That part right there just makes this whole movie seem so silly.In this movie, the decepticans have another scheme involving pillars stolen from a crashed ship on the moon. The film intertwines real people and happenings like Neil Armstrong and walking on the moon with the fictitious robot story. Optimus Prime goes to the moon and brings back an old alli, only he can revive. What he doesn't know is the alli has made a deal with the deceopticans as he is the only one whom can use the pillars and transport their planet to earth and take all of earth's resources.So Sam and his friends do a bunch of crazy action stunts to stop the decepticans.

The Social Network," don't use facebook, so I really didn't find this movie very interesting
","First while there is some good dialog, the movie's downfall is that it was too long at over 2 hours. Also, there isn't a lot that happens since it is just a film about the start up of facebook. Mark Zuckerberg is portrayed as sort of a nerd/genius but he is also a jerk with how he treats his one good friend, Eduardo. He basically tosses him aside once the hip, outgoing Sean Parker shows up, whom has connections to get facebook funded.FINAL VERDICT: I didn't think it was that great, but I can see how a lot of people would find it entertaining. Since I don't care anything about Facebook, I say skip it.",Null,2,4,14 July 2011
The Pursuit of Happyness," I didn't know Will Smith could be so good
","I was very impressed with Will Smith's acting performance. This was his best by far. I'm surprised he didn't win all the acting awards. The movie is touching and inspirational. It was also very entertaining. It sure didn't seem like it ran over 2 hours. The story is about Chris Gardner and his son. His wife leaves him during a time of financial troubles. He takes an internship as a stockbroker and getting paid nothing for 6 months in hope that he will be the one person who gets a job. While learning to be a broker, he continues to sell medical equipment, his only source of income. He loses him home and must find a way to take care of his son. Sometimes it is sleeping in a bathroom at the train station. In better times, it is getting a room at the shelter. He learns to do his job faster than everyone else because he has his son to take care of, which means picking him up at daycare and getting in line at the shelter in time.He just does his job and doesn't complain and in the end is rewarded for his struggles. A true American dream.FINAL VERDICT: Very inspirational. Smith does a great job and you really hope he is rewarded.",8,0,0,24 October 2007
The Bourne Supremacy," confusing plot that left me not carrying what Jason Bourne does
","I thought the Bourne Identity was OK but nothing special. At least the plot was better and so was Matt Damon. Damon in this is boring and he only has one scene I can think of in which he uses those neat kung fu moves. Plus he does everything alone here. A lot of it is just him sneaking around in a black trench coat. You'd think he would have changed clothes or worn a disguise since they knew what he was wearing, yet this super spy never bothers to change his appearance.And the plot didn't make a whole lot of sense. I'm guessing a lot was left out that was in the books. Like why do they keep hunting Bourne when he just wants to stay in hiding. And when did some guy from Russia become involved. And why frame Bourne for murder by planting a fingerprint when he wasn't even trying to become involved.Besides a confusing plot, the other big negative was the shaky camera. AT times, you couldn't even tell what was going on. It was almost as bad as the jerky camera shots from the Blair Witch Project.FINAL VERDICT: I don't recommend it because it just wasn't very entertaining nor is Matt Damon any where near as hot.",4,2,4,17 June 2005

Eventually, Nick learns that Gatsby really is not all that fabulous and is trying to impress Daisy with all the showing off of money which he really doesn't have. Then jealousy comes into play and we see how selfish Daisy and her hubby really are.FINAL VERDICT: It's OK for a drama, a little to long, but worth a viewing.",6,0,3,10 April 2014
The Proposal," one of the worst of the year
","I'm shocked at how many good reviews this movie got here. I thought it was terrible and one of the worst movies I've seen. I found nothing funny about it all. It was one of the most poorly written scripts I've seen. What's funny about an eagle stealing a little dog and what's funny about naming a dog Kevin? How about nothing. From Betty White doing a crazy dance in the wood and then Sandra Bullock singing that dirty song with her to the silly town stripper to the baby maker blanket, nothing was funny and it was so poorly written.Also Bullock and Reynolds had absolutely no chemistry together. Plus I couldn't get over the fact that Sandra Bullock is like over 10 years older than Ryan Reynolds and looks it. I mean, it is just not believable that he would fall in love with her over a couple of days in Alaska when he couldn't stand her in New York.FINAL VERDICT: I now see why Bullock won that award for worst actress for this movie. It was deserving.",1,12,24,25 April 2010
Shark Tale," good animation, didn't think the songs or jokes were that great
","Shark Tale keeps up with the spectacular CGI effects of recent cartoon films. However, the film is a parody of the Godfather films, which are films kids haven't seen. So, I don't think Shark Tale makes a good kid film since they wouldn't get a lot of the jokes. Also, I didn't care for the rap and hip-hop music in this. I liked the look of the sharks from Nemo better than this movie. The Jamacian jellyfish was a neat idea and a couple of the best characters. The plot was simple as it was in Nemo, it just wasn't as entertaining.One thing's for sure: even as a fish, Angie Jolie is one hot moma!FINAL VERDICT: I just don't see this as being a film kids really love. I don't recommend this if you are over 15.",6,2,4,6 September 2005

","story sort of boring. I didn't think this was that great of a film. Yes, Terrence Howard gives a good acting performance, but I didn't find the movie that entertaining since it doesn't have much of a plot. It's about a pimp who just has a couple of girls he pimps out of his car. He wants to become a rapper like one of the guys he grew up with. He runs into an old friend who is in the recording business and gets him to record some songs. He gets into some trouble at the end, but still gets his music played on the radio. I don't really find a pimp to be someone to root for.Since I'm not much of a fan of rap, I didn't care for all the music in this.

So when R has a chance to attack Julie, he recognizes her and begins talking and gets her to safety. How is this possible? Well it seems the zombies are coming back to life, of course this is never explained. They are the walking dead, but come back to life, really far fetched. Of course, Julie's dad doesn't understand the blossoming love between her and R, but it's easy for her friend to accept. And the bad guys in this are the bonies.

The plot is too much to take, skip it.",4,1,2,30 December 2013

Then we get a visual of the flight that day and how the plane landed in the water. And in conclusion, we get insight into the investigation and whether Sully and the co pilot made the right decision.FINAL VERDICT: Overall, it was interesting, just not enough for a full length movie.

Valkyrie," the plot actually made sense.
","I remember when this movie was in theaters and it was getting a lot of bad reviews. I just figured it was another role in which Tom Cruise is totally unbelievable. And the story would be hard to follow. Well, Cruise was OK, and the story was easy to follow. It is about a group of Germans that want to assassinate Hitler and take over Germany to sign a truce with the Allies. They don't want to see Europe destroyed.Cruise plays Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg whom is leading the attempt on Hitler's life. He's got a lot of convincing to do in order to get other officers to go with the plan because they know if it fails, it will be considered treason. Even when the plan seems to go as planned, the other accomplices are still hesitant to go forward with the plan.FINAL VERDICT: It's a little too long but I thought it was easy enough to follow.

The Simpsons Movie," Just like the TV show, so why make it a movie
","I used to watch the Simpsons all the time, but grew out of it when I got out of high school. So, I haven't seen the TV show in many years. But still this movie seemed just an extended TV episode. You are a sucker just like Homer said if you paid to watch this. I watched it on cable. The plot deals with the pollution of Springfield. It gets so bad the government encloses Springfield in a dome and a lot of it has to do with something Homer did. So Homer and the fam find a way to escape the dome and move to Alaska. But of course, Marge and the kids can't leave everyone behind, especially when plans are to wipe out Springfield. They go back to help and eventually Homer gives in and goes to.To me it seemed like the cartoon uses most of the same jokes and plot points it did 10 years ago. I think one gets tired of it after about 5 years.FINAL VERDICT: Only worth seeing if you are a fan of the current TV show.",4,3,6,6 July 2008
Draft Day," completely unbelievable
","NFL GMs aren't as dumb as depicted in this movie. Kevin Costner plays, Sonny, the new GM of the Browns, taking over for his deceased father. They have the 7th pick but are interested in a hot shot QB that is expected to go No 1. Now Sonny waits till draft day to do a little digging on the QB. As if a GM would wait till the last minute. Anyways he trades 3 NO 1's to Seattle for the NO 1 pick. There's a running back the coach wants and a linebacker with a heart of gold on Sonny's radar.The draft starts and Sonny selects the linebacker. Other GMs contact him and want to know what is wrong with the QB. They show the new GM of the Jaguars to be a complete idiot. Sonny trades for their NO 1 pick at 6. He then contacts Seattle and says he'll trade 6 for the rest of their NO 1's back and a punt returner. So Seattle excepts and gets the QB for a cheaper price that Sonny never wanted. Sonny gets the running back at 7 plus the punt returner and all the Brown's picks back. So as you can see no GM is that dumb to get played like that.FINAL VERDICT: I'd say this is for football fans only. It is rather dull and why did Sonny have to have a pregnant co-worker 30 years his junior as a side plot.",6,3,5,9 February 2015
The Soloist," good acting but...
","didn't seem very original. I guess that's why this movie didn't do very well at the theater. The movie is about a news columnist, Steve, that starts a conversation with a homeless person, Nathaniel, whom he finds playing a broken violin. Nathaniel tells him he is a Julliard drop out, and Steve sees an opportunity to turn this into a story. He tracks him down and asks him more questions and when the first column comes out, a reader sends Nathaniel a cello, which is what he originally played. Steve gives him the cello and it leads to him trying to help Nathaniel get off the streets and get him involved with the local sympathy.Foxx and Downey were good. But something in this movie just lacked capturing your attention. The overall story wasn't good enough and there wasn't a lot that happened.FINAL VERDICT: I only recommend it if you are a fan of one of the stars.",6,1,2,3 January 2010
Dodgeball," very disappointed
","I'm not sure why so many seem to think this was really funny because I sure didn't. It was stupid. This was in theaters last year the same time Anchorman was and many said this was better than Anchorman. I totally disagree. Anchorman actually had laughs.As the title suggests, this is your typically Hollywood Underdog story involving a sport. In this case, it's dodgeball. Maybe the producers thought, dodgeball: now that's funny and entertaining, but they sure missed the boat. Sure, you played dodgeball in grade school and it's fun, but it is not funny just because some misfits are playing it. The only good part was Ben Stiller's over the top character. But, he got annoying because the accent was simply terrible.FINAL VERDICT: I don't recommend it because it just wasn't very funny.",3,5,13,2 September 2005
Rock Star," No wonder this wasn't in theaters long...
","Very mediocre and cliche after cliche after cliche. I rarely find a movie predictable, but this was one where I knew exactly what would happen.
Jennifer Aniston was the best part about the movie. I really wasn't expecting anything from her, but I liked her performance. I think she broke away from her Friends' character.  The music was OK also. Those were the two things that made this movie watchable since you know exactly where the story is going before it gets there.
Mark Wahlberg wasn't that great. I thought he would turn out to be a good actor from what I saw in Boogie Nights. But, he hasn't done anything great since then. I felt he was miscast in this part.  He just doesn't look like an 80's rocker to me. He's to short and small and not enough attitude.
FINAL VERDICT: Too predictable. Only worth watching if you really like the music.",5,2,5,17 August 2002
The Martian," Suspenseful tale of how..
","to survive on Mars long enough to be rescued. This was a good movie. Matt Damon is part of a group of astronauts on Mars. A huge storm comes and they must evacuate. Damon is hit by debree, suit punctured, so he is presumed dead and left behind. But the pole that went into him stopped the suit leak and he survived. He must grow food and make the rations last longer. He finds an older satellite and can communicate with earth. NASA comes up with a plan to save him. Of course, things don't go according to the plan. But the crew that left him behind, is brave and does the right thing and they get their guy back.FINAL VERDICT: It's cool to see how a hopeless situation works out. Definite recommend.",8,3,5,28 July 2016
Evil Dead II," This sucked compared to the first Evil Dead
","I knew this film wasn't supposed to be scary like the first Evil Dead. I thought it was supposed to be more of a funny horror movie. Well, I didn't get many laughs. If you want to see a funny horror movie with a lot of gore, then see Dead Alive. That one was great.  This movie is basically a rehash of the first Evil Dead, except it leaves out all the creepy things.
(SPOILERS): A couple of things I did like was when the eyeball lands in that girl's mouth.  And all this blood sprays out of the cellar onto the girl. And I liked it when Ash says 'Groovy', as he is getting the chainsaw and shotgun.(END OF SPOILERS)
FINAL VERDICT:  I would recommend viewing the first Evil Dead over this sequel. I thought it was very creepy and even had funnier moments than the sequel.",Null,1,1,18 September 2002
Law Abiding Citizen," Gerard Butler: a very smart killing machine
","This was one of the better films I've seen in a while. It begins with Gerard, playing Clyde, an average family man. His home is invaded and his wife and daughter are killed. Jamie Fox plays the prosecuting attorney, Nick. The robber, Darby, whom did the killings testifies against the other guy. Darby gets a light sentence, while the other guy gets lethal injection. Clyde is very upset the one who did the killing got away.Jump 10 years ahead and the execution is taking place. Something goes wrong with the lethal injection and investigation begins. Soon they are after Darby, but Darby is a set up. Clyde has vengeance on his mind and takes care of Darby in a very gruesome manner. We now know Clyde is more than an average man. The rest of the movie is a game he plays with Nick. How is he still doing the killing while in jail? And the answer to the whole thing was a really good twist I didn't see coming.FINAL VERDICT: Check it out but don't read any spoilers beforehand.",8,0,1,12 July 2010
Up in the Air," not sure what the point was
","Very little happens in this movie. It's about Ryan, played by George Clooney, whose job is to fire people. He flies around the US firing people. He meets up with this pretty woman, Alex, whom also flies a lot for her job. So they start meeting up and texting and start a little romance. Meanwhile, Ryan's company hires a young gun, Natalie, whom suggests to save money by firing people over the computer. The boss tells her to go with Ryan to see what's it like to fire people. Along the way her relationship breaks up and she sees it is not as easy as she thought. Ryan invites Alex to a wedding, and comes to think he wants what Natalie's been talking about with marriage and someone to come home to. So he goes to see Alex in Chicago and sees what he should have suspected along. And the ending is just Ryan along and flying again because his company shelved the computer idea.And how they made a movie out of that I don't know because it's hardly a plot.FINAL VERDICT: Boring, avoid.",4,8,14,29 September 2010
Atonement," I didn't think it deserved any award nominations
","I'm not sure why this movie got such high critical acclaim. I didn't think it was that good. First, it's one of those movies that skips around the timeline, which I don't particularly like. It starts to become confusing. Just show the film in time order. Also, the actors talk so fast, I could only understand what they said by turning on the closed caption. Basically, the movie centers on a lie told by a young girl, Briony. Briony sees her older sister and the house keeper's son near a fountain and gets the wrong impression. Then there is a mix up in letters and Briony reads the one she shouldn't. Next she catches her sister and Robbie in an intimate moment in the library. I think she is sort of jealous because she likes Robbie too and also thinks he is a perv. The twins run away and everyone goes outside and looks for them. Briony comes across her underage cousin with a guy in the woods. Her cousin claims she doesn't know who the man was. Briony didn't really get a good look, but assumes it must be Robbie and swears to it. She lies be saying she saw his face when she really didn't. This causes her sister and Robbie to live in misery. Robbie goes to jail and her sister can't forgive her. At the end we learn what happened to Cee and Robbie, and Briony does the only thing she knows to do to atone for her mistake.The surprise ending was nothing earth shattering. The movie was just too long and it just didn't capture my attention.FINAL VERDICT: Just OK. I sure don't think it was worthy of Oscar nominations.",5,1,4,15 October 2008
V for Vendetta," makes you think,,,
","but still was V supposed to have superhuman powers. My view is, was V supposed to be a super hero or an average joe. He gets shot at and survives. Can knock down doors with no problems. Can sling knives with ease. We see him in flashbacks walking through fire and he survived some kind of experimental testing with a virus. So, did the virus testing make him have super powers. It just didn't make sense in spots.Plus, why would Evie come back to V after he tortured her and kept her in a tiny dark room for months. She thanks him for that. Once again, didn't make a whole lot of sense. And I can't believe Natalie Portman shaved her head for that role. It's not like it was some kind of ground breaking performance.I thought the story trying to be told was too much for a two hour movie. It would have made a lot more sense if it was filmed as a 12 hour HBO series. Too much happens with the plot and it just gets confusing.FINAL VERDICT: I didn't think it is worth watching. The story isn't well put together.",5,2,7,6 March 2007
The Island," cool story but Michael Bay ruined the concept
","I don't know why the industry keeps letting Bay make movies filled with car chases, loud noises, and explosions. Those things are not required to make an entertaining film. A good script is what is important. And this movie does have a good setup. We are introduced to people who are told that the whole earth was contaminated and they are the survivors. They are sequestered and have 'guards' but are allowed to work, exercise, party. The one thing they have to look forward to is winning the lottery and going to the island. It doesn't take long to figure out something sinister is going on. Two 'clones' learn the truth and escape only to be relatively lost in the real world. They search for their counterpart and eventually decide to save everyone like them.I thought the story made sense. But it was filled with ridiculous car and motorcycle chases. Plenty of loud noises and explosions. All which don't add to the film. They just make it more unoriginal. There is even the silly love scene between Lincoln and Jordan. What did Jordan watch some porn while waiting for Lincoln and that's how they knew what to do? FINAL VERDICT: I recommend it. I thought it was entertaining even if silly in parts.",6,0,0,10 August 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," not that funny
","I am a fan of Will Ferrell, but I just don't think this movie is all that great. Maybe he should stick to just acting and not co-writing movie scripts. I thought the script was poor, not enough of a plot. Plus Ferrell once again plays the same goofy character in this movie. And I'm not a fan of NASCAR so that didn't do much for me.I found a few things funny, but overall it just wasn't a good comedy. Sasha Baron Cohen was probably the funniest thing in the film. He had his little boyfriend and his accent that could barely be understood.FINAL VERDICT: I would skip this Will Ferrell film. His small role in Weddingcrashers was funnier.",3,2,7,10 July 2007
Semi-Pro," Will Ferrell really misses the head of the nail with this film
","This has got to be one of Will Ferrell's worst films. It was just awful. Blades of Glory was much better and I didn't think that was a great comedy. Ferrell plays Jackie Moon, a has been singer whom now owns a basketball team. Not only is he the owner, he is also a player and the coach. Of course, he really doesn't know much about coaching except showing his players how to dance in animal costumes. The commissioner tells them that 4 teams from the league will be added to the NBA, and Moon's Tropics aren't one of them. But Moon insists that they should play the season out and the top 4 teams get to go to the NBA. So, now there is the stereotypical 'bad news bears' team that all of a sudden starts winning and only needs one more win to reach the goal.Some jokes used are a bear fight, a hippie who wins a 10000 dollar shot but never gets paid, the alley-oop, etc.... Just not that funny.FINAL VERDICT: Don't assume this will be half descent since Ferrell stars in it. It is really a dud.",3,3,5,1 February 2009
Furious 7," all the crazy stunts were...
","just too ridiculous. Cars fly from one hotel tower to the other, cars skydiving, getting out of a bus just as it falls over a cliff, hanging onto the windowshield of a speeding car. All nonsense. In this version, Dom is after bad guy Jason Statham whom wants revenge and this terrorist that wants a computer hacker. They save the hacker, which you guessed it(is a hot girl). And Statham just shows up at the most inopportune times. And at the end, the Rock flexes his muscles and literally breaks his arm cast off and helps save the day.FINAL VERDICT: I can't believe people pay to see this in the theater. All the stunts, cars flying in the air, and a repeated plot. Not worth paying over $2 to see.",5,2,18,17 February 2016
