Scarface," Say Hello to My Little Friend (No Spoilers)
","I've always been told this was an important film for Pacino (even though I still think it was the Godfather Trilogy that set him up for most of his future roles) and was finally able to watch it all the way through. A modern-day morality tale based on real issues from the overlapping 1980s crises. In many ways it picks up on a storyline that the Godfather Trilogy was poking at repeatedly. An interesting appearance by Michelle Pfeiffer, who is normally the OCD/peppy/creative lead in the movies in which she plays a more prominent role. It's interesting to see where Pacino's character (Tony) feels he should draw the line in terms of moral behavior. If you haven't seen the film yet, be ready for a few surprises, and the zillion scenes involving pools (no spoilers), but there are also a few predictable parts in my opinion (again, no spoilers).",7,0,1,2 September 2018
Darkest Hour," Ugh... (No Spoilers)
","I was SO READY to LOVE this movie! Churchill? Love him. Oldman? Love him. James? Love her. Each gets one star.Ready? Set? Zzzzzzzzzz.Aside from the occasional bursts from Parliament (which we know from the history books) and the occasional joke shared between Oldman and one of the other characters, the film is completely unremarkable. I've never been so disappointed by any other rendition of this historical tale. The film is boring and flat. I tried to watch it through on three separate occasions in the theatre -- the last mid-day and after substantial amounts of coffee, which finally allowed me to get through it. Skipping past any small blunders in the historical details, and with no visible 'crackle' between Churchill and Eden (I mean COME ON! that at least should have been properly managed) the focus is on the one expression, 'bugger on,' and portrays a cantankerous and inept PM. Will the movie be nominated for awards? Probably so... I mean, come on, look at the cast. Should it be? No.If you're suffering from insomnia, put down the nightcap and go watch this film.",3,65,132,7 January 2018
The Other Boleyn Girl," American Yankees in King Henry's Court (No Spoilers)
","No offense to Natalie Portman (Anne Boleyn) or Scarlett Johansson (Mary Boleyn), but having them cast in this film makes a grand mockery of the story in question. Is it possible that the director and producers were unable to find viable candidates from the vast selection of British actresses to play the leads for this film? Quite unbelievable.The Costuming was on point, as were the sets, but the casting was off, especially given the vast number of really well-developed films about Liz I.",4,1,2,25 December 2018
"I, Tonya"," MeToo: Too Little Too Late (No Spoilers)
","The infamous story about the Tonya Harding story encouraged by the sect of adoring Oprah fans backing the 'MeToo'/'TimesUp' initiatives that are more propaganda than action. The film provides the back story of abuse and suffering that the famous olympic skater apparently had to endure, with strong shaming to those who tried to give her honest feedback about the industry (and the expectations) as well as those who took part in the public hatred she faced following the incident with fellow-skater Nancy Kerrigan. The film comes too late in the sense that mainstream movie goers don't necessarily recall (or care) about this story any more. In the eyes of the media, justice was served and the injured skater was able to recover to some degree. It dishes the guilt out to everyone, globally, with the implication that Tonya is the product of her environment, pushed down by too many. While this may be true, and while I personal feel sympathy for her childhood back story (no spoilers), as an adult her choices were hers to make (no spoilers).It's interesting to see who the movie industry now chooses to celebrate.",3,3,6,18 February 2018
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Better now that the sequel is out (No Spoilers)
","The first time around this is seemingly the worst of the J.K. Rowling films, however after seeing Fantastic Beasts II (Crimes of Grindelwald), where she connects the dots between Fantastic Beasts I and Harry Potter VI this becomes a much more interesting film. As was the case with HP VI, however, these could have easily been made into one film rather than dragging HP fans along for the profit. We know that J.K. Rowling was basically homeless when she suddenly hit it big -- and that Johnny Depp is now basically destitute and suing his managers for gross misappropriation of funds -- but that doesn't mean that the team should make sincere HP fans destitute by dragging the story out. It's a greedy little venture we're watching unfold.",4,1,3,17 November 2018
Dirty Dancing," Memorable Retro (No Spoilers)
",The dance scenes in this film have always been pretty memorable -- probably the Swayze factor imo. The constant reminder of the social divide between 'the guests' and 'the help' pushed throughout the film (no spoilers) was a major topic back in the '80s as women were really working hard to break through the glass ceiling both socially and professionally. The film seems to be making a comeback now as the opening film to an DVD double-feature with 'The Help'.,6,1,1,2 September 2018
Aladdin," From Robin Williams to Will Smith? Wowzers! Lightening Struck Twice
","HIGHLY RECOMMENDING this film. The only person who could do justice to Robin Williams as Alladin (RIP) is definitely Will Smith. What a lovely tribute. Cast, sets and costuming - not to mention the remarkable musical scores -- are absolutely amazing. No spoilers, but obviously the plot follows that of the original animation (with a few cute twists).",10,4,9,17 June 2019
The Theory of Everything," Amazing and Inspiring (No Spoilers)
","For those who aren't familiar with the inspiring real-life story of Stephen Hawking (RIP 2018), take a look at his biographical site. This is a person who defied all manner of calculations in work and in life, doing things that no one thought was possible based on the known restrictions of his diagnosed disease, ALS.The movie is very touching and true to the real life story, very worthy of the many awards and nominations. We need more films like this one. Bravo!",10,0,1,25 December 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Oh my...
","Going to see this film was part of a birthday gift. (I want a birthday do-over.) When one of my nephews heard we were all going to see it he gracefully sidestepped the invitation saying he had trig homework to do. HE is the family movie buff, so that was a major red flag. When another family member asked what the movie was about as we filed in with popcorn, etc., we joked that the subplot was to help fund Depp's recovery from his latest behind-the-scenes relationship woes (not knowing yet how awful and lifeless the film actually would be). It's no secret that there's no real plot or acting involved in this (final?) part to the series. I'm amazed they were able to get any of the stellar cast members from the series back. I liked the earlier ones. This... didn't do anything for me. People were actually walking out of the theatre.",1,51,93,27 May 2017
Hidden Figures," Best movie of 2016 (No Spoilers)
","This tied with one other 2016 film for 'Best Movie' in my book. A surprising performance by Costner -- he finally 'does it' for me in this film -- but the three co-stars took my breath away. Spencer I know and always watch no matter what the movie is, and her story as well as Monae's really point to major issues that specifically targeted African American women trying to establish themselves in the professional arena. (Separately, you clearly see the women in engineering issues, but women of color were historically known to have the hardest struggle in the US.) Henson's performance just made me want to hug her. Amazing job. (I can't even tell you my favorite part because it will be a spoiler, but it's one of the scenes with her and Costner.)My women's group has the DVD in our library and we've all really enjoyed it. Highly recommended.",10,0,7,25 June 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Mixed Tape (No Spoilers)
","Good plot development, but the visual effects weren't up to par with Vol. 1; not sure if that was accidental. I don't want to name specific effects and spoil anything. On the positive side, costuming was decent, timing/delivery was great and the soundtrack is fun. Groot is STILL the coolest. Between him, Pratt, Cooper AND Russell its eye candy for every generation.u",7,2,6,28 May 2017
Wonder Woman," Wonder... (No Spoilers)
","Gal Gadot was an interesting choice for the part. Not exactly what I would envision aesthetically as the ideal choice for the part, but she's a good enough contrast to the seemingly clueless male co-stars. The beginning of the movie is quite lovely. Kudos to those responsible for picking out all the amazing backdrops, which distract you from the twisted plot. Great casting for Queen Hippolyta and Thia Eva (the Amazonian general), but some of the other Amazonians were also a bit much. They're stronger and more physically adept than any other women in the world. We get it.I'm not a fan of everyone's treatment of Diana in general. Without offering any serious spoilers, her character is always viewed as 'distracting' at various levels both on and off the island. The only way she gets attention is by being 'loud Greek girl' or just ignoring everyone and jumping into the fray without a clue. The greatest possible weapon she could have -- full disclosure of who and what she really is -- is never offered to her. In truth, the back story of why she exists is a huge departure from the comic tale AND also an insult to the Amazonian myth that is being used as the backdrop of the story. Did Disney buy out DC Comics too?Chris Pine is eye candy, as always, but the constant references to how spectacular a physical specimen he is (as part of countless plots in ALL his films) is getting old. Is it something he insists on having his his contracts? If not, it's too Tom Jones. Give him a new line, someone. PLEASE. He's actually a good actor otherwise.Next, the only characters throughout the movie who have a positive view of strong/intellectual women are highlighted as 'the bad guys' in major ways, which was very upsetting.In short, it's not a proper Wonder Woman film and goes against the most fundamental precepts behind the creation of the character.There ARE some humorous moments in the movie, including some of Diana's cluelessness about men and the modern world, but the joke is taken a little too far.One of the funniest scenes is actually when she's dead serious and clad in blue. No spoilers, but she reminded me of every Greek mom I know in that one moment. Well done, Gadot.",3,2,10,25 June 2017
Black Panther," Old & New (No Spoilers)
","The classic Black Panther story returns, with the new edge in terms of tech and talent (no spoilers). The original storyline leaves substantial room for strong female characters -- and we have the amazing Angela Basset at the helm for this. The entire cast does a really amazing job and the special effects are exceptional. Points off for the execution of the multiple spirit world scenes, which could have been much less 'Lion King,' especially given the amazing job done in the rest of the film. Despite this, the movie ranks highly for me as a great action-adventure film for the whole family.",9,4,20,18 February 2018
The Greatest Showman," Circus of Life (No Spoilers)
","Jackman brings his A game to this film, as does the entire cast. There's one small plot twist I wasn't a fan of (no spoilers) because it reverses the push for equality that was building up in the film, however the story is well executed and the soundtrack is remarkable. Efron is all grown up and really growing into these more intense roles. (A while ago I thought his recent B-level surfer-dude film was going to be a defining point in his career, but he shows a great deal of potential and is an ideal wingman to Jackman.)",8,2,5,18 February 2018
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Remarkable Rendition of a Historical Icon (No Spoilers)
","An Icon of her time, Elizabeth I is an inspiring muse for many dramatists then and now; she's also a socio-political anomaly of sorts, having baffled countless advisors as her father once did. The film does a great job depicting the internal and external conflicts the young queen faced. The Tudor line may have ended with her, but her life and reign marks one of the greatest points in British (and feminist) history.Amazing sets and costuming and an astounding cast. The film's perspective is simple in some ways, but cuts through to the heart of the solitary queen who captured the hearts of her people. Bravo!",8,0,0,25 December 2018
