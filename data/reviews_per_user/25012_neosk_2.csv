Sucker Punch," crazy
","Honestly, I don't know what stuff the director/writer/whoever in the team took, but it really had to be some seriously wicked stuff. I saw something from 'Inception' (we need to go DEEPER in the fantasies), some kind of Rambo movie with anime feeling in it and a little bit of soft erotic(?) stuff. I face palmed more than a dozen times during this endless train of pain. I mean ... few girls staring at a zippo lighter, like they never seen such a thing before? Whole setting is just wrong and honestly, the heroine couldn't deserve less than a lobotomy for being so much retarded.Then I think the director went by the motto 'sex sells', because really the girls in there were hot. And that's like all it got to it.giving it a really *solid* three for the fancy effects (ok, hats down, those were amazing, some of the stills worth a wallpaper picture :D ), but that's like all",3,2,7,7 July 2011
Burlesque," bit above average movie, fitting songs
","OK, first of all - I don't get how people compare this to a 30's movie or whatever.I didn't like Christina before much. I just didn't like her outfit along with the 'pop-ish' music she made. Neither I did Cher.But hell, when Christina opened up her mouth on the stage for Tough Lover I got thrilled. The sing performances are simply amazing and show the vocal qualities of both singers. Honestly, I can't stop listening to the soundtrack. The arrangements of the songs within the movie are amazing as well, incomparable to those in 'Step Up' series.But sadly besides that, the screenplay is typically Hollywood - I knew how the movie was going to end since beginning. Shallow story and I really lol'd when Cher was singing her 2nd song in the movie... Just came along to the empty club, where the most probably loyal sound guy was waiting for her to rehearse something. And she sang something about something and then she went off. I was like: 'wow great singing, but ... where does it fit the context?' I give it a 7 just because I enjoyed the songs and voice along with arrangements.",7,5,6,20 March 2011
