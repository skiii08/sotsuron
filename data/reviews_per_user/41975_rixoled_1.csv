Hereditary," Snoring at the Movies
","I went into this movie excited, ready for a thrilling horror movie. From the first day I seen the trailer I was so happy I'd get to see a movie that'd scare me, even if a bit. Alas my dream began to shatter more and more as the movie crawled along, and how I wish some horrible creature would be crawling along in it. The theater had roughly 20-25 people in it when the film started, by half way point maybe 15-20 remained, including me. I will be honest, if you want a horror movie, look elsewhere. If you're after those thrills, you'll find more thrill on a kids roller coaster at most theme parks. Acting was good, plot was poor at best and it wanted to honestly be more than it was. It was hyped up much more than it was, and the hype was all it had going for it. My friend sitting next to me, fell asleep and people left before half the movie was over out of boredom. Thats enough to tell you to avoid the movie, yet if you want to be bored then hey enjoy the show.",1,25,63,9 June 2018
