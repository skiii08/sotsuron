Requiem for a Dream," The cruel life with dependency
","I think the destiny let me watch that movie. I have seen another movie of the same director, I was impressed of it, I saw also, here in Imdb, that Requiem for a dream was appreciated by users and somebody else told me many good things about it, so I wanted to watch it, but it was not easy to be found. Very strangely, once, I read the program of a satellite tv channel never watched and (surprise) Requiem for a dream was there that night. The expectations have not been disappointed, it is a great movie. At the beginning you don't feel too much, everything seems normal (to be a movie). Step by step it let you feel the same emotions of characters, every one, and unfortunately they are bad emotions. After having watched this movie you feel very bad, something remain in you stomach, it is incredible. The director is able to let you enter in the mentality of a disturbed mind, disturbed by drugs, but it could be anything else that give dependency. Everything is secondary, dignity, family, love and life as well, to find what they need is the priority. Wonderful use of music, it interpret the anguish of imagines. The director is incredible using imagines mixed quickly, to make credible the dream-reality mix created in character's minds. If you haven't watched it yet do it, but don't go to bed just after, it will be difficult to sleep, you should watch another movie or go outside thinking something else. It is a straordinary movie, It have to be seen, it is a good example of the art of cinema.",10,0,1,22 March 2004
Being John Malkovich," A curious movie
","Many friends of mine suggested to watch it, unfortunately I succeeded to do it very late and I am sorry because it is a very good movie. It is something new, good idea, nice story, completely different from usual targets. It could be seen as a poem, it is quite unreal, but it let us feel a nice dream. The story is a piece of geniality and cinema needed it. I don't want to describe scenes or to say the plot, I want just to offer the possibility to anyone who didn't watch it to do it as soon as possible. Malkovich is one of my favourite actor and here is brilliant also because he take joke of himself. Good interpretation from John Cusack, while a surprise could be Cameron Diaz, but who watched `Last supper' can understand that sometimes (rarely) she can take part of a well done movie. Sorry for my English! I'll be better in next",10,0,1,31 January 2004
The Machinist," Dostoyevsky and Italian title
","I totally agree with who noticed big inspirations to Dostoyevsky's books. I just read one of them, the double, but I studied about the others. Watching the movie it came to my mind immediately, I liked that book! Anyway, it is usually a trouble for a movie to be inspired from a book, more if it is transported to a modern period, it is impossible to be compared to a good book you loose, but here no risk has be paid, it just use the idea of 'some' books of the same author and play a story a part, so it doesn't need to be compared, well done. I am disappointed indeed with the Italian title. The translation of 'l'uomo senza sonno' is something like 'the man who doesn't sleep'. OK, he really doesn't sleep since one year but in my opinion it didn't get the point, it has a secondary role, I don't know how to explain, ti is just a consequence. I mean, if the director have chosen this title is OK (i.e. Insomnia), but he chose another one so I don't understand why to change it. I know that everybody say that and that it is obvious, but Bale was incredibly skinny, I don't know how is possible. Kilos a part his interpretation was really good. To me, the problem of this movie is that was not long enough. It could seems a no sense, usually there is the contrary problem. I think that a longer movie give the possibility to remark a stronger anguish. I just 'feel' it sometimes, and when pathos is growing it is going to be concluded. Maybe I am masochist, but I have preferred to feel anguish more.",7,1,1,14 June 2005
The Butterfly Effect," Possible good plot.......destroyed!
","It's a pity, I still ask me how is it possible to waste such a brilliant idea. From the beginning, the plot catch you, it seems twisted (it is), but easy to understand, and it is effective. Going on it fall into the banality, always worse going to the end. It seems like they had this starting idea, but they were not able to evolve it for the rest of the movie, so it remain as an embryo. It become obvious and often pathetic. The only message escapes is the classic and obvious:'if you want to change the future it could be worse'. Another problem: actors! Incredibly not able to act, Kutcher (I don't know if famous in the States) is not 'strong' enough to have such a responsibility, Amy Smart is beauty, but just that, Melora Walters is always crying, very far from the good interpretations with P.T.Andersson. Somebody compare it to 'Donnie Darko'. No way! Another World!",5,36,60,19 February 2005
