Insidious: Chapter 2," Scare-less but syncs in with the first!
","Horror as a genre, often ends up not keeping the promises they make. While there are classics and modern flicks that scares the bejesus outta you, there are also those which doesn't always click. And I can mention a lot more of those than the ones that's actually scary. Then there are of course horror movies that actually work for one and not the other coz, I believe, we all have varied scare-tolerances. I for myself can handle 'gore' like piece of cake but can't stand twitchy supernatural beings. Frankly, the found footage horror movies has ruined the genre to some degree. How many Paranormal Activity sequels can you watch until you get bored of scaring yourself with flying frying pans. When the said genre was imbued with those horror movie dingus, James Wan, went the old school way with 2010′s Insidious. Insidious had everything in store for horror fanatics. It was atmospheric and Wan not resorting to monster closets and cliché's were a welcome change. While the movie did have its flaws, it still stood out among the hosh-posh horror movies. I have fond memories of watching Insidious at the dead of the night with my headphones on and boy, I was freaked outta my wits, at least for the first two acts. Agreed James Wan is a man of many talents, having directed blockbusters in almost every genre as evident from movies like Saw and Insidious to Death Sentence and the upcoming Fast & Furious 7 but when it came to The Conjuring I could agree less with the majority who praised it sky high. The Conjuring was a well directed piece, adorned with brilliant performances but it was anything but scary.Insidious Chapter 2 starts off where the first left off. The Lambert family was still not completely clear of the malice from part one and without spoiling much its assured that there was plenty much more in store for them. While Insidious was all about astral projections, this ones more about the ones that passed through the portal. Initially it was all but slow, but when it got to the second act it got more interesting at the cost of dropping the atmospheric quality the first had. There was a huge tonal shift. The movie took a fine take at continuing the Insidious myth and seamlessly ties in with the first's story filling whatever gaping holes it had. If you wanna be in sync with whats happening in Chapter 2 you ought watch Chapter one. Watching Insidious is mandatory, nuff said. But scares-wise the movie lacked, almost as much as The Conjuring. And it also had some odd comedy injected. For a story arc that was so serious, the comedy felt distracting. The performances of the cast were splendid, especially of Rose Bryne as Renai Lambert, her helplessness was direly felt. Patrick Wilson's characters were also noteworthy and you'll know why I mentioned 'characters' when you watch it. Lin Shaye's Elise was a remarkable performance as well.Ending on an ambiguous note, Insidious Chapter 2 leaves a lot of scope for sequels. For one, I really missed the Red-face demon from the first, who was nowhere to be seen or heard in Chapter 2. James Wan made 2 horror movies this year, The Conjuring was a fairly entertaining movie (had it not been so hyped) and in Insidious Chapter 2, he was not reluctant to play with its myth expanding its own universe. I cant wait to see what he's going to do with the now-humdrum Fast & Furious franchise next year.",6,0,0,24 December 2013
Skyfall," The Best thing to happen to James Bond!
","Skyfall was the single most anticipated movie after the Goliath that released in July. James Bond movies have always captured a huge audience in-spite of age, sex and whatnot. Directed by Sam Mendes, I was curious enough to see how 'Revolutionary Road' helmer would craft the 23rd James Bond movie. A lot has been left in his hands and it really has to be a milestone especially when they are celebrating '50 Years of James Bond'.Following a thick action sequence I was greeted to an awe-inspiring title sequence with mind-bending-cryptic-visuals accompanied by Adele's epic 'Let the sky fall' track, it was a sure sign that Skyfall would blow your mind. Daniel Craig returns, once again as 007 and there's just too many words to describe him though for one I'd say 'Unstoppable'. Daniel as 007 was introduced as a welcome change from the James Bonds we've seen previously. He was molded through the worst like we've witnessed in Casino Royale and Quantum Of Solace. Craig's James Bond always felt tough as nails yet slightly disturbed inside and even his stance felt ready to pounce, hasty in decision making that actually made way for some of the best action sequences ever. I just couldn't digest this guy once played a sidekick to Angelina Jolie's Tomb Raider. I realized that Naomi Harris doesn't have that essential oomph factor that Bond girls usually gets drenched in. And on the other hand Berenice Marlohe did have her screen time and did really well. The real Bond girl in Skyfall is without doubt, Judie Dench once again reprising her role as M. Despite everything that has happened since Casino Royale, M was the one person whom James Bond was close with and the director really pulls some strings to get the best outta them. Ben Whishaw, after his awesome performance in 'Cloud Atlas' takes on the role as Q. He made a remarkable use of his limited screen time striking both charm and drollery.Its only close to the 2nd act that we see the who'd blow your mind (no puns intended). Till now we've been introduced to only pansy foes against Bond. And its a shame given Craig's bond is so inured and isn't given a proper villain to test everything he's got. Be it Casino Royale's 'Le Chiffre' or Quantum's 'Dominic Greene', neither of em had what it takes to be true Bond villain. Enter Skyfall's Silva, a solid and finally intimidating villain for James Bond played none other than Javier Bardem. If Bond was Batman, Silva would be Joker, oozing both brain and brawn this guy is a force to reckon with and comes off as a laudable supervillain in the Bond reboot.As a James Bond fan (Who isn't?) I was well received I should say. Bond ain't formulaic anymore. At least till the last decade Bond movies were so formulaic – all thanks to the cheesiest Bond ever, Pearce Brosnan, a supervillain, 2 girls one of which would turn out to be a bitch and killed off leading to an Brobdingnagian-finale. However Skyfall is the best thing that has happened to James Bond since the Casino Royale reboot. Up until the 2nd act Skyfall played the usual James Bond fare, but it was whole new ball game after that. Action-enthusiasts and not alike will like what's in store for you in the second half. At times I was left asking myself 'Am I really watching a James Bond movie?' (in a good way of course). Thomas Newman's score was pure bliss promising espionage themes at its best. There are some great homages as well that'll please some Sean Connery fans.Skyfall is for everybody, people who thought James Bond was over-rated and people who idolize him as Ian Flemming's iconic Agent 007. Yes I do question the liberties it has taken to revamp it but it was enjoyable nonetheless. This is Bond like you've never seen before and yes, 'James Bond will Return'. The apple has fallen from the tree though not so far to not be relished.",8,1,8,14 December 2012
Gravity," Np space movie will ever be the same!
","What is cinema? Its the perfect blend of sights and sounds that should stir your audio visual sensory and in the process entertain you. Even if its got a paperthin plot, amazing performances and the right setting and score can create wonders for the audience. Its also a medium with which we should be able to live out our fantasies. Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity fulfills everything a movie should do. Forget deep space battles and X- Wings or the Enterprise swishing past by (if possible), forget Xenomorphs and LV 223. This is real life and it is at its best here.Gravity opens with a shot of earth from space, it panned for some seconds and I was left skeptic, questioning if the whole movie would be so. Images struck me from 2001 A Space Odyssey and while 2001 was never EVER a bad movie, I didn't pay to watch it once again. My misconceptions were raked, minutes into the movie when George Clooney and Sandra Bullock's characters came into view, chattering, fixing stuff on a space satellite. A few more minutes in, they were left stranded in space with nothing but their wits and spacesuits with depleting oxygen. Our protagonists from there on takes us on a bonafide roller-coaster ride through space ensuing chaos & thrills enough to make you feel the usually-harmless-intermission-to-empty-your-bladders, intrusive!Alfonso Cuaron has created a flawless masterpiece here. Gravity will dumbfound you to levels beyond that you will even forget that you are watching a movie. There were times where I forgot to breath like many in the audience. You feel you are inside the protagonists spacesuit and believe me the beautiful world will immerse you, not having to think twice that you are watching a movie. On a surface its a survivalist movie, but under the surface it has complex levels of philosophical goodness. There was this particular scene where Ryan Stone takes on a foetal position as soon as she gets inside a space stationsimply awesome. Alfonso Cuaron, as evident from Children of Men, is a director with a panache for rich visuals and simultaneously telling a gripping story and the same can be seen here in Gravity. The plot isn't much to brag about but it wonderfully adheres to the visuals, promising a journey you are not likely to forget anytime soon.Had the actors weren't of caliber, it could have gone utterly wrong, considering you have barely 3 actors the whole of Gravity. But when you've got Sandra Bullock and George Clooney in the lead, you can set aside whatever ill notions you've got. It could be considered a female- centric movie and Sandra Bullock as Ryan Stone leaves no space for disappointment. I wouldn't be surprised if she ends up with an Academy Award (let alone for the movie or the visual effects). George Clooney, as usual, brings the charisma and charm, the wisdom as well as dalliance to Gravity.The visual effects are stunning and beyond words. For someone who's never been to space, Gravity was as authentic an experience that I could have had and I am exceedingly pleased with it. This is the kinda movie, theatres are made for. I watched it at the IMAX and I was sucked into the 'out of the world' experience. The visuals rich, advanced and said to be engineered just for the movie, it was an orgasmic sight to behold. For a movie which is stripped much off its sounds, the score comes into play less often as expected but when it does, it does make for a terrifically tense experience. Two thumbs up for Steven Price's captivating score.I can't recommend Gravity enough. Watching this on a small screen will never do justice to the efforts the cast and crew has put in the movie but more than that its a definitive experience of space travel. Why would you want to shell out millions (like thats possible) when the same could be experienced with a few bucks? That could be a implausible question but its as close we can get to space travel (And frankly this movie has made me astrophobic). One of the best movies of the year and worth every penny spent on the IMAX experience.",8,2,5,24 December 2013
This Is the End," A hilarious END indeed!
","Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen strikes an almost perfect comic note with This is The End. Its studded with characters playing their exaggerated selves. So Seth Rogen is the same guy in every one of his movies, Danny McBride is jerkier than ever, James Franco is still stuck with memories from Pineapple Express and still thinks he's besties with Seth, and the recently Academy Award nominated Jonah Hill is trying hard to be the nicest guy ever.As mentioned above its an almost perfect stoner movie. This is The End is exactly what you'd expect when Seth Rogen teams up with Evan Goldberg. Its raunchy, juvenile and situational. This is a movie where you'd want to appreciate the idiocy and callowness of 30 year olds running around during a weird scenario. Our protagonists, Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson and Danny McBride finds themselves stuck at James Francos house when all hell breaks loose outside and the forthcoming events are nothing short of uproarious. I am sure the cast had a splendid time shooting and the enthusiasm could be felt. The same could be said about Seth and Evan directing them, they did have a blast and it could be seen on screen. The utter stupidity that's smeared through to the end had me in splits. Where in some movies the stars might have emerged as legendary heroes saving the day, you snigger at protagonists' sheer helplessness here instead.There are many scenes where you think the cast was just ad-libbing but you can't help but chuckle at them coz it felt like they were having a natural argument or conversation like they would in real life. Like those repulsively hilarious argument between James Franco and Danny McBride about the cum on a porn magazine. Having played their own exaggerated counterparts, the actors got a real chance at making fun of their own movies. There were loads of references to other movies that as soon as I finished watching it I had an immense craving to watch Pineapple Express and Superbad again, thanks to the mock-sequel that was played in-movie. And then there were the cameos, its just stupendously hilarious how each of them turned out to be.Post the 2nd act it takes on a dark shade but they even managed to make a poke fun at it making way for more laughs. And when you thought it was losing steam, it quickly picks up the pace ensuring even more entertainment. Had those scenes been a bit trimmed, it would have been perfect. I was also a bit put off with the excessive bromance.We're are not unacquainted with movies like this, we'd previously got Shaun of The Dead and Zombieland sharing the same genre. In an industry populated by endless stoner and apocalypse movies This is The End stands out. It carves a niche of its own, inducing a kind of natural comedy into scenarios like this. Much like the ad-libbing cast, This is The End is unpredictable, ridiculously dirty and prodigiously hilarious. Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen has indeed hit pure comedy gold with This is The End.",7,0,5,24 December 2013
World War Z," Surprisingly Entertaining!
","World War Z is a movie based on Max Brooks book by the same name and the similarities ends there. Having read halfway through the book, the movie is nothing like its book counterpart. For long World War Z was said to be in production hell having issues with directors and budget and naturally I was skeptical about it. Brad Pitt was announced to be the lead but it never came off as a consolation. Marc Forster as a director made it worse for me to accept it. No offence but Quantum Of Solace wasn't a gem of a James Bond movie. I was genuinely concerned as I was a zombie genre fan first and foremost, and wanted it to work out well.I was surprised when I read on IGN that World War Z was not a complete let down. Believe me I had not kept my hopes high for this one so a news like this did revive my hopes for the same.World War Z starts off with Brad Pitt's character Gerry Lane, a former UN personnel stuck in traffic with his family. And without a moment to spare, all hell breaks loose from there. Gerry and his family is put in the midst of the zombie outbreak and along with it, so are you. The first hour or so Gerry is hellbent on taking his family to safety and with his contacts at the UN he does accomplish it but in return he is sent to investigate the source of this zombie outbreak and he goes off on his mission moving from location to another in search of a possible cure.We, as an audience, are just dropped into midst of the ruckus in like 10 minutes. There wasn't much time for character development. Of course horror movies never demand character development but this is not your usual horror flick where characters are used as cannon fodder. In, World War Z, the only character you end up caring about is Gerry and thats about it. Although he has his heart with his family tucked away far from the zombie outbreak, you just don't feel the same. World War Z works out very much like a disaster movie. Think 2012, think The Day After Tomorrow. WWZ plays out exactly so, where instead of natural calamities you have a zombie apocalypse to deal with. It wasn't the zombies thats of interest here, it was the setting which was direly grim. It reminded me a lot of Contagion. That being said this is not the movie for hardcore horror fans and for those who go in expecting to see brain- eating zombies or gore would be disappointed sorely. Its more drama than horror. Then again this ain't a rehashed 28 Days Later. Where 28 Days Later had a solid storyline WWZ falters there a bitthe story of the movie could be encompassed in one paragraph but that owes to the fast pace that it'd got too. Tense moments were aplenty and yes the first as well as the second half of movie does put you at the edge of the your seats. I was never given a moment to breathe. I was either taking deep breaths or keeping my breath in at times of those tense moments. The 12 second zombie-bite-turnover time was what made it tense most of the times. There was this scene where Brad runs to the edge of a building, away from his family, having had zombie brain matter in his mouth and counting to 12 to see if he'd turnit striked to me as ingenious writing. My problem was that it was all too fast. If you watch it individually and as snippets its quite gripping but the team globetrotting their way to find the source of the outbreak felt way too quickWAAAY TOO QUICK! I know my statements could contradict here but this is exactly how I felt.Brad Pitt was awesome as Gerry. The film was solely on Brad Pitt's shoulders and he's put in his best here. A bit of credit could be given to Mireille Enos, she didn't have a lot to do here but she was convincing as Karin Lane. Apart from these two, the only cast members worth mentioning are Daniella Kertesz and Pierfrancesco Favino/Peter Capaldi duo each having the shortest of screentimes ever.Qualms regarding the ending was inevitable. The finale felt very unsatisfactory. The right word would be 'precipitous'. Everything that had it going for the movie was put to an abrupt end. PG 13 hampers the experience a bit. But not completely; all the slashing/hitting and the gore that followed, they were all implied and it makes for some effective scenes as well. the The second half didn't come up to its first counterpart and had serious issues with the pacing, where the first half screamed urgency the second half was more akin to playing a stealth game, taking its sweet time to keeping you in strain.World War Z is good movie but far from perfection. But of course you have to give in to the makers for coming up with something as entertaining as this despite going through the worst of production. It also has an intense score composed by Marco Beltrami. PS: Watch this movie in 2D.",7,1,2,24 December 2013
Don Jon," JGL's debut feature is one to remember!
","Don Jon was one of the movies I'd been looking forward to this year. The reasons, obvious: Its written and directed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the previews were good and Scarlett Johansson looked insanely hot in it. Don Jon deals with porn addiction and in essence, I felt, it largely a movie for the masculine crowd. Take it or leave it. But that's not to say the feminine mass can't enjoy it, for starters it stars JGL.Jon Martello, played by JGL himself, is a pornography addict and its his quirks, awkward moments and the addiction that makes the movie. Don Jon has a lot of little things that adheres to your viewing pleasure. And no it's not the titillating scenes that I'm taking about. It's the little things that makes a good movie, scenes that bring a smile on your face, a chuckle every now and then. The subject matter of porn could have easily slid into being crude but thanks to JGL's skilled direction, its never crossed the offensive line and instead it took a lighter and a more stylish path. JGL's direction instills comedy and immense awkwardness in Don Jon. And unlike Steve McQueen's Shame it steers clear of drama and serious notes up until its final act.JGL packs an infinite charm and confidence here. It felt like he's finally broken out of his boyish molds. Well we did get a sample in Killshot's Richie Nix but here he just puts it all upfront with his convincing Italian accent and all. Scarlett Johansson was just as brilliant and again not coz she's hot. Well she is, but the way she talked, the way she delivered her lines, its impeccable acting prowess. Her accent, which initially put me off, came with her character and she did a grand job. Its one of her finest roles ever, outside Woody Allen movies.The supporting cast was splendid as well. I wondered what Brie Larson had been doing playing Jon's texting-obsessed sister who barely had anything to do or say and there were times when I felt her character was just there for the sake of it, under developedbut towards the final act it changed, in an instant! Tony Danza, despite his limited screen time, shared an immaculate chemistry with JGL.The movie is what I'd call slick, at least the first two acts. The visuals had a lot of editing done to, that added to the visual flair. And add to that an awesome soundtrack, Don Jon becomes a stellar treat. Who wouldn't shake their heads to Marky Mark And The Funky Bunch's Good Vibrations?Don Jon ain't without its flaws though. I couldn't buy into the events that redeems him towards the end. The scope of the story could have much more but I guess keeping it short worked best. Julianne Moore's character could have had a bit more back story. I just didn't get what her catch was. Now lets talk about the steamy scenes, yes there are plenty but nothing to be delirious or appalled about; it just blends well with narrative.Ultimately Don Jon is a refreshing movie owing everything to its sumptuous performances, stellar cast, stunning visuals, music and was terrific for a directorial debut. It makes me wanna see more of JGL's film-making skills",7,4,5,24 December 2013
Ready Player One," pwnd
","Ready Player One directed by Steven Spielberg is based on Ernest Cline's 'Holy Grail of Pop Culture' of the same name and it rather borrows a large chunk of the concept from the book than adapt it word by word to the big screen. Having read the book it feels taboo to compare the book with the movie. My only regret is, like most book-to-movie adaptation, the movie had to be watered down to be contained into 120 minutes thereby diluting a lot of plot. Spielberg clearly has taken the creative liberty in adapting the book to a more contemporary audience. Of course, he generously pays homage to major pop culture references from the book, but he has added a lot too. Read on to find out if its worth your time, virtual or not.Set in 2045, when the world is on the brink of chaos, people are resorting to a virtual reality world called the OASIS for both work and leisure. Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan), an orphan from the desolate 'stacks', along with the whole world, is off to find an easter egg in the OASIS planted by the game's own brilliant nerd of a creator, James Halliday. Finding the egg grants the player complete ownership of the company. Wade has to figure out all the clues that Halliday has cleverly hidden in the OASIS' vast game worlds. He is also in a race against the evil corporation, IOI, run by Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelson) and is hell-bent on finding the egg making Wade's and his friend's adventure difficult.Much of the movie takes place in the OASIS and is packed to the brim with awe-inspiring visuals and nerd culture. With the amount of action happening in the OASIS it was almost impossible to track a whos-who of pop culture icons and references. From Batman to Tracer, from Akira to Halo, one thing is sure, this could be one of THE most paused movies of all time when it releases on home video. This movie could have easily been something cashing in on nostalgia and pop culture references: a la 'cameo fest', but with Spielberg at the helm, it was both a boon and a curse. As mentioned early on, Spielberg, Cline, and Penn took their liberty to adapt the movie to be a visual epic than a straightforward adaptation and it does the job rather well. The first set piece, which was a racing sequence with absolutely no musical score had 'Spielberg' written all over it. But at the same time, there were moments so unremarkable and it felt like any other AAA director could have done the same. The real world felt very underwhelming and so were the issues that IOI caused in it which were reduced to one-liner dialogues, hardly exposing any of the dire issues or the repercussions of IOI that plagued the world.Coming to performances, the lead Wade Watts aka Parzival played by Tye Sheridan was better off as an avatar. Even under Spielberg's direction, Sheridan's Off-OASIS performances were just okay. Olivia Cooke, on the other hand, was oozing charm and the right amount needed for her character as both Samantha and her OASIS avatar Art3mis. Ben Mendelson, as usual, chews the scenery. The guy proves once again why he's the go-to choice for antagonists. Mark Rylance is another actor whom I am fond of seeing on screen. Whether it be Bridge Of Spies, BFG or Dunkirk, Rylance's performance always feels natural and its no different here as both James Halliday and his avatar Anorak. Screen time for Simon Pegg's Ogden Morrow was unforgivably short.John Willam's absence was really noticeable and Alan Silvestri's score, although not bad, just didn't stick. Fortunately, the soundtrack makes up for it which starts off with the energetic 'Jump by Van Halen' and ends with the equally preppy 'You make my dreams come true by Hall & Oates'.In the end, Ready Player One is confused who it is for. If you're expecting a visually stunning action movie with a serviceable story to boot then this is definitely up your alley but if you're expecting a Spielberg directed, plot-heavy and character-driven epic, you might be disappointed.The same goes for the fanservice in the movie. Is it for the 40-year-olds who might get high with most of 80's and 90's pop culture references in the movie or for the newer generation who'd be pleased with the more recent pop culture icons they have sprinkled gratuitously. The age-old question of 'Book or Movie, which one's better?' still applies here and the answer is 'Yes, it always will be the book'. While reading the book I thought it'd be great to see it on celluloid but it's the other way around. The only thing I was able to appreciate more after watching the movie was the book itself which I found was only mediocre.",7,0,1,29 June 2018
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," You can't give this a miss!
","It has been 6 years since Iron Man hit the screens and since then Marvel Studios has been building one of the richest universes in movie history. The movies are well planned and the characters gets processed through their cycles, from cameos to full fledged roles in succeeding movies. It has worked out well for them as well as the audiences as there was not one movie unworthy of mention. They've also made it so that its impossible to skip one movie outta the franchise. While some of the standalone movies did have its flaws it was could be easily overlooked as it contributed to the Phase One finale, The Avengers. While I wasn't a huge fan of Captain America The First Avenger, I still thought it was a well made movie having done the origins story right. Obviously second to Iron Man and a notch above Thor, Captain America being set in the early 40s told the story of Steve Rogers, a petite kid to came to be the first Avenger, Captain America.Marvel had been churning out good to mediocre standalone movies for its Phase 2, be it Iron Man 3 or Thor The Dark World, it could never be considered something as brilliant as its prequels and almost felt like it was made just for the sake of it. But Captain America The Winter Soldier is by far the best standalone Marvel movie and it has definitely upped the ante. It promises a ton of action, a brilliant script and a wonderful sense of humor. Greeted to a well choreographed, action packed hostage rescue mission set on a ship, Captain America The Winter Soldier never misses a beat. Steve Rogers, himself is done with the fish outta water sequences and trying earnestly to keep up with a world 95 years from his time. He definitely misses the world he was in and it was evident from his frequent visits to the Smithsonian museum reliving his 107th Battalion days. There was this particular sequence with Peggy Carter which was a tearjerker.Captain America The Winter Soldier takes on a political thriller approach and it works so well that it carves a niche of its own in the Marvel Universe 'Good luck topping that Marvel!' The stakes are definitely high this time and the Cap is on a run, with everything including SHIELD turned against him. Exhilarating could be an understatement. The plot's got some smart twists to offer and it never goes OTT.Chris Evans has come far from his Not Another Teen Movie days and he plays Steve Rogers/Captain America with utmost sincerity, flair and a calm demeanor that it brings a quality of an unruffled leader. While he was good as the Human Torch infusing enough comedy in the role, it seems the Captain America suit best befitted him. Scarlett Johansson still livens up the screen with more than just her raw sex appeal and makes me want a standalone Black Widow movie than ever. Cap and Natasha makes for a splendid duo bringing out a chemistry we've rarely seen in the previous Marvel movies. Nick Fury played by Samuel L Jackson, need I say more? Its impossible to think of another actor in Nick's shoes the same way I can't imagine anybody other than Robert Downey Jr playing Tony Stark. Another good mention would be Anthony Mackie playing Sam Wilson aka Falcon and he does the job well. Amazing, Ace, Terrific are some of the words that rhymes with Robert Redford. I love Robert Redford from his Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid days and ever since I've been an ardent fan. Even in his 70s he packs the same flamboyance, the same charisma thats just unsurpassable and he carries the same here as Alexander Pierce, a senior member of SHIELD who had recruit Nick Fury into SHIELD.The Winter Soldier, whose identity I shall not reveal here, makes for a compelling antagonist and you would be wrong if you thought the movie's all about Cap going head to head with him. But when it does, its just epic. The Winter Soldier is plain relentless in beating Cap and you can feel Cap's will and strength crumbling in each of the encounters. A lot of additions has been made to the cast including Frank Grillo and Emily VanCamp and I am definitely sure that the characters introduced in this movie will grow onto the next marvel movie. Makes me think of amazing planning and coordination that went into the movie. Agent coulson, though, was sorely missed.The Winter Soldier's score composed by Henry Jackman would live upto his own compositions for X-Men First Class or Kick-Ass 2. Taking a Stand, Time To Suit Up and The Winter Soldier are some of the remarkable tracks that stands out from the OST assured to give you goosebumps. To top it all off Marvin Gaye's Trouble Man made me smile.The twist was something that hit hard and will create some major ripples in the Marvel movies. Thats what makes it tick, the events from Captain America The Winter Soldier will have its repercussions on upcoming movies as well and who knows what'll happen to Agents of SHIELD. Words just fail me to express how awesome Captain America The Winter Soldier turned out to be, I went in to watch another mediocre Marvel standalone movie and I was blown out of my wits. Yes it's slightly less grander than The Avengers but while The Avengers had a bunch of superheroes working together and Captain America The Winter Soldier had just one keeping you on the edge of your seats. Its a must watch for any Marvel fan and could be considered the smartest Marvel movie till date.And lastly do I even need to mention 'Shawarma'? Wait for the credit rolls and I promise it'll be worth your time.",8,2,4,18 April 2014
Life of Pi," How to turn a Classic to an Over-rated Visual-heavy flick!
","Life Of Pi, directed by Ang Lee, adapted from Yann Martel's Booker prize winning novel of the same name seems to be the talk of the town now. From the moment I'd seen the previews, I was not so sure I wanted to go for this one. This would just be another Avatar-clone cashing in on the 3D and 'jaw dropping visuals' and nothing else. And I was correct.Going with the 'monotonously obvious choice' for a cast when it comes to a Hollywood movies, Ang Lee went with AAA Indian actors like Irfan Khan and Tabu. I am not saying its a bad choice but weren't there any other Indian actors who could replace Irfan Khan/Tabu? The most interesting portions of the movie is with the boy, the tiger and the ocean and thus Life Of Pi could be watched for its powerful singular performance of débutant Suraj Sharma taking the whole show on his shoulders. The completely CG Tiger (I still have suspicions that almost all of 100 minutes of it is CG) is a work of marvel indeed. Gollum was the last one I was impressed with and although 'Richard Parker' wasn't as impressive as Gollum, it did manage to convince me and question me whether it was a real tiger or not. Add to that a remarkable score by Mychael Danna, Life of Pi does incredible wonders to both your sensesthough but it still seldom manages to touch your heart.I wouldn't be surprised if 'Life Of Pi' ends up in the Oscar buzz or even winning one just like the way the very-over-rated 'Slumdog Millionaire' had done. I never thought 'Slumdog Millionaire' deserved an Academy Award.its a technically sound, well adapted, well directed entertainer and there's nothing else to it. Likewise 'Life Of Pi' is a visually extravagant, well made piece of adapted material. Some books are so good they are called something: A Classic and movies adapted from them, no matter how well they are made, wont be called the same. 'Life Of Pi' might stay with us till the Academy Awards or until all these dust of visual gimmicks settles down, after that I am sure not many people would even remember it. Nonetheless do watch it and take your kids along with you, they wouldn't care all the philosophical and spiritual babble and chances are that they'd end up loving it more than you.",7,1,6,14 December 2012
Pacific Rim," An Adolescent boy's wet dream!
","Guillermo Del Toro has, first and foremost, been a visual director. Be it Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy or Hellboy 2 his level of visual flair is unsurpassed. More than that as evident from Pan's Labyrinth, he's also equally skillful in storytelling. Believe me Pan's Labyrinth is as twisted a simple fairytale can get. But he's had his fair share of hit and misses as well *cough* Don't be Afraid of the Dark *cough*. You know he's a good director when Peter Jackson himself chose Guilermo for directing The Hobbit trilogy. Unfortunately The Hobbit landed back in the hands of its own foster father than a step-dad. Its been 5 years since Guilermo's directed a movie. People thought he'd make a comeback with Hellboy but what came a surprise was Pacific Rim. First Look at its previews made me think 'oh yea, another Transformers clone' but I was direly wrong. Pacific Rim is more than Michael Bay's Transformers, more than just an homage to Robots Vs Monsters movies as well.Pacific Rim is a nothing but glorified Power Rangers for adults movie, but it nevertheless entertain you. Basically its human-built giant robots, Jaegars, against giant alien monsters, Kaiju. What ensures is a huge huge robot on monster action with some drama sprinkled over the top. Pacific Rim, as soon as it starts puts you in the thick of action and clocking in at 132 minutes there was never a boring sequence. The writing was exactly what you'd expect in this genre. The lines were forced and at times very very clichéd but admit it you were neither in for performances or a plotyou were in for giant monsters vs giant robots and u get served pretty damn well and hot. The Drift was an interesting mechanic that serves as the backbone for the movie. Was a bit let down when other Jaegars didn't get enough screen-time as Gypsy Danger. Would have died to see the Russian one go a bit more. Most of the Kaiju encounters takes place at night and watching the movie in 3D felt a bit tedious as it was super dark I would have loved it if there was at least one head to head Kaiju fight in broad daylight. Then again the fight sequences were insanely detailed much much more than Transformers where we could only see blurs and metal scraps. Here in Pacific Rim each punch, each blow the Kaiju and Jaegers delivered was felt with equal force.Pacific Rim doesn't have a star-studded cast and it doesn't need one when the the plot is focused on Jaegars and Kaijus. Idris Elba had always stood out be it whatever roles he was in. He plays Stacker Pentecost and his sheer flamboyance does an amazing job here as well. I was particularly impressed with his 'Do not let my calm demeanour fool you, ranger!' line. Rinko Kikuchi, as Mako Mari was good. I'd loved her in The Brothers Bloom where she delivered a solid performance without uttering a word. Her backstory here was touching, have to give kudos to the kid who played little Mako as well. It struck to me as vaguely similar to the Kim Phuc photo during the Viatnamese War. Comic relief by Charlie Day and Burn Gorman were good, it sometimes felt as cheesy but it was integral in this genre of movies. Guilermo's favorite Ron Perlman does a short role by name Hannibal Chau serving some chuckles. I was disappointed with the inadequate performance from the lead, Charlie Hunnam. Of course I've heard people saying his resemblance with Tron Legacy's Sam Flynn but thats just where the resemblances end. I just couldn't buy into his performance.Of course the real stars of Pacific Rim were the Jaegars and Kaiju and both were exquisitely detailed. Guillermo was never a stranger to monster designs, evident from some of the Hellboy and Pan Labyrinth monsters designed by himself.The Kaiju felt like intimidating hulking beasts of pure destruction and chaos and most of them modeled on monsterized versions of a shark, a gorilla etc. Loved them.Ramin Djawadi's score is pure spellbinding. I need not give an example more than Game of Throne's booming score. He does his magic again here with Pacific Rim. His score with the awesome visuals is enough to induce goosebumps. It leaves us in awe and beckons to be heard again and again. Tracks like 'Pacific Rim' and 'Gipsy Danger' is pure awesomeness.Pacific Rim is undoubtedly flawed in writing, performances and plot but it what it lacks there, it makes up with style, action and thrills. Pacific Rim isn't even close to Guillermo's Pan's Labyrinth or Hellboy in terms of storytelling but it excites you and it does give you an adrenaline rush watching the action packed fights and its more than any fanboy could ask for. Summer movies cant get any BIGGER than this. Go watch it at the movies now!",8,2,3,24 December 2013
American Hustle," Brilliant Performances, Over-rated Flick!
","I'd seen American Hustle soon after its release and till this time I'd been pondering what to make of it. I just couldn't figure out why it was acclaimed so much.David O Russell has become a go-to guy for Oscars it seems. No matter what movie he makes, its bound to win at least one Academy Award or at least get a couple of nominations. He's being doing it in a row and American Hustle has undoubtedly ended up on everybody's favorite list, some even preferring it more than Martin Scorsese's debauchery epic The Wolf of Wall Street or Steve McQueen's period drama on slavery, 12 Years a Slave. Myself having seen American Hustle, though, would stand on the other side of the fence.Silver Linings Playbook was one of those fine movies which captured my short attention span from start till end. Owe it all to the fabulous performances from Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper coupled with David O Russell's offbeat injection of comedy. While I could be called a Jennifer Lawrence superfan, I was not a big fan of Bradley Cooper, thanks to Alias, I could never shake off the image of Will Tippin from my mind but what can I say Silver Linings Playbook did make a fan outta me, well at least of his performance more rather than him. The Fighter was another film that had everything going for it, solid performances from Christian Bale and Mark Wahlberg, Amy Adams, David's direction and a brilliant script. David O Russell, far from his I Heart Huckabees days was indeed churning out finely made movies.American Hustle held a lot of promises having pulled the inexplicably talented stars from both Silver Linings Playbook and The Fighter. A slew of arguably the best actors from Hollywood but were they put to best use? I'll stick with 'Nah'. The actors however were at their best, having fun with their respective roles. American Hustle has a lot of style as well, the actors and the settings were all set ablaze with genuine looking costumes and props. I mean the direction was good, actors were plenty and performed well but all that doesn't make a great movie? I was irked by two issues: 1: The Pacing. Compared to The Wolf of Wall Street's 3 Hours which felt like a breeze, American Hustle's mere 138 felt laboring. It did have its fast moments but at times it felt excruciatingly slow. And problem number 2: The obvious predictability. I don't know if it was intended that way but the predictability this movie carried made me question O Russell. Considering this was a con movie, everybody would agree the final revelation wasn't the least epic Hey, I was brewn so, expecting something revelatory is totally normal and would have just made American Hustle GREAT. a la Oceans Eleven!Christian Bale's amazing sincerity towards his role had been evident from frame one. We've seen him get emaciated in The Machinist then get beefed up for his Batman roles then again get thin in The Fighter. Here we've got a flabby potbellied balding Bale in the role of Irving Rosenfeld. Bale has once again shows us that he can take on any kinda role, superhero or not. Bradley Cooper yet again displays off his acting prowess and shows that he's come a long way from his Alias days. Amy Adams proves that she can sizzle both as a commercial or art-house actress, be it Lois Lane or the insanely glamorous Sydney Prosser. Her side bosom gets a special mention as well. Jennifer Lawrence as the raunchy Rosalyn Rosenfeld was so adorable despite her slightly grey tone in the movie. Its impossible not to like her even when she plays a horny, yammering, naggy wifeand does it near perfectly. To see C K Louis was a pleasant surprise and scenes with him and Bradley Cooper did pack a lot of laughs. Jeremy Renner ends up in a solid role, this guy had been looked upon post his Hawkeye role but I am glad that he did an excellent job as Mayor Carmine Polito.American Hustle's soundtrack, though was thoroughly enjoyable, be it along with the visuals or not. The score composed by Danny Elfman really stood out and kept a admirably fast pace for an otherwise slow procession of things. The selection of songs featured on the OST was also noteworthy.Agreed, American Hustle had great performances, a decent storyline and excellent direction and in all sense its a perfectly watchable flick but does it deserve an Academy Award just for affixing 'America' to its title? Not quite. I have nothing against the Academy's incline towards American movies or directors but there is a roster of much better movies nominated this year which genuinely deserves it.",6,2,3,19 April 2014
Man of Steel," Not quite the best but good enough for the Next gen
","Think about Comic books, who's the first superhero that comes to your mind? Its always been Superman. Since the day I could speak, since the day I could figure out things for myself, Superman had been a legend. A true SUPER-superhero, an icon of sheer courage, justice. Haven't we all draped a towel on our back and pretended to be him. And then came the movies, the beloved Christopher Reeves' Superman. It had been etched in my mind since then. The accompanying John Williams theme, Superman soaring through the chroma-keyed skies, the visuals stuck in my head even now. Thanks for Bryan Singer's Superman Returns for unmaking a Superman fan out of me. On paper Superman Returns felt like a brilliant idea, people were already familiar with Superman's origins and setting the stage for what could have been the best Superman movie sounded very good but lack of somethings made Superman Returns one of the worst Superman movies I could ever imagine. Fans have ever since yearned for a proper Superman reboot especially when Christopher Nolan had made the near-perfect Batman trilogy.I was in ecstasy when I heard Nolans name linked with a new Superman reboot and at the same time I was a bit skeptic when Zack Synder's name got attached to it as the director. Agreed, Zack Snyder is a talented director with his rep billowing with Watchmen, Dawn of The Dead and 300 but the same couldn't be said about the ambitious-yet-disastrous Sucker Punch. David S Goyer & Christopher Nolan providing the story for the reboot came as a much needed relief.Enter Man Of Steel, Zack Snyder's take on Superman. I have to say by the time I walked outta the theater I had a smile on my face, I was glad it was way beyond my expectations, my suspicions regarding Zack Snyder washed off. Zack Snyder proves that he could handle both touching sequences as well as loud, insane action sequences with the same prowess. Henry Cavill drapes the cape here playing Kal-El/Clark Kent. Things like Clark Kent constantly in conflict with himself and his identity-masking issues was beautifully handled. A ton of credit also goes to Henry Cavill for being the best Superman since Christopher Reeves. He was both adorable and unstoppable as Clark Kent/Superman. Believe me this ain't the Henry Cavill you've seen in The Immortals, he oozes that charm as well as the bravado that Superman needs. Believe me you'll be rooting for him, clenching your seats in awe by the time he takes his first flight.Man Of Steel's first half was very emotional/touching, call it 'butterflies in the tummy' or 'mere convulsions or heaves' there were many touching scenes that did make you feel that lump in the throat. Seamless flashbacks were another thing I loved connecting Clark Kent's present to his younger days. Kevin Costner, was just great as Jonathan Kent especially considering he'd got comparatively less screen time than Russel Crowe's Jor-El. Costner's Jonathan was very heartfelt and those handful of scenes he were in, he made it inevitably memorable. Tell me you didn't gasp when Costner delivered that 'You'll always be my son!' dialogue. Tell me you didn't feel your eyes getting wet during Jonathan's 'farewell' scene. Diane Lane also brought forth that sincere motherly instinct that Martha Kent needed. Anyways coming back to Russel Crowe, he was just as bad-ass as his son, sharing around 45 minutes of screen-time, he had his fatherly moments as well action. Amy Adams as Lois Lane was, as always, a pleasure to be seen on screen, fitting the role perfectly. I wasn't convinced with her handling those alien guns btw.Michael Shannon's General Zod was way different than Terence Stamp's. Where Terence's Zod was more calm and scheming, Michael's was in constant rage, in constant aggression and it was very well suited given his urgency to create a new Krypton and as we all know from Boardwalk Empire, there's no one better than Shannon when it comes to showing rage. Then again Shannon wouldn't be the talk of the day after you've seen Man OF Steel, unlike Heath Ledger's Joker. Faora-Ul seemed much more lethal than General Zod. Where Zod has true motives to do villainous acts, Faora-Ul was just pure evil and Antje Traue, soon to be seen in Riddick, does it well.Where the 1st and 2nd act promised true immersion the same couldn't be said for the 3rd act which was squeezed, every inch, with action. But its not like Michael Bay-ish action where we couldn't figure WTF was going on on-screen, in Man Of Steel, each punch Superman delivered could be felt. I've heard people complaining about the OTT action, but that's what you get one when one super power meets another. This is Superman for chrissake what did you expect?Visual Effects towards the finale were not entirely convincing, I don't know if its me but I could clearly make out the CG counterparts from the real actors.And lastly, amidst all those destruction and carnage I cant help but think about the human causalities. Superman was always supposed to be a savior to all not just his love interest.All said, done and anathemised, Man Of Steel is not a movie to cash in on the superhero genre. It did meet a Superman fanboy's expectation and as Jor-El said 'You will give the people an ideal to strive towards' and that ideal could very well be a Justice League movie. Quoting once again, at one point Superman says about his glyph 'It's not an 'S',on my world it means 'Hope'. It does bring hope to the Superman franchise long thought to be dead, comparisons with Christopher Reeves' Superman movies aside, Man of Steel is the definitive Superman for the new generation. Take a bow Henry Cavill/Zack Snyder team.",8,3,6,24 December 2013
Kung Fu Panda 2," Totally the 'Return of AWESOMENESS'
","Kung Fu Panda 2 was a delightful watch! Totally loved it. There are some movies that makes you glad and satisfied till the end...and Kung Fu Panda 2 is one among them...each scene is crafted with the best dialogues, visuals and a chockful of humor that'll make you laugh/content till the end. There's not a single scene that will bore you. Jack Black as Po, this time is accompanied by the first movies' cast, Angleina Jolie as Tigress, Seth Rogen as Mantis, Jackie Chan as Monkey, David Cross as Crane, Lucy Liu as Viper, Dustin Hoffman as Shifu...with a few new additions including Gary Oldman as the wonderfully voice-overed (Po's) menace, Shen; Michelle Yeoh, Jean Claude Van Damm, Dennis Hayesbert etc. Jack Black & Gary Oldman steals every scene they are in; together or apart.The legendary Hans Zimmer & John Powell's combined score was pure 'earcandy'. The 3D was delicious...this movie, like Avatar & Tron LEGACY is meant to be watched in 3D. Absolutely amazing CG visuals coupled with equally awe-inspiring 2D animation makes it a treat to watch. Past movies like Thor, Pirates Of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides were only excuses to cash in on the 3D...though Kung Fu Panda 2 was made with all passion & sincerity to provide the best and right use of 3D.My only minor complaint here is that some of the cast were underutilized, esp Po's mates' dialogues IMO were so less compared to the first movie. KUDOS to Jennifer Yuh for a wonderfully entertaining sequel and yes...those are a rarity these days. There's obviously a Kung Fu Panda 3 coming, as evident from the last scene, and my fingers are crossed for it..until then Ska2oosh! :D",9,1,5,26 May 2011
We're the Millers," Enjoyable but Shallow.
","We're The Millers is the latest R Rated flick telling the story of David Clark, a low level drug dealer who is assigned by his boss to move 'some' marijuana from Mexico to the US. He assembles The Millers, a family of sort which includes his neighbours, a Stripper, a runaway teenage girl and an 18 year old virgin. Under this pretense they hope to transport the marijuana in an RV and the movie is about the perils they face on their way. Basically its one of those roadtrip movies where the 'friends' are replaced by a 'fake family'.Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber of the Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story fame, We're The Millers sets out the promise of being uproariously hilarious. The previews were good and it did seem like a run-of-the-mill comedy flick. And it deliver, the first half of the movie was indeed hilarious but halfway through it began stuttering both in pace and comedy. Post the second act, the scenes with another RV family felt like it went on forever. Had it been trimmed down a bit the movie would have been a much better watch.I never felt Jason Sudekis was a main-lead-material. Well, he tries hard here to convince me but even that fell flat. Maybe its coz the fact that this guy is boning Olivia Wilde that envies me (kidding obviously). The only movies I've seen Emma Roberts in a female-lead role were It's Kind of a Funny Story and 4.3.2.1. and she doesn't have a lot to do here as one of the Millers but she doesn't disappoint either. Will Poulter, despite his odd looks was surprisingly entertaining as well. Jennifer Aniston does steal all the limelight though, her striptease obviously being one of the (and most likely the only) USPs here. And it does bring a smile to my face that, strip or not, she's still got the same charm from F.R.I.E.N.D.SReferences to The Simpsons, The Dark Knight Rises were thrown in for cheap laughs. At times jokes felt bland and boring but that doesn't make the movie thoughthere are indeed scenes that tickle your funny bone. We're The Millers does not have over the top humor, neither does it have that much R rated jokes to make you feel like its Hangover all over again but for what its worth its okay for a lazy weekend watch. Ooh and wait till the end credits coz there is sweet sweet scene in the bloopers reel.",6,0,1,24 December 2013
The Lego Movie," Went in Skeptical, Came out Awesome!
","Remember those times when you were a kid and used to make dramatic, action packed movies playing with your action figures and toys? Lego movie does just that, just much better than an 8 year old though. I'll put this right there, I am not a fan of Lego! I had a wannabe Lego set when I was young (Thank you, China!) and later on I did have my own authentic legos as well but I just couldn't get what all the hype was about. They started making video games on every other franchise out there and I never touched one and when the news came that these guys were upto making a full length animated Lego movie, I was rolling my eyes. So when it finally released, I thought to give it a shot. Well I couldn't possibly ignore the rave reviews, could I?From directors, Phil Lord, Christopher Miller who previously gave us the uproarious 21 Jump Street comes Lego Movie. I was in as soon as I heard these two names were attached with the Lego project. You also have to count Cloudy with a Chance of meatballs which was some pure entertainment for kids and adults alike. Lego Movie tells the story of Emmett who's a hapless construction worker, a nobody, who's taken on the ride of his lifetime when he stumbles on an artifact. Joining his adventure is the ravishing Wyldstyle and the wizard Vitruvius and spanning across a wide range of Lego universes. From DC Universe and Star Wars to Lord of The Rings and TMNT and then some more.Brilliant animation which is actually computer animated but made to look like its stop motion and has been maintained till end. I started searching if there were anything not made out of legos and I was surprised to find none, even the water, fire and smoke was made out of legos (There were of course some 'relics' which was obviously real world things). The 3rd act was what surprised me. And I liked the inclusion of.you know what? I'll let you have that surprise. It might not work for some but I am glad it did for me. And that inclusion made all the difference, it was that stroke of sheer genius that made Lego movie from being good to 'awesome'.Brilliantly voiced characters enlivens the screen and some big names are attached as well. From Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson, to Will Farrel and Elizabeth Banks. You of course get Chris Pratts amazingly voiced lead Emmett and makes the character adorable and endearing. But the real show stealer? Batman. I laughed hard every other gag the Batman was involved, and all thanks to Will Arnett's perfect voice over.My only qualm about the movie was that it would have been perfect in 2D, the me-too 3D feature kinda trampled the experience to some degree. In the end I am still am not a fan of the toys but I've convinced myself to become a fan of the franchise, both the games and movies. With splendidly written characters, fast paced and humorous narrative, and excellent voice overs, The Lego Movie promises truckloads of fun. It could have all been a 100 minute promotion for Lego, a huge ad for Lego considering the movie has squeezed in everything they could and what results is not a convoluted piece of junk but a good movie which offers true entertainment.",7,2,6,19 April 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Brian Singer tries to undo the X-Men franchise damages
","I remember the time when I was all jacked up when I saw the previews of X-Men. I was blown away when I saw the movie on VHS as well. Such an ensemble cast and Wolverine seemed to pack quite the punch. X2 Xmen United was better than I'd expected and the less said about X- Men The Last Stand, the better. Bryan Singer undoubtedly a skilled director as evident from The Usual Suspects and not to mention handling an ensemble cast like X-Men was no easy feat. But a look back at his recent flicks (Superman Returns, Jack The Giant Slayer), you are bound to set your hopes a bit low for X-Men Days of Future Past. Despite his fairly brilliant initial track record, I myself was skeptic about X-Men Days of Future Past especially when Matthew Vaughn's X-Men First Class had a set a bar at how well made an X-Men could be.Off to a very rocky start, Days of Future Past introduces to a dystopian 2023 run by Sentinels and the few remaining mutants fighting for their lives. I mentioned 'rocky' coz you are thrown into the thick of the action and despite the brilliant sequence, if you are not familiar with the X-Men lore you'd be wondering who these mutants are. You'll feel right at home when Charles Xavier, Eric Lensher Logan and Storm enters the scene. Logan is sent back to 1973 by Kitty Pride to prevent Trask Industries to ever build these Sentinels. Logan meets up with a younger Xavier, Hank, Eric and Raven and sets about to save the world once again. What ensures is a good two plus hours of entertainment.Time Travel is used as a plot device and a lot could go wrong if there ain't much thought put into it. Thanks to Bryan Singer the comic series of the same name, time travel n Days of Future Past works just fine. It fills in most of the conflicts caused in the franchise's timeline but then again by the end of Days Of Future Past, the original X-Men trilogy supposedly never happens (If I am correct). There are some nifty sequences that'll make you go Whoa. The Magneto Prison break sequence in particular, left me in awe, thanks to Quicksilver. This rendition of Quicksilver was so good and leaves me wondering if this version would come on top if it had to go head to head with the upcoming Joss Whedon version from The Avengers Age of Ultron. I guess you cant have too much of a good thing as Quicksilver is sent home just after the said sequence.Unlike the spinoffs the X-Men series had always been about the Mutant-Human war and its the same here. There is a ton of other story arcs that had loads more potential but it sticks to the same formulaic arc. Another qualm were the mere glimpses of mutants like Bishop, Wink, Colossus and even Storm and used as just baits. While the mutants showed off some cool combat, these are pretty relevant characters from the X-Men series and to make them just cannon fodder, not cool! X- Men Days Of Future past delivers but I felt it doesn't have that charm or the heart X-Men First Class had. And if ranked X-Men Days of Future Past might be a notch below X2 X-Men United and First Class. There is a ton of fan service here and it is also advised to watch the past X- Men movies to get the complete gist of Days of Future Past.Bryan Singer once again proves that he's good with an ensemble cast. Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Peter Dinklage, Ian McKellan, Patrick Stewart, Ellen Page all plays noteworthy roles in Days of Future Past. If this isn't star studded, I don't know what is. In almost all the previous X-Men movies Hugh Jackman usually steals the show, and he does most of the heavy lifting here as well but a bit of the limelight is also shared or rather snatched by James McAvoy playing the younger Xavier. McAvoy displays a remarkable performance and brings in layers of emotions to the man in the wheel chair. Michael Fassbender also shines throughout with his cold steel looks and grey shades. Jennifer Lawrence excels in being Mystique as well as sexy and becomes one of the most indispensable characters in the narrative. Boliver Trask wasn't even a dwarf in the original X- Men lore and yet Peter Dinklage nails it, his acting prowess was all that was needed and not his height.The visuals were fairly impressive, but I did notice some itsy bitsy flaws here and there. I loved the way the footages from 1973 had a kind of Eastman color shade to it. The Future Sentinels were impressively rendered and felt daunting indeed. The X-Men theme makes a comeback as well, Thanks to John Ottman. While it wouldn't even come close to Henry Jackman's awe inspiring original score from X-Men First Class, Ottman's score still brought forth a sense of nostalgia.X-Men Days of Future Past is a great comeback for Bryan Singer and some of the faith in him has been restored. It doesn't break any grounds and despite its gaping plot holes and flaws, X-Men Days of Future Past makes for a good entertaining flick. Go watch it!PS: As its tradition, do wait for the credit roll to get over for some awesome Post Credit Sequence paving way to the next in series: X-Men Apocalypse.",7,1,1,15 September 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," All Hail Smaug!
","If you thought Peter Jackson's idea of stretching out a children's book into a trilogy was a bad idea, think again! Had it not been made so, we would have missed out on some of the best entertainment for 3 years. Without much ado, The Hobbit The Desolation of Smaug, sequel to last year's The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey, is one of the best movies I have seen/experienced this year and undoubtedly stands to be the best in the series so far.The Desolation Of Smaug starts off exactly where Unexpected Journey left off, well not exactly per se. Following a short Peter Jackson cameo you are thrown into a flashback where Gandalf convinces Thorin to reclaim his kingdom and from there on you are put into 3 hour roller coaster ride filled with much more exhilarating action and adventure than the original, but testing your bladders a bit. But that was expected from a Peter Jackson movie, wasn't it? And I am sure, we'd get much more to see in an extended cut soon enough. Nonetheless sitting through Desolation felt like a breeze with little boredom to pull you out of it.The Desolation of Smaug doesn't shy away from packing quite a lot of action and adventure. Sprinkled with characters old and new, this is fantasy at its best fueled by J R R Tolkien's masterful literature along with some additions from Hollywood's skilled screenwriters. Yes, The Desolation of Smaug, for obvious reasons adds to the story and features characters and sequences which was never in the book. Peter Jackson has taken the liberty to do so and it does wonders, more than its prequel. While the original, despite being a visual grandeur, came just a bit short on drama and characterization, Desolation transcends them to some degree.Martin Freeman reprises his role as Bilbo Baggins and he seemed, still, the best option for the role, his obsession with the ring growing stronger than ever as he builds his courage more and more for the quest. As does, Ian McKellan playing the ever powerful, heartwarming Gandalf, his presence in the movie was felt and every time I saw him walk across a narrow ledge, I yearned him to yell 'You, shall not pass!' one more time. Unlike the reckless ruckus from the first, this time around the Dwarfs are given much more of a personality and most of them stood out especially Killi who shared a bit of romance with Evangeline Lily's Tauriel, the wood elf. And talk about elves, Orlando Bloom and Evangeline Lily makes for a splendid duo, kicking orc butts like never before. Richard Armitage's Thorin too was given a much needed boost showing his inner struggles to forgo anything to reclaim his kingdom.Let's allot a paragraph for the ultimate attraction Desolation offers, shall we? Yep, Smaug! If you've thought that they showed too much of Smaug in the previews believe me when I say you haven't seen nothing. Smaug, brilliantly voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch, is one of the wonders this movie's got to outbid. I agree I have slain my fair share of dragons in Skyrim, but to my surprise, Smaug wasn't anything like it. It's the spectacle that we'd been waiting for since we saw its gargantuan eye teased in the first and it delivers a sequence that'll forever be etched in all of LOTR/ Tolkien fans. I was totally in love with the Bilbo-Gollum encounter from the first, but this surpasses it on all levels.Treading on lands far from Shire, our heroes are put into visually rich locales, be it Mirkwood or Laketown, everything had an uncanny authenticity. The CG and art that's been put into the movie is on par with The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy albeit a bit better. There were indeed some CG here and there that felt clumsy and coming from WETA, its kind of unforgivable. The IMAX experience was worth every penny and I suppose that's exactly why the level of immersion was delivered. Howard Shore's score does perfectly sync with the visuals but I'll need to listen to it more to comment on it more.The Hobbit The Desolation of Smaug is, first and foremost, an action adventure movie and Peter Jackson has done a great job in setting things up for the grand finale next year. Unlike the first, which took its own sweet time to set the heroes on quest, Desolation puts you straight in to the thick of all action and it was the indeed best way to end this year. The Hobbit series might not be known as much as the epic LOTR, but its charm is bound to make you love and cherish it.",7,0,2,24 December 2013
Wreck-It Ralph," A true/awesome Video game-Movie!
","Video game movies, if I remember correct, have always sucked! Owe it all to directors like Uwe Boll, who made every other video game adaptation suck. What could have been mediocre if not great video game adaptations were thrashed well beyond recognition. Of course we do have 'loosely- based-on/cheesy-but-enjoyable' Resident Evil franchise and 'Live action movies' based on major game titles produced by the game studios itself ala 'Halo Forward Unto Dawn'. But a good video game-movie was still in destituteness.ie until now!If you are the ones who like to skip previews before the feature film I'd say go early and it'll pay you off quite immensely for there is a gem of a Pixar short to be seen. Entitled 'Paperman', words just fails me to describe how lovely its animated. I wont spoil anything here you just have to watch it for yourself!The story is paper thin, Ralph plays an antagonist in a game called 'Fix it Felix'. While the protagonist of the game, 'Felix' makes friends with everyone; Good-at-heart-Ralph gets tired playing the bad guy for 30 straight years and he decides to prove that he is not so mean. To please his fellow NPCs he sets on a journey to earn a medal in a game and bring back his glory. The plot sounded good enough to show off a plethora of vivid game worlds that Ralph ends up in, but sadly it ain't so and we are given mere 3 game worlds; Ralph's own 'Fix it Felix' game, the Halo- esque 'Hero's Duty' game and the very kiddish 'Sugar Rush where most of the story takes place. Of course we do get to see the 'Game Central' where most of the game characters as well as NPCs use it as a transit. It was a who's who of characters when it came to Game Central, Sega's characters aplenty along with some old. It all spirals down to a cameo- heaven of a movie filled with truck load of game characters inducing nostalgia in almost every frame. Gamers will know exactly what I am talking about. And there comes the second problem the non-gaming community could well be put off with some of the iconic characters in the movie as they are not aware of em. For instance while I was laughing my ass off at the Metal Gear Solid 'exclamation' in a scene, but my friend was sitting beside me numb seemingly incognizant about the Metal Gear Solid lore. I am sure kids will love it but amidst these Call Of Duty generation who would know about arcade classics like 'Qbert'?'Ralph' is voiced by John C Reilly and I think nobody could have done it better. He literally voiced life into Ralph. I just could digest Sarah Silverman pulling off a kids voice. Maybe its me, I've seen her literally churn out abuses and couldn't visualize her voicing the 'shes- so-cute, I-am-gonna-die-Vanellope'. On the other hand Jane Lynch's PG13 trash spewing bad-ass 'Calhoun' was a pure delight to watch and maybe its coz she's portrayed as one hot female gamer. Alan Tudyk's 'King Candy' too was a worthy mention.The animation is spot on, from the jerky movements of the characters in Fix It Felix to the super fluid 'HD' animations of Hero's Duty it all complements the appropriate game worlds. Myself being an FPS fanatic, I loved 'Hero's duty' game and would like to get my hands on it. Fix It Felix will make you relive your old arcade adventures. The score by Henry Jackman was pure awesome. He's turning out to be quite a Hans Zimmer. He'd composed the score for X-Men First Class and it had been one of my favorites from last year. Equally satisfying is the soundtrack featuring excellent tracks by Owl City, Skrillex and Rihanna. My favorite was the 'Celebration' track by Kool & Gang. Be sure to check out the soundtrack, its worth it.Wreck-it Ralph is an incredibly fresh and heartfelt take on videogames. Its not a video game adaptation per se but its a movie made for video game lovers by video game lovers. As I said before, non-gamers and even casual gamers may find themselves disrupted but not too be distracted from the plot.",8,2,3,14 December 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A Little Less on Grandeur but a must-watch nonetheless!
","The Lord of Rings Trilogy by J R R Tolkien could be considered one of mankind's magnificent literary works. Tolkien wrote a true epic complete with supporting languages, maps and what not. Considering its magnitude it was considered unfilmable, yet Peter Jackson did it. Of course he took liberties in adapting the magnanimous books to celluloid yet the same epicness was captured in his movie trilogy. Peter Jackson did indeed set a milestone in filming history, with his LOTR trilogy having legendary battles, never before seen CG wizardry and backed by Tolkien's own works it was to nobody's amazement that Return of King had won 13 Academy Awards.Peter Jackson decided to pool in more stories from the Middle Earth to The Hobbit and make it a trilogy. The previews were decent enough but nothing bragged to go watch the movie. I decided to watch this one in IMAX as it boasted of superior visuals and sound. And believe me when I say 'I was never disappointed!'The Hobbit promises & delivers almost everything the previous LOTR movies had done. Heroism, Courage, Adventure, Fantasy everything you could ever imagine on Middle Earth. The Story of Bilbo Baggins couldn't have been told any better. You get to see familiar characters, you revisit familiar placesit was just nostalgic. I was comfortably seated on the very uncomfortable PVR IMAX due to one good reason: I was very much immersed in the movie. And despite its 160 minutes run time, it seldom gets boring.Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins was clumsy and quirky than the adolescent Hobbitses of LOTR Trilogy. I have to say he was better than Frodo or Sam. I felt all the characters, good or bad, had equal screen time and they all stood out. It really matters because you've got like 13 dwarfs scampering on screen at any given time, each with their own individual personality. It was indeed a feat to give em all equal importance and Peter Jackson has done it skillfully. Of which, Thorin played fantastically by Richard Armitage stands out, even with all those layers of prosthetic. Ian McKellan once again reprises his role as Gandalf the Grey and its always good to see him. Andy Serkis returns as the ever-malevolent Gollum, revamped and re-CG'd in all its grandeur. I had a wave of goosebumps through me when I was first given a glimpse of Gollum. The sequence where Bilbo & Gollum plays a game of riddle is one of the high points of 'The Hobbit'. It once again it reminded me why Gollum was my favorite computer generated characters of all time. The Pale Orc, Azog, felt just bland. It was one thing to see Gollum brought back to life in CG in all its glory and to compare it with Azog unthinkable. It only makes me wonder with all this budget why didn't Peter & WETA put their efforts in creating Azog as lifelike as Gollum. Azog never felt like an intimidating antagonist either.Peter Jackson has masterfully recreated the living breathing world of Middle Earth, yet again. You get sucked into this world of fantasy in no time. Epic battles are never a stranger to the LOTR movies and its no different in The Hobbit albeit a little less epic I'd say. It was a true delight to watch it all in 3D.Fun is stamped all over the movie. Even when our heroes are rushing past Trolls, Orcs and Goblins, even when everything was at stake, comedy was delivered throughout their adventure. There comes a tiny thing that put me off. The movie is really jovial at times and in the next, they show something really gory. I was kinda disoriented why they'd done it. It is an adaptation of a kids book and there wasn't any need of this kinda gore. At least not to please the adult audiences. I am a fan of gore, but I thought the addition of gore in this one was really unnecessary.Sound Design was superb and I'd be glad if it gets an Academy Award. The clangs & swishes of swords, hammers, the Troll yells of Agony everything was superb. Howard Shore's score was warm, welcoming and mellow at times, heroic and adventurous the other. 'Misty Mountains' is a very noteworthy track that you'd be most likely humming on your way home from the movies.CG felt great, but there were sequences that felt unfinished. IMAX didn't help at that either because the details were almost in your face and I was like'oh thats a blue screen scene', 'this is totally CG'. A bit more finesse could have helped.The Hobbit The Unexpected Journey, does recapture the very good feeling of watching a Tolkien movie but being the first movie in a planned trilogy it was unable to get that 'Fellowship' vibe. Partly because the subject matter of the Hobbit's tale was never as vast as the LOTR trilogy. They are just squeezing in bits of other lore from Tolkiens works to make a trilogy and it definitely has that feeling. I expected to see 'Smaug' but I was disappointed, I anticipated a cliffhanger ending like that of 'Two Towers' and I was disappointed again. In short Peter Jackson is letting us know that everything can't be as epic as LOTR. The Hobbit, like Fellowship, felt incomplete to be justifying the the impending sequel. But being a fan-boy the ride was awesome nonetheless. With, The Unexpected Journey, lets just hope that The Hobbit is setting, rather grandly, of things to come.",8,5,16,17 December 2012
Non-Stop," A Thriller as fast as its title!
","Liam Neeson, the guy whom I first remember seeing in Schindler's List, then as Qui Gon Jinn in Star Wars Episode I and later on as Ra's Al Ghul in Batman Begins and recently from a dozen other memes tagged with 'I don't who you are but I will find you and kill you' . Liam has had the best of both worlds, Award-centric movies as well as mindless action movies. But thanks to 2008′s Taken, Liam has had a major face-lift, from a talented actor who could convincingly portray Oskar Schindler to a guy who could utter any dialogue with an unmatching intimidation that would make any guy pee in his pants. Don't believe me? Watch this!So in Non-Stop, Liam Neeson plays an alcoholic, jerk of an Air Marshall on a flight where things starts to go down the spiral. He gets a text on his encrypted networked phone where someone says that he'll be killing off passengers every 20 minutes unless he gets 'his' 150 Million dollars transferred and there on the nonstop action starts. Things are set in motion where people starts getting killed and keeps, you as well as, Liam guessing the 'whodunnit'. Its thrilling and manages to be a real nail-biter till the last 15 minutes or so but you gotta suspend your disbelief a lot. On paper the plot seems perfect and as for the screenwriters advantage it works well, but on film and as an audience you gotta admit that it might not end up exactly as its planned out to be. The world never works that perfectly where someone plans something and it goes exactly like that. Example? Passengers getting killed at every exact 20 minutes and every other covariant works out perfectly well and thats exactly what the facet is here.Liam Neeson is obviously bad-ass in this and he sports the same menacing attitude from his previous action movies but it works well. There were elements of vulnerability but when you've got a script that moves as fast as a plane that flies 500 miles per hour, there's little room for character building such as that. You have to admit he carries the plot on his shoulder and does keep you entertained. As for the supporting cast there's that guy who played Thomas Wayne from Batman Begins, Anson Mount whom I was sure looked a lot like Jim Caviezel, Julianne Moore as the annoying passenger who just wanna sit beside Liam Neeson and a couple of other familiar faces thrown around all for the question of doubt. As soon as you see one familiar face you start guessing 'Oh this guy, he's the one' because thats how Hollywood works ain't it?Considering its from Jaume Collet-Serra who previously gave us Unknown and the immensely entertaining Orphan, you know Non-Stop will be more than just watchable. As I said Non-Stop works out well till the end and you ARE definitely entertained for the movies' 90 plus minutes and thats when the mystery gets revealed and you go from suspensive mode to MEH. Especially when you find out who and why its done. For what its worth I did enjoy the tense moments and you kinda root for Liam Neeson as each step that gets him closer to solving the mystery gets thwarted by the 'man who plans'. Is this a movie that rockets him to more badassery? Yes and as evidently a Taken 3 is in the works as we speak. Though, for me give me The Grey 2 anytime.",Null,1,2,3 March 2014
Gone Girl," Marriage Material!
","I'd started reading Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl a few months back and a few chapters in, I thought to myself 'Know what? I'd give Fincher a chance with this one and then I'll finish reading!' Since then I'd been patiently waiting for Gone Girl's release. I was excited what with Fincher being one of my favorite directors. The previews didn't tell much but still had that eerie touch to it that kept me waiting. Finally, yesterday I got to watch Gone Girl and without further ado I'd like to add that it was without doubt one of the best movies I'd seen this year.Nick Dunne and Amy Dunne, upon losing their jobs and going bankrupt, relocates to Missouri and on the morning of their 5th anniversary, Amy goes missing. Investigation ensues and all eyes, including the media's, rests upon Nick who has no clue what happened to Amy. As the movie progresses all odds are against Nick and it becomes a crime drama thriller, a whodunnit putting all suspicion on Nick. Has he killed her or not? Nick also unravels some stuff about his wife. Gone Girl goes back and forth from the investigation and the media circus to flashback scenes where Amy narrates her fears about being with her husband. What's pretty obvious is that the victim is not who you think she is and throughout the movie you are trying to find out what's off with the whole scenario and at times you will find yourself perplexed as to who you should be rooting for, Nick or Amy.I have always adored David Fincher's movies be it the ill-received Alien 3 or Se7en. Of course most of the his films are adapted from original source materials but on celluloid he does know how to deliver an intellectually supreme thriller. David Fincher plays all the cards right here and Gone Girl makes for an immersive, tense and compelling crime drama thriller. You yourself adorn the detective's cape and try to figure things for yourself but Fincher makes sure that you don't reach the conclusion that easily as he constantly throws twists and turns at you that glues you to your seats.There's not one performance that could be looked down upon and along with Fincher's solid direction it all comes to a fine full circle. I remember seeing Rosamund Pike as a ravishing bond girl in Die Another Day and in many more mediocre roles from Doom to Wrath Of The Titans etc. Who would have thought she would deliver a performance that makes you go all dumbfounded. She went from vulnerable to intimidating to manipulative to sheer conniving. I'd say the best part about Gone Girl would be her. I'll just put this here, I am not a Ben Affleck fan and I was one among the many who cringed at the news that he was going to be the next Batman. I love his direction, I love his writing but I just don't like to see him screen. But its time to put all that out of the way. Affleck is solid here and gives one of his career-best performances and I am one step closer to tolerate seeing him on screen. Carrie Coon plays Margo, Nick's twin sister and she was adorably cute and her scenes with her brother were some of the best ones. Supporting cast also includes Tyler Perry, a celebrity lawyer who charges his clients a $100,000 as retainer fee and he does his part just fine. I am not used to watching Tyler Perry movies (thanks Madea), but some of the jovial moments were well done. Initially, I thought Neil Patrick Harris was an odd choice for a David Fincher movie but he gave an impeccable performance as well. Media also plays a major role in the movie and it almost plays like a character even manipulating you at times.Gone Girl is beautifully shot. It looked as if the whole of Missouri looked mourning in Amy's missing and it takes a more warm tone during the films third act. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's score is indeed an icing on the cake goes perfectly sync with the spellbinding visuals. Fincher's own The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was banned in India due to its graphic rape scene and I was skeptic if Gone Girl, with its domestic violence scenes, would walk down the same alley. I thank the censor board for being sensible and not doing so and also zooming in on the non nude parts than chopping off entire scenes made much more sense.Mark my words, this movie is gonna test your bladders and you will feel like keeping it in so do go for this movie with an empty bladder and don't even think of that maxi size Pepsi at the counter. You wouldn't want to miss anything. Its close to 3 hours and the only times I looked at my watch was due to my impatient bladder than due to getting bored. Its that much engrossing.Gone Girl is a bit about marriage and what all can go worse in a marriage. Its a bit superficial, yes, but Fincher grounds the movie in a believable reality that it doesn't really matter. This isn't Finchers Magnum opus in fact it doesn't even come close to it, ie Fight Club. Nonetheless he manages to build a cohesive and immensely immersive Crime Drama that plays with your wits till end. Can't recommend this more!",8,3,10,5 November 2014
Frozen," Served, a little less Tangled, a lot more Frozen!
","I am not always a big fan of Disney Animated movies. What with all the adorably naive princesses and prince charmings I always felt it was way too mushy for me. There were a few exceptions though Wreck-it Ralph, the best among them. Wreck-it Ralph followed similar child friendly, Disney style but instead of focusing on fairy tales and princesses, it was based on the world of video games and boy that was some ride. Yet another exception was 2010′s Tangled, which was a very enjoyable take on the Rapunzel fairy tale. The gorgeous visuals and intriguing characters all came alive with Tangled albeit with its own twists, and thus Disney got its formula.Enter Frozen. Disney's foray back to familiar territory after a short Wreck-it break. Without spoiling much, Frozen is based on the fairy tale, The Snow Queen and as family friendly as Disney animated goes, it doesn't have the least of dark side the fairy tale had. Its kinda like a prequel to the fairy tale with lush lovable characters and queen itself shown just a little bit 'misunderstood'.Being a Disney flick, it's undoubtedly a musical and all the tracks were so good that you could shake a leg to it. Wonderfully animated characters accompany the music which makes it a audio-visual treat. The characters themselves had enough personality to pull you through the narrative from start to end. The snowman Olaf was exceedingly hilarious and somehow reminded me of Sid from Ice Age.When I watched Tangled, I was bowled over with the visual quality, it had rich environments filled with colorful and well animated characters. Frozen was almost on par with it on the animation and graphical quality but somehow looked bland. Blame the snow, white and blue shades that saturated the locales it was slightly less visual than Tangled. But then again there was this particular scene where a character lift up another and the look and texture of fabric on the characters looked so absolutely fantastic that I forgot I was watching an animated movie. I know it could be just me, but I am glad I felt so and RIGHT THERE there an animated movies wins!In the end, Frozen, came as a surprise coz I wasn't interested when I saw the previews and I was less fascinated coz I was getting this instead of a Tangled sequel. But I am glad to say that I was pleasantly amused and entertained with Frozen. Kids will love it without doubt, but its a real feat for an animated movie when it can get adults glued to their seats and Frozen does just that.",7,2,4,24 December 2013
A Quiet Place," A Genuinely Disquieting Experience
","A Quiet Place, directed by John Krasinski, is one of the most effective horror movies in recent times. It's a breath of fresh air amidst a genre populated by a slew of disappointments like Insidious The Last Key and the overrated Veronica. A Quiet Place is not exactly what you might expect from an ex-The Office actor and it surprises the bejesus outta you and how. I guess comedy actors turned good horror movie directors are all the jazz these days.The year is 2020 and most of humankind is wiped out by heavily armored, sightless creatures who senses and mauls down anything that makes the slightest sound. One of the surviving families, The Abbots, leads their lives in extreme caution. The father, Lee (John Krasinski) makes sure everybody's safe by taking utmost care in not making a sound regardless of what they do. His pregnant wife Emily (Emily Blunt), the deaf daughter Regan (Millicent Simmonds) and sons, Marcus (Noah Jupe) and Beau tread on their father's trail making sure of the same. Things obviously go downhill for them when the baby is on its way and a tragedy that befell them causes more rifts amongst them.Imagine a tense sequence from thriller movies where you'd be holding your breath, clinging onto your seats anticipating something grim, a la 'War Of The Worlds' or Alien's 'Death of Dallas' scene and now imagine a singular tense moment stretched over 90 minutes, that's what A Quiet Place feels like. Nerve-wracking is the right term here. If you've played The Last Of Us' Clicker sequences, you'll have a sketchy idea of what's to be expected from the movie which serves you almost the same for an hour and a half. There were, of course, adorable scenes of the family bonding and fighting like any normal family but in a world like this, things are bound to go awfully wrong. Krasinski does resort to a few jump-scares but it never ruined the movie. A Quiet Place seems to share some with other horror movies and an obvious comparison would be Don't Breathe but its apples and oranges once you've seen A Quiet Place. The creature design was good for what was required for the movie but it did seem a little too Stranger Things-esque. There was little novelty in the design but due to the script and the concept, it felt intimidating enough.In a movie where dialogues are far and few between, performances matter and I have only two thumbs up to how closely knit and real the Abbots feel like. Director and lead, Krasinski himself do a mind-blowing job of portraying Lee with all the nuances. Emily Blunt, his real-life wife, plays Emily and with such wide array of emotions, she is a force to reckon with. Millicent Simmonds stands out playing the daughter Regan and is a superb actor in the making, especially considering she's deaf in real life. Noah Jupe, already having made his mark appearing in Wonder and The Night Manager offers a decent performance as well.It's a feat to have a near full-house of an audience in utmost silence. No annoying popcorn crunches, no disgusting 'movie-commentators', no whispers and not even toddler whimpers and that's exactly how much the A Quiet Place immerses the audience. Part of the immersion was also due to the theatrical experience and it begs to be seen only on the big screen. A Quiet Place might not have been the same experience had it been seen on a smaller screen. The movie owes a lot to its brilliant sound design too. It plays such an integral part in the movie that you will twist and turn in your seat due to the sheer absence of sound. Marco Beltrami's haunting score also paves way for some superb atmosphere.A Quiet Place is one of the more original horror movies to come out in recent times. Original, not in terms of plot but in terms of execution and how Krasinski was able to stretch a paper-thin plot over a thrilling 90 minutes and not losing pace - it's just great. It had been long since a horror movie had gotten full points for being scary. A Quiet Place is not exactly scary, it's an anxiety attack in the making - its tense and it's disturbingly unsettling - a disquieting edge of the seat thriller that I'd urge anybody to go and watch if you haven't already.",9,1,2,29 June 2018
22 Jump Street," A Little Less Original, A Whole lotta Fun!
","Schmidt and Jenko's back and if you thought this is gonna go exactly like that previous reboot, you are oh so right! 21 Jump Street, as I had previously stated, had me in splits, it was one of those movies that genuinely tickled my funny bone. While the 1987 TV show that it was based on was a bit serious and had little humor, the reboot starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum was made to be screamingly hilarious. Thanks to the directors duo Phil Lord and Christopher Miller who also bestowed upon us the brilliant Lego Movie this year, 22 Jump Street is on the same page as 21 Jump Street. It is the same 21 Jump Street formula, rinsed and repeated and the directors takes a jab at it every chance they get and that's exactly why it works.After the successful bust of the high school drug circle in 21 Jump Street, Schmidt and Jenko is sent to college this time to investigate another drug case. Its the same thing all over again but it works out well promising truck loads of fun. The directors addresses this as a sequel-sequel to 21 Jump Street and does almost everything that made the original a terrific comedy. Much of the 80s nostalgic moments from the original is missing here instead the role reversal works out again, this time in favor of Jenko. Even the investigation plays out pretty much same with us as the audiences trying to guess and figure out the whodunnit mystery. Familiar faces pop up here and there and we get hooked on thinking they'd be the culprit, without spoiling anything I'd like to add that the movie does the job fairly well. But of course you are not here to watch a perfect thriller, you are here for the same awkward, goofy moments and NSFW fun from the original and you get that served in plenty.Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum once again shines through as the undercover duo and a lot of bromance is to be found here. They still carries on their terrific chemistry from 21 Jump Street and keeps em coming till end. Even Ice Cube gets extended sequences here and a particular scene with him and Hill was particularly uproarious. On the downside though, I'd say Peter Stormare's screen time wasn't up to the mark, the same goes for the female leads which weren't as compelling as 21 Jump Streets'.21 Jump Street was Pure Comic Gold, and 22 Jump Street is no different. While the first cracked me up, 22 Jump Street still managed to crack me up if not as much as the original. The comedy might not be as hard hitting as 21, many of the sequences may not work as much as the original but 22 Jump Street is still hilarious and if you loved 21 Jump Street you'll be right at home with this one. Wait for the credits to roll and I assure you, you wont repent the 5 minutes you've kept your pee in; just make sure you don't laugh too hard.",7,1,3,15 September 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Too Many Cooks, Yet Again, Spoils the Broth!
","Ah the Hollywood summer time starts and the next 3 months are lined up with some of the most anticipated movies of this year. Don't even get me started on the stars and budget of these flicks, everything seems marketed as the next best thing. From Bryan Cranston's Godzilla and Bryan Singer's X-Men Days of Future Past to Transformers Age of Extinction and Dawn Of Planet of The Apes and then some more. Apparently a separate budget needs to be planned for the same, cutting back some of em. A tough choice indeed.While Sony's decision to reboot Sam Raimi's Spider-Man franchise could be best tagged 'hasty', The Amazing Spider-man garnered enough attention and good critiques that they even green lit its 3rd and 4th sequels, all thanks to Andrew Garfield's portrayal of a 'better' Peter Parker and Marc Webb's direction. Frankly I am a fan of Sam Raimi's original trilogy and as opposed by many, I liked Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker more and maybe . But seems like Garfield's Peter Parker has grown on me and although I initially hated The Amazing Spider-man, I couldn't let go a Spider-man sequel. Just like Marvel's movies, I was bound to watch this and I did in all its splendor in IMAX. I so sorely wanted to add '.and boy, I loved it' but unfortunately it neither had the charm nor the oomph I'd anticipated for.To start things off, we're shown the unfortunate demise of Peter's parents and the movie revolves around the the mysteries involved with the same. But it gets lost amidst Peter and Gwen's mushy romance. I appreciate Marc Webb's expertise with handling romance, as evident from 500 Days of Summer, but it also felt like too much time had been allotted for Peter and Gwen's goofy on and off relationship. It worked well in the comics but on celluloid it felt gratuitous and cheesy. And now let's discuss villains, shall we? What's with Sony and squeezing as much villains as possible in a spidey movie? Don't they know that saying 'Too many cooks spoil the broth or haven't they learnt anything from Spider-man 3? As obvious from the tag 'Rise of Electro', The Amazing Spider-Man 2's main villain is Electro and he would have sufficed for a good movie. But No, Sony just had to squeeze in Green Goblin and Rhino as well, even if it means mere minutes of them. Of the lot, Electro was impressive and tells us to stay away from obsessive 'nobody' like Max Dillon. And by the time he 'rises' to power his fickle-mindness can only matched with his ego and obsession. The Times Square scene in particular was tense, Electro felt like a bomb about to explode and spidey had to play all the right strings to keep him calm.Andrew Garlfield once again dons the Spider-man spandex suit and is bit less annoying than the first. Then again he never felt even remotely threatened by adversaries and on the other hand he seemed more worried and preoccupied with his relationship with Gwen. Weirdly, his performance felt better when he was suited up than not. Emma Stone is a brilliant actor but even she was like this adrenaline junkie who couldn't stay away from Spidey and the antagonists and in the end she just becomes a damsel in distress than anything. Jamie Foxx showcased an electrifying performance as Electro (all puns intended) and even as Max, he was able to convincingly pull off his innocent yet obsessive shades. He was well intimidating as Electro, a worthy contender for Spider-man but thanks to inane script it was never fleshed out. Dane Dehaan is no stranger playing antagonist and does a fair job of playing Harry Osborn/Green Goblin and may even slide into being a formidable villain in the upcoming sequels. Oh and by the way, Paul Giamatti plays Aleksei Sytsevich, a thug-turned-Rhino with a weird Russian which is best left at that.The Amazing Spider-man is surely dark and the weird injection of comedy was another nuance I found. Agreed, Spidey is meant to be a wisecracking superhero, but no superhero would be wisecracking if his or the one he loves' life is at stake, it makes the sequence less tense. And talk about 'being dark', the bodycounts were enormous this time and i can only imagine how much would have been at stake on the Time Square and highway stunts, yet the narrative just goes on not even addressing the grim things that just happened, crowds cheered, people went about their daily lives as if there was absolutely no threat in the horizon.The movie clocks in at a runtime of 142 minutes so good luck if you have a weak bladder. Despite the long runtime it becomes victim to some flimsily edited sequences. Action sequences were abruptly put to stop and there were some transitions where it felt like 'Did the film reel just do a backflip?' Felicia Hardy makes a cameo and could be, hopefully, seen as Black Cat later on in the franchise. The same goes for the excellent end-credit sequence that kept us guessing, leading to speculations of the The Sinister Six.The score from Hans Zimmer and Pharell Williams upped the ante a bit this time able to give that much needed soul which the first lacked. And thanks to the same, Spider-man swinging by gave me goosebumps. I guess its in every fanboy's wishlist to do so and to watch it live in all the IMAX glory, it was nothing short of spectacular.Marc Webb is undoubtedly a skilled director but with no guidance from Marvel I guess he was just as lost as we were. Its time for Marvel to buy back its most beloved character. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 falls into the familiar mediocre territory that its predecessor fell into.",6,2,7,2 May 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," A Hilarious Paint by numbers Superhero movie!
","One would argue that Hollywood is saturated with comic-book movies these days. I wouldn't complain though coz some of the best Hollywood blockbusters came to life from their comic book counterparts. The Dark Knight, Avengers, Sin City, 300 to name a few. But at the same time it does a tad bit tiring when studios like Marvel, Warner Bros and 21st Century Fox dishes out a dozen of these so called superhero movies with 'save the world from the bad guy' premise. Lets keep aside DC for the time being coz it gave us THE best superhero movie of all time, The Dark Knight. Yea, I am a DC fanboy, throw eggs at me, I don't care. Lets talk about Marvel who's on a winning streak since Iron Man, setting up their Phases flawlessly. The Avengers was no doubt, one of the best comic book movies ever made but you gotta agree, some of the Phase One movies that the studio churned out to fill in till the finale just felt like..wellfillers.It bewildered me why Marvel was making a movie on some lesser known galactic superheroes while they could have easily pulled off a Nova Corps, Alpha Flight or an Excalibur movie, hell they could have even gone for X-Factor. While I am fairly positive the aforementioned still might be in the pipeline I frankly thought that Guardians Of The Galaxy would be a quick cashing in before the behemoth release, Avengers Age of Ultron. My skepticism hit the roof when I learnt that James Gunn was directing the movie. No offence, I like the guys' movies, be it the darkly comic, Super or the disgustingly humorous Slither but Gunn isn't what I would call fit for a superhero movie. Turned out I was wrong and his weird humor and direction earned him my respect and admiration for making an Awesome Anti-Avengers movie.Thanks to no Worldwide release I had to wait out a week rummaging through the internet avoiding stumbling upon a Guardians of the Galaxy review/spoiler. But then again I wouldn't lie, storywise Guardians of the Galaxy is a paint by numbers save-the-world story and wouldn't have made a difference even if I had stumbled on some spoilers. But its those these dysfunctional crooks that make magic out of it. This group of outlaws comprising of Starlord, Gamora, Rocket, Groot and Drax is everything you've never expected in a superhero movie and when they team up, it works perfectly. Don't go in expecting an Avengers-esque movie coz you'll be let down coz Guardians of the Galaxy and The Avengers are tonally poles apart, almost. Thanks to James Gunn, the movie promises chuck loads of his signature humour and chockful of action. Amidst all the ruckus you'd almost forget the fact the antagonist is the least bit intimidating, oh yea that's flaw you are likely to look past.I had not thought once, when I'd seen Chris Pratt getting his teeth bashed out by James McAvoy in Wanted, that he'd end up as a main lead in a major studios' production. Chris Pratt was just amazing as Peter Quill aka Star Lord, his comic prowess stood out till end. When I asked one of my friends if he'd liked to go for Guardians of The Galaxy he scoffed saying 'I am not going for movie which has a talking squirrel', I sincerely sympathize with the fellow for addressing so, one of best characters in the movie, Rocket the Raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper. Vin Diesels' Groot was adorable and having just 2 lines through out the movie didn't hurt at all, instead you'll saying it yourself post watching the movie. Zoe Saldana played Gamora and it would have helped to fill in her backstory just a bit more. While I initially questioned Dave Bautista's acting skills, I'd say he did his part well. Surprisingly the leads' packed the same kinda charm the Avengers had on its plate.I tapped my foot every time those soundtracks kicked in. I have a thing for old school music and Guardians of The Galaxy's soundtrack is most definitely my cup of tea. It includes Blue Swede's Hooked On a Feeling which had been a favorite since the Ally McBeal days, plus Redbone's Come and Get Your Love, Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terell's Ain't No Mountain High Enough, 10cc's I'm Not in Love are some of the frequent tracks in my usual playlist.Marvel sure had balls to make a movie on these less notable heroes and an unconventional director and the fact it worked out well amuses me more. Guardians of The Galaxy might not be as epic as The Avengers, but its a surefire entertainer and no comic-book movie fan would say NO to it. I am sure this would have boosted Guardian of The Galaxy comics sales, not to mention filling up Kevin Feige's pockets, but as long as Marvel churns out movies like this, count me in.PS: James Gunn's weird sense of humour came into play once again when the post credit sequence popped up, though take it with just a pinch of salt.",8,5,9,15 September 2014
Evil Dead," Over-rated & Okayish!
","My memories of watching Evil Dead wasn't so good. I saw it when I was a lil kid, tucked under a table and was petrified beyond limits. The horrific images from Sam Raimi's original crept crawling back to my head haunting me till I reached puberty. I thought to give it a second chance and watched it again recently only to be laughing out loud at the twisted humor and appreciating the wonderful effects and imagery that made it a classic. So when I heard they were remaking Evil Dead, my 28 year old self was twice as excited coz by now I was a hardened horror movie enthusiast. Being in India I had the privilege of waiting for more than 3 months since its worldwide release. I realized they were pushing the release date further and further until it was no more in the 'Coming Soon' section. I suspect the ball-less censor board and theatre owners behind this. I couldn't wait for more and albeit the pain of not getting to watch it on the big screen, I ended up watching it on the small screen.2013′s Evil Dead directed by Fede Alvarez and produced by Bruce Campbell kinda falls in between a reboot and a remake. The new Evil Dead is more dark and more on the serious side and kinda avoids the humor that the original had. It feels like its trying hard to scare the crap outta you but myself having watched most of the best horror movies of this gen, it hardly scared me. Think HOSTEL with demons doing most of the torture than humans. Evil Dead is saturated with shocking and gory sequences that'd make most of the people squeamish and run for the nearest restrooms. Just like the original Evil Dead, this one too is filled with bucket loads of gore, gibs and whatever bodily fluids you could imagine though in an excessively exaggerated way. Believe me you won't be scared seeing this, instead it instills dread and disgust. But what it does best is to pay homage to the original and it does it well. It does takes you back to the great horror movies of 80s. Add more makeup effects and less CG, it does bring those nostalgic memories from the yesteryears.Evil Dead is very serious, devoid of the campy humor the original had. The original was very campy which at the time would have been good and I am thankful that this iteration wasn't so. What I liked about the this one is that it had a wee bit backstory. These guys didn't come randomly to the cabin ready to served hot for the demons. The main character Mia was a junkie and she, along with her supportive friends and brother came to the cabin for the sole purpose of detoxing her. As far as the actors were concerned they were just cannon fodder when all hell breaks loose. Seeing enough horror flicks gives you that uncanny ability to let you foresee who's gonna be the first to go and the moment I was introduced to the 5 characters in Evil Dead, I'd known they were all bait for whatever came from the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis. Jane Levy as Mia was the only character who served for some intrigue. Rest was just, as I said, CANNON FODDER.Evil Dead has its advantages being made this-gen. It has some brilliant sound and visuals which screams to be seen on the big screen. I bet the grotesque makeup effects, the creepy forest and all the blood and goo along with the eerie music and ambiance would look and sound ten times better on the big screen. Visually it maintained that essence when I watched it on the small screen as well. Kudos for the cinematography. I felt the chill when I was watching scenes with the forest as the backdrop. It could also be so, coz I was very excited for this one and reading all the rave reviews I was doubly 'turned on' (yea I'm twisted enough that horror entices me :P). But I was extremely disappointed when I'd done watching the movie. If you've seen Cabin in The Woods, you'll know why Evil Dead comes off as tad bit boring. I mean how many Cabin movies have you seen? I watched Evil Dead to scare me as demonly as possible but I wasn't even remotely scared. As mentioned above Evil Dead does one thing best: throw you into constant nostalgia. It reminds you of the good times and not-so-good-times you had watching all those horror flicks when you were young.PS: The post credit sequence wasn't that good either, leaving more unanswered questions.",5,1,2,24 December 2013
Hotel Transylvania," A Genndy Tartakovsky Original!
","Directed by none other than Genndy Tartakovsky, Hotel Transylvania is one of the best animated movies this year. It basically goes on the lines of Monsters Inc and Paranorman, picturing monsters and ghosts more scared of us, Humans, than vice versa. I am glad I went for this one as I am a true blue Genndy Tartovksy fan. I remember watching countless hours of Samurai Jack & Dexter's Laboratory back in the days. And of course who could forget the Star Wars Clone Wars mini series? Hotel Transylvania stars Adam Sandler as Count Dracula who turns out to be an overprotective father running a Hotel for monsters, completely free of Humans and things go outta control when a human wanders into the castle and falls in love with Dracula's daughter Mavis.Adam Sandler and Andy Samberg got a winning duo going on in this after the horrendous 'Thats my Boy'. The memories of that movie still haunts me than the ghosts from this movie. The most fun had in Hotel Transylvania is seeing their characters together in the screen dishing it off, monster magic against human wit. Other monsters as well were voiced splendidly by Kevin James, David Spades and Jon Lovitz. Among them the very Fantastic-Mr-Fox looking-Werewolf 'Wayne' stood out giving some of the best lines voiced wonderfully by Steve Buscemi. And well, lastly, Selena Gomez as Mavis was just meh.Complemented with some very good music tracks from an assortment of artists the film has a Merry mood throughout. Of course towards the end it gets predictable but still the signature Genndy style was seen all over and being a fan I loved it all. I found the scenes where Drac goes postal kinda weird. I don't know how the kids took itbut have to admit it was a wee bit disturbing amidst all the jovial stuff that was going on around. So was all the floating Drac thing.Its a hardcore kids movie but it never says anywhere that an adult cant enjoy the same. I really found my 9 year old self enjoying it way too much. Had I seen it at least 10 years back I would have loved it even more. Though seems a sequel is in the making and I have crossed my fingers for it nonetheless.",8,1,3,14 December 2012
Sinister," A Drab Affair!
","Sinister, I was told, was original and one of the scariest movies this season. I am severely disappointed after what I saw. First of all lemme get this out: 'What the bloody F did I just watch?' It wasn't even remotely scary, it had inevitable jump scares which fell flat as well as flawed monster closets. Nothing in the movie ever worked well for it. The plot is disastrous. To begin with The Bagul didn't even exist in any mythology. They do say some mumbo-jumbo about some Pagan Deity but sadly it doesn't make any sense nor does it add to the scare factor. They just made it up and usually these imaginative stuff from the film-makers does work, but Bagul is so awfully garish, so unimaginative that it fails on so many levels. I saw in forums that Bagul was being compared to to Slenderman which was 10 times scarier. There is nothing scary about an entity with pale make-up (who seemed like The Crow and WWE's Kain had a lovechild) who just does nothing than be shown in random shots. Hell, Slenderman did a much better job just doing nothing! Over-rated, entirely predictable, vastly tasteless with vague characters and an uninteresting plot, Sinister is one movie you'd want to stay away from.",4,1,3,14 December 2012
12 Years a Slave," As close as it can get to the Dark days!
","Oppression, Slavery and the likes had always carved its niche in Hollywood and it has undoubtedly earned its position so, thanks to wonderful movies like Amistad, Glory, Lincoln and the more recent Django Unchained. Often coming off as powerful dramas, it was never a subject to be taken lightly unless its something from Quentin Tarantino where he injected his own style in Django Unchained. Steve McQueen's 12 Years a Slave, based on the memoir of the same name, tells the story of Solomon Northup, a respected freeman who gets tricked, drugged and kidnapped into being a slave for 12 years.Unlike McQueen's previous movies, 12 Years a Slave can be enjoyed by a casual moviegoer. Its a straight to the point drama; something I had not expected from McQueen. I do enjoy his movies, and although not a huge fan, both Hunger and Shame had its own place in my best movies of the year list. Handling racism and other sensitive issues, 12 Years a Slave could have gone too crazy and some sequences had too but it is the hard truth and 12 Years a Slave doesn't shy away from showing you how gruesome and cruel things really were. If you can't tolerate a representation of things that comes close to genuine history then this isn't for you either. Previously in movies we were introduced characters who were born-slaves but here in 12 Years a Slave we get to see a freeman circumstantially becoming a slave and we get to see the contrast clearly. It is shocking at times, a constant air of dread suspended from start to end and yet making you wonder there'd be something pleasant at the end of that dark tunnel.12 Years a Slave stars a wide array of AAA stars. Chiwetel Ejiofor is inexplicably good as Solomon, his helplessness, his craving to get back to his family, everything had been acted out perfect. Michael Fassbender plays Edwin Epps and this guy is really becoming one of the most dynamic actors of our times. Already a McQueen favorite and having acted in both Hunger and Shame, Fassbender's Epps is one of the most spiteful characters I've seen on screen and to imagine the character was indeed real, just EVIL. Paul Giamatti, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, Sarah Paulson, Brad Pitt also livens up the screen although their screentimes, debatable. I was so impressed with Lupita Nyong'o performance, it almost felt like she wasn't even acting; arguably one of the best debut performances of 2013.McQueens trademark extended scenes makes a comeback. I was amused to see Michael Fassbender jog for a good 2 minutes in Shame, while at the time it felt both odd and intriguing, it's one of the scenes I remember even now. 12 Years a Slave packs a number of memorable scenes and one among them: an extended sequence of 'the protagonist left hanging on a rope and dearly clinging on for his life' will be remembered the same way the jogging scene from Shame. Brownie points goes for the cinematography where certain visual cues were left to tell a lot. For most times Hans Zimmer's score does wonders but I felt it a bit misplaced here nonetheless the title theme reminded me of 'Time' from Inception.12 Years a Slave's inevitable and imminent comparison would be to Django Unchained but believe me when I say both of them are poles apart. Of course the sheer dread of slavery has been portrayed in both but its the scenes in 12 Years a Slave that'll stick with you years from now than Django's. While Django Unchained entertained me, 12 Years a Slave made me uncomfortably shrug in my seat that makes it one of last year's powerful dramas.",8,0,2,19 April 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Two Thumbs Up!
","Ever had the urge to drive fast after watching a Fast & Furious movie? If you are on the page as me, then beware, The Wolf of Wall Street might make you wanna jump start a career in investment. It is exactly what the protagonist Jordan Belfort motivated his accomplices to do in it. There is always something that you could (not proudly) relate to in a Scorsese movie and in The Wolf of Wall Street its about money and who wouldn't love to relate to it.The Wolf of Wall Street tells the rise of Jordan Belfort, a man with high ambitions and even higher exuberance, how he conquers the stock market, goes over the top and more. This could be considered a rags to riches story and the narrative takes a turn after the second act when the riches phase goes a notch above and becomes greed, power and eventually an inevitable descent. When you are this far down the rabbit hole there ain't no coming back to the surface, unscathed at least. A movie with excessive nudity, sleaze and drug use, The Wolf of Wall Street is exactly how its meant to be and Martin Scorsese has done a job which takes its justified crown at the box office and most likely even at the Oscars. One of the strong points of the movie is humor and Wolf of Wall Street packs it in tons. This is by far Scorsese's funniest movie till date that I developed a cramp in my stomach laughing so much.The Wolf of Wall Street is about 3 hours long and not once did I feel an impatient bladder, I was rooted to the seat eager to know where Jordan was going with it. Agreed Jordan Belfort is not guy you'd want your kids looking up to and his ways are never strictly speaking legal. But despite that you want this guy to emerge at the top for his ambitions, this character is as fun as it can get and who brought life to Jordan? Leonardo Di Caprio of course! This is maybe his 6th collab with Martin Scorsese and you have to owe it to them, they do make a dynamic duo. Leonardo despite his charismatic and magnetic performance in his recent movies never landed him an Academy Award but who cares? He has proved that he is one of the greatest actors of our times who literally steals every scene he's in. For once I wanted to step back from the cosmetic layer of Jordan's pompous life and have a different angle at his ways. But Leonardo Di Caprio's performance was just so captivating and he just didn't give me a chance, there was no stepping back when you have delved this much into being entertained.A stellar supporting cast promises that the screen is always filled with intriguing characters. Jonah Hill especially is a force to reckon with as Jordan's most trusted Donnie. This guy has become the go to guy for brilliant supporting roles and is getting increasingly entertaining, starring in almost all of the Academy Award nominated movies. This is indeed a boy's club where there's little importance for feminine characters and I felt the their roles in the movie were objectified. Of course it'd be Pan Am's Margot Robbie's nude scenes that'd be the talk of the day after watching this movie and it is indeed hard to take your eyes off her but you have to admit it takes a splendid performance to be noticed when you've got a star studded male cast to compete with. Matthew McConaughey, Jean Dujardin, Kyle Chandler and Jon Bernthal equally deserves a thumbs up for their short but memorable roles.Its impossible to deduce how Martin Scorsese had done it. The man's edging over his 70s and has crafted a movie so modern, so energetic and with so much passion that even a younger director would be challenged to top it. I really don't care how he is being criticised for his apparent sleazy glorification of the stockbrokers or for the 506 F-bombs thats been dropped in the whole movie. He just delivered another masterpiece, an edge of the seat dramedy that is on par with most of the his as well as others' best movies ever. I enjoyed every frame of it and was left wanting more. Relentlessly funny, loud & ceaselessly crazy, The Wolf of Wall Street in undeniably one of the best movies of 2013 and is by far the best time I had at the movies in recent times.",9,7,12,19 April 2014
The Conjuring," A severely over-rated disappointment,
","James Wan once again returns to his Horror roots directing back to back horror movies with The Conjuring closely followed by Insidious Chapter 2. 2011′s Insidious was undeniably one of the biggest horror movies of the year and I absolutely enjoyed it . Even to the point that I started recommending it to people. Insidious had atmospheric horror, and it had almost everything going for it, everything except a lackluster ending which it had to include for an obvious sequel. Nonetheless James Wan knows his movies; be it Saw, Dead Silence or Death Sentence, entertainment is guaranteed. His latest offering The Conjuring is nothing but a haunted house movie albeit following the 'old wine new bottle' routine. If you are horror movie fan you'll instantly feel in familiar territory here. We've had more than a handful of them, the best being The Amityville Horror, The Haunting, The Shining, Poltergeist, the list goes on. So what's new here? Actually nothing, as soon as the middle-class family moves into their new house, you know things are gonna get awry. It starts off with a very slow first act and they dump all the noisy, in-your-face stuff towards the finale as the demons and violent spirits takes a toll. I'd been hearing a lot of positive reviews about this one, some even quoting that its one of the scariest movies ever to hit the screen or even that the visuals will be stuck in your head making you paranoid with every creak you hear in your house post-watching this. I can't say the same though, yes it did give me jolts and ample amounts of anxiety but the visuals just didn't have any effect on me. I forgot about it as soon as I came outta the theater. There are a lot of memorable scenes though made possible with some fantastic camera work. I suppose I had my expectations way too high reading those rave reviews which made my experience so .so yeah even this one could be hampering your experience should you choose to watch the movie. The plot-direction is one among the high points here, balancing the events from both families, The Perrons who are the victims of the haunting and The Warrens who are the ghost hunters. Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston as the Perrons did convincing acting. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as Lorraine and Ed Warren delivered splendid performances. Vera, being my favorite from The Orphan and loads of other movies, was no less impressive here. The kids were another addition to the brilliant casting, there were five of them and it seemed too much of a crowd initially but the ones who were terrified victims and dragged to the end did an astounding job, among them Joey King who played a younger version of Talia in The Dark Knight Rises gave a noteworthy performance here as Christine. Ah well now the about the unholy beings, they were terrifying indeed, thanks to good makeup and less-screen time. James Wan did go for the right amount of 'the less you see the more you'll be scared' formula and it did do wonders. There was this particularly awesome scene which involves one perched atop a cupboard. Clearly haunted house horror genre aren't my cup of tea unless its another Cabin in The Woods which had tons of novelty (yet again I wouldn't call it scary). I was more scared of twitchy otherworldly beings like Mama, Samara from The Ring or the ones from The Grudge but for others though, The Conjuring might just satiate their terrifying needs as evident from the pretty lady behind me who kept gasping more than needed. The Conjuring is a well directed, brilliantly acted horror movie with mild scares that could be enjoyed the same at home with a good pair of headphones. As for me I'm gonna wait for Insidious Chapter 2 and see if its got some real scares.",6,0,0,24 December 2013
Wonder Woman," Let's Trash DC!
","'I know it's a misleading title but hold your horses if you're a DC fanboy and want to rain down upon me a slew of abuses. Hear me out first.'Oh DCEU, you keep churning out mediocre movies and boast of box office returns as a reason to shove down more mediocrity down our throats. Although I loved Man Of Steel (coz I am sucker for Supes) we need to digest the fact that mediocrity in movies and encouraging and supporting them has only made DCEU to not push any envelope. Its no news that Marvel, despite their kiddy-friendly, formulaic movies, is at the top of their game and catching up to them is a feat for DC. If they really want to do that they would have to invest time in fleshing out characters in solo movies than dump a ton in one movie trying to get ahead of the race.I stopped rooting for DCEU after the third strike that was: Suicide Squad, it was a serviceable movie but has only disappointed me further after the ambitious yet disastrous Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. And this made me genuinely skeptic going in for Wonder Woman. Going against all odds, Wonder Woman had a gargantuan task on its shoulders to come out as at least 'amply entertaining'. Suffice to say, despite its weak screenplay and a flashy 3rd act, Wonder Woman is a winner and much more than being just 'entertaining'.Directed by Patty Jenkins, Wonder Woman soars above all the other DCEU movies. It was a low bar to clear when it comes to DC movies but its a superbly cast, well directed comicbook movie staying almost true to its roots. Jenkins had to fight to make the movie the way she wanted it to be made. Being an origin movie and one which was never on celluloid format before, Wonder Woman does it just right. Tonally, it feels very different from the other DC movies we've seen so far when it came to composition, color balance, and the inclusion of Diana-centric battle scenes like the iconic No Man's Land scene. It's indeed a feat since the studio had been breathing down the creator's necks, strangling their creative liberty. Did I mention that Wonder Woman also has humour? Yes, you heard it right, a DCEU movie with chuckle-worthy, non-corny moments which isn't forced as well. I am going to give a blind eye to whomever compares it to Captain America The First Avenger. Apart from the genre and the war setting, there isn't much similarities between the two. Apples & Oranges, people! I'd be treading on spoiler territory so I won't tell what they've done, but DC had the balls to do what Marvel never did (you'll know it when you're done with the movie).Despite my initial skepticism, Gal Gadot embodies Wonder Woman almost flawlessly or at least appearance-wise. Its hard to take your eyes off her when she's onscreen. She shined in her fish-outta-water sequences in London and she nailed it in the well choreographed action sequences on the frontline. Like Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark or Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, its tough to imagine anybody else but Gal in Wonder Woman's shoes for a while. I am sold on Gal playing Wonder Woman. Chris Pine still proves that he's still the best Chris in the industry. I had my doubts on his Steve Trevor character before watching the movie, but he proves to be the best addition that actually lends a lot of heart to the movie Like they say, 'behind every successful woman there is a...wait, wasn't it the other way around...my bad! And its no surprise that Robin Wright aced it as Diana's Amazonian badass aunt, Antiope. Both Elena Anaya and Danny Houston might have shared a little more than 20 minutes screen time with decent performances from both but it wouldn't have hurt to flesh out their characters more, especially Elena's Dr. Poison.As for the cons, among loose threads aplenty, it is still a 'save-the-world' narrative that we have seen a million times before. Yes, they've got the Wonder Woman character 'almost' right but that doesn't essentially make a great movie. Gal Gadot is indeed a breath of fresh air, a sight for sore eyes but the same cant be said about her acting chops. Agreed, she's new to all of this but she has a long way to go. Another major flaw is something that had also been haunting Marvel movies since day one: weak antagonists. Its tough to raise major stakes when its a superhero movie and although the antagonists in Wonder Woman tries hard to make a kebab outta the world, the lead villain is not even mildly intimidating whom still doesn't look like a menace Wonder Woman cant handle. Also that 3rd act was very reminiscent of Batman Vs Superman's loud and flashy finale, which was another weak point strikingly in contrast with a very colorful Thermyscra-based first act and a grim yet exciting battle-heavy second act.Movie scores are something I have grown listening to and humming to all my life. Sadly, Rupert Gregson William's Wonder Woman score doesn't live up to the movie's visuals. I'd say its ridden with the same flaw as Marvel's score, its sounded generic. The only bits that was exciting was when the movie used Hans Zimmer's original Wonder Woman theme from Batman Vs Superman and that definitely gave me goosebumps.I'll be frank, I havent read much Wonder Woman comics and like many, I was seasoned to macho-superheroes. I loved her in the Justice League tv show, 2009's animated movie (which is brilliant) and Batman Vs Superman yet I was someone who preferred wearing Superman/Batman tees to Wonder Woman tees. Today, I am glad that Wonder Woman is not just an epic win for DC it is also the first female-directed, female lead superhero movie that every comicbook fan had been waiting for aeons. It's success marks the confidence of female-lead movies in a skeptic, masculine-lead Hollywood. It also ups the ante for superhero 'solo' movies. Whether it was planned or not, just like the post's banner says 'Justice Begins With Her', Wonder Woman proves to be the one who should lead the upcoming Justice League movie. Warner Bros might want to put their merchandize-selling, flying rodent-suited mascot on the back burner for their next outing.All said and done, I hope DC and WB doesn't become all smug with one blockbuster in the pockets and continue its race with Marvel. So yea, let's trash DC if they follow this good movie up with more loud, mediocre, CGI-heavy movies.",8,2,2,29 June 2018
The Wolverine," Back to Basics!
","Wolverine is one of the iconic characters in both the Marvel Universe as well as the 20th Century Fox's movies; so is his Adamantium claws and healing factor. An immortal and living through ages he does have a lot of stories ready to be told through movies/comics. We did get an Origin movie, X-Men Origins Wolverine which was panned by critics and audiences alike. But I felt it was trashed more than it deserved to be. It had loads of action and bits from the original Wolverine Origin story arc but it did trash the character for the sake of being an action-heavy summer blockbuster. A weak script, irrelevant characters and a stupid take on 'the merc with a mouth' underwhelmed the audiences. Anyways The Wolverine salvages some of its lost prestige putting a lot of focus on the core character.Rumors that Darren Aronofsky'd be helming the new Wolverine had me excited but the director's chair was handed over to James Mangold in the end. I am not skeptic at all regarding Mangold's directing prowess, as evident from gems like 3:10 to Yuma, Walk the line and Identity. But I was wondering how he'd handle a superhero flick. After watching it, its safe to say Mangold's direction is far better than what I'd expected it to be.The Wolverine is undoubtedly based on Frank Miller's take on the superhero and I was already familiar with the names Mariko, Shingen and Yukio. It all came like a whiff of fresh air. The Wolverine is sort of a reboot for the series and a brilliant stepping stone for a new franchise which could tell a parallel story to the X-Men movies. Although it has its roots attached to the previous flicks, we are dropped into the midst of Wolverine's story. There ain't no origin, there ain't no 'Previously'; instead we are just dropped into a narrative which ploughs forward to the thick of Japan. The Wolverine could be compared to treatment our superheros been getting recently. He's been stripped off his healing factors and he is left like so almost the entire movie and it does bring out some tension. I mean when he had the healing power, we knew he wouldn't just die even if she's split into two (admit it!)The Wolverine is directed well and so was it well written and the action sequences well choreographed but its not without its flaws though. As mentioned above The Wolverine still has the debris it's carried on from X-Men The Last Stand and I wasn't pleased with it. Wolverine has flashbacks of his lost love? Seriously? Isn't it time his healing factor took care of that already? I mean its the god-damn Wolvie we're talking about here. Jean Grey's flashbacks (more like boring nightmares and more than once) kept crawling into the plot disrupting the pace and I just didn't like it. Of course Wolverine is tormented from what he'd done in the past but that doesn't mean, we the audience need to be tormented from start to end. The Japan setting was a bit distracting as well and maybe thats a personal thing. I am not a big fan of Martial arts movies and there was an excess of martial arts settings and jargon here in the movie though it all did look good. Props were fantastic and the action sequences thick, especially the Bullet Train sequence is something to gape at.Hugh Jackman effortlessly steps into his Wolverine shoes for the 6th time and having worked with Mangold in Kate & Leopold did wonders for The Wolverine. This is the Logan we've all praised and been used to and Hugh easily slides into the role and storyline straight from X-Men The Last Stand albeit forgetting X-Men Origins Wolverine. But then again playing Wolverine would have become second instinct for Hugh by now. Supporting cast couldn't be praised for the same, most of them being just bait for the plot. Especially Wolverine love interest in the movies, I felt they had absolutely no chemistry. Rila Fukushima did an absolutely splendid job playing Yukio. I had huge expectations for Svetlana Khodchenkova who played the only other mutant in the movie, Viper but she just served for some eyecandy and wasn't even fleshed up to be a proper antagonist.For what its worth, The Wolverine is a splendid action movie which concentrates more on the character and the plot than heavy heavy action sequences. If you are an X-Men/Wolverine fan you are gonna love it and please do stay back after the credits coz there is a monumental end- credit to be seen there.",7,21,43,24 December 2013
Thor: The Dark World," A Hairy ordeal that is less Epic nonetheless fun!
","If there ever was one character from The Avengers that I was least interested in, that'd be.(No not HawkEye, cmon give that guy a break) Thor. Yes the Asgardian Odinson, the God of Thunder. And blame that on the 2010 movie Thor. Compared to other Marvel movies at the time, I found Thor to be lackluster. There was action, there were epic set- pieces, there was fish-outta-water comedy and most of all was the origin story of Thor and Loki who'd be seen more in the upcoming The Avengers. But while Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk set the perfect stage for The Avengers, Thor's origin story faltered at it. I could only see it as a companion piece to the Marvel Phase One and nothing else.Directed by Alan Taylor, who's directed a whole bunch of HBO Shows, Thor The Dark World's story takes place in Asgard and London, presumably coz New York was still in ruins post the incidents from The Avengers. And our world's once again at stake, all thanks to the Dark Elf Malekith and Thor is instinctively called upon by Jane Foster who, of all the people, stumbles on the very thing Malekith wantssome gooey evil thing called the Aether. We are once again counting on Thor to save the day (or save Jane). Thor The Dark World is as drab as the original but I was impressed with the pacing of the movie. It had a lot of fun moments as well touchy drama sprinkled around. Usually I'd be taking mental notes when the movie gets drab but Thor The Dark World didn't give a chance for that. Was it coz the movie was that good? NO! Was it entertaining? YES! I was constantly thrown around from one set piece to another. The movie also cleverly manages to incorporate several nods to The Avengers and its upcoming sequel as well S.H.I.E.L.D., as the story progressed.Chris Hemsworth once again dorns his Asgardian armor and cape as the Thor and he was very much in character and makes me wonder if he's always so. Then again, having seen his Red Dawn, I need not raise a bet. I was not a Loki fan, neither in Thor nor in The Avengers. But here he was just mind blowing. I'd say this one is one of his finest performances ever. A real show stealer! And a particular scene with a grief stricken Loki showed every bit of it. An immediate comparison would be to Heath Ledger's Joker but we all know that ain't so.To my surprise, the gorgeous Natalie Portman, once again takes up the role of Jane Foster. Is she being a good Samaritan not leaving the role for somebody else? Or is she really rooting to play the role again? An actress of such caliber does need her own break and I suppose Jane Foster makes for a wonderful one. Christopher Eccleston plays Malekith with admirable sincerity but I felt his character was severely underwritten and towards the end he felt lesser and lesser intimidating.Kat Dennings is just plain annoying. I don't know why. Despite the few smirks that her Darcy delivered, she felt more like a character which was being dragged onto this one just coz she was there in the first one. Other notable roles include Zachary Levi's Fandral, Idris Elba's Heimdall and an old but exceptionally well-acted Odin by Anthony Hopkins. And btw I feel Jaimie Alexander would make a spectacular Diana (Wonder Woman).If you can forgive the weak story and its tendency to inject humor at odd moments, Thor The Dark World is thoroughly enjoyable and will be entertaining even for people not keeping up with the Marvel Phases. I for one, was glad that as a stand alone movie, it entertains and excels more than its predecessor.PS: Stay back for two shawarmas after the credits roll.",Null,2,3,24 December 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Packing the right amount of drama and action
","While the market's saturated with Vampire romances (hiding its shades of abstinence, cheesy romance and what not), The Hunger Games took a leap forward introducing a bloody albeit sensible saga for the teens. Much more serious in its presentation, Suzanne Collins has written a trilogy both teens and adults can enjoy and the movies based on it are just as good. As evident from the first Hunger Games, Catching Fire is no different and it doesn't disappoint the least. I know I am late, I watched this movie like 2 weeks back and then I was caught in a Smaug- sized void.Helmed by Francis Lawrence of Constantine and I Am Legend fame, Catching Fire continues where the original left off, we are introduced to a very disturbed and vulnerable Katniss Everdeen having hallucinations post her first Hunger Games. And just when you thought everything would be fine and well for her, it gets worse when 75th Hunger Games starts, also known as Quarter Quell. The first act of the movie was lush with characters new and old, setting things in motion leading to its finale in Mockingjay Parts 1 and 2. It did have a slow pace but it was captivating enough to make you feel that Panam and its politics were real. It does a very good job of showing the totalitarian capital and the undemocratic ways its politics goes.Of course it all gets unarguably thrilling when the Hunger Games starts and it does get the adrenaline pumping. Our hapless heroes and their formidable foes are put head to head against all kinda new threats and it does make you wonder 'May the odds be ever in your favor, Seriously?' Katniss and Peeta's bond goes stronger throughout the Games and it all ends in a cliffhanger and a rather intriguing one at that. It keeps you wanting more.Jennifer Lawrence, indisputably, comes off as a winner here. She might not grab another Oscar for role but the way this girl acts is just jaw- droppingly convincing and yes, she was indeed a sight for sore eyes. Elizabeth Banks was annoying but i suppose she was written that way. Woody Harrelson, without surprise, steals every scene he was in whereas Donald Sutherland on the other hand felt nefarious beyond limits. Instead of Wes Bentley's Seneca Crane, Philip Seymour Hoffman shares the screen as the new Gamemaker and showing off some good performance as well.IMHO, Catching Fire got way too dark and I sometimes questioned myself if the fiction was intended for teens. I was not too happy with the weird love triangle tension between Katniss, Peeta and Gale. It remains to see how Mockingjay would end up, its safe to say in Francis' hands its off to a good start.",7,0,11,24 December 2013
Godzilla," A Remarkable Reboot from Gareth Edwards
","Godzilla, a legend that rhymes with the celebrated monsters of all time, the likes of King Kong and Frankenstein. Of all the summer blockbusters, Gareth Edward's Godzilla would undoubtedly be among the top. The previews were haunting and thrilling enough to build hype. The anticipation it'd built is understandable, considering Roland Emmerich's very mediocre Godzilla. Almost 15 years after, this years iteration had loads of promises to keep and going in for the movie I had my hopes way too high like any other Godzilla fan. And without further ado, I'd like to say I was satiated.I was welcome to a customized IMAX intro which served as a great node to the monster in question and then to a scene where Ken Watanabe's character, Dr. Ichiro Serizawa travels to Philippines to investigate a mysterious incident, the shots constantly reminded me of a movie from the past decade, from the aerial views of a copter to Ichiro's hat. Had John William's score been playing in the background I would have mistaken it for Jurassic Park. Shortly after, we are introduced to Bryan Cranston's Joe Brody working in an Atomic plant in Tokyo and there on it served a heavy dose of the grim things that was about to come. While the characters are well written, it takes a long long time to get to the juicy bits. But believe me, your first glimpse of Godzilla will be well worth the slow burn and the tension thus built and works very much in favor of the over all tone of the movie. The humongous beast himself is a sight to behold when he makes his appearance, hulking over buildings like a true god. The monster's design stays true to its roots, albeit with all intricate details, as opposed to its redesign in Emmerich's Godzilla which seemed like a giant Iguana. I'll leave the details for you to experience it for yourself.Gareth Edwards was a brilliant choice as the director and Godzilla shares a similar style with his previous movie, Monsters. He has done what Christopher Nolan did with Batman. Rooting the characters in a believable world that we could all relate to. He was able to achieve the tension and dread as well as the impending fate of humanity and then leading to an amazing, jaw-dropping monster scuffle finale.A charismatic Bryan Cranston plays Joe Brody, a grief torn husband who won't stop at anything to find the mysterious atomic plant calamity that killed his wife. I was surprised as there was no applause seeing Cranston on screen, after all he was our favorite Walter White. His performance was awe inspiring and demanded nothing less than a standing ovation. Later on we are introduced to Aaron Johnson, Brody's son, and initially felt fine for the role though later on it seemed like he was in no hurry and felt a bit bland for the role. The world, his wife and kid's lives are at stake and this guy is acting all super cool. Elizabeth Olsen played Aaron's wife and while she had a good presence her absence wouldn't have made much difference either. Ken Watanabe displayed a good performance, but nothing to write home about.Let's get onto the bad bits now. There were these sequences where the monsters would be on a full on collision course and guess what? It'd be shown on a teeny TV screen in snippets .What?! I mean saving the best for the finale always seems like a good idea, but only on paper. It might work well for an indie/TV movie like Monsters but for a movie with a gargantuan budget like this, it was a tad bit disappointing. I understand Gareth was focusing on all the drama but being a fanboy I would have loved to see more Godzilla and MUTO going head to head. It takes over a whopping 60 minutes to have a glimpse of Godzilla and till then we had to sit through the human drama. It was so severely trying not to be Pacific Rim by injecting more drama and less monster brawl. This is where Pacific Rim won, it was all about the Robots vs Giant Monsters, yes it was pure style over substance but yes it was also what I had asked and paid for. Alexandre Desplat's score was well synced with the visuals capturing tension and haste in equal proportions, but at times, felt a bit subtle as well.1998′s Godzilla was in no means an intolerable movie, it had loads of monster action topped with another ton of cheese and my own 5th grade self had loved it at the time. But being a grown up I found way too many flaws to love it as much as I had back then. Gareth's Godzilla is much more dark in tone and leaves no room for cheese or humor and instead its a huge step up from its predecessor. Huge credits should go for the visual effects team making the monsters believably enthralling. This is almost a perfect reboot for the franchise which has some much needed heart and drama.",7,1,8,17 May 2014
Looper," Time Travel For Dummies!
","Directed by Rian Johnson, Looper, stars Joseph Gordon Levitt & Bruce Willis in the lead along with Emily Blunt. It is without doubt one of the best sci-fi movies this year. The one thing I loved about Looper is the unconventional attention to the plot. Unlike other sci-fi movies you are not welcome to JUST beefy visuals and eye-candy which diverts your attention away from the plot. There's not much 'sci-fi bling' in Looper, instead you are greeted to brilliant writing and awesome dialogues. From the very first scene the plot manages to cling on to you and immerses you.Don't be alarmed when I say its all story and less action, there's plenty of action sequences and rather meaty ones at that. Once again though these sequences invests more emotionally in you than just being set-piece moments and adrenaline rushes that you forget once you leave the movies. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's constant narration of the things he end up doing kept things slick like noir-pulp. His makeup to resemble Bruce Willis was totally uncalled for. It's not the Joseph we've seen in his recent flicks, literally! But you end up buying it anyway. And even with those layers of prosthetics and cosmetics you have to give it to Joseph to portray a believable young Bruce Willis. And about Bruce Willis, he had some good scenes as well as some mediocre ones which felt like he'd warped from his Die Hard days. Emily Blunt kinda stole some limelight from the male leads, her character was well written and arrayed with an abundance of emotions.Another thing I loved is the comprehensible accounting of time travel and events linked to it. Usually when time travel is involved you need to rack up your brains (*cough* LOST *cough*) but here in Looper everything is explained as simple and pleasantly plausible. There are plot holes of course but none that's too tangible and never the ones breaking your discernment of the over-all plot. The loopholes in Looper have been covered up subtly and to some extent giving justifications to each and every time-travel jargon. It could be just lame and just some words strung together but that actually saves the causalities that arises from time travel.Apart from all this Looper has some pacing issues towards the 3rd act. One moment I felt I was thrown in a time-jumping mob war and the next I was thrown amidst a supernatural-family-drama. An absence of an enjoyable soundtrack also takes away some brownie points.Rian Johnson's signature style has been smeared all over Looper. A bit of 'Brothers Bloom' and 'Brick' could be seen throughout the movie. I found it stylish, cool and totally plot-oriented. Rian proves that a time-travel movie need not be convoluted nor ambiguous, or laid with brain-teasers that keeps you thinking after you leave the movie theater. Looper is quite an entertainer and one of the better made time-travel movies ever made, something you could watch and drive home without burdening your brain asking 'how come', 'why this' and 'why that.'",8,0,1,14 December 2012
Cloud Atlas," Ambitious & Awesome!
","It was way back in 1999 'The Matrix' hit the screen, directed by the Wachowskis when they were still 'brothers'. The Matrix blew me away when I saw it and it still does. The movie just questions your whole existence, it really made you ask yourself: 'Are we really living in a Matrix?'. Even last week I read an article on IGN that scientists were still researching on the topic. The Matrix sets a milestone for CG in movies too, especially the revolutionary Bullet-time which had been used and over-used ever since. It was something you'd never seen in movies before and I still find The Matrix a technical marvel. The Wachowskis went off the grid for a while and gave us the splendid 'V for Vendetta' (written, not directed) and the less noteworthy 'Speed Racer'. Tom Tykwer is another director who bestowed upon us another classic 'Perfume The Story of a Murderer'. If you've seen it, and I suggest that you do if you haven't, you'll know that he's a true blue story-teller. Who'd have thought their next project would be 'Cloud Atlas', an adaptation of David Mitchell's book of the same name. Cloud Atlas is an anthology of six interwoven stories spanning through ages and aeons and was considered to be un-filmable until now and you'll know exactly why, when are you done watching the movie. This is not a good choice for casual movie goers although for those who have read the book it's a real treat. It's sci-fi-adventure-drama-comedy all squeezed into one remarkable, brain-stimulating movie.Cloud Atlas stars Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Ben Winshaw, Jim Sturgess, Hugo Weaving, Doona Be, Hugh Grant, Susan Sarandon and I really hope I haven't missed out on any. With an all-star cast of who's- who of Hollywood rather crammed in all six stories, it both delivers an array of awesome performances and confuses the viewer. Confuses as in, Cloud Atlas is more nested than interwoven; the stories take place inside stories and it does not move progressively rather it keeps pushing you into one narrative then taking you back to another and then back to another only to be diverted back to the very first. The cast here is directed to play different characters in each segment and the characters need not be connected at all. So when you see Tom Hanks play Zachry in one segment as a protagonist, he plays the malicious antagonist Dr. Henry Goose in another which actually keeps you thinking: 'Is there really a connection between the two?' After-all the viewers can't be blamed because the tagline of the movie itself suggests that 'Everything is Connected'. There are some gratuitous use of make-up and I found it rather distracting than appealing. Nonetheless the actors themselves got a good chance at displaying how dynamic they could be in each segment. While Tom Hanks' characters not-surprisingly stole the show, Ben Winshaw's composer character was really intriguing, Doona Be's Sonmi-451 with her tiny eyes did more acting than any in the futuristic segment, while Jim Sturgess' Adam Ewing all by himself ran his own segment. You see it's just difficult to quote who's performance was better not spoiling the narrative but I found Jim Broadbent's 'Timothy Cavendish' to be the most entertaining, incorporating comedy and drama to his section breaks the tense narratives that it was enclosed in.The editing is splendid in terms of what they have achieved here and it's also to be blamed for the cobwebby sequences intertwining and strangling you into the narratives. As a result you rarely invest your emotions in one character and maybe that's what the directors wanted too. The film initially crafts each characters outlook which takes its own sweet time and takes pace towards the 2nd act and from there its smooth sailing leading to a much enjoyable pay-off. I loved how they've sewn together tense sequences as well as emotional sequences. Add to that a range of absolutely spellbinding scores that compliments each string of sequences that wraps the package pulling the right strings and keys to touch your emotions. I loved 'All Boundaries are Conventions' is a more pleasant track. Clocking close to 3 hours it definitely tests your bladder but I was not bored even once. Sometimes I thought certain narratives would never get anywhere but a sequence in the narrative changes everything in an unexpected turn of events that leads to the aforementioned sweet payoff.In all its grandeur, Cloud Atlas is a commendable adaptation of something considered to be un-adaptable to the celluloid. It's a flawed but ambitious movie. It's thought-provoking and will work up emotions. I consider it to the likes of Darren Aronofsky's 'The Fountain'. Where 'The Fountain' spanned centuries with 3 intertwining story lines with 2 titular characters, Cloud Atlas went up a notch incorporating a slew of actors and spanning 6 story lines in different time-periods rendering it a challenge for the 3 directors. It's, at times, a mangled mess and another, an ingeniously crafted masterpiece.'Some movies are like wine, it gets better with age and Cloud Atlas deserves some time to be digested and etched in people's minds.'",8,2,4,14 December 2012
John Wick: Chapter 2," Wild Wild Wick
","If there ever was a great videogame movie, it'd be John Wick. Its everything a gamer would love in a movie: a paper-thin plot where you don't have to exert your brain, a motive to kick ass and then kick ass like there's no tomorrow; all leading to a satisfying conclusion. John Wick did just that and excelled at it. Its not everyday you get to see a man hell bent on seeking revenge coz someone killed his dog. In a day and age where audiences are slapped and saturated with a superhero movie almost every second month, the directors had also crafted an enjoyable action flick.Sequels are always at the receiving end of biting criticism and with good reason too. Sequels, be it to a good movie, a game or a book, they try hard to up the ante, top its predecessor by doing the same crap again & again (Quote Einstein here) and fails miserably at it. There are only a handful of movie sequels which actually bested its first outing. Chapter Two of John Wick's saga picks up exactly where the first left off and there on its another fight to the finish. Emphasis on FIGHT to the FINISH. The movie wastes no time to put you into the thick of action and boy, does it feel good to see John playing an orchestra with those guns.Where Chapter Two wins is it knows exactly what to do to please its audience. People who loved the original will definitely feel right at home, people who wants more are obviously served more plot, more action and more characters and people who wants a great ending are also satisfied to a certain extent. Chapter Two recycles the best elements of John Wick and adds a bit more depth and a lot more action and never forgets where it belongs. While John Wick's premise was laughably good, Chapter 2 let's you go indepth into the organization Wick works for. It ain't anything groundbreaking but the organizations's rules and mechanisms are put into good use and serves for a good plot device.Keanu Reeves had been the butt of memes and jokes for a while now. While he wasn't always known for his acting prowess, he was always known for his style. I was a fan and I am still a fan. There are pitfalls in any actor's career and he's gone through hell of a lot. John Wick was a well deserved break for the guy. He'd put in a lot of effort in the role and it showed. And its no different here, Chapter 2. The supporting cast were pretty good too starting from Ian McShane as Winston, the seemingly innocent owner of the Continental hotel and Lance Reddick as the all-welcoming receptionist of the same. Ruby Rose as Ares, a mute femme fatale and the same goes for Common as Cassian both out for planting a bullet in Wick's head. Reeves' old 'mentor' returns in Chapter Two, yep, Lawrence Fishburne returns as an eccentric, semi-preaching crime lord but does the job well for his meagre screen time. My only disappointment was Santino D'Antonio as the lead antagonist, he did give Wick a hard time but the guy just didn't cut it for me neither was he an intimidating villain.Dan Laustsen is a name I haven't heard much prior to Chapter Two, but he does a decent job in bringing out Rome as well as New York to life. The total standout is the score from Tyler Bates and it just blew me away. I never paid attention to the score in John Wick, but in this one, the themes are much more apt syncing perfectly with the scenes and it definitely stands out.Try listening 'John Wick Reckoning' and tell me you didnt love it. Chances are that if you loved the movie, you're gonna love the score too.If I had to discuss flaws it would be the complete disregard of the open violence that was happening on screen. I do believe the justification would be so that these are trained assassins and they can be super silent killers. Chapter Two also lacks a bit of emotion which was what visibly motivating John Wick in the first movie.While it disheartens me to see a man running and gunning around for his life, unable to mourn for his dead wife and to get some peace, John Wick and Chapter Two has set a perfect example how to create a good old school action movie. Chapter Two's action was fluid and less of that motion-blur nonsense. Its well choreographed and packs a punch, the gun play felt orgasmic and there were some melee sequences that made me cringe. Calling it 'Hyper-violent' would be an understatement coz while John Wick actually laid ground to a violent action movie, Chapter 2 takes it to whole new level and believe me it just feels badass. Its definitely not GREAT, but John Wick franchise proves that you don't need superheroes to have an enjoyable action flick.",8,4,7,29 June 2018
Incredibles 2," The Name Still Say it All
","14 Years. Highly Anticipated Sequel...yada yada.... You know the drill.
For me, Incredibles was by far the best movie Pixar ever made. I am sorry Toy Story & Ratatouille, Incredibles definitely takes the throne here. Every movie Pixar made after Incredibles I kept asking 'Wait....where's Incredibles 2? Who asked for Cars 2? Didn't we get enough closure with Toy Story 2? And lastly who in the right mind wanted Cars 3?' Almost a decade and a half later we finally get a sequel and does it live up to a decade worth anticipation?Incredibles 2 starts off right where the first left off. Following a short encounter with the Underminer, Bob Parr (Mr. Incredible) and his family get scrutinized again for all the destruction and chaos. Jobless, forced to relocate to a motel and having not a clue how to keep the family together, Bob & Helen (Elastigirl) along with Lucius (Frozone) gets a proposal from Winston Deaver and his sister Evelyn from Devtech, a corporate giant who wants to bring back the Supers via documenting their adventures through a video camera fixed within their suits.The tables have turned this time and the lucky number goes to Elastigirl to take up 'super assignments'. Elastigirl takes the limelight here while Mr. Incredible takes a backseat: a dad looking after the family and having a tough time in her absence (and not admitting the same). Things obviously go awry for both Helen and Bob. While Helen is threatened by Screenslaver, a masked antagonist who hypnotizes people using screens and making them do awful things, Bob almost has a breakdown trying to juggle a pissed-off, adolescent Violet, a hyperactive Dash whose homework keeps his dad up all night and add to it a delightfully scene-stealing baby Jack-Jack.At its core, Incredibles had always been about family, how they keep things together while secretly wishing to go back to their exciting, super, espionage lives and that's what that made the original so unique. The same has been carried down to Incredibles 2. The little nuances you're faced with when you're running a family is just beautifully depicted and as a husband and a father, I could relate to a lot of things. Baby Jack-Jack, whom we had seen glimpses of in the first one is terrific in this one. I would say the scenes with him are the best. Like how Mr. Incredible stumbles upon his powers. A bundle of joy indeed.The weakest link in the plot is the villain Screenslaver and unfortunately, you can see the twist from a mile away. I wouldnt say it spoils the movie but Incredibles set a standard so high for villains that this antagonist looks ill-conceived. What I also found lacking were the 'goosebumps moments' that were sprinkled lavishly in the first Incredibles. Maybe its because the novelty has faltered in the second outing but yet again, it wouldn't have hurt to include a scene or two reminiscent of the 'Dash running on water' sequence from the first which was an absolute blast to watch.Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl are flawlessly embodied once again by Craig T Nelson and Holly Hunter makes them feel like real life people than animated characters. The same goes for the supporting characters, Samuel L Jackson as Frozone, Bob Odenkirk as Winston, Sarah Vowell and Huck Millner as Violet and Dash respectively. Edna Mode voiced by Brad Bird himself is still a rockstar! Michael Giacchino's score still packs the same punch and is absolutely spellbinding. Who would have thought blending a kind of 60's campy music with James Bond-esque themes would create such wonders.In the end, Incredibles 2 despite all its mesmerizing visual glory, the brilliant family dynamics, and the action setpieces, live a little short of its expectation. Don't take me wrong its still a good sequel and I understand 14 years worth of anticipation should be hard to live up to but seems like Brad Bird was playing it safe. If Incredibles was You Only Live Twice, Incredibles 2 plays more like Tomorrow Never Dies (an exaggeration). Five years from now, Incredibles will be the movie I'd love to watch with my kid; Incredibles 2 though, I will still have to watch for its a great extension to the original.",7,1,2,29 June 2018
Her," Beautiful! Nuff Said!
","'Boy, Do I want OS one. Or maybe not!'Directed by Spike Jonze, Her is the new movie starring Joaquin Phoenix. If you are familiar with Jonze's movies you'll know this ain't your usual romance drama neither is it purely sci-fi. Spike's humor and weirdness is smeared all over Her (no puns intended). Remember Being John Malkovich? Her ain't that odd but can come awfully close. At the same time Her could be considered a good drama and more than that, a great love storyten times better than Twilight (insert Still better than Twilight meme here).You are introduced to a introverted, lonely, be- moustached Theodore played by Joaquin Phoenix. Haunted and heartbroken over his impending divorce, Theodore lives on rather drably with his job as a letter writer. He's one day introduced to the new OS One who adopts a female personality by name Samantha and voiced by Scarlet Johansson. Theodore with in no time starts investing emotions with Samantha, and her, equally bonding with him. Like any relationship they talk, do stuff together, romance and even have sex but in the end things get messed up. Her is first and foremost a love story and beautifully acted out by Joaquin Phoenix. One would say it lies on his shoulders solely. Joaquin is known to be very selective about his movies and this is rather a strong one. Scarlett Johansson was no less impressive. There's no denying the fact that she's hot and can most definitely act, but to carry over that sexiness and acting prowess only through her voice is a feat in itself and she does it perfect. You listen to her and you get to visualize her, such is the effort she's put in the performance. I failed to recognize Amy Adams initially, she was totally different from the bombshell she played in American Hustle and evidently she's an actress who can make wonders both in commercial and art house movies. Rooney Mara & Olivia Wilde makes the most of whatever's allotted of their screen time. Hoyte Van Hoytema's captivating cinematography and Owen Pallett's soulful score only adds to the brilliant narrative and direction Spike has bestowed upon Her. There's one word that could perfectly explicate Her and it's 'beautiful'. In the near future it wouldn't be completely impossible to rule out OS like these. And it wouldn't be surprising if people shares their feelings with it as well. Its zany, Yes but you can't possibly ignore the fact there are people who'd do that. At some point of time, people are bound to try and find a shoulder to lean on, electronic or NOT. Given Spike Jonze's track record it wouldn't be surprising if its all too weird (and sometimes creepy if you think about it) but HER is one movie you absolutely do not want to miss.",8,0,0,19 April 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," Cars, Carnage & Crazies
","Mad Max Fury Road is everything you've never expected from a modern day action movie. And if you've set your expectations low or aren't into post-apocalyptic movies, you'll be in for a surprise. And by the end of it, you'd have wished that you'd never thought so low about George Miller's ambitious masterpiece.30 years since the fourth movie, George Miller sets Mad Max Fury Road in a world where almost everybody has gone insane, including its lead, Max Rockatansky. The plot is paper thin and its nothing but an escort mission, lead by Max Rockatansky and Imperator Furiosa, through barren post-apocalyptic wastelands and chased by the main antagonist, Immortan Joe and his maniac War Boys. This is a standalone movie and can hold strong on its own, but if you do want to get into the tone and mood of Mad Max, you oughta watch the old trilogy as it also sheds some light on Max's story and arguably on who Immortan Joe really would be.Its one orgasmic chase sequence, from start to end, and there is little room for character development. But who's complaining when you are glued to your seats, entertained shitless with its almost unrelenting brutal action. Nothing can prepare you for the intense action in Mad Max Fury Road and this review might feel meaningless until and unless you've experienced it. Its all out gritty and it'd help if you've got a wicked sense of humour. You are also not given much time to think as you are pushed from to one action set piece to the next.As Max, Tom Hardy does have an ample role to play in the narrative, but this is essentially a Furiosa movie set in the Mad Max universe. Charlize Theron's Furiosa is indeed the lead protagonist and Max just accompanies here in her insanely dangerous 'road trip' and you cant help but applause at Theron's strong performance here. I am not a huge Nicholas Hoult fan, but in Mad Max he delivers as Nux. As for Immortan Joe, Hugh Keays-Byrne delivers and it is a real feat when he has a mask on which covers most of his face. It would have been great if they had shown his face at least once, at least for old time's sake to see how 'Toecutter' from the original looked like now.The visuals, doubtlessly, are spectacular and what adds to the sheer beauty of it are practical effects. We've all been conditioned to watching and, growing on, CGI heavy movies this past decade and the difference here could be instantaneously felt. Its not completely devoid of CGI wizardry but practical effects dominates the visuals here and its nothing less than eye popping. For the first time, normal 3D felt serviceable and at the same time I kept repenting that I didn't see it in IMAX. You know its good when you see your partner dodging car parts and entrails every now and then. Normal 3D does wash out, what would have otherwise been, a brilliant color palette and the end result is a somewhat dark and de-saturated film. Exceptional sound design and Junkie XL's background score is the cherry on top.Compared to the old trilogy, The Road Warrior still stands supreme. Suffice to say, Mad Max Fury Road had me, breathless, gaping at the extremely well choreographed action sequences. I had to wait a few hours before I could collect my thoughts on the movie and rant about it. This is by far the best action movie I have seen this year, OH YES, much better than Avengers Age Of Ultron. As for the feminism critique revolving this movie.WHO CARES! This here is a fine piece of action cinema, Thank you, George Miller!",9,4,10,15 May 2015
The Martian," Ridley Scott's Awesome Comeback!
","Minutes into The Martian, Matt Damon's Mark Watney says 'I'm gonna have to science the s**t out of this' and I swear I chuckled so loud that the guy next to me was eyeballing me. I never thought I'd be in for a treat going for Ridley Scott's The Martian. Of course I am a huge Scott fan but his last two movies were a bit too tiresome to sit through. The aging director's prowess felt bumbling a bit, but The Martian proves that he's still got it. This is Sir Ridley Scott's awesome Comeback!Lets get the obvious stuff out of the way. NO, I am not going to compare Interstellar or Gravity or even Apollo 13 with this one. 'Apples, Oranges and a PERIOD' is what I'd add if anybody'd even start to argue about the same. The Martian sits cozily in a niche that Scott has carved so well.The Martian is a straightforward sci-fi drama about an astronaut stranded on Mars. It is about his sheer will that he 'wont die on Mars' and up to his wits to survive in hopes of a rescue team to arrive. Its equal parts drama, sci-fi and survival genre and it never tries to be anything more than that. There is nothing that's too complex to comprehend, nothing that beckons for multiple viewings and despite its flaws it comes out a winner. The flaws were too obvious and felt deliberate as if Scott wanted us to ignore it and go with the flow. I had already sunk into the fact that there were so much flaws and to think about the same while watching the movie would ruin it for me. And it did wonders for me! What you get is a well acted, well written, visually arresting and unambiguous sci-fi movie with chuck-loads of comedy and tension to drive you till the finale.The Martian is a Matt Damon show! He was never a bad actor but his post-Bourne roles never needed much of an effort. Scott opened an awesome sandbox for Damon where he makes the most of it. The 'log files' worked out for a great mechanic that was used to document most of Watney's life on Mars and it felt like Damon was interacting more with us than a video capture device. A stellar supporting cast also supplements The Martian's narrative. The AAA cast included Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Michael Peña, Sean Bean, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Mackenzie Davis, Donald Glover and instead of overcrowding the movie, each one of their performances were memorable. Even Donald Glover's barely 5 minute of screen time remains etched in my mind. Agreed it was much more fun watching Damon 'Science-ing the S**t out' but at the same time the supporting felt integral and never came off as a 'me too' addition.The Martian could have easily been a tense drama or rather have an over-all grim tone but it successfully injects well paced comedy and balances out the tension and drama. Thanks to Drew Goddard the comedy in The Martian doesn't feel forced. Get me started on the licensed tracks in the movie and I might not even stop; brilliant selection of licensed tracks that gave the movie a quirky beat.Sci-fi need not be mindbogglingly complex or have logical explanation for every damn detail on screen or even demand multiple viewings. Most of yesteryear's sci-fi classics focused more on 'fiction' than 'science' and it worked out well. I loved The Martian more than Interstellar or Gravity. I am no scientist and I am not here to argue about the plausibility of everything that happened in The Martian. I was there for entertainment and boy, did I get it served hot! Absolutely terrific performances by Matt Damon and the supporting cast, superbly written by Goddard and all executed perfectly well by Sir Ridley Scott. Come to think of it, even the the recent discovery of liquid water on Mars feels like a huge Marketing stint for The Martian.",8,6,26,6 October 2015
