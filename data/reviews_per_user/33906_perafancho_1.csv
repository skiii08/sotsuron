Requiem for a Dream," Superb, a true modern masterpiece
","When I decided to start my DVD collection, I decided it had to be composed by only the best available titles.  I did not want to fill my cases with summer blockbusters which lacked storylines, but wasted special effects. I wanted true filmmaking, preferably independent.  We all know that Hollywood has their stars and their money, but most of their movies lack everything a real movie should have.  Someone recommended Requiem for a Dream, so I read reviews about it here on IMDB.  I proceeded to purchase it and view it with some of my friends.  We were absolutely impressed.The story is so strong it leaves deep marks in those who view it.  Hubert Selby Jr. wrote a great novel, and he and Aronofsky did a terrific job in turning it into a screenplay.  The decadence of human beings of different ages, races and sex is true in everyday life, and the movie does not hide it.  It is strong and is shown as it should be.The performances are brilliant.  Ellen Burstyn gives her best with the role of Sara Goldfarb.  Jennifer Connelly, besides her beauty, portrays a perfect Marion, who takes advantage of that beauty in pursuit of a dream.  Jared Leto and Mr. Wayans do not fall behind, not to mention Christopher MacDonald as Tappy Tibbons.  Their interaction onscreen is absolutely marvelous and they never let the story fall apart, unlike the lives of the characters they play.The music is great.  Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet provide a solid musical background in every scene.  The soundtrack is so good everybody I know comments about it and some, including myself, have it constantly playing in our computers.  It is strong, it is suspenseful, it is brilliant.The directing by Aronofsky is excellent.  I saw Pi after seeing Requiem and I was impressed by how much this director can put into a movie with so little experience, but not little talent.  It is directors like these what films need, not greedy producers who want to make money out of the dumbest ideas.  Filmmaking should be an art, not a business.  Picasso didn't paint or sculpt to live in riches.  Neither did Beethoven or Mozart when they composed their symphonies.  As a matter of fact, most of them lived rather normal lives, contrasting with the opulency of those who now buy their belongings or works at auctions.  Thank you, Mr Aronofsky, for being a true artist.",9,1,1,26 July 2002
