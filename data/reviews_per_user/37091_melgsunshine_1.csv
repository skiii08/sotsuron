The Benchwarmers," Can't imagine it not tickling your funny bone!
","I really enjoyed this movie! It has a great storyline and is full of off the wall moments and characters. I can't imagine it not tickling your funny bone! Some people have said that Jon Heder's character (Clark) is too much like Napoleon Dynamite, but I disagree. To write these characters off as too similar because they are both 'nerds' is stereotypical and unfortunate. In contrast to Napoleon, Clark is a very happy-go-lucky and gentle spirit who smiles a lot and is very naive and a little slow. Napoleon wasn't any of those things, he didn't see humor in much of anything, never smiled, and came across as angry. There is a vast contrast between these characters, though they are both 'outcasts', they are nothing alike in personality!! And I think Heder did a wonderful job playing a totally different kind of 'dork' in this movie.I also really enjoyed Rob Schnieder's performance as a more serious side of a character he played got the spotlight. This movie really showcased his skills as an actor for me.David Spade and all of the other actors were wonderful as well. See it!",10,1,3,9 August 2006
