Walk the Line," if you like Johnny Cash his music you definitely need to check out the performances of Joaquin and Reese !
","First of all, liking something or not is very subjective, whatever is written here, you should go watch the movie yourself and make up your own mind. In my view the performance of Joaquin and Reese as Johnny and June is fabulous and talent full! BUT i can't say that this is the best film from 2005...no, not in my opinion. The amount of dead performers in this movie is exaggerated...Elvis, Orbison, j-l Lewis + entourage... In a certain scene somebody encourages J.Cash to take pills and says, Elvis takes 'em too. I don't know why that sneer was necessary for.. So, enjoy Joaquin and Reese for their musical performance and the magnificent love story between them... The rest is a little 'zombie returns'-show because of too much dead artists !",7,0,0,12 February 2006
