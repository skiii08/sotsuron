Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," entertainment at its finest
","this movie exceeded my expectations by far, i went into this movie knowing nothing about what i was about to see. all i heard was that it was a mocumentry.boy was i surprised viewing the first scene where borat introduces all the people from his home town, i was honestly beginning to think movies could not make me laugh anymore but this movie kept me laughing throughout the entire film. it is just so crazy and it totally breaks through the borders. there are jokes you would never expect to hear and with borat it is totally exceptable. he is a very likable character.the movie is totally wacky and unpredictable, you see scenes that are totally unexpected, and wildly funny and entertaining, i was excited throughout the entire film to see what would happen next, what encounter borat would go through next. there is nothing like shock value, seeing the faces of unsuspecting people in outrageously funny situations, and these people almost never find the situation funny which is what makes it all the more enjoyable.i could only, wish they would make more films like borat, films that are not confined by borders, borders of racism, homophobia etc. Borat pokes fun at many things people take very seriously and that is what makes this a special film",9,1,6,25 November 2006
Oldboy," different and refreshing
","wow i sure was surprised to look at all the negative reviews building up on this site, there is nothing wrong with this movie it is great, it is totally different and original. Asian people have such a different way of life then us and it really shows in their movies. watching foreign films is such a nice break from the usually westernized films we see all the time.there is quite a complicated story here, but not only is it complicated it is very strange, very unpredictable and just weird. i love it. Oh Dae-Su is mysteriously and suddenly imprisoned for 15 years without an explanation. he is then released. throughout the entire film he is just a play toy of some deranged man who gets pleasure from watching Oh Dae-Su do ridiculous horrible things, things Oh Dae-Su himself does not realize he is doing.stories don't get much more bizarre then this one but it is a very entertaining movie and i totally enjoyed every second of it. this movie stepped outside the boundaries and that is why it has become so popular, this movie is not afraid to include pedophiles, and men who commit incest. and because of that it makes for a much more interesting story.the camera work and scenery is very masterful and beautiful, it is a very visually pleasing movie, and it leaves you feeling good, or me anyways, i mean sure some people may be offended by this film, but perhaps that's just because they are too stuck and have stopped mentally growing,they cannot handle films that are outside their bubbles of reality or they it is just not up their alley.either way i highly recommend watching this film, if you don't like then its just not for you, i would say if you like stories like kill bill etc then you should defiantly check this one out.",8,13,57,7 December 2006
The Evil Dead," not bad
","this is a fairly good zombie movie, it is different then most it deals a lot with satanic elements in it. i noticed it had parts similar to the exorcist.it is a very entertaining movie but nothing to special. if you are a fan of brainless zombie movies that are for cheap entertainment and shock value only then you will like this.this is nothing more then a cheap thriller and it is quite dated. the story consists of a group of teenagers going to a cabin and then uncovering a necronomicon and a tape recorder, anyways after a series of events they end up releasing a evil spirit that posses them one by one leaving ash alone to kill all his friends and try and survive.all in all this movie did not leave a lasting impression on me it was just a cheap night of simple entertainment that i will soon forget.",6,0,2,11 December 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," beautiful
","wow, what a great movie, this one caught me off guard i did not even know as much as the storyline when i popped this into my DVD player. what a great movie it has anything you could ask for in a movie and more it really plays your emotions, it is filled with love, sadness, inspiration, despair, humor, loneliness, deceit and the list could go on and on.this is a story about a couple who really has an amazing relationship, but they let a few issues bring them down and on the spur of the moment they end it. it is so true that you really do not know what you have until you loose it, and this movie really exemplifies that.there are so many things to be learned from this film, all i can say is watch it, i assure you there is something in this gem for you. however this is very much a thinking and feeling movie it is not just some cheap Hollywood production with sex and violence, in fact there is neither of those in this movie.it is a movie that tells you to hold onto what you love and never let it go, because you never know what might happen, it tells you to really live every day as if it is your last for your life blinks before you.this will be one of the few movies i full heartedly recommend to anybody, and i am very glad to see that it already has quite the popularity. if you have not seen this movie then see it, get it into your head as soon as possible, for your life is ticking away and you don't want to learn you are living a crappy one before its too late.",10,1,3,2 December 2006
Casino Royale," best one yet
","well i just saw this the other night, and i must say i enjoyed it and i had high expectations from the reviews i was hearing. this was by the far the best james bond movie yet and better yet they are starting from bonds first mission.the actors in this were superb it had an excellent cast, but one person stood out particularly well. daniel craig our new bond, he is perfect, he is what bond is meant to be. he is seemingly young and flamboyant, and most important of all he is actually a likable character, not some British snob like pierce brosnam.this movie does not only focus on action like its predecessors, it is full of wits, love and many twists. i have never really liked 007 movies but this movie has won me over. i mean there are a few fake scenes where bond is able to outrun bullets but overall the action is great, the script is great, the actors are great everything is top notch.if you like action movies, bond movies, thinking movies, poker then go and see this",8,1,2,25 November 2006
