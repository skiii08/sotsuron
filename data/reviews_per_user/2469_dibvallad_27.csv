Your Name.," fantastic
","This movie is by far my favorite of many animation movies, it's magical and fantastic, not only that it's completely beautiful and so visual, it's worthy of any award, you should watch it, pal.",9,0,0,7 May 2020
50 First Dates," Gold!!
","When they released the Mexican version (which I did not see haha) everyone was talking about the insult they made to the original so I was curious to see it and in summary this is my favorite romantic comedy, it is crazy so it conquers without a doubt",9,1,1,29 June 2020
Ghost," Sadly awesome
","A classic to watch before dying, I found it very nice but not so iconic at the end of the day although the most iconic probably does not come out of the mud scene, I still liked it and it kept me entertained in a good way alongside heartbreaking and ageless quotes",7,1,1,29 June 2020
Hereditary," Ari Aster, I'm your fan...seriously.
","It took me too long to be interested in seeing it, I liked that the terror was based more on ideas / concepts instead of screamers, the complexity of family relationships and the great performance of Toni Collete but all this requires patience, it kept me stuck despite everything.",9,1,2,28 June 2020
Captain Marvel," Significative for MCU but...
","I waited too long for this movie but in the end it was not much of what I expected, I love the character but not as the film or the movie itself.",6,0,0,28 June 2020
12 Angry Men," Greatest assignment ever
","I had to watch this movie because of a college assignment and I totally loved the movie, there's tension and it gives the audience to classify their own choices throughout the justifications of the twelve characters, if you begin the movie with a strong opinion of the situation, it could totally change by the end of it, it is really ingenious in a way that you feel totally amazed.",9,0,0,9 May 2020
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," More than a music themed movie
","I expected a cheesy and cringey movie but I ended up truly loving it, by the surface you'd think Will Ferrel was going to exaggerate situations with his character but actually that didn't happen, I even identified with Lars, he's totally human while Rachel McAdams does an incredible job as always, also you WILL NOT GET OVER THE SOUNDTRACK, trust me, it's awesome, I cried at the final act because of Rachel's passion and 'My Marianne''s incredible voice.",8,2,3,28 June 2020
"I, Tonya"," One event & two points of view
","I'm amazed how we got to see an opinion (or not even that...the opportunity) to see and discuss Tonya's side, it must be so sad not having that and this movie let us do that, an scandal of this huge size must be judged fairly and not even that but also, tell a story in a way you feel kind of represented.Definitely 'I, Tonya is' a 'must watch'",9,1,1,28 June 2020
Lost in Translation," Lost in their own lives
","This movie will get you thinking about what you're doing and if your desires are actually good or bad, I got a calm and relaxing vibe from this one and it's simply beautiful, Coppola did a great job showing us this story that many of us can't just get over it. Give it a try.",9,0,0,28 June 2020
Doctor Strange," One of those that are truly awesome!
","I can see it thousands of times and it is always a total enjoyment, it knows how to handle the rarity of comics with the MCU formula resulting in a completely interesting origin, of my favorite Marvel movies without a doubt, such a fan of this film",8,0,0,28 June 2020
Ant-Man," So underrated!!!
","I never doubt seeing it with my family every time I can, it turns out to be a refreshing original story, designed to entertain, it disadvantages things like the villain, using Luis a lot to make people laugh, etc. but still it's great, it defines very well the 'less is plus'",8,0,0,28 June 2020
LÃ©on: The Professional," Totally worth it.
",It's a must watch that it's pretty easy to see given that it's interesting and different from many others.,8,1,1,9 May 2020
Little Miss Sunshine," A shiny movie
","I did enjoyed it given that it's funny, relatable and iconic but it had the potential to go further with the audience's feelings but actually that wasn't something I could see like I'd love to, also I don't think it deserved the best picture nomination, anyways I do think it was the BEST comedy of the year, the cast is awesome and talented, finally, it's a black comedy that really cheers you up even though sometimes it could show a pessimistic scenario, that's where the magic happens.",8,0,0,28 June 2020
The Shining," Great horror film
","This is by far one of my favorite movies and even though it's way different to the Stephen King's book, it stays strong and keeps walking without context from the book, it may have mistakes and facts that doesn't fit with me but I guess it deserves to be watched.",8,0,1,9 May 2020
American Beauty," if a movie changes your life or the way you see it, it is said that it did a great job.
","...Although it took several years for me to watch this one, I only knew that when it finished, something had changed.In American Beauty we follow Lester, a forty-year-old with an unhappy life disguised as being perfect with his wife Carolyn and daughter Jane, just the protagonist that the cinema tries to avoid in his productions being the lie of the American dream, looking as if he had In a coma all his life, he decides to erase the monotony of his existence when he meets Angela, Jane's friend, no matter who he takes between the forces of his chaos, he embarks on a journey on the way to his death.What I am most passionate about seeing this film is the need to destroy the concept of American perfection and what surrounds it, drops of work, marriage, home and ideal work in a rain of real misery, to achieve this we see everything through Lester's eyes, the most indifferent of the tape about what his life is concerned, he says it himself ... 'I have lost something, I am not sure what it is but I know that I did not always feel so sedated', this man He begins to change everything to recover what he lost trying to have fewer responsibilities, less work, focusing on himself to break the chains that enslave him, in the first half hour of the film we see how there are people who do not try to show that they are happy like Jane but on the other hand there are people who lock themselves in a bubble of perfection to represent a good image and reflect success, just what Carolyn does. We can see the real despair of people like Carolyn in the 'I'll sell this house today' scene and the final collapse of not achieving it, showing that happiness is a mask that each one forges; the film manages to criticize this system of perfection but not with the desire to make it appear as incorrect or unfair, but it does it so that the audience sees the reaction of these characters to it, it gives us stereotyped characters but capable for the public to identify themselves with them even the most selfish, a man tired of his work (and his life itself), a woman who seems to have everything under control but in reality has no stability, a teenager indifferent to what surrounds her and who does not she likes herself. The characters in the film are profound, objective, out of place, but each one has their own story and are presented in the same way, in addition to the fact that their very existence makes them influence the story in a great way, even if they are not the protagonists, something almost impossible to see in the movies where they go in a story line and forget what is around, here we have characters like Ricky Fitts, a cold boy who knows how to appreciate real beauty, his father, a strict colonel who represses his interior, Angela, a rogue girl who avoids being ordinary and the cause of Lester's awakening, just waking up surprises the audience since we are talking about a love 20 years apart but to me it seems that the relationship of Lester and Angela goes beyond a romance forbidden by age but the insecurity of a teenager and the crisis of a 42-year-old man who seeks to regain youth and his surroundings.I love to see how the film is not only supported by an ingenious story with deep characters and masterful performances such as the Spacey that won him the Oscar, but the photography manages to give careful and precise shots that give it a unique touch, characteristic symbols such as roses and the fullness of red throughout the film, which could well reflect the perfection of materialism and the lust of the characters.The film is not perfect and it is what it wants, as an audience we are immersed in the voice-over of the catharsis of a man who, when he dies, embarks us to the beauty of life and his shipwreck, a portrait of society, to worry about what that people think and finally understand beauty, not the American one, but everything, including a plastic bag dancing in the air.",9,1,1,2 July 2020
Silver Linings Playbook," Excelsior!
","Funny, romantic (not cheesy) and accurate, a total change of the romance genre adding a philosophical and actually real side of mental illness, Bradley and Jennifer's chemistry is stunning and refreshing while Pat's parents are pure gold for the film.
It's nice to know there are movies like this.",9,1,1,29 June 2020
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," It's okay
","I certainly expected way more than this, I was so excited for its release, I even brought the book that it's kind of script for the movie and I got truly sad because it's not really good, visually it is and it's interesting to explore the Wizarding World way more than the Harry Potter saga does but I just didn't love Fantastic Beasts, they keep telling us Grindelwald its terrible, worse than Volvdemort, Voldy was just someone who was just like him since many years but I didn't really appreciate that...",6,0,0,28 June 2020
Jackie," It's actually really interesting
","I can't believe what I missed, even when Natalie is silent you see more than a million emotions, she shows you a quite complex closeup between the press view and the Kennedy family, I loved it too much.",8,1,1,29 June 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Wow...
","I never expected a movie that doesn't follow up the end of the story which is based on and it is not something bad, it's actually something I enjoyed and appreciate, also, I just can't get over the outstanding cinematography and retro style.",8,1,2,29 June 2020
Brave," Not really what the audience would expect...
","Don't get me wrong, It's beautiful and totally refreshing, It's nice to not get to watch another princesse's movie with the typical plot of finding her lover (actually I'd say this was one of the first ones) and focussing on how this girls wants to be free without marrying some strange...I totally appreciate it, come on the plot is about Merida and her mother's relationships...although it was not enough to be represented as it should be, it is funny and beautiful but I didn't get really interested as the movies continues but the comedy surely helps",6,0,0,28 June 2020
Les MisÃ©rables," Loved it!
","It managed to be touching and musically awesome, that's what I could enhance more, I keep streaming the whole album and songs like 'Valjean's Soliloquy' and 'One Day More' still gives me goosebumps every time I listen to them, although watching the whole music with every single dialogue like a song has never been my favorite resource of the film, I don't really find the film like awesome as the music but I would say I enjoyed it and sometimes that's enough.",7,0,0,28 June 2020
It Chapter Two," Well, I enjoyed it.
","It is literally recycling the first one, yes I enjoyed it but I was very disappointed, the reason why it comes out is its predecessor and even in the content it shows although its cast is very perfect, still well I'm a fan sorry",5,0,0,28 June 2020
Mother!," Stressed & amazed.
","I do have to say I felt so stressful with this movie, it may be in a certain way hard to watch because we have to watch many situations that personally, I could have never dealt with in the way the character does...but it's one of those movies that by the end of it you're staring at the wall trying to process everything and realizing its true meaning, in my opinion that what makes a movie worthy, the fact you feel different after watch it and 'Mother!' totally gives you that.",8,0,2,9 May 2020
AmÃ©lie," It deserves the hype
","This one is really enjoyable, hilarious and visually beautiful, actually the most I remember from this movie was I being in love with the esthetic because it's so unique and seems to be a whole different world coming out from a fantasy book for children but with an interesting plot.",8,0,0,9 May 2020
Midway," More than I expected
","I thought it was an interesting plot but easily lost, the battle scenes kept me too nervous and at the peak of my seat, the cast is quite incredible although it seems like another generic war movie, I think it's worth it",8,2,2,28 June 2020
Happy Feet," Weird and bright
","I have seen this movie since I was a kid and even nowadays with my nieces, we always end up energetic given that the movie is touching, funny and innocent, I guess it deserves a watch for the new generations so they can appreciate the flaws and highness of the animation on any year possible.",7,0,0,28 June 2020
Back to the Future," Iconic saga
","I surely think the second and third movie are not as good as this first one, this is completely iconic and I loved it at first sight, it's easy to watch because it guides you through a decent story without making such a big deal, we're talking about time travel and it feels really authentic, funny and interesting, something that lacks on so many first movies of a whole saga.",8,1,1,9 May 2020
