National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Another adventure for the Gate's family
","I read some of the other reviews and I have to say WOW!! I find it hilarious anyone would say a movie wasn't realistic or it was far fetched. So I suppose Star Wars, Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, etc. Are completely plausible story lines right?! Here's a dose of reality: we go to the movies to escape reality and be entertained. Being a Mom I always look at things in the standpoint of is it acceptable and entertaining for my family to watch. This movie completely lives up to those requirements! It is fun/ funny and has an Indiana Jones for kids feel to it. Plus I absolutely enjoy the humor in it. I can watch this movie with my kids or by myself. If you're looking for a fun and uplifting flick this is a great pick.",9,0,0,11 October 2014
