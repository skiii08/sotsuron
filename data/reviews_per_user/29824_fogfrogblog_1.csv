Ghost," All time favorite
","Ghost has everything of a genre, drama, sexy scene, suspense, romance, a little action, thriller, comedy, sci-fi, and even a painful death in the end that is so simple it would make SAW like a joke. All the chemistry between actors work very well. It's a movie that plays with your emotions constantly, not a dull moment. Sixth Sense is boring compare to this movie. Very creative writing, very smart. Even the editing, the transitions were ahead of its time. And this is before digital special effects were popular.This is really a classic, that you can watch over and over. They did sound effects really well in this film.I would recommend this to everyone, specially those who are in the film-making business.",10,4,6,25 December 2007
