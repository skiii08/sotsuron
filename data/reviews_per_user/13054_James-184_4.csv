The Devil's Advocate," In conclusion, do miss it
","Take C.S. Lewis' Screwtape Letters, put 'em in a monologue for Al Pacino, sprinkle in semi-wooden acting by Keanu Reeves, and pour sloppily into a container shaped like The Firm.There are pluses: I've seen Keanu act worse than this, Pacino's rants are always fun (he could speak Swahili and you'd get a mild charge), and the digital effects--though sparingly used--are masterful (probably because they were sparingly used).But in all a murky, trite, predictable story.  You get the feeling that this was halfway through production when The Firm came out, and they had to go back to the drawing board post haste.  That, or else it was some novice screenwriter's high concept that made it bigger than anyone could have expected.",Null,0,0,26 September 2000
Blade," Quite a Good Vampire Film
","In terms of effects, fight choreography, raw action, gore, and pacing, the film rewards--and then some.  Sure, there are drawbacks.  Stephen Dorff is not inherently intimidating, but would critics have preferred Arnold Schwarzenegger?  Yes, the plot is fantastical, but first--this is a vampire movie, what do you expect?  And second, it's based on a comic book; a little far-fetchedness is normal.
There are plot holes, of course.  The villain's apparent master plan is to turn everyone into vampires.  If he succeeds, what will the vampires eat, each other?  But one only notices such gaps during the second or third viewing, and if you're watching it two or three times, I guess that makes it a successful action-horror thriller.",Null,0,1,30 August 2000
The Thing," Number One
","It's been 18 years since I first saw John Carpenter's The Thing, and it continues to occupy the top slot in my list of the scariest movies of all time.  There's something primally terrifying about that-which-cannot-be-stopped, and the Antarctic setting conveys a realistic feel of isolation that outstrips the aloneness in all three Aliens films (none of us have ever been to distant space outposts, but we can relate to the icy solitude of a human environment).  Yes, H. R. Geiger's Aliens were mind-numbingly horrific, in their speed and agility and sheer foreignness to everything human; in that regard, they capture the title as best extraterrestrials in film.  But though The Thing's creatures are also of alien origin, they fall more neatly--and fulfill completely--the niche of movie monster.  This disturbing film is a classic.",Null,0,1,24 August 2000
Casualties of War," A Casualty Alright...
","I confess: I didn't watch this one too closely.  In my defense, it was tough.I couldn't get over Michael J. Fox's presence in this movie.  Where was Doc Brown and the flux capacitor?  Where were the rest of the Keaton clan?Sean Penn could have saved me, but Penn has been in every Vietnam film ever made, or at least so it seems, and usually playing the same character, so the unique reality of this movie began to blur into all the other Vietnam pics in the genre.So you've got the surrealism of Fox as the lead and the mimeographed quality of Penn's calloused soldier redux.But I'm not too jaded to ignore the fact that the film packs some power. It doesn't hold a candle to Platoon or Saving Private Ryan, but if this is your first in the war-is-literally-and-viscerally-hell genre, be prepared to be stunned.That said, the flashback device may have never been so clunkily misused. Fox, after the war, sees a young Asian woman on a bus.  She resembles someone...fade to the jungles.  We never revisit that bus until moments before the credits roll-but in just enough time for a heavy-handed sage-wisdom summary just to make sure Fox can get on with his life.  Ah, if only the real veterans of that war could have been healed as easily.One scene in particular both rankles and amuses.  Fox, appalled by war atrocities, approaches his decent buddy and launches into what feels like a five-minute monologue on existentialist ethics: we are but brief candles, so we must bear our unbearable freedom honorably...live every day as if it were your last.  This scene was unwittingly spoofed in another Fox film, The Hard Way, when Fox's actor character steals overwrought lines from James Woods and delivers them with all the finesse of a Mack truck.DePalma, SchmePalma: Marty McFly should never have time-traveled to the Vietnam War.",Null,3,6,18 August 2000
