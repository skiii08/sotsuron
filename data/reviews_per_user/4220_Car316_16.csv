The Blair Witch Project," Scary as Heaven.
","The Blair Witch Project has a nice concept, but it just doesn't work.  I'm not saying this because I need gallons of blood and super-duper special affects to scare me either. For a horror movie to work, it needs to have some type of thought put into it. The concept is great, but the filmmakers do nothing with it. The characters are obnoxious and very stupid too. Would you still be holding a camera and filming, while being chased by some unknown force, and scared out of your wits? Overall, a great concept, but poorly executed. *1/2 (out of four)",Null,0,1,24 August 2001
Training Day," Solid police drama.
","Training Day is a good, solid police drama, but has an unsatisfying ending. It just didn't feel right. Washington is dynamic, in a oscar-winning performance. Hawke holds his own, too. Overall, despite a unsatisfying ending, this is an entertaining, high-powered police drama. *** (out of four)",Null,0,10,1 July 2002
Meet the Parents," Funny, but forgettable.
","This is a funny, but forgettable comedy. The laughs are there, but there's not much else to fall back on, and maybe not as quite as funny as it could've been. Overall, Meet the Parents is a pretty good, but forgettable comedy. **1/2 (out of four)",Null,0,0,9 August 2001
Scary Movie 2," Some big laughs, but spotty.
","Scary Movie 2 has some big laughs, but it's also spotty at times. For every good joke, there's a bad one up next, and it plays like that most of the way. The best bits are: The Exorcist parody, the talking bird, the cat fight (some thought it was stupid, but I thought it was quite amusing), Ray and the clown doll, giant Weeds coming to life, and a comment being made about some bloody footprints. Except for Ray, I felt the returning characters were more fun to watch this time around. Overall, Scary Movie 2 is spotty, but has some scenes that are very funny. **1/2 (out of four)",Null,0,1,22 December 2001
Forrest Gump," Simply a 'Either you buy it, or you don't' movie.
","Forrest Gump is simply a 'Either you Buy it, or you don't' movie. I bought it, because the movie is just so endlessly charming to me. Every scene is magical. And it just gets better and better as it goes along. The movie has everything, drama, comedy, adventure, war, etc. The soundtrack is great. Tom Hanks is magnificent also. Overall, Forrest Gump is endlessly charming and one of my  personal favorite movies. **** (out of four)",Null,1,2,8 July 2001
10 Things I Hate About You," Surprisingly entertaining '90s teen flick.
","On paper this movie sounds boring and predictable, but its surprisingly entertaining. The dialogue is fresh and the actors aren't one-note, with Julia Stiles being the standout. This is probably the best of the late-'90s teen movie craze, with American Pie coming in slightly second. Overall, a surprisingly entertaining '90s teen movie that delivers unexpected goods. *** (out of four)",1,1,10,18 February 2001
American Pie," Very funny, but not completely successful.
","American Pie is a very funny movie, but not completely successful. The characters are uninteresting, mainly do to all-too-typical dialogue, and lazy, all-too-familiar story development. Still, it has big laughs and is the second best out of the late-'90s teen comedies (second behind 10 Things I hate About You) **1/2 (out of four)",1,0,1,20 July 2001
American Psycho," Christian Bale is so good, but the movie gets dull too often.
","American Psycho is a movie that gets dull too often, but Christian Bale is exceptional. The movie could've really been set today, because it's not like materialism doesn't exist today. Fight Club, an enormously better satire, proved the '90s aren't no better than the '80s. Overall, Christian Bale's performance is what's saves this movie somewhat, from complete boredom. ** (out of four)",Null,0,0,27 July 2001
Edward Scissorhands," Entertaining Fantasy.
","Edward Scissorhands is an entertaining Fantasy from Tim Burton. Johnny Depp is Superb in the title role. Edward gets into some funny situations early on, then the film turns serious when the Suburbanites unfairly turn on him. The Score by Danny Elfman is absolutely beautiful. The ending may be a little overblown, but I don't think it's as bad as people say. Overall, an entertaining fantasy thats enjoyable from beginning to end. *** (out of four)",Null,0,0,30 May 2001
Rocky IV," A guilty pleasure in every sense of the word.
","I don't know why, but every time I watch Rocky IV, I get goosebumps. Sure, it's very predictable and completely unrealistic, but I can't help it. The Villain this time, Ivan Drago is menacing and scary. This also has the best fight, music and training montages of the entire series. Overall, Predictable and unrealistic as it is, it's still highly entertaining. *** (out of four)",Null,0,0,18 August 2001
Back to the Future Part III," Decent, but a little disappointing end to the trilogy.
","Back to the Future Part III is a decent end to the trilogy. Most of the movie takes place in the old west. The act by now, is getting a little old. Although, this sequel does possess the charm of the original, that Part II lacked somewhat, it still doesn't have the sheer energy, or explosive entertainment of Part II. This is not a bad movie, by any means. It's pretty fun (especially the train tracks finale), but it has a 'going through the motions' type feeling at times. Overall, a decent, but a little disappointing end to the trilogy. **1/2 (out of four)",Null,0,0,31 December 2002
Scream 2," I'll say it...better than the original.
","In my opinion this sequel to the entertaining original is even better. I felt it had a little more energy. I also felt that the characters of Gale, Dewey and Randy were better developed. The suspense was just as high. The Mystery behind the identity of the killer was also just as interesting. The movie is just a whole lot of fun. Overall a great sequel, even better than the original. ***1/2 (out of four)",10,0,0,23 January 2001
Bring It On," Doesn't quite click.
","I wasn't expecting a great movie when I sat down to watch this. The story and jokes just didn't click for me. The movie was never boring, because it has some nice eye-candy, and is extremely fast-paced, but the jokes and dialogue isn't nearly as smart as it thinks it is. Great eye-candy, but little else. ** (out of four)",Null,0,0,25 July 2001
Back to the Future Part II," Extremely entertaining sequel. (mild spoilers)
","Back to the Future Part II is a highly entertaining sequel, to the original masterpiece. This sequel takes off right where the first left off, with Doc, Marty and Jennifer Traveling to 2015. After 2015, they then travel back to 1985. It's there, they learn, that the timeline has been altered. So then they realize, they have to travel back to 1955, where most of the first movie took place, and fix the altered timeline. There are so many twists and turns and endless suspense, that this movie is like the Energizer Bunny. Overall, an extremely entertaining sequel, that only lacks the comedy and emotional impact of the original. ***1/2 (out of four)",Null,0,1,31 December 2002
The Replacements," Watchable at best.
","I can't believe all the good reviews for this movie on here. Sure, some formula driven movies can be fun, but this movie doesn't possess even an inch of originality! Almost every frame of this movie is a cliche. In all fairness, it is watchable and some of the jokes are amusing, but it's all been done countless times before, and better. ** (out of four)",Null,3,7,25 July 2001
Back to the Future," Grand entertainment.
","Back to the Future is grand entertainment from start to finish. It's full of relentlessly clever ideas, funny, charming characters, endlessly quotable dialogue and suspense. As fun as it is, it's the human aspect that makes the movie so special. All the performances are great, and Christopher Lloyd is unforgettable as Doc. The sequels are good, but they don't come close to this movie. This is one of my favorite movies of all time. **** (out of four)",10,1,2,21 July 2001
