It," An excellent introduction to the darker second chapter
","I do not understand the criticisms of this film?!
If you liked Stranger Things you will love the first chapter of this story.
The movie is great, acting is also good, the new clown is terrifying.
The old film was very bad and deserved a bad reputation, but this remake is excellent.
It is misinterpreted, this is not a classic horror with a lot of blood and brutal scenes.
The essence is at the psychological moment and internal struggles of the main characters.
Difficulties in growing up, poor family relationships and abuse are some of the problems children are struggling with.
The clown is a metaphor of inner fears, but also a fear of the unknown outside the comfort zone.
If we observe only the monsters, we will see that it is also complex, and in a mysterious way, plays the game with its victims.
Instead of the horror scene, we have awaiting.
Discomfort causes more fear than the expected bloody scene.
Tension and creepy moments are a sign of a good movie.
Fear and nervousness grow in us, and the expectation is greater.
The film is an excellent mix of mystery, horror, tension and humor, because the main characters are children.
I expect the second chapter with adult people to be darker, scary and bloody, similar to the classic horror.
So the first part is an excellent introduction to the second chapter.",9,0,0,6 January 2018
