Black Swan," This film died way before the white swan did!
","Why do one star reviews or at least reviews that give less than five and sometimes even four stars get buried? Even more so when it is a one-star review! that is what this review is so it will get buried! Natalie Portman is boring thanks to her character being boring as are the rest of the cast and as she is the best of a bad bunch (she must be, she won an Academy Award for the role after all which doesn't mean much as awards are only glorified adverts)! It's an artsy fartsy film that borrows (or should that be steels) from other films I have seen before. Many clich√©s are strewn throughout the film and the cinematography and directing doing nothing to improve the overall lack of enjoyment in what turns out to be a very confusing film as Nina succumbs more and more to her hallucinations. Nina being a meek, insipid, mild character would never have been given the starring role in a real ballet company and as for her searching for her bad side so that she could get and therefore play the bad swan well the way they went about it was, quite frankly, absolutely ridiculous! The hallucinations become really ridiculous to the point where you don't know if she is still hallucinating at the end or not! And why is she hallucinating anyway? She is not on some type of hallucinogenic drug so why is she hallucinating? If you are exploring your dark side and trying to find it you wouldn't hallucinate while doing! Just yet another stupid thing in the film! so Now some films such as Existenze can end with lots of unanswered questions, personally, I don't think this is one of those films! If you want to waste 108 minutes of your life watch grass grow or paint dry for that long as even that would be more enjoyable than this rubbish!",Null,3,5,3 March 2017
Sucker Punch," This is a VERY dark film!
","It's dark in lots of ways, well, alright not lots of ways, just two in fact. The first is the way it's filmed and the second ids the subject matter.Two girls whom I think are in their teens, one older than the other by I think 3-5 years see their Mother covered by a sheet obviously dead. They both breakdown crying. The man you see looks at her will and sees she has left everything to the two girls. This angers him and he takes it out on the older sister by abusing her, something you could tell he had done many times before. She escapes out of the house and he then abuses the younger sister. The older one comes back with a gun and takes a shot at him, misses him, hits a pipe and deflects into her sister killing her. The man then hands her to a mental hospital which is just a front for a brothel and we find out the man is her step-father, meaning she is now an orphan, and the only way she can get out of it is when she is forced to dance for the male version of a Madam she creates fantasy scenarios and these are just superb! All bar the first one involve all of the girls in the scenarios they all have a different personality than out of the scenarios. the C. G. I. is brilliant and as all of the scenes outside of the fantasy scenes were filmed in a dark, depressing, dreary way I thought the ones in them would be happy and colourful and bright but they weren't. they filmed in the same style as the scenes outside and it suited them perfectly! The C. G. I. was superb the action sequences were superbly choreographed and the directing is brilliant! THIS IS ANOTHER MUST SEE FILM! I'm off to see if I can add it to my D. V. D. collection!",9,2,3,5 June 2012
Wayne's World," If you miss this.... you really won't have missed anything.
",I am now in my early thirties and cannot for the life of me believe that when this film came out in 1992 I actually thought it was funny. Thank the Lord my taste in comedy has improved since then! the only good bit in the whole film was the Bohemian Rhapsody bit but that is only because of the fact that Bohemian Rhapsody is a Queen song and I love anything by Queen who are still one of the greatest Rock bands of all time even now years after Freddie Mercury's untimely demise. The jokes are lame and far and few between and the acting is only marginally better. There is a touching and thoughtful scene on a car bonnet but that is the only other best bit in the film. I have given it two stars because although the awful script was written by Mike Myers who has thankfully gone on to do MUCH better with the Austin Powers films the acting of the leads was almost makes the film watchable. If it were not for the fact that they somehow managed to get loads of famous people into the film including Aerosmith then it would get just one star from me. How this managed to spawn an even lamer sequel I will never know!,2,10,21,3 December 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," I Can Not Believe How Many People Have Rated This Drivel So Highly!
","I can not remember the last time I saw a Disney film that was as bad as this is. Why do people who have had no acting lessons and are not fully trained actors continually get acting work at the expense of those that have been fully trained and therefore can act? Johnny Depp is proof of point of someone who has absolutely no ability to act whatsoever due to having had no lessons in how to act and is the complete opposite of fully trained and yet he keeps getting work in front of someone who is fully trained! The rest of the cast did rather well with the dreadful script, the storyline was almost non-existent, and didn't do anything remotely new. If half of The scenes where buckles were swashed and cut the rest shorter there still would have been far more than enough swash buckling to suit everyone that went to see the film. At over two hours long half an hour could have been taken out and it still would have been far too long! Johnny Depp's English accent was....well....let's just say it was obvious that it was an American trying to speak in and with an English accent, unlike Kevin Costner when he did Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves! There was ABSOLUTELY NOTHING good about this generic pirate film. It had two story lines in it both of them having been told and shown countless times in far better ways numerous times before I wouldn't be at all surprised. OK so I Told a lie when I said there was absolutely nothing good about the film, as there was on thing good about it, the closing/end credits! Once they come on it means, thankfully, this extremely boring, exceedingly tedious film that has been stre-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-tched to as long as it can be can now be switched off!",1,1,4,5 November 2014
Ted," Don't wast your money on this rubbish!
","There is NOTHING, I repeat, NOTHING even remotely good, funny, entertaining or likable about this film! I found it to be boring, tedious, dreadful, and a chore to watch as I forced myself to see it to the end after having paid to watch it. I wasn't going to waste my money by deleting it from the hard drive on my P. V. R part way through the film! I'm going to do you readers a massive favour and tell you all what happens at the end so that you don't end up wasting your time and money watching this drivel! I cannot find any redeeming feature in this film! No, I tell a lie there is one and only one, and that is the clever way Ted has been made to look real.It's a tale about an eight years old boy who had no friends that was thrilled to get a stuffed cuddly bear as a Christmas present. Once received he then wished for it to come to life and so it did. Now as far as I can tell, in a prosperous country such as American and in a middle-class neighbourhood such as John Barratt was in the last thing an eight years old boy would be thrilled to receive is a stuffed teddy bear! Any way he got it, he made the wish, it came to life and became famous but didn't earn anything from being famous. that all happened pre credits. during the credits there is a montage of them growing up to adulthood and him in a job which even though he is always late for it and is hardly ever there he is still in line for a promotion. I wish I could find a job like that! Time and time again the bear ruins John's relationship with his girlfriend causing them to eventually split up. the two get drawn back together when they go chasing after Ted who has been kidnapped by a creepy man that is obsessed with him. The man wanted him for his son and after hearing Ted make a phone call to John takes Ted on a car trip. John and his now ex girlfriend Lori are in the car together on their final time together when the call is received work out where Ted is and head over to the house. As they get closer they see Ted in the man's car and give chase to a football stadium. The creepy man chases Ted up a stadium light stand and as he grabs hold of Ted's foot. On pulling Ted down ted is torn in two and his stuffing comes out. At this point I was so hoping the film would end but no there was still more rubbish to come. John and Lori grabbed all of the bits rushed home with him and stitched him back together. Guess who wished him back to life? Yes that's right Lori! The person whose life he had effectively ruined for the last four years by her boyfriend always putting the bear before her. the one that on coming back from their four year anniversary dinner to find a turd on the floor claimed it was there courtesy of one of the three very attractive ladies he was sitting on the sofa with! The film is too awful and how it managed to do so well at the box office is beyond my comprehension! There are lots of appalling films that do do well at the box office leaving me struggling to work out why. As far as this film goes and the Internet Movie Data Base reviewers and rater go there are only 2.7 percent of people that have taste and know what decent, funny comedy is!",1,5,10,7 December 2012
Horrible Bosses," Black? Yes! Funny? Not in the slightest!
","ANYONE RATING THIS RUBBISH ABOVE TWO STARS MUST EITHER BE RELATED TO ANYONE THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE FILM AND ARE CONTINUING TO PROMOTE IT, OR HAVE WATCHED A DIFFERENT FILM FROM ME OR ENJOY WATCHING FILMS VTHAT ARE TRULY AWFUL AND THEREFORE TRULY AWFUL FILMS APPEAL TO THEM AND THEY THINK TRULY AWFUL FILMS SHOUD GET A DECENT RATING! By the time the credits are done we find out what has happens to two of the three bosses. What about the third one?!?! What happened to him?!?! I didn't even smile once as this black film worked it's way from start to finish. Not only was this so-called comedy devoid of anything remotely funny it was also full of the usual boring, been done umpteen times before clich√©s! It was too long and after deciding to kill their bosses it concentrated on just one boss for the rest of the film. So much so that the second came across as an after thought, the fate of whom the viewers found out about as the credits rolled! I think the director has a problem with adding up as he forgot there were three bosses, the fate of all of whom should have been viewed by the audience before the end-credits had started!",1,7,14,16 October 2013
Doctor Strange," Yet Another Marvel Mess
","Even though Disney bought Marvel you should not attribute this rubbish to them! I can not remember when the last decent Marvel film was out in the cinemas but this should definitely be on the 'do not watch' list along with Avengers Age Of Ultron, and Guardians Of The Galaxy. There are at least one or two more but I can't think of the names of them right now! The characters are all exceedingly bland, I felt nothing for any of them. Not one is really all that memorable. The all-powerful The Ancient One wasn't powerful enough to stop pages from a spell book being stolen at the start of the film so not quite so all-powerful. Strange, after a car accident/crash joins a mystical retreat to learn how to use his hands again because he supposedly can't use them. Before going and finding the retreat he tries shaving but can't do that yet he can use his hands for everything else! The other characters are all secondary and lesser to Doctor strange and because the character, like the plot and the story(line) has so little to it, the film is padded out with stupidly long interdimensional fight scenes that make the film really confusing as there is no reason and no explanation for them. They just happen.",1,3,11,25 August 2017
Watchmen," Exceedingly over-hyped crap
","I seem to be typing that summary an awful lot recently about lots of different films recently. This is yet another one to add to that list! It is far too long, far too tedious, far too boring, far too dreary, far too dreadful, far too........ In fact there is NOTHING good to type about this load of absolute rubbish! The only reason to see the film is so that you too can then come onto I. m. d. b. and type your own honest review. An honest review being one such as this is letting people know just how bad the film is! The plot line is incredibly confusing. There are sub-plots that have absolutely no reason to be in the film at all. The characters are all exceedingly bland and extremely boring, so bland and boring that I have tried numerous times to watch the film and every time I have fallen asleep! The script is completely dreadful and the acting is almost as bad! The film is a very long, very drawn out. At two hours and forty-two minutes long at least one hour could be cut and the plot line still wouldn't make any sense but it would mean an hour less of your life wasted watching this turd! Better still, as I have been there and done it already take heed of what I and all of the other reviewers that have given it a 1 star rating have typed about this film.I'm not in the slightest bit surprised it made a loss big loss in takings at the box office after it's time on release was over! (why do reviews such as this one ALWAYS get buried (come after) behind loads of amazing ones that all have high-stars (6-10 stars) ratings just because it is a low-starred review? This happens with (almost) every film! At least it is honest and so because of it being a low-starred (5-1 stars) review, as in only 1 star, review it will probably/ more than likely get buried!)",1,4,7,15 July 2016
The Color of Money," Ex-player/hustler uses a young prot√©g√©e to get himself back playing.
","Having just sat and watched it, it is not as good as I remembered it to be. There was a time when I would have given this film a mark of 10/10 but having just seen it again that has dropped to 5.The storyline is boring, the film is nothing more than OK, and unfortunately there was absolutely no way of typing a summary without telling you readers exactly what happens in the film from the start, to the finish.Thankfully the leads do the best that they can with the awful script and it is down to them that the film is nothing more than watchable. I don't think other actors could have done that and kept the film watchable because even though they would have done *their* best with the script, *their* best would not have been good enough. It's the difference between watching (for example) Dustin Hoffman, who, lets face it, is a wonderful actor, and Hugh Grant, who, lets face it, is not. So it is thanks to the leads acting abilities that I would recommend you see the film just to watch them perform a minor miracle and turn what should have been a lame duck into the mediocrity that it is.",5,1,7,22 August 2005
The Amazing Spider-Man," What an amazingly poor reboot!
","Even if you take this film as a film in it's own right it would still be a terrible film but then you can't take it as a film in it's own right as it's a reboot so you have to compare it to what has gone before. OK so lets do that. Compared to what has gone before this film is boring, tedious, long drawn out, far too long, extremely messy, There is only one good scene in the whole film and it is a very short one in the school where Spiderman and The Lizard are fighting in the school and enter a classroom with a teacher in who is listening to music absolutely oblivious to the fact the two of them are fighting behind him. That is the ONLY good scene in the film and it lasts for about thirty seconds to about one minute! The one line of sarcastic wit is also said in the fight in the schoolAs much as I hate to say it because it's nice to finally see Hollywood casting an English actor (well, I say English because although born in America he was brought up in England) in a lead role that isn't the villain Andrew Garfield did not fit the role at all! But then he, like any actor, can only do the best that they can with the script that they are given and the script in this film was awful, and so was the directing which also doesn't make an actor look good on, screen none of it helped make him the right man for the job! Emma Stone dyed her hair for this role. What she should have done was dyed it for another role if she wanted to dye it so badly at all! Again, her part, like all of them was lifeless and therefore tedious to watch and in this version the character of Gwen Stacy got to know Peter Parker and Spiderman are one and the same person even though that NEVER happened in the comics as the only girlfriend so far that got to know who was under the mask was Mary- Jane Watson. Gwen's father and a child in a car also got to know who was under the mask and that should not have happened!oh and I keep getting the feeling that I'm watching a parallel universe with the Marvel universe films as the Toby Maguire films were pretty much true to the comic books but this film? Almost nothing like them! THIS IS TO BE CONTINUED!",1,5,19,12 April 2013
How to Train Your Dragon 2," There was ABSOLUTELY NOTHING GOOD about this film!
","I implore you to OK read the good reviews if you really feel the need to but I implore you to ignore them or at the very worst do not believe them! think the (exact) opposite of what the people have typed in the good reviews and you will have some idea as to just how truly awful this film is! The storyline is virtually non-existent, there are strange things that happen through the film that wouldn't happen at all if the writers and animators had looked it through thoroughly before they started making the film, while making the film and just before finishing making the film they would have seen these problems and removed them so that their work wouldn't look sloppy unless of course they wanted their work to look sloppy in which case they did a truly brilliant job! For example, Hiccup comes across an area that after this part we learn is an area protected by the Alpha dragon who keeps the area safe and helps keep all of the dragons there happy. Well in this area when Hiccup first comes across it with his girlfriend (whose character has changed and is now completely the opposite to what it was in the first film, but then everyone's character has changed and so have the way some look!) there are dragon trappers there who surprise surprise blame Hiccup for the damaged caused to their fort/home/living area. Now as the area is protected by the Alpha dragon why is it that the trappers are (allowed to be) in the same area as the Alpha dragon while they are dragon trapping all of the dragons? Surely the Alpha dragon, the king of all dragons (as Hiccup was told he is by his Mother) would have seen them off? but he happily allows them to stay in the area trapping dragons for Drago! It was never explained why they were trapping dragons for him which was another strange thing about the film! Oh and then there's the strange thing where we find out Hiccup is now 20 years and his dragon, Toothless, is as old as him even though four years ago it was a baby! then there is the strange thing where his mother..... Nope I'm not going to go through every single anomaly in the film as there are lots of them, far too many in fact as there shouldn't be any at all! All of the anomalies, the characters' characters changing, some of their looks changing, a plot line that is thinner than a single ply tissue and is extremely and exceedingly boring, characters that if they were not in the film would not make the slightest bit of difference to anything, the fact that it tries to cater for everyone and in doing so ends up not really catering for anyone (ok so it does cater for everyone but only slightly/a little bit in each case, not enough to see the it through to the end) are only a few of MANY problems in this dreadful, dreadful, dreadful sequel! Save yourself the disappointment! DO NOT WATCH THIS GIGANTIC PILE OF ****!",Null,2,7,6 April 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Witty?!?!?!?! Witty?!?!?!?! Witty?!?!?!?! What the flip was witty in that film?!?!?!?!
","There is absolutely NOTHING witty in this film! Witty is NOT a word I would use to describe this film! Boring, tedious, dreadful, Very overly long, these are all the sorts of words that describe the film, not witty!!!!!!!! The cameos from all of those people were far from necessary! The makers, the writer and director etc. obviously thought 'Hmmm how can we get this crap to sell? How can we bring the viewers in? Cameos! And over-hyping! That's what we need! We need lots of cameos by lots of different actors and actresses and lots and lots and lots and....of over-hyping! If we offer enough money and they have room in their diaries.... and if we hype this rubbish as much as we possibly can....' and lo viewers came in their hundreds and thousands and spent a huge heap of money on a truly dire film! And as awards ceremonies such as the Academy Awards are just advertising and promotion(al) vehicles no wonder this crap film won awards in various places, it needed them! Oh, and if any proof was needed that we humans are all sheep then the fact that so many people flocked to see this rubbish and then actually watched it and then rated it so highly and gave it such good/great reviews proves it! There was such a long gap between plot points causing the film to feel very slow and very lumbered! Every time I have tried to see the film I have fallen asleep! Ralph Fiennes was good and carried the film. Thanks to all of the sheep flocking to the cinemas I bet Ralph, and the rest of the cast, is now pleased this crap is on his, and her, C. V.!",2,3,7,16 February 2015
The Number 23," There is NO DOUBT that this is a MUST-SEE film!!!!!!!!!
","First of all, let me say this. YOU MUST IGNORE ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE GIVEN THIS FILM A RATING OF FIVE OUT OF TEN OR LOWER BECAUSE, TO PUT IT IN A WAY THAT WILL BE ALLOWED ON THIS WEBSITE, THEY ARE TALKING OUT OF THEIR BOTTOMS! GO AND SEE THE FILM (LIKE I DID), ENJOY IT (LIKE I DID), THEN COME BACK AND LAUGH AT THEM, (LIKE I DID) AND WRITE A GOOD OR BETTER REVIEW FOR IT ON I. M. D. B. (LIKE I DID)! To all those that gave this piece of wonderful cinematic viewing a rubbish score YOU HAVE EITHER MISSED THE POINT TO THE FILM OR MISSED THE INTRICATE STORYLINE OR BOTH, *COMPLETELY*! I even read one review from someone that only gave it one star that couldn't see what the dog was all about. If that reviewer reads this....IT WAS A STRAY DOG THAT, AS A DOG-CATCHER HE WAS SUPPOSED TO CATCH! THAT AND THAT THE DOG'S NAME ADDED UP TO TWENTY-THREE! Oh and to the reviewer that wonders why it is that if he loves the book given to him on his birthday by his wife Agatha as it only has twenty pages in it, well there are two things wrong with that. The first is that IT HAS MORE THAN TWENTY PAGES IN IT, AND THE SECOND IS THAT Every time HE COMES Across A PART THAT IS SIMILAR TO OR MATCHES/MIRRORS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED IN HIS LIFE HE GOES OFF AND THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATES IT AND EVERYTHING THAT IS CONNECTED TO IT! I don't often give films a 10 rating but I have with this one and boy does it deserve it! Everyone plays their part perfectly and Jim Carrey proves once again that his ability to act in straight roles is just as good as his ability to act in comedic ones.I'm not going to type much more as I might end up putting in plot spoilers and that wouldn't be too nice for you all that are yet to see the film and if, when you do go to see it, you think the ending is a bit wishy-washy then you have missed the point of that as well!I would write a paragraph stating what the point of the ending was and how it fitted the film perfectly but then that would mean typing plot spoilers and I don't want there to be any spoilers in this review!",10,2,6,16 November 2007
This Is Spinal Tap," One of a kind!
",There is still no film like it and the way things are going I doubt if there ever will be! it is truly a phenomenal and phenomenally funny piece of cinematic history! If you don't sit and laugh then you have no sense of humour!there are so many funny bits in it it would all take too long to put them down here so here are just three of the very many: The band think they are just that bit better than everyone else out there in the world of music and therefore be just that bit louder so they have an amplifier that goes up to 11! or when one of the band draws something to scale on a paper napkin/serviette only for the stage set designers think it has been drawn full size so that is what ends up on stage at the front of the stage! Or when the four of them come up through the stage in plastic tubes only for one to not open at the start of the song or during any part of it and ends up needing to be rescued by stage hands! This is a must have film!,10,0,2,15 January 2013
Beauty and the Beast," 'WHAT A LOAD OF SH
","Even though this film is sh I still want it in my Disney collection! Emma Watson still can not act just like so many others but she'll keep getting main parts because of who she is just like so many others! Thankfully there are enough people in the film who can and that alone would make the film worth watching but with the film being so dreadful with wonderful iconic scenes being taken out and others replaced with ones that are not as good and the pace has been greatly slowed down in comparison to the original cartoon. It's a great film to help you fall asleep. Oh, hey, I've just realised something good about this film.... it's a great film to help you fall asleep! The film has been extended to a very unnecessary ridiculous two hours four minutes, which means there is thirty-two minutes of unnecessary ridiculous dialogue.

This sickeningly sweet piece of you-know-what-is-coming-from-the-moment-you-sit-down-and-start watching-the-film awfulness is so dire I really just wanted to shoot both of the main cast just to change the fact that this film was does more than stating the obvious, it shows every bad clich√© (pronounced cleeshay) that the director could fit in. A wealthy business man picks up a prostitute, the fittest healthiest prostitute to have ever walked the streets by the look of her, falls in love with her, and ends up as her sugar-daddy, showering her with gifts. She on the other hand stays a prostitute as instead of selling her body to him for money she is now doing it for gifts. I seriously cannot say just how bad this film is!",1,8,19,8 May 2008
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Do not waste your time with this!
","I have seen so many dreadful films recently, this is yet another one to add to the list! It is veeeeeeerrrrrrryyyyyyyyy loooooonnnnnngggggggg annnnnnnd veeeeeeerrrrrryyyyyyyyy boooooooorrrrrrriiiiiiinnnnnnnnngggggggg! I cant help wondering if this film isn't (auto)biographical in some way as like his character hadn't really been seen since playing Birdman Michael Keaton hasn't been seen since he played Batman and now he like his character are struggling to become known again. Thanks to this turd winning an Academy award Keaton has succeeded.I am not surprised this turd won Academy awards as they are basically adverts. How many times have we seen a film that no-one has really heard of or really seen won one of the major awards such as best director and then been re-released because the studio knows people will, as they do, now go and watch it saying things like ' oh it's just won the best director award, lest go and see why. After all, it must be good if it got the award for best director....' Even just being nominated is enough of an advert! In this case they obviously wanted to give Michael Keaton's career a boost. I wouldn't be surprised if Kevin Costner is in a film where he is nominated for and the film wins something next! There is no explanation as to why Keaton's character, (Riggan), can do things such as turn the television off just by pointing at it with his finger or cause books to fly across the room by waving his arms. it is ridiculous! Not one person gave a performance of any note. Zack Galifianakis might as well have not been in the film as he doesn't appear until right near the end for maybe as long as two or three minutes when Riggan is lying in a hospital bed. now I come to think of it, almost the entire film was Michael Keaton the rest of the cast were in it so little that never mind them being called co-stars, they should really be called bit-part stars! I wouldn't be at all surprised if they all did have larger parts but the director and his dreadful directing cut them right back as far as he possibly could in order to reduce the length of the film which thanks to the rubbish he left in is still almost two hours long, it's just not two hours long in an anything good way! This is very much a MUST-NOT-SEE under every circumstance and in every way shape and form film!",Null,5,9,17 November 2015
The Croods," Very Unenjoyable!
","DO NOT WATCH THIS CRAP! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!The fact that I'm typing this whole review as yet another chase scene in the film is playing tells you just boring this film is! There is NOTHING, yep, that's right, NOTHING fun or enjoyable about this piece of animated rubbish! the animation is as good as you would expect in today's world, the voice acting is not bad, but with a storyline so bad and everything that happens in the film being so blatantly obvious, unless you really want to sit and watch yet another film so full of tedium and so full of everything in it being a copy of what has been done countless times before, AVOID WATCHING THIS! with a lot of the blatantly obvious coming from children's cartoons of the 60s, 70s, and 80s!

The Cabin in the Woods," A film so dull, so ridiculous I kept dozing off through it!
","It is supposed to be a horror-comedy but there is no comedy in it whatsoever! What there is in it is one very long list of unanswered questions and here are just a few of them: If the jock's (Curt's) Uncle owns the cabin then how did the scientists and the organisation they work for get in there to put cameras everywhere inside and out around the cabin? 
If the Uncle works for the organisation then why would he have allowed them to stay How would he have not known about what was going to happen when they go there? 
What is the organisation?
How did the organisation know that the ones going were just what they needed?
How did they get the undead family to kill them in the correct order?
If it weren't down to them then how did the undead know the correct order to kill them in?
How is it that the students don't bleed like a person would? 
How is it that the students appear to be immune to serious injury?
Why does the film not make it obvious who is which character? the only one that was was the stoner.
Why later in the film are the characters of the jock and the nerd swap with each other? 
How could the virgin possibly be a virgin when she was seeing a collage professor for some extra curricular activities?
Seeing as how she's not actually a virgin, how would sacrificing her last to save the world make any difference?
 
I could keep going with even more questions that this stupid film leaves unanswered but I think that's enough for now!Honestly, if you want proper, brilliant horror-comedy, watch the three Scream film or for decent horror-comedy the three I Know What You Did Last Summer films. Ok so the three I Know What You Did Last Summer films aren't quite as good as Scream, the second and third films inexplicably got very poor ratings on here and on Rotten Tomatoes. The poor ratings are ludicrous as they are actually rather good meaning/making all six film so massively better than this rubbish!",1,2,4,29 April 2018
