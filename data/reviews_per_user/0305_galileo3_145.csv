The King's Speech," One of the best films of 2010. Beautifully made, with a stunning performance from Colin Firth
","The King's Speech Top 5 - 2010 I am not a big fan of Royal dramas or period pieces generally. They often focus on technical beauty, often neglecting character and plot. The King's Speech is a definite exception. A perfectly crafted, beautiful film that fills you with joy. The central characters are beautifully humanised by Colin Firth (King George VI), Geoffrey Rush (Lionel Logue) and Helena Bonham Carter (Elizabeth). All of the lead performances are of Oscar calibre. This is the story of Prince Albert, Duke of York, who became King George VI, but struggled to correct his speech problems - his stammering unsettles many people, and 'Bertie' needed to solve it for his King's speech to the nation. Many elite doctors come and go, without success in solving the stammering. Until Prince Albert, meets Lionel Logue, an Australian speech therapist whose methods are unorthodox and his approach a bit informal towards royalty. When Prince Albert visits Logue's office in Harley Street, Logue informs him - 'My Castle, My Rules'. From thereon, an uneasy relationship at first, blossoms into an unusual friendship, as Logue puts his heart into helping 'Bertie' (as he calls him - 'Bertie' is only for the family). Beautiful direction, cinematography, art production and a fine script that is both funny and emotionally touching, the King's Speech is a crowd-pleaser without being cheap entertainment. A very good film.9/10",8,0,1,29 January 2011
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," An alluring, exotic, dynamic, rough modern masterpiece
","Kill Bill Vol 2 (2004) One of my top 5 films of 2004Tarantino hits the nerve, raises the bar, reduces the violence, increases the humour only to create a dynamic and superior sequel to Kill Bill vol 1.Kill Bill is a visual splendour, the ultimate part of the saga of the Bride in search of the remaining names on her list. ELLE, BUDD, BILL.Not much about the story, but about the fascinating things Tarantino's camera shows us; fascinating images, characters, words.The last 30 minutes of the film have Tarantino playing with the script, including his usual irrelevant things, as he has Bill talk about Superman in detail. Then again, why do we see films. To be entertained. QT knows how to entertain and this is no different.Kill Bill 2 is a thrilling experience a wonderful contrast to the first part; this is a calmer more philosophical film rather than a violent, vulgar and graphic first part. They fit together perfectly; like COLD neutralising HOT. They complete a fascinating duo of films.KILL BILL VOLUME 1 - 7/10 KILL BILL VOLUME 2 - 9/10",9,2,4,22 August 2007
Vertigo," Hitchcock's exquisitely mysterious masterpiece.
","Vertigo (1958) Number 1 - 1958 Top 5 - 1950s Top 100 - All Time Vertigo displays Sir Alfred Hitchcock's mastery to frighten, surprise and tantalise at its highest level - this is a triumph not only in its genre but as a cinematic landmark in creative, modern cinematic attitudes.Of course, like most of Hitchcock's films,Vertigo, upon its release it was met with mixed reviews. Variety magazine said said the film showed Hitchcock's 'mastery', but was too long and slow for 'what is basically only a psychological murder mystery'. However as time passed, Vertigo was met with vigorous excitement and favourability and has since become a classic, analysed and re-analysed so many times.The story of an acrophobic detective (James Stewart), who retires from the force and is later hired by a wealthy businessman to observe his wife's bizarre behaviour, claiming that she might be possessed. However, the truth is far from that as John 'Scottie' Ferguson realises as time passes and in true Hitchcockian fashion, the ride is thrilling from start to finish.Cinematic excellence, one of Hitchcock's finest films, highly recommended.10/10",10,5,6,18 February 2008
Black Swan," An intoxicating masterpiece... Natalie Portman is positively breathtaking
","Black Swan Darren Aronofsky has a certain ability to drill down to the deepest chasms of the human psyche - we have seen it in his heartbreaking masterpiece, Requiem for A Dream, and his last powerhouse, The Wrestler. With Black Swan he goes about investigating obsession, compulsion, fascination, psychosis and jealousy under the cover of the world of ballet. More specifically, during a production of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake.The story revolves around Nina, and her quest to master the poetic contrasts of both the White Swan and the Black Swan. Surrounding Nina are her controlling and envious former ballerina mother, her ballet instructor, and Lily who is essentially a dark reflection of Nina's personality, or so she projects. Black Swan is high art cinema, combining operatic age old themes of competition, and destruction in the quest for perfection for the arts. The film is a psychosexual thriller, I guess, and is claustrophobic and intense enough to delve into horror territory at times. No review of Black Swan, however will provide a fair assessment if it omits to mention Natalie Portman... Her performance is breathtaking and intensely visualised. This was such a draining role to play - a ballerina, suffering the rigours of the process and the mental strains she undergoes. This is a masterful performance. If she does not win the Academy Award for Best Actress, it will surely be a tragedy.If you want a truly different, engaging and fulfilling time at the cinema, which does not involve CGI Monsters or 3D superheroes, Black Swan is well worth your time. Breathtaking, mesmerising cinema. 10/10",9,3,6,26 January 2011
Changeling," Eastwood has once again produced a masterwork. Simply one of the finest offerings of the year...
","Changeling (2008)Top 10 - 2008Clint Eastwood has once again proved his directorial achievements with this mature, excellent motion picture about a single mother whose son is abducted in 1920s Los Angeles. The LAPD, an organisation rife with corruption, scandals and immorality finds a quick replacement in order to show to the public that they are working effectively. However the mother quickly realised the patchwork by the police and goes on a fervent hunt to find her son stopping at nothing until she gets answers. Along the way she is declared insane and put into a psychiatric ward; she meets a priest who helps her fight injustice and corruption by expressing his anger in a variety of ways, including through his own radio show. The plot is easy to follow, with great twists and turns by Eastwood along the way.Angelina Jolie provides a stern and powerful performance, guaranteed to lead the way in the Best Actress category at next year's Golden Globes and the coveted Academy Awards. Whether Jolie will win these prestigious accolades is of course dependent on the quality of other female leading performances, but still Jolie has a good chance to win a second Academy Award.Once again I must stress the achievements of Clint Eastwood here. A 78 year old Hollywood legend continues to craft work of the finest calibre - it is simply impressive.Excellent film. Simple but excellent.8.5/10",9,6,9,16 December 2008
Scarface," A long, outrageously extravagant, bloody, drug fuelled 80s celebration of cinema.
","SCARFACE (1983)Scarface is now an iconic film. Al Pacino received wide recognition for his portrayal of power hungry Tony Montana, but this was not the case in 1983. Scarface was met with mixed reviews and Pacino's performance was criticised as 'over the top'. I can see why many critics did not like Scarface: it's over the top, it's weak on the storyline, it's perhaps repetitive at times and it's 170 minutes long. Scarface is not a masterpiece, but it is an iconic film. It's entertaining, vivid and bloody. It's in a way old fashioned and modern: it's extravagant it's long, but it contains profanities, violence and drugs. Imagine a more exaggerated, aggressive, modern and less moral Godfather and you sort of get to Scarface.7/10",10,1,2,25 October 2007
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," 'Unique but not great'
","Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for make benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.Obviously from the title you can understand that this is a completely unusual comedy. Unusual is good; most of the times.Sacha Baron Cohen brings the vivid and accidentally offensive character Borat Sagdiyev to life, in this offbeat documentary/comedy. Ironically, Cohen cleverly makes fun of the United States more that he does make fun of Kazakhstan. It is a journey through America's suburbs and the psychological responses of the people to an unusual figure.'Occasionally funny. Not a masterpiece of comedy, nonetheless an enjoyable experience''Cohen is a credible comedian with his own style. Borat is an example of his unusual style''You will seat for 90 minutes, sometimes you may laugh a lot, others you wont and some times may feel slightly irritated.

Requiem for a Dream," Absolutely devastating
","Requiem For a Dream (2000) Darren Aronofosky's heavy-hitting film comes at you with its uncompromising nature, and it disturbingly clear message. If this film could be shown to teenagers, it would probably have a more profound and moving effect than any other anti-drug teaching programme.The plot follows the lives of these four people: The story's main characters are mother and son, Sara (Burstyn) and Harry Goldfarb (Leto), Harry's girlfriend Marion Silver (Connelly), and Harry's friend Tyrone C. Love (Wayans). The novel and the movie both deliberately move through three phases: summer, fall and winter.We follow the story, as Sara gets a phone-call to participate in her favourite television show and becomes obsessed with losing weight and wearing her old red dress that made her feel so fine. Sara plunges into madness as the amphetamins (diet pills she is taking) give her hallucinations and fervent behaviour. Meanwhile the lives of Harry, Marion and Tyrone are forever changed, as their addictions to drugs grow and they reach any lengths to get the addictive, life destroying substances; Marion even performs sexual acts to get heroin. The film's conclusion is harrowing as the four characters end up in a state of sheer destruction and depersonalisation. This is rare, powerful stuff.Aronofsky's film achieves something that very few films do; it manages to rattle, shock and challenge the viewer about problems in our society, issues of loneliness, isolation and drugs. This film comes at you and sweeps you with its devastating story and its profound message.Ellen Burstyn's performance is absolutely magnificent, Oscar worthy material. Truly an unforgettable performance.Requiem for a Dream is something beyond a masterpiece, it is an important, relatable film to everyday issues and problems; how people stuck in the cycle of poverty try to sell drugs to lift themselves outside the poverty circle, but in the way get caught into addiction.Along with Steven Soderbergh's 'Traffic', these two films complete a spectacular panorama concerning the problems with drugs and their distribution.Shattering, demoralising, explicitly powerful Cinema.10/10",10,4,7,27 February 2008
Catch Me If You Can," Extremely entertaining
","Catch Me If You Can (2002)Top 5 - 2002Spielberg's versatility is yet again proved with 'Catch Me If You Can' as supremely entertaining film with a mix of solid humour and drama.Leonardo Di Caprio is on the run from the cops, for fraud; Tom Hanks is the man determined to catch the charismatic criminal as he cruises around America, under different names, occupations and personal information.Christopher Walken plays Di Caprio's father, in what is one of his best performances in recent years.Spielberg's film combines an enjoyable ride, with wonderful performances and again a vibrant soundtrack from John Williams add to the whole rhythm of this superb film.This is not a masterpiece, but it has qualities and it entertains constantly.

Casablanca," 'Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine',
","Casablanca (1942)Number 1 - 1943 Top 10 - 1940s Perhaps the most loved American film of all time, if not, then definitely the most talked about film. Casablanca has been analysed, re-analysed and evaluated over and over again. No doubt this is a great film and one of the finest achievements of early cinema.Featured in hundreds of top ten lists and reigning in the AFI's top 5 films of all time. I am not sure whether people have so much appreciation and respect towards this undisputed classic, or whether it is placed so highly out of sheer cinematic affection, love and respect towards its status. In my opinion 'Casablanca' is vastly overrated. While a great and often powerful film with great characters and old style over the top acting, I cannot see this film in the top 5 of all time. There are countless films I could mention that have a harsher, colder, funnier more powerful message and display it equally and better than 'Casablanca'.'Casablanca' very much belongs to the old, glamorous times of Tinseltown a film that could have been the best at its time but not anymore - not in the modern order of cinema, where gritty, uncompromising pictures dominate the industry (along with a collection of other forgettable trash), where performances move and shatter human emotion. Anyway, it is unfair to somehow criticise the importance and quality of this film, because it is still an entertaining and very good film.Humphrey Bogart plays Rick who owns the most successful joint in Casablanca, Morocco. 'Everyone comes to Rick's', corrupt officials, business men, locals - entertainment and gambling are at full force in Rick's place. Little note - Count the number of cigarettes that Bogart smokes during the film! A story of love, complex feelings, vivid characters under the shadow of war all in Casablanca. Watch it, enjoy it, cherish it. Casablanca is great and yes a masterpiece, but no way one of the top 10 or 20 films, but then again it is personal opinion that is what makes film so wonderfully beautiful.9/10",8,0,3,21 January 2008
Minority Report," A towering sci-fi thriller by the maestro of modern cinema
","Minority Report (2002)Top 5 - 2002Spielberg's 'Minority Report' is many things: a visual, stunningly spectacular splendour of explosive special effects, a compelling sci-fi picture full of action and intensity and one of the best pictures of 2002.Tom Cruise is the right man for this film; the man for blockbusters, Cruise consumes his role appropriately, in this exceptional sci-fi actioner.2054 - USA - The authorities are able to foresee who will commit murder and they arrest them and imprison them . Head of the department is Tom Cruise's character who carries out his operations efficiently to put away future criminals. We later hear that crime levels in Washington have deteriorated by something astonishing like 90%. Everything is fine until Cruise himself is accused for committing a crime in the future. The story follows on as he is being chased, he tries to find answers...This is a magnificent, revitalising film for the sci-fi genre and a further addition to Spielberg's glorious filmography. In my opinion one of the best films of 2002, and one of the most intelligent blockbusters of recent years.9/10",9,3,6,9 December 2007
Training Day," 'An intense and uncompromising crime thriller'
","Los Angeles, LA. The City of Angels. A diverse city famed for its moviestars and multi-millionaire producers, but also for its notorious gangs and police corruption.Denzel Washington gives a superb performance as Alonzo Harris, an experienced detective whose unorthodox and corrupt methods of dealing with crime are about to come to a stop when he takes on rookie cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke). Set in the ganglands of LA over an intense 24 hour period, Training Day is a great look at corruption, deception and disloyalty in the LAPD. Washington's character, where it is often interpreted as the bad guy, is somehow misunderstood.

Chinatown," Polanski's truly perfect motion picture
","Chinatown (1974)Top 2 - 1974 Top 20 - All Time I have seen very few other films that look, sound, move and breathe so perfectly. Chinatown is 'cinematic perfection; truly. Superb performances, artful direction, wonderful cinematography, a beautiful score by Jerry Goldsmith on top of a complex storyline.There is no doubt that this is one of the greatest films ever made. A rare, vintage, unique masterpiece.Jack Nicholson is JJ Gittes, a wisecracking detective who makes 'an honest living' off the murky moral climate of pre-war Los Angeles. Hired by a beautiful socialite (Faye Dunaway) to investigate her husband's extramarital affair, Gittes unknowingly stumbles across a web of double dealings and deceit. What at first appears a straightforward case, unravels right under Gitte's (severed) nose to expose a maelstrom of political scandal, widespread corruption and dark family secrets that all come to light, one night in CHINATOWN.This masterpiece nominated for 11 Academy Awards, but only winning for Original Screenplay was unluckily released the same year as 'The Godfather Part II' also one of the best films ever to be made, and the Academy opted for the latter. Be it that it was released one year earlier, Chinatown would have won 9 Oscars.This is one of the greatest films of all time, a landmark in the history of cinema and a film that belongs in every film lover's collection.10.0/10",10,2,4,16 January 2008
The Big Lebowski," The Big Lebowski is one of the greatest comedies of all time and indeed a modern classic...
","The Big Lebowski (1998)Top 5 - 1998The story goes as follows: Jeff Bridges stars as Jeffrey Lebowski, an unemployed Los Angeles slacker an avid bowler, who refers to himself as 'the Dude'.After being mistaken for a multimillionaire who has the same name, Lebowski is commissioned to deliver a million-dollar ransom in order to secure the release of the millionaire's kidnapped trophy wife. The plan goes awry, and the Dude's friend Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) further complicates the ordeal. The film is narrated by a cowboy known only as 'Stranger', played by Sam Elliott. Steve Buscemi, Philip Seymour Hoffman, David Huddleston, Julianne Moore, Tara Reid and John Turturro also star in the film. The film's structure has been compared to Raymond Chandler's novel The Big Sleep. The original score was composed by Carter Burwell, a longtime collaborator of the Coen Brothers.The Big Lebowski has the Coens on top creative form, creating a bizarre, visually exciting modern cult classic. Jeff Bridges as 'The Dude', John Goodman as his slightly psychotic Vietnam war veteran friend provide excellent performances with additional support from Steve Buscemi (an underrated talent) and the fantastic John Turturro in a small role as a crazy bowler named Jesus. The screenplay is fantastic, the photography by Roger Deakins is effective once more and the film itself is one of the most entertaining pictures I have ever seen. The Coens are true masters of modern cinema. Although the film has been criticised by many film critics for its structure, themes and absurd showiness by the Coens, I found the experience to be pure cinematic nirvana! Excellent, surreal comedy 9/10",10,1,3,11 May 2009
Fight Club," Entertaining but overrated.
","Fight Club (1999)'How much do you know about yourself, if you 've never been in a fight'Tyler Durden Fight Club has been hailed by audiences and critics alike. I can see why. It's iconic, it's compelling and it is stylish. David Fincher's camera work is beautiful, he really captures some great sequences - and the editing is superb, scenes roll together in their raw, punchy nature, the film is good.As much as I can praise the style and nature of 'Fight Club', its modern 'Clockwork Orange' approach, I cannot see this film as a masterpiece. Why not? Well it doesn't have much. It's visually stimulating, it has good acting and technical aspects, but not much else.Cutting to the chase , 'Fight Club' is about an urban loner (Edward Norton) who is fed up with his boring life. On a trip he meets a soap salesman played by Brad Pitt (this man does not actually exist, it's his alter ego). After Norton's apartment is burned down, he contacts Durden (Pitt) and he moves in with him into a disgusting, run down estate. Slowly, they start the FIGHT CLUB. More and more members join across the USA and more and more attacks are carried on Blue Chip companies.As Norton spirals into paranoia, he runs away from this business of anti-social leadership, when things get strange. He realises he is Tyler Durden and finally shoots himself through the brain to kill his second personality, just in time to observe the beautifully crafted explosions of the city skyscrapers.It's engaging, but not great. It is a interesting film and leave it at that.7/10",9,0,3,27 December 2007

Citizen Kane," Orson Welles' magnificent cinematic masterpiece
","Citizen Kane (1941)Number 1 - 1941Number 1 - 1940s Top 30 - All Time 'It's Terrific!'When facing the task of writing a review about 'Citizen Kane', you are burdened with the question: 'Is This The Greatest Film Of All Time?'Many will say yes before you finish asking the question, but In my opinion I do not think it is the number one film of all time, although it is comfortably cemented in the top 30.'Citizen Kane' is far ahead of its time. In a period where sentimentalism, over the top acting and romantic extravaganzas dominated Hollywood, here comes a 25 year old, first time filmmaker with a bold and admirable courage to be different.Orson Welles' first film was so good it could have been destructive. Ironically, 'Kane' was Welles' career peak and there was only one route to follow - downhill; and in fact Orson Welles' never reached the magnificence of 'Citizen Kane' again, rather like Charles Foster Kane in the film, his life spiralled towards destruction in a way like Welles' real life.Tackling corruption, the derivatives of power and the flaws of a democratic nation, 'Citizen Kane' had some resemblances with the life and career of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst. This caused controversies in 1941. Hearst used his media power to crash Welles' project, he went as far as calling Welles a communist. Some cheered others booed the masterpiece. Thankfully the film survived and managed to launch its status among critics and fans around the world as one of the greatest films ever made if not number 1.The story of a young boy who is adopted by a rich banker and grows up becoming an obsessive newspaper tycoon, wanting to give honest news to the average person and nearly becoming President if it wasn't for an extramarital affair that governed all newspapers the next day.The opening shots of the film are magnificent, as the camera examines an old palace, the Xanadu, the residence of ageing and frail Charles Kane Foster. We see Kane lying there, hunching over and uttering his last word 'Rosebud'...The film is told in a series of flashbacks as a newspaper editor seeks to find the meaning of Kane's last utterance. Was it a woman he loved? An artefact he didn't buy? A meaningless word from an old fool? No, none of this; the origin of the word, which is only revealed in the last seconds of this triumphant film is that Rosebud was the name of Kane's sled when he was playing in the snow as a young boy, showing that was his only truly happy time, when he was poor and normal. As we see Kane's fortune being claimed and destroyed at the end and a man throws the sled in the fire, the camera closes-up to the sled and the word 'Rosebud' on it and then do we realise, grinning at the astonishing closure of this film.Orson Welles' achievement and contribution to 'Citizen Kane' is immeasurable. Not only did he play Kane from his fresh twenties to his dying hours, but he directed the film, produced it and co-wrote its screenplay. Another thing that deserved praise is the cinematography of the film - one of the greatest works ever on film.One of the greatest works ever in the world of cinema, if not the greatest and one of the most authentic, revitalising, bold attempts in the art of entertainment and storytelling.10/10",10,0,3,19 January 2008
Monster," Theron executes one of the greatest performances in the history of cinema in a powerful, honest and unsettling picture
","Monster (2003)Top 5 - 2003Before I start there is one thing I need to say. Bravo to Charlize Theron not only for embodying troubled and disturbed prostitute Aileen Wuornos but also agreeing to do a major film role where she was made to look plain ugly. It was a bold move and it paid off.This film is the real life story of Daytona Beach prostitute Aileen Wuornos, a troubled, beaten down woman (both physically and mentally) whose unfortunate life drove her to this horrific path of selling her body to survive from the age of 13. The message this film gets across so poignantly is that most of these people who are prostitutes do not go into it as a choice but are forced to be humiliated in order to survive. This is what Monster is all about and much more.As Wuornos narrates in flashbacks how she was raped at an age of 8 and her struggles as a young kid squeezing her into a corner with no other choice, you start to feel sorry about this unfortunate character.After a man brutally attacked her after a pick up, Wuornos escapes, shoots him and steals his stuff and car. This is her new way of surviving. She doesn't want to 'hook' anymore she wants a normal life with her naive lesbian friend Shelby an 18 year old girl who ran away from her normal life to be with Wuornos. Ultimately it is Shelby who gives her friend to the police.Theron's performance is one of the best I have ever seen, deserving of every accolade she received for this honest, physically demanding and unsettling performance. Ricci's performance is also a strong one.I guess this film wants to say that why we may frown upon prostitution, we should sometimes try to understand the motives behind it and how millions of poor souls result to this tragic fate in order to survive. It is not that Aileen Wuornos, sensationalised by the media as 'America's first serial killer' was really a bad person, it was the environment that made her do the things she did. While I am not excusing the woman's actions I understand to an extent her sheer desperation (from what the film showed me).An excellent, but depressing film. Gripping, no-nonsense cinema.8.5/10",9,0,1,5 August 2008
Mississippi Burning," A searing, extremely powerful, poignant and deeply unsettling film - One of the greatest examples in American film-making in the past 30 years.
","Mississippi Burning (1988)Number 1 - 1988 Top 15 - 1980sTop 100 - All Time 1964. When America was at war with itself.Few other films are as powerful, meaningful and profoundly unsettling yet simultaneously intense and action packed as Alan Parker's Mississippi Burning. To say that this film is good would be an understatement. There are two ways this film can be seen - Firstly this is a first rate police thriller, superbly shot, it delivers maximum impact.Secondly, and most importantly in my opinion, this film is a sumptuous documentation of extreme racism in the Deep South in the 1960s. The Declaration of Independence states that 'All men are created equal'. This ain't true in Mississippi. This film is harrowing, it is not easy to watch and at times it is simply emotionally overwhelming. This is one piece of cinema which displays the mindless and infinite callousness and savagery that is possessed by humanity. What makes us so hateful? This film does not investigate such complex issues,it rather shows its devastating effects.The murder of 3 civil rights activists in Mississippi in 1964, attracts external police forces (mainly the FBI) to investigate the disappearance of these 3 young people (2 white, 1 black). Head of operation is Mr. Ward, played with a commanding and controlled brilliance by Willem Dafoe and accompanied by Gene Hackman. Now here is the thing with Hackman, he is one of the greatest screen actors of our time. His presence transcends beyond the screen, whenever he is on the screen he steals the show. Few other actors are as magnetic as Hackman, especially when we see him get angry.This is an excellent achievement, with an outstanding cast, including Frances McDormand in a superb performance.When you see this film, ask yourself one question. Where does all this hatred come from? Essential Viewing 10/10",9,1,1,19 June 2008

12 Angry Men," A pure, simple and stirring masterpiece
","12 Angry Men (1957)Number 1 - 1957Top 5 - 1950sTop 50 - All Time12 Angry Men is a simple but extraordinary film; it begins in a court of law where the judge reminds the jury at the end of the case that this is murder in the first degree and if the young man is found guilty he will fry on the electric chair. The rest of the film takes place in a jury room where disagreements, powerful arguments and strong points from the 12 jurors are made.At the beginning, it is decided that a preliminary vote should be taken to see where everything stands; 11 vote Guilty, but Henry Fonda votes 'Not Guilty' because he is not sure - this man respects the notion of reasonable doubt and he is willing to discuss before sending the man to the electric chair. The accused is actually a young kid (18 years of age) from the slums and many jurors immediately condemn him because of his breed and branding such people as 'liars and murderers'. Although Fonda meets stiff opposition at the beginning, opinions swing here and there until the very end where Lee. J Cobb brakes down shouting 'Not Guilty'.It is rare to see a film so simple yet so stirring and poignant in its meaning and value. What this film exposes so successfully is how the lives of men lie in the hands of 12 random people many who may just want to finish and go home, refuse to look at the evidence in a balanced way or more frighteningly be overpowered by personal prejudices and thus voting 'Guilty'.

Hostel," Brutally, pervasively, sadistically bad
","Hostel (2005) Here's a director, Eli Roth, a new kid on the horror block wanting to make a big name out of himself by making Hostel: a linear film that is sick and sadistic, both elements which do not deserve praise because that's all there is in this pitiful film.This is a morally repugnant film, an 'american tragedy' in an attempt to create a horror film for a 21st Century audience that seems to be fuelled only by empty, shallow films with violence and gore, because Hostel is really just that; it doesn't possess any qualities a film could be cherished for. Alright this is a horror film and it exploits violence and sadistic elements to a high level, but come on now this is in no way a good or even average film.This 'hedonistic mess of a film', is a failure in terms of cinema and in my opinion horror, just an excuse for soft porn, violence and gore with no meaning, aim or point (although a lot of horror movies don't) is a waste of time, except if you are the kind of person that is attracted to garbage film-making.This is by far one of the worse films of 2005 and a useless addition to the horror genre. All this film can inspire is more films like this and possible worse pointless infiltrations of violence on screen and it is not even entertaining. At least, films like Saw (which at best is an average film) do provide an element of entertainment with their violence and gore. Hostel fails to even entertain.1/10",1,0,2,24 October 2007

So why not make more and more? Superbad is, at times an explicit copy of American Pie: teenagers talking about sex , wanting to have sex, go partying and other usual rubbish.Although there are a few funny moments, Superbad is a linear ride, with nothing new and nothing groundbreaking.

Brokeback Mountain," Ang Lee's tragic, daring, unflinchingly powerful masterpiece
","Brokeback Mountain (2005)Number 2 - 2005When Brokeback Mountain came out in 2005, it was instantly recognised and praised by critics and film fans alike. The film won every major Best Picture award across three continents, yet I said to myself there is no way this film is that good.In the light of other heavyweights of that year, such as Spielberg's intense Munich, and Paul Haggis' uncompromising Crash (which actually won the Best Picture Oscar), I thought Brokeback Mountain was probably overrated. I could not have been more wrong and more ignorant; not having a chance to catch the film and perhaps not pursuing it due to its nature and theme, it has finally been more than three years when I decided to sit through and watch Ang Lee's unusual western if you like.Undoubtedly on of the best films of 2005, Brokeback Mountain is a daring and immensely powerful film with a simple statement: Love Is A Force of Nature (and who are we to judge how it takes form for some people).A lot of jokes have been made about this film, regarding the homosexual relationship between two grown men in 1960s Wyoming. All I can say is for those people who have not seen it, to go forth and witness a tragic love story, which is as sad as what we see in James Cameron's Titanic between Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio.A rancher, Ennis del Mar, (played astonishingly by the late Heath Ledger) and a rodeo cowboy, Jack Twist (another impressive performance by Jake Gylleenhaal) develop their relationship while alone in the isolated landscapes of Brokeback Mountain while attending a job of looking after hundreds of sheep. During the long cold nights, the two men finally form a sexual attraction between them; I suspect this is the first time they have been allowed to express themselves freely, in a time and a place much more hostile to homosexuality than some of our modern societies today.The story develops, as Ennis and Jack get married and have children - a sign that they are healthy, strong men, fit for America to accept them. However, the passion and the love between the two does not die out and their relationship takes on a dangerous path, sometimes destructive and ultimately tragic for both...Brokeback Mountain is an important film. It daringly shows a common humanity, it shows us that some people are simply happier with a same sex partner; now I won't sit here having moral and religious arguments.Ang Lee's film is a masterpiece. Praise must go to the superb cast, the amazing composition by Gustavo Santaolalla, the screenplay by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana and the cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto. An accomplished achievement.9/10",9,20,22,31 March 2008

Milk," Penn is sumptuous in his extraordinary embodiment of Harvey Milk, however the film falls short of greatness...
","Milk (2008)I have wanted to see 'Milk' a film about the first openly gay person to be elected in public office in the United States of America in the late 1970s. A film about the struggle of homosexuals for equal and full civil recognition under the law but as well as by the people. It is easy to forget that amongst other things that America suffered to deal with (African-Americans, Communists, Asian-Americans, Native-Americans, Hispanic Americans and many other groups/minorities etc) in the concept of Civil Rights, homosexuality was one of the most eminent ones from the 1970s onwards. Of course homophobia and hatred towards the gay community has been widespread around the world. This film is about the story of Harvey Milk, a real life figure, who was assassinated in 1978, who battled for equality for homosexuals.Nominated for 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Director and Actor, 'Milk' seemed an attractive prospect. However the film, although poignant at times, it fails to empower or fully entertain the audience. Gus Van Sant's film is no masterpiece. It is a solid film though.However Sean Penn's performance is flawless - Another masterful performance by one of modern Cinema's most charismatic actors. Penn is a serious contender for the Best Actor Oscar, although I have a feeling it will be awarded to Mickey Rourke for his performance in 'The Wrestler' - Any of the two will be richly deserved.Not a worthy Best Picture nominee, however an interesting film about the controversial aspect of homosexuality in modern society.7/10",7,0,5,23 January 2009

Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Kubrick's darkly humorous classic
","Dr. Strangelove: Or How I Stopped Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964)Number 1 - 1964Top 15 - 1960sReleased amidst the height of the space and technological race, between the USA and the USSR, perhaps the peak of the mutual nuclear terror that was the 'Cold War', and a 36 year old director named Stanley Kubrick manages to encompass the whole subject and satirise the hell out of it. 'Dr Strangelove' must not only be approached as an ingenious, innovative comedy, but also as a frighteningly alarming montage of the almost unlimited power possessed by our governments. Strangelove is no less relevant today than it was 40 years ago.When an insane general starts a process of nuclear extermination against Russia, his manic executive officer Captain Mandrake (Peter Sellers) tries to persuade him otherwise. The news spread quickly and the government's top officials meet in the War Room in the Pentagon, where the president Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) is enraged at the possibility of a nuclear holocaust occurring within minutes and without his permission. A supporter of 'Plan R' is General Buck Turgidson, played by the superb George C. Scott, who exercises his facial muscles very much like Jim Carrey without seeming outrageous. The other character is of course Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers) an ex Nazi government scientist who has an idea of building of post-apocalyptic society with '1 man to every 10 women'.Kubrick's masterpiece is undoubtedly one of the most sarcastic, intelligently written films of all time. The script is sheer genius. Based on Peter George's Cold War thriller 'Red Alert', a serious and frightening novel, the adaptation became as Kubrick himself described 'a nightmare comedy'.Peter Sellers is without a doubt astonishing and so is George C. Scott in a masterful comedic performance that is equally admirable as that of Sellers.The film is filled with sexual innuendo, from its characters' names (Strangelove, Jack D. Ripper) to smart undertones present so frequently, you can probably spot more each time you watch the film.Sexuality is a main theme in Strangelove (look at extract below) From the opening scene of the B-52 'mating' in flight with the KC-135 Tanker (set to an instrumental version of 'Try a Little Tenderness') to General Ripper's sexual frustration being at the root of the eventual apocalypse, sexual references are apparent throughout the film.The character of Dr. Strangelove is laced with innuendo, even aside from his suggestive name. He is the character responsible for creating fantasies of a polygamous post-apocalyptic society with a ratio of 'ten females to each male', suggesting Nazi efforts like the Lebensborn project. This raises the possibility that the subtitle of the film refers to Dr. Strangelove as the 'I' who learned to 'love the bomb'  because the mutual destruction of the U.S. and U.S.S.R. would make way for the return of the Nazis.General Jack D. Ripper is named after Jack the Ripper, the infamous serial killer who murdered prostitutes in London in the late 1880s. General Ripper's primary concern about Communism is his assertion that water fluoridation is 'a Communist conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids,' of which he was made aware when his 'loss of essence' during sexual intercourse greatly fatigued him. He continues to explain that women 'seek the life essence' and then states, 'I do not avoid women...but I do deny them my essence'. Here, 'essence' is used as a synonym or euphemism for 'semen'.Many characters' names involve sexual wordplay. Group Captain Lionel Mandrake's last name refers to the Mandrake plant, which has mythical fertility properties. The Soviet Ambassador Alexei de Sadesky is named for the Marquis de Sade, and Premier Dmitri Kisov's last name is pronounced 'Kissoff'; literally a pun on 'kiss off'. Major 'King' Kong rides a phallic-looking H-bomb, which explodes as he approaches the 'target of opportunity', Laputa (in Spanish: la puta means 'the whore'). President Merkin Muffley's first and last name each crudely imply that he is a pussy by nature, since a 'merkin' is a female pubic wig used mainly by prostitutes in the 18th century, and 'muff' (pubic hair) refers to the area where the wig is applied. The name of General Buck Turgidson is derived from turgid, a biological term meaning full of fluid to the point of hardness, as in an erection, applied to 'buck' as an explicit symbol of virility.Colonel 'Bat' Guano's name literally means 'bat-feces', whereas scatological and sexual humour are often combined. The term 'bat-shit' is also a slang word for insanity. Although sent to arrest General Ripper, Colonel Guano turns out to be another Anticommunist who feels the Communist threat as sexual, namely 'preversion'.There is only one woman in the entire film; General Turgidson's secretary. She appears not in an office, but in a small bedroom with twin beds and a sun lamp, wearing a bikini swimsuit. The General, when he appears from the bathroom, also wears bathing trunks. Although she tells a caller that she and the General are completing paperwork, the clear implication is that they have a sexual relationship. In fact, in a later phone call, Turgidson tells her that he does not love her only for her sexual favours, and that he intends to make her his wife.This apocalyptic, darkly humorous cult film come highly recommended to anyone with a little wit and appreciation towards the medium of film 8/10",8,2,5,3 February 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Tim Burton's bloody, brilliant and stylistically superior film
","Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007) Top 10 - 2007Top 50 Musicals - All Time Rated R for graphic bloody violence Tim Burton's adaptation of the bloody stage musical, based on the legend of a barber who slit his customers' throats is no disappointment. Stephen Sondheim's low key songs are wonderfully suited to the dark, gloomy and often tragic nature of the film.The story is a simple one - Once upon a time there was a barber on Fleet Street, that had a beautiful wife and a newly born young daughter - life was good and simple for Benjamin Barker, until a corrupt and malevolent judge eyes his wife and makes it his intention to make her his. Judge Turpin falsely convincts Benjamin and he is sent into exile Down Under. Until he returns back many years later, a changed man, who has seen and lived evils , a gloomy man who is returning for revenge, for salvation. That man is Sweeney Todd. Slowly, Todd manages to set up his old barber shop, with the help of his old neighbour Mrs. Lovett, who makes the worse pies in London. The duo work together and plan on how to get back the Judge (and his unceremonious, ugly apprentice).Johnny Depp is Sweeney Todd and Johnny Depp also executes one of the year's best performances alongside Tim Burton's equally able wife, Helena Bonham Carter, who plays Lovett, with such edge and raw power. Tim Burton's direction is artful and graphic, adding an element to the film's beautiful style. The art direction is also great. This is not the London we are shown in other cheerful musicals; this is the London of the alleyways, dark, depressing corners, a city ravaged by petty crooks and corrupt officials.While not a great fan of musicals (although I do enjoy some of the classics), Sweeney Todd was a satisfying experience. A bloody, brilliant and ultimately tragic story displayed beautifully by one of cinema's most interesting (and often unnoticed) filmmakers. A very respectable achievement.8/10",8,0,2,25 January 2008
Horrible Bosses," Horrible Bosses suffers from an inconsistent and relatively superficial screenplay, but packs just about enough laughs for a recommendation
","Horrible Bosses (2010)Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day are three friends who all have bosses they would like to see expired. Eventually they try to murder them. Bateman is haunted by psycho-boss Kevin Spacey, who is as usual fantastic in his delivery of a high dosage of sarcasm...Sudeikis is left with a selfish, coarse coke-head (Colin Farrell, in a caricature), who is interested in short-term profits...Day is teased and sexually harassed by his sexually maniacal orthodontist boss, Jennifer Aniston, who is effectively gross-out in her delivery of some excessively vivid dialogue...In its general outline, the film tries to follow the recently successful formula of 'The Hangover' (2009), the three-buddy R-Rated comedy...While not as refreshingly hilarious as the first Hangover, it is definitely cruder and meaner...in fact the film hits a raw nerve by highlighting (in a comical and never pragmatic manner) the power of the employer over the employee in such recessive economic times...The film has an interesting premise, and enough star-power to entertain (including an amusing cameo from Jamie Foxx), but the screenplay never works hard enough to pay off in a greatly satisfying manner. Nonetheless, 'Horrible Bosses' is a satisfactory comedy, amidst a pile of cinematic trash of the 2011 summer season...6/10",6,1,2,8 August 2011
Taxi Driver," Scorsese's powerful and disturbing masterpiece of social alienation.
","Taxi Driver (1976)Number 1 - 1976 Top 10 - 1970s Top 50 - All Time On every street in every city, there's a nobody who dreams of being a somebody...A mentally unstable Vietnam war veteran, returns back to New York to find out that it is filthy. He discovers that the streets are overflowing with prostitutes, pimps, druglords and scum. It is soon after he takes a job as a Taxi Driver, where his insides boil, and he takes the law into his own hands.Robert De Niro gives a shockingly brilliant performance as Travis Bickle in what is perhaps Martin Scorsese's finest work.Scorsese's film (quite possibly his best) is a gritty, disturbing story of a lonely man and his anger at the social degeneration around him. The New York we see in Taxi Driver, is a city ravaged by crime, unemployment and filth. The now, colourful, buzzing Times Square was no such thing then; it was a strange place at light, not as bright and definitely not as inviting.Taxi Driver must be praised for its constant and thoughtful inside into the character of Travis Bickle. The character study is harrowing. We are shown the problems in the American society, loneliness, corruption, isolation through the eyes of one man who crumbles under the urban jungle of 1970s New York. Taxi Driver may also be a slap on the face regarding the Vietnam War. Soldiers, like Bickle in the film, travel 11,000 miles to fight Communism in the jungles of the Vietcong, only to return dehumanised into a constant war on the streets, because many soldiers didn't return to no fancy fireworks and a home by the lake - maybe I'm just going too far. In 1976, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences opted for Rocky, the boxing fairytale, an injustice towards Taxi Driver, which was clearly the most superior motion picture of the year. While Rocky, maybe, inspiring and crowd pleasing, Taxi Driver, is a rivetingly deep and psychological film, far more important. A pivotal masterpiece10/10",10,0,1,14 February 2006

Full Metal Jacket," Kubrick's dehumanising, demoralising account of war
","Full Metal Jacket (1987)Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is an interesting film. Not the director's best film, nor the best Vietnam war film either.The film gives us an interesting 20 minute introduction, as we see how the young army recruits endure a boot-camp hell through training and pervasive verbal abuse from a hellish drill instructor played finely by Lee Ermey who reminds the marines that they are 'all equally useless'. The training is intense, the discipline is maximum - this causes one overweight recruit to finally blow his brains out from being psyched out by the pervasive drill instructor.What is important, and Kubrick shows us this is the process of dehumanisation that so many young men undergo, so they can go kill other innocent people for an aimless reason. We are shown, the horrors of the war through Private Joker, as he embarks on a journey which takes in deserted places.Kubrick frequently shows us the effects of war on man. In a scene, where Private Joker is on a helicopter, he observes a soldier menacingly fire the automatic weapon at women down below on the rice fields - the man later exclaims; 'ain't war hell?'.Two criticisms I have for this film are, number one, it does not possess the gritty, realistic environment of Vietnam that films like 'Platoon', 'Apocalypse Now' and 'The Deer Hunter' possess. The second criticism is the film's small stories, some of them which are masterful, but others which are slow and inconclusive.However, Full Metal Jacket possesses some gritty and effectively shot sequences accompanied with a pumping soundtrack - one thing that Kubrick cannot be criticised for is his choice of music. In every of his films, he seems to pick the perfect music.The profanities in the film, which are frequent and coarse, are in many ways important in accentuating distress, fear and boredom.Kubrick's FMJ is a worthy addition to the war genre; it is in many ways a unique and powerful film, but ultimately fails to amount to the harrowing mastery of other Vietnam films.In the last scene, where Private Joker walks through ruins with other members of the platoon, he narrates to us that he can't wait to go home an have a 'home f*ck'...

American Pie," A surprisingly original and occasionally thoughtful teen 'epic'
","American Pie (1999)Rated R for crude sexual humour, nudity, language and sex referencesWhen watching such films, I tend to be critical and highly scrutinising, however, 'American Pie' is sort of a surprise. This is quite a good film and does have traces of originality and quality.While 'American Pie' includes your usually crude humour, pervasive sexual references and considerable nudity, it does stop and think at times, something that is extremely rare amongst films of this kind.There are some scenes of gross-out humour that will guarantee, what I like to call a 'laughing spree'. What makes 'American Pie' stand out from other dull, unfocused teenage movies, is that, apart from being extremely funny, cleverly written and having a well-suited cast, is the fact that it does show friendships, thoughts, differences in teenagers, without just being focused on meaningless nudity and sex all the time.This is a film for pure enjoyment and humour, a film that clearly demonstrates the thoughts of the average teenager, along with comedy, nudity and some American Pie.7/10",7,0,1,30 January 2008
Burn After Reading," The Coens' cold, callous and calculating black comedy. Superb.
","Burn After Reading (2008)After the violent and poetic 'No Country For Old Men' which won 4 Oscars, the Coen Brothers seem revitalised and come back with this intelligently written, heartless and hilarious black comedy. Burn After Reading is pretty much as good as it can be.When the disk containing the memoirs of a CIA agent is found by two 'lightheaded' gym employees, they attempt to sell it for a reward. Little did they know that their actions will have grave consequences involving a variety of characters (including even the Russians and CIA bosses).John Malkovich is the frustrated CIA agent Osbourne Cox, his wife, a stone cold bitch who by the way happens to be a paediatrician is Tilda Swinton, her lover George Clooney who is a Treasury Executive. Other characters include Brad Pitt as a stupid gym employee and Frances MacDormand as his associate. The casts includes other known faces such as JK Simmons and Richard Jenkins.Burn After Reading is one of the best films of this 'cinematic year' and has a good chance for some Oscar nominations next year. A supporting actor nomination for John Malkovich, who is superb; an editing nomination and most likely another Original Screenplay nomination for the Coens.A comedy about infidelity, the cruel nature of humanity and the stupidity of intelligence forces.Great fun.8/10",8,2,7,25 October 2008
Man of Steel," Plastic, dry and humourless...A total bore
","We are now in the period of a Superhero Renaissance. It begun with Christopher Nolan's dark reinterpretation of Batman in the (overrated) Dark Knight trilogy, and then with the Marvel Project, which culminated in The Avengers (Iron Man, Captain America etc. etc.). Billions of dollars have flowed in the cash registers, and now it is the turn of the DC Heroes to have their project.Man of Steel, a $225 million project, aims to restore Superman in the pantheon of American Superheroes, after the unsuccessful 2006 reboot in Superman Returns. The directorship is placed in Zack Snyder's hands, the man who has brought us 300, Watchmen, and Suckerpunch (these are not good films, by any standard). But wait, Christopher Nolan is along for the ride, as producer and co-writer of the story (Wow: gasps). The result is not good – we have now two consecutive stinkers in the Superhero canon – Iron Man 3 and Man of Steel. Nothing said by any critic, will of course, affect the cash mountains that will be generated by such films. But it is a shame, when an unlimited budget is dedicated to a Superhero film, and we get a plastic, dry, humourless product.Superhero films can be interesting, particularly when they go along with the cheese and provide us with some humour and fun: Sam Raimi's Spiderman trilogy is a good example – sure it is uneven and unexceptional, but it is funny, and pretty entertaining (as opposed to the new bore in The Amazing Spiderman).By far, the biggest problem with Man of Steel is its running time: nearly two and a half hours. I guess that would be no problem, if the film was entertaining, for as Ebert famously noted, 'no good film is ever too long'. But this is no 'good film' and it certainly is 'too long'.Again, we are provided with a drawn out Origins story, beginning on the planet Krypton and telling us the hero's story from his expulsion by his parents as a baby to Earth, due to Krypton's inevitable collapse, his adoption by two loving Kansas-farming parents, his troubles as a child, blah blah blah. I don't care anymore. Then, when the crunch time comes, we get mass destruction, crashing, metals flying around, and then again, the same thing: it goes on and on. Zack Snyder has an appetite for visual flair, but that is just about it, and the flair is often, not even that good.Another point is that, many of the special effects-laden sequences seem borrowed from other films. The beginning in Krypton looks like a mesh between Star Wars and Avatar, some of the scenes look borrowed from Spiderman 2 (note the robotic snake arms chasing Superman), or the Matrix (the artificially created foetuses in those weird chambers), and the climax looks like The Avengers (which stole from Transformers, which Transformers borrowed off other boring-ass films). There is no originality here; no author's stamp.Furthermore, some of the casting choices are bad, but none more, than Michael Shannon as General Zod, which is simply woeful and plainly boring. Russell Crowe is good as Jor-El, but is not given much time to shine. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner are excellent, as Kal-El's human parents, but they are given little time. Henry Cavill looks like Superman, but his performance amounts to some grunting and angry flying: Superman is soulless.At least, with a ¼ of a billion dollars in budget, they managed to design a swanky Superman suit. That is about it.'I have so many questions. Where do I come from?'",3,8,16,17 June 2013
Armageddon," Critically frustrating yet somehow personally satisfying...
","Armageddon (1998)It's loud, it's big, it's explosive, it's cheesy, it's dumb, a film so Hollywood-ised it is noticeable in almost every scene. Armageddon is flawed, from its shallow characters, to its outrageous storyline and beautifully sentimental scenes and general lack of originality. However, there is something about this film, that I do like. Past all its negatives, it manages to be entertaining, somewhat funny and at times strangely emotionally intense. So there must be something in Michael Bay's 140 million dollar blockbuster that went right and something must have, because this was hugely successful.Why are there 3 helicopters flying over in every single 'emotional' scene? and why do we always get that slow motion effect? Armageddon, as I said is critically frustrating, yet somehow personally satisfying and for that it saves it self from an extremely low rating.5/10",5,0,2,1 February 2008
The Shining," Kubrick's cold, frightening masterpiece of sustained psychological terrorisation. Pure art of terror.
","The Shining (1980)Top 3 - 1980 Top 15 - 1980s Top 100 - All TimeRated R for sustained psychological terrorisation, strong horror, violence and some languageStanley Kubrick, who undeniably was established as one of the most unorthodox but unquestionably successful filmmakers of his time; his film content and style were always unconventional; his mastery absolute.The Shining is Kubrick's protégé of horror, a classic masterpiece of fright with the stunningly elaborate, yet so simple Jack Nicholson as the man who must look after an isolated hotel over the winter; but the hotel is haunted by memories, feelings... astonishing frights and a child who senses the supernatural.Stephen King's novel could have not been given a better screen adaptation to his chilling novel. Kubrick's film maintains a fierce grip on the viewer for 140 minutes that feel like 140 minutes of relentless terror. The simplest of images still hold the viewer in absolute agony; hiding behind the pillow; the sounds, the sets, Kubrick's faultless direction never let the viewer rest or take a breath comfortably; the film does not show relentless images of horror, but it is the way it is made.Kubrick knew how to frighten an audience and he did effortlessly in 'The Shining', a masterpiece of cinema and a triumph in the art of terror.This film toys with the mind; it is a relentless, unforgiving force of terror. It deserves praise because this may be the best horror film ever made.And... You cannot write a review about The Shining without mentioning the thrilling Jack Nicholson. Which somehow seemed to be the perfect choice for the role of Jack Torrance; and Jack is superb as the slowly deranged man in isolation.You can sense supernatural, unnatural situations occurring throughout the film, but the last 5 minutes are dizzying, perplexing and ambiguous, change the entire course of the film. Who? What? Why?Kubrick creates a psychological utopia and this is what makes 'The Shining' endlessly disturbing. Who should we trust? Who really is Jack? This is a majestic piece of terror, made by a vivid and eccentric director, who never quite seems to give you an answer to your question...10/10",10,1,2,15 August 2007

","American Beauty (1999)Number 1 - 1999..Look Closer One of the most enigmatic and explicitly revealing films of recent years. Truly an astonishing and immeasurably impactive film of Oscar calibre. Spacey and Bening deliver superb performances that carry out the film's exceptionally funny and dark script.This multi-academy award winning film is unnerving and chilling with superb cinematography, screenplay, direction and acting make it a modern American classic.The hero is a run down middle-aged man with problems and a tick for fancying his daughters friends.

Apocalypse Now," Dark, haunting, disturbing... Coppola's groundbreaking masterpiece about man and war is one of the greatest films ever made.
","Apocalypse Now (1979)Number 1 - 1979Top 4 - 1970s Top 15 - All Time'The Horror...The Horror''My film is not about Vietnam, it is Vietnam'. Coppola's famous comment at the Cannes film festival, pretty much sums up this astonishing masterwork. No other film pushes the boundary so much, no other film is so probing about questions of morality, judgement, war, man and 'good' and 'evil'. After consideration, I do think this is the best Vietnam War film ever made, possibly the best war film ever made and definitely one of the very best films ever made.It is as poetic and poignant as it is vulgar, violent and unsettling - Apocalypse Now is a cinematic rarity. Only a handful of other films are so impacting on the psyche and soul as this film. This may be the greatest film ever made.Loosely based on Joseph Conrad's novella 'Heart of Darkness', Coppola extracts the skeleton of the book and adapts it to Vietnam. Starting in 1969 at the height of the war. Captain Benjamin L. Willard (Martin Sheen) has returned to Saigon; a seasoned veteran, he is deeply troubled and apparently no longer fit for civilian life. A group of intelligence officers (G. D. Spradlin, Harrison Ford, and Jerry Ziesmer) approach him with a special mission: journey up the Nung River into the remote Cambodian jungle to find Colonel Walter E. Kurtz(Marlon Brando), a former member of the United States Army Special Forces.They state that Kurtz, once considered a model officer and future general, has allegedly gone insane and is commanding a legion of his own Montagnard troops deep inside the forest in neutral Cambodia. Their claims are supported by very disturbing radio broadcasts and/or recordings made by Kurtz himself. Willard is ordered to undertake a mission to find Kurtz and terminate the Colonel's command 'with extreme prejudice.' While the storyline of the film is fiction (although the film is based in a very non-fiction war), the heart of the film is as true as it can get. Apocalypse Now is deep and draining, a rare masterpiece indeed.The fact that this film did not win the 1979 Best Picture Oscar and Coppola was denied an Oscar for his bravura direction is a travesty indeed.The definitive Vietnam film; breaks boundaries and sets new standards. The film drills into the depths of the soul, while exposing the insane degeneration of humanity in Vietnam - breathtaking cinema.

Ratatouille," A masterpiece of modern animation
","Ratatouille (2007)Top 10 - 2007 Pixar raise the bar once more, with Ratatouille, a wonderfully entertaining film that outshines all other recent works in CGI.The animation is groundbreaking, the best to date; the technical achievements are unbelievable, everything looks real.Brad Bird's Ratatouille is seriously one of the best films of the year. Intelligently written, witty and visually spectacular, this is a film about a talented rat chef named Remy, who helps a helpless young boy named Linguini to prepare designer food in one of the finest restaurants in Paris.This is no children's film. It is truly for everyone. There's a few excellent jokes that have adult undertones that will guarantee a laughing spree! This is an animated film that is quite simply 'as good as it gets'. It is the pinnacle of current animation possibilities. Edgy, unconventional,funny and constantly entertaining.Better than Shrek and comfortably superior to 'The Incredibles' and yes 'Toy Story'. Proof that a film about a rat chef can be successful.'Solidly entertaining, constantly hilarious' 'Pixar's finest film'9.0/10",9,0,1,17 November 2007
The Exorcist," Shocking...atmospheric...intense...One of the great landmarks in the history of cinema...
","The Exorcist (1973)Number 1 - 1973 Top 3 Greatest Horror Movies Of All TimeIn my opinion the most terrifying film ever made. Why? There are no masked maniacs slicing people or cannibals eating people or zombies, nothing like that. Like a few other horror films (The Shining), this is an experience in psychological and supernatural terror.The Exorcist while it peaks into the supernatural, it does not go to far as to leave the mind comfortable that this thing is 100% impossible to happen. Yes OK, the hovering over the bed and the lacerations on the body maybe. But being possessed by spirits? Well we can't rule that out completely. There is some boundary; the element of the film is bordering some possibilities; it may just happen; could someone really be possessed?The film that shocked a generation and laid the path for horror films to be made; only a few match the calibre of the Exorcist and that absolute ease to terrify and engulf the viewer. This is landmark cinema.Grossing $405,000,000 at the worldwide box office, it is still nearly 4 decades on, the most financially successful horror film, even without adjusting it to inflation.William Friedkin's film is a powerfully shocking and savagely intense horror film that still holds the spot as the film most likely to shock, haunt and terrify. A technical and cinematic landmark.10/10",10,1,2,30 July 2007

","American History X Top 3 - 1998 Top 30 - 1990sAmerican History X, is a film about confusion, social prejudice, cultural volatility, anger and pain, all leading to the dangerous path of Neo-Nazism. Edward Norton delivers a perfectly executed, demanding and controlling performance, worth mentioning as one of the best on screen you will see in a long time.The film is delivered effectively through the strong violence and profanities. This film is not a feel-good movie, but one that will challenge you and ask questions about the world we live in How do we approach social prejudice? What do we do with minorities to prevent gang cultures to arise and disintegrate our societies?While this is a very disturbing and uncomfortable film to watch, I recommend it to anyone who has not seen it. It is truly a thought-provoking no-nonsense modern American masterpiece.9/10",9,1,2,11 July 2007
Saw III," Critically, Saw III is a bad film, but the third part of this increasingly savage saga is decent enough to entertain
","SAW III (2006) It's Halloween so it must be SAW... The makers of the SAW series have figured out that their low budget films are making decent money at the box office, so why not make more and more and more? New traps are set, more violence and gore are available to satisfy the expectations of the audience and surprisingly once more this is an entertaining film. Don't expect espionage by CIA agents or a great courtroom drama nor an intellectually draining masterpiece; SAW III aims to purely entertain. To be fair there's not much plot, except that Jigsaw punishes people who don't appreciate life; he is testing the human fabric: on that account SAW films can be continued to be made with not much worry on how to continue the storyline. When one thinks of SAW, he/she probably thinks TRAPS=PAIN=VIOLENCE=GORE That's it...I am not here to tell you that this is a great film, only to tell you that if you the kind of person who like such films then SAW III is for you. 3/10",3,0,1,25 October 2007
Dirty Dancing," A minor classic.
","Dirty Dancing (1987)'Nobody puts baby in the corner.'Dirty Dancing has been a cult classic, and I can see why; it is an inspiring, iconic, musically superb story about dancing and love amongst breathtaking locations.The film, which explores the progressing relationship between a wealthy but kind girl nicknamed Baby (Jennifer Gray) and a dance instructor(Patrick Swayze), develops in a luxurious holiday resort in America in 1963.The film above all has excellent moments of music (including the Oscar winning song 'Time of My Life') and dance (various iconic moments).While the film never delves deep, it has dramatic elements, most notably revolving around class divisions which is a barrier between Grey and Swayze's characters (Baby's father is not accepting of the dance instructor).Never dramatically intense, however the film manages to strike a few powerful and even emotional moments, which elevates it to a 7/10.Falls short of a masterpiece, but a minor classic.7/10",7,0,0,23 October 2008
Quantum of Solace," Bond regenerated. Quantum of Solace is a new and very different phase in James Bond. A magnificent action film.
","Quantum of Solace (2008)Quantum of Solace is a direct continuation from Casino Royale (2006), which was Daniel Craig's introduction as the legendary 007.This film has garnered considerable negative criticism, and to an extent I see why. Bond simply isn't what it used to be. The megalomaniac villains with one eye are gone, the cool one liners are absent (I was even bothered with that), and Bond has become a full on action hero, from what used to be a relaxed, laid-back spy, who occasionally fought the bad guys. People are irritated by this. Then again, Casino Royale, a critically acclaimed Bond film, was thematically very similar to Quantum of Solace.We see Bond, still filled with anger over Vesper's betrayal and ultimate death; this has greatly shaped the character and ethic of Bond. He is now a ruthless and emotional man ready to explode, while still getting the job done.This time, Bond is after Dominic Greene, the ruthless chairman of an ecological organisation, plotting this time to monopolise Bolivia's water supply, through instating a new corrupt President through a minor coup.An intense, thoroughly entertaining film. Bond has changed, we must accept it.8/10",8,1,7,18 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," The Coens' cold, relentless examination of incomprehensible evil, human fate and morality. Breathtaking.
","No Country For Old Men (2007)Number 2 - 2007 Rated R for strong graphic violence and some language 'What's the most you ever lost in a coin toss?' Anton Chigurh As the opening shots of the film examined the desolate, empty deserts of Texas over Tommy Lee Jones' restrained narration about how times are changing and the world is becoming increasingly violent, I was hooked. The film met every expectation.Based on Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel, this film is about a hunter who stumbles across a drug deal gone sour and finds a bag with two million dollars in it. Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) would have never touched that money if he knew what was coming. Claiming $2,000,000 from a drug scene never proved to be an easy task. Moss and his wife, who live in a trailer park must first escape the hands of the relentless, remorseless, emotionless hired hit-man Anton Chigurh who will do absolutely anything to get the money...Anton Chigurh is terrifying, haunting; he walks around with a cattlegun killing anyone or anything that gets in his way. The person who is responsible for creating an unforgettable character is Javier Bardem. It would be a travesty if this man doesn't win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.On the other side we have Academy Award Winner Tommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, a man whose family has been involved with the law for generations; Ed Tom does not like the new times, he thinks the world is too violent, too characterless. From the character and thoughts of Ed Tom you will get a great idea why the film is called 'No Country For Old Men'. Needless to say, Tommy Lee Jones consumes his role with his usual casual, sarcastic undertones that were responsible for his Oscar in 'Fugitive'.This is a Coen Brothers film. From that I knew this would not be an ordinary film; their previous works, some of which are masterworks give you an idea of their style. The Coens direction is brilliant - we are shown horrors, landscapes, characters, times, thoughts with such focus and efficiency, probably the best directed film this year. And of course the screenplay, which is an excellent one manages to squeeze in some comedy at some unbearably tense moments in the film. The achievements in the film are not to go by without accolades.No Country For Old Men, is a film about fate, evil and choice. How a world changes but some things really remain the same. As you watch those characters for 2 well worth hours of your life, you will think, question and admire the cinematic mastery that has gone in this film. This is no ordinary achievement, it is quite simply a masterpiece of modern cinema and of the best films of the decade. Unmissable 10/10",10,1,3,20 January 2008

","THE PIANIST (2002) Number 1 - 2002 Top 100 - All Time MUSIC WAS HIS PASSION. SURVIVAL WAS HIS MASTERPIECE.Roman Polanski, a great director (Chinatown, Rosemary's Baby) whose parents survived the Polish ghetto, gathers the emotional strength to tell us a tale about the horrific, brutal persecution of Jews during the second war. This is no small achievement. What we see on the screen is not pleasant and Polanski delivers it with ruthless efficiency, holding back on any sentimental tools that Hollywood so often uses. This is a powerful masterpiece.This is the story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew, a gifted pianist, whose family is taken to a concentration camp and he is left to scatter along the empty, lifeless streets of a destroyed Warsaw. Szpilman is played by Adrien Brody, a relatively unknown actor at the time, who consumes the role and delivers an extremely powerful, haunting performance throughout the whole film.Polanski's direction also deserves praise. Technically superior, Polanski's camera-work is strategic in the way it translates imagery on the screen. His Oscar was very well deserved.While 'Schindler's List' is comfortably superior, 'The Pianist' must be recognised as a brilliant film and a magnificent achievement, and in my opinion the very best film of 2002.9/10",9,0,2,14 February 2006

","Revolutionary Road (2008)Top 5 - 2008Sam Mendes revisits American suburbia after his Oscar laden masterpiece 'American Beauty' which beautifully examined the painful imperfections of suburban life of a middle aged couple in the late 1990s. This time Mendes takes us almost half a century back in 1950s America to examine the life of April and Frank Wheeler who move to a beautiful suburb away from the buzzing city. This is Revolutionary Road, an adaptation of Richard Yates' 1961 novel of the same name.With elegant camera-work by Mendes, powerful acting from Di Caprio and Winslet (and a host of other solid performances), sharp editing and cinematography, we get a haunting look at the standard premise of the post WWII American Dream. Except this time the dream goes all wrong.April and Frank Wheeler have a very nice house in a comfortable suburb in middle class America. Frank has a stable income, April is a stay at home mother to their two children. All good? No. The film explores how the life of this couple is empty inside, with no hope - it is an 'elegantly devastating' motion picture as one reviewer put it, Mendes really masters the art of beautiful film-making.Th story involves a number of character that expand the films dimensions and evolve with the storyline. This is an excellent film and in my opinion one of the top 5 of the year and should have been nominated for Best Picture and Director at this year's Oscars.9/10",9,2,4,3 February 2009

","City Of God (2003) Top 5 - 2003Number 1 2003 - Film In A Foreign Language Fight and you'll never survive..... Run and you'll never escape.THIS FILM IS BASED ON A TRUE STORYWith its compelling direction, stunning cinematography and editing, 'City Of God' comes at you with its fearless pace and attitude, it makes it hard to forget easily.Like Sergio Leone's breathtaking, operatic 'Once Upon A Time In America' was a harrowing story about 4 friends in the Jewish Ghetto of New York over a few decades, 'City of God' is similar, but in a less romantic, harsher and more brutal environment - It follows the lives of a group of friends in a favela of Rio De Janeiro.The film jumps back and forth, in sort of chapters, following the inextricable involvement of a group of friends with crime and drug dealing. In City of God you have little choice. A place where politicians turn a blind eye on, there's barely any electricity, any essential supplies. The place will beat you to the ground unless you do something. 15 miles from the heavenly beaches and green hills of Rio, this urban hell is something horrifyingly depressing.This is the one of the very few crime dramas of a respectable calibre that show us the problems in other parts of the world. How we all suffer from such pressing issues. However, don't take 'City Of God' as this epic gangster film. It is also a very personal story about the struggles of one young man trying to escape the brutality of the ghetto and seek a better life, as a photographer.Impressively shot and often tragic in its profound and explicit nature, 'City of God' is not to be missed.7/10",7,0,2,1 February 2008

The Lives of Others," A magnificent and harrowing psycho-political thriller
","The Lives of Others (2006)Top 2 - 2006After watching Das Leben der Anderen, I realised that so many exceptional films must be made around the world that go unnoticed. The only reason I watched this is because it gained recognition by winning the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film; so many films go unnoticed and it is at least good that some magnificent pictures like this gain some recognition. I believe that this film should have also been included in the 'Best Picture' category (not to go as far as suggest that this is perhaps the Best Film of the Year!) The Lives of Others is a story about the brutal measures that the Stasi (East German Secret Policy) went to, to maintain absolute control over its population in the 80s. Wiesler, a cold calculating interrogator, is assigned to monitor the lives of a playwright and his actress girlfriend. As he examines every detail of their lives, Wiesler realises how cold and colourless his life is and ultimately puts his life on the line to protect the couple. This film is a credit to German film-making as well as international cinema. This is a serious, extremely well made film examining the complex and turbulent history of post World War Germany, a country that was divided in two contrasting halves. The direction is fine, delivering each scene tightly, the acting is very good, especially from Ulrich Muhe. A harrowing and often terrifying psychological and political thriller, which definitely ranks as one of the finest films of recent years. A fascinating study of humanity and the brutal regimes of Europe in the darkest Century in history.10/10",10,4,6,1 December 2007

I Am Legend," Will Smith is superb in this intense, post-apocalyptic blockbuster
","I AM LEGEND (2007)The Last Man On Earth Is Not Alone Let me start by saying that 'I am Legend' is what I call a true blockbuster. A film with some heart and some thought other than action sequences and CGI displays.In a time when man is heading towards self-destruction, this is quite an interesting film. It perhaps tells us that there are boundaries on what we can and can't do. I shall not hail this as a perplexing masterpiece, but it is no average blockbuster.Will Smith, once again provides a solid and powerful performance; he carries out a similar task to Tom Hanks in 'Castaway', another film acted alone by a brilliant actor.After a cure for cancer turns nasty and infects a lot of people, who become violent, uncontrollable creatures and the whole world is infected or killed by the infected, Dr. Robert Neville is left alone at 'Ground Zero'. Stuck in Manhattan, the virologist tries to find a cure to treat the infected. That is the basic story.The first hour is wildly interesting, then the film slows down, perhaps losing the plot slightly in the middle, and then ends satisfyingly at the end.The film has been questioned about certain of its scientific aspects, which I noticed as well: How can Robert have running water and electricity, when there are no factories or reservoirs operating for 3 years? Is it reasonable that deer, lions and tigers would inhabit Times Square three years after isolation? How come at the beginning of the film, Neville drives a sparkling, shiny, new supercar, when it has been lying there for 3 years? There are possible answers for all the above questions, but those are not the main focus points. It's a film at the end of the day and a very entertaining one as well.7.5/10",7,0,2,7 January 2008

The film is told by Antonio Salieri a now insane musician who was the finest in the city until Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart arrived with his perfect music. A true genius he was, but his character and manners were crude and rude. Winner of 8 Academy Awards Including Best Picture, Best Director Milos Forman, Best Actor F.Murray Abraham. From the director of 'One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest', Amadeus is an inspiring, wonderful, dark, colourful film. 'simply breathtaking' Amadeus is spellbinding, amazing, sublime: Forman has visualised 18th Century Vienna in breathtaking fashion; but beside all the sets and costumes, it is the characters and more simply the performances. F. Murray Abraham provides an exquisitely calculated, graceful, masterful performance that won him the Oscar. Furthermore, Tom Hulce, who plays Mozart is also astonishing. Classical music, stunning direction, breathtaking acting, lavish sets, extravagant costumes and a story that is beautifully woven into all the grandeur of this film; what can I say this is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. Amadeus belongs on my top 5 list. Superlative, sublime cinematic mastery.I initially gave the film a 9/10 and raised to 10, because I believe Amadeus is as a movie critic put it: 'as close to perfection as movies get'10/10",10,2,4,31 December 2005
Patton," Patton - 'Rommel you magnificent bastard, I read your book!'
","Patton (1970)Number 1 - 1970Top 10 - 1970sTop 100 - All Time 'The Carthaginians defending the city were attacked by three Roman legions. The Carthaginians were proud and brave but they couldn't hold. They were massacred. Arab women stripped them of their tunics and their swords and lances. The soldiers lay naked in the sun. Two thousand years ago. I was here.' (Patton) This exceptional war film capturing George Patton's controversial phase during WWII is not only a fascinating inside into the operations of the Allies against the Germans, but a triumphant examination of one of the most colourful Generals in recent military history.Firstly I will start by highlighting the performance of George C. Scott - Perfect... Undeniably deserved the Oscar for Best Actor, Scott becomes General Patton in this film, he delivers his performance with restraint, appropriate emotion and characteristics. This is exactly the kind of role that stays with an actor for lifetime. George C. Scott has become the man who played Patton! This performance is quite possibly the best of all time.Scott himself, an intense and intimidating personality in real life, seemed perfect for the role, yet he was not the first, or second, nor third choice for the role, he so masterfully consumed. The theatricality of the character is inspiring. Patton, stands up in his Jeep, makes speeches, quotes history's finest figures to his subordinates. The only weakness of Patton, which was also his strength was his ego; listening to no one, acting alone, slapping a disturbed soldier, getting himself in trouble. Anyway, the film itself is magnificent. The direction is exceptional, the score by Jerry Goldsmith is a pounding, intense one that thoroughly suits the themes of the film.Glorious battle sequences, military wit and passionate quotations from different times of history, I am happy to say that 'Patton' is one of my favourite films and one of the greatest war films ever to be made.10/10",10,3,6,22 December 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Beautiful, touching, yet flawed
","The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008)Top 10 - 2008The film is based on the 1921 short story of the same name by F. Scott Fitzgeral. David Fincher's film is about a man born with the characteristics of an 80 year old, apart from mental agility, and ages backwards, until he once again diminishes into the physical form of a child, while he suffers from dementia.Benjamin Button was born on Armistice Day 1918 in New Orleans, Louisiana as a deformed child - his mother died in childbirth and his father horrified by the monstrosity of the newborn takes it away and drops it at the doorsteps of a elderly people's home, where Queenie(Taraji P. Henson), an African-American worker at the house raises the child and calls his 'Benjamin'. The New Orleans residence plays a key part in the film, with so many lives passing in and out. That is also where Benjamin meets Daisy and it becomes the central love affair of the film between their older counterparts (Pitt and Blanchett). Benjamin and Daisy have a very similar fade in and fade out relationship as Forrest Gump and Jenny, a film with many parallels to Button. No surprise since both were written by Eric Roth, who won an Academy Award for his great translation of Forrest Gump onto the screen.The film begins with Daisy (Blanchett) in her hospital bed, ready to die in New Orleans, right before Hurricane Katrina hit, where her middle aged daughter reads her a thick diary, which centres around the life of Benjamin Button and her existence in his life. The structure of the film is successful and while there are a few flaws resulting from perhaps one or two overextended scenes, the 166 minute film is still probably a masterpiece.While many have called 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' a well made film, with no real point, one critic unjustifiably calling it a 'dumbed down Forrest Gump', I disagree. The film itself is a testament to great film-making and David Fincher firstly must receive praise for constructing such a difficult film with great detail, dark tones and appropriate artistic flair. Furthermore, while the film can be labelled as a fantasy, it still a poetic journey about life, love, the process of ageing and humanity, and how as the film's tagline states (and the film itself shows) that life is measured in moments not minutes. Particularly, the last 45 minutes of the film are emotionally intense and somewhat haunting. Lastly the film passes one great obstacle that many other films fail to encompass - it is a big budget, main stream film, but also a quality motion picture.A fine film8/10",7,1,2,8 February 2009

Million Dollar Baby," Eastwood's slow burning, powerful and tragic picture
","Million Dollar Baby (2004)Number 1 - 2004Winner of 4 Academy Awards - Picture, Director, Actress, Supp. ActorClint Eastwood's 'Million Dollar Baby' is another example of his late maturity to craft powerful films with real, flawed characters that have a story to say. In 1992, we had William Munny in the revisionist Western (also a Best Picture) Unforgiven, and the most recent was Mystic River another powerful and gut-wrenching film about the fate of three friends after a tragic incident occurs.Clint Eastwood, has a small, gym in L.A., far from his days when he used to train heavyweights and is living a quiet life, going to the church and praying that his daughter would reply to his letters. His janitor played with a certain authority by the great Morgan Freeman is the man who convinces him to take a poor girl who aspires to be a female boxer (Hilary Swank). Eventually, Eastwood is convinced after he sets up some rules ('just don't call me boss') for her. The story follows until a tragic day where Swank's character is paralysed in a fight after a foul punch from the opponent, which causes her neck to be snapped on a stool.Million Dollar Baby is a great film packed with an emotional punch. Eastwood's film deserves its praise.9/10",9,3,5,23 February 2008
Mulholland Drive," A masterpiece of modern cinema
","Mulholland Drive (2001)Number 1 - 2001 Number 1 - 2000sTop 10 - All Time There is no other director like David Lynch. His films can only be described as Lynchian. No other adjective is adequate, and that is a compliment. The man's films are an antidote to the orthodox mode of artistic expression: [1] beginning, [2] middle, [3] end. While the vast majority of pictures, since the beginning of the cinema, begin by introducing a number of characters and navigate us through a story from beginning to end, with (usually) some resolution, Lynch's best films offer no linearity, no reliable characters (Who is that person? Does that person exist? Is that person many different characters?), and offer no comfortable resolution (Did anything happen? Is this reality or is this dream? What the f*ck?). To many 'conventional' filmgoers, that is too much to handle. A film like Eraserhead, Lost Highway, or Mulholland Drive, is anathema to the senses, and for many, that avenue of filmmaking is foreclosed; no thank youBut to those who are able and willing to enter the rabbit-hole, they will (or should) emerge liberated, frustrated, frightened, puzzled and utterly exhilarated. Lynch's modus operandi is that life is mysterious, random, inexplicably violent, strange and, well, non-linear. So why should the cinema be any different? Mulholland Drive, David Lynch's ultimate masterpiece, and one of the greatest works ever committed to celluloid, incorporates, in equal measure, the weird and wonderful, on a canvas that blurs consciousness from unconsciousness, and reality from dream (is there a difference?). It is a singular cinematic experience of the purest kind. This much can be said, without faltering into confusion and error. It tells the story of an aspiring actress, Betty (she may not be Betty), who arrives in Los Angeles, from Canada (she may not have arrived from Canada at all), and settles in her aunt's apartment in Hollywood (an apartment that smells and feels Old Hollywood, something which reminds us of Sunset Boulevard). Soon after her arrival, Betty befriends, a beauty woman with amnesia, who apparently had a serious car accident on Mulholland Drive. From thereon I hesitate to say much more. We are shown several stories and characters, a film director, a mysterious wheel- chaired bound film executive (or something) that resides in shadows behind a glass screen in his office, a 'cowboy', a blue goblin, a mysterious woman, a surreal theatre, and, well, other things. Lynch himself, released '10 Clues to Unlocking This Thriller'; these are: '[1] Pay particular attention in the beginning of the film: At least two clues are revealed before the credits. [2] Notice appearances of the red lampshade. [3] Can you hear the title of the film that Adam Kessler is auditioning actresses for? Is it mentioned again? [4] An accident is a terrible event – notice the location of the accident. [5] Who gives a key, and why? [6] Notice the robe, the ashtray, the coffee cup. [7] What is felt, realized and gathered at Club Silencio? [8] Did talent alone help Camilla? [9] Note the occurrences surrounding the man behind Winkie's. [10] Where is Aunt Ruth?'My suspicion is that these clues are only further tools to fall deeper into the mystery. There is no concrete meaning to be unlocked: 1+1 does not equal 2 in this film; why should it? Human beings are pattern- seeking mammals: we seek order in everything – the universe, life, love – sometimes our curiosity is satisfied through reason and discovery (science), others through fear and superstition (faith). Lynch knows how to play to our weaknesses, and often manages, quite skilfully to terrify us along the way. Mulholland Drive is above all, a beautiful exercise in filmmaking – it is a gorgeous film – it is literally intoxicating. If you seek meaning, the best we can do (I think) is to extract certain overarching themes: human identity, broken dreams and poisonous fame, and human frailty. After that you are on your own. This film needs to be experienced; it is an astounding experience, and if you don't buy it, then go and watch Pearl Harbour'SilencioSilencioSilencio'",10,3,5,24 September 2010
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," rhythmic, exotic, visual, stylised splendour of bloody violence and dry humour
","Kill Bill Vol 1 (2003)Quentin Tarantino has to be the most unorthodox and unconventional director of our time. That is what makes him great and his films always a surprising treat always filled with violence and humour. Kill Bill is no different. Perhaps with the slight exception of Tarantino's Jackie Brown all his films focus on style over story so does Kill Bill; a film that doesn't focus on storyline - Well let me try and sum up the film. The Bride (Thurman) is savagely attacked by the former group of assassins that she worked with. She recovers after 4 years and wants her vengeance... naturally... Top of the list is Bill the Boss, hence the title. No more, no less.Tarantino focuses on his obscure pop culture references, the music which is superbly picked, the style and above all the frequent bloody violence splashed across the whole film. This is a film based on style not subject/story. That is where many people tend to give the film 10 or 1. I myself stand in the middle with a fair 7 avoiding a 1 or 10.I cannot recommend this film, because it doesn't apply to everyone.

Saw II," A savage and gruesome thriller
","SAW II (2005)In its simplest terms, SAW II is entertaining, it flows and it has got some storyline.Unlike other films like 'The Hills Have Eyes' and 'Hostel' (2 horrendously bad horror films), SAW II is violent and gory but also achieves a major goal: it is entertaining and at times thrilling.A collection of brutal traps are set to test a new set of people in a gruelling and perverse manner.Considering SAW II is meant to be a horror film in the 21st Century, I think it has done quite well. Okay it is violent and gory, but it uses that to make the film sickly entertaining.Not a great, cinematic achievement, but an achievement for what its meant to be.4/10",4,1,1,25 October 2007
From Dusk Till Dawn," A mindless, tasteless, dull gorefest
","From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)It's meant to be a B-movie, cheap, sleazy entertainment with virtually no storyline aimed to provide 'cheap thrills'. Well I don't care; I thought this was a waste of time and I was neither entertained nor excited. Although I do like Tarantino's style and sometimes Robert Rodriguez, I cannot credit From Dusk Till Dawn with anything. If I was entertained I would have awarded the film a higher rating, but since it was both flat and stupid it gets a very low score.The first act of the film until the characters enter the bar in Mexico is just watchable: How come I liked the first part better? I thought it might lead to something mildly interesting and the quick hitting humour from the Tarantino script was relatively enjoyable.On another note, I have to say that Quentin Tarantino's performance in this film is beyond awful (or is it because this is suppose to be a bad film, so the actors were advised to act badly?!!!) and he fully deserved his Razzie Nomination for 'Worst Supporting Actor'.Uninteresting, tedious cinema.2/10",2,8,19,17 February 2008

The Dark Knight," The best superhero film to date, boosted to hysteria by Heath Ledger's ominous performance
","THE DARK KNIGHT (2008)Number 1 - Superhero Film of All TimeThe hype for this film can be characterised as unique. It has been almost unanimously hailed by critics and audiences alike, smashed box office records and the performance of Heath Ledger tipped for Oscar glory.Does this Batman film deserve all this heap of praise? This is the most intense 'superhero' movie to date. In many respects this is a mature dramatic achievement where choices need to be made, sacrifices and characters wondering and being tempted by forces of evil. Yes, 'The Dark Knight' is worthy of strong praise, but to my opinion falls flat from its colossal hype. The film, at an impressive 155 minutes is overlong and at times unnecessary. The plot is at times excessively complex and confusing at a risk of perhaps boring or puzzling many of its young viewers. Overall I don't have many criticisms for the film and it would be unfair to continue like this because the goods far outweigh the bads, so here we go...As I said before, this is the best superhero film to date and that is for many reasons. The storyline is at times involving. The action sequences are beautifully shot and edited; the whole film is intense, dark and menacing: Christopher Nolan manages to sustain a feeling of uncertainty and discomfort throughout the film which is a great achievement that adds to the greatness of the film. The cinematography is also excellent providing is us with greyish and dark blue colours to correspond to the tone of the film. An Oscar is probably worthy to Wally Pfister who was also nominated for Batman Begins. However every single thing in the film is overshadowed by Heath Ledger's Joker. The greatest superhero villain we have met on the screen. Stunning. Intoxicating.Terrifying. Ledger's performance must be nominated for an Oscar and not out of sympathy for the late actor's tragic fate but to the immeasurable talent he has inputed into this demanding and draining performance.One thing though, when the Joker visits the maimed Harvey Dent in Gotham Hospital he claims that he is a man of anarchy and never makes plans. For a man with no plans he is a pretty good planner, choreographing with exquisite precision, the different crimes around the city, plotting bombs everywhere within hours. Pretty good for a man with no 'plan'. Just a little thing I noticed.Batman's struggle continues as he battles to take down the city's organised crime empire with the help of noble and incorruptible Lt. James Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. However his attempts are skewed by the arrival of a lunatic calling himself the Joker that only wants one thing: chaos to run wild in the city.Solid but astronomically overrated. 7/10",6,1,3,27 July 2008

","Green Street/ Hooligans (2005)I have had the misfortune of watching most of this mess on television and as I predicted it was horrifyingly terrible. Another film purely made to stage some stupid, bloody fights between a bunch of lowlifes while also trying to break the world record on the amount of times the word 'f*ck' and 'c*nt' can be incorporated into a sentence.I have nothing against violent, coarse or brutal films. Some of my favourite films such as Goodfellas and The Departed are both brutal and coarse but justifiably so.

2001: A Space Odyssey," Kubrick's cosmic masterpiece; a startling, haunting piece of art
","2001: A Space Odyssey Number 1 - 1968Number 1 - 1960sTop 10 - All Time 'It is possible that I just have seen the greatest motion picture of all time'Stanley Kubrick's recreation of Arthur C. Clarke's science fiction novel is a cinematic spectacle.Kubrick's creation of an atmospheric and mind-blowing film is something to be celebrated. '2001' is simple and purely cinematic craft; distinct imagination and beautiful artistry along with groundbreaking visual effects make this film one of a kind.The direction as always is faultless; Kubrick's pursuit for perfectionism shines through his camera work that dazzles the viewer with beautiful images.The music is terrific; the noticeable use of classical music which evokes different moods, whether awe, disillusionment, fear or panic. The music is frequently used as a narrative, a tool not used in the film industry very often; Kubrick limits the dialogue but maximises the importance of the sounds you hear.2001 moves at a steady pace and makes us ask eternal questions. While, 2001, as a film critic put it 'fails on the human level', it does communicate through the medium of images, sounds, music, colour and yes Kubrick's perfectionist camera work.This is a vivacious, exciting, confusing, multilateral film; it has everything. You could argue that it is a boring, dull sci-fi movie, but for me it was a visual and sceptical treat. I wasn't sure at times what exactly was happening, but I didn't care. I never witnessed such creativity and mad risky film-making along the sci-fi line. This film is an iconic masterpiece.Instantenously I place this film among my top 10 and I truly believe it is one of the best films ever to be made and probably Kubrick's finest achievement (in many respects definitely). Hypnotic, alluring, indefinably masterful, this is a milestone in cinema. An astonishing achievement.10/10",10,0,5,2 October 2007
Once Upon a Time in America," Leone's epic, breathtaking, tragic masterpiece - one of the greatest films ever made
","Once Upon A Time In America (1984)Top 2 - 1984 Top 10 - 1980s Top 100 - All TimeSergio Leone's 'Once Upon A Time In America' is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. A beautifully crafted film following the lives of a gang of friends who grew up together in the Jewish Ghetto of Lower East Side in 1920s New York and gradually become involved in organised crime.The film, in its full glorious cut of 220 minutes is a vast and intense experience; graphic in nature but powerful and heartbreaking in its deep and profound message. I have not seen the 139 minute cut, which is the slaughtered American version, but I cannot imagine 80 or so minutes of this cinematic masterwork being removed or altered.1921. 1933. 1968 - Those are the main dates that the film flashes back and forth from.1921 - The year that the friends meet and start their petty illegalities. It is also the year in which 'Noodles' goes to prison for killing a gangster who shot his friend and a policeman who was violently beating him.1933 - 'Noodles' ends his 12 year sentence and is warmly greeted by his old friends, who have established a solid business in the underworld, mainly with the import and sale of alcohol, which was illegal at the time of the Prohibition. It is also the year where three of the friends die.1968 - 'Noodles' comes back from hiding after 35 years in Buffalo he returns to New York to find out what happened and what is going on, until he realises a shocking truth that changes the whole direction of the film...Director Sergio Leone's one main weakness was the ability to wrap up a picture of average length. The film is an astonishing 3 hours and 40 minutes, but for once, Leone's persistence in making long films pays off. Each second of the film is important. This is an enormous achievement.FRIENDSHIP. LOVE. HONESTY, TRUST. BETRAYAL. DEATH The film seems to follow a route similar to the one above; from the early years to the late ones, nothing seems to end on a positive note. Ironically 'Once Upon A Time' does not end with 'They All Lived Happily Ever After'. We do not seek this. This is no little film that aims to entertain, sadden and then make the audience leave satisfied at the end. This film is a grand tragedy, a powerful journey, a harrowing study of humanity.The film starts and ends in an Opium Den of a Chinese Theatre, where 'Noodles' is in hiding from the Mafia. There is a theory that David 'Noodles' Aaronson is just revisiting his past and visualising his future as he spirals into a dream like state from the opium. I myself doubt that this is the truth, since such discards all the elements of the film, its psychology, relationships and destructive characters.This is definitely a cinematic treasure an important film that is powerful and personal, tragic and beautiful - it is no surprise that Sergio Leone is so highly respected among many critics and filmmakers. In my opinion his best film and one of the top 100 films of all time.10/10",10,4,9,11 December 2007
Avatar," Avatar is a visual escapade, with its conceptions breaking boundaries. Cameron's ecological, anti-imperialist project is an assured blockbuster.
","Avatar (2009)Top 5 - 2009 The comparisons to 'Star Wars' and the thematic parallels to 'Dances With Wolves' the Oscar winning masterpiece set in the plains of America, (where a Lieutenant in the Civil War era, befriends the native American people and rebels against the savage operations of the Army) are well founded. In 'Avatar' it is 2154, the Earth has been ravaged and exploited for its resources, so we take our military might to the planet of Pandora to extract resources at any cost necessary in order to profit back at Earth. The film centres around Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) a paraplegic ex-marine, whose mind is transplanted into a 9 foot Avatar of a Na'vi, in order to blend in the environment of Pandora and with the natives and obtain information for the huge American corporation about a worthy mineral called 'unobtainium' (no marks for originality there) which can be sold for millions/kg back on Earth. However Jake discovers the wonderful balance of the ecosystem in Pandora, the respect of the natives for nature and the energy transfer systems which enhance the natives' lives as they interact and respect their environs. Jake as Lieutenant Dunbar in 'Dances With Wolves' rebels. He sees too precious a thing to destroy. The ecological message of 'Avatar' which relates to our current ravaging of our planet which is tipping the balances of nature and the aggressive imperialism of the USA, reflected by two current wars is reflected in the outlook of the film. The film, as noted by many critics is standard in its screenplay layout, character deployment and predictability, however Cameron still manages to pack an intense and thoroughly entertaining experience for over 160 minutes. The film even works emotionally at times, which some may find surprising. Any flaws in certain areas of the film are recovered by its breathtaking visual quality, which for once elevates the film instead of spoiling it. Amidst a blitz of annual brainless blockbusters, most notably Transformers 2 (which was outrageously bad), Avatar has its place somewhere along the Star Wars Saga and Jurassic Park in its first rate blockbuster quality. Cameron is a master of blockbusters.With the Academy widening the Best Picture nominations to 10 this year, Avatar is certain to secure a nomination, along with Director, Visual Effects, Sound Editing, Sound Mixing, Original Score, Original Song and very possibly other categories. This year has been on average a poor year for film (despite glories at the Box Office) and it would not surprise me if 'Avatar' swept across all categories. After all the Academy has traditionally had a soft spot for massive scale, epic productions (from Gone With the Wind and Ben Hur to Gladiator), so I would not be too surprised if Avatar wins Best Picture. It would be a great thing for a science fiction film to get major critical recognition by the way of awards, because many sci-fi masterpieces have been unjustly ignored, most notably 2001: A Space Odyssey which should have swept the 1968 Oscars.Cameron now has the 2 top box office juggernauts (unadjusted for inflation) and I think we might see a couple more Avatar films. The problem is, how do you top this one? How can you make it better without spoiling it? Well, I'll leave that to James Cameron.8/10",8,1,3,8 January 2010

A Clockwork Orange," Iconic, mesmerising, intoxicating, beautiful... Kubrick's unique masterpiece is one of the greatest cinematic works of the 20th Century
","A Clockwork Orange (1971)Number 1 - 1971 Top 10 - 1970s Top 50 - All Time This satirical sci-fi masterpiece featuring the charismatic and psychopathic delinquent Alex de Large (in a tour de force performance by Malcolm McDowell) whose prime interests are classical music rape and ultra violence. A Clockwork Orange features disturbing and violent imagery to facilitate social commentary issues ranging from psychiatry, youth gangs, and other topics in a futuristic dystopian Britain. The film is visually enticing, acoustically beautiful and magnificently directed by Kubrick who should have been awarded a Best Director Oscar for his simple yet bravura direction of the film.A Clockwork Orange can be assessed on so many different levels. There are several reasons why this film is awarded a five star rating, so many reasons why it reigns on many critics' top lists and even today more than three decades later, it is an undeniably popular film with a cult status.I find it to be an extremely bizarre film made by an eccentric director. I appreciate and savour the film's fine elements such as the beautiful soundtrack featuring Beethoven's 9th Symphony over disturbing rape scenes and other scenes of various vulgarities. The film's direction, sets and costumes create a feeling of a dystopia, which is what England is supposed to be; a country where the government maintains a firm grasp over its citizens.Kubrick's creation of Alex de Large, played with ruthless efficiency by Malcolm McDowell is an obscene cinematic creation. One of the most sadistic, violent, twisted , disturbed characters in motion picture history; yet Kubrick presents Alex, his protégé in this film, in such a manner that although Alex commits such atrocities, Stanley Kubrick manages to maintain a feeling of a strange compassion towards him; no not compassion that is the wrong word; rather we do not hate the character because he is the hero of the film, or rather the Anti-hero.The film which is a perfect exercise in beautiful, visual film-making is firstly a great impact on the psyche and on an emotional level the film gets under you skin - just for that the film is a masterpiece. A theme in the film is a question of morality and the definitions of good and evil; can good be manufactured or reinforced through psychological therapy? For example after the aversion therapy, Alex behaves like a good member of society, but not by choice; his 'goodness' is involuntary and mechanical, like that of the title: A clockwork orange. In prison, the chaplain criticises the Ludovico Technique, saying that true goodness must come from within. Another theme is the abuse of one's liberties – both by Alex and by those using him for their various ends. The film is also severely critical of behavioural psychology as propounded by Watson and Skinner, a perspective that human behaviour is entirely moulded by social/environmental factors. Such theories were popular from the 1940s to the 1960s. Burgess disapproved of behaviourism calling Skinner's most popular book 'Beyond Freedom and Dignity' as 'one of the most dangerous book ever written'. Skinner argued that behaviour modification is the key to an ideal society. The Ludovico treatment used on Alex is reminiscent of the Project MK-ULTRA, the covert CIA mind-control and chemical interrogation research program, run by the Office of Scientific Intelligence. The program began in the early 1950s, continuing at least through the late 1960s, and it used United States citizens as its test subjects. The published evidence indicates that Project MK-ULTRA involved the surreptitious use of many types of drugs, as well as other methods, to manipulate individual mental states and to alter brain function. A Clockwork Orange is one of the most cinematically pounding, visually enthralling landmarks in cinema and one of Kubrick's finest achievements.10/10",10,1,3,27 August 2007
The Fly," A thrilling, classic sci-fi masterpiece
","The Fly (1986) One of Canadian director David Cronenberg's earliest and best cinematic achievements, The Fly is a landmark in the sci-fi/horror genre.Jeff Goldblum, in a tour de force performance, plays a brilliant scientist who has (nearly) mastered the art of teleportation in his own flat. With the aid of a 1980s computer and two greatly designed telepods he attempts to master the art of completing evaporating and transferring mass to another place. An early attempt with a baboon goes horribly wrong, but then better results with a piece of steak, it is not long until he decides to teleport himself; but something goes tragically wrong: a fly is present in the telepod at the time of his transfer and so the computer combined their DNA code together breeding a new human fly that slowly and grossly becomes more and more insect like.What makes this a great film is that it is greatly entertaining, imaginative, intense and at time appropriately gory. The greatest part of this film apart from the unbelievably good Make-up achievement is Jeff Goldblum himself. A tall, enigmatic actor who is perfectly suited to such roles and he is simply exceptional.A superior achievement in sci-fi, horror, The Fly is not to be missed.8/10",8,0,1,5 May 2008
Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino's debut film, is cool and crisp, but ultimately average
","RESERVOIR DOGS (1992)Quentin Tarantino, a director I have grown to admire over time has a lot of credit to his name. Pulp Fiction shook the foundations of modern cinema, Jackie Brown had Tarantino being smarter and even more complex and the eastern/western homage 'Kill Bill' saga, was a bloody, thrilling and beautifully served dish of revenge. Plus, he writes all his screenplays including other notable ones (True Romance).Anyway, Reservoir Dogs is a quick action/crime film set during a day in Los Angeles, after a bank robbery (flashbacks elaborate the story). The film begins in a diner, where the gang talk and discuss different matters. It is there, during that scene that you get the first dosage of Tarantinian script-writing; that fast, coarse, punchy, irrelevant lines that won him an Oscar in Pulp Fiction.The film itself gets a bit boring in my opinion. It's blunt, monotonous and quite uninteresting. There's not much to enjoy, as Tarantino jumps back and forth between the gangsters, who overview the situation of the robbery afterwards.I cannot understand why so many people have taken such a liking to this film, when it is quite empty and shallow.6/10",9,1,4,2 January 2008
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Pasolini's Salό is an ominous, abhorrent, intensely sadistic yet weirdly beautiful and sublime cinematic work...
","Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma (1975)Pier Paolo Pasolini's ultimate film is one of the most gruelling and disturbing films you are ever likely to see. It contains sadism, rough homosexual sex, rape, acts of cruelty, graphic violence, coprophagia and other obscenities. How can such an abhorrent motion picture be interpreted, understood, respected, appreciated? Firstly, Pasolini's picture gets credit for being a daring, mad outcry about life, society all processed in this tortuous film. Salò takes place in 1943-1944 in the miniature Fascist State established in the North of Italy by Benito Mussolini, after his retreat from Rome. The film's most evident undertone that I can notice is a graphic examination of how absolute power corrupts absolutely. 4 powerful Fascist Libertines make an agreement to go on an odyssey of debauchery, by seizing 18 good looking, healthy male and female teenagers and subjecting them to 120 days of mental, physical and sexual torture (120 Days of Sodom). The film is divided in three acts: 'Circle of Mania', 'Circle of Sh*t' and the 'Circle of Blood' - the film is increasingly unbearable to watch and as you watch this film you will wonder what its point is, if there is one, and you might be right to revile it. I felt shocked, disgusted, but intrigued by some of the strangely haunting qualities of this cruel motion picture, examining the potential infinity of human madness and savagery.The film shows nudity, sex, rape and many other things, but not even for 1 second will you feel even remotely aroused. Pier Paolo Pasolini expertly films every sexual scene with a cold and ruthless detachment, opting for long shots in many scenes. Sex in this film is not the respectable union of two bodies, and the human body is not respected but rather 'consumed' by the despicable, amoral libertines.This is a uniquely bizarre film. Many will not be able to bear it, others will be disgusted by it and perhaps they are justified. I saw something worthy in the whole picture, maybe I am wrong, but who cares film is so subjective, some films only cause reactions in some people that others would have never have thought of.Perhaps a masterpiece, perhaps a vile piece of nonsense. I just thing this Italian film says something potent about humanity and society...9/10",9,2,5,12 April 2009

Rocky, while somewhat sentimental and having being structured around a fairytale story, where the hero rises from rags to riches, is a good film. The first film, is original and does not lose focus, something that (most) its sequels lack. There is nothing much different to discover after part one.One of the greatest films of all time? No, however it is one of the most inspiring films and for that Rocky is celebrated among fans and critics alike.

Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick's haunting, psychosexual masterpiece
","EYES WIDE SHUT (1999)Number 1 - 1999 Top 10 - 1990s Top 100 - All TimeStanley Kubrick's ultimate film is many things. A compelling psychosexual journey, a haunting, surrealistic experience and a fascinatingly chilling study of the darker aspects of humanity.This is a satisfying conclusion to the career of one of the greatest figures in the history of cinema. Eyes Wide Shut is no ordinary film. It is a stunning, spectrum of dreams and opportunities avoided. This is what Kubrick should be remembered for; daring, outrageous film-making, graphic, unbelievable scenes, moments, words... The anticipation to this film had been groundbreaking. CRUISE.KIDMAN.KUBRICK. was the tagline... Critics were ready to praise or scrutinise the great director's work, and they did. Eyes Wide Shut, like most of Kubrick's films (including 2001, A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket) was met with mixed reviews. Some critics were ecstatic, awarding the film a five star rating, while others were severely critical. This is an important thing for Kubrick films; they are strange, personal, mystical, ambiguous pictures that may provoke or bore - this is what makes Stanley Kubrick the great filmmaker that he was and shall ever be. Classifying 'Eyes Wide Shut' as an erotic thriller does not do it justice. This is an intense, visceral study of humanity, the bonds that bring us together and the lusts that disintegrate us as a society. I refuse to believe that Stanley Kubrick spent his time making a film just to display graphic sexuality and nudity. This film is about so much more. Kubrick studies how the various functions and derivatives in our society cause us to become depersonalised, dehumanised and become mere primitive animals enganging in crude acts. The famous orgy scene, which was subjected to ludicruous digital altering for the American cinemas is something splendidly unusual. It is a vivid, visual orgy, a mad orchestration of colours, lighting, costumes and music, a sequence that remarkably reminds of the kind of filmmaker Stanley Kubrick is. As Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise), wonders through the halls, passing near masked men and women that engage in sexual acts - here sex is nothing more than a sinful, pleasurous activity. The human element of love and passion in sexual intercourse is completely stripped in this stunning, intoxicating sequence. There are probably important people behind that mask, hiding behind a layer of plastic that is covering their identity, and if revealed, it would be disastrous... Kubrick plays special attention to each scene; he doesn't roll them together, he pauses, like each scene is like a dream or rather a nightmare. The perfectionist that is Kubrick is apparent in every camera angle in this film. Perhaps Kubrick wants to tell us that everything is so easy to access for the affluent. Sex, drugs, fantasies, yet nothing seems enough at the end. The film is two and a half hours long, it's structured beautifully and with passion across every scene, and of course there's no denying that this is strictly an adult film that collides with elements of psychological thriller, intense drama and perhaps at times surrealistic horror. This is no small feat. Kubrick departed the pantheon of cinema in glorious fashion, with his last intoxicating masterpiece. Ironically, the last word ever uttered on a Stanley Kubrick film is F*CK...10/10",10,3,5,5 November 2007
Some Like It Hot," A cinematic gem... This wonderful classic is the best comedy of all time
","Some Like it Hot (1959)Number 1 - 1959Top 5 - 1950sTop 100 - All TimeNumber 1 - Comedy of all time Billy Wilder's classic screwball comedy is far ahead of its time and the benchmark for modern comedies to follow. The plot is fundamental comedy; two Chicago musicians in 1929 Prohibition America are looking for a job after police bust up the club they were playing at due to it supplying alcohol. Through wandering around the streets, they witness a gangland murder and have to hide from the Italian Mafia who do not want any witnesses to their crimes... So they take up a job as two female band players in an all female band going to a beautiful resort in Florida. While on their way they meet a host of beautiful girls and of course the iconic and intoxicating Marilyn Monroe in one of her finest roles - she succeeds in embodying her role in every dimension.This truly outstanding comedy is far ahead of its time and is subtly and not too subtly all about sex and standard human behaviour. Greed, love, money, sex and lust. All processed in a wonderful way that would be appropriate for a 1950s comedy. What I like about 'Some Like it Hot' is the very fact that it is not crude and unnecessarily sexual comedy like the idiotic examples we get today.Jack Lemmon provides an extraordinary performance in a role that should have won him his first Oscar (it was awarded to Charlton Heston for Ben Hur that year, due to the fact that Ben Hur was an epic production). Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe are both sublime in their roles and Billy Wilder's craft make this an undoubted masterpiece and the greatest comedy of all time.10/10",10,2,2,10 May 2009
Pulp Fiction," 'Intoxicating. Tarantino's revolutionary picture is one of paramount influence. Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest films ever made'
","Pulp Fiction (1994) TOP 10 - 1990sTop 50 - All Time Pulp Fiction is an exuberantly joyous introduction of Quentin Tarantino into mainstream film-making. 'On the surface is a scruffy, violent and vulgar crime drama, but beneath it there all elements of comedy and just about everything else...'Directed in a highly stylised manner and incorporating three intertwining stories in non-chronological order, along with an outrageously good yet extremely irrelevant script, Pulp Fiction re-writes cinematic history, with its 'neo-noir' attitudes. Tarantino crafts a modern yet vintage cinematic masterwork that is as unorthodox as unorthodox can be. Here is a daring, young, new director not afraid to push cinematic boundaries, who creates a supremely influential picture that entertains, enthrals and leaves many in absolute awe. Pulp Fiction can be characterised as aimless: a group of lowlife, low key gangsters that talk about foot massages and alternative names of fast food burgers in other countries, while carry out dull yet bloody crime tasks. This film is the Macbeth of the modern fast food culture, an obscenely poetic yet vulgar film that is so unconventional yet so darkly humorous, with a cast that drives the film's engines for two and a half ingenious hours of marvellous and vivacious cinema. Tarantino's camera-work is praiseworthy, adapting an amateurish, scruffy look yet showing us exactly what we want to see, but leaves so much to the imagination. It is very interesting that we have generally received this film so highly. In fact we consider it as one of the best of all time and it probably is. Irrelevant yet so beautifully rejuvenating picture that is greatly entertaining, mystical and funny. An example that a film can be made with such limited resources and be so successful both critically and financially. Pulp Fiction drains the imagination, it uses it as its tool of success. This is a cinematic triumph, a milestone in the history of film. Tarantino is a genius; a mad genius but still a classified genius!!!-10/10-",10,0,3,7 October 2006
The Da Vinci Code," 'A decent, watchable, relatively entertaining film based on fiction'
","The novel is just 'a prime specimen of masterful thriller writing'. Dan Brown's fiercely controversial action thriller about Jesus being married to Mary Magdalene, is somehow manufactured into a breathtaking, page-turning novel. The quality of entertainment that the book supplies is vastly reflected on the record number of sales of somewhat 60 million copies worldwide. The film adaptation of Dan Brown's ultra-popular novel was placed in the able hands of Academy Award winning director Ron Howard.The formula worked. A good film was made. With an outstanding international cast that includes two time Oscar Winner Tom Hanks, French stars Audrey Tautou and Jean Reno,followed by elite Britishman Sir Ian McKellen and the uprising Paul Bettany who delivers a haunting performance and a minor role for Alfred Molina whose work is very impressive.Faithful to the book, Howard has visualised a fine novel and made it into a fine film, recreating some historical scenes in a very stylised fashion.",5,1,2,29 May 2006

Part III, is in no way a bad film, in fact it is a very good, solid piece of film-making, but when compared to the towering first two parts of the trilogy, it is inferior. This is a further study of the Corleone family and the Italian mafia with a greying Don Michael struggling to make deals with the Vatican and legitimise his empire.

","War of the Worlds (2005) Steven Spielberg, a man I admire enormously and his work has been so influential and successful since the mid 1970s, rarely goes wrong, especially with big budget projects like this one. However this time, Spielberg does not hit the jackpot in this mediocre sci-fi action film.War of the Worlds is the kind of material that could be easily turned into box office gold. Regardless the film grossed $600 million just because it was Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise.This film looks like it was done in a hurry, so the director and main star of the film can quickly reap the benefits (maybe I am wrong). The film has so many plot holes and fails to reach that grand excitement that previous Spielberg masterpieces such as Jurassic Park and Raiders of the Lost Ark have provided us.Although there were some visually stunning scenes and solid support from Tom Cruise (Mr. Box Office Gold), there wasn't much to grasp on.

There Will Be Blood," One of the greatest achievements in the history of cinema. A Magnum Opus.
","There Will Be Blood (2007) Number 1 - 2007Top 30 - All Time Paul Thomas Anderson's Bona Fide film, is one of the most breathtaking exercises in the art of film-making you are ever likely to see. This is the apex of cinematic mastery.The film documents the life of a misanthropic, greedy oil-man, Daniel Plainview, played terrifyingly by the spectacular Daniel Day Lewis, who will go on to win his second Academy Award.The story begins in 1898, where Plainview is just a silver prospector, who finds a small amount of precious mineral, sells it and slowly starts his own drilling company with a few workers. One day, one of his workers dies in an accident and Plainview fosters the young orphan as his son, HW who he will later use as an object to paint himself as a family man to trick poor farmers, pilgrims, ranchers into selling their oil rich land for pocket change. Plainview is led to his ocean of oil by Paul Sunday (Paul Dano), who sells Plainview an oil lead, located on his family's property in Little Boston. Plainview agrees to come to Little Boston and yes he does discover oil and he buys the land cheaply from the Sunday family, where Eli Sunday (also Paul Dano, either playing an identical twin, or is up to something we are never assured of this), an evangelical priest who agrees for $10,000, which includes some money towards renovating his church.The story continues, where Plainview, buys off any surrounding farms to ensure a monopoly and he grows, with prospects of building a pipeline.There Will Be Blood is, perhaps, above all, a riveting study, of man, particularly a misanthropic, greedy man whose increasing wealth only fuels his volatility and instability. We are shown how Plainview abandons his son twice: firstly when he loses his hearing in an oil accident and at the end, when an old Plainview, who has truly become menacing (very much resembling Bill the Butcher in Gangs of New York), tells his son how he was a 'bastard in a basket' as he shouts it, in his big, ghostly mansion. We are shown how Plainview shoots a man in the head, who pretended to be his 'brother from another mother' and at the end, he manically and repeatedly smashes Eli's head with a bowling pin.Some critics have criticised the 'third act' of the film, particularly the ending of being shallow and lacking some grandeur. While I can see their point, I disagree; this is an eccentric, a menacing, destructive film, that surprises and surprises again. 'There Will Be Blood' needs no Hollywood tricks to shock or amaze.There Will Be Blood, is also a film about the birth of capitalism, along with the birth of America, in its most primitive, preaching, desolate areas. The greedy, dishonest man who tricks the truly uneducated into handing their fortunes. Another great thing about this film comes through the portion of Eli Sunday; the evangelist, who exorcises a ghost through a lonely woman every week; who looks up to himself as a prophet of God. Some scenes are purely disturbing as we see the nature of many of the cults and sub-branches of the churches that still, very much exist in America today.Paul Thomas Anderson's achievement equals if not surpasses Orson Welles' 'Citizen Kane', and yes this is his 'Kane'. The film, while being perfect in its cinematic nature, it is also technically superior; the cinematography by Robert Elswit, that pounding, miraculous score (or rather collection of music) from Johnny Greenwood along with the editing and the sound.Without a doubt the best cinema of the year and probably the decade. There Will Be Blood stands close to the greatest cinematic events in history. A formidable achievement.Absolutely breathtaking. Unmissable.10/10",10,4,10,9 February 2008

Downfall," Humanizing Hitler...
","A compelling and provocative film detailing Hitler's last days.Bruno Ganz is outstanding as the Fuhrer himself, in what I think was definitely a performance worthy of at least an Oscar Nomination.Downfall does not involve the horrors of the Holocaust nor the bloody waters of the Normandy beaches, but the crumbling state of a disintegrating Germany where the SS is unable to withstand the Russians' ruthless assault and enclosure on Berlin.This is an excellent account of the lives and troubles of Hitler and the men surrounding him in his final days as Germany kneels down for an inevitable surrender.What this film does in an effort to document and visualise Hitler as a human and not as a monster is somehow admirable. It is rare to see an attempt to estimate this dictator as a human being; one that can be charming and polite and simultaneously switch into becoming a ruthless, brutal figure dictating the deaths of millions.This is a heavy film. It is disturbing, distressing and depressing. However it is a wonderful recreation of the last days of Nazism and Hitler. Oliver Hirschbiegel's film is a masterful documentation of one of history' most tyrannous, but ultimately fascinating figures and the environment around him.'An intense, human masterpiece' 'Bruno Ganz is superb.

American Gangster," Ridley Scott's rocking, intense crime epic
","American Gangster (2007)Top 5 - 2007 Theatrical Cut - 150 minutes (R)Extended Cut - 170 minutes (R) This review applies to both the theatrical and extended cut.American Gangster is a complete achievement by Ridley Scott, the director of Gladiator and Alien, a man whose career only seems to be flourishing year by year.Not so much a gangster film as a classic 'cops vs criminals' story set amongst the poverty stricken drug fuelled streets of Harlem in the late 60s until the mid 70s, where Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), an African American man is involved in drug trafficking and distribution. Lucas maximises profits by importing directly from the source, cutting out the middleman - he imports pure heroin from South East Asia during the Vietnam War, stocking the narcotics in the coffins of dead US soldiers sent back to the country. In addition, most of Lucas' family is in the business, making it an all more 'family business', although Lucas is undoubtedly the boss.On the other hand we have Richie Roberts a police officer, an honest cop (a bit like Frank Serpico), who is determined to clean New York from drugs by taking down the big guys. Roberts is played excellently by Academy Award Winner Russell Crowe, who has formed an almost holy bond with director Ridley Scott, almost like Scorsese with De Niro(but not yet as acclaimed).Roberts is a good man, but we see him divorced, struggling to keep custody of his little son, living a modest life. On the other hand Lucas dresses in the finest suits, takes care of his mother and marries the most beautiful woman in the room. A sardonic contrast.Scott provides with great angles, an upbeat storyline, with some rocking action; American Gangster is an accomplished achievement in many categories and is also very entertaining and often intelligent. No need to state that Washington and Crowe are brilliant as always.Many critics have favoured American Gangster, but not praised it, claiming that we have seen it all before; all I can say is that I hope I get a film like American Gangster every year, so well made and I will have no problem.American Gangster is a great film, one of the year's finest achievements and an honourable addition to Ridley Scott's glowing career.9/10",9,0,2,13 March 2008
The Wrestler," raw, powerful, intense, bloody... The Wrestler is an authentic human drama with a formidable comeback performance from Rourke.
","The Wrestler (2008)Top 5 - 2008I am a strong advocate against Wrestling and even boxing - I think they are morally reprehensible and often disgusting activities. Despite this I have been consistently moved and impressed with the intensity and pathos of such sports movies. The Wrestler is no different.The story of Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, an 80s Pro-wrestler, who still wrestles 20 years after his prime, in order to survive while doing the one thing he is good at. An added quality to this film, which may have been intentional by director Darren Aronofosky is the casting of Mickey Rourke. Aronofsky initially cast Nicolas Cage for the role, but replaced him for Rourke at a late stage - that decision is not regrettable. Mickey Rourke's fortunes from a rising, rough Hollywood star in the 80s (most notable for his film 9 1/2 weeks) to a downfall and a retreat into nothingness. Rourke is an actor, 'The Ram' is an ageing wrestler way past his glory days. The actor/character parallels serve to strengthen the film enormously - or at least that is how I felt.Aronofsky's picture is an intensely human drama, about the harsh realities of life and a simultaneous examination of wrestling, a 'sport' I very much dislike - The film has a sequence of Wrestling (the version with various nasty weapons) where the wrestlers staple each other, pierce their skins on barbed wire and shards of glass and one of them even presses a fork against the other's forehead. How do these wrestlers feel? Does their job ever get a bit too much? How does Randy the Ram feel in his mid 50s when he continues to wrestle in order to survive? There is a great scene where old wrestling stars set up their products in order to make some profit from admirers. We see 'The Ram' with his hearing aid (probably a result of being thrown around for years), we see an old wrestler on a wheel chair and so on. I felt that scene brought out the unglamorous side of such entertainment sports and the long term consequences. I guess though if you play hard, you have to pay the price. Anyway, placing emphasis only on the wrestling is an incorrect interpretation of the film.This is a film about the bitter realities of life for many people - The Ram's overextended wrestling life, his part time work as a supermarket worker carrying packages and then working at the deli counter - a stripper which Rourke likes but cannot quite connect with her as she does not go out with customers (altough she does warm up to him at the end). The Wrestler is also a person with feelings, not just an entertainer - the film shows how Randy struggles to reignite a relationship with his grown up daughter who he virtually neglected when she was growing up as he was constantly away on the circuit. The stripper also has a family and wishes to quit her awful profession. The film is also a remarkable reminder to the fact that many of us lead unhappy lives decided through the need for survival. There are many good things about this film, which I cannot encompass in this review.Problems arise when Randy has a heart attack, from all the straining, brutal activity and the steroids he takes to boost his figure. He quits wrestling as instructed by the doctor that he will die if he undertakes extensive activity. Meanwhile he tries to connect with his daughter and get a friend out of the stripper Candice. Through various reasons and faults of his own, Randy fails to build up an emotional bubble to restore his loneliness and isolation. So he goes back to what he does best... Wrestling - a last exhibition match with his old nemesis named 'The Ayatollah' - he knows he may die as a result, but why should he live for nothing? Better go out in style, with his own family as he proclaims to the cheering audience who watches him with admiration. During the fight, The Ram experienced shortness of breath and is asked if okay. Hesitant, he continues, despite the risks. The last scene shows 'The Ram' ready to make his favourite move the top rope diving headbutt against Ayatollah. He gets on the rope raises his arms and the film cuts off...An excellent 'small film', with a guaranteed Oscar nomination for Rourke and possible win.9/10",9,2,2,17 January 2009
Hancock," Hancock is a mediocre film with some hilarious moments but more disappointing and sloppy ones. 4/10
","Hancock (2008) Hancock will be a worldwide smash-hit, there is no doubt in my mind. Its a blockbuster with a new outlook starring Will Smith. What else do you want? Personally I love Will Smith, I think he is both a great and versatile actor and also very entertaining.Before going to see this film at the cinema I had mixed feelings. After seeing the film I still have mixed feelings. There are several reasons why I feel this way and I will explain.Firstly the film often gets caught up in many unnecessary sub-plots, has some dry moments (although they are balanced by some hilarious scenes) and loses focus. My main criticism of the film is the last act and the introduction of Charlize Theron as a superhero. I just thought all that crap about the history of superheroes and this and that was unnecessary. It should have been just Will Smith as an outcast superhero. Nothing else. I don't really care why he has superpowers and how he got them and this and that as long as the film is entertaining.A mixed bag. Good moments, sloppy storyline bad ending, I am afraid Hancock scores (just)...4/10",4,1,3,6 July 2008

It is darker, bolder more sinister as the power of the Sith increases with Anakin Skywalker being lured by Emperor Palpatine as he slowly becomes Darth Vader, possibly the most recognised figure in cinema.Great action sequences, and we finally see Yoda in a fantastic duel with the Emperor, George Lucas has done it again.9/10",9,1,5,8 June 2008

","The Lion King (1994)Top 4 - 1994Top 100 - All Time Best Animated Film Of All Time The Lion King is a stunning Disney Classic, and in my opinion the greatest animated feature ever made, without a doubt one of the top 5. Released in 1994 this Oscar winning classic smashed the box office with an intake of an astonishing $785,000,000. This is Disney's finest achievement and probably one of the best films ever made. With masterful music from Hans Zimmer and superb backing from lyricist Tim Rice and Academy Award Winner Elton John, the Lion King is a breathtaking event in cinema that should be cherished forever.The Lion King is a powerful film and definitely one of the greatest films of all time. It is an intensely human story about real, relevant things such as life, family, power, struggle, friedship and greed; plus an array of fabulous music, comedy and vivid colours.

WALL·E," Pixar's '2001: A Space Odyssey' - A questioning animated picture
","WALL-E (2008) Top 10 - 2008Top 20 - Animated Films of All TimePixar has done it again. After the sensational 'Ratatouille' the newest animation 'WALL-E' is nothing short of a masterpiece.What I must put forward first is that this is no simple kid's film. It is also an intelligent comedy/drama, an artistically successful cinematic achievement and most importantly a poignant message about our future and the unsustainability of our lives. The opening sequence of the film scans over a desolate, evacuated earth where all human life is absent due to the unsuitability of the Earth's atmosphere to sustain life (in 2700).I will not go into detail about the storyline, however I must note a few things; WALL-E is probably the cutest and most lovable character that Pixar has created to date. The animation in the film is earth-shattering; in many scenes the difference between animation and reality is minute. The film does pay a small tribute to Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' another masterpiece ahead of its time that questions the existence and evolution of man.Nothing more to say except that 'WALL-E' is a masterpiece of modern cinema and a possible candidate for a Best Picture nomination at next year's Oscars.Superb.9/10",9,2,4,19 July 2008
Scream," The best horror movie of the decade
","Scream (1996)Scream is an interesting film. While at its core it is a gory slasher film, it is also a comical, entertaining and often very tense experience. Wes Craven's film is a success. Scream while it has all the expected clichés (the killer's behind you) it dares to be original. It is about characters who go to the movies and know and discuss famous horror movies (Halloween, Psycho). They analyse their motives; there's one scene at the end of the film, where a character is watching Mike Myers stalk Jamie Lee Curtis in Halloween while the killer is behind him. The bloody horror violence works effectively. It adds an effect. A sort of running joke. Characters who love iconic horror stars are getting killed by a local psycho. It works. Kevin Williamson's script is fiendishly inventive, in making this horror film, funny and mysterious and makes you keep guessing and guessing till the end. Fantastic stuff from a man who has a significant contribution to the horror genre.7.5/10",8,1,1,8 January 2008
Halloween," 'The Granddaddy of all Slasher Movies. An elemental and chilling horror tale'
","John Carpenter's Halloween (1978) A film made on a small budget, a cast of unknowns, a director no one ever heard of before (and was to become a popular name in the horror field). It only took 21 days to film, it became a cult hit and received praise from many notable critics and is considered the ultimate 'slasher movie' and it probably is.A kid killed his sister, he went to a mental institution... Later he escaped and came back with a mask to terrorise innocent babysitter Jamie Lee Curtis, graphically kill a few unlucky teenagers and became an icon in the world of horror and popular culture.Halloween is effectively frightening, sequential and an important part of the horror genre.My rating of the film, a mere 7/10 maybe considered as a low rating by some, but when I assess the whole motion picture, I am not compelled or magnetised enough or even thrilled or excited enough to award an 8 a 9 or a 10 (which is an extremely high rating for a slasher flick). Others disagree; maybe some appreciate the film in other ways I fail to see. I will agree that it is a solid, redefining horror film but will not go that far as to call it a masterpiece or a film of power or rare importance. On the calibre of horror films I award this film 9/10, because it is a good, worthwhile horror film with all the ingredients and props for a Saturday night fright.7.0/10",7,5,6,1 August 2007

It is virtuoso filmmaking on the part of Scorsese. It is an intense examination of the volatile and self- destructive boxer, Jake La Motta - his jealousies, his insecurities his explosive anger...This is not a boxing movie...It is a movie that has boxing in it...La Motta uses boxing as a bloody catharsis to his everyday feelings and fears...The boxing scenes are so beautifully directed by Scorsese, and so effectively bloody, they make Rocky look like a fairytale...This is the best film of 1980, and the triumph of 1980s world cinema...It is a cinematic giant...Paranoia and blind jealousy drive La Motta crazy and he often bursts against his brother and wife. In one scene, La Motta's instability is revealed when he goes to his brother's house when his brother is having lunch with his family and starts beating the hell out of him asking him: 'Did you f*ck my wife?' Raging Bull is not an easy film to enjoy; you do not easily relate to these characters; you watch closely, but safely from the outside...but these are people, and Scorsese and De Niro never look down at them...Apart from Scorsese's sublime direction, Raging Bull could never have been the powerhouse that it turned out, were it not for Robert De Niro...Here is a performance for the ages, a total and absolute immersion - De Niro drives La Motta through extremes pains and cycles, from a raging bull, to a fat old man reduced to making jokes at a Florida club...Cinema at its paramount...A rare masterpiece...10/10",10,1,2,21 June 2009

Blade Runner," Visually intoxicating - Blade Runner is a prophetic sci-fi masterpiece and one of the greatest films ever made
","Blade Runner (1982)Top 3 - 1982Top 3 - Sci Fi Films of All TimeTop 50 - All Time Ridley Scott's visually intoxicating sci-fi epic that is 'Blade Runner' has finally gained the momentum and recognition it fully deserves, over two decades after its release. It even made the revised version of the AFI's Top 100 American Films.When released in 1982, Blade Runner flopped at the box office and sharply divided critics. Its technical brilliance was universally acknowledged, however many critics believed the film lacked a real human story and depth in its dramatic nature. Even eminent American critic Roger Ebert felt the film failed on a 'human level', although he somewhat revised his opinions years later.Well I strongly disagree with this interpretation of the film - after all, this is a cautionary tale about the accelerating mechanisation of our society, the unsustainable expansion of the world and the increasing grasp of massive corporations. The film's elements range from subtle philosophical dilemmas such as 'What makes a human a human?' 'What constitutes existence?' An allusion to these dilemmas is offered by Pris (Daryl Hannah), who is a Replicant when she utters Rene Descartes' signature dictum: 'I think therefore I am'. Or when Roy (Rutger Hauer) quotes Nietzsche ('I've seen things') in his monologue at the end of the film. Blade Runner has depth and multiple layers to it, which I suspect would be fully discovered if the film is watched multiple times.Los Angeles, 2019 - Oppressively high rise temples soar up into the occluded and polluted skies of LA. Acid Rain collects between the neon-illuminated fissures that separate the colossal buildings. The city is a hybrid of races (there is nothing sci-fi about that) and the city's poor are enslaved in infected dwellings on ground level, while the rich are secluded in their skyscrapers or the very rich have escaped into 'off world colonies', where they profit from Replicants who they use as slave labour. The Tyrell Corporation makes Replicants exactly like humans and injects them with a lifespan of 4 years, because they collect too many memories and acquire to much human experience, making them dangerously human. Can these artificial beings become humans? They feel, they smell, they are emotionally attached, does that matter? The film centres on a Blade Runner assigned to 'decommision' a few Replicants who escaped back to Earth, which is strictly prohibited. As the film progresses, we wonder is Deckard a Replicant, if so he is indistinguishable. This film is the grittier, darker more violent 80s version of Kubrick's '2001'. It is an astonishing achievement.The film was overshadowed upon release by the dominance of 'ET: The Extra Terrestrial', another masterpiece by Spielberg, but one that offers more comforting qualities than Scott's probing epic.10/10",10,1,3,6 August 2009

Amélie," An unorthodox, lovely little French film...
","Amelie (2001)After hearing wide acclaim for Amelie I finally came across seeing this strange yet passionate film. My verdict: mixed. Why? I was not captivated, not interested enough, not impressed enough by the film's unconventional cinematic techniques and to be brutally honest I thought it dragged on a bit when we did really know its outcome. For me there just wasn't enough there to hail the film a masterpiece or whatever else. You may argue that it is a simple film? Perhaps, but still it's not that interesting.It seems to me that whenever someone does something strange, like playing the film from end to beginning (Memento), weaving three stories in non-chronological order (Pulp Fiction) or wondering on about strange, pointless things for 2 hours we always praise such films, never stopping and thinking. One second, maybe I just watched some bullshit for 2 hours and not a masterpiece? Undeniably unorthodox films do sometimes work (Pulp Fiction) but the majority of the times they do fail...However praise must go to the technical aspects of the film: cinematography, sound, editing, stage design and the screenplay which in many respects is very good but most importantly to the lovely and cute Audrey Tautou for creating a weird yet wonderfully colourful character. This film may have been a total disaster without an appropriate lead actress.Modestly interesting, never groundbreaking.5/10",5,0,4,13 July 2008
Rear Window," A Classic Masterpiece
","Rear Window (1954)Alfred Hitchckock's 'Rear Window' is an example of how script, camera-work and characters can be utilised to a maximum. This is a film that has its character stuck in 1 room for 110 minutes. That is a tough job to pull.Hitchcock keeps an injured James Stewart in his apartment and he slowly senses murder across the block, and thus the spying begins...No strong language, violence or gore. Nothing. Hitchcock was a master of cinema and Rear Window is one of the many examples of how he can entertain and delight so wonderfully with such basic tools.The apartment blocks and the courtyard, which are fundamentally the only sets in this film are clearly studio made, but it really doesn't matter. Hitchcock manages to create an atmosphere with his camera closely examining each apartment; different people... different story.This is old Hollywood at its finest; Rear Window is wickedly entertaining, wildly interesting and at times tense. It is very much the type of film that we do not make any more; Today we are more interesting in brutal violence, sex and drugs.Rear Window is a classic in every sense of the word and it shall stay as that. It's hard to say Hitchcock's finest, because the man had so many masterpieces it's difficult to say which is best, but a masterpiece nonetheless.9/10",9,0,1,28 October 2007

","The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King (2003)Note: This review both applies to the original 201 minutes cinematic version and the 251 minute Extended Cut. Well... It is an exhaustive experience, it isn't easy sitting without disruption through four hours of monsters, CGI beasts, prolonged battle sequences and a storyline that surpasses the length of all the stories of the Holy Bible. Don't get me wrong this is a beautifully made film, faithfully adapted from Tolkien's thick, detailed novels revolving around that precious ring. I watched both 201 minutes and 251 minute versions. If you are a fan of the film, I also recommend the longer version. 50 extra minutes of footage that you will be able to cherish and appreciate. It doesn't flaw the film it just boosts it.Still all the fantasy distilled from every corner of the mind and put into this blockbuster does not, somehow, doesn't justify a Best Picture Oscar for me; Mystic River was a finer film. Did I Like the Film? Does it matter? A box office gross in excess of $1.1 billion, what does it matter? A film with 11 Oscars and a heap of critics praising it... Well I don't think this film should be in the top 100, 50, 20 or 10 films. It just doesn't have that drive. Jackson's technical and directorial achievements deserve every single praise, the film's style, art direction, effects, cinematography deserve all the accolades, but this isn't a best picture.

There goes the idea.The story of Freddy Krueger, a maniac who killed 20-30 children on Elm Street and was not imprisoned due to a technicality, only to be burned to hell by angry parents... However Freddy doesn't go away that easily! He comes back and haunts teenagers of Elm Street in their dreams, and if he kills them in their dreams, that's it! Bam, they are dead and gone another kill from the man with the razor blades...Elm Street was made on an unbearably low budget ($1,800,000) and this is evident in a lot of the make-up, set design and special effects. However one should not see this as a negative. The film is fiendishly inventive, original and at times tense and disturbing. A Nightmare on Elm Street is part of a number of horror films that are actually good, effective and disturbing.

In my opinion a superb film. 6 years later Scorsese gathers his cinematic mastery to create another powerful and brutal period gangster drama about New York (of course).Gangs Of New York is a bloodthirsty film about the struggling, lawless period that was endured while America was being 'born'. Immigrants were registering in Ellis Island and thereafter were unleashed to prosper (or otherwise) in the land of the free.Scorsese shows us how the already established 'Americans' fiercely despised the Irish settlers. The film's opening scene is brutal, obscene. A bloody battle led by Liam Neeson for the Irish and a sociopath, prejudiced Daniel Day Lewis (who is astonishing) as Bill The Butcher wanting to clear the scum off of the streets of New York; his streets, his corners.This is a Martin Scorsese film so I don't need to tell you that a) it is violent and b) it is very good. Though it may not apply to everyone, Gangs is a beautifully crafted, directed and acted masterwork from one of the finest and purest directors of the past three decades.Watch Leonardo Di Caprio's risky journey as he befriends Bill The Butcher in a mission to ultimately avenge his father's death at the Five Points battle.'A stunning period gangster epic' 8/10",8,0,1,9 September 2007
Gladiator," A great epic...
","Gladiator (2000)Number 3 - 2000Not only is it filled with bloody and visually stunning battle sequences, but it has an emotional backing behind it. That is what makes Gladiator the film that it is. That is why it won Best Picture. It isn't just a meaningless 3 hour bloodbath, it is a breathtaking, epic film that has Russell Crowe avenging the Roman Empire for slaying his family.Russell Crowe is on top form, in an engaging, Oscar grabbing performance that echoed across the film industry.Ridley Scott's epic is a classic story of 'good versus evil', about justice and vengeance packaged in the form of magnificent entertainment.9/10",8,3,5,11 July 2007
Born on the Fourth of July," Stone's passionate, meaningful war epic with Cruise at his charismatic best
","Born on the 4th of July (1989)Top 3 - 1989 Oliver Stone, a great American director, whose films often reflect the flaws in the country he loves and admires so much, brings us his second Vietnam based film (after the triumphant success that was Platoon). The story of a young man, a patriot, willingly enrolling himself in the marines to go to fight the Communists in the aimless Vietnam War. Upon his arrival, Ron Kovic (Cruise) witnesses the horrors of wars. One day during combat he is shot in the back and paralysed, not being able to walk again. Upon his return in the United States, where he goes to a Veteran's hospital, a dirty, bleak place, underfunded by the government, where he learns that no one gives a sh*t about the war back in the US. Anyhow, the film tracks the story of Ron Kovic as he slowly becomes a fierce opposer of the war and joins other soldiers and civilians in the march against WAR. Stone's film is superbly directed (Oscar Winner Best Director) and powerfully acted by Tom Cruise, in what is in my opinion, his best performance by a mile and the closest he has ever come to winning an Academy Award. A respectable achievement and wonderful documentation of the horrific mistakes and coarse actions of governments and possibly 1989's Best film.8/10",8,1,4,6 February 2008
The Pursuit of Happyness," A powerful and ultimately wonderful film
","The Pursuit Of Happiness (2006) Top 5 -2006 If you see the performance of Will Smith in this film, you will truly understand the measure of talent that this man has. This is an outstanding performance by Smith, his best to date. Alongside his own young son (who by the way is surprising exceptional), Smith plays Chris Gardner, a man struggling with severe financial problems. His wife is not strong enough... she gives up, but he pursues alongside with his son for a better tomorrow, but they have to endure poverty and homelessness for success.The Pursuit of Happiness, finally becomes Happiness, but at the very end of the film as Chris walks with the masses and is finally able to smile, raising his hands and clapping in the air. The image freezes, the film ends and I, with everybody else in the cinema were pleased with the conclusion.The Pursuit of Happiness is a simple film. It is about the struggles of one family in the democratic land of the free. What raises this film above what could have been a strictly average film, are the emotionally charged performances, and the effective translation of power, love and relationships throughout the film. This film is as good as it can get. Simple, yet exceptionally powerful.8/10",8,0,0,19 November 2007
Back to the Future," Timeless...
","Back To The Future (1985)Top 3 - 1985One of the greatest sci-fi/action/adventure/fantasy/comedy films of all time. I have seen very few other films that have provided the sheer enjoyment that Back To the Future provides so effortlessly.The ultimate story: Using a time-machine, visiting famous times, seeing life when your parents were your age and causing so space-time continuum problems.Michael J Fox is superb as Marty McFly with equal if not greater praise to Christopher Lloyd for his fantastic interpretation of Dr. Emmett Brown, the mad scientist who made the De Lorean the car which is a time machine.With a little help from Eine!Verdict - An instant classic, bound to be loved for many, many years to come.8.5/10",8,2,4,8 June 2008
Goodfellas," Scorsese's panoramic examination of the mob. Goodfellas is nothing less than a masterpiece.
","Goodfellas (1990)Number 1 - 1990Top 3 - 1990s Top 30 - All Time Top 5 - Gangster Films of All Time Martin Scorsese's long and distant masterpiece about the mob, is a cinematic colossus, an account of Henry Hill's life and, told in narrative by Hill (who is played flawlessly by a young and eager Ray Liotta), who openly tells us that 'as far as I could remember I always wanted to be a gangster'... Scorsese shows us why: A young Henry, living in a small flat, with his mother and siblings and his Irish father who was angry at his low life job and often channelled his rage by beating Henry.Henry stares in awe, at the mafiosi across the street and their hedonistic lives with girls,fast cars, money and cops working for them. Hill gets a job across the street working for Pauli, and it all evolves from there...Scorsese is the right man for this film. The man who knows the material so well through his experiences of growing up in Little Italy; this allowed Marty to observe and perhaps wonder about such operations such as crime and the people behind it.Goodfellas is a Scorsese film for obvious reasons. The themes are evident all around; the troubled misguided leading characters, bonds of loyalty and betrayal, a strong element of Catholicism from the characters backgrounds and all the other themes that are incorporated into the film.The character study in Goodfellas is perhaps the deepest Scorsese has ever reached, it is a riveting study of the operations, feelings, thoughts and actions of the Wiseguys, focusing on Henry Hill. The world of the Mafia and the values it withholds are fascinating and at times complex, but the film goes in out, left and right to study every single aspect of these people's lives.Although I do prefer 'The Godfather' overall, Goodfellas is arguably better in many respects. It is a direct, unsavoury and often brutal display of the Mafia. Scorsese's film is a more modern gangster tale, where the industry has evolved into a more violent, more unglamorous and elaborate business from Coppola's mafia world.The glamour and power that may come from the mafia lifestyle is contrasted by Scorsese, with the bloodshed, cheating and paranoia that follow Henry Hill and those around him as the film progresses...It is indeed the truth, that crime does not pay...This film is another example of how Martin Scorsese films bring out the best in every actor, push everything a step further. Look at Robert De Niro in 'Taxi Driver', 'Raging Bull', 'The King of Comedy'. Ellen Burstyn in 'Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore', Daniel Day Lewis in Gangs of New York... Scorsese films are known for boosting actors to otherwise undiscovered levels...In this film, Liotta is strong and De Niro gives another masterclass, but it is perhaps Joe Pesci that outdoes himself with a calculated fleshy portrayal of Mafiosi Tommy De Vito, a man of outrageous violence...This is a masterful film, and possibly the best films of the 1990s.As Roger Ebert put it, Many of Scorsese's films have been poems about guilt. I leave it at that.10/10",10,0,1,14 October 2007
Jurassic Park," 'The definitive adventure film of all time'
","Steven Spielberg's 'Jurassic Park' smashed box office records upon release and became the highest grossing film at the time...The film is a technical triumph...A great blockbuster, that is not mindless, that does not bore you with loud bangs and explosions every seconds...This is Spielberg proving his rightful title as the 'King of the Blockbuster'.Jurassic Park is a fine example of Spielberg's imagination and creativity. Mysterious locations, shady characters, fierce dinosaurs and a futuristic theme park. Michael Crichton's novel turned into a truly great film.Richard Attenborough has managed to clone dinosaurs safely and put in them in a gigantic theme park where visitors can come and enjoy the prehistoric animals. But nature finds a way and the dinosaurs escape ...9/10",9,4,5,12 August 2006
The Simpsons Movie," Homer's Odyssey...
","The Simpsons Movie (2007)Finally, the long awaited movie version of one of television's greatest ever television shows arrives on the big screen. Is it a disappointment? No. Is it amazing? No.I have for a few years now enjoyed the clever, satiric, parodic and slapstick humour of the Simpsons and it is of course one of my favourite television shows. For a fifth of a century the town of Springfield has been the centre of comedy where the Simpson family causes havoc (mostly through the ironically named Homer) and live their lives.The possible story lines for the movie were endless. I heard that an obscene amount of drafts were rejected until the final one was approved.After worrying pollution levels in Springfield, action is taken, however Homer (along with his spider pig) manage to re-contaminate the whole town with horrific consequences. The EPA (environmental protection agency) puts a glass dome over Springfield cutting it off from the rest of the world. All because of Homer. The film follows the adventures of the family trying to save their town and gain the trust of their people once more.A funny, enjoyable journey of 90 minutes of cinema, but never exceptional or hilarious. The Simpsons Movie is solid but nothing more.7/10",7,1,2,19 July 2008
Atonement," A powerful, stunningly directed and ultimately harrowing film.
","Atonement (2007)Top 10 - 2007 Atonement has garnered considerable critical acclaim: 7 Academy Award nominations, 14 BAFTA nominations and won the Best Picture (Drama) at this years Golden Globes. The film will go on to win a number of accolades, some fully deserved, however, this is not the Best Picture of the year. Although this film had unlimited potential and it is beautifully translated onto the screen, I do not believe it extracted all the power and destructiveness of the love relationship present. Somehow at the end, I did not feel as sorry, as hurt and as saddened with the characters' ultimate fate as I could have been. However, heavily criticising this film, which is a remarkable achievement in storytelling, direction, editing, cinematography and even acting is highly unfair. During the course of a few summer days at a mansion in the plush countryside of England, a tragic event occurs that causes irrevocable damage to the gardener of the estate (James McAvoy) and one of the daughters of the wealthy family who has fallen in love with him (Keira Knightley). After the rape of one of the little cousins during one night, Cecilia's little sister claims that it was Robbie (McAvoy) who had raped her cousins; her decisions having been fuelled by a coarse letter that Robbie accidentally sent to Cecilia and seeing her sister having sex with Robbie in the library. Of course it wasn't Robbie who raped Cecilia's little cousin, it was in fact her brother's wealthy friend (an owner of a chocolate factory). This event unsettles everything, when Robbie is sent to prison and later given the choice of entering the army to fight in France (at the beginning of WWII) and so the ultimately tragic course of the film begins.Atonement is not a bad film. It deserves all its nominations and almost all its praise. However this beautiful, semi-melodramatic film is not this year's best film; not in a year with the Coens' 'No Country for Old Men' and Paul Thomas Anderson's 'There Will Be Blood'.This film could have potentially been unsurpassed by any film this year, however, in my opinion the character relationships were not magnetic and compelling enough and at times I thought the film wondered slightly just to fill the time, for the expected (but still) powerful ending. Some will undeniably feel more respect towards Joe Wright' fine film and some will definitely consider it this year's best film, all I have to say is that this is definitely a film that deserves to be watched, even if you are not fond of period epics, Atonement will not disappoint.7/10",7,5,7,5 February 2008
The Godfather," 'Perfection...'
","The Godfather (1972)Number 1 - 1972Number 1 - 1970sTop 5 - All TimeAn offer you can't refuse ...The Godfather is considered one of the greatest films of all time, perhaps the best. Marlon Brando's perfect portrayal of Mafia boss Don Vito Corleone is simply unforgettable and one of the finest performances everFrancis Ford Coppola adapts Mario Puzo's superb novel in a breathtaking fashion.Upon its release in 1972, many people knew that something special was expected - the result, one of, if not the greatest and superior film of all time. I won't sit here defending this colossal masterpiece, it needs no such thing. The Godfather is the definitive inside to the operations, bonds and thoughts of the Mafia. Only one other film manages to give us a breathtaking panorama of the Mafia and that is Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas'. Every gangster film is measured alogn the breadth of The Godfather:'The best gangster film since The Godfather'Coppola has created something so powerful, so unique that essentially cemented a whole new genre of film-making. This film did not follow stereotypes, arguably it created them. Breathtaking direction, incomparable acting, one of the best screenplays in the history of film amount to one of the most memorable achievements in film history.-10/10-",10,9,17,27 December 2005
