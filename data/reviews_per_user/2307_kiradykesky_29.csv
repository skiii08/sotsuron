The King's Speech," A seamless, impeccable movie
","All aspects of the film, from soundtracks to performances, are inextricably integrated. The overall quality of the film will not be weak if it confronts 'Social Network', and it will also show the style of the king. Colin's performance was the best of the year in my mind, none of it. He exquisitely and wonderfully interpreted this fierce and proud but lonely and fragile king. And this fight against self is also a battle that everyone should win in their lifetime.",10,0,0,23 March 2020
Black Swan," the beauty and the dead
","The only thought in this world is desire. It is beautiful, deadly, and lasting even for a short time. Its power can withstand thousands of holiness and unbearableness, destroy everything, and accomplish everything. The beautiful stage is decorated with applause and admiration, that is hell. Perfectionism is indeed a failed personality doctrine, which directly leads to madness. Portman acted so hard, and I saw my hair growling. If she took the little gold man with this film, it would not be an exaggeration.",9,0,0,21 March 2020

Requiem for a Dream," A lonely and desperate world
","Lonely and desperate, I can't imagine a life without TV chocolates. There is no light in the world or they are all extinguished by the darkness of despair. Addiction to desire is like being lured by the devil. Time and time again, standing on the verge of collapse. There is only one person left in the world, the dim speed of TV in front of a bed or sofa, and the pupils after hyperactivity shrink and expand, the world is so empty and psychedelic.",10,1,1,15 May 2020

","1. The slack plot setting shows that the director 's ability to control ca n't be underestimated; 2.

About Time," The most beautiful thing is love itself.
","'How long will I love you?' The plot takes a step back, leaving the stage for family and life, for the panic when missing a loved one, for the clumsiness of confession, for the last beach walk, the last hug, the last kiss . Twice a day, you will find the neglected beauty; the child raises three, in case some two who are too smart and stupid can be companions.

Doctor Strange," excellent
","For Marvel's work, this episode really takes a lot of work. The transformation, expression and remodeling of time and space are better than the Avengers series, incorporating many modern art concepts, and magnifying the visual spectacle in 'Dream of Space'. Slightly new. For Marvel's work, this episode really takes a lot of work. The transformation, expression and remodeling of time and space are better than the Avengers series, incorporating many modern art concepts, and magnifying the visual spectacle in 'Dream of Space'. Slightly new.The brain hole was wide open, the visual effects of space distortion and time cycle were all done well, and the funny bridge was quite in place.

Captain America: The First Avenger," the war and the movie
","Captain America has a humble trait that is lacking in many superheroes. Captain America deserves cheers for him. This is a man who wholeheartedly fights for the country and serves the people. This is an orthodox hero, and glad they take this role so seriously. It's not so much like a superhero movie as it is a war movie. In any case, the director did a good job.",9,0,0,20 March 2020
Silver Linings Playbook," Traditional comedy movie, recommended

Gone with the Wind," Forever classic
","The film presents a very unusual love story on the magnificent era picture, creating a love epic film with a real and vast historical background plus a fictional character story. The film retains the charm and depth of Margaret Mitchell's original works, with both colorful scenes and detailed portrayals of the fate of the characters. Whether you think of Shakespeare or vulgar soap opera, the film has achieved amazing artistic achievements. The heroine is not a 'good woman', but she has the toughness that many men may not have, as if nothing can defeat her. She can always find a fulcrum and stand up again, just as she always remembers in her 'Tomorrow is another' day '.",10,1,1,28 March 2020
Revolutionary Road," The performance is good and the characters are full. The mind that cannot communicate seems cold.
","You can't help but think, 10 years later, Jack and Rose live such a normal and ordinary life. The film is as bland as water, but reveals a sharp edge. The middle-aged little plum and the thin and late Winslet devoted two extreme quarrels. Watching the two scenes is simply not enough. The essence of the marriage was shocking. The two people constantly tortured and quarreled with each other, and all the warmth and feelings were exhausted. Finally, artificial abortion almost sentenced the marriage to death.",9,0,0,19 April 2020
Room," A light in the darkness
","You are my world in the room, and you will not be afraid to leave the room, because we are still together ... This sentence is said by the child, but it is also applicable to the mother.

The Lion King," Classic Film
","If 25 years ago, the animated movie was redefined by 'The Lion King', and 25 years later, it would have to redefine the filming. A movie without real animals, no actors, or even a camera, is completely reproduced with the most real movie shooting, and there is no compromise. Compared with the special effects of bombarding the look and feel, it even seems too low-key, which is exactly what it is most revolutionary. The 'Real Beast Edition' is destined to have less extreme formalism than the animated version, but the details and characters are handled more plumply, and the emotions that can bring to the audience are more sufficient.",8,0,1,2 April 2020
Coco," It's a classic cartoon, but it can't move me

Million Dollar Baby," True and cold, deep and moving.
","True and cold, deep and moving. The first half is a traditional sports inspirational film that makes people passionate and can't help but the second half turns sharply, bringing the film to a new level. A terrible ending, no flowers and glory, no loved ones and friends, and no justice at all, only lonely dead individuals. Usually, the story only tells the story of success. But most of the time from paralysis is life.",10,0,0,13 April 2020
Pride & Prejudice," The beauty of memory
","Darcy stammered and knew what to say in order to see that Elizabeth, who suddenly ran into the hut while she was in the hut, but she couldn't restrain her miss, and her eyes were too in place. The plot is good, but those misunderstandings are a bit unsustainable. The actor's acting skills cannot be said, and the scenes are beautiful.",9,1,1,18 March 2020
A Clockwork Orange," brilliant
","The film reveals the truth through a long and complete violence experiment: People's attitudes toward violence and the code of conduct inadvertently contradict themselves, both opposing violence and using violence to control violence. The humanity that Western society has always pursued is No longer exists, which makes the film give a feeling of misty and wildness, and the profound mocking of social politics and the collapse and confusion of people's life beliefs also express a deep spirit of exploration ~",7,0,0,9 May 2020

12 Years a Slave," The theme is profound and the narrative is general.
","Restraint, balance, consideration, and dignity meet the requirements of all classical aesthetics. This politically correct and sensitive genre can only be shot in this way. I really like a few scenes in a dark background. The light and shadow effect is very strong in the 'classical' style. It would be more interesting if the whole movie was filmed like this-but would it reduce the realistic skinny of 'adaptation of the real story'? ... this kind of film is the kind that has no complaint and no intention to repeat.",8,0,1,26 April 2020

La Vie En Rose," A beautiful and moving narrative
","The ups and downs, the waves, the scars, and the vicissitudes of her life, she has been injured, succeeded, angry, pained, and most importantly, she truly loved, at the end of life, but only accompanied by music and singing time The staggered editing techniques and too many supporting roles of the characters did not help the narrative of the story and the sublimation of the theme; but the exquisite interpretation of the heroine gave the film a rosy warmth and ended in tears.",8,0,0,17 March 2020
The Truman Show," Absurd drama contains truth.

Mad Max: Fury Road," Powerful women
","It is more and more felt that a woman often chooses to fight not for success, but to protect the people and things she loves and dignity. Maybe she looks ordinary when she settles down, but that is just because she is peaceful, it does not mean that she is unable to deal with this world. If she is really put in a difficult position, a woman who is determined to use her power may be stronger than a man. Because she can devote herself to ecstasy. Good drama, recommended!",9,0,2,11 April 2020
