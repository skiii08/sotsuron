Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," OK, People. Let's all calm down
","I was just looking at a number of the negative user reviews for Episode 1, and most of them find fault with really bad acting.With that in mind, I pose the following question to all of you.  With the possible exceptions of Harrison Ford and Alec Guiness, who 'DIDN'T' do terrible acting jobs in the first three films?  All three films from the original trilogy still rank very high among my favorite films of all time, but when I look back on them now, it's painfully obvious how whiny Mark Hamill's Luke is.  And let's talk about the woeful hyperbolic rantings of Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia.  Has anybody else ever wondered why Mark Hamill can't get arrested in Hollywood now?  Has anybody else wondered why Carrie Fisher became a writer?  BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T ACT!!!!!  But does that matter within the Star Wars context?  Of course not. So why should it matter that Jake Lloyd sounds pretty whiny himself?  One could argue 'Like Father, Like Son!'  Maybe Luke picked up a tendency to whine from his Dad!  And don't pick on Liam Neeson and Ewan MacGregor.  They're playing Jedi Knights, for God's sake!  They're not supposed to have personalities that jump off the screen.And quit picking on Jar-Jar.  Yes, he can be annoying, butC3-PO, R2-D2, Chewbacca, The Ewoks, and even Yoda had their truly annoying moments.  Heck, Yoda's still a crotchety old curmudgeon.I'm afraid people expected the same revelatory experience from Episode 1 that they received watching 'Star Wars.'  But let's face it--we live in a radically different world now, and films such as Episode 1 can't possibly have the same impact that 'Star Wars' did.  However, I will still look forward to owning this film, and the complete sextet, once it's available.(IF I WERE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT ANYTHING--IT'S THAT THEY'RE NOT AVAILABLE ON DVD.  THAT DEFINITELY BLOWS, NOT THE MOVIE)",Null,0,0,20 April 2000
U-571," Grow Up!
","For all those people from Great Britain blasting films such as `U-571' and `Saving Private Ryan,' I have two words for you-- GROW UP!  'Saving Private Ryan' and 'U-571' make no claim whatsoever to your comments that 'America won the war single-handedly.'  Give me a break!  'U-571' is clearly a fictional story based on an idea that was inspired by your countrymen's heroism in obtaining a real decoder.  'U-571' is simply a 'good yarn.'  As for 'Saving Private Ryan,' it is clearly an American Film that chose to look at ONE story among millions that all WWII veterans (American, British, French, German, Italian, Russian, Japanese, etc.) could share with us.  In your opinion, should Steven Spielberg be REQUIRED to choose a story with a British framework when he chooses to make a war-film?  Do you honestly think FOR EVEN A SECOND that by making this film, Spielberg intended to downplay all the pain, suffering, and sacrifice that Great Britain had to endure during this war?  If you do, then you're a fool.  And anybody (British or American) that walks into a film starring Hollywood's finest and expects complete historical accuracy needs to get their head examined.  And while I'm on that thought, perhaps you should contact David Lean or Sir Richard Attenborough, and ask them if any artistic license was taken when making 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'A Bridge Too Far,' respectively.
Perhaps you should be complaining to the British film industry about their lack of WWII films that focus on your countrymen's stories.  As far as I'm concerned, it's not Hollywood's responsibility to release films that tell the truth, whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  In fact, it's not even the British film industry's responsibility to do so.  If you want historical accuracy, READ A BOOK OR WATCH A DOCUMENTARY!  DUH!",Null,1,3,27 April 2000
The Exorcist," Brief Comments on the New Version
","I just had a few brief comments on the 'New Version', which I saw this past weekend.  I won't say too much about the film in general, because the public consensus on 'the Film' speaks for itself.The addition of the medical examination and 'spider-walk' scenes were a definite plus.  The first actually made the story more coherent, while the second was just damned cool!The additional dialogue between Father Merrin and Father Karras was okay, but it wasn't necessary.The new ending is c**p.  The original ending was perfect for the original movie, and would be perfect for the new version. Some of the additional subliminal shots of the demonic face were quite effective, but most of these extra touches just seemed gimmicky.The new sound mix.  Wow!  One or two speakers does not do this movie justice.  The DVD, 5.1 digital mix is great.  But the new mix for this theatrical release is perfect!So that's what I think.  Of course, they could've re-released the original version in theaters, and I would still have seen it.  This movie must be experienced in a theater at least once!",Null,0,1,25 September 2000
Dirty Dancing," All of You are Just Sick!!!!!
","I just read a number of user reviews, and all I have to say is that 'You're all sick!!!'  This lamebrained, terribly scripted, terribly constructed, terribly acted movie is your 'Favorite Movie of All Time?'This is the movie that made me avoid 'Ghost' for over a year (definitely a mistake), because after seeing this, I incorrectly assumed that anything with Patrick Swayze in it was just going to be BAD.The story's been told before (repeatedly, I might add).  Even if the story hadn't been told before, every aspect of the movie is completely predictable.  Most of the dialogue is more laughable than most spoofs of 'Star Trek' (at least when those people are spoofing Shatner as Kirk, they're 'trying' to be funny).  And the acting--ugh, even if the dialogue wasn't so bad, most of the principals are so wooden you could use them as surfboards.The dancing scenes--okay, they were pretty good.  But unless you're Kelly, Astaire, or Rogers, dance scenes do not a good movie make.I can see people being entertained by this movie.  I really can (just not me).  But to call it your favorite movie of all time? AAAARRRRGGGHHHH!",1,29,83,9 December 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Let's Get This Straight
","For those people who feel 'Saving Private Ryan' was nothing but an excuse to put some gratuitous violence on screen, or feel that the violence was 'over the top,' I have just three words for you--Read Your History.  Read Stephen Ambrose's book on D-Day (Ambrose just happened to be the historical consultant for the film), and you will learn exactly what bullets, mortars, grenades, etc. actually do to a human being. You'll discover that the violence that television and other movies have fed us for the last 20-30 years is a bunch of c**p.And for those people who have been involved in war, then watch this film and claim that the violence is excessive and false, then obviously, your experiences in wartime didn't mirror those men who's accounts were used in the book mentioned above and in 'Ryan.' And they don't mirror those memories of countless men who saw this film and left the theater visibly shaken, because their story was finally told the way it should be.Steven Spielberg was not trying to 'Out-Gross' 'Braveheart.'  He was attempting to open our eyes.  And if he was successful, then maybe those truly gut-wrenching scenes would serve a noble purpose--if not 'An end to war,' then at least an end to the Romanticism of War.  Which is, at least, a step in the right direction.So 'Shakespeare In Love' received the Oscar.  Is it ever going to be referred to as ' A National Monument?'  I doubt it.  'Saving Private Ryan' is still getting coverage that refers to it in those terms.So, to sum up, before criticizing this movie based on its level of violence, try accumulating a little background before making such accusations.",10,1,2,8 November 1999
Toy Story 2," Wow!
","I'm not going to say much.  Don't need to.I have read nearly a hundred professional and user reviews of this movie, and every single one of them was ecstatic about it.  I can also honestly say that although this year has had a tremendous share of quality films, this ranks up there with all of them, perhaps surpassing all of them.  It definitely was the most fun I've had at the movies this year.John Lasseter deserves something for his work.  He's directed all three of Pixar's feature films, and all three have been brilliant.  I, for one, can't wait for his next film.  But until then, I'm guess I'll have to console myself by seeing this one a few dozen more times!  Because it's worth it!!!![Note: For anyone who didn't like this movie, you had better check your pulse.  You're probably beyond dead.  And as you can see by the praise showered on this film, most people would agree with me.]",10,0,1,2 December 1999
The Green Mile," A Wonderful Film, Critics be Darned
","I found this film to be powerful, heart-wrenching, and simply everything I expected.  I have read the complete book (twice), and this film exceeded my expectations.  I didn't think it would generate such an emotional response after getting emotional while reading the book, but it did.  And it did for most of the people in the theater; I heard sniffling and the ruffle of tissues all over the room.  During both of my viewings.As for the movie's length, and the flak it's getting as a result, all I can say is that if the people who are complaining about the length of the film actually read the book, they'd understand that everything in the film was necessary to drive the story.  What's the problem with our world today? Have we reached the point where people lack the attention spans to not only shun literature, but also disapprove of films that are longer than two hours?This film tells a wonderful story.  The story development flows almost perfectly.  It has the perfect blend of humor and drama.  Everybody in the cast (and I mean everybody) did a superb job (Michael Clarke Duncan IS John Coffey, swear to God), and knowing exactly how everything would turn out did nothing to turn me away from being captivated by the whole film experience. If I had to find fault with something, it would have to be the ending, which seemed to be 'slapped together' to tie things up (Of course, the ending of the book had the same feel, as well).  So I give it a 9/10.  Go see it!",9,0,0,13 December 1999
