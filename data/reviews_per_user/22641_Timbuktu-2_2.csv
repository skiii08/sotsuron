Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An absolutely excellent surprise!
","I would not call myself a Star Wars fan.  I still don't consider myself one. Actually, when The Phantom Menace came out I could have cared less.  Then I was at my friend's house and we decided to go see it for the hell of it. And then I was blown away.  After reading how 'terrible' this movie is I was sure I was in for a disappointment but man, was I in for a surprise.  As soon as the yellow text appeared on the starry- skied background, I knew I would love this film.  Not only are the special effects phenomenal; especially in the pod racing scene and the Gungan underwater village; but the plot was great.  It was what it was made to, set the stage.  I loved this movie and do not want to give too much away but I must say that I do not think justice has been served to the incredible Natalie Portman.  She is beautiful, intriguing, and a silence falls over the audience when the speaks.  I hope she is given more screen time in II and III and believe me, I will be first in line.",9,0,0,27 June 1999
Armageddon," And this was the highest grossing movie of 1998?
","After I walked out of the theater, I was seriously going to go up to the cashier and get a refund.  Armageddon was that bad. Ok so an asteroid the size of Texas (get real? And they never saw it coming until it was 18 days away?) is coming to Earth and going to kill everyone.   So what does NASA do? They send half a dozen idiotic, egotistical oil drilling maniacs to save the world.  With NO backup plan, NO creative thinking and NO story.  The only story was of course Liv Tylers and Ben Affleck's little love, but oh kazoo.....While the team is in space they give Liv her own little room with 15 TVs to weep over and man this movie sucked hard. Ok so the special affects were good but man I wanted to go have my ears checked after I saw this movie...it was SO LOUD!!!!! I ended up stuffing tissues in my ears it was that loud.  So if you haven't seen Armageddon..DON'T...see Deep Impact instead.",1,3,5,23 January 1999
