The New World," Awful!!!
","A few more polite adjectives that leap to the forefront if you are unfortunate to be trapped in the same room with this horrendously pretentious chick-flick include:<ul><li>Badly Acted, Badly Cast, Revisionist, Maudlin, Boring, Long Winded, Pedophilic, Condescending, Arrogant, and Insulting.</li></ul>Not only is this piece of balderdash insulting to those brave and hardy souls who first explored the New World, it historically inaccurate, and it reeks of massive overdoses of political correctness. The forest dwelling primitives who greeted the Europeans are no longer 'Indians', (red or otherwise), they are no longer 'Natives', nor are they 'Aboriginals', - they are 'Naturals'. What comes next? - 'Ethereals'?The mind-numbing pseudo-intellectual sycophants that rave over this filmic film-flammery leave me wondering what has happened to our society's overall IQ level.",Null,2,4,24 May 2006
