Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It sucked.
","I cannot believe all the hoopla this film has gotten.  I really liked the original Star Wars because it was fresh and the graphics were new.  This movie is nothing more than the same stuff I've been seeing on computer games for the past 5 years or so.  Frankly, I got tired of all the computer graphics in the first 1/2 hour of the movie and was waiting for some real acting to begin.I was really disappointed with the lame writing and acting in this movie. The actors involved are capable of so much more.  The only reason to sit through this farce is Natalie Portman.  She carried the entire movie and I predict she will become a major leading lady in years to come.The storyline is long, drawn-out, hard to follow and down right boring. All in all, I'd say spend your money on something worth seeing like 'Entrapment' or 'The Matrix'.",Null,1,2,25 May 1999
