It," Great movie
",I just love this movie.This movie is chilling but fun to watch.The plot of the movie is exactly like the last 'it'. Nothing has changed which I love. Also the modern part of the film makes 'it' fun to watch. I recommend this movie to everyone. Expect kids younger than 10.So at last this movie has a great plot line and is really fun to watch.,10,2,3,9 October 2017
