Blade Runner 2049," Replica movie about replicants.
","The original Blade Runner movie was slow moving, a bit clunky in parts and the acting was wooden. But then again that is what we expect of replicants. The set design and special effects were stupendous. Attention to detail right in the original Deckard flat which used designs from Frank Lloyd Wright were appreciated by many. Of all the story elements in the first movie the one that didn't make much sense was the romantic one. Sure Deckard made a connection with the replicant Rachel but by modern standards his encounter looks more like a rape than a romance.Fast forward to the 2017 version. The new team have successfully captured the tone and the look of the previous film. They even got a musician who can match the style although I kept looking around for a train or some other traffic at various times due to the extra 'horn' sounds. Not sure what they were but they didn't add anything to the film. I believe it was something called a Shepard tone which is an unneeded gimmick.Tyrell is gone and replaced with some weirdo called Wallace who appears to be blind. He appeared to kill a new 'replicant' for no reason other than to look creepy. His sidekick is a kind of anti-Rachel replicant who has her own mission. I don't think we even learned her name which is a bit disturbing if anyone was hoping that a strong female part meant something. Apparently her name is Luv which must be ironic.What is less ironic is that the very core of the movie hints at something only a woman can do but for the whole movie we see events from the 'male gaze' and none of the women are treated as anything more than slaves. The politics of the replicants and humans is part of the narrative but there is no self awareness here at all.K the blade runner who is the central character appears to be having some kind of identity crisis but since he doesn't feel pain it is hard to tell. I was confused as to why a replicant has a holographic girlfriend but maybe that is part of the general confusion over identity. However it is problematic that so far the only human we get any airtime with is a police woman who does make a grand speech about the significant of a particular plot element. That speech is more coherent than most of the talk in the film. I understand the use of a MacGuffin. I'm not sure it is necessary to have the MacGuffin get so much screen time but it is the Deckard character. The whole wander around a deserted casino seems like it was cribbed straight from another '80's movie called Cherry 2000 which featured similar subject matter. Apparently this is what happens to Las Vegas and the giant statues of women that we see toppled over leads one to think for a moment that perhaps they worshipped women in some kind of long gone world. The film makers could have done something with that but it is clear that the statues were just props like women are in the rest of the film. After the baddies find Deckard and K the plot lines get thoroughly scrambled. It might also be because that would have been about 2.5hrs into the story. There is an attempt to wrap up some loose ends but in my opinion by then I'd had enough. There is an action sequence near the end featuring 3 replicants with no real emotional heft which adds to the confusion. It felt like an attempt to rescue the story. Ironically Roy in the first Blade Runner movie was much easier to make some kind of emotional connection with. Sure he was extreme but he wanted to live and he offered up a range of emotions.The characters K, Deckard, Luv and Wallace were hard to identify with. Maybe that is the price of mistaking an idea for an actual living thing. It very much seems to me that what we have is a replica of a movie. Something that could have happened in a holo deck but hard to take seriously otherwise.I really wanted to like it and perhaps if one was to edit out 30 or so minutes it would be much better.",6,17,38,5 October 2017
The New World," Nothing that an editor, a new script and new sound engineer couldn't fix!
","Really wanted to like this but it quite simply made no connection with the audience for most of the time. In fact after the first 30 minutes it stopped even trying to make a connection.If I was the editor I would have cut over half the movie run time as it added nothing. Much has been made of the voice-over style used rather than actual dialogue between the characters. This is a key problem because you have to actually hear it and want to know what they are saying and truth is I couldn't hear half of due to the unusually bad sound quality.Captain Smith had 1 expression (pretty much) all tilted eywbrows and 'why am I in this movie?' kind of look. In fact most of the characters looks somewhat bemused and probably surprised they could get paid for being in such an incoherent film.Perhaps the sound/ music department also got bored with the film and walked out? Seems to me that any technique should be used to add value to the experience, to enhance and inspire, sadly it just doesn't happen here.",1,0,5,16 July 2006
Inglourious Basterds," Not good enough to be satire, not bad enough to be good
",The film seems to have a couple of false starts complete with chapter headings. When we meet the the basterds they come straight out of cartoon territory. One even has a baseball bat which he uses to kill Nazi's. Which much to my amazement he does.Clearly there is some kind of bad joke stunt being set up but it is not clever enough to be satire. Brad Pitt is pretending to be a bad actor but not quite bad enough to be entertaining. He is ponderous and stupid in every scene.Just when you think it can't get more ridiculous there is a fantasy music sequence with the song from 1982's Cat People movie complete with close up's on the actresses green eyes. An obviously out of period song was there for what reason?None of the characters are more than sketches. Maybe the point is that war is some kind of absurdist nightmare but surely there was a better way to do all of this.,1,16,28,31 December 2015
Suicide Squad," Soundtrack was the best thing about this
",This very much seemed like a whole movie worth of background filler setting up the back story for a real movie sometime later on. Like an endless trailer. The very best thing about it was the soundtrack. Just imagine the sound of music on fast forward with better music but only props instead of actors and that would describe most of it.There is a bizarre subplot involving the Joker which should have been left out as it just made the movie longer and it is already the longest trailer in history.The character of Amanda Waller is so bad she makes the other characters look positively heroic. And yes I was surprised when she popped up at the end of the film showing us that the whole thing was just a trailer for another film.The only reason I am giving this a 3 instead of a 2 is the soundtrack and Will Smith. That man can make pure corn dialogue sound meaningful and he is the only actor who surpassed the limitations of the writing. For an example of this genre that raises the bar go see Deadpool. Somehow that film transforms its comic book universe into something that is entertaining. Suicide Squad does not.,3,1,3,3 September 2016
The Graduate," I liked the car
","This movie was very much a product of its times. Watching this movie 47 years after it was made is a curious experiment. I totally get why some think its a very significant film and captures the zeitgeist of 1967 and for viewers who are older and remember some of that perhaps it does.But if I may be so bold - looking at it now it is more of a curious relic where many of the elements that were significant in 1967 just look strange now.Dustin Hoffman may as well be a piece of wood throughout the whole movie. I'm not a fan of his acting and certainly his fame from this role has nothing to do with his acting skills since he really may as well have been asleep through the first half.As others have remarked the second half of the film is inexplicable and doesn't really make much sense.If the Ben character was sleep walking through the first half then having him wake up and decide to go stalk the daughter in part two of the movie might be progress but it shows he has learned nothing.In fact the character of Benjamin is perplexing all round. Surely if he has completed a 4 year degree at an Eastern university he would have some clues, some friends and some ambition but that is not in the script. Instead he is little better than a prop for his parents expectations. In 2014 if we see a character like that we would call him a loser and that is what he is.Sure there are some other elements about the film which are worth a mention and many others have remarked on this. The soundtrack, the cinematography and editing is all savvy and well done. However I think the reason why this film still resonates for many- especially older viewers is the subject matter and the exploration of what would have been taboo topics in 1967.I did like the final scene where the characters are on the bus and they seem to realise something has happened but they have no idea what.For me in 2014 however I mostly just liked the car. A classic Alfa Romeo and the biggest dramatic moment was when it was driven on the curb and nearly crashed.For those reasons this film is a flawed classic. I'm glad so many people like this film but there are much better ways to tell stories now and I'm also very glad about that.",5,1,1,21 February 2015
Elysium," Visually beautiful to look at but flawed
",The movie looked much better than I expected. The set design and special effects were for the most part well executed. The main villain Kruger was unintentionally? funny. By the way he doesn't have a speech impediment that is a South African accent but it was definitely played up on the parody scale. What I liked about the movie is it seemed to be paying homage to the first terminator film in very many ways and that was a plus.It looks like in the end the team wanting to make it an action movie won out and I suspect that the fights etc. are better than average but I don't watch action movies and so I can't make that comparison. I find all of the shooting and grunting tedious and pointless would have liked the story to have more heft.There were a few moments when the film struggled to make a more emotional connection and I would have liked more of those.Jodie Foster really just has a cameo role that could have been played by any sleep walker. I imagine the script notes said 'act wooden' and that would have covered all of her scenes. As for the idea that they could simply reboot the space station (core code) and change the 'law' it is so simple anyone can understand that but at the same time it is profoundly stupid for anyone who knows about coding.Still if you like action movies this is worth seeing and for the bad guy (Kruger) hamming it up furiously he was so bad he was good.,7,3,5,22 August 2013
Inside Man," Too abstract to bother anyone
",There is a clever story in this film but it takes so long to be revealed it becomes an anticlimax. A bank president has done bad things and keeps the evidence in a safety deposit box. There is an awful lot of planning going on to make it look like the equivalent of a postmodernist bank robbery. The problem is no one can connect with the hostages or the robbers because they are wearing masks over their faces most of the time. The police lead investigator thinks he is in a stand up competition looking for more comedy bits for next set.In a word the whole event is kind of anonymous with very little to connect to so when the story progresses we just don't care.,5,1,4,19 May 2018
The Wolf of Wall Street," Very Mixed Feelings about this film
","I believe the intention was to show that the real life character had learned from his over the top past and was now doing the right thing but from what I've seen of Jordan Belfort that is yet another con.Having said that the sheer scale of the excess is funny enough to sweep most viewers along in its wake. Who actually gets to trash a helicopter, yacht and a super luxury car in one film? So I have very mixed feelings about this. Yes there were lots of funny scenes but the denouement is very unsatisfactory. The 'wolf' gets a slap on the wrist with a wet bus ticket and promises to pay $110m to his victims.He also gets a promo for his real life business at the end of the film. It very much looks like he is selling the same questionable sales techniques to a new generation - many of whom will use those skills for harm rather than good.A telling moment in the film is when Fortune magazine writes an article about the Stratton Oakmont firm and says they are shysters. The Wolf thinks this bad review will sink the firm but instead he is swamped by dozens of young staff who all want to work there.That moment - unfortunately seems to be what the film is about really. The firm are crooks but enough people are prepared to look the other way to continue the charade. Like the audiences for this film - we come with high expectations - this is Martin Scorsese but instead we get an actor driven film where Di Caprio wallows in the excess for laughs.Granted he is a fine actor but at least I didn't pay to see this one. I had been given a free pass.I see in real life that Jordan hasn't been paying off his $110m and until he does better on that front I think he is just another con artist. Now though he has added all of those who watch the film to his tally of victims.Note: I have watched the real life Jordan on video and there is a striking resemblance to Bobby Cannavale. I wonder if having someone other than Di Caprio in the title role would have been less distracting.",6,4,8,4 February 2014
Inception," Unwatcheable
",Despite watching the first hour of the movie I was none the wiser. It just seemed to get more pointless as it wore on. I know it is about dreams but my dreams are way better than anything in this movie. Consequently I was unable to finish watching. I wasn't able to identify or empathise with any of the characters. There is a probably a script in there somewhere but in decades of watching films this is the first one I have given up on entirely. I doesn't help to have Leonardo DiCaprio and Michael Caine - neither of whom ever appear to do any acting. I was thinking that Aeon Flux is a movie that explores similar territory but looks great even if it is somewhat incoherent also.,1,3,4,21 March 2016
Amélie," sweet, funny and charming
",I liked Amelie because we get to fill in the gaps in the story and the dialogue is incidental really. The story works incredibly well on a visual level. This is a postcard Paris and everything has that unreal sense about it. Its almost as if too much talk will spoil the imagery. Thankfully this never happens. It is also good that some scenes are not explained like the sequence where Lucien is practising some insults (it seems.)Watch out for the gnome. This movie is also well paced and funny as well. I liked Delicatessan from the same team but disliked City of the Lost Children so Amelie was a sweet surprise.Even though this is a highly filtered view of Paris it is a fiction that was enjoyable at the time.,7,0,1,7 March 2002
Easy A," Satire and breakout role for Emma Stone
","When this movie came out the posters and advertising misrepresented it as another dumb teen flick. In fact it is a star vehicle for Emma Stone to gently mock and satirise high school life. I haven't seen Ferris Bueller's Day Off since it came out ( decades ago) but the one thing I remember about it was the lead character had confidence to spare. It is the same in this. Emma's character 'Olive' narrates to the camera and tells an improbable story. But she inhabits the role with just the right tone.As per usual what ruins Olive's reputation enhances the reputations of the misfit boys at the school. This is a very gentle poke at that double standard.I doubt that losing ones reputation (at high school) has been a big deal since the 70's but who knows what a strange place US high schools might be. So the key plot element which has 'Olive' supposedly losing her virginity and how that changes peoples perceptions of her is a bit of a stretch. However if you buy that contrarian idea then you are in for a treat. The best parts of the film are Emma Stone hamming it up for the camera - satirising the situation she finds herself in. There are some obvious film homage moments and a few somewhat distracting cameos from Stanley Tucci, Patricia Clarkson, Thomas Haden Church, Lisa Kudrow and Fred Armisen. That is not to say that Tucci, Clarkson, Kudrow and Armisen are bad but they are could have all been replaced by cardboard cutouts and the central story would have still worked out. Of the 'adults' Haden Church has the best lines.If you liked this you would probably like 'Freaks & Geeks' where lead character Lindsay Weir explores some of the same territory. Mainly this film film will be remembered for Emma Stone eating the carpet in almost every one of her scenes. One day if the 'Beyond Clueless' writers update their documentary 'Easy A' would be a worthy addition.",7,0,0,28 May 2016
Inside Llewyn Davis," A musical time bubble
","What I loved about this movie is how timeless all the songs felt. It looked like the songs were mostly live takes and a bit of research backs that up. Most of the songs also belonged to one person ( Dave van Ronk) which also added to the authenticity of the story. The most interesting part of the movie was the way in which the songs were presented as natural conversations of performances in context of a week in the life of the lead character.In future this movie will be remembered for the songs and that is fitting. When they were being performed time seemed to stand still. Even the song he performed for the Chicago club guy ( a bad choice of song - I think) was going somewhere.The other striking thing about the movie is the weird feeling of being out of sync with everything around it. Llewyn as the lead character see the future as flying cars and that contrasts greatly with his friends, his sister and other acquaintances. They mostly see him as an entertaining dinner guest ( the Goresteins) or a loser who has slept on their couches too many times. The real world flickers around him a few times and the possibility that he should go to Akron is raised. When he visits his father who has advanced dementia there is almost no recognition. But then Llewyn plays a favourite song of his Dad's.Just for a tiny moment we see something in his Dad's eyes and then it goes. The possibility of another life outside of a musical spiral on the breadline does seem to occur to Llewyn and he steps in that direction but never quite gets there.",7,0,0,30 March 2014
