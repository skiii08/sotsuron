Alien 3," not as good as Alien and Aliens but still good
","This movie ins't terrible, you guys are just too stuck up that it isn't as good as the others, its like when people get upset that Son of Kong isnt as good as King Kong, like judge it as its own move, also this movie isnt terribly dark like ebvertuone sayus, you guys probably havent watched youtube alone in the dark in your room after hissing at the lights on downstairs while eating spicy valentines day heart candies that were in the freezer for 2 days the day after valentines day, 6/10",6,0,0,16 February 2020
Alien: Resurrection," as good as Alien 3 but for different reasons
