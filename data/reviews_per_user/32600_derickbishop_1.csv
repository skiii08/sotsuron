Hereditary," Hereditary is a over-hyped disappointment.
","Before this movie came out it was maid out to be a movie similar to the exorcist and the conjuring. But it is more like the witch or the babadook.
For most of the movie it is a drama the deals with themes of sorrow and loss.
its not till the final act of the movie when it starts to fell like a real supernatural horror movie. And in my opinion the movie is not as scary as it is maid out to by yes is creepy but i was never really scared. The acting was amazing especially 
Toni Collette the cinematography was grate as well.",6,0,3,30 June 2018
