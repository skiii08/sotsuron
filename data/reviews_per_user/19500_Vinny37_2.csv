Source Code," Abusing the viewer
","The story has the interesting idea of someone able to plug into someone else's dying memory pattern, yet able to restructure their interaction with the event that had caused the other's death. Here, it's Colter Stevens who is plugged in, as attempts are made to locate who had planted the fatal bomb, in order to prevent the bomber from an even greater attack. Army Captain Stevens, thinking that he's in a simulation, is quite prepared to assault anyone in that simulation, but each time he fails, he learns a little more. He even learns that he is (I guess) at death's door - or perhaps as suggested in That Hideous Strength, his brain alone survived death. Whatever, I will never know, as at point 41.25 he yelled the f-word. In my books, at that point he assaulted me - I value marriage. So abused, I left the film with a nasty taste in my mouth. I'd give it zero rating if possible.",1,2,8,4 May 2016
Rudy," With a pinch, indomitable
","A delightful story of grit & determination against realistic odds, and a family friendly retelling at that. His family thinks that Rudy's dream is unrealistic and try to bring him back to earth. Put down as unfit for task, through boyhood and beyond, Rudy remains determined to become a winner in American football, prepared to take the knocks as he seeks to make it at a prestigious Roman Catholic university stateside. He can challenge and inspire us all: do we take the knocks and carve our name? It reminds me somewhat of another Rudy, viz Rudy-ard Kipling's If",8,0,0,14 May 2020
