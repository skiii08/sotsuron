The Lobster," Horrible Movie
","Dark, depressing, bad script, bad acing, weird, not funny at all. Don't waste your money on this POS. We walked out and got our money bad. That's how bad it was. I wish I could give it a zero. Today was my birthday and my girlfriend wanted me to pick out a movie to watch. We went thinking this would be a funny romantic comedy but it was nothing of the sort. Too bad. maybe if they did it differently it could have been. But oh well. I never walk out of movies even if they're bad I stay till the end but my girlfriend didn't want to sit through it. We gave it a chance. We probably stayed about 25 min. I don't get why it got such good reviews. just my opinion though so it's up to you.",1,30,50,20 June 2016
