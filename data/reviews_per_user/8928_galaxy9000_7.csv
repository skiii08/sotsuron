","SUCKER PUNCH is one of the best films i have every seen. This movie is a brilliant dramatically, action-fantasy genre mix movie with awesome music, very beautiful womens and a interested story.

The Hunger Games," Top Movie with a brilliant forward-anxiously Story
","This Movie goes to No. 2 of my favorites movies. After few shows in cinema i tell my opinion there:The beautiful Jennifer Lawrence and the other young stars doing an amazing performance. Im very impressed of the talent young actress and actors, that they playing the role VERY professional and emotional. This means also for the other older stars.The story is brilliant, a thinking will-be-future mordern future binding with old political elements. The movie combines dramatic and action with emotional and few romantic moments with a challenging story and very emotional music. It brings the people deep in the movie on the cinema screen. Not oversizes special effects show this very realistic and breathless.I give this title a 9 of 10. Only one star minus, because of to much camera shaking's in the scenes, that are to much i think. Also a few decisisions are foreseeable.Overall, the most people have the same opinion. A great start for this new trilogy. The movie is not for a special audience, its for all people. So a must see. I will go few more in the cinema to show that great title.The gross in the opening weekends going into records...",9,4,12,5 April 2012
Man of Steel," That was to much, only to much
","I give this movie only a 4 Stars for the actors, the background story of Clark, the beginning of the story of Luis and Clark and the special effects.The rest of the movie it was: To loud, my ears, and the of other visitors in cinema, after 140 minutes where 'ringing'. This was the loudest movie ever. To much!And the rest of the movie, especially the background and family story of Clark and later Luis, only War, Destroy, Destroy, Destroy, Fight, Destroy, Drump Music all the time and again Destroy, Destroy and Destroy with many SciFi-Special Effects.That was to much for a Zack and Deborah Snyder Movie. Im very sorry, that i must say that.But the offers in IMDb shows, that at the first weekend half of the budget of about was earned and after 2 weeks the costs are all earned. And the money worldwide, very impressive. So many people must like it. But the high costs are not more real for movies today, 200.000.000$ and more... Who can handle it today?! more...",4,2,6,24 June 2013
Divergent," A very good Movie with talented young-stars and great Story
","This movie is not a like from the Hunger Games. I love Divergent, so The Hunger Games Movies are now on my second place. For me is Divergent at the moment No. 1. A complete another Story and i think, this movie brings many more background-Story from the characters as in the Hunger Games. Shailene Woodley is a very talented, sympatic and beautiful Young-stars i like her seems the preview has started for many weeks in the cinemas and i watched Divergent more then 5-times in the Cinema. The Music is absolutely great, the Story very intensive, dramatic and many Actions Scenes. The Highlights are all Scenes with Shailene Woodley and Theo James, they playing fantastic. Im impressed that all the Young-stars doing. So and last, it seems that brings the Divergent Books good on the Screens, better then The Hunger Games, wow, what does it say: You must see it :)",9,0,1,1 May 2014
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," A great Other-Fairy-Tale Story with good stars, many funny moments, new ides, bloody fights and a background Story!
","After seeing this great movie a few times here in Cinemas in Munich, this movie is now one of my FAVORITES Movies in 2013!I'm very impressed, how it changed to his version of the good-old fairy-tale Hänsel&Gretel. And I'm very happy, that it was produced here in Germany too.This movie has lots of action, many funny moments, nice new ideas, good fight scenes and a good performance from the actor and actresses. The funny scenes and moments are very amusing in the audience in the cinema. Between then, there is a little background-story (yes, a story, u read it right!), and many bloody fights, that has also good and funny moments of that. I Think the balance is very well between Action, Story, Blood, the new Ideas and Fun.Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton are playing very good their role as Hänsel & Gretel, I'm very impressed.So, You should see the movie, to make a opinion yourself. Im going with lots of friends, their are also impressed about this 'Other-Fairy-Tale' Movie :)By the way, i like always 2D. I see it most in 3D in the Cinemas, but the 2D is better (my opinion).Thanks to the producers to make this movie and thank to the stars, who playing their role very great. BTW: Gemma is a very beautiful and great actress :)",9,0,2,11 March 2013
In Time," Great Movie, great story and great Actors/Actresses
","After a dozens of time that i see this great movie in the cinema in Munich (Kinopolis Mathaeser), this movie is one of the best, that i have every seen. Friends and family are the same opinion, that is movie is, short, awesome! The resonance of most of the audience people are great and the most time the full cinema rooms every day since about 3-4 Weeks, answer it itself.The storyline is great, sure little political, very thinkable about the world. The balance between action, dramatic, emotional, and special effects making this movie to a on-of-kind (my opinion).Amanda Seyfried (she is very beautiful in this movie), Justin Timberlake, Cillian, Olivia, Vincent and so on making a great performance in their roles in this movie. Justin is a great actor, Amanda is amazing, her wonderful eyes are hypnotically :) And the other stars are also very good in their roles. That was a very good Joice.People who has not seen this movie, go in the cinema and shot it. Make your own Opinion of it. For me, this is 9.5 of 10 Stars! Thanks to the story-writer, producers, and and and...Many regards from Germany Christian P.",10,1,6,14 December 2011
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Catching Fire: Amazing Movie, better then the first. Jennifer Lawrence in her Top Performance
","Since the Preview begins, i saw this few times in cinema. The second part of Hunger Games is much better then the first one. I loved the first part, but Catching Fire rock the first in all elements. Catching Fire brings: - More Emotions - More Dramatic - better political Background - the brutality of the System - the fight of the characters between them self and the others - more Scenes with Katniss Longbow talents Espasically Katniss fight between herself and the System are one of the best. Every Scene are amazing, Jennifers Performance is again Top, also of the co-stars. This movie are very near of the book. The Box office results and the visitors in Cinema speak for the movie. Im going one more time next days, because it is my top movie of the year. Looking Forward to the next parts :)",9,3,21,1 December 2013
