Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Great photography, beautiful period costumes & furniture
","When my husband suggested going to see this movie, I thought..'Not tonight!',but this movie got me right at the beginning. I absolutely loved this movie! I thought the casting was outstanding, the photography was amazing & the period costumes & furniture was beautiful. I am not always a Tim Burton fan,but he definitely got this one right. I am surprised at some of the negative reviews on this wonderful movie. This is absolutely not a kid's movie,but an entertaining vampire movie with some history thrown in. I was so glad to see a fresh face in Benjamin Walker playing Abraham Lincoln. He really aced the part & looked so much like Abe, it was daunting. My husband read the book & said the book & the movie only have a few similarities.",8,4,8,26 June 2012
Finding Neverland," Finding Neverland
","This is really a wonderful movie. I waited until this movie came out on DVD to see it & was pleasantly surprised how sweet & wonderful it is. Great casting,wonderful period clothing & sets-this movie should have won more at the Oscars. Johnny Depp was fantastic & continues to grow in his acting skills. All of the characters seem to suit their roles even to the smaller parts. I would watch this movie over several times since there is so many details to see. My husband thought this movie was wonderful,too & he loves action & war movies. I would recommend this movie to everyone. This is especially great for family viewing. We all know how hard it is to find a movie for all generations.",9,3,3,10 April 2005
Wind River," Nomination for Jeremy Renner
","After watching this great movie, I don't understand why Jeremy Renner was not nominated for an Oscar for this role. He really made the movie and you could see all of his feelings in his face. One of the better movies I have seen on Netflix this year.",9,0,1,11 March 2018
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Crazy,Stupid, Love Movie
","I wasn't sure if I wanted to see this movie at the theater,but I am really glad I did. The characters are well played out, not very likable at first, but after you get to know the cast, you really feel for everyone. I thought Julianne Moore & Steve Carrell had great chemistry with their relationship. Super script, nice directing, great casting with Robbie, the son. This movie will surprise you at how good it is. I loved how you saw the characters at work, at home, at the bar & with their friends. This was very well played out & comes together in the end extremely well. Ryan Gosling is very hot even when he is sleazy. Great date night movie!!",Null,44,71,6 August 2011
