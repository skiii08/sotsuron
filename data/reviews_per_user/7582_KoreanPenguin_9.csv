The Avengers," Joss Whedon is a human tank, like Thor.
","The Avengers was the first movie I saw in theaters three times, and for darn good reason. It sets the bar so high for comic book movies. DC is (was) seriously in a lot of trouble after The Avengers came out. If you have seen each of our hero's individual films, you will easily enjoy The Avengers ten times more. You will be also ten times more excited to see everything played out. I also feel like I need to say that I was very, very nervous when I heard The Avengers was announced. In film, we like to focus on one character, and we like to see that one person change over the course of the movie. It's hard to keep track of multiple characters, which is why the single-hero format works so well. Otherwise we end up with meathead city, like The Expendables. Gross. Luckily, we have The Avengers instead.So our unlikely heroes team up together to defeat Thor's brother, Loki. Luckily, all of these overpowered world savers are used to having each other as company, PSYCHNOTREALLY. They all have pretty big egos, let's be honest, but we don't see just how big their egos are until they all share one movie together. Jump ahead, they have to learn how to cope with one another, and just barely tolerate each other in order to stop the world-destroying threat.There is some absolutely wonderful cinematography, put together by Seamus McGarvey. Did I mention how clever the script is? Joss Whedon poured his fricking essence into the pages of writing, and it pays off so very nicely. I don't feel like The Avengers was missing anything that ticked me off. I also have never been so excited for a sequel before in my life. My only hope is that Disney can buy out Spiderman from Fox, and we can get some Spiderman action in there But I digress.The Avengers flat out rocked my socks off. 9/10.",9,6,11,19 December 2012
Oblivion," Oblivion
","Tom Cruise really isn't my favorite. Although he does do some things right from time to time.Welcome to Earth: 2077. I'm not spoiling much, because we find out Earth was ravaged by nuclear attack, leaving behind nothing but an unrecognizable, desolate wasteland. Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) works as a security repairman of sorts, living with Vika (Andrea Riseborough) his wife, girlfriend, roommate, I'm not really sure. Essentially, they are tasked with the duty of repairing and performing maintenance on defense drones within the safe radiation zone. These drones defend several giant rig machines that harvest water or something to help store fuel for the future of mankind, which has all apparently moved off to Saturn's moon, Titan.Besides the unsympathetic and hollow defense drones, Jack and Vika are alone on Earth, or are they? The nuclear holocaust took place because a species of alien attacked Earth, called scavengers (or scavs). Sally (Melissa Leo) guides Jack and Vika through a holo-device, directing them on how to go about protecting the rigs on a day to day basis. Sally supposedly lives on an orbiting space-cube of sorts, called the Tet. Therein lives most of humanity that hasn't already left for Titan.I'm sure you are already lost reading my synopsis, and rightfully so, as it's a maze of a plot. Being a science fiction film, the maze only develops more twists and turns as we progress, until everything that we once knew as fact is no longer such.I haven't seen director Joseph Kosinski's 'Tron: Legacy' so I'm not exactly sure if he intentionally likes to provide social commentary in his films without resolution on purpose. It's hard to not give away much by saying so, but there is a certain level of subtle (or maybe blatant) discussion here about our environment, and the rate at which the filmmakers believe we are destroying it. At another point, we are in a pristine, well-kept futuristic building, where Jack stands, covered in soot and dirt, a man who used to believe lies, now knowing the truth. A clean, spotless woman stands before him. The juxtaposition is clear, but at some point we are left wondering what it means. And it's not a moment where we actually want to know what it means either.The casting of Morgan Freeman as Beech seems to have been a wasted opportunity. Freeman doesn't have hardly any screen time, and the film's trailer gives him much more credit than is due; can I legally say such a thing about Morgan Freeman?Also, despite a few somewhat painful monologues with Jack raging about some ancient football game, or some classic literature, Cruise is truly in great form here.The highlight of 'Oblivion' is in the soundtrack. If you are at all familiar with the electronic band M83, then 'Oblivion' is sure to be a treat. The recurring theme from the film follows the aptly titled single, 'Oblivion'.'Oblivion' is a fun science fiction thriller, with plenty of excitement and a fantastic soundtrack. Hollywood is falling deeply in love with post-apocalyptia these days, and being fan of it myself, I can't complain.",7,2,4,17 September 2013
Wreck-It Ralph," Wrecking my little heart.
","As a gamer, I was completely taken by surprise at how much this movie captivated me. I was blessed as a child to be homeschooled, and through that, I experimented with games from essentially every genre and system. Luckily, I was able to play ancient titles, like Qbert and the ORIGINAL Donkey Kong. There are so many fun references and sound effects relating to old games from eons past, but at the same time, Wreck-It Ralph manages to captivate non-gamer audiences as well!Wreck-It Ralph is about a villain from an arcade game called Fix-It Felix. Ralph goes through and messes up a building, and Felix comes in to fix up the building, whilst Ralph is dropping crap on Felix, a la classic Donkey Kong. Eventually, Ralph just wants to fit in, seeing as he is always the bad guy, and THUS begins our hero-villain's journey.I love the concept of Wreck-It Ralph, and the execution is flawless. It's a wonderfully animated film, and you grow attached to character's very quickly. I've never seen John C. Reilly as someone that I could grow attached to, but he proved me wrong with this one Same for Sarah Silverman Or Jane Lynch Heck, they were all great. I should also mention that there were points in Wreck-It Ralph where I felt like the filmmakers were pulling my heart from my body, and then proceeded to step all over it, spitting on it, and crushing it. Absolutely heart- wrenching. I was torn up during Wreck-It Ralph. If you have a weak heart, you might perish while watching it. Also, a GREAT family movie. Just go see it.Wreck-It Ralph fixes my hope for John C. Reilly, and gets an 8/10.",8,6,8,19 December 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The Lord of the Hobbits
","Having seen the original Lord of the Rings trilogy too many times to count, I had certain expectations for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Fortunately, many of those inner-most needs I possessed were met, however, there will still a few stumbling points within the movie itself.We will start with the good, nay, the amazing! Peter Jackson follows through on his commitment to honoring Tolkien's years of work as a successful writer. There are so many absolutely beautiful scenes in this movie. Whether it's a helicopter pan of our team making their way across the deserted, fantastic landscape of Middle-Earth, or a slow zoom-in to the delicate, yet wonderful Last Homely Home of Rivendell.I wasn't in love with Gollum in the original trilogy, but I was completely in-tune and fascinated with the riddles in the dark scene. I saw Gollum in new light, where his desperation hadn't fully kicked-in yet (albeit, on it's way within a few decades though I'm sure.)As mentioned earlier, I was once in love with a woman named Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy, as well as the same tales written by Tolkien himself in his six book series of the same name, so absolutely any inclusion of foreshadowing of the events of the Third Age to come, such as the existence of Sauron, as well as the Witch-king of Angmar sufficiently squelched my need, by feeding it, and then giving me even more juicy details through conversations between 'former baddies' such as Saruman, having a somewhat critical, yet joy-filled conversation with the Lady Galadriel, featuring 'former woman' from Cloud Atlas, Sir Hugo Weaving, reprising his role as Elrond.Howard Shore again heads up the department with music, and does so to amazing effect, incorporating themes and motives from the Lord of the Rings, while making this soundtrack quite distinct, as you will see. You may feel a creep of goosebump-infected nostalgia roll over yourself as you hear some of them.Now the bad, unfortunately. Or maybe not bad, but a little bit of a downer.There were added pieces to this story that were entirely unfamiliar to Hobbit-aficionados, which works to an extent, but at some point, the warg chases grow to be somewhat repetitive. In the same way I tired of the non-stop, fabricated ringwraith chases in Fellowship. Also the inclusion of, said 'one-armed orc king'. Or, the inclusion of, said 'fat-chinned, massively over-disgusting goblin leader/king/whatever'.The funny bit is, fans who are unfamiliar to the children's book will not notice these additions, and probably won't care. For those of us who are attached to page-by-page description, it might matter some, or become a deal breaker for others.I should have added this into the pluses, but there is not a single character who was miscast in their role, neither were there any flat performances by any of our heroes, or villains, for that matter. I was, however, trying to distinguish dwarfs throughout the movie, and by the end, multiple dwarfs just looked to me as the same person. Lord of the Rings at least had different races of Middle-Earth denizens, that it worked, but here not so much. Which pains me to say, but 12 characters of the same, yet unfamiliar race make things hard for the audience in my opinion.Finally, the 3D. I was blessed to view this film also at 48fps, which was quite wonderful, and I think works for Jackson, maybe not only to an extent, but fully. 3D has come off to me only as a gimmick, added to movies just for the effect, but since this was no cheap conversion of an already decent film, the 3D really works here. It's a little unsettling having arrows flying at your face, or a butterfly teetering it's way from one side of the screen to the other. The action and fight scenes were completely astounding, with so many humorous moments, yet so many very exciting ones as well. However, in 3D, I was sometimes lost in the action, which was a little disorienting, but a quick recovery will follow, nonetheless.There were some very cheesy moments, like slinging dishes to the beat, but I think this is due in part to the Hobbit being a one book children's book... But this is inherently, one of the movie's few problems... It's not a six book epic. If anything, the Lord of the Rings should have been extended to something longer than a trilogy. For this Hobbit trilogy, a three movie spread will be very difficult without adding a lot of new material to Tolkien's work, and while it may be fantastic and loved by many, there will be some of us who grow tired of it. Additionally, outside of a two film spread, I don't see why we need three movies to tell an already short tale. MAKE THIS CLEAR, I loved The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, I loved practically every minute of it, but I also have a hope deep down within me that this will repeat the same pattern of the original trilogy. Fellowship was filled with exposition, where The Two Towers capitalized on the exposition, and filled in an absolutely breathtaking three hours to set up the majesty and wonder that is The Return of the King, which is one of my favorite films of all time. May we pray that Jackson's Hobbit trilogy follows suit and amazes us in that very same way. Jackson hasn't let us down yet in Middle-Earth, so I don't fully expect him to now.So quickly, fly on eagles wings, and cast a spell of amazement and bewilderment over yourself as you sit down for this nearly three-hour long spectacle. Hope you like motion sickness. But be very happy that this time, 3D is promised to not be a gimmick. I guarantee you will at least like, if not love, every minute you are in the theater.",8,3,10,22 December 2012
Elysium," This is Not District 9, but it sure is Fun
","Since my first viewing of 'District 9' from 2009, I have anxiously awaited director Neill Blomkamp's science fiction follow-up. 'Elysium' was announced at some point last year or so, and I was practically leaping for joy with anticipation. As the release date grew ever closer, more information came pouring out on 'Elysium' and it soon became evident that this was indeed not a sequel to the very successful 'District 9″. Let me assure you now that if you expect this to be any kind of successor to 'District 9″, you will be disappointed.That being said, 'Elysium' is not a terrible movie by any means. It stars not only Matt Damon and Jodie Foster, but also the lead role from 'District 9″, Sharlto Copley.In this dystopian tale however, we are dropped into a very gritty post-apocalyptia, as most futuristic visions are and should be. It's a brutal life for those left on earth. Overpopulation and disease has spread rampantly, leaving many living in favelas, or at least we can only assume. We don't see much of earth outside of the village of sorts that Max (Matt Damon) lives in. As our poor as dirt (literally) humans scrap for food and work, there does indeed exist a space station hovering in space called Elysium. This of course is where the wealthy live. A huge plus to inhabiting Elysium is the ability to lay down in an updated version of a tanning bed, and with an ID printed on your wrist, you can instantly become healed of injury, anything from diabetes to having half your head blown off. I think it's a nifty invention, and so do those on earth who pack together on a space shuttle and attempt to crash-land on Elysium to get a chance at a new life.The two societies clash with the wealthy employing absolutely brutal robot police on earth, ready to strike down anyone who does not comply with their orders. Max is a lowly factory worker who runs his mouth a bit much. Within time, his arm is broke, and while I won't spoil too much more here, suffice to say it becomes necessary for him to visit Elysium. This isn't much more information than you are given by the film's trailers of course.Alice Braga plays Max's love interest, and we are told they actually used to be quite close as children through flash backs. Apparently Max used to be catholic or something, and now he's an exceptionally hardened man, dependent on survival, no matter the cost.Damon is quite good here, and seems to pull off a bald head quite well. While we may not be completely in the know on why he acts the way he does, we are convinced that he is determined to finish his goals. Foster plays a very android-like defense coordinator of Elysium, named Delacourt. She has some kind of ridiculous plot to take control of the space station, but her purpose seems to lose its way and reason within time. She's ice-cold, and Jodie Foster is quite good at that.The point where 'Elysium' loses its metallic luster is when we realize that Blomkamp is practically spoon-feeding us. 'District 9″ was obvious in many ways, but as we pulled for Copley's character, we may not be entirely sure what Max actually stands for. It's very clear that there is a lot of social commentary here about the rate at which our real world economies are being flushed down the toilet. The rich only get more wealthy, and the poor are forced to immeasurably more desperate means of survival. However, as we wonder about the future implications of a U.S. president that many claim is a socialist in disguise, Blomkamp's discussion on the economy begins turning astray. If he's not talking about that, then what is he talking about anyway? Maybe he never really was spoon-feeding us after all.I hate to continue comparing 'Elysium' to 'District 9″, but where the grittiness and brutality worked in the latter, it seems not to push the thematic as well here. There is a scene involving some surgery, and while it's no brain operation from the 'Saw' franchise, it feels unnecessary. A woman is slapped hard across the face, and evil mercenaries are exploded into countless pieces. We sit on the edge of our seats, not so much for the adrenaline we are given, but perhaps only for the uncomfortable feeling in the pit of our stomachs, hoping to God that the next death may not be so brutal. That being said, Sharlto Copley plays an absolutely ruthless villain, named Kruger. It's really something to see. His dialogue is pretty weak, but every time he's on-screen, we cringe.I felt as if I have been a bit harsh towards 'Elysium' but as I have encouraged in previous reviews I have written, please do not take my word for it. I hope only that what I write helps you to discover details in films and entertainment that perhaps you may have missed on your first viewing. I am not a film critic by any means, but 'Elysium' unfortunately misses the mark in some areas, and those are the areas that I think matter most. I want to care for Max, but the filmmaker's don't truly give us the capacity to do so. This being said, take time to digest the films that you watch, and take the time to discuss them. Ingesting entertainment without discretion will not only brutalize your discernment, but will destroy your ability to willfully comprehend whatever you just watched.",7,0,0,17 September 2013
A Beautiful Mind," A Beautiful Mind (2001)
","Ron Howard's 'A Beautiful Mind,' contains a visual treat that I won't soon forget. I'm talking about a scene a little over halfway into the film, where our protagonist John–played by Russell Crowe (of 'Gladiator' fame)–sits in the kitchen with his wife Alicia, played by Jennifer Connelly ('Requiem for a Dream', 'Blood Diamond'). He's beginning to fall back into his disorder, and sits at a table, playing with a strange suction cup unicorn toy. Alicia is starting to grow increasingly more frustrated with John, and steps over to the refrigerator.There is a clear divide in their marriage, and even though it is portrayed so clearly on-screen, we are provided with a powerful, yet subtle reminder here. A wall literally separates the two of them, their backs are turned to one another, and although they are having a conversation, they are both concentrating on different things.This is the kind of provoking imagery that Ron Howard has put together for his audience, along with ASC Roger Deakins ('No Country for Old Men', 'Skyfall', 'Shawshank Redemption').'A Beautiful Mind' follows the true, yet flawed, story of a brilliant mathematician, named John Nash, who struggles to live with schizophrenia. We begin our excavation into his life starting first at his entry into Princeton, and our journey ends with Nash in old age. As grumpy and–for the most part, socially inept–an old fart as he was in his younger years. Regardless of his laughable social ability, he makes lifelong friends (and gets hitched) despite his strange behavior; even though he's kind of a jerk. He is quite lovable. Whether this is the beauty of Crowe's fantastic work as an actor, or the tediousness of a well-designed script, I will leave that decision up to you.Even though we focus mostly on Nash, we do spend a good portion of time with Alicia. I must say that I truly appreciated her character's devotion to John. Unfortunately, many times in film, a love interest is thrown in as an afterthought to spice up the sex appeal, but here is not the case (although, Connelly looks somewhat stunning as an older woman). What I admired most about her screen time is her unrelenting sense of hope. Granted, she does grab their child and begins driving away at one point (but you would too if your husband nearly drowned the little tot.) Alicia inspires a true feeling of redemption for Nash's character, and she sees it through until the end. A marvelous picture of the difficulties of marriage and endless perseverance through it, I assure you.Of course, Howard would never let his audience go without extra fun, and this comes in the form of actors: Christopher Plummer, Paul Bettany, and Ed Harris, who play respectively: Nash's psychiatrist, Charles (one of Nash's friendly hallucinations), and Parcher (a government agent hallucination, hell-bent on pushing Nash to decipher non-existent Russian codes from various publications and magazines.)Something that Howard does excruciatingly well here is not spoon-feeding the story to his audience. The plot isn't simple, even though the 'Fight Club-esque' reveal of 'multiple personalities' is somewhat predictable; if you know much about the film. It definitely isn't a tidy film presented in a gift-wrapped box. There are a few short scenes that make you just a bit queasy to help you understand more fully just how emotionally and physiologically painful Nash's condition was on himself and those around him. It is necessary in my opinion.There is a bit of cheese, in the form of a special pen gifting scene directed towards Nash, representing the level of respect that he had gained over the years, again, despite his medical condition. To explain the symbolism of these 'pens,' one should simply watch the film to understand. Very shortly afterwards, Nash gives his acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize. As he gazes out into the audience, he says, 'I have made the most important discovery of my career – the most important discovery of my life. It is only in the mysterious equations of love that any logic or reasons can be found. I am only here tonight because of you' His eyes fixate on Alicia, as he toys with a pocket square in his coat; a nod to an earlier moment in the film.These moments are excusably cheesy, and serve to fully send home the idea that if it was not for the persistence of Nash to push through his disease in his fashion, and if it was not for Alicia's complete devotion to him as a wife, he likely would have driven himself mad and lived in an asylum for the remainder of his life. Fortunately, this is not the case, and in light of his random outbursts at home and on-campus at Princeton, he is able to live out a strange, yet somewhat regular life.We feel only the utmost sympathy for John and Alicia, and by pushing against all odds, they find victory. We love these stories, don't we? The academy loved it enough to present it with four Oscars, including Best Picture. Isn't that nifty?The only blotch I found on this wonderful tale is the true story of John Nash. In real life, he didn't actually begin experiencing hallucinations until after his marriage with Alicia. He also had a child with a previous girlfriend, and Alicia eventually divorced him and married someone else. They remained very close friends however, and she provided him a place to stay, and helped him through his disorder. A few Hollywood modifications, to be sure, but its always a little sad when the movies are prettier than real life, isn't it?A humbling response is knowing that Nash was, and still is an astonishingly brilliant man. He still keeps office hours at Princeton, and he still walks to school everyday. An impossibly smart and beautiful mind.",8,0,0,12 June 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," A Thematic Paradise filled with Nolanites
","This summer turned me into a Nolanite, and for good cause too. I missed the premiere by two days, and it was probably the longest two days of my life. I saw it in Imax. Lucky for Chris, Nolan likes Imax camera, so lucky for Chris, I saw what Nolan saw. Also, Cinematographer Wally Pfister put together some fantastic stuff in The Dark Knight Rises.Tom Hardy continues to be an absolute TANK as Bane. Joseph Gordon Levitt steps into the fray as a 'fake sidekick Robin' of sorts.I'm not going to spend a lot of time on the story here, because the thing that I believe makes The Dark Knight Rises such a terrific movie is how well it ties the entire trilogy together. Some people are upset by the lack of Batman himself in The Dark Knight Rises, but I am amazed that Christopher Nolan could make a Batman movie that is so much more about Bruce Wayne than it is about Batman.In Batman Begins, Batman is a man. Clearly real, and a part of Bruce Wayne. In The Dark Knight, Batman has become a symbol. Finally, in The Dark Knight Rises, Batman eventually turns into a myth, and he's not Bruce Wayne anymore. Batman does not need to be a specific person, because Batman could be anyone. It doesn't matter who's under the mask.Did I mention the comparisons that The Dark Knight Rises gets away with making to Jesus Christ? A city who scorned the only one that has the capacity to save them from their own filth, and their own sins. Batman takes the blame for Harvey Dent's crimes, and he puts it all upon himself, and in the end, sacrifices himself to save all of those people who just wanted him dead or imprisoned in the first place.Or maybe the theme of 'rising from failure', or simply 'rising' throughout the movie. Batman rises from being chased and hated, to becoming a hero, who saved Gotham. Bruce Wayne rises from his old hermit-like, miserness, and tries to do what he thinks is right (become the Batman again), only to get completely owned. But once he realized his mistake, and the reasons that he failed, he is able to rise out of his own depression, and his own selfishness, to become the man that he is being called to be. Or the blatant symbolism in Bruce rising from the jail pit. Out of darkness, into the light, yadda yadda The list goes on and on. The Dark Knight Rises is absolutely rife with symbolism, and this is what makes it such a powerful story.There is something more here than just a comic book hero film. It's an examination of the human condition, and just how far someone can fall. The reminder is, 'no matter how far you fall, you fall so that you can better learn how to pick yourself back up.' It's a beautifully crafted story that I think bears reason to be told many, many times. Or in my case, seen in theaters four times. Beating The Avengers record. All of this to say, DC comics didn't have a chance until The Dark Knight Trilogy. Seriously, share this movie with those around you, and don't just leave it there. Talk about some of the themes behind this movie, because there is so much to be said about failure, and the purpose of failure. Not to mention it's really just a freaking BA movie that captures the essence of Batman so very well. If this doesn't get you excited for Man of Steel, then I have no idea how to help you.The Dark Knight Rises is a 9/10.",9,2,5,19 December 2012
Monsters University," 'Monsters' Delivers, and then some
","The ingenuity of devising a misfit character who doesn't quite fit in, within a species of creatures that, at first glance, seem entirely unrelatable, is wholly brilliant. Pixar, a studio known for originality across the board, did this extremely well in 2001 with 'Monsters, Inc.' 'Well, that was over ten years ago,' some of you might say; then perhaps you haven't heard of 'Toy Story 3'. They did it once with a franchise based upon reanimated children's toys, but can they breathe life into another aged film, this time with the premise of a prequel?The summer of 2013 rolls around, and Pixar presents us with 'Monsters University.' If you ever had questions about how our green and blue monster friends got into the scaring game, or if they belonged to the most stereotypically lame fraternity house, then look no further. There are plenty of college clichés to enjoy, from the dirt bag jocks, to the over-eager orientation leaders.Billy Crystal reprises his role of Mike Wazowski, the one-eyed, not very scary, little green man. By his side, the hunk of a blue, polka-dotted, man-bear-yeti, James P. Sullivan, or Sulley (John Goodman). 'Monsters University' shows us how the two became friends, and they didn't start out as roommates, I can promise you that. As any Pixar sequel (or prequel, for that matter) goes, we meet up with some familiar faces along the way. The dastardly Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) rears his ugly, camouflaged face, but the most fun the audience will have is through a cameo later on in the film (I won't spoil it, don't worry).Our story begins by showing us just exactly how Mike Wazowski became obsessed with the human-scaring industry. Despite being picked on by classmates as a tiny, albeit adorable, monster, Mike developed a love and admiration for upper-division scare legends as a little tyke. In this world, they swap trading cards of the elite scarers, very similar to baseball legends of yore. Ironically, Mike is given the baseball cap of his favorite and most-respected scare legend. This drives Mike to attend Monsters University so he can major in scaring and, ideally, become a legend himself one day. Over time, he meets the before-mentioned Randall and Sulley. Turns out Sulley is actually quite the bag of tools at this point in their friendship, and through an unfortunate turn of events, the two of them are kicked from the scare program, and left to major in less interesting things.The terrifying Dean Hardscrabble (Helen Mirren) is in control of the program, and gave them the boot. Mike, being the resourceful eyeball he is, thinks up a brilliant plot: join the upcoming Scare Games competition, and if he can prove he's scary enough, Hardscrabble must let him back into the program. Sulley and Mike are actually quite at odds by this point, and are forced to work together to make the plan work. They need at least six on their team, thus enters four new monsters, who together, play off of each other quite well, and actually inspires most of the humor in the film. They are clearly inept and unable to win the competition, but over time, and with lots of training, heart-searching, and a few montages, they may be able to win the coveted trophy, and the title of 'Scariest Monsters.'This is the set-up. It is a Pixar movie after all, but being older than the vast majority of children in the audience, I may have giggled at some of the slapstick at play here, but Pixar has a way of telling deep and involving stories within the animated context. With 'Up' we were presented with commentary on true love, and the theme of aging and loss. Here, Pixar toys around with a coming of age, or stepping into a new phase of life; change, if you will.There are multiple times in 'Monsters University' where Mike faces a step in front of him, quite literally actually. He can either choose to turn around and ignore it, or to step forward, make a solid choice, and walk into a new phase of life. Mike is presented with this option at least four times throughout his visual journey. We see the joys of Mike wholeheartedly accepting the new trials before him, but we also see the consequences of his actions. There is indeed a time to grow up, but there is also a time to take a moment to think about what kinds of challenges the future may hold. Luckily, our hero is ready for anything in his path, despite everyone telling him that he just isn't good enough.There are enough losers in this movie that anyone who has ever been rejected (all of us) will find someone, or some THING, to relate to. If you're fat, there is a monster for you. If you have a penchant for philosophy and deeper thinking, you are somewhat in luck. Finally, if you still live in your mother's basement and one of your best friends started dating your mother, 'Monsters University' is here for you. Outside of the deep metaphors that are presented ever so subtly, there are plenty of surface level discussions to be had.Pixar hits this one with flying colors, and it's one you are sure to be called a fool if you miss. 'Monsters University' is just too much fun, and I'm confident you will agree with me.",8,0,0,25 June 2013
Looper," Looping back to the Future
","Going into this movie, remind yourself of one thing 'Time travel will never make sense.' There. Now you can enjoy Looper.Looper is about a futuristic assassin called Well, a Looper In this case, his name is Joseph Gordon Levitt, or affectionately named, Joe. Joe gets people sent from the future, to the present, where he kills them on the spot. One day, his future-self, Bruce Willis, shows up. He's all like, 'whaaaat?' *Insert movie-long chase scene here*It's a really fun sci-fi flick that plays with different themes, and different ideas of morality. Can the end result justify a person's actions, regardless of how dark they may be? Things like that At the end of the movie, I almost felt like it was lesson in thematics, and I think it was very successful. It's a little more serious than I envisioned, like Lawless, a little more gritty than expected.Looper is a big fat 8/10.",7,4,9,19 December 2012
