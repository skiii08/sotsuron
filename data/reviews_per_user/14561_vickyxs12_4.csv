Changeling," Great Story, BUT...
","Yes, the story is captivating and truly incredible. You can't do a bad movie with this source material and this cast, but Clint Eastwood tried his best to make it as flat as possible.The characters are black or white. Either they are saints or pure evil. In this movie an idiotic police officer is portrayed as if he was as evil (or worse) than a sadistic child murderer! I get the director is trying to make a critic to a system, but if he wanted to do so and being taken seriously maybe he shouldn't have had them look pretty much like a cartoon.Other downside of this movie is its running time. Somewhere in the middle it reaches it's peak moment and after that it loses its momentum. It seems to have several ending moments but the movie goes on and on, pretty much without reason.Anyway, a very interesting story to watch.",7,0,1,21 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Choose your own Star Wars adventure!
","The Rise of Skywalker (stupid name, and this is how we begin) forces its audience to imagine a somewhat coherent answer to justify what they are seeing because the writers were too lazy to do so themselves. With over 10 movies and 200 episodes of stories set in this universe, they couldn't come up with anything that makes sense, so now we have to.How is Palpatine alive? When did he had a kid and with whom? Who was that kid and why was he good? Why nobody knew nor 'sensed' anything about this? Why at the same time Luke and Leia knew some of it all along? Why they didn't do anything about it? Since when people can teleport stuff, heal and even resurrect the dead using the force? How? Who was the mystery dead character whose name kept popping up? What did Finn wanted to tell Rey? Why Kylo didn't sense who the spy was? (and why even make HIM the spy if he didn't do anything that relevant at all all?!) Why Rey is so mighty and powerful with so little training (remember how 10 y-o Anakin was too old to train in the way of the force?)? How can Han force-ghost? What did Leia exactly do with Ben before she died? Was Leia a Jedi? If she knew about Ben going to the dark side why did she even sent him to Jedi training with uncle Luke?! Why does Rey take the Skywalker name? What's so special about the Knights of Ren? Why the ancient holocrons are now called pathfinders, they have no sith magic and even have backups? What happened to the sith's rule of two? Who were the bad cgi shadows in the throne room's tribune? Did Palpatine ever wanted Rey dead? Did he truly needed her alive?To answer this and many more questions is up to the fans for theorize. Poor lazy writing at its finest resulting in the sloppiest Star Wars movie ever made. What a shame.",5,9,22,22 December 2019
Aladdin," Soulless and cheap.
","They didn't have to come up with anything, they had a perfectly good source material right there! Yet they ruined it.I believe this is what happens when people don't understand the magic of animation but try to do a movie like this anyway. Those people being Disney is painful, Walt must be ashamed and in pain somewhere, and so should be Guy Ritchie.Bright saturated colors in cheap fabrics, colorful tiny cardboard sets and overuse of visual effects do not look magical. An uncalled elaborated choreography every couple of minutes don't tell a story. A pretty girl is not a princess, a nice guy is not a charming hero. Will Smith is not funny for the sake of it!This is all wrong. The cast is wrong, the costume and set design are wrong, the songs are flat, hell the director couldn't even use the right camera to film in those tiny rooms and maybe make it look like it actually was a city, a palace, a desert or any kind of open space! I felt like I was watching a play!",1,3,7,9 January 2020
Joker," A messy ok movie.
",The story doesn't work for this character and this character doesn't work for this movie.It's quite insulting the prestige this movie is gaining even though it's so poorly planned out. It wants to milk the 'Joker' name and fan base to please teenagers and fanboys while trying to do a new Taxi Driver and/or The King of Comedy (straight up copying-pasting so many elements!). And trying to go both ways doesn't work.The excessive amount of overexplaining and overacting is annoying and exhausting. We get it! The guy's crazy! People are mean to him! Joaquin Phoenix lost a lot of weight! None of it serves the story!Overall is an ok movie but a waste of a decent story on a comic book character that doesn't fit in it.,6,3,5,28 January 2020
