3:10 to Yuma," of a kind ...that is expected to be of western cult!!
","I am an Indian from India..not of the kind ..kevin costner depicted in 'Dances with wolves'. Some of my fav westerns includes ' The Good, the bad and the ugly', 'Once upon a time in the west' etc...to name a few. While I though western culture disappeared from this world 'Django Unchained' happened. This is one of the latest of my westerns I have watched....After watching Russell in 'The Gladiator' and ' A beautiful mind' and watching Christian bale in ' Empire of the Sun' and 'American Psycho'...It was a treat to watch both the icons together in their destiny to reach Yuma. This movie is a treat to watch provided u love westerns and having said that...It was a pleasure to watch Ben Foster...He impressed me more than my all time fav Clint Eastwood!!!!! He has loads of talent in him!!! Above all this movie gives a message only if you know and live by truth...for others u nay not mess around with people born with a purpose or destiny!!!",9,0,0,2 November 2014
The Hateful Eight," Tour-in-tino
","The first thirty minutes sucks. I felt bored to the hilt but the movie changes track after they (Kurt and Samuel) enter the cottage. The whole story unfolds there in Tarantino screenplay. The casting is perfect...the dialogs savvy and blood is just there when you least expect it. As far as Oscars are concerned...those morons better stay away from Tarantino coz he ain't their type!!! I rate this third in Tarantino's my likes-The first being Pulp, then Django!!! As far as ratings below 6 for this movie-they are of Forest Gump or Walt Disney type.I always love casting in Tarantino movies, It takes us back to the 70's. All actors are just perfect and Samuel like always in Tarantino movies just never disappoint as a savage 'NIGGER'. That word ain't derogatory....Tarantino just glorify it!!!! Amen!!!!",9,1,6,8 March 2016
The Mountain II," The path to rendition!!!
",Have watched ninety percent of the best war movies ever made by any genre on this planet by the best directors. This movie touched my soul. Although I retired from the Armed Forces in India..I never got an opportunity to take part in live combat. Had to suck in this movie with English subtitles but it kept me on the hook. Do not worry about scumbags who have rated this movie as a matter of propaganda....Just watch it for the raw feeling about what life is all about being in the war front. From the beginning to the end....It gives us an insight into the atrocities of war and how lives are changed not only for those who are thrust into it by sheer love for their country but also for those lives falling in between enemy lines. Never seen the first part of this edition ....Well I don't have to!!!! Just watch it not for the love of cinema...but for it's raw form and never forget to give a rating.,10,5,18,3 June 2018
The Shawshank Redemption," Hope is a good thing.
","Of a lifetime worth forty years- I never saw a movie that impressed me like this. You may not call it a perfect story but this movie just moves your soul...no wonder..it is the highly rated movie in IMDb. Two reasons why I loved this movie. Firstly the silence of Tim Robbins and the euphoria around Morgan Freeman. The scene on the terrace where Tim Robbins proves his mettle is a reminder of our latent abilities. This movie also reminds of survival instincts in real life wherein we should not lose hope when it comes to making choices. Two other movies that I loved in this perspective were 'Cast Away' and 'Catch me if you can'!!! Not sure if they were all based on real life incidents but if you ever happen to live a life,make a movie,write a book... Do it this way!!! Amen!!!!",10,0,0,8 February 2015
