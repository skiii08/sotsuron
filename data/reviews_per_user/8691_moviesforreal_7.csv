Scarface," everything is great except the awful script
",The performance's are great it's well filmed good action a fine ending but the script is awful about 30 percent of the dialogue is good but the rest is terrible i know that a lot of people like this film but i just don't really see anything to like about it and for the first 30 minutes i can't even tell what al pacino is even saying he just mumbles the movie is also way to long the movie is overrated in my opinion but yeah this film is just not for me sorry.,Null,0,1,2 May 2018
Terminator Salvation," what the hell
",This movie makes no sense at all the script and plot is such a mess the acting is bad the action is pretty boring and the movie actually gets worse as it goes along i find no enjoyment in this movie at all the special effects are ugly the color pallet is also very ugly and it's pg-13 the first three were rated r you can't just go to pg 13 just like that but i have noting else to really say sorry.,1,0,5,31 May 2018
Coco," visually stunning cool concept bad script
","So i think it looks great like all pixar films a fine concept wasted on a predictable, chicle scrip the voice acting was fine for most of the part but it was just so damn predictable and it just ends up as a disappointment.",3,4,19,2 May 2018

Black Panther," disappointing movie
",The main reason's i saw this film is because i like the director and this was the last movie before infinity war so when i saw it this movie felt longer than infinity war it felt like i was there for a whole day the jokes are terrible the script is weak the acting is fine but 70 percent of the cgi was terrible it like they moved the normal marvel cgi team to infinity war and put only four people to do cgi for this and this movie is irritatingly overrated and i hear a lot of morons say if you don't like it your racist just no it's a weak scripted film and also the director ryan coogler did not know how to do a film of this type just because he did good indi film's does not mean he can do a film of this size he had to lose the 60 millimeter he could not do things he wanted to do in the end this film is just disappointing.,3,2,3,11 May 2018

The Matrix," boring poorly acted and dumb but visually stunning
",Keanu reeves is terrible the other actors are boring at best but this films action is fine the concept is great it's just the awful script some of the effects are really horrible looking at a lot of points but it still looks ok i truly wanted to like it but i just could not i don't know why it is being called one of the best movies of all time it has a grey ugly look to it to and again keanu reeves is just so terrible because he is a terrible actor and if you say oh but he was good in john wick he is good in that because he hardly ever talks this movie was only popular because the effects were good at the time but now they are terrible looking this movie should have just stayed in the matrix it's self.,2,0,3,2 May 2018
