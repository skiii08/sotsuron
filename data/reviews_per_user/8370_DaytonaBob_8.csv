Alien 3," Should have been called ALIEN 3rd RATE!
","The funny thing about this movie and I don't mean funny haha, but that the acting is good, the sets are okay, but what really reeked in this movie was the plot.I MEAN IT REALLY SUCKED! This is science fiction. YOU CAN DO ANYTHING. Yet they had to revert to the same old plot used in the first movie which was one of the best science fiction/horror movies ever made if not THE BEST horror movie ever made. Trapped with no weapons. Oh geeez give me a break.As I said as well, you can do anything. Meet the original race. Go to another ship. Make the story a few years later. AND this piece of dreck makes watching the second Aliens, which I consider the best sequel, with a plot arc that makes sense, ever made, sort of worthless because you now know no one gets out alive.One of the endearing qualities to ALIENS was Ripley saving Newt and then forming a mother daughter bond wherein Ripley says she won't let anything happen to her.AND on top of that...GIVE ME A BREAK! HOW DID THE ALIEN plant eggs?The alien plants embryos in the sleeping people? How lame is that? Where did they come from? The Queen alien was dead, did an alien managed to jump on the shuttle, plants eggs it was carrying and then die? OR WTF? Made no sense. None at all.So yeah the photography is good, the acting is good, the storyline was unbelievable (and we are talking science fiction here) and it basicaly comes across as a mess with no real direction and definitely no plot arcs that make you suspend your disbelief.I gave it a 1 and was trying to figure out how to give it a MINUS 10.",Null,483,508,27 January 2005
That Thing You Do!," SPOILER ALERT! A few things I didn't agree with
","First I LOVED this movie and probably have watched it close to two hundred times. No really I have. AND I own the DVD.The movie is obviously a compendium of bands from the early to mid sixties that came to be known (and are still)as one hit wonders. One Trick Ponies is the other most used description.From the opening shots and the opening music Hanks did a superb job of making us feel like we had been transported to 1964. My jaw about hit the ground.The stores, the settings took me back to my days in Ohio not far from Erie PA in the same year. Scary actually.The band comes together in a very logical way. Just a very good arc from Point A to Point B to Point C. The discovery of the band? Absolutely logical. Small time managers who sell the rights to their band to the upper echelons of music companies who can sell them further upwards as well. Play-Tone is, from the looks of the place, a mid-level to lower-upper level company. Not in the same league as Capitol but just below them.The bit with the traveling bands was straight out of'Dick Clark's Cavalcade of Stars' It was extremely well done and the way it really was. Very few bands could do the arenas and almost none could do stadiums. So State Fairs were the way to go(and still are if you really look around)Where I started to lose the belief in the storyline was how T.B. Player(I love that)just bugged out on the band. The Marines would have been all over themselves to get into a taping of a show on the level of The Ed Sullivan Show.Lenny was an actually talented guitar player and I find it difficult to believe he would leave the band in a lurch on recording day. Not believable at all.In the year they are supposed to be in, the belief that bands had to do STRICTLY other people's stuff wasn't true any longer. The Wonders had shown they were capable of writing great stuff and Mr. White should have seen that and in real life would have. Play-Tone would have wanted to be cutting edge and compromised by allowing several songs they wanted and several songs the band wanted. The material they played on tour was good and Mr. White would have had enough clout to make it work. The band would have then been sent to open for big time bands like The Beach Boys who were on Arena tours at that point. I saw them at Cincinnatti Gardens with 4 opening acts.THEN after a few more months and maybe the album doing poorly and the band starting to crumble under the weight of touring(which was a major point of breakups back then) I could see Lenny wanting to go someplace with no pressure and Saich wanting to go to the studio and Guy lusting after Faye who was back in Erie, and the Jazz life. THEN it would have made more sense. BUT I understand the shooting schedule and the need to wrap it up.Just felt the ending didn't work. Other than that I gave it a TEN.",Null,1,2,4 December 2004
Avengers: Infinity War," The WHOLE Universe? SERIOUSLY? Silliness abounds. SPOILERS
","The movie was mostly a lot of CGI and a lot more fighting. ALL neat to watch. BUT the idiocy of believing there are a handful of little stones that control the ENTIRE UNIVERSE? All the neat outer space scenes and strange alien landscapes all of that.BUT to say he would be able to control the ENTIRE Universe?I am sorry but that is beyond ridiculous.I am huge Marvel fan and can actually say I have been reading Marvel since FF#4. And at one time had almost every single issue of the comics they put out until the mid 70s. They were great fun.This movie on the other hand is silly. One person with a handful of stones controls the ENTIRE UNIVERSE.Do the writers at Marvel et al have any clue as to the size of the universe and that is just what we have been able to see? The bazillions and gazillions of GALAXIES, the number of planets would be a ONE followed by millions of zeros. The amount of beings, and all sorts of life forms would be a One followed by a number of zeros so large it is unfathomable.I would have bought say, the galaxy. But this stupidity of the entire universe was just that.Seriously lame. Silly and beyond any sense of rational thought. YES it is comics and just a movie but the primary belief in how to enjoy a movie is the SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF. Sorry, NO. And on top of that it all centered around a small planet in one of the arms of the Milky Way closer to the edge of the end of the arm than otherwise. Really? HOW did we get so lucky in the ENTIRE UNIVERSE.We are supposed to believe the Thanos character would have the ability to wipe out half of that? BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAI love Marvel but this should have been an insult to anyone with more than 2 brain cells to rub together. Oh well I hope we don't get a conclusion that reminds me of an old Saturday Morning serial of Jungle Jim where at the end of the episode where we had to come back next Saturday to that theater to find out how he got out of the predicament of being caught in a HOLE half way done and below him were lions ready to tear him apart and above him were natives ready to rip him apart and cook him.So how did he get out of it? Well Next Saturday's episode started with the voice over stating: 'After Jungle Jim got out of his last trap he headed towards the nearest village' Seriously that is how they did it.So are we going to get either this was an alternate universe?
A dream that when one of them gets out of the shower his wife says I had the strangest dream?
Or .....? 'Thanos you bad boy, Where have you been? Your father and I have been looking all over dozens of universes. Now you put things right or you are going to get such a paddling when we get back to home!'Thanos: 'Aw gee mom you never let me have any fun'This will be the only interesting part is what silliness they use to restore the universe to its natural order minus some nutjob like Thanos.Gods above and below that was an awful movie but it was cool to see all the Superheroes in one movie.. So glad I could watch it at home and fast forward through all the fighting.BUT ya gotta hand it to the fanboys who have posted it was the greatest cinematic effort in the history of the world. And the one guy who said anyone who says differently then IMDB should immediately pull the review and probably publicly flog the person who wrote it.",Null,5,11,17 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A quick further note about 'professional' reviews.
",The professional reviews? Either paid for or written for them by the studio. You cannot have this many terrible reviews here by people who saw the movie and believe Metacritic and RT are the real reviews. Or else they were given a different movie. Don't waste your money on this movie.,Null,3,3,17 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Rian Should be run out of town tarred and feathered.(spoliers)
","When Rian said he did not give a damn what fans wanted and this was his vision, THAT should have given everyone a serious clue that this was going to be the same of the 'reimagined' Fantastic Four which bombed horribly. BUT since this is Star Wars it will bring in a ton of money because fanboys and idiot viewers are just that lame. It says Star Wars...that is all they need to hear.ANY high ratings are phony and pushed by studio shills who are seeing the writing on the wall. This may very well spell the end of the Franchise or at the least begin the fall of Star Wars due to jackass directors who feel it is time to destroy the JEDI Mythology and call it dead and start some other nonsense.The Leia scene will start a million debates as well. Ren? Wow, kill off Jedi's but give her Mary Sue powers in jig time? Sorry but her acting is wooden as is so many of the other actors. The character of Poe is perhaps the most interesting character. Hollywood is going overboard turning over franchises to women stars. Be careful of what you wish for...you might get it. The director seemed more interested in getting rid of Star Wars beliefs as fast as possible. Rian completely lost what Star Wars was always supposed to be about. I walked out of TFA shaking my head,,,this time I left angry at the travesty he foisted upon us.Sorry but this ranks as the same or worse than The Force Awakens aka A New Hope 2.0.",Null,3,4,17 December 2017
Love Actually," Wonderful Actually
","I am beyond mystified by those who attempt to critique this movie as though it was supposed to be on the par of Gone With The Wind or something equally 'important'.It was a great movie with an upbeat attitude towards finding love whether you had it and didn't realize it, discovered it for the first time or just found the right person, but were a dollar short and a day late.The characters are not supposed to be DEEP or well fleshed out, they are just characters in a story about LOVE not characters. I have come to the conclusion that those who hated it or took it apart have no souls or are afraid of love. No other reason could exist. That or they think 'JACKASS' is the height of comedic talent and can't get past egger humor.Some of the comedy highlights are laugh out loud. Nighy's character as an old rocker getting his second wind was just fabulous and his comment during the TV show about not paying for drugs just made me laugh loudly.Hugh Grant was just terrific. His character is the PM and just like those further down the ladder of life is looking for love and it comes out of nowhere. I especially found his accommodation of the three little girls to be particularly nice. Too bad you know something like that would never happen in real life. Politicians are too in love with themselves to think of others.Alan Rickman's character is perhaps my favorite. I do have to agree he should have made a romantic overture of some sort near the end. Would have made it perfect. BUT I can relate.I wondered about the differing 'class' schools as well until I saw it for a second (and third and fourth) time and realized there is a quick comment about several schools coming together for the first time to do this show.The story involving Keira Knightly was so bittersweet as to be heartrending. Finding love but just a little too late.My second favorite was the little boy Ben and his newly discovered True Love. That boy should go places, what an actor.The funniest are the porn stars. Just funny as all hell. Having worked in that industry years ago(as a cameraman)I can relate to seeing people in that situation having a hard time relating to people in a way those outside of the industry could never understand. Just funny funny funny.The most romantic though was the writer and his housekeeper. That was my favorite. Love can transcend borders, language and culture differences.The best fantasy was the English young man going to America to get some. You do have to think the director would have done the obvious and have him come back to England realizing he could find love at home. BUT he doesn't and the end result is hilarious. Loved that bit.So for all those naysayers out there, get over it, this was not supposed to 'Lawrence of Arabia' or anything of that ilk, just a nice, funny romantic movie.No heavy characterizations needed.No Oscar worthy dialog ala Shakespere.No deep understanding of back stories.No delving into why a PM would love a commoner.No wondering why the director didn't direct this as though he was going after the Oscar of all time.(BUT ya know I would love to see the extra 80 minutes I keep hearing about on a director's cut DVD, maybe a special order only release ya know? With the Angel bit and all that.)The director did a fine job of conveying the point behind his movie.Love actually is all around us. We just need to open our eyes.That's all.",Null,1,3,13 January 2005
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," SPOILER ALERT! This movie was CR**! Hurting pets for laughs?
","I just finished watching this unmitigated piece of total human waste.The movie itself is just sooooo not funny. I kept waiting for something to happen and sure enough nothing did. Helloooo! There is a saying in movies that in order for them to work you have to suspend your disbelief. Impossible in this piece of crud.Will Farrell must have been the only actor desperate enough for work to take this role. Christina must have done it for the money because she was between gigs. The attempts at humor are so flat as to be embarrassing.It actually started out with a decent premise of self absorbed anchormen of the 70's and a woman trying to break into the world of anchors both locally and nationally ala Barbara Walters, Connie Chung, etc, but within 15 minutes I was squirming at how bad it was. ELF was almost as bad.The script looks as though they had no idea of what to say so they just let the cast try and come up with lines and it shows. I just can't get over how bad this movie was and how UNFUNNY it was.Will's character just didn't ever seem to make sense. A jazz flutist who is a moron? Terrible pickup lines that make you squirm yet a lovable but nice guy who has little experience with women but is a great lover? None of this made any sense. The dialog is just horrendous as well and dragging as well. I mean dragging.It was convoluted as well. It just seemed to go all over the place without reason. OR laughs.The weatherman character was embarrassing at how badly it was done. Very unfunny as well. THEN they kill a pet dog (or it appears to be done) for laughs or something as I am not sure but whatever jerk decided this was a good plot device needs serious help. The crew and cast should have stopped it dead in it's tracks as well. HURTING A PET TO PROMOTE A PLOT DEVICE IN A COMEDY??? WTF were they thinking. Yeah the dog lives but what a horrible plot device.This movie is just plain offensive in how poorly written it was and it is beyond me as to the amount of people who saw it and thought it was funny. Talk about playing to the lowest common denominator.What is wrong with Hollywood and just how bad is it that they can't find writers who can write funny stuff that this crud is foisted off on us.Do these people writing this watch the finished product and laugh at it or are they just too embarrassed to admit it was terrible and laugh to prop themselves up in front of each other rather than admit it was crud?Something else. I can spot shill praise a mile away and there is so much of it on here as to be sad. Look at the style of writing from all these people who praise. You know ANYONE who writes like that that is not a professional? Sad for studios to have to hire people to heap false praise on this terrible movie. AND several of them if not all sound very similar in style of writing.",Null,0,1,29 December 2004
Alien: Covenant," Awful and Incredibly predictable.
","I keep wondering why this franchise is still alive. The series has become completely predictable in how each movie will end. I mean seriously awful.The directing by Scott is boilerplate at this point. Did he even bother showing up or did he just phone it in to an AD? I am serious.The writing was as boilerplate as well. As much as they can possible get. I figure they put maybe 3 to 4 hours writing the script after a good 3 minutes of writing the plot then everyone went out and got drunk.The crew as is in every horrible movie is a dumb as they come. WHY? Does no one has any kind on intelligence on these ships? HELL we quarantined astronauts just for going to the moon.They are looking for a signal so they land FIVE miles from the signal. No flying over it, see what it is, realizing it is an alien spacecraft and saying. WE ARE OUT OF HERE. Or at the least landing as close as possible all suited up do a quick check and realize something is wrong in paradise and get the hell out of there and on their way.BUT as usual the writers and director make the crew as dumb as rocks. In real like you'd have to ask yourself how they all got the job.Poor writing to the point of why bother staying after the first 45 minutes as nothing is going to be different than any other alien movie. Hell they could have actually made the movie ten minutes long. Of course no horror effects then.Badly disappointing. Glad I didn't bother paying for this dreck.However on the good side.GREAT special effects guys...that is the only reason it got a ONE. Otherwise a ZERO.",Null,5,6,5 March 2018
