Requiem for a Dream," there is no waking up from this Dream
","Let me be the first to mention exactly how powerful this film is. This film can very well change your life for the better. It is quite possibly the greatest gem in filming to be released since American Beauty. But even though this diamond is huge, it has a few faults. First it seems to lose its seriousness at points, and certain points seem random and err, well quite odd. That being said, this could be the greatest film ever. It has that eerieness that even when something seems so comical you cannot laugh. It is terrible to see what happens to these people, and I could hardly say that this movie will make you feel good once its over. At the end, more than likely you will sit in your seat for a minute just processing what you saw. This movie gives no hope, no beaken of light, and it shows the absolute worst case scenarios. If you think that our world is perfect, then Requiem will wake you up from that dream quickly, and once you wake up, you will only want to go right back to sleep. Definitely a powerful film. 9/10Pros: Characters feel real, it remains dark and bleak, tremendous acting.Cons: Repetition of one scene in particular where drug use is shown, however different the drugs or the process of using it, this scene stays the same. Honestly, thats all I can think of.Go buy this film, or at the very least, rent it and never bring it back to the store.",Null,0,0,18 March 2004
Lost in Translation," Lost in the Magic
","Let me be the first to tell you that love stories and me do not mix. I usually hate them, and never ever find the stories real or even thought provoking. Now putting that aside, I absolutely love this film.
The story is about a man named Bob going through his MidLife crisis. He feels uncared for, especially in a completely foreign place like Japan. He does commercials, and absolutely hates it. He used to be a movie star, what a disgrace! Anyways, he is in Japan when he runs into Catherine. Now is the time I started thinking 'OH GREAT, another one, they will fall in love and get married yadah yadah yadah.' Imagine my surprise that this film stays as down to earth as it can get, even in an area I [living in America my entire life] found almost alien. The film portrays emotions and the problems between two completely different people who have a chance meeting. The film is so incredibly deep that it can satisfy anyone who enjoys Indie films. Plot? There is none! Absolutely none! And I still loved this movie!See it once, then view it again. It is a must see!9/10Pros: Wonderful acting, realistic portrayal of people, funny yet at the same time sad.Cons: One particular scene involving a red head. I shouted 'Bob how can you do that!' The movie would have done great without it.",9,1,2,16 March 2004
A Clockwork Orange," Shockwork Orange
","If I could sum up Clockwork Orange in two words, they would be shocking and delightful. Being made in 71, I found it hard to believe half the stuff they showed in this movie could even be shown now without angry moms revolting. But behind the tremendously dark sattire is surprizingly much substance. The film showcases quite possibly the craziest guy I have ever seen shown in a movie, he makes villains in comic books look perfectly normal. They also make him the hero, recounting exactly what led him up to the conclusion. I cannot sum up the rest of the story, because to try to say the plot would probably make me look stupid. It really is something that must be seen to be believed.9/10 Pros: Brilliantly written script, funny dark humor, Review value [I've seen this film 10 times and it keeps getting better!], Great acting, and a brilliant score.Cons: The only real problem I could think of is the language, which at times can seem a chore to listen and comprehend. A cult classic that needs to be seen to respect filming, period!",Null,0,0,25 March 2004
Vanilla Sky," Vanilla, the worst scoop of Ice Cream you can get.
","Really, I would love to say that this film blew me away to an unmeasurable height. It was a treat, to say the least, and it did offer entertainment. However, as many pros I can say about this movie, I can also mention cons. The movie has some quality grade A actors and actresses, but it seems the performances they play are week at best. The story is hardly simple, a man who vows to never fall in love does, but of course once he does it upsets his Ex and she drives him off a bridge severely disfiguring his face. Sounds interesting, and the execution is descent enough to keep you watching. Towards the end though, everything changes. And I mean everything, the nice Romance turns into a bizarre horror story from hell. That is all this movie ends up being, and unfortunately, the ending makes you even angrier. Hardly, if I do say so myself, a good twist. It seemed more or less like the entire movie revolved around this 'twist' and the depth leading up to it was shallow. A descent movie, to say the least, but hardly my favorite scoop of ice cream.6.5/10 Pros: Good first half, some funny moments, cool scene at the dance room, very quotableCons: To many twists and turns in what could have been a good film, low quality acting, I recommend watching this film, but don't go in expecting a masterpiece. It is descent, but hardly the greatest film I have ever seen",Null,0,1,22 March 2004
