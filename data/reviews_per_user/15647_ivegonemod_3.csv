Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Amazing in 3D!
","The only reason I wanted to see this movie is because I'm into 3D right now, and the 3D effects in one of my favorite movies, Titanic, were plenty lame. I usually avoid anything to do with slavery like the bubonic plague because it's too heavy and bothersome for me, but I went to see this anyway, and I am so thrilled that I did. I enjoyed this very much, especially in 3D, the effects were killer! I wasn't familiar with any of the cast, which is fine, because I don't care about such things. I thought the acting was on point. I was really pleased with the actors who played Abraham and Speed. I also was highly intrigued by the female vampire. Henry was an interesting character and had very much appeal. The head vampire guy had the creepiest eyes. I have to say that when Bejamin Walker was swinging that ax during the New Orleans plantation scenes, he was looking TO DIE FOR in that long overcoat. I think I could watch the movie again just for those scenes! Lots of action, good acting, good plot; obviously far-fetched but still a good plot. I wish that Speed didn't get killed though.",Null,3,7,1 July 2012
Halloween," I like it and I can't stand it
","I have seen this movie at least forty times, it was released the year I was born and I love to look at the 1970's clothing. I suppose those are odd reasons to keep looking at a movie you can't really stand, but I suppose I kind of like it too.Halloween is very creepy towards the start. The scenes where the doctor and the nurse are driving to the sanitarium are excellent. I get chills just thinking about them! I would have to say that only other truly scary scene is the one where the camera pans the room at the end of the movie.It's unfortunate, but too many things got on my nerves. Annie spilled a little butter on the bottom of her shirt and for some reason feels the need to strip and wash her clothes in the laundry room outside the house. The way she rubs at the stains you would think they were all over her chest, but you can clearly see the butter only splashed on the bottom.Once the terror begins for Laurie, she becomes incapable of doing a scene that does not include a bunch of groaning and grunting. I could barely stand it!The young boy in the movie hears Laurie banging on the front door like a crazy person, but he takes his sweet time opening it for her. I wanted to punch him.I always hated that Michael was able to do things no human should have been able to do. Somehow he could pop up in front of you from nowhere and he could fall several stories and get up. Michael could also vanish when he wanted to.",Null,2,4,31 October 2018
Fifty Shades of Grey," What a dud!
","I didn't read the book prior to watching the movie, but had read extensive reviews on both before viewing. I tried to be objective and put everything I'd come across out of my head just to be fair.I was expecting to feel various ways, but I was not expecting to feel bored out of my skull. Fifty shades of grey was hard for me to get through without nodding off.I didn't think the acting was heinous on Jamie Dornan's part, but I did find him to be a bit robotic. I believe the script didn't help him out at all.I actually couldn't stand Dakota Johnson's performance. All the overreacting and nauseating Mmmmm's every time Christian touched Anastasia was just too much. The lip biting was supposed to be innocently sexy, but it made my skin crawl. She didn't do it right. I hated her voice. I'm not sure if she was trying to sound like a breathless pre-teen most of the time, but if she was; she did succeed at that.Christian would scarcely put a finger on her and she would be writhing and wriggling around like he was doing something more. There were times when he wasn't doing anything at all and she would moan and act like he was.During some of the bondage scenes, you would swear she was being beaten based on the expressions and sounds she made. It was way too much for just one wimpy smack on the bottom, very unrealistic.I didn't find anything good about this movie. The soundtrack was too loud. Everything was just wrong. The plot had no intensity. What a flop-O.",Null,5,11,24 March 2015
