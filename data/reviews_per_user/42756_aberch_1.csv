Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The movie that revolutionized the movie industry.
","This will go down as one of the greatest movies of all time. It had visual effects that make you drool. These graphics were so great, it makes the plot look a little deeper. Critics say that this movie has no plot, but how many movies don't have this plot. The good guys versus the bad guys to save the girl. The Lightsaber duel is the greatest action scene ever. I found myself on the edge of my seat, sweating and thrusting my arms as if I could help. If you are to see any movie, I would recommend The Phantom Menace over any other movie ever made.",10,0,0,24 May 1999
