Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Overrated and Tiresome
","I sure am tired of all the snobbery displayed by the self-anointed film afficionadoes over the 'Kill Bill' movies.  The films are simply not good. Yes, they are stylish and have some great action sequences, but the dialogue is poor (unusual for Tarantino), the plot uninteresting, and large swaths of the footage wasted.  I understand he dragged it out in order to split it into two films, but to me, the best part is still the very first sequence of the first film.  It would have made a better single film; instead we get two pieces of drawn-out schlock.KB2 is most noteworthy in that the body count and gore is way down from the first film.  Best of all, as a kid who grew up on Kung Fu, I really enjoyed seeing 'Grasshopper' again.  When the best thing you can say about a film is that it evokes nostalgia, you know you have a stinker on your hands.",7,0,1,11 May 2004
Catch Me If You Can," Very Enjoyable
","I've seen more movies than usual this year, and I can't recall one I've enjoyed this much save possibly 'Two Towers,' which could have used some more editing IMO.  'Catch' is just pure fun with a great performance by DiCaprio, and as usual, Hanks makes it all look easy.  I have no idea how close this film is to the true story, but I sure enjoyed it.  8 out of ten.",8,0,0,27 December 2002
Minority Report," Good movie that stays pretty close to author's style
","SPOILER WARNINGI saw this last night and absolutely loved the first two thirds of it.  The ending devolved into a drawn-out mish mash that strayed away from the spirit of Philip K. Dick's writing, but was still satisfying.  The first part of the movie did a very good job of sticking within Dick's style of story, common elements of which are: 1) What is reality?, 2) drug use (he had a problem), and 3) who is good/evil?  The more I think about the ending, the more frustrated I become.  I have not read the short story upon which this was based, but I would say the point at which we see Anderton lowered into Containment would probably have been Dick's ending.  Not only that, it would have come AFTER Max von Sydow's character killed himself and we saw Anderton reunited with his pregnant wife, meaning the 'happy' ending was a figment of Anderton's imagination. Tim Blake Nelson's character said something about 'all your dreams come true' because of the halo and being in stasis.  It's possible that having the warden say that was Spielberg's way of suggesting the end wasn't what we thought.  It's also possible Spielberg had it right but later got cold feet when the ending wasn't happy--the closeups of Anderton's face after he was haloed and as he was being lowered into stasis, plus the dream quality of the end sequence of him with his pregnant wife and the pre-cogs on an isolated farm, would fit in to this theory--but they sure seemed to make it clear there was a happy ending.  I highly recommend 'Ubik,' 'Man in the High Castle,' and 'The Collected Stories of Philip K. Dick,' which is a five-volume collection of his short stories, to anyone who enjoyed this movie.  'Blade Runner,' 'Total Recall,' and 'Screamers' are other movies based on Dick stories, but with the exception of 'Screamers' (an otherwise bad movie) they so butchered his original story it was virtually unrecognizable.",8,1,2,27 June 2002
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Overrated
","I saw this on 8/20, and I must say I was disappointed. I saw a lot of hype about it from critics of all people, saying it was right up there with 'Wedding Crashers' for comedy. My wife and I enjoyed 'Crashers,' so, despite pore-hype and review misgivings, I figured it would be worth it to hear her laugh that hard again.Well, I didn't hear her laugh very much. I had a couple of chuckles, but let me assure you this is nowhere near the level of 'Wedding Crashers'' relatively low bar.It did have its moments, but it seemed to be 'let's cuss a whole lot; that's always funny.' Don't waste your money, wait for the DVD.",5,8,20,20 August 2005
Pearl Harbor," Blockbuster Backlash
","I must say I'm not sure why so many people rate this a 1, unless it is a case of Blockbuster Backlash.  They hate any big movie released by a major. Either that, or they're wanting to be in some sort of club.I saw all the poor reviews of the movie and was disheartened because I wanted it to be good.  I decided to see it anyway just for the battle sequences.  Possibly my opinion of the movie was improved by my own low expectations (much as I was disappointed in 'Gladiator' because of high expectations), but I think the movie is good on its own terms.It combines good action, excellent special effects, and a so-so story with one of the defining moments in world history and comes out a winner.  While its grip with history is often merely tenuous, it is an exposure to more history than the average American knows, to our shame.  I think that's reason enough to see the movie.Is it Best Picture caliber?  No, but neither was 'Gladiator' and look what happened to it.",8,0,0,29 May 2001
Moulin Rouge!," Best Picture of 2001
","I'm a war movie-loving male, and I thought I would hate 'Moulin Rouge.' However, the wife had been wanting to see it, so I borrowed it on DVD for her to watch.  I sat in the room with her reading while she watched it, and my suspicions seemed to be confirmed.  Way too much weird stuff going on! Confused, random, and pointless it seemed.  Then that 'Roxanne' tango sung by a very annoying voice.  Yep, I hated it.  However...I sure liked that scene where they sang Dolly Parton's 'I Will Always Love You.'  While strange, the opera-singing moon was an interesting touch. You know, that hindu scene was kind of cool too.  And the end really seemed to pack a wallop.  Maybe I should sit down and watch it again, this time paying attention? Was I ever blown away!  What a wonderful, beautiful movie.  I wound up watching the entire movie three times this weekend, NOT counting the time I read while my wife watched.  I replayed many of the scenes several times as well, in particular the Green Fairy scene (Kylie Monogue is rather tasty), the love song medley, the hindu scene, and the forgiveness scene at the end.Sure there are some plot holes and mistakes, but with the vision and beauty (as well as freedom, truth, and love - heh), I can overlook a few mistakes. 
Loved it, loved it, loved it.  9 out of 10.",9,1,2,4 March 2002
The Great Raid," Rousing, Spirited, and Clean
","I saw this movie August 6 as a sneak preview. I enjoyed it very much, as I have always been a history buff, particularly of the Pacific Theater of WWII and have always enjoyed well-made war movies.The acting is good, the action well-choreographed, and the suspense palpable. I do feel a bit more of the interpersonal stories should have been cut, but it did not overly distract from the film.In retrospect, I can't recall any foul language and the violence was chiefly of the implied rather than graphic variety, aside from showing the aftermath of some off-screen violence.I highly recommend it.",8,9,16,7 August 2005
Sin City," Excessive Style, Almost No Substance
","I was very excited about seeing this movie after the reviews on this site, despite the lackluster review my local paper (Dallas Morning News) gave it. I have to say the paper was more correct than the IMDb reviews. The film had its moments, but unfortunately they were few and far between. I'd say there were several good acting jobs, if you consider caricatures acting, among them Willis, Rourke, and del Toro. Brittany Murphy almost seemed like she belonged, but they let her talk too much.If you're looking for lots of skin and lots of gratuitous violence with a dearth of story, this is the movie for you. I hope the next time someone films Frank Miller material it is 'The Dark Knight Returns.'",5,3,6,7 April 2005
Gangs of New York," Over wrought, over long, and over-rated
","Just got home from seeing this movies, and it bored me to tears.  it had its moments, and was at times shocking for its violence and sex, but it seems as if those instances were put in as merely that...shock value.  I felt that summed up the essence of the movie: a long drawn out 'E-P-I-C' wanna be that showed lots of thing while telling nothing.  Wait for it at the dollar show.",6,0,0,26 December 2002
