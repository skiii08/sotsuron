The Mask," Is that Jim Carrey's face or just special effects?
","Based on the original, highly violent comic, The Mask bursts on to the screen with dazzling special effects and Jim Carrey's face. The story of the comic book has changed slightly, making the evil mask turn loser Stanley Ipkiss into a hero, rather than a cop killing psycho. I believe in among all the special effects, most males will see this movie for the co-star Cameron Diaz. Jim Carrey definitely suits the role, and so does his dog Milo, who steals the spotlight in some places. If you're looking for a laugh, you may as well pick this up.",Null,3,3,21 September 1998
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Amazing effects - great acting - good story.
","Quite an awesome movie for '88, with cartoon characters integrated with live actors for the first, and possibly last time. Disney pulled it off very well, the actors blended in well and it all seems to work nicely. I enjoyed it a lot, but it depends on taste. It does go a few ways - as in at one stage it tries to be a kids comedy movie while other parts appeal to adults. Either way I enjoyed it. (Oh, and yes, if you freeze frame it just as you see Jessica spinning out of the toon taxi...)",8,0,0,19 October 1998
Predator," An sci-fi action flick with a special feel to it.
","I'm not sure what it is, but this tale of an alien hunter has a special something that makes it highly enjoyable. The actors have been cast well, and the effects are magnificent, there's a certain tensity about it and it keeps interest throughout. If you haven't seen it before, my suggestion is to run down to the video shop and grab a copy.",Null,0,0,13 September 1998
