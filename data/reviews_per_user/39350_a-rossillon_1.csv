Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Laughed So Hard, My Stomach Hurt
","I have to be honest, I had never heard of Borat before this film or the Ali G Show. I laughed so hard during some of the scenes that my stomach hurt after the movie was over. Comic Genius to sum up Cohen's performance. What was very interesting and what probably the majority of people will overlook, is how Cohen gets people to express how they TRULY feel about some topics: Muslims, Slavery, Jews, Terrorists, etc. Cohen was great during the film, I really enjoyed it and will place a pre-order on Amazon when the website allows it. Cohen does a great job. Strongly recommend NOT having young children see this film as some scenes are somewhat 'revealing.' Great movie with many laughs, MUST SEE WITH OPEN MIND!!! 10/10 for Comic Genius!!!",10,0,34,24 December 2006
