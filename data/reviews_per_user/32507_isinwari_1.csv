The New World," Slow movie / Masterpiece
","The movie is extremely slow, they kiss for an hour or so and they run trough fields and forests for the rest of the film, This movie it's good only for old lady's and people with insomnia as it instantly puts you to sleep.The war scene as it's only one , Shows some naked indians hammering some heavy armoured soldiers but there's no blood or bodies and lasts for 2-3 minutes, as for the rest of the time you will be bored to tears. It does not teach you history, it's not an War movie, it's not a love story, it's... about nothing really.Imagine that i'm writeing this comment and the movie is still running in the background... I hope it will be finish by the time i'm done... There is absolutely nothing alse to say about the movie but IMDb forces me to put more words befour i can post. ............................................. Yes it's a masterpiece , They manage to acomplish nothing, which is very hard this days, you can make a bad movie, you can make a good one... but it takes a real genius to make a movie that is about nothing , Have good actors that have no lines and leaves your mind black after watching it. ( No Comment ) On the good side... Costumation looks real. And old people will love'it... Very old people !Have fun",2,3,5,4 August 2008
