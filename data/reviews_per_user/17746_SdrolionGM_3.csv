Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Only Decent, and certainly NOT a worthy addition to the series- spoilers
","Had 'The Phantom Menace' not been in the Star Wars series, I might have been able to forgive its faults.  Its attachment to that excellent series of films, though, makes this film a real insult. Among the problems... Every SINGLE good thing in the film happens completely by accident.  The good guys have no plan.  They accidentally meet Jar-Jar...well, okay, that isn't a good thing, but we were supposed to THINK it was.  They accidentally meet up with Anakin.  Jar-Jar accidentally blows up the droids in the battle between Gungun and battle droid armies...might I add that having Jar-Jar do anything other than what is loosely called comic relief is a horrible idea. Heck, the big evil battleship of doom that of course wasn't just another copy of the Death Star, really...that was blown up in a MASSIVE series of accidents.  I guess we're supposed to believe that the Force had a sense of humor back before the Empire, huh? Let's also analyze some other significant problems.  The duel- Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan vs. Darth Maul.  Nice fight.  Too bad it didn't make a bit of sense. Qui-Gon Jinn is a full-fledged Jedi Knight.  Obi-Wan is an apprentice who is almost a full Jedi.  Darth Maul is an apprentice Sith.  It is extremely doubtful that an apprentice Sith with a dual-bladed SINGLE lightsaber can take a two-on-one fight with one full Jedi and another nearly full.  If the Sith are /that/ much better than the Jedi, then there's no way good ol' Luke could have ever beaten Vader- which he DID do, before the emperor interfered. Also, there's the matter of Qui-Gon's death.  I realize they pretty much had to have him eliminated from the story somehow, or Obi-Wan wouldn't have trained Anakin.  But being stabbed in an area that is not instantly fatal, with a weapon known to cauterize wounds (and that is made for slashing, not stabbing, and therefore would be awkward as a stabbing weapon), and slumping to the ground- somehow pulling Darth Maul's LASER sword, that cuts through much harder things than human flesh, down with him?  Anyone else see a problem?  Besides it being a far less visually stunning death than the rest of the fight seemed to be leading up to? Obi-Wan then proceeds, of course, to beat Darth Maul single-handedly, when the two Jedi couldn't even get a near-hit on the guy together.  Would it have been too hard to have Qui-Gon use the last of his strength to throw the lightsaber at Maul from behind or something cool like that, instead of having Obi-Wan get his power from anger (the dark side, by the way) and cut Maul in two with a slash twice as slow as the stuff the guy was blocking easily moments before? 'The Phantom Menace' is watchable, but only that.  It is certainly not a worthy prequel to the Star Wars Trilogy.  I will see the next movie...but only in the hopes that Lucas will fix what went wrong in this one.  And maybe take out Jar-Jar...",Null,0,1,8 March 2001
Speed," A great film
","Speed is amazing.  With stellar performances from the cast (something lacking in some action movies), a very nice plot (another thing lacking in many action movies), and excellent, suspenseful sequences, the entire film is a great experience.  This film is, actually, the only reason I later watched 'The Matrix,' which I originally believed would just be your standard sci-fi action flick.Remembering Keanu Reeves' performance in 'Speed,' however, made me take another look. Reeves is a good actor, who, in this film as well as in 'The Matrix,' did something many action stars can't do- he made me care about the characters far more than the stunts.  The addition of Sandra Bullock, an excellent actress, certainly didn't hurt things, nor did having Dennis Hopper as the diabodical villain (who is VERY convincing and nasty).Excellent film, with, by the way, an excellent soundtrack.  Check it out!",Null,0,0,3 March 2001
The Matrix," What is the Matrix? Well, one of the best films ever, for one thing...
","The Matrix...when I first heard about it, I expected just another sci-fi action thriller.  Good and filled with insane stunts, but not terribly intelligent.Boy, was I wrong.  Oh, the stunts are there in spades, all right, and yes, they are awesome.  And the special effects are absolutely amazing (even if similar ones have been used in other movies as a result- and not explained as well).But the movie has plot as well.  It has characters that I cared about.  From Keanu Reeves' excellent portrayal of Neo, the man trying to come to grips with his own identity, to Lawrence Fishburne's mysterious Morpheus, and even the creepy Agents, everyone does a stellar job of making their characters more than just the usual action 'hero that kicks butt' and 'cannon fodder' roles.  I cared about each and every one of the heroes, and hated the villains with a passion.  It has a plot, and it has a meaning...and lo and behold, a plot does help the fight scenes!  Just try it, if you haven't seen the movie before.  Watch one of the fight scenes.  Then watch the whole movie.  There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of the scenes- sure, they're great as standalones, but the whole thing put together is an experience unlike just about everything else that's come to the theaters.  Think about it next time you're watching one of the more brainless action flicks...think how much better it COULD be.All I can say is WATCH THIS MOVIE.  If you haven't, you're missing out on one of the best films of all time.  It isn't just special effects, folks.",Null,578,806,3 March 2001
