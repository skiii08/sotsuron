Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," 1/ f Perfect Film
","Marton Csokas, Rufus Sewell, Benjamin Walker, Anthony Mackie, Dominic Cooper, Jimmi Simpson, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead have careers of greatness ahead. I have a good imagination, but I couldn't figure out how anyone could get me to buy into this story idea. But I was completely immersed. My heart cheered throughout the show. I was amazed to receive 105 minutes of the food of life!Light defeats darkness. What a thrill. Joseph Mawle was also powerful in his role, but the truth is Lincoln's father abused him. Reality is more complex, and Lincoln's father is the one who made Lincoln know the pain of feeling enslaved.Robin McLeavy was perfect as Lincoln's mother, who embodied goodness and light, for a great slingshot to drive the action of this film.Bekmambetov brought out superb performances. Film is extraordinary and memorable. I want to see it again and again. Plot is tight, and delivers advanced comprehension in human relationships. Love was never more exquisitely and delightfully throbbing in heart, soul, body, and mind. Give me excess of it.For TRUTH marching on try: http://statesmansword.blogspot.com/2012/05/assassination-of-abraham- lincoln.html",10,7,13,22 June 2012
