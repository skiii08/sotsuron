Minority Report," Majority rules on `Minority Report'
","So, the third of the four must-sees this summer movie season is out (Spider-Man, Attack of the Clones, this, Men In Black II) and I saw it last night.  With all the buzz about this flick being Steven Speilberg's best movie since Raiders of the Lost Ark, I felt as if I should've been standing in line on opening night.  I mean, that's pretty tall talk to be better than Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List.  Truth be told, I was almost willing to pay the $7.50 just to see the Daredevil and Red Dragon trailers. As for the main feature, the verdict is good.  Yes, I said `good.'  Well, I'll even go so far as to say `pretty darn good,' but certainly not `Speilberg's best since 'Raiders'.'  Just `pretty darn good.'
The premise is by now well known: Washington, D.C. in the year 2054 has an experimental program in which murders are foreseen by mutated precognitives and potential perpetrators are arrested before their crime can be committed. The constitutional arguments are also pretty well known by now, but I don't have any intention of getting into a monologue about that, as the issue is covered in the movie and it's the movie I'm here to discuss.  Tom Cruise's policeman John Anderton is the chief of the `Precrime' department of the D.C. Police, and has a zeal for the program stemming from the disappearance of his 6-year old son in the days before the Precrime program.  When a representative of the Justice Dept. arrives to try to poke holes in the program's premise before the it's instituted nationally, Anderton is told by his boss, played by Max Von Sydow, to accommodate him.  The next thing we know, the `precogs' foresee Anderton committing a murder in less then three days' time, and the chase is on . . .Cruise once again displays his mastery of the `cold' acting method.  As he did to perfection in `Jerry Maguire' and `Born on the Fourth of July' (but for some strange reason abandoned in `Vanilla Sky'), he relates his character's anguish, anxiety, terror, etc., through subtle stares, sparse dialogue and body language.  No ranting and raving, no overly preachy stretches of dialogue; just a look in the right place here and a sentence under the breath there, and the audience gets the idea.  Staring at and speaking in unison with home-movie holograms and hobbling about his home strung out on inhaled illegal drugs, Anderton displays to us his personal misery, then returns to dedicated professionalism at the station-house the next day.  He does a fine job of carrying this movie.  Colin Farrell (who will play Bullseye in Daredevil next year) does a great job as the Justice Dept. errand-boy, playing him with just the right amount of swarminess (is that a word?) and intelligence.  Von Sydow's performance is terrific as well, and his role here continues the summer's theme of taking `senior' movie veterans and making wonderful use of them (Cliff Robertson in Spider-Man, Christopher Lee in Attack of the Clones).The visuals here are terrific.  The vision of Washington, D.C. 52 years from now is more believable than Blade Runner's prediction for Los Angeles of 2016.  The architecture and technology are not so omnipresent in the Capitol that we don't see life as we might would lead it.  With the exception of the superhighways, the technology depicted in the movie is a garnish to life at that time.  The bluish tint that Spielberg gives the film casts an almost sterile hue to the world we see there, such that blood, when spilled, is all the more garish to see.  I thought it was an interesting touch.  The sick-sticks and retina-scanning spider-robot bloodhounds used by law enforcement of the day were absolutely creepy.  The personalized advertisements and greetings depicted here instantly made me think of the crap accumulating in my e-mail box every day (lasmoak, give your lover a larger . . . or lasmoak, mortgage rates are now . . .), and this hitting-me-close-to-home gave a lot of other things in the movie credibility.  This movie shows us a world where fantasies can be lived out in a chamber is a lot closer than the holodecks of Star Trek.Okay, the story.  It's good.  Yes, I even said it was pretty good.  This film isn't a big-budget, slam-bang modern American Action Movie, and with good reason:  It isn't supposed to be.  It is big-budget, don't get me wrong, and it's all on the screen.  The visuals and the effects are terrific, and they enhance, not overpower, the plot.  This movie is a lot more cerebral than I expected, and that's always a welcome surprise in today's movies.  I confess that I wasn't prepared for the film-noir pace of the movie, as hearing all this comparison to `Raiders' had me set for a trill-a-minute-type spectacle.  Well, it ain't that, but it's good nonetheless.  Yes, the movie's 2 hours and 20 minutes, but I promise you that it doesn't feel like it.  Speilberg once again tells us a marvelous story, this one being expanded from a short story by Philip K. Dick, the author behind the works inspiring Blade Runner and Total Recall.  The clues unfold, the suspects sometimes surprise us and the confrontation at the end is not one easily predicted, despite it having been foreseen by the precogs (figure that one out for yourself).This is one to see, and while it ain't Raiders, it sure as heck beats Scooby-Doo.",6,0,0,25 August 2002
The Bourne Identity," Not too shabby...
","Not too long ago, when reviewing The Sum of All Fears, I wrote of what we all experience at one time or another when seeing a film based on a book we've read.  As I was leaving the house, and driving across the river and entering the theater to see The Bourne Identity, I was having that quandary once again.  I'd read the Robert Ludlum novel almost fifteen years ago, and I recently re-read it, just to make things even more difficult for myself (I suppose I'm a glutton for punishment).  I'd liked the story.  I'd even kinda-sorta liked the Richard Chamberlain-Jaclyn Smith TV movie version in 1988.  The novel was a little melodramatic in parts, but on the whole, it was an intelligent, involving action story that incorporated techno-gadget spy-toys of the day (late 1970s) in a realistic fashion.  Moving that story forward twenty years while staying true to the source material would be a chal-lenge.I'll come back to that point shortly, but I also wanted to touch on some of the Develop-mental Hell this film went through in order to make it to the screen, and how all of that affected the finished product.  Those who follow the movie `business' know that this film was shot in late 2000 and early 2001, and meant to be released in the fall of 2001, but 9/11 pushed that back.  Then, after test audience results came back unfavorably, cast and crew were recalled to European locations to shoot a new ending in January of 2002, and the release date was pushed back even further.  It is something of a truism that when such things happen, the movie is almost beyond saving and will probably stink.Oh, the story.  Man is pulled from the Mediterranean Sea, his body riddled with bullets, a microchip surgically implanted in his hip, and no memory of anything that happened before he was fished from the sea.  The microchip leads him to a bank in Zurich, where the first clues to his identity are revealed, and the more the man learns, the less he likes what it appears he is.  Picking up an unwitting accomplice in Zurich, in the form of a young woman who gives the man a ride to Paris, he ends up implicating her in whatever troubles his past self may have created, and relying on her to aid him.All that being said, The Bourne Identity, did the one thing that a film can do to avoid the novel/screenplay conflict:  it threw out the book, or at least most of it.  And considering the Hell that director Doug Liman and Universal Studios put each other through, the finished product is a well-made, entertaining and fairly believable action thriller.  Director Liman is known for his first two features, independently produced Swingers and Go, neither or which, unfortunately, I have seen.  This picture was his major-studio debut, and his reputation as a visually and structurally innovative filmmaker gave me hopes of something stylish and gritty, maybe like Michael Mann's work.  My guess turned out to be correct.The European locations -- Marseilles, Zurich, Paris, the French countryside -- are not shown in their travelogue-esque glitz and glamour.  It's winter; it's snowing and overcast most of the time, adding to the gloom of the title character's situation.  Liman's camera work does not disappoint, and Matt Damon delivers a top-notch performance that will add `action star' to his resume' of credentials.  The `romance' between Damon's character and his slightly-unwilling companion, played by German actress Franka Potente, is well-handled by the screenplay.  There's no roll in the hay for the sake of a love scene here; the film demon-strates how these two people, both cut off from their pasts in manners of speaking, seek comfort from their fear and learn to trust one another.  The action sequences are not the type seen in your average `bullets and profanity' pictures; they aren't gratuitous and, with one exception at the end (yes, in that re-shot, new ending), they're realistic.Of course, there were three Bourne novels written by Robert Ludlum, and Doug Liman has previously stated that he can envision shooting all three as a trilogy of films starring the Jason Bourne character.  I, for one, cannot see how that can be done, being how the first novel was all but ignored for the making of this film.  But, the James Bond franchise continues to this day, some twenty-five years after the producers of those films abandoned the source material.  Maybe Liman and Universal will surprise us.  However, for this summer, this film is worth your money, especially if you like your action stars not wearing tights or swinging laser-swords.",8,0,1,25 August 2002
Legends of the Fall," `Legends of the Fall' revisited
","In the autumn of 1994, I saw Legends of the Fall on its original theatrical run.  I looked forward to this film for two reasons: Edward Zwick, the director of Glory, and Anthony Hopkins, whom I am yet to see give a bad performance in anything (and given his volume of work, that's saying something).  I drove 45 miles to a `decent' movie theater, as I did for most all movies in those days, as my local theater was only worthy of bad porn. I sat in the dark and marveled at the panoramas of the Montana countryside. I fell a little in love with beautiful Julia Ormond, who sadly has all but vanished from the American movie scene.  I braced myself for what I was sure was going to be one of the best films of that year.  And then I left the theater greatly disappointed.Why, you ask?  Because the hero and central focus of the movie, Brad Pitt's Tristan, is a JERK!!  A completely spoiled rotten, irresponsible, unethical, self-centered JERK!!  Have I made it clear enough that he was an utter and total JERK!!??  I hope that I have.  Allow me to explain.Hopkins portrays a grizzled old veteran of the Indian Wars of the 1870s, bitter at the Indian policy his government ordered him to enforce.  He ranches cattle now, a few years shy of World War I, and has three sons on this ranch, along with several Native American hangers-on.  His wife has long left him, but his youngest and oldest sons have their mother's disposition.  Only the middle son, Pitt's Tristan, is his father's child. After the youngest child, played by E.T.'s Henry Thomas, brings a European fiancee' (Ormond) home, he leaves for the war in Europe, where he promptly dies.  This leaves the other two brothers to fight for their dead brother's fiancee's hand.  Got it?I had thought that now, eight years later, I might would see this film again and find something I had missed the first time and see it in a new light. After a Braves game one night, insomnia sets in, so I spent an evening staring at TBS Superstation's presentation of the picture, hacked up with commercials as Ted Turner is wont to do.  Alas, my take on this flick hasn't changed.  Just as I remembered, almost all of the parts here are wonderful, except for one very essential property: a worthwhile hero.  It's not that the movie is horrible, because it has several good things going for it. The locations are lushly photographed, the costumes and sets are perfectly detailed, and all of the performances are terrific, even Pitt's.  Here's an example of how one can assemble the perfect cast, the perfect director and the perfect crew in the perfect setting and begin to make a can't-miss film, only to end up with something less than perfect.  It is not the performance of Pitt's  character that lessens this film; it is the character itself.
Legends of the Fall has the feel of a grand American Epic, in the fashion of Red River and The Big Country.  The story winds through the years after World War I and the Prohibition era, with the characters aging and changing as they advance in years and alter their outlook on the world.  In that sense, it is an epic.  However, in the course of the epic events happening in these characters' world, we're presented a case study of a family that is dysfunctional in epic proportions, and the obvious hero of the entire story is so self-centered, immature and asinine in his choices and behavior that I can feel no sympathy for him, only for the folks whom his choices affect, often disastrously so.Leaving a woman who loves him alone with HIS family for years while he wanders the Earth in `search of himself' (and not even having the decency to drop her off in Europe with HER family while he's headed that way) is just one of numerous instances where this odd son puts those closest to him through absolute Hell.  I'm reluctant to go into much more detail, because as I much as I may loathe this particular character, he is the protagonist of the film and describing his actions in detail would give away too much of the story.  But shouldn't a protagonist be likable, or least bearable?  It must suffice to say that while I understand a tragic figure can make for good drama, a stupid one just makes for a tragically wasted film.",Null,2,4,26 August 2002
Signs," What a ride...
","Whew.  That's the first sound out of my mouth at the end of Signs, the newest film from director M. Night Shamaylan, the man behind The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable.  I expected spooky, creepy, jumpy, and I pretty much got all three, but not exactly in the way I expected, and I suppose that was Shamaylan's intention.  We've all seen the ad campaign for this movie, crop circles and what that may portend, but I'm pleased to say that the ad campaign has not given away too much of this movie, and in today's movie marketing, that's a very unusual feat.  I'm also very glad that even despite reading a couple of other reviews for this film before going, I don't feel as though anything was given away (well, nothing of significance, anyway).Mel Gibson, despite not even being visible on the movie's poster, is the star of the show.  He's a fallen Episcopalian priest, having lost his faith after the seemingly pointless death of his wife, leaving him alone with his two children and his brother, a failed minor league baseball player, played by Joaquin Phoenix.  He awakens one morning in his very empty-feeling house to the sound of his children screaming outside in his cornfields.  Rushing outside, he finds some of the crops depressed into an eerie pattern, a `Crop Circle' phenomenon that, as it turns out, is being repeated at various spots all over the globe.  What could it mean?  Is it some globe-spanning hoax? Are the E.T.'s finally about to invade?  Does it all really matter in the end?This picture has a pace and a mood that is unlike anything any other filmmaker is utilizing these days.  Shamaylan is an original, and in my opinion has yet to make a film that belies that label.  He can take premises that, on the surface, most moviegoers would write off as lighter fare and treat them with a weight that demands serious consideration on the part of his audience.  After all, ghost stories and comic-book super-abilities? Who would pay to see such movies?  Somebody sure has, since more than $400 million of combined box office can't be wrong.Shamaylan's use of comic moments is ingenious, using just enough of them and spacing them out just enough to put us at ease before something else jumps out and goes `boo.'  His use of silence is wonderful in conveying anticipation, which is often more frightening that what we end up seeing. The music in the film is sparse, primarily used in transition from one scene to another, leaving the sounds from the cornfields and the bumps in the night and the looks on his actors' faces to convey the tension of each scene.  I won't say this movie is Hitchcock-like, because Hitch never delved into the subject matter Shamaylan does routinely, but the effect is similar.
We don't see much of what it is we're supposed to be afraid of in this film, and that's part of what makes this film so effective.  With all of the time and emotion these characters have to anticipate what it is they fear, we learn what it is that makes them respond the way they do and what issues they have to resolve.  Even when we do see what we're supposed to be dreading so, we don't see it/them all that well as it/they remain/s almost ethereal.  There are so many idiosyncratic and seemingly ridiculous plot points that, in the end, all come together in an almost laughable logic that I kicked myself afterwards for not seeing it sooner.Of course, Shamaylan had help in this wonderful work in the part of his cast.  Gibson's tortured Graham Hess is likely his best pure acting job since Braveheart, but in a completely different way.  Gibson displays a quiet intensity I don't believe I've seen from him before.  This fallen man of God, claiming to have lost his faith, has probably not lost it so much as he just hasn't dealt with being angry with God for the first time.  He tells his brother at one point that if the events unfolding around them indicate the end of the world, no higher power will be at hand to help them.  Even when his brother tells him that he needs to curse and sound like he means it, Graham finds it difficult, and even is laughable in trying.  The two young actors playing Graham's children are wonderful, displaying an off-center emotional state one could believe coming from those six months removed from their mother's death.  The director himself even has a small but key role, and his one big scene is very gripping (but I certainly can't tell why).I wonder how Shamaylan would fare if he were to use his obvious talents in other genres, such as a slapstick comedy or a lush romance or a grand historical epic.  He has obviously mastered the spooky, creepy, jump-in-your-seat genre, so why not try something else?  But then again, why should he bother?  After all, nobody ever asked Hitchcock to do a slapstick comedy, either.",Null,1,1,25 August 2002
The Thin Red Line," What a slap in the face...
","Why must filmmakers of the last twenty-five years paint the fighting soldier, particularly the American fighting soldier, using a angst-filled, vile, butchering brush?  Did the home front experience of the Vietnam War so scar these men that now make movies about those who actually went over there and did the fighting?  The argument as to whether the Vietnam War was a just war is for another time and place, but in attempting to broaden that argument to cover all war in general, director Terence Malick has committed something akin to blasphemy in The Thin Red Line.  By choosing to move such metaphysical musings to the heads of the soldiers fighting the World War II battle for Guadalcanal in the Pacific, he has distorted history, insulted veterans and completely misrepresented the values and beliefs of the American GI's who fought that crucial battle. Malick doesn't deserve all the blame, I suppose, as this film is based on James Jones' somewhat autobiographical novel from the early 1960s, a time when all of the free-love, no-man-is-right-over-another philosophy was beginning to gel amongst the intelligentsia of the world's youth.  The book may be fantastic, but I can't say as I haven't had the pleasure of reading it.  Whatever the quality of the source material, however, Malick has taken it and made a complete and utter mess of it.  Sure, this film was his celebrated return to filmmaking after a twenty-year absence, and it received a Best Picture Oscar nomination, most likely just due to the awe in which Academy voters hold Malick.  But this wasn't worth the wait.
The plot (such as it is) follows four men, I think, as they struggle with finding meaning in the carnage of the Pacific War against the Japanese.  I say that I think it was four men because two of them, played by Jim Caviezel and Ben Chaplin, look so remarkably alike that at times I couldn't tell them apart.  One (Caviezel) plays the part of the Conscientious Objector, a chronic deserter who, after being picked up by the Army while living amongst island natives, is assigned to stretcher-bearer duty at the film's outset. By the end of the film, Malick shows the character's selfishness to be misplaced, but for certainly less-than-patriotic reasons.  Another (Chaplin) is the one who was taken away from his young bride, and lives only to return to her.  Again, Malick shows us the foolishness of such devotion by the film's end. The other two are thankfully a bit more discernible from one another.  Sean Penn is a company sergeant who makes it his mission to show Caviezel's character the error of his ways, but by film's end, he finds more sympathy with the deserter than he would've imagined possible.  Lastly is the battalion colonel (Nick Nolte), who drives his men relentlessly to take a well-defended Japanese position, one that his underlings believe impossible to take.  While Malick shows the Colonel to be right, we're to understand that it is more for the colonel's fear of missing out on his share of military glory than for the higher cause of victory, because he flat-out tells his subordinates so!  How ridiculous a notion.  Other characters drift in and out of our vision, played by A-list stars like Woody Harrelson and John Travolta and John Savage, mumbling about vines consuming trees and soldiers being like children to their Captain-fathers, none of whom ever make any mark with us save as examples of the Hell of War. Their voice-overs almost overlap, allowing us to eavesdrop on their confusion, their fear and their cowardice. The imagery of this movie is breathtaking.  Don't let it be said that I didn't acknowledge that.  Malick has not lost his visual touch during his extended vacation, but he has obviously not advanced beyond his mid-70s thinking.  Whatever things the Vietnam War may have been, World War II was almost none of them.  That war was a just war, and the soldiers fighting it knew it.  American men were lining up in droves to volunteer to go and crush an evil power that had attacked us and swore to destroy us, and only a microscopic few had any problems with self-doubt or introspection about `why nature must contend with itself' or finding the `evil inherent in all men' that the wretched souls in this film have.  I shudder to think of what my veteran grandfather, God rest his soul, would've said about these pansies.The film is so without a logical structure that I suppose it's possible Malick himself didn't know exactly what he wanted to say.  He worked on this material so long that he might have simply drifted away from the novel's original intent.  I doubt this, though.  Say what you want about the politics of filmmakers, their skill is rarely debatable, and filmmakers of Malick's caliber put on the screen exactly what they intend.  It's just so puzzling and disappointing that what he intended here was such a slap in the face to so noble a struggle.",5,2,4,21 April 2004
