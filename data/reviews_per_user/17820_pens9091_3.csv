The Ring," The Sixth Sense without much common sense
","++ SPOILERS ++So let me see if I've got this straight .... child is created with strange chemicals. Nasty child is abused by parents. Placed in barn with horses, can't sleep 'because they keep her awake' - what do they do, play cards all night? throw wild parties? they're horses for heaven's sake! Evil child kills horses. Child placed in well to die.Now, here's where it just leaps off the page: to exact her revenge, evil child makes an evil VIDEO TAPE! Ha ah! Scared you, didn't it! Not hauntings, not body possessions - a tape! Perhaps in time she'll master the art of DVD burning? And what is the point of this evil tape? To kill people as she was killed. Okayyyyyy. But traditionally, an angry spirit wants those who were responsible for harming it to be killed - not complete and innocent strangers! What's up with that? And when the clues on the tape are deciphered and the body is recovered, is the vengence over? Nope. So what's the point? Kill everyone on the planet? Good call.The kid in the movie was cheap knock off of the boy from The Sixth Sense, all spooky silent walking and big eyes. And the mom looked like one of those sitcom aunts that suddenly has to take care of a kid that wasn't hers. Wackiness ensues. And how does someone find a lighthouse so quickly from a blurry video frame? Dang, she must be a better researcher than people give her credit for.Creepy images and tons of atmosphere but the movie didn't do anything for me. I prefer movies with resolution not supernatural 'gotchas' that never end. The movie has further solidified my opinion that all movie children are evil.",5,1,2,11 January 2004
Lost in Translation," Lost ... her pants?
","I thought the movie was touching and sad, wistful and romantic and bittersweet. What no one seems to have mentioned before is how Charlotte can't seem to keep her pants on! She has a better than 50/50 chance of being in her underwear every time you see her! Why?!?!If you haven't see the movie yet I don't know what I or anyone else could say to make you want to see it. It was a beautiful slice in time between two people drowning in their own lives as well as a different culture. Give it a chance.",8,0,1,4 April 2004
From Hell," Could have been much better
","I rented this movie for Halloween as I was looking for something with a horror feel to it. Some parts of this movie lived up to that but I'm glad I had my remote to fast-forward through some of the slower parts. I especially liked the stylized shooting of the first murder - the flashes of the knife in the night. Very striking!What I did not like was what nearly everyone else mentioned: 1) Heather Graham - that red hair - sheesh! Even my dye jobs don't look that bad! And don't get me started on the accents - ech! And how nice that her character seems to be the only streetwalker who doesn't actually sleep with anyone? (a la 'Pretty Woman') 2) Johnny Depp's laudanum chugging 'visionary' detective work - please. Who'd listen to a druggy cop in any era?I did enjoy the commendable attention to detail to the Londoners and the background scenery. I could get into the feel of turn of the century London life the longer I watched the movie. Some scenes were humorous - like poor people having to sleep sitting up (and tied up) instead of sleeping in beds. Side note - the women couldn't find enough money to pay the gang but they found enough to bury their friend? Unlikely.The photography is what makes this film worth watching. The brilliant orange colored skies, the dark and forbidding streets ...  I'll definitely check out the graphic novel this was based on.6/10",6,1,2,2 November 2002
