The Ring," Greatest horror movie released in a long time.
","Ladies and gentlemen, we have ourselves a horror movie. After watching The Ring I have just witnessed one of the most unique and best horror movies ever released. There isn't really anything bad about this film at all. It has every ingredient to provide chills, scares, and a great 2 hours of your time.First of all, I think The Ring had some excellent characters that brought the whole story together. I really liked the character of Rachel, mainly becuase of her persuasive and determined attitude through the film. Her son, I didn't care for becuase he seemed to be a rip off of Haley Joel Osmont's character in The Sixth Sense. Rachel's ex-husband Noah was a very captivating character and I could feel myself rooting for him throughout the film. Rachel and Noah had great chemistry.The story is extremely complicated, but once you figure it out, you see exactly how great and creative it is. The story is basically this. There is a video tape in which after you watch, you have exactly 7 days to live. Rachel's niece caught a viewing of the tape, and a week later she died. This gets Rachel's investigation going. After she views the tape, and gets her little phone call of her demise in a week, she goes to find things out before her time comes. That is all I can reveal without spoiling things in the movie. This film is very captivating and I know it had my attention throughout.The best thing about this film is the actual suspense and fear factor enclosed in it. There is a scene at the end which I can easily say is on of the most freakiest and scariest moments in horror film history. The whole film basically builds up to this and I have to say they did a hell of a job pulling this scene off. You will know exactly what I'm talking about once you see it. It will have you talking for days and days. You may even have nightmares as well. Also, the director really knows how to bring scares to the audience. Loud bangs, out of control animals, and grizley images of the little girl are some of the things that many people seemed to be scared of. The scares are evenly spread out through the movie adding surprise each time.Overall, I beleive the Ring is one of the best horror movies released in a very long time. I can't think of anything as unique and well made as this movie. I was captivated from the opening sequence to the credits. From an excellent plot, to a detective study of the tape, to one of the most terrifying scenes ever on screen, The Ring delivers. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone willing to to devote 2 hours of their time. It's one of the best horror movies ever released in my opinion. Watch The Ring and have fun!",9,0,0,21 October 2002
