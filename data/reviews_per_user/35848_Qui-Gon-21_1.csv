Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Excellent movie, did not disappoint, something for everyone.
","All the hype to this movie has made it virtually impossible for the movie to keep up with people's expectations so I entered the theatre with a fairly open mind.  As the film began it was clear straight away that the theme from the previous 3 movie's had remained - to everyone's delight. As the title to the film began to scroll I felt like a 7 year old again watching the original Star Wars movie.  The special effects in the movie are absolutely seamless, they integrate into the film without really being noticed which is what Lucas and his magicians would hope to achieve.  A lot of criticism has been leveled at too much use of special effects, but if that's what is required to tell a story - I think it should be used.  The main thread of the story is simple but it is entwined with other small stories which I think will become more apparent in the next two prequels, having said that - I think only the die hard Star Wars fans will pick up on some of hints in the smaller stories. The actors all played excellent parts - especially Jake Lloyd who gave a wonderful performance as the 'Young Anakin Skywalker'. All in all - you have to remember that these films are basically fairytales aimed at children but even the adults just can't help getting caught up in it all.  To finalise - ignore the critics (this is STAR WARS), bring on the next two.",10,0,0,27 July 1999
