The Ring," This is the scariest movie I have ever seen. Ever.
",This is the scariest movie that I have ever seen in my lifetime. This movie is a must-see for anybody who has ever watched a scary movie. I have seen hundreds of horror movies (literally) and this just might be the scariest one yet. I have rated this movie a ten because it is very scary and has a great plot. Also its not all gore and you have to think about it and there are many interpretations on what different things in the movie might mean. It had the perfect mix of scary moments and plot twists. Everything tied together so perfectly that whoever wrote the script is deserves much praise and awards. If you like scary movies and great plot twists watch The Ring.,10,0,0,20 October 2002
Resident Evil," The best zombie movie ever...period.
","This is the best zombie movie ever, and thats a tough thing to do, to beat out night, dawn, and day of the dead. This movie was more action than horror and they didn't have to use blood and gore to get good ratings, a sign of a truly great movie. If you play the games, or even if you dont, I advise you to go see this movie.",10,0,0,30 March 2002
