The King's Speech," A classic inspirational film!
","The King's Speech is an exceptional depiction of a man's struggle with a deeply entrenched imperfection, and his unrelenting perseverance to overcome it. This inspiring film is based on a true story, and truly captivates and empowers the audience. The theme of the movie is never fear the challenge of overcoming a limitation, no matter how debilitating, because a strong resolve can produce amazing results.Written by David Seidler and directed by Tom Hooper, this film articulates the true story of King George VI of England and his stuttering problem that appeared to be incapacitating. King George VI, with the assistance of his wife Elizabeth, seeks help in defeating this weakness through a local commoner, resulting in an amazing journey and unlikely friendship. The film contains a stellar cast including Colin Firth as the Duke of York and King George VI, Helena Bonham Carter as Elizabeth the wife of King George VI, and Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue the speech therapist. The supporting cast includes Guy Pearce as David the brother of King George VI and Michael Gambon as George V. The film begins with the first speech given by the Duke of York at the Empire Exhibition closing ceremony in Wembley London in 1925. He is visibly uneasy when preparing to give the speech and this anxiety is magnified by the confidence and preparation shown by the BBC announcer in the same sequence, who is broadcasting the speech. The atmosphere is very dreary, grim, dark, and cold, utilizing mainly black and blue colors from the clothing to the buildings. This color and lighting scheme conveys the depressing nature of his predicament, as well as the frustration and misery the Duke feels. The disappointing delivery of the Duke's speech is evident by his constant stammering and the discouraging look on his face, and the faces of the audience. Shortly after, the Duke and his wife are seen at a doctor's office receiving unsuccessful and maddening treatment for his speech impediment, by a physician with inaccurate knowledge of the causes and remedies for the condition. The Duke then reaches a breaking point in dealing with his impediment, expressing his unwillingness to seek any further therapy. His wife, Elizabeth, then obtains a referral to speech therapist Lionel Logue, who provides unorthodox and controversial, yet promising services, and hires him immediately. The film proceeds with the trials and triumphs of the Duke's wrestling with his disability publicly and privately, as well as the release of years of pain, frustration, and torment over it by himself and those closest to him. Despite the ridicule of his older brother David and the overbearing badgering of his father George V, the Duke continues to employ the services of Mr. Logue in his fight to conquer his speech impediment.After the death of George V, David is given the throne, but relinquishes it to marry the woman he desires. This pushes the Duke of York to the head of the country, forcing him to completely tackle his condition so that he may speak clearly to the people, reaching their hearts and giving a voice to their concerns. The Duke becomes King George VI, and after working with Mr. Logue incessantly and even through a brief tiff, finally cements his relationship with Mr. Logue, leading to his first major speech as King. The resilient determination shown by King George VI motivates and encourages all to not be governed by fear, but to embrace the voice each individual has. This message is similar to the plight of Temple Grandin, where she perseveres in her struggle with autism.The lighting, camera techniques, and music amplify the feeling and depth of the intense emotions displayed by the characters. The lighting was natural and subdued, providing a somber and melancholy atmosphere. The lighting was dim and side lighting and low-key lighting was used to produce shadows, creating suspense and mystery, adding to the dark mood of the film. There were numerous close-up shots on the characters to augment their sentiments and responses, allowing the audience to be drawn in and directly involved in the character's experience. This indirect-subjective point of view was utilized numerous times throughout the movie, especially on King George VI as he showed his difficulty giving speeches, increasing the intensity of the struggles portrayed. Deep focus was also used to show the constraint and restriction incurred by the disability of the King. In the elevator scenes going to Mr. Logue's office, the camera showed a very closed in and tight atmosphere, emphasizing discomfort and entrapment. High-angle shots were also used to emphasize the despair and distress of the characters. The extremely high camera angle over Mr. Logue, as he walks down the long corridor of the church during the set-up for the King's coronation ceremony, effectively details his anxiety over the result of the conversation he sees taking place. Finally the music enlarged the already intense moments and emotions conveyed in the film, and generated even more power and passion in the film. The musical score communicated frustration, dismay, pain, and satisfaction, and worked alongside the emotions being shown on the screen. For instance, the symphonic music played drowning out the book reading of King George VI in Mr. Logue's office expressed frustration, mystery, curiosity and weariness. All of the elements contributed greatly to the visual impact of the film.The King's Speech is a fascinating story about desperation, vulnerability, and accomplishment. The film proves that individuals can prevail over disappointment and limitations of any kind, and any efforts made to stamp out our fears are well worth it.",10,0,1,3 November 2013
