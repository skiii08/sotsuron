The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Great movie
","If you like the previous movies you will probably like this. But if you did'nt like the others then why even bother seeing this and argue about it being bad and so on???? Don't get that. I never se a move that I know i don't like, why should I??Now over to the movie. I found it very good and I will definitely see it again. A little more predictable than the first three but for being the fourth movie in in a series, it was very good.So my recommendation: 1 - If you like twilight, go see it. 2 - If you don't like Twilight, go see something else. 3 - If you have never seen twilight before, see the other three first and then follow step 1 or 2.",10,16,48,17 November 2011
