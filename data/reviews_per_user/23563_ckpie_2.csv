Hereditary," Rubbish. As far from a masterpiece as possible.
","Probably the worst movie-going experience of 2018 for me and I pretty much see all the releases week to week.....yes.....even worse than Fifty Shades of Nothing. Even that was more terrifying.The first 40% of the film is dedicated to showing nothing in particular, backed by a horror genre standard screechy, whiny score that tries to inject some tension into the film's bland characters doing absolutely nothing. The problem with this movie for me is that it spends over two hours telling a story that goes nowhere, character arcs that develop nowhere and ultimately throwing in a mystical twist that borders on ridiculous. Performances were over the top, comically overdone especially Toni Collett and Alex Wolff. Put it this way, if you are a God fearing Christian and even the mere mention of the devil will send you sprinting for the confession box, then this movie will probably terrify you. For the rest of us, if 40 minutes of nothing followed by the mention of a 'seance' then characters sitting at tables reacting to moving cups sounds as bad, Hereditary manages to be even worse.",3,12,29,11 June 2018
The Dark Knight," BEST superhero film ever made? VERY likely.
","The Dark Knight, superb in every aspect, surpassing its predecessor; Batman Begins in every way possible.Pulling in the audience with an excellent cast, starting with Christian Bale; as the charismatic Bruce Wayne. His performance in this film was more deep than that of Begins, and Bale really delves into the character, distinguishing his separate personalities and the troubles that come with it.Aaron Eckhart, Gary Oldman, Maggie Glyllenhal and Morgan Freeman work together to provide a very solid foundation for the true star of the show; Heath Legder.Ledger ends his career(sadly) with a blast out performance as the joker, a psychotic, evil and 'smart' Batman nemesis. A truly memorable job, he steals every scene he's in, leaving the audience stunned, amazed, frightened, so captivating that he seems to be a constant presence within the film, as we are still thinking of him even after he has left the screen.TDK's soundtrack is also to be commended. Subtle enough to not dominate the film, yet powerful enough to leave a lasting impression on the audience and also to complement all characters and settings, further enhancing the dark mood and atmosphere of Gotham City and its inhabitants.Finally, the real hero of The Dark Knight, Chris Nolan must be mentioned. From all his films, especially Momento, he has proved to be an exceptional director. He shows his skills once again, nailing Batman's theme and atmosphere with his perfect direction. Combining the well-done script and cinematography, he creates a work of art, a masterpiece.10/10. The Dark Knight is flawless in every way, creating the very possible, best superhero film of all time. It may be a batman movie, but yet it is so much more than that. Multiple viewings highly recommended, as it is packed with so many things that one cannot fully appreciate them all without seeing it more than once.",10,7,16,12 August 2008
