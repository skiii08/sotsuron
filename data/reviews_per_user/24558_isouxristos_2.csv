Avengers: Infinity War," The greatest movie in mcu
","The russo brothers have made a fantastic movie with successful humor, with nice fight scenes and this scene with thor arriving in wakanda with his new hammer,killing many of the thanos army and after a few seconds he said 'bring me thanos' this scene was forgiving and the best hero entrance in mcu.Excuse me for my awful English but I'm from Cyprus and don't know good English
Thanks!!!",10,1,2,15 October 2019
