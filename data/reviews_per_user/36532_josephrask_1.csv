Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Simply Amazing
","I laughed until it hurt, I wanted the pain to stop, but I kept laughing. I can't wait to see the film again when it opens in November. I'm keeping this spoiler free. Fans of the show will be very pleased with the movie. It stays true to the character we've come to love over the years. However you don't need to be a fan of the show to enjoy this movie. The presentation is such that you can just jump right in to the character and enjoy it, but knowing the character first does enhance the experience.No movie in recent memory has been filled with so many non stop laughs. People worried about a repeat of the somewhat disappointing Ali G film need not worry. To some people this movie could be extremely offensive, they didn't pull any punches, this is the same balls to the wall character Borat has always been. Hopefully there won't be any further edits to the film before it see's national release. I'll definitely be seeing the film again, possibly several times, and I can't wait for the DVD release.",10,6,29,21 September 2006
