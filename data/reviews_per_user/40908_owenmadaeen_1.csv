The Lobster," Boring, Absurd and not funny.
","Basically the title, the good reviews have a point. it does have something to say about trying to fit in, about rebels being as extreme as authority, about the extremes and the open ending.but to be quite honest this is really more of a consolation for watching the movie than anything. the 2 hours of this movie were boring, dull and not funny. the movie is interesting but certainly not recommended, and is not worth the time.",2,2,3,13 January 2019
