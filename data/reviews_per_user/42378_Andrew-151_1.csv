The Blair Witch Project," Take my advice and wait for the video release
","I know, I know, most of you feel this is the scariest movie of all time. The only scary thing about this movie was the fact that it cost $9.50 to see it.  Everyone who claims this is a masterpiece in horror needs to understand that their desperation to see a good horror movie has blinded their thought to think this was scary.  We have been deprived of scary movies for too long and we are too eager to jump on the Blair Witch to get a quick fix.Hey, don't get me wrong, this movie was brilliant, but not scary.  I applaud Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez for creating an original and unique movie with such a limited budget and cast.  They have proven that you don't need a billion dollars to make a good movie that makes a ton of money. If I were to compare the Haunting(newly released) and the Blair witch Project, I would have to say that the Blair Witch supersedes the Haunting in both its ability to scare and the entertainment factor.  However, they are both two movies you don't want to waste your hard earned money on.The Blair Witch was astounding in originality, the acting was great and believable, and the filming was superb except for the times when I got a headache trying to focus on a jumping screen.  However, and this is a big however, they forgot to put in the scary parts.  The story was great, but they forgot to put in the scary parts.  I know they tried to add horror to this film but their attempts were feeble.  This film could of been the classic everyone is talking about if they shot a little more film and realized they were shooting a horror film not a documentary",Null,2,3,2 August 1999
