The Blair Witch Project," Nice concept , crappy performance.
","Before i start, i should tell you that i have no problem watching low budget, independent films as long as they're watchable.I consider myself a fan of horror films of all kinds.Having heard what i've heard about that movie i was expecting a film without the need of sound effects, jump scares, and cheap cgi creatures to achieve what a horror film should achieve.I was not wrong, but along with sound effects, jump scares and the cgi, the movie also lacked suspense, interest about the characters and even the existence of an actual witch.Half way through the film you won't get to see anything but 3 students camping in the woods filming strange things to find in the woods like leaves, trees and aligned rocks.Having not seen anything close to a witch at the first 50 minutes, you expect the crew to run into one every time they hear noises out of their tent and run after them. But no, they only find more leaves and sticks.Finally, 5 minutes before the end of the movie, the gang (a smaller one, as the hippie one has gone missing) finds a cabin in the woods and goes in. There, after screaming and running the gang gets trapped by the witch (nope, you don't get to see her) and the film ends.Conclusion: no, nope, non, niet, yok, οχι. do NOT see that movie.",1,1,2,22 November 2014
Divergent," Hollywood perfected the teenmoneymaking formula.
","To begin with, the movie was horrible as we all expected.The thing is, that horrible movie made some serious money and proved that there is no need for new ideas and good writing for a movie to achieve that kind of gross.Why invest time and effort on a better movie when we can just modify our target audience expectations? That's why every now and then a new Mtv-like teen actor who's interviews are like audiobooks of what their managers has given them to read pops up into the movie business.The formula is now known. A teen next door who is just so random and socially awkward and can't stand mainsteam fashions and activities is globally cherished as other teens crave for someone to relate to.However, that's not a new thing. In fact it's the same thing that macho men and dynamic women represented in the 90s as well as the 80s. The thing is that those actors, because of their Hollywood persona, actually had a personality. Now teen actors have nothing that would differentiate them from one another except their face. They are just mirrors for teens to put themselves on as they have no characteristic that would not match with any of their own.That's why we end with such talentless and without personality actors, and a script that supports such characters:'A common teen like any other (THAT COULD BE YOU!) finds him/herself in a situation of him/her being different of their peers(OMG THAT'S LIKE TOTALLY HOW I FEEL!) and achieve greatness being a non conformist in a world full of conformists.' sounds familiar?Please stop paying for such movies. Make them try harder.",1,4,7,18 April 2015
