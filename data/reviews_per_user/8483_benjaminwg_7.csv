First Man," Pretty good. Regardless of the execution, it tries to know and humanize a private man.
","Some of the family scenes felt a little too much like a Terrence Malick movie. Arguably the family stuff and the wife (the proverbial woman behind the man) are given too much screen time in general for a movie about space travel. These were professionals that compartmentalize in order to focus. I can sort of see the filmmakers' viewpoint that the family knew some aspects of him more than maybe his colleagues, particularly for someone this private, and since he's the protagonist here that should be a primary source, but it feels forced and weird.I liked how they did more POVs & close-ups in the craft and from within the craft and fewer gods-eye-views. That's a big pet peeve of mine of lamely providing prospectives no one had and they did it well here; also makes it more suitably claustrophobic and violent.I didn't like how brooding they made Armstrong and how Aldrin almost seemed to have a social disorder. The former was more smiley and affable in footage I've seen though he was clearly shy and not the most comfortable in the spotlight, and Aldrin's personality seems exaggerated here to act as an obvious character contrast.Liked the dangerous, uncertain, mysterious, spooky tone it had compared to the boys choir romanticized shlock of Apollo 13. Might improve rewatchability if you can get past the morose Armstrong and excessive focus on family. The film's overall somberness does sort of lend itself I guess to the being-close-to-certain-death aspect that permeates it, like hanging out in an ER for a night.Launch times still too short and still not fully showing trajectory, but are more accurate in this than prior movies like showing vibrating eyeballs. The Gemini 8 scene has a little homage early to the film Contact, which also brought to mind some similarities elsewhere in First Man to Interstellar. The Gemini 8 boarding and launch scene alone will probably get this nominated for Best Sound this year.I would have liked to see some of the living, shaving, pooping, whatever everyday annoying stuff of life in a tin can for a couple days on transit to the moon... constant mind-numbing checklists, cleaning sweat off stuff, complaining about the smell, etc. They're just, boom, all the way to the moon and getting ready for landing. Could have also been an opportunity for the Armstrong and Aldrin thing to have more of an arc beyond just the awe-inspiring and hairy landing.",7,0,1,14 January 2019
Gravity," 'It's not rocket science' ... uhmmm, yeah it is, George.
","My complaints aren't just about Clooney's fuel usage, their inertia when going to the ISS, or Bullock's underwear. That's the obvious stuff. What's less obvious is there is little adherence to orbital mechanics in *any* of the film. You can't just point the re-entry vehicle at Earth. You'd have to fire your rockets to decelerate enough to begin losing altitude and so you're slow enough that the friction as you descend into thicker atmosphere safely continues to decelerate you using the heat shield. That is a BIG deal. The atmosphere is otherwise lethal to you, heat shield or not.Sure, stuff superficially moves basically o.k. and is kind of floaty and equal-but-opposite-reactiony, but most everything else is wrong. It's not just inertia here or a lack of anything pulling Clooney away from the structure there. The latter 'heroic disconnect scene' could have been fixed with just rotating the damaged station to give them centrifugal force. Gravity is a negligible effect, since they're already in orbit (i.e going real fast laterally and being high enough to be out of the thick atmosphere so they don't burn up). Rotation is easy enough to do with CGI elements, too, and logical since the ISS was just hit by debris. Just requires some expensive computer time at the FX house re-rendering that scene using the already-built 3D models and textures. In fact, you could leave all the principle scene elements as-is and just revolve the Earth around them in the background slowly. Bingo, stupid physics moment solved.That's unforgivable, but what's more unforgivable is the just point-and-fire-your-rocket view of orbital physics in getting from one place to another that occurs repeatedly! Even if miraculously all of those stations and the shuttle were nearby and visible with the naked eye, which is completely ludicrous unless they made some point of saying they'd all just rendezvoused recently for some long-planned joint venture with the Hubble telescope (hard even in real life), you'd still never be able to get there in a strait line. Orbital mechanics is all about change in velocity governing altitude and then arc rendezvous paths. If you magically had enough fuel and thrust, you'd have to change your velocity, change your orbital path, and loop around a few times until you meet-up with the other object. Otherwise, you'd end up in front of or behind the object depending on your altitude differential. And that's even if you're lucky enough to just so happen to be going in the same direction before you begin the maneuver, which is just about never.That's actually what's so dangerous and crazy about orbital mechanics: even in the unlikely event the ISS or Chinese space station could be seen and you had A LOT of leftover fuel after your stupid Abyss-opening-scene-like joyriding (yeehaw!), you wouldn't be able to reach it. That's pretty dramatic, in my opinion. The lack of air and the possibility of space junk causing you to explode into a mess of sparks aren't really the most interesting part of this orbital stuff, in my opinion. Everything is moving fast up there (otherwise you would fall back to Earth) and it takes a lot of energy to change the arrangement, let alone do that in a way that matches with the path of anything else, let alone actually meet-up with it.There are people making the argument that you can't have a dramatic and captivating movie where all this is accurately portrayed. What about Das Boot, Alive, Men of Honor, K2, Pressure, Everest? They all tried to be realistic about other dangerous environments that cut you off from civilization and safety. I realize the Martian tried this, but that's more obvious, too. He's on another planet. What about the bizarreness of being right there, visible to someone with a telescope, and there's nothing anyone can do to save you? That interests me. I don't think you have to severely compromise physics to have drama and keep people in the seats, rather in the case of an orbital emergency film, the physics is where much the danger comes from.",5,0,0,8 November 2015
Dark City," A near masterpiece, with my original theater viewing being one of the two greatest film experiences of my life
","When I originally saw this in '98 the first week it was out, I knew nothing about what to expect. As chance would have it, I was late to the theater and didn't get into the auditorium until just as we're moving in on the giant clock. I did not hear the opening studio-imposed narration or see anything prior to that clock. This not-quite-actually-existent version of the film I'd rate as unquestionably up there among the greatest films of all time. It was such a profound experience that for many years I refused to watch it on a smaller screen in digital and only finally did so on a top-of-the-line setup I knew was capable of actually some semblance of the dynamic range Proyas intended. That's a long time with only a memory of a single film viewing. I've heard people having that sort of inability to bring themselves to watch Lawrence of Arabia on anything but 70mm projection. Dark City was sort of my Lawrence of Arabia. These subsequent much later viewings of Dark City, though not quite up to the film viewing, surprisingly had a similar emotional impact on me as the original. There is only one other film that had such an effect on me on the big screen that I hesitated to see it on the small screen later, but that one I still refuse to re-watch.However, the director's cut of Dark City adds too much footage beyond just getting rid of that idiotic opening spoiler. The extended row boat scene now is far too long and spoils even more than the original opening did. The ultimate reveal is later.
The theatrical cut's efficiency in editing also worked slightly better than what people are now calling the 'slow burn' of the extended takes and painstaking match-cuts in the director's version. Some of the extended takes and improved match-cuts do add some lucidity to it, are appreciated, and aren't harmful, but clearly the rhythm and flow of the theatrical cut was not hampered by these differences beyond the opening studio-imposed spoiler.My recommendation: watch the theatrical version the first time but skip to the clock. Start after the clock if you have to with everything muted and then rewind to the clock, unpause, and unmute.This film is begging for a new >4k re-telecine because the original telecine to digital was not great and the later 2k transfer for the director's cut only did the additional footage and didn't redo the original theatrical footage. Neither is up to modern standards now, but the theatrical transfer, in particular, has not aged well side-by-side on the bluray. Probably they need to go back to the original negatives, effects plates, and redo all the opticals digitally as was done on Aliens and Bladerunner. The first run prints of Dark City were unbelievably gorgeous like you cannot believe, with color and contrasts that I have never seen matched in any film before or since.",10,2,2,24 December 2018
Selma," Worth seeing but kind of blah execution on an important subject
","I found Selma surprisingly hard to get into and finish past about the first 30 minutes. I kept stopping and taking breaks until reaching the end. It's kind of unengaging, by-the-numbers, and doesn't draw you in like I hoped.The casting isn't quite right. Oyelowo doesn't seem to know how to pull off MLK's restraint and leave the drama for the words and the voice. Doesn't look like him. Doesn't sound like him. Doesn't act like him. Randy Quaid was also a better LBJ.Costumes were even a miss. Selma's re-imagined 60s mens suits have stupidly-high notches and/or Parisian lapels. Oliver Stone films had far more accurate clothes compared to this Hollywoodized version.My favorite aspect about Selma was probably the FBI stuff that, in my opinion, is never out of place to talk about.",5,1,1,22 January 2019
Sicario," Ignore the Trailers
","I'd rather you just not read this review and instead just go see the film. You probably won't believe me and you'll assume I'm exaggerating out of the novelty or short term memory exuberance. Heck, this isn't even really a review.The trailers aren't quite as over-the-top as they were with Heat, but this film suffers from the same marketing schlock as it did. Another assassin or crime-related movie thing with a sweeping scope. Can't possibly be as good as how they're trying way too hard to hype it. They're not even trying to be subtle. Like Heat, though, it turns out the tone, development, payoffs, performances, blah blah blah in Sicario are actually way beyond expectations. I could go on and on about the tone and pacing. The restraint is incredible. The dissemination of info is even more impressive. In less than probably the first 20 to 30 minutes you'll figure out you're watching a masterwork here. Brilliant direction. I didn't care for Prisoners because it never needed to be remade. The original was fine. But this guy's a MAJOR talent. I am floored. Prepare to be schooled with the new benchmark in you-are-not-supposed-to-get-to-see-this-kind-of-inside-stuff voyeur action/thriller/suspense/shooter/mystery/crime flick. You can pretty much just give him his best direction Oscar now. It would be embarrassing for anyone else to accept it this year.",10,0,3,14 October 2015
American Made," 'He knew what he signed up for.'
","Do we ever fully comprehend how stupid or incompetent our own government can be?Doug Liman, Tom Cruise, and company do Barry Seal justice in this movie.Tom Cruise does a lot of actual flying in this. Good for him. Nice to see.While it might be the most important Hollywood film of 2017, American Made is not perfect.First off, the wife character is not fleshed out enough. She seems just ancillary and undeveloped compared to the equivalent role in Wolf of Wall Street. Was there more left on the cutting room floor because it wasn't any good or was it just written this way? I can't say one way or the other if this actress had the chops to pull off an expanded part, but there's a disappointing lack of much attempt to give us more meat here.This version of Seal has more of the CIA stuff in it than the Hopper film that not only left most of that out but attempted to make the DEA look blameless to over-the-top & embarrassing levels. American Made fibs a bit on how Seal left TWA, still doesn't go back far enough on Seal's actual agency connections, distorts the sequence of events of how Seal got into drug trafficking, and then fibs again at the end on the exact sequence of events when the Reagan administration outed him during their attempts to convince Congress to fund the Contras. Seal was far more connected to the agency and for much longer than the Hopper film shows, with the DEA affiliation occurring later to keep him out of jail that the Hopper film does show. However, he was not conned into drug running due to his connections to the agency and he had a much longer history with both the agency and drugs than American Made portrays. The two, drugs and covert ops, simply went hand-in-hand and had been occurring for some time along with the gunrunning on their behalf. At least as far back as Vietnam, with some indications Seal was involved with the Bay of Pigs. The administration did indeed put his life in jeopardy, though it was not in such a visual manner as in this film.I will also add that there are many further allegations not covered in this movie of the Clintons' complicity in CIA operations through Arkansas that explain some of Hillary Clinton's later bizarre agenda of continuing to promote revolutions around the world during the 2016 campaign, not to mention various other questionable deeds that have been revealed through Wikileaks.There are also some odd connections between Obama's family and the agency, as well, which might explain some of the backlash against Trump from the intelligence community for him being an un-vetted, unconnected outsider with no prior affiliation or loyalty to them. You'd just had Reagan, Bush senior (former DCI), Bill Clinton, Bush Jr (who is portrayed here by the perfectly-cast Connor Trinneer), and now Obama in a row. Couldn't have been easy for the community to stomach. You don't need a conspiracy to have aligned interests, past connections, and sharp elbows resulting in new friction.Oh, you might also want to go back and watch Blow after this. Carlos Lehder was helping the CIA out, too, and probably knew Seal was already CIA from the beginning of Seal's involvement with the Medellin cartel. It starts to explain why the cartel was so trustful of Seal even with his legal troubles and then went out of their way to try and involve the Sandinistas in drug smuggling if you have Lehder pushing for it and Seal there to help. Lehder is now in 'protective custody' in the US federal prison system under an assumed identity.Will the USA ever get the equivalent of Truth and Reconciliation as those supposedly inferior nations around the world have been achieving as they surpass us in justice and honesty? Probably not, but we get a small taste of it at least in our arts like here in American Made.",8,1,4,20 October 2017
The Martian," Send Him Friends
","I joked before this came out that it should have been re-written from the book to act as an explanation to why Interstellar didn't just settle humans on Mars. Maybe they find some big reason with Matt's mission that means Mars is out of the question later... or better yet, he lies, cuz he's a lying liar who steals spaceships and makes up stories why Mars is unfit for colonies. No luck. But all is not lost.This is more realistic, I think, than either Gravity or Interstellar, though it's still trying very hard to be as NASA as possible, with big space ships, 'private time', and, in the case of The Martian, not wanting to logically and rationally use the resources of Mars to survive... like making your own fuel for your buggy so you don't have to keep recharging it so frequently. Internal combustion works so much better, folks. If they'd put that in, though, I guess NASA loses face since they didn't come up with that first. NASA does get some cute rib cracking PR-shill 'image management' stuff by way of Kristen Wigg. She was adorable and hilarious. That was a pleasant surprise. We really need Congress to pass a law stopping agencies from spending any money on influencing public opinion at all. Equally surprising was Jeff Daniels' complex director and the dynamics with staff.The dust storm was not only stupid, but looked like it was ripped right out of Prometheus. That briefly took me out of the movie. I'm not sure why Mars movies keep using that. Rocket Man. Red Planet (not as bad as it originally seemed... watch it again, forget the horrible Mission to Mars). There's enough danger in space and on Mars not to need borrowing anything from LV426's eviler twin (the hell didn't they just make it LV426 in that movie?!).It also seemed like half their crew was red headed, which made me think maybe the gingers were being relocated to Mars or at least were being seeded there to save their race from recessive gene homogeneity extinction here on Earth or something. Hah. But nope...By the end of it, I was slightly perturbed they didn't just send more people and stuff to join Matt instead. If you have a family back on Earth, why are you even being chosen to go there in the first place? The end does attempt to explain the utility of this, at least. They'd be better off just spending the money to keep sending more people and supplies there rather than building huge starships and trying to launch off Mars. Besides, getting off the red planet is not an easy notion. They still oversimplify the orbital mechanics a teeny tiny bit and in one stinker line actually wonder how much fuel it would take to just point their nose where they want to go and fire an engine in orbit. At least they do mention the word 'altitude' soon after, but that whole exchange seemed like a slip. They could have done more to show the communications delay. They talk about it once or twice and then kind of sort of show it explicitly a little, but there's a lot of editing and a lot of not taking the best route, which is showing the characters doing something else in the meantime between messages.While some of the dialog in Gravity was truly awful and its realism was more akin to 'truthiness' than any sense of space science accuracy (it looked great, though), I think on the whole, The Martian is only about at Gravity's level in terms of satisfaction in the film-going experience kind of way, ignoring the science factor and Gravity's lame dialog in the beginning that I found easy to forgive. Don't get me wrong; I found both satisfying enough to recommend. The sometimes laborious Interstellar I'd still put slightly up a notch even with its bizarrely-abbreviated time between discovering NASA and the launch, and then the clunky and obvious tesseract and watch scene. There is something more lofty and artistic about Interstellar, even if you ignore the intimations of quantum gravity propulsion and future affecting the past that I am obviously partial to (you're welcome, Jonathan Nolan... I'm just glad someone, anyone, used it). Time dilation, even though they took the goofy route of using a neat- looking but unnecessary black hole to encounter it along with the needlessness of a wormhole, however also pretty, to transit to it, is a wonderful dramatic device that clearly too many science fiction screen writers neglect. You have to give Interstellar props for both using time dilation, having an artful structure, and even loftier themes than The Martian, even with the clunk factor of yet another The Brothers Nolan project's third act not quite living up to the rest. There's nothing *that* unpredictable about The Martian, either. In comparison, I think the final scene of Interstellar is brilliant and *it* had totally slipped my mind.I liked The Martian. I recommend it. Could have been better, but I'm thankful we got three pretty darn good harder sci fi space films of late. They're not entertaining or artistic enough for me to quite want to watch them repeatedly as some others of my favorites. Decent occasional experiences that are notable for being more realistic and not so stupid all the time like most the crap Hollywood pumps out. That's something to be thankful for.",8,1,4,5 November 2015
