Angels & Demons," A Solid Thriller
","While 'Angels & Demons' is by no means a great film, it at least manages to be consistently solid, which places it head and tails above its sorry predecessor.From its mildly creepy opening to its mildly exciting finish, 'Angels' is a fairly effective thriller. The plot bears quite a few similarities to that of 'Da Vinci,' especially concerning the supporting characters, but it does introduce a strong device not present in the first film. Each stop on Robert Langdon's journey through Rome works as an excellent set-piece. Director Howard seems with these scenes to have a good feel for eerie suspense and gruesome reveals. Furthermore, once these set-pieces are all over, the plot takes on a whole new heart-pounding direction that lasts until the fitting, if slightly underwhelming, climax.Thusly, the plot proceeds from first frame to last, following for the most part the footsteps of Professor Langdon, played pretentiously yet again by Tom Hanks. It seems that to be a Harvard professor one must be bitterly sarcastic with everyone and deliver dragging monologues about history that long overstay their welcome. In fact, according to 'Angels & Demons,' the same can be said of Camerlengos. Ewan McGregor plays the film's Camerlengo all too convincingly, pouring out endless dull speeches about the nature of faith and of mankind. The fault in this case lies wholly in the hands of the screenplay. Strangely enough, however, this same screenplay gives very few words to Vittoria Vetra, the apparent female lead, who is played inoffensively by Ms. Zuret. Stellan Skarsgard and Armin Mueller-Stahl fortunately fare better in their roles.Despite its shortcomings in some areas, the cast delivers on the whole, leading one to wonder why the film isn't better than it is. The real culprit here, in a twist worthy of a Dan Brown novel, is the screenplay. The movie drags on for an seat-squirming 138 minutes, matching each inspired thrill with a heavy-handed monologue or a piece of unnecessary historical jargon. Beautiful shots cannot beat bad pacing in this case. In fact, forty minutes of this film could be scraped away to great effect. Sadly, the said forty minutes were not cut, and this film is what it is. It's not bad, but it's no masterpiece.",6,10,18,19 June 2009
Vertigo," Hitchcock Strikes Again
","'Vertigo' is perhaps Hitchcock's most twisted film, but it is also one of his best, as well as one of the best films ever made. Everything about the film is pitch-perfect. I won't disclose plot details here so as not to spoil anyone who hasn't seen the film yet, but I will say the following.The casting in 'Vertigo' could have failed miserable had it not been done in such a careful manner. Jimmy Stewart is probably the most likable actor in film history, which makes him the only person in the world who could have played the main role in this film without repulsing the audience. He keeps the main role of Scotty afloat for the entire film when no other actor could've done the same with such a twisted role. The same could be said of Kim Novak, who portrays the leading lady perfectly, managing to appear devious and sympathetic in alternating frames. Still, my favorite performance of the film is that of the role of Midge. Barbare plays this desperate friend of Scotty's in such a sympathetic way that we almost want Scotty to run off and marry her, even if it means ruining the film.'Vertigo' is a well-made film all around. The cinematography is creepy and enchanting, as is the beautifully composed script. Of course, the real star of the film id=s the classic Bernard Hermann score, which is one of his best, probably second only to the score for 'Psycho.' In 'Vertigo,' Hitchcock masterfully proves that he is not solely a murder mystery director, and that he can create suspense even in a love affair between two deeply troubled characters. It's twisted, certainly, but it has to be. It's a fantastic film and one of the master's best.",10,5,6,29 September 2007
Walk the Line," An Oscar-worthy Film Masterpiece
","Lately, Hollywood has spewed out so many pieces of movie junk that it's become very hard to wade through them all and find truly worthy films. 'Walk the Line' is one of these films.The Music: 10/10 The greatest Johnny and June Carter Cash songs were chosen for this film, and the singing is not only worthy, but fantastic. Reese Witherspoon's singing was especially shocking and fantastic.The Acting: 8/10 Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Pheoix give Oscar-worthy performances, but the supporting cast is rather dull and un-talented for the most part.The Length: 7/10 The film drags on a bit at times and starts off very slow. It could have been condensed into an even finer film than it is.The Story: 8/10 It's very gripping for the most part, and ends appropriately. Perhaps a bit more focus on June Carter would have made it even better and a bit livelier.Overall, 'Walk the Line' has a good message, good acting, and good music. Even people who've never heard of Mr. Cash will love it.",8,0,0,4 May 2007
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not a Ground-Breaking Success, But Not a Menace
","I'm a Star Wars fan, and always have been. In fact, I saw 'A New Hope' for the first time at one of its re-releases at age one and immediately fell in love with the franchise. For this reason, I was enormously excited when I found that a new prequel to the series was being created. Needless to say, I was disappointed by the film.I expected to see an adolescent cool-cat Anakin step up and turn bad. Instead, I got a terrible child actor trying to save his mother and not even bearing a hint of his imminent future. I expected immense and glorious space battles, but instead got a particularly boring scene in which the above-mentioned child takes on a fleet of comically ridiculous droid fighters. I was expecting to see storm troopers marching around in some form, but all i got was some dorky droids.Iwasn't happy about the film.However, now that I have viewed the entire new trilogy, the film makes more sense, though not much. It seems to lack any real plot developments in the long run, unlike Episodes Two and Three. Still, the film is visually competent, and it is nice to see the first modern interpretation of the Star Wars galaxy since the early 1980s. There's also another factor that bumped my score up from a 4 or 5 to a 6. This factor is Darth Maul.Darth Maul is one of the coolest Star Wars villains in the history of the films, falling short of Vader and Boba Fett, but falling only a small bit short of General Greivous. His scenes are the high points of the film. They are fast-paced, fun, and truly suspenseful. More importantly, they take us away from Jake Lloyd and Natalie Portman, who give awful performances. This film is not even in the same league as any of the original trilogy, and it falls short of the other two newer ones. However, it's not a terrible film, and can be enjoyed.Warning: Make sure that you take a bathroom break anytime an alien called Jar Jar Binks comes on-screen to truly enjoy the experience.",7,2,4,30 May 2007
3:10 to Yuma," 'I Hate Posses'
","As he did with 'Walk the Line' two years ago, James Mangold has brought an element of aged entertainment back into the spotlight for new generations to enjoy. This time, however, instead of picking up a bunch of Johnny Cash CDs, viewers are sure to run to the stores and pick up some classic westerns.With '3:10 to Yuma,' Mangold and crew have re-vitalized the Western in a new style that still manages to hold on to what we all love about Westerns. The film stars Christian Bale and Russell Crowe as two men divided by the law and by their sense of justice. Bale plays the 'good guy,' but he still manages to have some serious gray areas. Crowe plays the villain, though he's perhaps the most likable character in the film. Early on in the film, we see just how much influence Crowe's character holds over his crew, but it's completely believable. As we see more and more of him, we start to like him, eve if he is a brutal killer. What's interesting is that he acts in a way that he considers just.The plot is simple, though it is full of character development and intensity. There are some scenes that actually manage to be very emotionally true. There are some scenes that make you laugh hysterically until you realize how twisted the humor is. There are some scenes where the intensity goes on full-blast and we get that cool 'Western' feeling. Al in all, it's a great story with enough great scenes to fill a whole city.What brings this film to the next level is the acting. Christian Bale is very restrained and subtle as the protagonist, and his performance suits the film well. Peter Fonda gives a great minor performance that is sure to arouse memories of his father's older roles. Still there are two performances in this film that should surely be nominated for Oscars. Russell Crowe deserves a Best Actor nod for his fun and likable portrayal of such a complex and gray-shaded villain. This may be his best performance so far in his career. However, the show-stealer here is really Ben Foster as Charlie Prinze, Wade's (Crowe's) right-hand man. He embodies the classic spirit of a western villain. His lines are the best and most quotable in the film. His expressions and accent are also pitch-perfect. He utilizes his heavily-made-up face to create some of the most intense moments of the film. He also plays one of the most interesting characters in the film. He has a devotion for Crowe's character that is so strong and so passionate that it borders on (if not crosses) some unwritten lines that were only barely touched upon in past Westerns, with the exception of a particularly 'different' one that came out a couple of years ago.See '3:10 to Yuma' for the acting. See it for the upsetting but powerful take on violence. If none of these things appeal to you, just see it for the chase and shoot-out scenes and for the sheer fun spirit that the film embodies.",10,1,3,29 September 2007
The Hangover," A Good Time
","'The Hangover' is a fun movie. It's consistently entertaining, even when a few of its jokes fall flat. The plot is predictable, the characters are familiar, and the film says nothing. Still, it works as an enjoyable movie to sit down to after a long day.The plot is simple. Doug is getting married, so his two best friends and brother-in-law-to-be take him to Las Vegas for a weekend of hard liquor, strippers, and gambling. Things escalate quickly when Phil and Stu (Doug's friends) wake up in their hotel room with Doug's brother-in-law, a tiger, a baby, and an assortment of random odds and ends. The only thing missing is Doug.'The Hangover' tells the story of the men's quest for Doug; they need to find and recover him before the time of his wedding. The plot doesn't matter all that much; it's more of an excuse to put in an endless flow of gags. Fortunately, the gags work, and so does the movie. It never tries to be poignant or PC, and it has a bunch of laugh-out-loud moments. Accusations of racism, sexism, and homophobia seem a little out-of-place; all three issues are treated in intentionally absurd fashion.All three of the main actors give good comedic performances, and the script clips along smoothly. This is not a 'great' movie, but it doesn't try to be.",8,1,2,18 January 2010
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The Greatest Adventre Film Ever Made
","'Raiders of the Lost Ark' was one of the first films I saw as a young child, and it was then and still remains one of my favorite films of all time. Harrison Ford basically defines cool in his role as Indiana Jones. The supporting cast is also perfect at doing the jobs necessary to make the film great. There are funny moments, horrific moments, and moments of pure excitement as Indiana goes on his wild adventures. There's a sadistic villain with a fitting trademark, double-crossers, and of course Indie's brave allies. The action is immense, the effects are gorgeous, and the film ages very well. This is a stupendous film, the likes of which will never again be repeated. The plot is of course somewhat far-fetched, but it is presented in an interesting and realistic fashion, forcing us to buy into it. I'd recommend this film to kids 'from 1 to 92.'",10,1,2,16 June 2007
United 93," Deeply Inspiring Tragic Tale
","We all know the story. We all remember where we were when we heard the news about the terrible tragedy that occurred on September 11, 2001. For that reason, this is one of the most important films ever made in the history of American cinema. 'United 93' tells the gut-wrenching true story of the brave passengers on United Flight 93, and their desperate and selfless act to stop the terrorists on-board from crashing the plane into the capital building.The beauty of the film is that it does not make any controversial statements about the vent. Nor does it try to spin the story for its own purposes. It simply tells a true story of bravery against all odds. There is no exploitation in the film, nor is there any action simply for the sake of entertainment. Paul Greengrass simply puts forth the story as if we were there on-board or there on the ground. There's no mention of Osama Bin Laden or Iran and Afghanistan. Greengrass doesn't manipulate the characters for his own purposes. He simply shows them for who they truly were: people. Though sad, the film is truly inspiring and I am extremely proud of the passengers aboard that flight, especially after seeing the film. It ends at just the right moment and is almost poetic in a tragic way. This is what a four-star film truly is.",10,3,6,6 June 2007
Finding Neverland," An Emotional Charmer
","My strong liking for 'Finding Neverland' is very strange, being that I despise every other film on Mark Froster's resume. However, this is a great film and Forster's usually annoying sincerity and sentimentality is the perfect touch for this film. Johnny Depp shows what a great actor he really is when he takes off all the makeup and quirky mannerisms to pull off a phenomenal performance as Mr. J. M. Barrie. His acting, which in this film is restrained on the surface but powerful within, takes away the possible dullness of the film. The story itself moves along at a rather slow pace, but is charming and enjoyable the entire time. It is driven by stand-out performances by the above-mentioned star as well as Dustin Hoffman and the lovely Kate Winslet. If not already nominated for 'Eternal Sunshine,' Winslet would surely have received an Oscar nod for this film. The other show-stealer in the movie is actually the young Freddie Highmore. Having not yet received all the fame and offers he did after 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,' Highmore acts without any of the arrogance or pretentiousness that we have now become accustomed to seeing him with. The story itself, which is mostly true, is saddening, but at the same time breath-taking and deeply emotional. It's a tear-jerker to the highest degree, and is a great film for men and women of all ages. See it for the fascinating story and the stellar performances.",8,2,2,21 June 2007
Chinatown," 'Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.'
","In 'Chinatown,' Jack Nicholson plays Jake Gittes, a private eye who bites on to more than he can chew when he begins to investigate the murder of a big-shot in the L.A. water industry.Characters/Plot: 10/10 The screenplay of 'Chinatown,' which is arguably the best ever written, won the film's only Academy Award. Why? Because it's amazing! There are so many memorable lines in the film, and every twist in the plot is completely unpredictable. The characters are of course ingenious as well.Acting: 10/10 The film has two great leading performances, one great large supporting performance, and a ton of great smaller turns. Jack Nicholson gives the performance of his career as Jake Gittes, while Faye Dunaway complements him nicely as Evelyn, a mysterious woman with a twisted past. John Huston is also terrific as Noah Cross, a bigwig with a suspicious demeanor. My favorite of the smaller performances was that of Roman Polanski (the director) as a knife-wielding goon.Technical: 10/10 The violent scenes are shockingly realistic for a 1970s film, the sound and visual effects line up nicely, the cinematography is completely amazing, and the score is classic.Atmosphere: 10/10 The atmosphere of the film is its true strongest point. The costumes and at direction give off the feel of old-time Los Angeles, and the film manages to be creepy and mysterious all the way through. The score for the film is subtle but brilliant.Entertainment: 9/10 The plot moves along very well, and the film never really lets go of you once you start watching. There are really no unnecessary scenes either.Final Score: A+ 9.8/10 (49/50)",10,0,2,3 August 2007
Star Trek," Taking down the 'Members Only' sign
","Like a group of elitist schoolboys, the makers of 'Star Trek' have worked hard over the years to make the 'Star Trek' Club as inaccessible and out of reach as possible for the everyday film-goer/television viewer. Luckily, thanks to JJ Abrams and his cast and crew on this film, the 'Members Only' sign that so dauntingly covered the door of the franchise has been taken down, hopefully once and for all.Taking a cue from the bigwigs of television, this film has put together a cast of likable and attractive young upstarts for a relatively tight, action-packed, and sequel-worthy plot line with a throbbing musical score and awe-inspiring visuals.Chris Pine leads the cast in a star-making turn as Captain Kirk. He oozes charisma and doesn't fall into the trap of imitating Shatner. Similarly, Zachary Quinto creates a Spock for this generation, bringing nuances of youthful emotion to the unforgettable character. Great support comes from Zoe Seldana as a feistily intelligent Ahorra, Karl Urban as the spitting image of the original Bones McCoy, and Bruce Greenwood as the cool and collective current captain of the Enterprise. Only Eric Bana comes up short, sporting an uninspired makeup job and dishing out his lines in a questionable accent.Of course, a cast is nothing without a screenplay and a plot. Fortunately, the plot here is sure to be loved by fans of the franchise and newcomers alike. The origin stories of Kirk and Spock play out beautifully. The opening scene, which centers around Kirk's father, is filled with emotional impact, starting the film- and Kirk for that matter- off with a bang. The remainder of the scenes leading up to the inevitable launch of the Enterprise sustain marvelously as well, blending funny lines and slapstick moments with more dramatic touches.Once the crew finally gathers together for the mission that comprises the rest of the film, sparks are ready to fly and the adrenaline of the audience is already creeping up the scale.The film's final Act is a blast, full of exciting battles between spacecrafts and people alike. At the end of the film, emotional swelling is perfectly understandable. While the movie does have some great inside jokes for fans of the franchise, it can and should be experienced not just by the insiders, but by everyone.",10,1,13,19 June 2009
Citizen Kane," 'Rosebud'
","Being relatively young, my real interest in great films began only a couple of years ago, and ever since my interest sprouted, I have heard the title 'Citizen Kane' thrown around as the greatest movie ever made. Is it really? I had to find out.'Kane' opens as newspaper tycoon Charles Kane utters his last word 'Rosebud,' dropping a snow globe on to the floor. This cryptic death launches an investigation by a young reporter into what 'rosebud' is. As the reporter travels around and interviews significant people in Charlie's life, we find out more and more about the man through flashbacks of the interviewees. There's an air of mystery all throughout the film, being that we know no more than the reporter.The performances in 'Kane' are all stellar, especially Orson Welles's memorable turn as Kane himself.He rules the picture with his commanding and realistic performance. The acting is also well showcased by an extraordinary achievement in cinematography. Though the film is not done in color, the background and lighting provides more emotion and mystery than almost any color film to date.So, is 'Citizen Kane' the greatest film of all time? I'm not sure, but it's certainly one of my favorites. It's a tremendous story of love, lust, power, corruption, greed, and rosebud. Still, what really makes this film stand out is that Welles cleverly gives us hints to the truth of the mystery of the film all throughout, and the 'twist' ending is sure to send chills down your spine. See it for the acting, see it for the technical aspects, or see it to see if it really is the greatest of all time. Just see it.",10,1,2,20 July 2007
Inglourious Basterds," The Best Film of 2009
","'Inglourious Basterds' is a perfect film. It boasts an incredible script, an innovative score, rich cinematography, great performances, and the finest direction job by any director this year.Characters, rather than situations, form the heart of 'Inglourious Basterds.' The film's narrative structure cleverly introduces these characters in their respective backgrounds, only to thrust them together as time progresses. Shosanna, a young French woman, runs a cinema that may play host to the upcoming release of a Jewish propaganda film. The film stars Nazi soldier Fredrick Zoller. The Nazi officer in charge of security for the event is Hans Landa, the 'Jew Hunter.' Lt. Aldo Raine and his 'Inglourious Basterds' see the release as an opportunity for them to strike. They employ the services of British officer Hicox and German actress Bridget Von Hammersmark.Each character is richly drawn, both through the script and through the acting. Melanie Laurent is ferocious as the dynamic Shosanna. Christoph Waltz shatters the screen as Hans Landa. Michael Fassbender, Brad Pitt, and Diane Kruger also do exceptionally well. The plot itself moves at the ideal pace. It's full of outstanding set-pieces and dialogue scenes, the most notable being the opening conversation and a scene at a bar (I'm being intentionally vague).'Inglourious Basterds' is entertaining and outstandingly well-made. It warrants its run-time and its sprawling plot. It's the best film of the year.",10,0,5,18 January 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," 'Chest' Packed Full of Laughs and Thrills
","'Dead Man's Chest' is a great film, full of non-stop fun and thrills. The overall look of the film is mysterious and entrancing. It's the most land-locked film in the trilogy, allowing for more beautiful location shots and slapstick action. The Oscar-winning effects are also amazing, surpassing anything I've ever seen before in a film.The acting in the film is great, similarly to the first film. Johnny Depp is, again, hilarious as Jack Sparrow. Keira Knightley and Jonathon Pryce also give good supporting performances, though Orlando Bloom is certainly not phenomenal.The laughs are everywhere, along with the twists and thrills. There are sword-fights, burnings, and a crew of ridiculously stupid pirates. The villains in the film are much more intimidating than Geoffrey Rush's character in the first and third films. Bill Nighy is great as the cruel Davy Jones and the Kraken was one of the greatest creatures ever created on camera. If for nothing else, see it for the laughs and the effects. It's not as good as the first nor the third, but it's still an enjoyable film.",7,0,2,13 June 2007
Public Enemies," This Film Should Be Shot
","Whether by firing squad, by assassination, or by suicide, this film should be shot and killed. Rarely in cinema history has such an abomination of heinous execution and excruciating boredom been allowed to live on screen.Johnny Depp, in his blandest and most overly calculated performance to date, plays convict extraordinare. Marion Cotillard, in a role that gives her nothing interesting to do, plays his love interest. Christian Bale, who casts aside any charm or wit he might have shown in other roles, plays G-man Melvin Purvis. The rest of the cast is rounded out by an assortment of actors doing their best cop/robber impersonations.The plot is simple. Dillinger goes on a final romp while Purvis tracks him down. That's basically all there is to it, since the film's laughable cinematography and editing make the scenes incoherent. In one particular shoot-out in the woods, the shots are so choppy and the lighting so poor that it's impossible to tell what's going on. The costumes and art direction are probably great, but Mann shuns establishing shots, so we don't get a chance to see them.'Public Enemies' is poorly scripted, poorly edited, poorly shot, and poorly acted. It is far too long, and its plot deflates early on. This movie is unworthy of the greats involved with it, and it deserves to die.",2,0,0,19 January 2010
Spider-Man 2," One of the Best Superhero Films of all Time
","Spiderman 2 is an exception to almost every rule in the book. It's a sequel, it's a superhero film, and it follows another very good film. The stage is therefore set for an awful movie. However, Spiderman 3 is anything but awful. First, we have the special effects. Unlike the first Spiderman film, the action is no longer cartoonish. Instead of looking like a cheap video game, everything looks real. The acting is also satisfactory or above across the board. Maguire and Frnaco are much less awkward, Dunst is more believable, and Alfred Molina is fantastic as Dock Ock. In Spiderman 1, the Green Goblin is corny and not-at-all intimidating. Dock Ock, however, is a terrific villain. Though Molina is not always frightening, the 'tentacles' are amazingly threatening and cool to watch. The action isn't glamorized like it was in the first film. The whole story comes to life in an action-packed and great overall film.",8,1,2,19 May 2007
500 Days of Summer," Captures the Generation
","'(500) Days of Summer,' seems like a simple romantic comedy from the DVD cover. It's not. It's an unconventional comedy that captures the 2000s generation.'(500) Days of Summer' is not a love story. Leads Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel don't begin the film as rivals/enemies and end it as lovers in the screwball fashion spurred by Tracy/Hepburn and company. They don't have a hot-cold romance that eventually falls through, in the Annie Hall tradition. In '(500) Days,' Gordon-Levitt's Tom falls head-over-heels in love with Zooey Deschanel's Summer. He doesn't have that Woody Allen 'devil may care' attitude, where you doubt that the romance really means all that much to him. He is totally smitten. The wrench in the works is Summer. She's just not in love with Tom. Their relationship actually loses steam and fizzles out with Tom despairing and Summer.....well......feeling alright.This sounds like a spoiler review, but it's not. Part of the innovation of this film is its structure. Thanks to visual cues on screen, the film jumps from day to day, whether forward or backwards. The film opens at the end of the relationship, the jumps all throughout its 500 days. This keeps the narrative fresh and interesting, and doesn't allow the sadder scenes to sink the film into depression.This is THE romantic comedy for this generation. The characters are bitingly sarcastic and pop culturally-aware. Their conversations are compelling and witty, and their clothes have that undeniably 'hipster' quality. They love 'vintage' items, and they think.talk about profound subjects. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are perfectly cast. They play the leads with genuine humanity and interest. They shine especially in the scenes towards the end of the romance, where snappy dialogue gives way to mood swings and foreboding.'(500) Days of Summer' will assuredly becomes the basis for a new generation of tired romantic comedies, but it rises above the mold and will hopefully always be remembered as a rend-setter rather than just part of the trend. With a great soundtrack, a memorable dance sequence, and an innovative structure, '(500) Days of Summer' has entered the canon of the greats.",10,0,0,16 January 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Yo Ho and a Bottle of Fun!
","Is Pirates 3 the best of the trilogy? No. Is it as good as the first? Not really. Is it better than the second? You bet. Is it a great film? YES! 'POTC 3' is a great, fun movie-going experience. When I go to the movies, i don't want to see some cute little indie or another romantic comedy with some big names. I want to see a film with big action and big laughs: a film where it pays to have hundreds of people sitting around you. 'Pirates' certainly fits into this category.'At World's End' is basically the story of how all the opened holes from the second film are sealed up. Luckily, however, it doesn't seem forced at all. The film is long, but it stays strong all the way through. It's a funny, thrilling, and beautiful thrill ride.The laughs in 'At World's End' are numerous, and they pop up all throughout the film. like in the first 'POTC,' we even get funny one-liners and slapstick laughs during serious sword fights. There's slapstick comedy, great humorous dialogue, jokes about pirates, situational irony, and every other kind of humor you could possibly imagined. I laughed out loud more during this film than during 'You, Me, and Dupree,' 'Little Man,' and 'Just my Luck' combined.The visuals are stunning, as expected. I found myself examining Bill Nighy's digital Davy Jones 'face' whenever he was on screen. The area shots are also beautiful, and the film looks really expensive, which is a good thing.Depp steals the show as usual with his fantastic performance, but Keira Knightly, Geoffrey Rush, and Bill Nighy held up well as well, turning in stellar work. Keira Knightley was especially terrific. She is one of the few gorgeous modern women who can act extraordinarily well while entrancing the audience with her looks.Yes, the film is a bit long and unruly, but the whole thing is enjoyable. Johnny Depp is always immensely interesting and fun to watch, and the plot is very funny in itself. This is a great film for any pirates fan, and I urge you to see it.",8,1,3,8 June 2007
Spider-Man 3," A Disappointment
","My first reaction to this film when I saw it last Friday was, What the heck?? I feel like I can't even have an opinion about the movie because it's so all-over-the-place. We get dramatic special effects scenes, stylized but cool villain battles, a strange black-suit core plot, a romance side story, and the typical villain back-stories. There have always been these kinds of elements in the Spiderman movies, but in this one, they're over-packed. There's just too much, and for the most part, none of it is great. I'll break it down into different sections so my vote will make sense.Effects Extravaganzas 8/10 The effects in the movie are breath-taking. The problem with the purely effects-based scenes is that the coolness factor wears off quickly. When Spiderman dives through wreckage in slow motion to save a damsel-in-distress (we later find that her name is Gwen Stacy), the excitement only lasts about a second. Then, I just wanted it to speed up.Romance Sub-plot 2/10 By far the worst part of the movie is this sub-plot. We meet a new possible love interest for Pete (the above-mentioned Gwen Stacy), but she proves to be a very thin and boring character in the film, kind of like Mary Jane. MJ does what she did in the first two films for the most part. She whines, cries, gets captured, has useless fights with Peter, and performs terribly on the stage. However, now these things are repetitive, and this installment amps them up to the max. MJ seems to whine constantly, her kidnapping is more predictable than in the first two, she performs badly on Broadway instead of a local theater, and all of her fun and deep enigma is gone. In addition, she and Pete take turns acting like jerks to each other.Villain Back-stories 3/10 I'll start by saying that Sandman is not exactly a menacing villain. His back-story is completely repetitive and ridiculous, verging on corny. Eddie Brock, on the other hand, could have been done well. However, Topher Grace turns in the worst performance of the film as Eddie, and does not become threatening or cool at all until he turns to Venom.Black Suit Core Plot 7/10 The parts of the film focusing on the black suit are not menacing, like I expected, but rather funny and quirky. Unfortunately, this campy plot does not fit with the rest of the film, which tries to be dark. Spidey and Peter Parker both get emo make-overs, and Peter becomes a loser who thinks that he's insanely cool, strutting down the street and dancing 1970s style.Villain Battles 10/10 The battles that Pete has with the New Goblin, Venom, and Sandman are the best parts of the film, and make it worth seeing. This is where the big budget comes into play. Seeing Spidey kick butt has never been so real as it is now. Though I give it a rather low rating, I urge you to see it just for the experience of seeing Spiderman as you've never seen him before in battle. Still, this movie has fallen under my expectations. Better luck next time, Mr. Raimi (if there is one).",5,1,2,10 May 2007
The Prestige," Truly Magical
","'The Prestige' was box office magic, and for good reason. The film chronicles the brutal rivalry between two former friends, Angier (Hugh Jackamn) and Borden (Christian Bale). The story is set in 19th century Britain, and is a tale of magic, betrayal, greed, and trickery. So as not to spoil the plot, I'll focus on the acting and visuals, mostly. Angier is the more likable magician of the two rivals, and this is mainly due to the superb portrayal of him by Hugh Jackman. Jackman is not over-the-top, yet possesses an unwritten magic about him in this film. He turns in stellar work in a more restrained part than usual. Bale is effective and very good as Borden, but I found his character cruel and annoying. Still, he, like Jackamn, does very well with the proper accent. I just felt he was a bit too over-the-top at the wrong moments, and I felt for his wife.Michael Caine plays the mentor of the two magicians, Cutter, and is absolutely superb. His voice is impeccable and easy to listen to, and I really liked his character. Scarlett Johansen, who usually plays trashy and useless roles, is actually very good in the film. She looks fantastic and plays her part just right, with a little bit of sass, but not too much. I also enjoyed the work of David Bowie and Andy Serkis as Tesla the scientist and his assistant.The other magical part of 'The Prestige' is the mood and visuals. The costumes are all pitch-perfect, making the time period obvious. The cinematography is gorgeous, always setting the mood in a kind of subtle way. Christopher Nolan gives the film the dark edginess it needs, and I was engrossed from the beginning.All in all, the film is great. It has its minor flaws, but Christopher Nolan and the cast bring it alive in thrilling fashion. It's a great film for magic enthusiasts, but also for the general audience (I can't do a single magic trick). Go and rent it right now if you can, and you won't be disappointed!",8,1,2,8 June 2007
Crash," Compelling Plot and Strong Acting Provide
","With films like 'Crash,' you have to be very careful. That is to say, you can't underplay the plot to make room for show-stealing roles, and you can't overplay the plot and hide the performances. In my modest opinion, 'Crash' is a great balancing act. Still, though I loved it, I can easily understand why others did not.'Crash' is really a morality tale told through the stories of a day-and-a-half in the lives of several people. There are humongous themes of racism, profiling, and other modern 'taboos.' The real message is that racism is everywhere and in everyone, which is a bold statement. People often comment that they feel as if they're being talked down to as they watch the film, which is understandable, but I had no problem with it. 'Crash' doesn't linger for too long in any certain type of racism, and concentrates more on stories and character studies. Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock, and Ludicrous all hold there own, Terrence Howard is very complex and great to watch, and Matt Dillon gives a stand-out and uncharacteristic performance as the most openly racist character in the film: an ultra-white cop with 'daddy issues.' 'Crash' is a great film, and I think it's worthy of ten stars. still, I wouldn't put it up there with the real greats, like 'The Godfather' and 'Casablanca.' I cannot guarantee that you will like it, but it's worth seeing for the interesting take on racism and the good/great performances.",10,0,6,22 July 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," A Perfect Blend of Fantasy, History, and Horror
","After finally seeing this film after waiting months for the DVD release, I am enormously surprised about a number of things. First of all, I have to wonder how in the world this film did not win the Oscar for Foreign Film. It should have been nominated for Best Picture in general, and has proved to be far superior to this past year's front-runners, like The Departed and Babel.Pan's Labyrinth tells the story of a young girl named Ofelia who is thrust into two frightening worlds when she and her mother go to live with Ofelia's monstrous step-father: a fantasy world set mainly in the labyrinth of a mysterious faun, and also the even more horrifying world of her new father and his men, in which battles constantly rage and no life truly means anything.Pan's Labyrinth is a phenomenal film on every level. Del Toro presents the two worlds in such contrasting ways that the story is always interesting, yet is often very upsetting. The movie is filled to the brim with small motifs, brilliantly diverse characters, and an entertaining storyline. The finale, though rather sad, is extremely meaningful and almost poetic.The acting in the film is also great across the board. Ofelia's character is so believable, and her step-father is played so cruelly that I stopped even thinking of them as actors. The supporting cast is also flawless.The last aspect of the film that I found truly amazing was the overall visual presentation. The art direction was enchanting, the visual effects were startling, and the cinematography gave the film a whole new dimension. However, especially noteworthy is the makeup. The two main mystical creatures in the film are the faun, of course, as well as a disturbing-looking humanoid villain. They both look incredibly mystical, and in the case of the latter, disturbing. Overall, this is one of my favorite movies of all time and I wold recommend it to anyone above the age of 14, due to the intense and brutal violence and gory scenes.",10,2,5,26 May 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," Vastly Unbalanced: More Devil, Please!
","The saddest thing about 'The Devil Wears Prada' is that it had the potential to be such a great film, but ends up drowning in its own mistakes. Though Meryl Streep is the referenced title character and is easily the biggest name in the film, she actually takes on a supporting role. The leading lady is really Anne Hathaway, who is the subject of corruption by the fashion industry.The storyline of the film is rather simple. Anne Hathaway's character is a very smart, mildly attractive, and ambitious girl who aspires to be a great reporter. She eventually decides to interview for an internship under Miranda Priestly (Streep), and of course gets the job. Working beside Emily Blunt's and Stanley Tucci's characters, she finds herself becoming entwined in the fashion industry, wearing more 'stylish' clothing and attending high-class parties and such. From here, a 'Mean Girls' type drama plays out, turning the film on to a much more serious route. The problem is, we've seen it all before. With such a typical and obvious plot, you need a really great cast to pull it off.Meryl Streep gives a fantastic performance as Priestly, always delivering that trademark charm and unique evil. The problem is, we don't spend enough time with her. In fact, I would have much preferred a biopic of Streep's character to this film. Emily Blunt also gives a funny performance, but she also is on-screen too little. Tucci is kind of a bore, giving the same performance he' given tons of times, and then we have Anne Hathaway. Hathaway is not a bad actress, but she is a dreadful bore in the film. The fashion bits and her romantic life are boring and uncomfortable to watch. Still, I would blame this more on the script than the actress.Overall, 'Prada' is not a terrible film. It's simply an average film where we see too little of the should-be and supposed leading lady.",5,1,2,2 June 2007
Gone Baby Gone," Glimmers of Light
","Casey Affleck and Amy Ryan deliver unbelievable performances in 'Gone Baby Gone,' but unfortunately cannot fully redeem the film. The problems with 'Gone Baby Gone' are for the most part products of Ben Affleck as director and Lehaine as the 'brainchild' of the story (the film is adapted from his novel of the same name).Ben Affleck is obsessed with giving the viewers agritty vision of Boston, the setting of the film, and he goes too far. Instead of grittiness, Affleck's focus on ugly people doing ugly things both on the streets and in the story itself results in-well-ugliness. The city has no glimmers of beauty in this film. Instead of shooting for ugliness outside the main story, Affleck could have shot for beauty and the typical outsider-s view of Boston. This would have allowed him to then, through the story, show the uglier side of the same city. The effect would have been marvelous instead of phony, but alas. Affleck makes other mistakes as well. He and his cinematographer shoot too many scenes in a sort of curious darkness. The most effective scenes in the film are shot in the light of day, and they come mostly at the powerful conclusion. The darkness-based scenes feel manipulative and hopeless.Still, Affleck's direction is not all bad. He draws forth great performances from his brother and Michelle Monaghan as the cop principles and from Amy Ryan as a drug-abusing 'bad mother.' Morgan Freeman's flat performance and Ed Harris's just-solid performance come about completely as a result of the source material.Lehaine has done great work before, but the plot of this novel/film is too twisted and too reliant on sketchy coincidences. Only the more simple cop-movie beginning and the fantastic ending ring true. In fact, the middle section, which deals with true colors and pedophiles, is repulsive and contrived. The film includes a plot twist that is completely unnecessary and actually harmful.While even the convoluted patty of this film-sandwich has some good moments, the film is ultimately derailed. Still, Casey Affleck is a great actor and puts on a good show throughout, whenever the material allows.",5,1,2,10 June 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A True Film Masterpiece
","From the opening prologue to the climactic Battle of Amon Hen, 'The Fellowship of the Ring' grabs you and never lets go. This is easily one of the truly greatest films ever made, and is destined to achieve status as a true film classic, much like the novel did so many years ago. Our introduction to the land of Middle Earth is absolutely breath-taking and cannot possibly be expressed in words. It's not about the incredible CGI or the flawless performances. Rather, it's about the true magic that this film seems to possess. I was ten years old when I first saw this film in theaters, and I knew nothing about the 'Lord of the Rings.' Call me ignorant, but this film opened up an entire new world to me. Since its release, I have viewed this first installment alone over twenty times, and I don't even consider myself a fanatic. The story is so classic and so epic that one would have thought it impossible to bring it to the big screen. However, Peter Jackson and the magnificent cast did a great job of it.The film itself is filled with gorgeous location shots, intense skirmishes, and a beautiful aura of intrigue. Ian McKellen, Sean Bean, Elijah Wood, Ian Holm, Sean Astin, and Viggo Mortensen give especially fantastic performances, making there characters deeper and more undefined than simply 'good' or 'bad'. In one of the best performances of the film, Christopher Lee shows us just how much power can corrupt with his portrayal of the darkened White Wizard, Saruman. These actors and the director and crewmen brought an epic fantasy story to life that is one of the major highlights of my childhood. It is a film that everyone can enjoy, and hopefully they will.",10,0,1,30 April 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," The Sun is Shining Brightly on this Film
","Very rarely has a film of this nature come out of nowhere and pleased so many audiences. 'Sunshine' is one of the most intelligent and downright funny comedies that I have ever seen. The Oscar-winning script is relentlessly witty, the plot is far from cliché, the length is not too long or too short, the characters are clever, and the performances are all stupendous.The basic story is really quite simple. A young girl and her incredibly dysfunctional family must go on a road trip across America so that the girl can participate in the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant. Simple and bland? You might think so if you'd never seen the film.The leading roles in this film belong to Greg Kinnear, Toni Colette, and the great Steve Carell. Kinnear, one of the most underrated actors of our time, plays, Richard, the insufferable loser that fathers the family. Toni gives another good performance as Sheryl, the dissatisfied wife who is growing fed up with her ambitious and hopeless husband.In a fantastic performance, Steve Carell steals the show as Frank, Sheryl's brother, a depressed Pruitt scholar who remains likable the entire film without seeming too sentimentalized or bland.This movie is not flashy or over the top. I mean this as a positive thing. Instead of simply filming ridiculous and over-the-top slapstick scenes, this film focuses on smart humor to win the crowds over. The scenes in the film range from simple (dinnertime in the Hoover household), to sick and disturbing (the hospital scene and the pageant). Nothing is glamorized or made uglier. Things are simply the way they are. This movie is phenomenal and in my opinion, it should have won the Oscar. Go see it!!!!!!!!!!",10,0,1,30 April 2007
Dreamgirls," A Good Film, But too Many Songs!!!
","Going into 'Dreamgirls' I didn't know what to expect. It has a great cast, great production design, a decent plot,good singers, and only one really major problem. There are too many flashy musical numbers.'Dreamgirls' is all about Motown music. It's very flashy, very over-the-top, and very much over-filled with crowd-pleasing moments. The movie has a lot of deep themes about racism, weight problems, and drug abuse. The problem is, the movie is coated with so much glamor and glitz that these ideas can't really shine through as well as they should.The songs in the movie are very numerous, popping up almost every other second. Some of them are fitting and fun, especially the Jennifer Hudson songs. However, there are a lot of random musical numbers that occur in the middle of conversations. There are also some that seem like out-of-place sickly sweet show-tunes. What saves this film from being destroyed by these ridiculous and lengthy numbers is the star-studded cast.Jennifer Hudson is lovable, sassy, powerful, and heart-driven as Effie White. Her rendition of 'And I am Telling...' is breath-taking. A lot of the people in the theater where I saw the movie were bawling their heads off. Hudson's performance is nicely complimented by Eddie Murphy's over-the-top rendition of Jimmy Early. He should've nabbed the Oscar for his great singing and dancing,as well of his showing of Early's darker side.The funny thing about the acting in this movie is that the two main supporting roles (Murphy and Hudson) overshadow the two leading roles (Foxx and Beyonce). Jamie and Beyonce are both good, but they're acting as overall shallow characters, and have no real connection. Still, this is part of a major theme in the film, and their restrained performances do make sense.Overall, 'DreamGirls' is no 'Chicago', but it is a well-acted and fun piece of work.",6,0,1,5 May 2007
She's the Man," Amanda Steals The Show
","Amanda Bynes has emerged as one of the few former child stars who escapes their past. She obviously has a good career ahead of her, if this film is any indication. Amanda steals the show, as she should, as Viola, a soccer player tom-boy who's team was cut. Distressed by this predicament, Viola is desperate for an opportunity to play and show her skills when her brother Sebastian decides to sneak out of town, asking her to call him in sick at his new school. Obviously, Viola decides to dress up as Sebastian (her twin) and go to school in his place.At school, Viola finds things to be harder than she expected. She finds herself the object of attraction of a hot girl named Olivia, who her other new friend Duke likes, but she needs Duke to help improve her soccer skills, and at the same time she must avoid her brother's evil girl-friend Monique. It's much more simple than it sounds, but it could have been a disaster. Because of Amanda Bynes, it's not.Amanda is perfect at playing the boyish but pretty Viola, but she really shines when playing Viola imitating her brother. She brings a sense of over-the-top-ness and fun to the role while grounding it at the same time. She's one of the great new teen comedians, and I hope to see more of her. Now, about the film.Obviously, there are plot holes and cheesy moments, but it's a teen comedy, so what do you expect? The supporting players range from fair to exceptional, and some of their characters are also very funny. It's sure to make you laugh, and that's all you can ask for with a film like this.7.5/10",8,0,0,1 August 2007
Spider-Man," A Pretty Good Film
","Don't get me wrong. I love Spiderman. I love the comic books, I love the TV show(s), and I like the plot they chose for the film. Still, this is not a masterpiece. it's a good movie that is revealed to be just a good movie when you compare it to its sequel.Sam Raimi and the actors obviously had fun with this film. The camp level is pretty high at parts, and the intensity never seems to be turned on. The CGI is easy to look at, but pales in comparison with either of the film's sequels. There are a lot of things to like about this movie. For instance, Tobey Maguire, Jmaes Franco, and Kirsten Dunst are all very good in their roles. In addition, the location shots are gorgeous, and the whole movie flows in a fun, relaxing manner. This is where we come to the film's major problems.1. It's relaxing. The action never elevates to a level where you actually need to worry about any of the likable characters. The supposedly intense and scary scenes are not very scary or intense at all. Also, the film is too in love with its location to worry about anything else.2. The green Goblin was a terrible villain. The costume was about as cheesy as it possibly could have been, and the voice-overs from the helmet seemed like something out of 'Power Rangers.' Wllem Dafoe is not to blame for this, of course. The scenes with Norman Osborne and no mask are expertly crafted. There simply aren't enough of them.3. The film is boring at parts, and has low replay quality. If I had to watch it more than once in a day, I would probably fall asleep five minutes into it the second time. there's simply not enough action, and the romance isn't developed enough to make it interesting.Overall, 'Spiderman' is a flawed film with a good heart. It's worth a rental, but perhaps not a buy.",6,0,0,4 May 2007
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," The Best Potter Film: Alfonso Delivers
","I had my doubts about this film when I learned that Alfonso Cuaron was to take the director's chair, but they proved to be completely irrational. This film is easily the best of the Potters, excelling in nearly every area. Alfonso brings a new, very spooky quality to the film franchise that was much needed. His new Hogwarts set is perfect for the third film, which was meant to be dark and different. For instance, the pumpkin patch and the 'floating' walkway give off a very mystical and Halloween-ish aura. In addition, Cuaron and the set designers actually reinforced the themes of the film in every aspect. The newly designed gears and clock chime in the castle reinforce time, which is of utmost importance in the film. Also worth mentioning is the overall look of the characters and visuals.The special effects of the third film far surpass those of the first and second, erasing all traces of cheese and campiness. The Whomping Willow scene with Harry and Hermione looks incredibly real, and is very exciting. The dementors are also incredibly creepy looking, which is the perfect effect for them. I also liked what was done with the students themselves. Instead of walking around in their school robes and looking incredibly dorky, Harry, Hermione, and Ron dress and act like normal teens, simply thrust into the wizarding world. Their lines reinforce this as well. I found it especially comical when Hermione sees herself outside of Hagrid's hut, remarking 'Does my hair really look like that from the back?' Overall, this third film is ingenious, blending fantasy spookiness with typical teen behavior. A masterpiece on nearly every level.",10,0,1,26 May 2007
Ratatouille," Another Home Run For Disney/Pixar
","Though I have thoroughly enjoyed every Disney/Pixar film released in past years, some titles stand out more than others in my mind. 'The Incredibles,' for instance is my personal favorite. Still, last summer, when I saw 'Cars' I was not enormously 'wowed' by it. I felt that Disney/Pixar might have been going downhill, and the preview for this film was no thrill. However, I am pleased to say that 'Ratatouille' has brought it back.Unlike its predecessors, 'Ratatouille' does not boast big actors for its voices. Still, I found that this took away nothing from the experience. Instead of puzzling over whose voice each character had, I could sit and simply enjoy the film, which is absolutely terrific. The plot centers around Remy, an adorable rat with extreme culinary talent, who is separated from his family and winds up in Paris, at his idol's restaurant, 'Le Restaurant de Chef Gusteau.' He joins up with Linguini, a garbage boy with no talent in cooking. The two form a secret partnership in which Linguini provides a home and food for Remy, while Remy controls Linguini in the kitchen of the restaurant, cooking up a storm. The result of this madness? It's hilarious and I won't even attempt to describe it.The characters in the story are surprisingly multi-dimensional. Some of my favorites were Colette- a feisty and talented feminist cook, the scheming and treacherous new chef of the restaurant, and others.It's fantastic, and though not the best of the films in its category, it is priceless for all ages. See it!",10,1,2,5 July 2007
Batman Begins," The Best Batman Film Ever: Period
","How did you do it, Christopher Nolan? How in the world did you assemble such a phenomenal cast, such a fantastic crew, and such a good story? 'Batman Begins' brings us back to the beginning of Bruce Wayne's alternate identity, chronicling the early events in the 'life' of Batman.The acting in 'Begins' is superb. Christian Bale looks like Batman should in the suit. He is not too old and slick like George Clooney was, nor is he too gangly and un-cool like the original Batman, Michael Keaton. Still, he is even better at portraying Bruce Wayne. He doesn't play the part over-the-top. Instead, he comes off as a millionaire playboy with not a care in the world, which is what Bruce Wayne really is. He is complimented nicely by Katie Holmes, who is not your typical damsel-in-distress. Michael Caine is brilliant, as usual, as a more likable Alfred than his predecessor. Also worth mentioning is Morgan Freeman, who plays an aging, but still cool helper to Bruce. Still, the show-stealers in this film are the villains.Cillian Murphy is one of the best younger actors in the business, and he hands in an enormously creepy and venomous performance as 'Scarecrow.' He plays the role so well that the audience can almost feel his evil menace pouring out of the screen.At the heart of 'Batman Begins' is what is easily the best plot in the series so far. The film's story is really a two-part storyline, consisting of the 'birth of Batman' and his first major crisis in Gotham. Instead of ridiculous and impossible story lines, this newest film deals a lot with the mind, never actually delving into the impossible. I won't give the highly unpredictable plot away, but I will say that it involves psychological and physical terror, and is somewhat plausible in a way so that there are no moments when one feels inclined to say, 'Oh, come on!' Overall, 'Batman Begins' is really the first step in bringing the series back, better than ever. It is also a great film, and I would recommend it to anyone above the age of 11 or 12, being that it is very creepy at times and has a good deal of violence.8/10",8,1,2,5 June 2007
The Incredibles," Incredible!
","Having started watching Disney films before I was a year old, I can honestly say that I've seen nearly every film Disney has ever released. The original animated Disney films, like 'Beauty and the Beast,' will always have a special place in my heart, and can at this point not be surpassed by many of the new Disney/Pixar animated films. In fact, 'The Incredibles' is the only one of these '3-D' animation films that has achieved classic status in my mind. It's absolutely incredible.'The Incredibles' manages to do everything the other Disney/Pixar films have tried to do at once. It manages to pay homage to the golden age of superheroes, while at the same time poking fun at certain aspects of it and almost grounding the whole superhero concept in reality. It poses the question of what would truly happen if there were superheroes in society, and does so in an interesting and compelling ways. The story is also enormously compelling. It's a superhero plot that avoids every cliché that it wants to and includes the rest in purposeful and funny ways. Still, what sets the film aside other animated films is its characters, which are all enormously clever and creative.The 'Incredible' family is a hilarious and fun superhero family, because they're just like us (except for the powers, which they actually come to loathe). We see a dysfunctional superhero family, which is certainly a first. We also get to see their family friend, Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), who was very 'cool,' if you know what I mean. The villain in the mix is Syndrome, an ambitious child-turned-superhero hater and terrorist. Disney does not handle the film with the normal child quality. Death is not avoided, but rather confronted when Mr. Incredible makes his inevitable strike on the ruthless villain. Syndrome is also perfectly rendered, from his fiery hair down to his maniacal voice. He's extraordinarily intimidating and though funny at times, often shows his purely evil self.The film is funny at times, while serious at others. It has great characters, a unique plot, fantastic animation, a great score, and a hilarious script. I'd recommend it to children above the age of 6 or 7 and even more so to teens and adults who were around during the golden age of superheroes. It's a perfect film.",10,1,1,23 June 2007
Kick-Ass," Smart Satire or Generic Genre Picture?
","'Kick-Ass' sets out to lay waste to the archetypal superhero movie, but some see the film as just another addition to the superhero genre. Those who argue for satire point to the first half of the film, where Aaron Johnson's 'everyman' character learns the hard way that becoming a superhero isn't as easy as it looks in movies like 'Spider-Man' or 'Batman Begins.' You see, Kick-Ass earns a reputation as a superhero, but he lacks the skills of the more covert Hit-Girl and Big Daddy, who lurk in the shadows with high-grade weaponry and martial arts mastery. While Hit-Girl and Big Daddy fight crime, Kick Ass must deal with the everyday plagues of the American teen. In a funny bit, Kick Ass' alter ego, Dave Lizewski, learns that the 'love of his life' wants him to be...well I won't spoil it, but I will say that it stands in the way of Dave's dreams for a little while. Bits like that one enrich the first half of Kick Ass with a dose of funny reality. Kick Ass comes off as kind of a loser, Hit-Girl looks way too young to be saying the things she says (and doing the things she does), and Nicolas Cage's Big Daddy stands as one of his funniest creations. He's like an overbearing Little League parent on steroids. Less funny are the villains. Mark Strong, an excellent actor, must play a fairly bland crime kingpin. He does his best to enliven his character's dialogue, but he still comes across as a cross between 'Daredevil's' Kingpin and 'Iron Man's' Obadiah Stane. This composite villain has an equally bland son, played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse as a dull redux of McLovin. Still, in the first half of the film, these characters only slightly distract from the bold comedy surrounding the protagonists. Unfortunately, as Jackson Browne once sang, 'all god things must come to an end.'The good things in 'Kick-Ass' come to an end when the story begins to embrace the formula it's supposed to be tearing apart. Director Matthew Vaughn abandons humor almost entirely as the film claws its way to a gun-crazy climax. There's nothing funny about a scene in which gangsters kidnap and plan to televise the execution of good, if misguided, characters. Vaughn seems eager to comment on his audience's potentially disturbing fascination with violence. This is clear in the film's first half when Kick-Ass enters a fight with high hopes, only to suffer real consequences. It's similarly clear early in the film, when Hit-Girl dispatches some baddies in gruesome and methodical fashion. Towards the end of the film, however, Vaughn seems to fall into the very trap on which he sought to comment. The encounters toward the end of the film drip with violence, but it's all very stylized. In order to grip the audience, Vaughn employs a type of violence that allows viewers o revel and cheer. This type of violence dominates most genre superhero films (just look t 'Iron Man's' robotic smack-down, or at 'The Incredible Hulk's' creature clash), so I would never expect it from a supposed 'satire' of those films. Generic plot convention after generic plot convention, standard fight scene after standard fight scene, and ridiculous dialogue piece after ridiculous dialogue piece made the second half of Kick-Ass a huge disappointment That said, most of the action is well-shot, the pace still moved along well, and the film's ending has a certain charm to it. 'Kick-Ass' was not the film that it could have been. It starts off satirizing genre superhero movies, but it ends up becoming one. Still, the film works well on the whole. It has an exciting visual style, a number of cackle-worthy comedic bits, and some great hammy performances. It doesn't totally kick ass, but it just might kick butt.",7,2,4,6 August 2010
The Hurt Locker," Great Film-making
","'The Hurt Locker' is a fairly subdued, restrained war film with a brain, which separates it from most films of its genre.Jeremy Renner leads the cast as James, the new front-man of a bomb squad in Iraq. He takes risks and defies the standard mold, which puts him at odds with 'teammates' Sanborn and Eldridge. The plot's spotlight shines on the various missions of these three men; each mission is its own exhilarating set-piece.Director Bigelow explores James' complex attitudes towards his job through lingering close-ups. She captures the intensity of the situations through a variety of different shots and artistic techniques. The film immerses the audience in the conflict without extensive dialogue.Jeremy Renner leads the cast with a pitch-perfect performance, and Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty lend invaluable support, along with great bits from veteran actors Guy Pearce, David Morse, and Ralph Fiennes.There's nothing simple about the characters of situations in 'The Hurt Locker,' and the film-makers don't try to dumb down the material or take a polarizing stand. The film is a work of art; it entertains and enlightens.",10,2,13,17 January 2010
The Illusionist," A Slight Misfire, but Fine
","'The Illusionist' is not really bad, nor is it really good, setting it aside form the far superior 'The Prestigfe.' The performances are good, and the leading actors show us just how much fun they had making the film. Paul Giamatti is especially brilliant as Chief Inspector Ool. His accent is purposefully comical, and he brings the much-needed fun factor to the film. Ed Norton and Jessica Biel are given very little to do dramatically, but they do it just fine.The real problem is that the film is not particularly interesting. The plot is very typical and dull at times, involving an arranged marriage, a wicked prince, a poor lover, doomed love, and a police investigation. The end, which I will not reveal, is also a disappointment. A word to the creators: there does not need to be a logical explanation for everything. Some mysteries are better left unsolved.Still, 'The Illusionist' has its kicks. Some scenes have a fittingly magical quality, the costumes are terrific, the set pieces are fitting and enchanting, and the Oscar-nominated cinematography is beautifully golden and crisp. It's a good film, but lacks greatness. Still, I would recommend it for the fun performances and beautiful look of the film.",6,0,0,2 July 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Fantastic Fun!
","When the first 'Spiderman' film was released, it received general approval but some negative reviews,due especially to uneven effects, amateur acting, and cheesy design. However, out of the rubble emerged 'spiderman 2,' a film that remains as one of the best super-hero adaptations of all time. It far surpassed the original, learning from its mistakes and cleaning up some of the cheesiness. When 'Fantastic Four' was released, it was met mainly with disapproval and rather bad reviews, which it deserved. The effects were very cheesy, the villain was third-rate, the plot was ridiculous, the script was horrid, and the film dragged on. Luckily, 'Silver Surfer' has pulled a 'Spiderman 2' on us. Though not as good as 'Spiderman 2,' it far surpasses the level of the original.The acting in 'Silver Surfer' is far from perfect, but it's certainly passable and is extraordinarily unimportant in the film. Chris Evans brings the spirit of fun to the film, Jessica Alba brings the 'hot' factor, and the silver surfer brings the excitement and bewilderment. The special effects in the film are dazzling and not at all hokey. The silver surfer looks amazing, the human torch looks the way he should, and Galactus, though hardcore fans of the comics may be enormously disappointed, has been stripped of the cheesiness he had in the comics. He's no longer a giant man in purple, but rather an astrological whirlwind of power. The plot of this sequel is also very good. The run time of the picture is short, so the script is beneficially tight and the plot doesn't get old. Also, there is no room for cheesy sub-plots. This is a great, fun movie that people of all ages will enjoy.",8,4,8,19 June 2007
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," There's Good and There's Bad
","'Good Night, and Good Luck' is a good film. The thing that is bothersome is that it could have been a great film, given a bit of tweaking.'Good Night, and Good Luck' is a deceptive film. From the commercials and advertising campaign, you would think that it was a film about the fight to bring down the dreadful McCarthy. You'd be wrong. This is not a film about McCarthyism and its collapse, but rather about television at the time of the before-mentioned collapse. George Clooney's messages in this film are mostly about censorship and the corruption involved in major TV stations. This is actually the film's biggest flaw.The best parts of the film are the times when we are able to see the slightly doctored broadcasts that brought McCarthy down. David Strathairn's impeccable performance spruces these interesting segments up. The rest of the film is what keeps it from greatness.Throughout the film, we are forced to view the unimportant and dull conflicts that the other characters in the story are going through. These take us away from the interesting McCarthy sub-plot and bring us towards the boring moral tales about the television industry. George Clooney's acting makes these side-stories even more dull and less authentic. Unlike the other major actors and actresses in the film, Clooney acts very casually, as if the film were supposed to take place in the 2000s rather than the 1950s. Still, Strathairn's performance and the documentary segments make this film good.",7,0,0,4 May 2007
Shrek 2," Better than the First
","The first Shrek film was well-liked by most because it satyred fairy tales in a fun way, while keeping a good story and good special effects. The characters were fresh and original, and the voice-acting was top-notch. Still, the film had some serious kinks and became almost bland. The sequel learns from the mistakes of the first films and eliminates them while going a step further than the first film.In 'Shrek 2', we find Shrek and Fiona living happily in the swamp while enjoying the relaxing life of being married, apart from the constant badgering of Donkey, who is all the more hilarious in this second installment. Pretty soon, Shrek and Fiona are requested to go off and visit Fiona's parents in the 'Land of Far, Far, Away'. The set-up is priceless. We get similar spoofing of fairy tales all throughout the film, including stabs at Prince Charming, the 'Fairy god-mother', the little mermaid (briefly), the frog prince, and thousands of others. The plot is much more well-thought out and original this time, and the story pokes fun at modern society and film, as well as the same kind of bits from the original. For instance, Far Far Way is the home of its very own News Team, some of the assistants of the Fairy Godmother complain about lack of insurance, and Starbucks locations are everywhere! These are only some of the many funny satirical bits in this film.What really makes 'Shrek 2' the best in the series however, is that it balances all of its parts perfectly. The soundtrack is superb, the modern satirical bits are hilarious, the characters are all unique in their own way, and the plot is decent at worst, but in the hands of the wrong person this could have all meant nothing. It does. The film is a gem, better even for teens than for children. It is a flawless satire with fantastic animation and voice acting.",9,0,1,2 June 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," 'I Must Not Tell Lies...'
","It's phenomenal. David Yates brings 'Order of the Phoenix' to life with the same dark humor and amazing scope that Alfonso Cuaron used so memorably with 'Prisoner of Azkaban.' He has brought the franchise back on track after a misfired fourth film with a delightful but often creepy mix of fantastic effects, stellar performances, and fresh dialogue.'Order' moves at a rapid pace, Yates having removed the duller scenes from the book, and it fits very well. as Yates himself said, for as long as the book is, it condenses very nicely. Still, this has been a problem for many fans of the novels who seem to have found too many cut scenes from the book. I have grown up with the 'Potter' book series, and was vastly disappointed with the parts cut from the last film. For 'Order' however, the cuts made seem to have enhanced the film rather than hindered it. In fact, some of the parts missing are barely noticeable for even the biggest fans of the novels (myself included) due in large part to some of the performances.When judging an actor or actress in their portrayal of a book character, I too often find myself judging for appearance (does he/she match what I pictured). Instead, for this film I simply judged them based on whether or not they evoked the same emotions in me as they did in the book. I'll start with the highlights of the cast. Evanna Lynch is perfect as the misty Luna Lovegood, delivering her lines in a chilling, yet comical manner. Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Gary Oldman, Jason Isaacs, and Emma Thompson all reprise their roles very well too. Even Helena Bonham-Carter shows up as the maniacal Bellatrix Lestrange, acting in a pitch-perfect manner that only she could obtain, not to mention the fact that her makeup and costuming is perfect.Still, the best performance in the film is Imelda Staunton's portrayal of the real villain in the story.Ms. Staunton plays Dolores Umbridge, Harry's sinister new teacher. Her scenes are all immensely funny due to her crazy hilarious range, but she still manages to be quite real and very frightening. She deserves a Best Supporting Actress nod at the Academy Awards. Unfortunately, not all of the performances are quite as good, though they don't really hurt the film.The only truly bad performance in the film is that of Katie Leung as Cho Chang. She delivers her lines very oddly, and never manages to be sympathetic. For those of you who have seen the third 'Godfather' film, her performance is very reminiscent of Sofia Coppola's. Luckily, she doesn't have enough screen time for it to be a problem. Michael Gambon plays Albus Dumbledore, and he certainly has the vigorous inner strength that he is supposed to have in the books, but unlike Richard Harris, he can't be soft and gentle. He is always forceful and commandeering. Nonetheless, he does fine in 'OOTP,' considering the fact that most of his softer moments with Harry have been removed. Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint are fine at conveying the simple emotions, such as anger and intense happiness. Unfortunately, they don't have a lot of dramatic range. As Harry, Dan over-acts or under-acts whenever he has to show a subtle emotion. For this reason, he comes off as an overly emotional teen throughout the film. Rupert is not a bad actor, but he's given very strange lines to say, and he says some of them in a rather corny way. Emma Wason is more talented than either of these actors, but she's not given enough to do. Still, these performances don't damage the film. They simply keep it from being even better than it already is.The technical aspects of 'OOTP' are incredible. The cinematography shows immense skill and depth, and the film is filled with dark and misty tones, just like the mood of the novel. The art direction is also amazing, perfectly capturing the tone of different scenes. 'Order' has a lot to serve in terms of visuals, but it's really more about the story. Though the campus has never looked better, the thestrals look very real, Fred and George's fireworks display is awesome,and the dementors are disturbing, the film is not a visual gimmick. It's a story about adolescence, early romances, corruption, and governmental stupidity. It's really quite amazing.",9,0,2,19 July 2007
Blood Diamond," Great Performances + Compelling Plot = Good Film
","In 'Blood Diamond,' Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Danny Archer, a South African diamond smuggler. He comes to Sierra Leone in search of a conflict diamond that can pay off his debt with his vile employer. Djimon Hansou plays Solomon Vandy, a black African whose son was taken by rebel forces and who hopes to retrieve a large conflict diamond he found when in custody. These two men find themselves fighting alongside one another to survive in 'Blood Diamond.' Characters/Plot: 8/10 This is no 'Godfather,' but the characters are very interesting because they are all so flawed in different ways and have mixed motives. Danny Archer is a great likable anti-hero and Solomon is incredibly strong as a character. The plot also moves at a good pace, and it always keeps you guessing as to what will happen next.Acting: 9/10 Leonardo DiCaprio is flawless as Danny Archer. His accent is perfect and his mannerisms are so precise and believable. He is sowing himself to be the best younger male actor working. Djimon Hansou is also great, adding a bit more roughness and determination to his similar role in 'In America.' Jennifer Connelly is perfect as an attractive reporter. The casting is great all around, and even the supporting characters seem to fit in well.Technical: 10/10 The cinematography, sound editing, sound mixing, and visual effects are all pitch-perfect. The camera moves very smoothly at times and more roughly at others. The sounds and visuals are also brutally realistic.Atmosphere: 6/10 The atmosphere of the film is great at times but at other times falters. Though the yellow and orange color use is very effective in parts, it sometimes glamorizes the scenes rather than makes them real. In 'Hotel Rwanda,' there is always that sense of desperation and realism, but here it only appears at certain times, and would be appropriate if used more often. The score was also not incredibly strong, and seemed to fail at manipulating emotion in any way.Entertainment: 7/10 'Blood Diamond' is not incredibly well edited. I have no problem with long films, but I don'yet know that this one needed a 2 and a half hour run-time. It seems a bit long at times and some of the intensity seems to falter and drop off at certain points. Still, the battle scenes are exhilarating and the story is very interesting. 'Blood Diamond' works best when it is at its most intense points.Final Score: A- 8/10 (40/50)",8,2,2,3 August 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," An 'Eternally' Smart Film
","'Eternal Sunshine' is one of the rare films that actually overcomes its flaws completely and makes itself into a great film without dishing everything out to the audience. There's no real format to the film. It jumps from place to place, often confusing the viewer for a moment, but creating a unique and rewarding experience.The acting in the film is great across the board. Jim Carrey gives a very good, but not quite Oscar-caliber turn as Joel, a quiet writer whose dull nature destroys any true fun in his relationships. Kate Winslet plays Clementine, an impulsive and energetic woman whose hair color is constantly changing as her relationship with Joel does. Winslet is really the shining star in the film. She is beautiful, vibrant, and full of life, bringing an edge to the film. It's truly a shame she wasn't put in the Supporting Actress section of the Oscars, where she could have had a win. Elijah Wood is annoying as usual, but he's playing an annoying character so it's passable. Tom Wilkinson is very good as the doctor behind the whole experiment that is the basis of the film, and Kirsten Dunst is surprisingly fantastic in a small role as the doctor's secretary. The plot itself is fantastic, truly delving into the mind and memories of Joel. Carrey is a little over the top at times, but he still moves through the film well with help from the leading lady. This is an extraordinary, Oscar-nomination worthy film, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a smart film that is also funny and dramatic at times.",10,2,4,11 June 2007
Avatar," You've Seen It All Before
","If you like heavy-handed metaphors, laughable dialogue, and predictable plots, you'll love 'Avatar,' auteur James Cameron's latest creation.Technically, 'Avatar' is a blend of Cameron's past efforts. Like 'The Abyss,' it taps into the supernatural qualities of nature. Like 'T2,' it captures humanoids visually using innovative special effects. Like 'Titanic,' it juxtaposes a Romeo/Juliet-type romance with chaos and destruction. Unfortunately, while those three films are great, 'Avatar' is not.James Cameron has never shied away from foreshadowing. Every one of his films builds suspense through eerie happenings, musical cues, and suspicious dialogue early on. 'Avatar' takes foreshadowing to a new level. Early on, characters literally say what is going to happen for the rest of the film. You could easily outline the entire plot about twenty minutes into the movie. Obvious parallels are drawn early on between the Na'vi (the blue humanoids) and the Native Americans, with the greedy white invaders standing in for....well....greedy white invaders. Then you get the obligatory environmentalists, as well as the morally conflicted protagonist. The plot proceeds as you would imagine. I won't spoil it, but as I said, it basically spoils itself. In fact, it bears a lot in common with Disney's 'Atlantis,' a much better film.Even with a hackneyed plot, one would expect that the great James Cameron could weave a great film through effects, actors, and plot tweaking. The plot rarely wavers from that which is expected. While plot twists are obnoxious in most cases nowadays, one or two would've been welcome here- so long as they weren't outlandish.As for the acting, it's not bad. Sam Worthington's Australian accent seems out of place, but he puts in solid work as the subdued paraplegic protagonist. He struggles with the daily video diary entry scenes, but these are simply plot devices on Cameron's part to inject narration. Some of the supporting players are real stand-outs. Giovanni Ribisi provides comic relief as the mostly apathetic corporate representative on board. His character serves no purpose other than to provide laughs, but he manages to steal a few scenes with his dead-pan delivery. Sigourney Weaver is very good as the ship's leading scientist. She molds a complex-seeming character out of one that was surely flat on paper. The cast's best performance comes from Stephen Lang as the grisled colonel. The character is a cliché, but Lang allows the audience to relate to his perspective.Visually, the film is very pretty. The world certainly looks real, the blue people move about smoothly, and the battle scenes look convincing. What's lacking is visual flourish. The Na'vi look off-putting and somewhat stupid, and their strange screaming does nothing to dispel this. The creatures on which they fly look like something straight out of 'Star Wars Episode III,' and the same could be said of the lush tree-centered environment. The choreography of the battle scenes is also mostly weak. It doesn't raise adrenaline so much as it numbs the viewer.On the whole, 'Avatar' is derivative plot-wise and lacking in style and novelty visually. However, some solid performances and a few visual master-strokes make it an average movie, rather than a bad one.",3,2,7,2 January 2010
Up," 'It will lift you up where you belong.'
","So here we are, 17 years after the release of 'An Officer and a Gentleman,' and it appears that the tagline for that 'tropically sexy military drama' has found, in Pixar's 'Up,' a film that suits it all the better. Pixar films have always been noted for their deep themes and profound focuses, ranging in the past from creative passion to the curse of celebrity, but never before has a Pixar film had the guts to take on love in all its many forms. 'Up' opens with a scene of young Carl, our protagonist-to-be, dreaming of adventures to South America's Paradise Falls with renowned explorer Charles Muntz, who has lost his reputation in the eyes of the cruelly skeptical scientific community. Young Carl meets young Ellie, a fellow Muntz devotee, and the rest is history, illustrated through an emotional roller coaster of a montage stands as one of the most powerful ever committed to screen. It captures the spirit of marital love, illustrating that romantic love is more responsible for happiness than any material possession. As this montage ends, the film's main plot begins.Fortunately, the rest of 'Up' stays afloat even after beginning on such a high-flying note. The plot is unpredictable and has a number of shocking moments, so I'll say just this. Russell, Carl's incidental friend, forms a platonic relationship with Carl that is truly touching and illustrates a whole new type of love. Like the opening montage, the payoff of this relationship is emotionally powerful and real at the same time. While one or two of Russell's lines about his family ring false, these do very little to puncture the film. In fact, they are completely canceled out by the inclusion of some funny canine humor and by the introduction of who is one of Pixar's best and most complex villains yet. Mum's the word on this one.All in all, as that very different 1982 film's tagline suggests, 'Up' will lift you up where you belong with its poignant examination of love and its thrilling storyline.",10,0,2,19 June 2009
Invincible," Uninspired and Uninspiring
","From the time I saw the first preview for 'Invincible,' I was very excited to see it. I loved 'Remember the Titans,' and this seemed to be that kind of movie: a sports film with a good cast that alters the mold and tries something new and interesting. Perhaps this is the reason that 'Invincible' proved to be such a disappointment for me.Mark Wahlberg stars in the film as Vince Papale, an underdog who rises from the streets of Philadelphia and becomes an Eagle. His performance is completely flat. Not only does he not try to give his character life, but he is not even likable. Sorry, Mark, but no Oscar nod for this one! As for his football story, it proves to be enormously dull. The sequences follow the usual Disney sports movie mold, never breaking free in a single area. Greg Kinnear, who is typically fantastic, struggles to give Coach Dick Vermielle some actual personality and character. He wants us to sympathize with him, but he comes off as simply pathetic. The lifeless football story never even comes off the ground. The final game scene is anti-climactic, involving Vince making an unimportant play that means nothing.The romantic aspect of the film is even worse. Elizabeth Banks plays Vince's love interest, who he marries after the end of the film. She tries doing a New York accent for about five minutes, before abruptly switching to her normal voice. Her performance itself is bland and vapid, like the rest of the film.Still, I understand that some people really like this film. I can honestly say that I didn't. If you're a huge sports fan and care little about bad acting and boring slow-motion shots, you'll probably like it. If you're looking for a good-quality film with an exciting plot, you'll hate it.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The Worst Harry Potter Film
","Let me start by saying that I did enjoy watching 'Goblet of Fire.' Unfortunately, it was still the worst of the four first Harry Potter films.The fourth film takes place during Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts. The basic premise is this. The Hogwarts school is hosting a tournament called the Triwizard tournament, along with two other schools. Harry is mysteriously chosen as a fourth competitor, and must compete in three daunting tasks to win the tournament. At the same time, Voldemort is slowly gaining power, leading up to a confrontation between Harry and him at the climax of the film. Here are the problems with this could-be masterpiece.1. No Quidditch: About ten minutes into the film, when the trio and the Weasley's sit down in their seats at the Quidditch World Cup, I suddenly got very excited. The Cup was the highlight of the book, and I was finally going to see it on screen! Unfortunately, the scene stops abruptly before the Cup begins, which was very angering and made the first part of the film seem - well - not as good.2. No Magical Score: Unlike the first three films, the musical score of 'Goblet' is bl;and and unoriginal. John Williams created the real magic in the first two films with his enchanting Hedwig's Theme, and the composer of music for the third film gave it a very different and spooky quality. The music in this film is terrible, making the magical quality much less intact.3. Cheesy Lines: the script for 'Goblet' is full of lines that made me want to cringe. In the first three films, bad lines were somewhat acceptable due to the innocence of the children. However, they are now too old to be staying ridiculous and stupid things.These, among others, are the reasons that 'Goblet' is my least favorite Potter film. Still, the fifth seems enormously promising and the film is not so bad that it cannot be redeemed.",5,3,5,26 May 2007
The Fountain," A Fountain of Artistic Mastery
","Aronofsky is an artist, and 'The Fountain' is his latest masterpiece. It's a work of art and a film at the same time, and the art element of it deserves a perfect score, while the film aspect deserves probably an eight star score.'The Fountain' tells three parallel stories in no particular order, often melding them together. The core story is the tale of Tommy (Hugh Jackman), a determined scientist who tries desperately to find a cure for his wife Izzy (Rachel Weisz), who has a serious case of cancer. Izzy is almost finished writing a novel called 'The Fountain.' the plot of this novel is the second story, which takes place in Span in the 1500s, and chronicles the journey of a conquistador named Tomas (Jackman) to find the Fountain of Youth. He does this in the service of the lovely Queen Isabella (Weisz). The last story takes place in the distant future, in which an astronaut (Jackman) journeys to the dying star Xi'balba in a bubble in an attempt to save the lovely dying tree that inhabits the bubble alongside him.Jackman is very restrained in his three roles, but he still gives a very solid and realistic performance. He allows the audience to tune in on hi desperation and feel it with him. Weisz is beautiful and puts in a grade-A performance, selling us with her irresistible charm and tangible affection. Still, the real star of the film is the look and feel.The visual effects used in the space scenes are beautiful and entrancing. The subtle ones used in the other two stories are not at all cheesy, but rather express the desired feelings of the characters. The art direction and set direction are breath-takingly gorgeous. The set pieces are all masterworks in themselves, and the nature scenes and bubble sequences are beautiful as well. The entire film is rich in earthy colors which complement the themes in the film well. Aronofsky also includes minor motifs everywhere.This film is beautiful and amazing. The plots are brilliantly rendered, the sets are amazing, and the effects are very good. This is a great film that is also incredibly deep and insightful.",9,2,4,16 June 2007
The Departed," Not a Bad Film, But Overrated
","Over the years, Scorsese has delivered more American classics than any other director. From 'Taxi Driver' to 'The Aviator,' he has always turned in fantastic work. The question is, is the 'Departed' fantastic, or is it simply good? I would go with the latter.If there's one thing that has put a serious dent on the quality of thrillers, it's the cell phone. Instead of a heated chase in which the two men have nowhere to turn, the chased man can now simply call for support on his phone. Suspenseful and intense? Not so much. As far as thrillers go, 'The Departed' is a good one. The characters are interesting, the plot moves quickly, and the acting is fantastic.Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon both turn in exceptional performances as a sheep in a land filled with wolves and a wolf in sheep's clothing. DiCaprio should have been nominated for an Oscar for his role as the constantly bad luck-ridden Billy. Damon also sets the tone right for the most part as Colin, though I feel that he should have made the role a bit more likable.The best performance in the film belongs to Jack Nicholson, who plays an intense crime boss with a dirty mouth, eyes like a hawk, and power like that of no other man. It surprises me that he received no nominations, when his work in the film was potent and frighteningly brutal. He deserved the nomination much more than Mark Wahlberg, who does little more than strut around and talk in a thick accent.These great performers, along with Alec Baldwin and Martin sheen, make the film very entertaining. The script suits the actors well, and is often quite funny. Still, this film is never elevated to the level that Scorsese's past films have been. It is a good movie, and I understand that the Oscar was more of a tribute to Scorsese's career, but the film does not quite measure up as a classic in my book. Better luck next time, Marty.",8,1,2,1 May 2007
Psycho," The Best Hitchcock
","'Psycho' has held a well-deserved spot in my top five favorite films of all time, and I have no doubt that it will stay there forever. It's got everything you could ask for in a movie of its type. 'Psycho' is extraordinarily scary, especially for an older film. The B & W cinematography is enchanting and very creepy. Hitchcock sure knows how to shoot a movie and surround himself with the right people.The acting in 'Psycho' is also amazing. Anthony Perkins is beyond creepy as the multi-dimensional Norman Bates. Janet Leigh portrays the flawed damsel part perfectly, and she brings a great strength to the role.I won't give the story's plot details so as not to spoil anything, but I will say that it is both incredibly compelling and strangely disturbing. There's a strong psychological aspect that gives the film a whole other dimension. You can watch it for the chills, the thrills, the themes, or all of the above. If you can only see one Hitchcock movie in your lifetime, let this be the one.",10,0,0,13 August 2007
The Holiday," A Holiday to Visit the Devil
","I had no real expectations for this film. I've seen more than enough romantic comedies to recognize that this one would be an over-the-top, sickly sweet film. However, nothing could have prepared me for the horror that awaited me in the form of this film.Picture an enormous chocolate cake filled with rich raspberry filling. Now, picture yourself getting ready to take a nibble when BAM! The entire cake is stuffed into your mouth, leaving you to try and digest it as you feel yourself getting sick. Now, picture this lasting over two hours. you've just experienced 'The Holiday.' This film has so many problems and so little value that I hardly know where to begin. The basic story is as follows.In California, we have Amanda, played by Cameron Diaz. She's a wretched and obnoxious woman who scares away her boyfriend at the beginning of the film when she finds that he cheated on her. At this point, we're supposed to sympathize with her. This is impossible. Cameron Diaz overplays it so much that you half-expect her to explode five minutes into her introduction. On the other side of the globe, we have Iris. she's a sweet British reporter who is trying to escape from a past relationship with Jasper, a nasty man who abuses his position mercilessly. When Iris finds that Jasper is engaged, she immediately goes home and finds herself switching lives with Amanda for a little while. Sounds corny? Well, it is.The rest of the film goes on slowly, miserably, and with side-plots galore. Amanda meets Graham (Jude Law), and the bad acting done for both characters makes their scenes vomit-worthy. Iris, however, who is played by Kate Winslet, has a genuine goodness about her. If we spent more time with her character and less with Cmaeron's, this movie could have been better. But, alas, it does not.The film goes on for entirely too long, and is ridiculously decorated with strange and improbable pieces of dialogue. it's an awful film that I would not recommend to anyone except the most romanticized teen girls.",2,6,13,1 May 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," A Waste of Talent:
","Let me start by saying hat 'Stranger Than Fiction' is an awful movie. Period. The worst thing about it is not the plot, which is admittedly dull and drawn out. It is not the art direction and cinematography, which is still very plain and unoriginal. Nor is it the title, which is somewhat fitting in a strange sort of way. Though these things are not enormously positive, the worst part of 'Stranger than Fiction' is the blatant way in which it wastes the talents of its capable cast and produces such a terrible final product.'Stranger than Fiction' is the story of the life of Harold Crick, played by Will Ferrel. Crick lives an enormously dull life, and Will Ferrel can do little more than make him a somewhat likable, but intensely boring person. Was this the intent? I don't know, nor do I care. Watching the events of Crick's life play out, which we spend the entire movie doing, as about as dull and unoriginal as it sounds. The role is such a waste of Ferrel's talent. We see this problem a lot in the movie.We soon switch between Crick and Emma Thompson's character in the movie, a best-selling author who's writing a book with Crick as the main character. Emma Thompson gives the writer such a soporific quality that she is even more unbearable to watch than Ferrel himself.The other main characters to come out of the woodwork in the film are a tax-evader who falls for Crick (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a coffee-hounding scholar (Dustin Hoffman), and a boring publishing executive (Qujeen Latifah). None of these characters are remotely interesting except for Hoffman's, who is brought to life well by the veteran actor (no surprise there). The usually wonderful Gyllenhaal is lacking in every area except for gross-out humor (unintentional), when she and Ferrell...-well I won't ruin it for you.This film is an overrated piece of trash that is as ridiculous as any comedy of its mold.",4,1,3,26 May 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Best Prequel
","The Star Wars franchise has brought back the magic of the Star Wars series with 'Revenge of the Sith.' How does it do this? It simply learns from the mistakes of the past two films.One of the major flaws of the first and second prequels was the acting. Though Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Ian McDiarmid gave phenomenal performances, there good work was foiled by Jake Lloyd, Hayden Christensen, and especially Natalie Portman. Though the film does not cut Natalie Portman out of the film, which would have been rather awkward, her screen time is cut down considerably. Christensen still struggles as Anakin, but his work in this film is not quite as consistently bad, and he does a very adequate job turning evil.Ewan McGregor steals the show in terms of acting, capturing the agility of his character's proposed age, as well as the calm wisdom of Alec Guiness, who originated the role and was nominated for an Oscar for it. He is actually given the best storyline, which involves an eventual confrontation with an infamous new villain, General Greivous.The storyline of this film rivals the original trilogy in quality, involving multiple layers of betrayal and distrust. The film takes way a bit of the politics that stuffed the second film, and replaces some of it with true suspense.Of course, the real savior of the film is Yoda. Yoda's foreshadowed duel with the Emperor is absolutely breath-taking, and does explain a lot about Yoda's character.Still, what this film has at its core that neither of the other prequels had is emotion. I felt very sad that the series was over after the end of the film, actually craving more. Still, it left me very content and is truly a great film.",10,1,2,30 May 2007
Inception," What Dreams May Come...
","For all its flaws (and there are some), 'Inception' succeeds as a star-studded blockbuster with a brain. Christopher Nolan has, yet again, crafted a work that manages to inspire both thought and awe: a rare feat, to be sure. As the film opens, the audience is thrown mercilessly into a scene of cascading schemes and chaotic confrontations. We, as audience members, feel uneasy; we don't know exactly where we stand on the characters or the situation at hand, and that's the way Nolan wants it (talk about 'in medias res'). By the time the first wave of tension subsides, another approaches in its wake. This new wave proves to be a tsunami; as the plot unfolds, revelations spring free, character motives come into question, and the film's dream world expands exponentially. The plot of 'Inception,' without giving anything away, goes something like this. Leonardo DiCaprio's Cobb, a sort of 'dream thief,' takes on one final assignment, courtesy of Ken Wantanabe's corporate kingpin. Cobb assembles a team, ranging from Joseph Gordon- Levitt's crafty pretty-boy to Ellen Page's boyish architect. Things get a little crazy as the mission proceeds (certain characters just might be holding back some important information), and a nail-biting spectacle takes the stage.I don't know how much Christopher Nolan was paid for this screenplay, but I can guarantee that it wasn't enough. The story examines the very nature of dreams; it explores their nuances, their limitations, and their possibilities, while at the same time exploring some of the science behind them. When characters have to choose between their dream worlds and reality, we have to consider which option we would embrace. When characters leap from layer to layer, we consider our own dream complexes. At the same time, a serpentine heist film unfolds on screen. While the plot does require the occasional suspension of disbelief, it plays by its own rules for the greater part of its running time.In fact, most of 'Inception's' shortcomings have nothing to do with the plot. Apart from a few over-explained monologues at inappropriate times, the script succeeds ferociously. However, some problems arise with the characters and their actor counterparts. While Leonardo DiCaprio's performance doesn't hit the wrong notes, it doesn't always hit the right ones either. DiCaprio has a compelling voice and look, especially early in the film, but trouble brews when the emotional turmoil strikes his character. Rather than reach for new dramatic heights, he settles for simply adequate deliveries. As such, it becomes difficult to invest in his character as anything more than 'Man 1.' Some other talents in the cast, while solid, are given too little to do. Ellen Page is reduced to the classic 'angel on my shoulder' stereotype, and Tom Berenger and Cillian Murphy are just asked to look concerned for most of the film's duration. Still, Joseph Gordon Levitt looks spiffy, Tom Hardy makes great comic relief, and no one does all too poorly. All in all, 'Inception' makes for a great time at the theater. It sparks conversation, it moves briskly, and it looks brilliant on the big screen. If Hamlet were to see the dreams put on display here, he might just have shuffled off that mortal coil.",8,3,5,30 July 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Bloody Brilliant!
","'Sherlock Holmes' is part-comedy, part-thriller, part-romance, and part-buddy movie. It is also completely brilliant.The film's plot concerns a mysterious plot by the menacing Lord Blackwood. Holmes (Downey Jr.), Watson (Law), and an alluring past love interest (McAdams) must work together- sometimes reluctantly- to crack the case. It sounds simple, but a number of ominous supporting players and adrenaline-inspiring set pieces make it constantly entertaining and riveting.The perpetually likable Robert Downey Jr. takes up the torch as Sherlock Holmes. There's no need to compare his work to that of Basil Rathbone- the two performances could not be more different. Downey Jr. makes Holmes both comedic and competent. His accent is convincing, and his delivery is as dead-pan as ever. In Guy Ritchie's revisionist take, Holmes has become a comic action hero, and Downey Jr. pulls off both the comedy and the action seamlessly. Jude Law lends great support as Watson; his take on the character is more traditional, but he makes a great comedic straight-man as well. McAdams also does well as an American femme fatale whose allegiances are always in question.Stylistically, the film combines Ritchie's 'guns-blazing' sensibilities with period detail and witty dialogue. The quick-cut shots and fast-paced visual flashbacks/explanations suit the source material surprisingly well. The musical score is effectively creepy; it evokes the air of the Rathbone films and the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle novels. Similarly, the costumes and art direction capture the time period, and arrest the audience visually. The script is chock-full of funny lines, and the cast delivers them well.While purists may shudder at the sight of Sherlock in the boxing arena, Ritchie's 'Holmes' is fun, fast-paced, and fresh. Case closed.",10,4,8,16 January 2010
WALL·E," A Well-Compacted Bunch of Trash
","At what point do homage and tribute pass into the realm of reprehensible theft and unoriginality? Director Andrew Stanton answers this question with ham-handed blows to the mind and body with his critical darling, 'Wall-E,' which might as well have been called 'Short Circuit meets *Apple' if not for the pack of other Sci-Fi films from which this one has swiped plot points, characters, vehicles, shots, and so forth.As the film opens, we are greeted by a sweeping shot of Earth in ruins as a sweeping showtune sweeps us away. Yet, despite all this sweeping, enormous clouds of dust manage to dominate every frame, diminishing the grandness of the vision for the sake of reality. This nonetheless jolly first moment leads into a similarly jolly first half for the film, laced with a lovely affair between WallE, who recalls a Windows 95PC, and the stunning Eve, a walking, or rather hovering, advertisement that must have made Steve Jobs proud. While Thomas Newman's score manages nothing more than to sound like every other Thomas Newman score, it's easy to get wrapped up in the Chaplin-esquire love story. Undoubtedly, 'Wall-E' has a first half to die for, or at least to fork up $10. Unfortunately, things go downhill.The second half, rather than making the first seem good by comparison, is in fact so unbearable as to cancel out much of the power of the opening. Attempting to tackle hefty environmental issues and to inspire change in humanity's current behavior, Stanton and company utilize poorly rendered animated humans, voiced badly and put through a hideous subplot in which a blander version of 2001's HAL opposes the changes desired by the unbelievably earnest 'Captain' of a spacecraft taken right off the shelves of the 'Dune' series. Rather than simply hinting at the film's weighty moral, the film-makers actually introduce lines of dialogue that spell it out, later illustrating the implications thereof with an animated vision of Earth's future when better care is applied.Fortunately, 'Wall-E' saves itself from the dreaded 1/5 rating by virtue of the fact that the love story is given at least some screen time during the dregs of the film's finale.",4,4,10,18 June 2009
The Blind Side," The Curious Case of the Hollywood Treatment
","'The Blind Side' isn't awful, as some critics are writing. It's also not terrific, as some viewers are saying. It's a mediocre movie with moments of greatness.As a Baltimore resident, I love to see the Ravens logo emblazoned on screen. Michael Ohers strikes me as both a respectable player and a respectable man. His story is an inspiring one; Ohers rose from poor circumstances and became a national figure. But this isn't the story you get when you put your $10 in the ticket slot, buy your buttery popcorn, and sit down in your sticky seat at the local cinema.'The Blind Side' is essentially about a dumb, poor, black man who finds salvation at the hands of a sassy white woman. Clearly, this is not the story of Michael Ohers. I'm not accusing the Hollywood producers responsible for the film of racism, but rather of opportunism. They obviously decided that this sports story would be best served as a Sandra Bullock movie, complete with 'comedic' stock characters and 'humorously' ironic situations.These Bullock-pampering comic scenes are then juxtaposed with clearly exaggerated and dramatized serious scenes. The effect is an uneven dramedy with some thudding jokes and some unintentional laughs. Toby Keith and Kathy Bates don't bring much to the table as Bullock's husband and Michael's teacher. However, the film doesn't completely collapse.Sandra Bullock gives one of the best performances of her career. With a game Southern accent and a tough-as-nails attitude, she turns a stereotype into a flesh-and-blood character. Her comedic timing has always been good, and it works especially well here. At the same time, she brings gravitas to her character's more trying moments. Bullock carries the film. While her character's role in Ohers' life is overplayed, her work saves the film from the 'DUD' label.Some of the comedy falls flat, Ohers comes off as a wholly dependent idiot, and the film's realism is shaky at times. Still, it's worth seeing the film for Bullock's performance.",5,11,19,16 January 2010
Music and Lyrics," A Pleasant Surprise
","Let me begin by saying that 'Music and Lyrics' is by no means an Oscar-caliber film in any way. However, it is a charming and rather humorous film that both girls and guys can find something to like in. Hugh Grant is (for once) perfectly cast as Alex Fletcher, an 80s 'has-been' who is asked by a hot young pop star, Cora, to write a song for the two of them to sing. After having a failed meeting with a professional lyricist, Alex enlists the help of a young 'substitute plant lady,' played by Drew Barrymore, who turns out to be a born lyricist. His music and her lyrics meld together, as the title implies, to create a great new hit. Of course, we also see a romance spring up between the two leading characters, and we get a few small sub-plots to fill up the rest of the film. The acting is very good overall, and the delivery of some of the more entertaining lines is very funny. We also get a hilarious music video at the start of the film from Fletcher's former pop duo group. There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, but the film is not hilarious. It is, however, very enjoyable to watch and ranks very high amongst most modern romantic comedies. It's not fantastic, but it's very pleasant.",6,0,1,20 June 2007
Despicable Me," Neither Despicable Nor Great
","The premise of 'Despicable Me' seemed simple. The idea was to take a colorful villain and put him at the center of a film. This idea stemmed from the notion that, in many Good v. Evil stories, the villain steals the show from the blander or less compelling protagonist (see 'Austin Powers'). I applaud the creators of 'Despicable Me' for their attempt, but not so much for their execution. At the start of 'Despicable Me,' we see the allegedly dastardly Gru performing small acts of rudeness; he comes off immediately as a bully with a big car. We soon learn that Gru has assembled a horde of so-called 'minions' to accomplish such wicked ends as stealing the statue of liberty and the Eiffel tower. Embracing the silliness of the archetypal megalomaniac, the film then creates a rivalry between Gru and fellow villain Vector, both of whom try to steal the moon. This overblown rivalry leads to scenes of eye-popping physical comedy. It also allows the film's creators to show off the hijinks of the minions, who manage to be both adorable and riveting to watch. While they don't always serve the plot, they're always a blast to behold, and they save the film from the masses of cookie-cutter animated films. Unfortunately, other aspects of the story cannot be saved from such a wasteland of incompetence.The primary problem with 'Despicable Me' is that it becomes a generic 'curmudgeon softens up' story before too long. In an attempt to force the viewer to sympathize with the supposedly villainous Gru, the creators strip away his villainous qualities. Instead of wreaking havoc, Gru begins to learn what it takes to be a good father. Suddenly strapped with three kids, Gru becomes attached to them. Sadly, when he finally settles into his new lifestyle, a wrench enters the works. We've seen this plot line before, most notably in 'Kramer v. Kramer,' and it doesn't belong in such an otherwise silly and light-hearted film. As an attempt at emotional resonance, the father-figure story will work just fine for families, but it didn't work for me.'Despicable Me' is a lean machine; I only wish it were a little meaner.What begins as a clever spin off of the superhero genre becomes a run-of-the-mill tale of parenting and love, but hey- at least it has minions.",6,1,6,5 August 2010
Raging Bull," What a Film!
","'Raging Bull' is easily the greatest Scorsese film, as well as one of the greatest films ever made. It should have nabbed the Oscar for Best Picture.Robert DeNiro stars in his second Academy Award-winning performance as Jake LaMotta, the factual boxer-turned-seedy nightclub owner. The film is really divided into two parts. The first part of the film focuses on LaMotta's rise to the top in the boxing arena. It also serves as an exposition of the characters, introducing us to LaMotta's future wife, played by Cathy Moriarty, as well as his brother Joey, played exceptionally well by Joe Pesci. There's especially a lot of foreshadowing of future conflicts in th story. The fight scenes are brutally realistic, and certain shots serve as perfect showings of the raging bull that was LaMotta. The move to shoot the film in black-and-white was key, being that it makes the film age better and rely on the older, better tricks to be great.The two parts are really separated by a montage of colored home videos showing the growing relationship, marriage, and early parenthood of LaMotta and his stunning young wife.The second part is the place where all hell breaks loose. The bull begins to rage, isolating himself first from his brother and then from his wife, both due to her unhappiness and promiscuous nature. The dialogue in this part of the film is perfect, revealing the characters all to the audience for what they truly are.The acting is the real key to the film. DeNiro gives the best performance of the film, portraying LaMotta in a realistic and effectively brutal manner. Pesci and Moriarty, both of who earned nominations for Supporting Oscars, are superb as supporting players in the stellar plot. The cinematography and costumes also perfectly convey the time and setting of the film, which is set mostly around the time of World War Two. It's a superb film, and one of my all-time favorites.I'd recommend this film to anyone age fifteen or older, male or female. This is due to typical Scorsese pervasive use of the f- word, extreme violence as times, explicit sexual content, and a movingly brutal plot. Still, for people who fit into the above-mentioned category, see this film as soon as you can! Note: (recommendations) If you enjoyed this film, you may also enjoy 'Pulp Fiction,' 'Mean Streets,' 'Goodfellas,' and 'The Godfather: Parts 1 & 2.'",10,2,4,4 July 2007
Shrek," Don't Watch it More than Once or Twice!
","I saw 'Shrek' for the first time when it came out back in 2001, and found it mildly funny. However, the next time I saw it, the fun was all pretty much gone, and I saw the film for what it really was: not that great.'Shrek' is the story of the adventures of an ogre named Shrek, played by Mike Myers. No surprises there. When his swampy home is invaded by fairy tale creatures, Shrek embarks on a journey with his new companion Donkey (Eddie Murphy) to find who is responsible. This journey leads him to the scheming Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow). Farquaad asks Shrek and Donkey to fetch him the lovely Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz). This is where the story really begins. 'Shrek' is basically a parody of fairy tales in general. There's a wolf in Grandma's drag, a 'terrorizing' female dragon, three blind mice dressed like modern blind men, among many others. Unfortunately, the fun of seeing these caricatures and the way they interact wears off after a little while, revealing the film for what it really is: a clichéd fairy tale in itself. The plot is something we've seen a thousand times in the very fairy tales that the film tries to poke fun at.Still, 'Shrek' is certainly fun for a while. The animation is really neat and unique, bringing out the actors who voice the characters. Also, there are some really funny bits with Fiona and Robin hood's band of merry men, as well as some chuckles about Farquaad's Magic Mirror.Overall, the film is pretty good fun the first time you see it, and does have some really funny moments. I'd recommend that you rent this one and buy the sequel instead.7/10",6,1,2,5 June 2007
Casino Royale," Satisfactory Bond, Unsatisfactory Film
","'Casino Royale' starts off well enough with an obligatory murder scene and an entertaining chase. Unfortunately, from this point, it's all downhill. The rest of the film moves very slowly and without much conviction. Anytime there is even a hint at an intense action moment, it dies away momentarily. There are so many problems with this film that it would be impossible for them to be over-shadowed by its triumphs. The acting is almost uniformly average. Judi Dench is witty as usual in her role as 'M', but we've seen her in the role before. Eva Green tries her best to be clever and strong, but she ends up falling flat. Her character simply becomes more and more simplistic, never regrowing the intensity we see at her introduction. Daniel Craig has a similar problem as Jmaes Bond. Though he gives a satisfactory performance, he has no real hint of the fun and witty personality we've come to expect from James Bond. Instead, he seems to be more of a hollow shell. The worst casting decision in the film was that of 'Le Chiffre.' Instead of a classic Bond villain, he comes off as an ambitious pawn who seems to have a good poker game. Still, the film's biggest problem is the story line. The creators of this film have removed any trace of action-packed fun from the franchise. There are no gadgets, no exciting car chases, no 'Q', and no scenes of true intensity that made the franchise famous. This is a simple, low-octane, and predictable poker movie that has been elevated to blockbuster status only because of the franchise it is connected to.",10,2,4,29 April 2007
The Deer Hunter," A Potent Anti-War Film
","With the outbreak of the Vietnam War, Hollywood began bursting with a new crop of war films. These films weren't about American honor and the land of the free. Instead, they were about the tragedy of war and its negative effect on people. Some of these films were met with critical contempt and disgust, while others were met with near-universal praise and love. 'The Deer Hunter' fits into the category of the latter.The acting in 'The Deer Hunter' is its greatest element. Robert DeNiro is pitch-perfect as usual in a great performance as an intelligent man who finds that his life is spinning and changing rapidly as he goes to war in Vietnam. Meryl Streep is fantastic as well in her star-making performance as a struggling woman who finds herself losing her lover(s) to the terrible war. John Cazale is also very good as one of the more under-the-radar characters. Still, the gold medal for this film belongs to Christopher Walken, who rightfully won the Oscar for his performance as a troubled soldier who handles his losses in the worst ways possible. I won't give anything away, but in the final moments of the film between Walken and DeNiro, more emotions erupt and sadness ensues than in any other war film in history. In fact, I feel almost stupid to call it a war film. It's not really. though some of the sequences in the film are set in Vietnam and involve fighting, this film is not about the fighting and the battles. It rises above films like 'Saving Private Ryan' because it's not about the battles themselves, but the people who fight them. It's a tale of love, friendship, loss, life, and death. This is a cinematic masterpiece in which characters are presented realistically and action realistic ways. It's sad but intensely accurate: one of the great films of the ages.",10,4,10,16 June 2007
The Great Escape," An Undeniable Classic
","'The Great Escape' is easily one of the greatest films ever made. It chronicles the story of a number of Allied prisoners sent to a Nazi prison camp during WWII. The imprisonment eventually leads to, as the title implies, a large-scale escape attempt.This film has everything. It has comedic moments throughout, especially with conversations between the main American officer and the jealous Asian SS guard (former Boy Scout). It also has a gripping plot and a cast of irresistible characters. As the film goes on, we learn to really like the prisoners. When the time comes and the escape begins,, our nerves rise up immediately. The film squeezes you and never lets go.Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough give career defining roles, each with intense escape scenes of their own. The motorcycle chase involving McQueen, for example, is one of the greatest chase scenes ever filmed.'The Great Escape' is deep, gripping, exciting, emotional, sad, enthralling, moving, inspiring, and unrelentlessly phenomenal. It is easily the greatest war-time prison camp film of its time, and will be enjoyed by countless generations to come.",10,1,4,1 May 2007
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," High School and Werewolves and Vamps, Oh My!
","Bella Swan has her work cut out for her. To an outsider, her struggle would seem both fascinating and difficult; choosing between a suave, gentlemanly vampire and an aggressive, handsome werewolf would be hard for any high school student, right? Well, in the case of the 'Twilight' series, this potentially compelling decision holds no suspense whatsoever. Bella becomes smitten with teen vamp Edward Cullen's icy complexion and awe-inspiring eyebrows the moment she meets him. While she sometimes gets frustrated with his Victorian ideals and his grand gestures, she always crawls back to him, begging for more.On the other end, Bella has Jacob Black, her childhood friend, who has recently become a werewolf (just how this happened is beyond me). Jacob grows sick of being Bella's pal, so he throws a series of hissy fits to try and win her affection. The audience, of course, knows that Bella will never choose Jacob (this isn't a spoiler; I have yet to even read the final installment of the series). In fact, it seems to me that Jacob exists in the films for the sole purpose of flexing his muscles, and that seems to be more than good enough cause in the eyes of the primarily female audience that the films command.I realize that these comments could've just as well been tied to the last Twilight film, 'New Moon,' but that's kind of the point. Not much happens in this supposed 'saga.' For the past two films, Bella has simply sat around and tried to make a decision. As far as I'm concerned, she made this decision back in the first film, so there isn't much suspense to watching her ponder over it now. Some would argue that Bella is a type of Hamlet figure, and that her indecision, while frustrating, is intriguing enough to embrace fully. Unfortunately, the stakes of Bella's decision never seem all that high in the films, and not much happens as she ponders. 'Eclipse' seems to think it has an epic plot in the form of an approaching ragtag vamp army, but even this excursion offers little aside from more opportunities for Bella, Edward, and Jacob to bicker, and for Dakota Fanning and Bryce Dallas Howard to grab a few minutes of screen time.Very little happens in 'Eclipse,' and Bella's indecision seems both unwarranted and uninteresting. That being said, the film succeeds on a technical level. The visuals have a real sense of scale to them, despite the fact that some seem too big for the moments they showcase. The visual effects are also fairly impressive, and the music is terrific as usual. While Kristen Stewart resorts to constantly playing with her hair and Taylor Lautner's voice is grating, most of the performances are solid. On the whole, 'Eclipse' makes for a beautiful, yet hollow, shell of a movie. Hopefully, the next installment will fill that empty space.",5,7,10,31 July 2010
Gangs of New York," An Underrated, yet Superb Scorsese Film
","When you here the name 'Martin Scorsese' these days, three films come to mind; 'Goodfellas', 'Raging Bull', and the relatively new 'The Departed.' However, 'Gangs of New York' certainly deserves a place on the long list of Scorsese classics. The story has been told a million times in a variety of forms; Two rivals and there gangs try to gain superiority and power over one another. Daniel Day-Lewis's Bill and DiCaprio's Amsterdam are the major players, and New York is the battleground. On the surface, this film is a violent, vulgar, and period-piece-esquire film. However, underneath, there is a really interesting conflicted story of motives, passion, and human nature. This deeper side is brought about by Daniel Day Lewis's intensely powerful and profound portrayal of the 'villainous' Bill the Butcher.' While Bill is the obvious antagonist of the story and Amsterdam the protagonist, we find that both characters commit villainous acts everyday. They are simply similar men on opposite sides of an ongoing battle. However, it is during this battle, when we begin to see useless side plots, where the movie's weak points shine through. Cameron Diaz, though a fine actress, is the wrong woman for her role. The supporting cast is made up of fine actors who simply don't fit into there roles. Even DiCaprio seems strangely distant and unfocused during the film, and never really connects with the audience. Still, despite its shortcomings, 'Gangs of New York' is a stunningly picturesque portrayal of gangsters in New York in the mid' 1800s, and will surely be enjoyed by audiences for years to come.",10,0,2,29 April 2007
Happy Feet," Unbelievably Overrated
","'Happy Feet' is a lively, song-filled, and visually stunning story of a group of penguins. It's also incredibly overrated, long-winded, lengthy, bizarre, and it has no real heart.The film starts off well enough, and the first thirty minutes would have tempted me to give it an 8 or 9 out of ten. The opening scenes are fun and lively, filled with good tunes and an interesting storyline. Basically, 'Happy Feet' is the story of Mumbles, a penguin who just doesn't belong in his community. While the other penguins can sing amazingly well at an early age, Mumbles has a terrible voice and can only tap his feet. In the beginning, his voice and the voices of his friends all sounded very cute to me, and the penguins themselves were as cute as can be. Unfortunately, when Mumbles grows up, the film goes downhill. Elijah Wood does a terrible job at voicing Mumbles, and his speeches and dialogues seem to drag on forever. As the story progresses, he first falls for Gloria, but leaves his penguin community to fin a place where he belongs. This is the start of the long and dragged-out plot of the film, which I found completely dull and strange.Eventually, as always, the animated penguins come in contact with humans. This is the low point of the film because the humans are not animated, which is very creepy, and the director tries to bring in an environmental spin on the story.Overall, the film is too long and the plot stops being interesting the second Mumbles and his friends become adults. The voice acting is great for the most part, but I found Robin Williams's different voicings kind of racist and stereotypical, and Elijah Wood does an awful job as the leading male. Still, the song and dance numbers are very fun and I enjoyed the animation for the most part.5/10",5,0,1,6 June 2007
The Simpsons Movie," Worth The Price of Admission
","'The Simpsons Movie' is funny. It's really funny. in fact, it's incredibly funny, and funny enough for me to consider paying to see it a second time in the theater. Even those not familiar with the show should find something to like in this mixed bag of a comedy.The plot is goofy at best, but then again, who would want it any other way? Basically, Homer makes a big mistake that gets him in big trouble with the other inhabitants of Springfield and gets his town in trouble with the government. You'll have to see it to believe it. Most of the major characters from the show at least make appearances, most of them leaving me laughing. Though it's certainly not working on a very high level, it still works miraculously. It left everyone in the theater where I saw it clapping in the end. Unlike almost every other film produced these days, it has a short and clean run-time as well as a hilariously tight script. I can't dignify putting it on the same level as 'The Godfather' or 'psycho,' but it's certainly worth seeing. It works, from start to finish, like a charm. D'oh!",8,2,6,31 July 2007
Up in the Air," First-Class Dramedy
","'Up in the Air' manages to be funny, poignant, and troubling, often all at once. It's a film about people, jobs, and the fulfillment that these things do or do not bring. It's also director Jason Reitman's most mature and even film so far in his career.Protagonist Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) constantly flies from city to city to fire people. When a boss is too cowardly to let his/her employees go, Bingham steps in with his sleek suits and ominous 'new opportunity' brochures. Like Aaron Eckhart's tobacco spokesman in Reitman's 'Thank You For Smoking,' Clooney's Bingham is superb at what he does. From his cleanly efficient airport behavior to his awe-inspiring firing routines, Bingham is a force of nature; Clooney captures his bravado perfectly.The plot really opens when Natalie (Anna Kendrick), a young upstart, introduces a new system to Bingham's company; firing sessions will now take place through a Skype-like video conferencing system. An outraged Bingham has no choice but to take Natalie along with him for his next round of sessions, so that he can 'show her the ropes.' The plot lifts off at this point, with some turbulence and some twists along the way.'Up in the Air' works primarily because of its performances and its script. Clooney sells Bingham unquestionably as a loner who loves to travel. Bingham seeks fulfillment through the collection of Frequent Flyer miles and premium membership cards, but his vision becomes cloudy when a love interest enters the picture. As Bingham's potential soul-mate, Alex, Vera Farmiga is bold, funny, and mysterious. She has a Lauren Bacall sensibility, along with a unique sort of beauty. Yet, the heart and soul of the film is Anna Kendrick. As the film's most dynamic character, Kendrick is totally convincing and compelling. For Bingham, she becomes a wrench in the works. She seems to know her character so well that she truly becomes her for 100 minutes.For its first seventy minutes or so, 'Up in the Air' is a charming romantic/career/teacher-student- comedy. It's hilarious and smart. The rest of the film is a bit darker; it forces characters to step out of the terminal and confront reality (that's as specific as I'll be). While there are still funny moments, the movie becomes more of a drama. Both the mostly-comedic and the mostly-dramatic segments work wonderfully, and the tonal shift feels wholly organic and inevitable.'Up in the Air' is a great film, with great dialogue and great acting. It bodes well for Reitman and its three stars.",10,6,12,16 January 2010
The Godfather," The Best Film of All Time
","'The Godfather' is one of those films that everybody knows about. I heard about it for the first time when I was about three years old, and finally saw it at about age thirteen, after my parents gave in. what I mean to say is that it has achieved such universal fame that it's quoted and discussed everywhere, and rightfully so.'The Godfather' has it all. The cast is classic and the acting universally stellar, the shooting scenes have just the right level of intensity, the lines are all delivered with precision, the plot is enthralling, and the characters are actually interesting to watch.What is the secret to the success of this great film? That's a tough question, but it's really the fact that everything about the film is done to just the right level. It's never boring, and the plot holds plot twists, but not so many that you grow suspicious of the film.As I've said, the acting is exceptional. Obviously, Marlon Brando gives a legendary performance as the likable Don Vito Corleone. However, also noteworthy is James Caan's fiery performance as Sonny Corleone, and Robert Duvall' star-making work as the cool and collective Tom Hagen. The only shame about this movie is that Al Pacino didn't win an Oscar for it. His portrayal of the reluctant future godfather of the family who is eventually completely corrupted by power is pitch-perfect. The fact that Joel Grey won it instead for his clown-faced role in Cabaret is laughable and painful.The bottom line is this. 'The Godfather' will always go down in history as the greatest film of all time, and for good reason. It's 'an offer you can't refuse.'",10,2,5,26 May 2007
