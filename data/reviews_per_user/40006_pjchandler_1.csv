Vertigo," Midge explained
","There seems to be a lot of confusion about the role of Midge. For me, Midge is an essential character. At the beginning of the film Scottie and Midge have a number of 'playful' exchanges, but as Scottie's obsession grows stronger he starts to cut Midge out of his life along with everything else that doesn't involve Madeline. She is the constant that highlights Scottie's fall into obsession. The painting is Midge's own cry for help. Her desperate attempt for Scottie's attention, all of which is now totally focused on Madeline.As for Vertigo overall, it's a brilliant example of Hitchcock's mastery of image. Some here have asked for a remake of this movie, but that would be a pointless exercise and would only serve to highlight the brilliance of this work.",10,2,4,27 December 2001
