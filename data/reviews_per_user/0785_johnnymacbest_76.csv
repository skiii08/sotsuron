Black Swan," A dark, disturbing journey of one's desire for perfection.
","What are the lengths one will go to strive for that ultimate goal, that one milestone that may set the course for their future, that one journey into greatness at the cost of their sanity. That is the question that lingers in 'Black Swan'. A hauntingly beautiful fairytale of one's desire for perfection while succumbing to a side of herself that she never thought existed. Dark, disturbing, and at times unsettling, with so much raw emotion that echoes the sentiment that echoes society. There is a light at the end of the tunnel; however uncertain and precarious, but if one is to reach it, it must not towards the unattainable of perfection, but rather to succeed at the best of one's ability and be all the more adorned and perhaps, loved by it all in the end. Black Swan may be a dark and disturbing journey, but it's a journey with heart and soul that beckons with haunting beauty and surreal imagery.",9,0,2,23 January 2011
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars on.....You know, you know :)
","I don't know what to make of this. Was Lucas trying to recapture the glory days of the original trilogy? I'm not sure but for the most part this film really blows. I know sequels can never outshine the original although in some cases, they do and Empire Strikes Back is a great example; directed by Irvin Kershner. Yes the film has dazzling special effects and the light saber duel at the end is great, but when the dialog is so putrid and contrived and the acting so wooden and lifelessly constipated, it leaves one feeling how Lucas can stoop so low. Characters such as Qui-Gon Jin, Ben Kenobi, and Amidala are barely developed; leaving them nothing more than vapid souls against the uninspired screenplay. The other characters such as the Gungan leader and Watto, are basically blatant racial stereotypes. To make matters worse, they casted a child actor as Anakin, played to imperfection by that little pint-sized muppet Jake Loyd. And last but not least, the most hated hated character in the SW universe Jar Jar Binks, who should've died a VERY HORRIBLE DEATH at the righteous hand of the sadly underused Darth Maul!! The original trilogy had its fare share of corny dialog, but not the extent that this movie provides. All in all, TPM fumbled critically with fans and critics and I happen to be one of them because Lucas has lost his touch with what made the original so enamored and charming: Genuine excitement. Had he filmed the prequels first back in the late '70s, then the originals later on, it could've been even greater. But as it stands, TPM is a forgettable giant pile of excrement that should forever be flushed down the cinematic toilet.",3,5,9,17 May 2008
Sucker Punch," A fistful of mediocrity.
","With 300, Zack Snyder has made it abundantly clear that his movies dazzle they eyes, indeed they do, but his characters never engage the audience in a personal and emotional level. And Sucker Punch is just that. A visually dazzling collage of mental insanity taken to the extreme with a fairly interesting premise that looks promising on the surface, but never truly lets you sink your teeth into the inner workings of the main character.Emily Browning plays Babydoll, a blond bombshell who is placed in a mental institution by her cold stepfather, and is then seen trying to persuade the orderlies into lobotomizing her to keep her from giving details surrounding a tragedy in her life. However, Babydoll begins to create a dreamworld in which not only to pass the time, but to figure a way out of the asylum.As if that makes any sense whatsoever, here are the main problems with Sucker Punch that's been plaguing modern cinema; no plot and character development. Barely any of the characters that the protagonist meets are developed. They're just static talking heads spouting out lines that are trying to hammer into the audience that they are more than just clichÃ©'s and cardboard cutouts. The acting feels stiff and artificial with no sense of tension or suspense. You never feel that the characters are in real danger of any kind. It just goes thru the motions and despite having a nice premise to go on, the film feels like a half-ass-ed attempt to be something new and fresh.Sucker Punch has some merits. The special effects and action scenes are impressive. I did get a kick out of some of the battle scenes which are nicely choreographed and executed with lots of explosions. Watching it is sort of like looking at a silent film on steroids but minus the heart and soul of that bygone era.The incredible aesthetic beauty and action choreography are a lot impressive than Snyder's 300. But the problem with Sucker Punch is that even in a fantasy film, or any action film for that matter, you have to put effort into making the audience care for your characters no matter how good looking the action and special effects are. You simply won't care who lives or dies in this film. At some point, you have to try to make the audience care. This film simply never does.I think that I got my point across perfectly clear regarding this film. If it entertained you, fine, then it did it's job. The problem is is that there's nothing remotely remarkable about this film aside from the visual aspect of this film. If more time was spent fleshing out the story, characters, with a more coherent script, then this could've been a really good film. But since so much potential was utterly wasted, I have no choice but to give my grade and it's a D.",4,599,1102,25 March 2011
Skyfall," Bond is back and better than ever.
","After Quantum of Solace became somewhat of a mix bag and disappointed many fans of the series into becoming reluctant to invest in a new film in the series, I can say that the series is back in track with the newest and best Bond film ever made this year. Gone are the disjointed plot points and character interactions of the previous film; in it's place is a character-driven and intelligently written script with terrific performances from Craig, Dench, Naomi Harris and more. What makes this film better than Quantom and much more different is the emotional and vulnerable aspect of the character. Bond not only shows that he's tough-as-nails secret agent, but also a world-weary human being and 'Skyfall' captures that aspect beautifully along with the stunning cinematography and action scenes.I have no faults with this film; however my only caveat is that it took so damn long to be released. With all the legal and financial woes settled and back in the swing of things, Agent 007 is back and better than ever in a film that feels fresh and exciting the same way as he was reintroduced back into movie theaters in 2006's stellar Casino Royale.",9,2,9,11 November 2012
Iron Man 3," A real ass wiper.
","After the disappointing Iron Man 2, I came into this film with high expectations. Needless to say, I am profoundly and utterly in shock at how average the movie is. It's not that it's all bad per se, but the screenwriters thought that by putting lots of comedy in an action movie juxtaposed with the seriousness and verisimilitude of a Tom Clancy novel that this would work. It didn't. The little side-kick kid was absolutely terrible; although I don't know if it was a cheap gimmick to get more parents with their kids to see it, or cater to that specific demographic, I'm not sure. But they need to stop. I wouldn't have minded if said side-kick was a teenager or someone in their early 20's, THAT would've made a whole lot of sense. All I could say is what was Shane Black thinking?!?!?! This film would've been a lot better if they skimmed the comedy bits and focused more on the story and characters; especially the villains. Although the special effects and action are really impressive, they cannot make up for the uneven and disorienting screenplay.I don't know what to think. Should you skip this movie? Tough choice, but all if you want is something to pass the time, then go for it.(I recommend the matinée) If you're the kind of person that wants story and character development above all else, then you will be disappointed. It's a shame really because Iron Man is a really cool superhero and the first film was a blast to watch. It's MILES ahead better than this one. You're probably better off watching the first film, or wait for Star Trek: Into Darkness or the eagerly anticipated Man of Steel. Iron Man has depth and integrity along with a high dash of wit and charm. Yes the charm is there, but there's no juicy meat.",5,7,14,2 May 2013
Star Trek," Great movie, whether you're a fan or not.
","I've never been interested in anything 'Star Trek' in my life. I don't know why but it just didn't jive with me or it may be because I've been familiar with Star Wars that I didn't even bother to take notice. However, with this new film by Lost/Alias creator JJ Abrams, I'm beginning to take the series, the whole mythology into consideration.Having not been familiar with Star Trek, apart from name only, my overall impression of this film is simply incredible. It proves that you don't really have to be a fan to appreciate this film and JJ and co did a marvelous job of reinvigorating the iconic characters, settings, and that sleek and stylish as hell mother of all space vessels, the iconic and pop-culturally flavored/revered USS Enterprise. No other fictional spaceship that I know of can match the sheer inventiveness and awesomeness of this stellar craft(even more so than the Millennium Falcon and X-Wing). Plus, it also pays to have the quintessential of film; well-developed characters and plot with sharp direction and pacing of balance, something this film has a great abundance of with a side dish of morality, ethics, and bold heroism, especially from the emotionally restrained Spock (played brilliantly by Zachary Quinto). And surprise surprise, it's even cerebral on many levels!! The others do a great job as well, but I for one connected a lot more with Spock. But it was a treat to see Lenord Nimoy as the original Spock which will make fans gush with with joy. That's one of the nice things about film, seeing old friends from years back.It's true there are some scenes in the movies reminiscent of the 'Star Wars' prequels but they never drag the film down at all but rather serve the film really well unlike the prequels which were layered upon layered with action scenes that were there just for the sake of it. Not so here. The film has a nice balance of action and story, just the way a film of this caliber should be.Great film, great cast, great action, great story; overall great film for the old and new generation that does a great job of acquainting newcomers to the franchise (myself included). One of the best sci-fi space epics of the year.",9,2,9,20 May 2009
Iron Man 2," Entertaining but underwhelming.
","If anything that's the media these days is that sequels rarely surpass the original in turns of epic scope and balls-to-the-wall action with the exception of The Dark Knight and Spider-Man 2 as well as the first two X-Men films and Hellboy 2. In my opinion Iron Man 2 is an entertaining and bombastic superhero movie that does well with what you expect from a sequel to the first hit back in '08 but it falls really short on some levels.Well, to put it quite frankly, the sequel itself doesn't feel as coherent as the first film which did a great job of setting up the hero and the suit he uses to fight evil with great doses of humor, warmth, and charm. There are so funny lines in the film but the jokes fall flat and don't have that serious bite that was prevalent in the first film. But the biggest flaw is the story. So many loose threads are left hanging and are never resolved again. I was pleased with the introduction of Whiplash(played excellently by Mickey Rourke)and his motivation to go toe-to-toe with ol' Shellhead, but the film rarely goes in depth into his personality and his inner workings for the audience to truly sympathize with this character. Add to the fact that Natasha Rushman/Romanov known as Black Widow has barely any decent character development along with Sam Jackson as Nick Fury and you have a film that leaves you cold in that respect.Though a plot is essential to telling the story, I was really let down by the lack of action scenes in the film. I enjoyed the fight between Iron Man and Whiplash in the early part of the film as well as between War Machine, but there wasn't enough action to get my adrenaline pumping like it did in the first film. By the end of the film where you thought you was gonna get a satisfying climax, the fight between Iron Man, War Machine, and Whiplash(who looked more impressive than when he first appeared) was over FAR too quickly for it to be truly awesome. Needless to say I was let down BIG time.There's one scene that I felt defied logic. When Iron Man arrives to confront Justin Hammer near the end of the film, Whiplash programs the drones to kill Iron Man and not only that, use War Machine to attack him as well; one of the best scenes in the whole film. But when the robots start firing their weapons, absolutely everyone in the building suffers NO casualties whatsoever. Then finally when Whiplash is defeated, he sets off a self-destruct switch that programs all the robots to explode yet in the aftermath of such event, we witness no injuries or deaths that actually happened. This movie was supposed to show the consequences of letting weapons of mass destruction out into the public yet we never witness the horror of it.With all that said, is Iron Man 2 a good film. The answer is a fair yes and I was entertained. However, there's no denying that it is the weakest compared to the first film which I enjoyed a lot. With the recent news that Iron Man 2 will tie into the upcoming Avengers film, I feel somewhat skeptical as to how this all is gonna play out. I like superhero movies but when they start crossing over into other universes, it becomes all too much. Iron Man 2 is a good film but it's story and plot leaves a lot to be desired.",7,0,1,23 May 2010
World War Z," World War Z is more about the visuals than the characters.
","With the summer blockbuster movie season in the swing, audiences expect all the usual trappings that come along with such; i.e huge explosions and no plot. That's what you'll get with World War Z, a film that is flash and substance, cranked to insane levels with bucket loads of CGI and little regards for smooth and cohesive narrative which could've elevated it beyond just action and special effects.I'm not familiar with the original novel on which this film is based, but from the looks of it, it seems to be aimed at only a specific demographic; that is those that crave mindless action above all else. There's nothing wrong with that, but I suppose those(like me) that want story and character development ALONG with action, will be disappointed as World War Z, to them, only resembles the original novel IN NAME ONLY. Superficial performances from some of the lead characters, save for Brad Pitt, dull the experience immensely as a film of this caliber demands hard, vicious violence and tense, frightening atmosphere, that, unfortunately enough, are sparsely sprinkled about in this film. There's no doubt that some of the film's action scenes are impressive, but one gets the feeling that because of it's PG-13 rating, a bane of zombie flicks, are so tame that to call it a TRUE zombie flick would be an act of blasphemous disservice. Ultimately, it would seem that with so many rewrites to the script and filming of scenes, it clearly became a case of 'too many cooks spoiling the broth'.The potential for something like this to be greater than the sum of it's parts were here, but the execution of such potential into something natural, organic, and emotionally and intellectually engaging, falls equally and devastatingly flat on it's cinematic ass. World War Z once again proves the inept and ADD-riddled filmmaking process of Hollywood is once again, cropping up and utterly ruining a film's potential to be something great. I'm not sure if I want to see this film again; I'll wait for the director's cut. IF indeed such A CUT exists, then I suspect it would be an overall improvement over the theatrical release, but since it's too early in the game for such a thing, I've no choice but to conclude that World War Z, ultimately, pales in comparison to it's much superior counterparts '28 Days Later' 'Night of the Living Dead' 'The Walking Dead' and to a certain extent, even the bloody yet comedic romp 'Night of the Comet' and other notable films of this tried-and-true genre. If a sequel is made and judging by the latest box-office numbers, I don't fail to see why. Only ardent, die-hard fans can hope for the next film that features more blood and guts, more heroism, and most importantly, more character development.",4,48,100,22 June 2013
The Hunger Games," A tragic, yet enthralling experience.
","Never have I had such an enthralling experience from The Hunger Games. It's not a heartwarming nor easy film to appreciate as it's dark and sinister tone punctuated with brutal violence(even for a PG-13 film) and callousness towards fellow human beings is enough to give anyone watching chills. All the acting, especially from Jennifer Lawrence is simply incredible. With such raw emotion and pulsating intensity, she's grabs your attention(along with the well-written script and dialog and plot) like wet rope and never lets go. She was simply born for this role and her performance will really resonate with audiences who had the chance to experience this dark epic. My only peeve is that some of the characters were not developed. The audience never got the chance to see things from the point of view from the other characters. But that's not enough to enjoy this film which is overall very dark with very little in the way of humor. I hope the next film will delve more deeper into the world and characters that inhabit it and judging by the phenomenal box-office results, I have become a new fan to this franchise. A second viewing is definitely not out of my league.",9,2,7,22 April 2012
The Fifth Element," One of Luc Besson's best movies.
","This is a remarkable movie with a storyline that has never been seen before. Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, Gary Oldman, and Chris Tucker star in the sci-fi hit of 1997 with dazzling special effects, action, comedy, and romance set in a colorful, extravagant future where good has fought evil every 5,000 years. Everyone aboard gives great performances hands-down throughout. I could tell everyone had fun working on this film, especially with creativity put into the costumes, sets, creatures, the futuristic weaponry, the works. The visuals are dated compared to today's standards and the film is a tad cartoonish but that gives it charm and style and it's still good nonetheless. I would've liked to see the characters and the plot fleshed out more. Those quibbles aside, The Fifth Element is a roller-coaster thrill ride of a movie so see it and be amazed at the genuine sights and sounds of this space epic.",9,3,5,22 April 2008
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Completely misses the mark on every level.
","Let me state that I am a HUGE fan of Wolverine and was just dying to see this film with high expectations. Well, after coming out of the theater, I stress wholeheartedly they should've been lowered to the lowest degree.Throughout the course of the film, Wolverine and Sabertooth get thirty minutes of character development and that's fine because they are my favorite Marvel characters which I thought everything would go smoothly from that point. But imagine my surprise when Gambit shows up on the scene and guess what: he's reduced to a freaking 4 MINUTE CAMEO!!! Gambit (who should've been in the first two films) along with EVERYONE ELSE gets reduced to second billing. I mean, this is SUPPOSED to be his movie, not some Marvel Superhero Reunion. Save that for the damn Avengers movie for crying out loud.There are other things from the comics this film virtually ignores: The rivalry between Wolverine and Sabertooth, the inner workings of the Weapon X project, his relationship with Yuriko Oyama (known as Lady Deathstrike) and the nature of Wolverine's character. In the comics, Wolverine is very violent and berserk; here 'they' sugarcoat his animal-like fury into a generic, uninteresting, carbon-copy Death Wish type that lacks any tension or suspense whatsoever. At least Sabertooth was the only character that's close to his comic book version. And I can never understand why the hell is CYCLOPS in this movie? In the comics, he never was involved with Wolverine until later on. Special effects and action are good but time and time again they STILL keep using the quick editing, shaky camera technique that's as cliché in so many action movies it's not even funny; it's painful.Overall this film had the potential to be another successful Marvel adaptation like Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk released last year. Instead, it amounts to nothing more than a spectacle over substance with no cohesion or originality. Like so many brainless action films, this film completely misses the mark completely and judging by the film itself, was probably a victim of studio tampering.Avoid like the plague.X-Men 1 and 2 are MUCH better choices.",3,19,41,4 May 2009
Orphan," Hands down the best thriller I've seen this year.
","I've seen a few thrillers over the years of visiting the theater but none of them really captured my interest or gripped me like wet rope. When I first saw the trailers for this, I thought 'I am so gonna see this' so I came into this with high expectations. And you know what? This film not only met them but exceeded them tremendously. Most thrillers jump straight into the film with no build up; here it makes a huge impression by letting us get to know the characters and their inner struggles nicely sprinkled with interesting back stories that gives the film added gravity. I suppose some are impatient to the slow build up but I had no problem at all of the film going from a slow start and it really pays off. No thriller has ever kept me on the edge of my seat like this one. It's intelligently directed and written with best performances; the real standout being of course Isabel Furhman, who gives one hell of a villainous role that rivals that of Kathy Bates's character in 'Misery'. One of the best parts of the film is the visual cues during certain scenes that are clearly a reflection of the dark inner psyche of a truly tormented 'young' soul. I'm not gonna spoil any plot details in this review but I will say that you should definitely see 'Orphan' because it's one of the best psychological thrillers of the year.10 stars all the way.",10,5,8,9 August 2009
X-Men," Embodies the spirit of the comics almost perfectly.
","I gotta give my props to Brian Singer. Man, what a fantastic job he did in bringing my favorite mutant superhero team to the big screen. The X-men comics have decades of established treasured mythology and this film does it justice almost perfectly. Some story elements have been altered here and there but it never undermined the finished product significantly as to throw off die-hard fans, although I was disappointed that Gambit wasn't included. But the film superbly makes up for that with action, special effects (and what MARVELOUS EFFECTS they are!!!) and a plot that's intellectually stimulating actually. It's a shame that most action films today don't have that kind of pizazz and gravitas to keep it from being mindlessly entertaining. Not so here as X-Men challenges its viewers to ponder the nature of acceptance , fear, and prejudice. My one main complaint is that the villains such as Sabertooth wasn't fleshed out more and similar to his vicious comic book counterpart. I will purchase the director's cut for any bells and whistles not in the theatrical cut but for the most part 'X-Men' is an exciting and exhilarating experience with something more beneath the surface even more so than action films today and I can say with all authority it embodies the spirit of the comics nearly spot on.Great film.",9,0,1,3 June 2008
Spider-Man 3," Spider-Man 3 and the comedy of errors.
","I must admit when I saw the previews for it back in 2007, I wasn't all that enthusiastic about it and for good reason: I had a gut feeling that it wasn't gonna be as good as the previous films as sequels have a tendency to falter and fall after their second installments(I'm looking at you X-Men 3) so with all that I went in to Spider-Man 3 and words cannot express how utterly disappointed I was. Having recently re-watched it on DVD, I can see the MAJOR problems with it which I will list numerically.1. Too many villains. Remember way back when Spider-Man 1 and 2 had only 1 villain? That's how focuses the films were. You got into their heads on what they were feeling and their evil plans were and etc. But they were also well-developed characters and the audience cared for them as things went along. Sandman was the only character that was developed and was simply awesome. Too bad the same can't be said for Venom and New Goblin; they pretty much was window dressing.2. The acting. Thomas Hayden Church was wonderful as Sandman and did a great performance but the most laughable part is the emotional scenes between Peter and MJ. Stiff, fake, constipated is what comes to mind with these scenes; hell, it might as well have been scripted for a sitcom.3. The humor. Spider-Man 1 and 2 had great sense of humor. Not this time. It's more on the lines of 'McHale's Navy' kind of humor. The kind that makes you want to bang your head on the table or against the wall if you're so inclined, which I don't recommend you do or I'll be blasted for promoting self harm.4. Peter acting like a doofus instead of being the bad-ass, evil villainous persona when he's under control of the symbiote. Venom was NEVER like that in the comics or animated series. In Spider-Man: TAS, he was very close to his comic-book counterpart. This version of Venom in Spider-Man 3 is more of a creepy Pee-Wee Herman rather than a alien symbiote.5. Gwen Stacy. Though I liked her in this film as well as the reboot, I felt she was unnecessary in this. She didn't do much in the film and after the dinner scene at the restaurant, which was admittedly funny, she was completely forgotten about; never to be mentioned again.There are so many things wrong with this movie that I simply can't list them all. If you liked this film, fine, more power to you. But this one's a stinker for many of the reasons stated above. I'm glad that they rebooted the series after this because studio interference, NOT Raimi, ruined this film. It made a lot of money at the box-office but to be honest, Spider-Man 3 is nothing more than a comedy of errors.",3,1,2,22 July 2012
Resident Evil: Extinction," Soulless garbage.
","Despite the fact that this movie is based on a video game, in truth nothing works in this film, or whatever you may call 'it'. Why make a movie based on a video game when the storyline and plot works just fine on the small screen? Face it; RE1 and 2 sucked, BIG TIME. The special effects and the setting is great(bombed-out deserted Las Vegas, great idea) but what's the point if there's no solid foundation to work from? The script is filled with so much cheese and plain flat 'acting' that I cared very little about the characters or the story for that matter. And since when did the main character ever lept up in the air to kick a zombie in the face? I've never played the Resident Evil games(though I plan on doing so since I'm new to the franchise) but for those who did this is a direct contradiction of the games where the focus is on gunplay and puzzle solving. Never once do the characters display any sense of brainpower that the characters in the games did. In the end, they just blow the zombies away in typical B-movie fashion.I'm tired of Hollywood. No really I AM!!! Someone PLEASE end these soulless heaps of garbage before the movie industry as a whole becomes a lost art.",1,9,17,26 September 2007
Cloverfield," Unconventional.
","Having seen the preview of this movie last year, I thought it was going to be 'cookie-cutter material'. But when I actually seen it, it was clear to me that this film is not like any sci-fi film I've seen in recent years.It gets slow at first but once things kick into high gear the whole shebang sets in and to be frank, its an exhilarating and frantic experience as the players in this piece become entangled into a nightmarish scenario with scenes that hearkens back to 911. It's almost and allegory, in its depiction. Almost. Fear sets in. What is out there? What's going on? What is happening? Is it a terrorist attack, natural disaster? Or is it something else? Something ominous, deadly, mysterious, and ultimately terrifying? Visually the film is top-notch with its hand-held filming technique and wicked special effects coupled with tension and despair amongst a metropolitan landscape. What makes this film so effective in its storytelling is that its verisimilitude mirrors ours in such spectacular ways. Sure films like Children of Men used some aspects of the techniques described earlier, but to film it entirely in this format is something unheard of before. You actually feel like you're a part of the show. The monsters are hideous and innovative in design and concept. In my opinion, kudos should be given for such impressive displays.The only nitpick I have with this film is vague info about the creature itself. It would have been great if its origin was coherently more fleshed out. But in a way, it works. Keeping the monsters obscure is more effective. Still, the ending left me with a bunch of questions and that's a good thing. A really good thing. The film is unconventional and that's what sets it apart from the cookie-cutter norm that Hollywood is so known for.",9,1,9,19 January 2008
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Good but a little weak.
","Having enjoyed the first two films in the original trilogy, this one comes out slightly weaker of the bunch. Some plot points feel rushed and some scenes felt unnecessary and a little contrived but that doesn't make the film bad by any means whatsoever but there's no denying that it could've been more fleshed out in execution and style and I don't think I'm alone in my assessment. Some of the feeling of adventure is sorely missing in this film whether it's the script, dialog, or performances or it could be those damn Ewoks!!! The scenes on Endor are somewhat laughable and silly and stunts the film. ROTJ is good but its weakness lies in its storytelling and overall genuine awe.",8,0,1,30 May 2008
Taxi Driver," The eyes of a lost soul.
","Some movies have the power and the immediacy to get into your head and wash way any preconceptions and reservations of how they are made. Movies like Gone With The Wind, Star Wars, The Godfather, and 2001's A Space Oddessey, are one of the few that can achieve this goal. With Taxi Driver, directed by Martin Scorsese, this film pulls you in and never lets go.The premise of this urban tale deals with a lost soul living amongst the gritty decadence filled with sleazy, unscrupulous individuals, violence and crime. He goes about his days picking up fares along the way. However, his mind descends further into madness and anger until he finally....snaps.What Scorsese has achieved is nothing short of amazing. The cinematography completely absorbs you into '70s era of NYC with an air of authentically mesmerizing atmosphere punctuated by on the edge lashing out fury with a riveting score that sets the tone of the film perfectly. Overriding this all is the stunning performance of Robert Deniro, who gives the central character of the piece a conflicting angst antihero whose only chance may be that of possible redemption is when he meets a a young prostitute (played by Jodie Foster)torn between her family and the doomed society that she inhabits. Cybil Sheperd and Harvey Kietel give good supporting performances as well; although Cybil's is a little weak in spots but still tops it off.This is more than just a film. It is a diatribe of a man who views the world as dark, bleak, and violent. It is the story of a man who longs for companionship. Ultimately, it is the story of a man who lashes out at the world.",8,0,1,31 December 2008
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain America is back and better than ever!!!
","Having just seen Captain America: The Winter Soldier, I gotta say this sequel surpasses the original in so many ways. In it's place of an adventure yarn filled with WW2 action is a modern day political thriller with a dash of Cold War with superhero theatrics that work wonderfully with it's main cast and well-written and gritty script. I liked that the film touched on themes such as privacy, loyalty, rediscovering your past while also facing the future, and many dangers. So if you liked the first film, you're gonna love this sequel. It's a well made film that really ups the stakes for Cap and his allies and enemies wrapped up in a nice package of political intrigue.",9,2,4,6 April 2014
Tangled," Best animated film I've seen since The Lion King.
","What a joyful movie. Generally, I'm not an animated movie fan(especially the CG type) but this is an exception. Filled with witty songs and dialog with stunning vistas and voice acting, 'Tangled' is not only a film, it's also a metaphor for the many conflicting emotions the characters exhibit in the film such as Rapunzel's desire to see the outside world, to Mother Gothel wanting to shelter her from it(for reasons unknown to her but to the audience) to Flynn wanting to make a name for himself. I was utterly surprised despite being a kid's film, it also touches on some pretty adult subject matter such as ageism, selfishness, desire, and love. That was really unexpected from a film of this type. Although it is loosely based on the legend of Rumplestilskin, Tangled is one of the best animated films of this year. See it in 3D to get the full effect.",8,2,5,5 December 2010
Interstellar," Chris Nolan outshines himself once again.
","If there ever was a time that movies can be magical, thought-provoking, emotional, humorous, and at times, dark and disturbing, then this would be it. A work of genius on all levels, Nolan's latest bundle of joy is 'Interstellar', one of the best films I've ever seen coming from the impeccable caliber of Nolan's pedigree for bringing out best acting performances against the backdrop of stellar and awe-inspiring visuals.The plot goes like this. Earth is in a bind and the only way to save what remains of humanity is to travel to the farthest reaches of space, to find the answers to mankind's salvation. But along the way, stunning revelations and deep character emotions are brought to the surface as the fate of humanity hangs in the proverbial and perpetual balance.I won't say too much about the plot, and although it starts slow(which to some viewers may be off-putting but for me it was perfect)the more it unravels the more exciting and enthralling it is to witness. And all of this wouldn't be possible if it wasn't for Nolan's impeccable directing, sharp and well-written dialog, along with the best performances from Matthew McConaughey, Michael Cain, and of course, Anne Hathaway. With this caliber of acting talent, nothing can go wrong;especially a film of Nolan's making. There is action, but it is not as prevalent in Nolan's earlier films, and for me, that is refreshing; making the audience focus more on the story and characters, rather than the wham-pow theatrics of other films. There's a time and place for such things, but here, it is all the more welcome.Although I'm sure some will say that this film borrows from other films, and to an extent, I somewhat agree. But this film is something really special to see. Not only do we get discussions on sacrifice, the nature of mortality and morality, heroism, and longing for a more innocent time, but also on many scientific theories on wormholes, interstellar travel, the vast and often, loneliness of space,and hope in the face of despair and anguish, and Nolan handles these themes with style and grace with many heartwarming moments of warmth and love. As a fan of science-fiction, I love this film wholeheartedly. And even I was convinced that some of what's in the film could one day become science fact: What if man can travel much farther in space then we are capable now? What if we can discover 3 to 4 dimensional space? And what if we can achieve time travel? These are questions that this film leaves, and though there are no easy answers, it is nonetheless, absolutely RIVETING to even think about such possibilities as to what can be achieved.I'd say this film is like a Greek tragedy of man challenging the gods and whether or not they will succeed in such a feat. But after seeing this film and being absolutely BLOWN AWAY by it, I'm just anxious to see what Nolan and co come up with next. 'Interstellar' directed by acclaimed director Christopher Nolan, is one of the best films I've seen this year and is bound to be a timeless classic.",9,1,5,23 November 2014
Pacific Rim," Great film.
","One of the best films I've seen this year. A unique blend of Japanese mecha and kaiju that pays homage to those films, Pacific Rim is a film that not only dazzles the senses, but it's also a human story at heart and that's the most important part of any film that has the fate of the world hanging in the balance with epic battles at the forefront. I found this film MUCH BETTER than the Transformers films. Though those films had epic action scenes, the big difference is that you can ACTUALLY see the action; no quick-style-MTV-ADD-riddled editing. The action flows organically along with the story, which is both exciting, fresh, and well-acted. Some of the characters were underdeveloped, but the leads are impressive with great performances throughout.Pacific Rim is one of those films that simply make you say, WOW!!! A really fun time at the movies and a nice change of pace from the gritty blockbusters in theaters now. I hope they get a sequel going because I'm really excited to see what their gonna come up with next.",8,15,23,27 July 2013
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," It's not terrible per se, but I still found it fairly enjoyable.
","After the dog-poo experience that was TPM, I reserved any expectations when I first saw it on opening day sometime in '02. Just don't ask me why.OK, anyway on to the review. Having just seen it again on video I gotta say that although I 'liked it' at least it wasn't as bad as the TPM, but it's still plagued by a bare-bones plot, wooden acting and writing, plot holes and too much special effects. Despite being the second prequel which is SUPPOSED to show the rise of the clone army and showing the creation of said army, it just feels like nothing actually happening. And lets not forget those god-awful cringe-inducing CHEESY 'romantic' scenes between Anakin and Padme. Anakin and Padme sittin' in a tree, kiss...oh who the HELL CARES when it's so DOWNRIGHT CORNY!!! I do give the film some credit though that chase scene at the beginning ripped off The Fifth Element (a MUCH SUPERIOR FILM than TPM and AOTC) I admit the fight between Ben Kenobi and Jango Fett on Kamino and in space, the arena-style battle on Genoisis, and the lightsaber duel near the end were fun to watch. The creature designs, spaceships, and planets are impressive; a shame they did little to cover up the glaring problems of the whole piece. What I don't understand is since Lucas obviously isn't a good writer and directer and having labored himself so heavily to try to make AOTC perfect, why didn't he just hire Irvin Kershner, Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett to write and direct AOTC (or even PM)?!?!? Sheesh, there are some things even Lucas can't swallow.When the reviews poured in from various media outlets and word-of-mouth when AOTC was released, I wholeheartedly agreed with them. The first two prequels just weren't well made. None of the magic and intrigue of the originals is here. Sad to say but the series already wore out its welcome after AOTC.",7,2,4,28 May 2008
Captain America: The First Avenger," Captain America ROCKS!!!
","Marvel has another ace property in their string of successful comic-book adaptations and Captain America is one of them. A fine piece of action, drama, political intrigue, and most importantly of all, heart.Chris Evans is simply incredible as the Star Spangled hero of fabled times; times that were at once innocent. But it was also a time of great economic chaos and war. Brave men and women were called upon in their country's greatest hour to fight against oppressive regimes in foreign lands. Many heroes have lived and died, but Captain America lived to fight another day. And even still, he continues to do the right thing. He didn't enter the war to kill Nazis, he instead fought for what he believed in and doing the right thing. In essence, he's the living embodiment of humanity.What I like best about the film and what sets it apart from other Marvel films is that it takes place during WW2, giving viewers a sense of history and context. At a time when America was down on it's knees, they looked to someone who could lift their spirits. And Cap fits that void. Unlike Superman who came from a alien planet, Cap comes from our world. And it's a world that we can really relate to with a sense of verisimilitude that makes you believe that he can(like Batman) exist in our world.The plot stays true to the comic book series while also having a pulp atmosphere to go along with the proceedings but it never goes overboard or diminish the overall story. Some say that it plays a little too much like a spy thriller; it does but it suits the story as the heroes and villains engage in various covert operations that don't seem out of place. I also like the historical and retro-futuristic weaponry and technology in the film and it's really fun to see it in action. But I'm really surprised to see some dark violence and references to the occult in Captain America. For all the time of reading about history, I've never known the Nazis for engaging in the supernatural.All that aside, it's the acting and writing that makes this film. Hugo Weaving is simply awesome as the villainous Red Skull. Despite being a bad guy, he's surprisingly charismatic and a bit humorous albeit with a deeply dark edge. But I don't root for him to succeed as always I want good to triumph over evil in every way. And thankfully Cap and co is there to shine that Star-Spangled shield in his face and his cohorts. There's lots of action, but it's never OTT. It's a mix between the fantastical and the realistic which is a nice touch and Joe Johnston does a great job of handling it all.So for all the Marvel films that have come out this year, Cap is one to watch, not only for it's hero, but also for what he represents to the modern audience which in context reminds us that despite being a fictional hero, what he symbolizes is a reminder that there's a Captain America in all of us.",Null,6,13,31 July 2011
Watchmen," Snyder has done the impossible and achieved it.
","What Zack Snyder (of 300 fame) has done is nothing short of amazing brilliance. He has taken one of the most iconic pieces of literature which was impossible to film, and made it possible!! He's done it and done it really well he has. Having never read the original graphic novel, I was pleasantly surprised with this film. This is one of the best films I have seen this year and I'm pleased to learn that it's one of the Top 250 movies of all time. Watchmen is truly something special with dark themes, brooding atmosphere, deep emotion and dark violence mixed with political and social commentary that bites so deeply into humanity it almost becomes a mirror image of our times;especially now with all the wars, economic collapse, violence that's prevalent in today's world. But none of this wouldn't be done without the sharp, tight direction, editing, and well-written script with beautiful performances with everyone involved.With last year's The Dark Knight, lighting has struck twice for DC Comics and Warner Bros for bringing Watchmen to the big screen. It's not only a great film, it's an achievement. One that could've ended up less than the sum of it's parts but not here. Not now. Not ever. Congratulations, Mr. Snyder. You have done the impossible and achieved it. Another film worthy of praise in the same league as The Dark Knight.",10,2,6,8 March 2009
28 Weeks Later," Good sequel with some minor flaws.
","28 Weeks Later follows up on Danny Boyle's classic superbly. More action, Check. More thrills, Check. Eerie atmosphere, Check. Gripping plot, Check. Terror and suspense, Check. Gore a-plenty with blood, Check. Everything you loved about the first film is cranked up a notch, but not too much that it becomes overbearing. The many parallels between this movie and current events are vaguely sprinkled throughout: giving more realism throughout. However, there's not enough character development as the first one had and the dialog is a little flat and forced but still rockin' nonetheless. 28 Weeks Later serves up another delicious dish of post-apocalyptic survivalist mutant mayhem. Check it out!!! I smell a sequel.",9,2,4,26 August 2008
The Hills Have Eyes," Amped-up and bloody as hell.
","Let me state for the record I'm not a huge fan of horror movies and never will be if the genre breaks new ground sometime in the future and I won't hold my breath. But this film is one good time of a roller-coaster ride of blood and guts, set an unconventional territory: a desert. Why a desert you may ask? Lets just say its wide open space with little to NO civilization. Got that? Good. Anyhow, The Hills Have Eyes is a fine example of good horror movie-making and its violence will shock and disturb you as it did me (and this is coming from someone who saw it TWICE)!!! It's a shame the characters are vaguely fleshed out; especially the villains , but you get your money's worth in the end. Still I recommend it IF you can stomach it all.",8,0,0,5 June 2008
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," The only good thing about T3 was the ending...
","and that unfortunately, pretty much sums up Rise of the Machines. This film has nothing that made the first two films so great and fun to watch. It's not enough that the writing and the acting sucks, among other things. It just doesn't feel like a 'True' Terminator movie. It's more or less what Joel Schumacher did to the Batman franchise. Kristanna Loken as the female Terminator added absolutely nothing to the role; she's merely a stop-motion puppet with a pretty face parading around in vacant, dramatically vapid scenes with no genuine flair or excitement.Nick Stahl is pretty much a wimpy John Connor rather than a leader. Not even Arnold's role as the titular character can save this train wreck of a celebrated franchise. In fact, the only good thing about T3 was the ending. My advice: Watch the first two films and never, EVER watch this crap fest. The third times not the charm for this one. AT ALL.",4,0,1,21 January 2008
Wanted," Style, class, hard-boiled with sharp acting and plot.
","Adapted from the comic series by Top Cow Productions, 'Wanted' is stylishly engrossing and bad-ass to the bone directed impeccably by Timur Bekmanbetov in his first American film. With a cast of A-list actors like Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie, it's a thrill ride from start to finish. 2008 is shaping up to be the best year for comic book movies from the refuse of last year's cringe-inducing garbage. The acting from the major players is top-notch. However, I found James McAvoy a little irritating at times but he's still solid nonetheless. But it's Freeman and Jolie who steal the show with cunning ruthlessness despite being the good guys of the piece along with impressive stunts mixed with sharp acting and dialog. And what marvelous stunts there are; rivaling those even more-so than the Matrix sequels. Forget 'Live Free or Die Hard' and 'Get Smart'. If you want a serious movie about cold, ruthless assassins without the tongue-in-cheek goofiness of Smart, spit that garbage out and see this movie. Highly recommended!!!",9,3,8,28 June 2008
Salt," Delivers.
","While this film has the tried and true essentials of it's forefathers, it nonetheless sets out to achieve in it's thrilling action and rapid-fire pace. There's a lot to like in this film with it's lead star giving a good performance with everyone on board and the story will keep you engaged throughout the running time. So far I like this. The only gripe that I have is that the film didn't fully explore the protagonist's inner psyche. There are some flashbacks that tell flesh out the character, but a little bit more would've been nice in addition to more exposition surrounding her character. Also, I felt the film should've been longer. The notion of a female spy is an exciting and intriguing idea;having seen so many spy movies with mostly male heroes, this one mixes things up differently. The ending leaves open the possibility of a sequel and I for one can't wait to see what they come up with next. It's not as cerebral as the Bourne films, but it will entertain you for an hour and a half.",7,6,14,8 August 2010
Monsters vs. Aliens," A little underwhelming, but still good fun.
","Okay, I'll admit I'm not big on CG movies as I always find 2D animation much more convincing and involving but I had a good time with this (along with a some relatives) and it's a pretty cool movie. However, I kinda felt a little underwhelmed; the story is good, but there's just wasn't enough substance along with the characters and action. I just felt it needed more. But it's a treat to see all the nods to '50s classic era of films that Monsters Vs Aliens pays homage to along with some good messages about being true to yourself and looking beyond one's appearance in order to know someone. Seeing the film with 3D glasses was a cool idea but in my view, 2D will suffice but still, it's good family entertainment for an afternoon. Hopefully the next film will have more ooomph, more 'Monstrosity'.",7,32,43,6 April 2009
Spider-Man," A great adaptation of one of the most famous superheroes.
","I remember seeing the trailers for this film and I thought: WOW!!! They really pulled off a believable Spider-Man film that does justice to the spirit of the comics and character. Spider-Man is a film that audiences young and old to enjoy, with it's dazzling action sequences, humorous lines and a well-written and exciting plot.Sam Raimi, known for his cult 'Evil Dead' films and the underrated but brilliant 'Darkman' gives the character so much in traits and personality, wit, that it's hard to imagine anyone else that can deliver a Spider-Man film. More often than not, I think this film is a great example how much hard work and devotion is done to make sure that this film is a success. True, some of the shots seem artificial, but what viewers should really focus on is the story and characters, something that moviegoers sometimes fail to do. And with a script like this, you will be too.Like Richard Donner's 'Superman' another film done right, Spider-Man spends a considerable time on the origins of Peter Parker, who is motivated to use his powers for good due to a tragedy in his life. But whereas Superman was brought up to do good by his parents and the values he learned on his time on Earth, Spider-Man was struck by circumstance, both by his surroundings and his personal tragedy. These characters are completely different from each other. But what makes Spider-Man so compelling than Superman is that he's an average, ordinary guy with everyday problems that one day becomes blessed(and to a certain extent, cursed) with an extraordinary gift. His reaction is that of joy and excitement that is shared by everyone in this world when they find themselves doing extraordinary actions. Though not in no way in the context of the real world, but the point still stands. And lets face it we all like to be superheroes some day. Spider-Man gives us the feeling of living out those fantasies in more ways than one.To make a great superhero film, or any film for that matter, you have to have strong actors and Tobey Maguire is by far the best choice for the film. He's really believable as a guy who is shunned by his pears but still is kind-heart and meek, bright. You grow to care for Peter, Mary Jane, Aunt May, Uncle Ben, and Norman Osborne. When a film makes you care for the characters, then you know it's good. As for the action scenes, they are thrilling, exciting, and at times, very brutal. Even though Spider-Man is a bit light-hearted and fun, it can be really intense and scary, which parents ought to be cautious when seeing these films with their children. But despite all this, Spider-Man is still good fun.Now that a reboot is being planned, I'm very excited to see what's next for the Web-Slinger even though I enjoyed the first film along with the second(which I will review later on). The less said about Spidey 3 the better, but Spider-Man is the best one ever made and the sequel is pure magic as a film that surpasses the first one by far.",8,0,1,7 July 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," The most amazing Spider-Man film ever.
","I just came back from seeing 'The Amazing Spider-Man' and in my opinion is the best Spider-Man film ever made; far surpassing even the Sam Raimi films. What Mark Webb has done is nothing short of amazing. He wiped the grime that was Spider-Man 3 from audiences and, like Chris Nolan, gave him a clean slate and made him exist in a world that is highly plausible and believable at the same time. Everything feels real and it just draws you in. Character emotions, action scenes, well written dialog feels real.Part of the reason why this works is because it feels wholly cohesive. Sam Raimi's films were good in their day, but the felt a little too cartoonish and campy though I liked Spider-Man 2 better than part 1. But Webb gives it a more human angle while setting it in a gritty, contemporary world that is haunting and unforgiving.With all that said, it's the acting that's the most impressive. Andrew Garfield thoroughly sets himself up as a more believable Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He's more agile and full of physical action than the one portrayed by Tobey Maguire as well as more emotional and expressive. We see his anguish, his heartbreak, his anger, his frustrations, and determination. But we also see something that has never been touched upon in the previous films: his inventiveness. How he builds his devices in which to fight crime(as well as guarding his privacy) showcases that and I applaud the filmmakers for exploring that bit of the iconic character. Sam Raimi has never done that.Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy does a lot more than she did in Spider-Man 3. In that film she was nothing more than window-dressing and a substitute for when MJ wasn't available to warm Peter's heart, but in this film,she is really caring about Peter and the build up to their relationship is organic and really natural; something that's been missing in Spider-Man 1 and 2. With such well written dialog between the two characters, you really feel for them; almost as if they were real people despite being fictional characters and this film has that nailed down very well.But no Superhero film would not be complete without a superb villain and Rhys Ifans does an incredible performance as the menacing, giant green monstrous Lizard. I so wanted to see this character portrayed on live-action film and thankfully I got that chance. With such believable and realistic CGI, much better than Spidey 1 and 2(though 2 was incredible in it's depiction of Dock Ock)the filmmakers make him more than a worthy adversary for ol' web head to tangle with. I only wish that there was more banter between them in their alter egos. Though I enjoyed their interactions with each other before becoming enemies, I would've loved it if they had more interaction.I was thrilled by the action. I doesn't feel artificial at all; it feels more organic, especially when Spidey is swinging around town, beating up bad guys, or just simply hanging around. No thanks to the state of the art technology powering the film, it's only used to emphasize the film, not completely dry it.I like The Amazing Spider-Man. No, I LOVE IT!!! The best Spider-Man film ever made. Everyone on board has gave the audience an amazing thrill ride from start to finish while also getting into the character's head. I'm really looking forward to see what Marc Webb and the rest of the gang are spinning for the next film. Kudos to everyone involved, The Amazing Spider-Man is truly amazing.",Null,3,7,8 July 2012
The Love Guru," Mr. Myers, Please retire because your career is dire.
","An open letter to Mr. Michael Myers.Dear Mr. Myers.I am writing to inform you that it's the sign of the times and I think you should read and understand what it clearly means in regards to your....career. The years have come and go but unfortunately they have not been kind to cinema and society in general. The reason I'm writing this letter is because I feel that deep in my heart you should SERIOUSLY consider throwing in the towel and find something else worthwhile pursuing; maybe philanthropy perhaps? If you do that not only will people respect you more but it will also help wash away all memories of those years enduring your crap after crap after crap movies. Although I can't see how this can possibly happen overnight if fate and the universe persists, it will be a sigh of relief if it was all the more true.Memories. Oh how profoundly fond those memories are and I recall watching 'Wayne's World' when I was teeny-weeny with a more less jaded view of the world and then came 'Austin Powers'. Ahhh, the laughs those provided to help me drift away from the drudgery of life. Then a funny thing happened and the end result was a horrific turn as a pudgy, sex-innuendo laden feline several years ago. In my mind there's no denying that you should have realized that your career tanked at that point for someone once funny to even remotely consider such a perilous career move. The days of 'Austin Powers' are gone, buddy. GROW UP AND BE A MAN!!!Having read the news a while back of your latest endeavor, I hoped that you'll rebound after such a dog-pile-of-you-know-what of said movie. But alas, my hopes were shattered once again and as I left the theater after witnessing such a travesty of talentless vain proportions, the fragility of my mental state almost reached the breaking point when a good Samaritan saved me from what was, to be precise, an almost life-threatening ordeal. I thanked the good Samaritan of course as any sane individual would do and went our separate ways. But I will never, EVER, thank you for releasing such soul-shattering ineptness garbage that nearly killed me dared to be released for unsuspecting, innocent eyes!!!So in conclusion, after clearing my head of the madness that I suffered, cleansed my spirit as well as my soul, I am now able to return to the outside world once again with the notion that no human being should ever go through such a horrific experience. Although I know that time doesn't heal all wounds but it is known that the human spirit is a remarkable thing that not even the likes of you and the evils of Hollywood inhabiting the blue and green world cannot comprehend. That special someone, that one individual who saved me from the madness you spewed fourth are moments like these that remind me of the good in the world. And for that, I'm grateful.",1,11,23,30 June 2008
District 9," Original and emotionally gripping from start to finish.
","With the recent decline in quality of summer sci-fi blockbusters (Transformers 2, anyone?), it's nice to see a film such as 'District 9' that's original and groundbreaking; with a universe and a web of intrigue that you've never seen before in the sci-fi genre. I won't spoil any details of the plot but I will tell you this: This film is the most emotionally gripping and horrifying experience I've ever had this year. Some parts of the film were unintentionally funny, giving it dose of black comedy that works really well with the grimy, dilapidated slums of South Africa with performances by Wikus Van De Merwe, played brilliantly by Sharlto Copeley. In addition to the well-written script and beautiful direction lies some very original creature designs seemingly inspired by the Cthulu mythos of H.P Lovecraft fame which that are truly terrifyingly realistic. But beneath all the great aspects of this film is the heart of the film showing the good and bad of both sides of the conflict bringing in touching moments of heroism and justice, racial intolerance, isolation, and brutality. Some of the violence is really shocking and disturbing so I advise parents not to let their kids see this one because some of what's up there on screen will really give them nightmares. I have to say this is if you want to see a thought-provoking, original, and gripping sci-fi film, see District 9. One of the best films in the genre of this year.",10,3,7,16 August 2009
Batman Begins," The definitive Batman movie.
","Batman Begins blows Tim Burton/Shumacher movies COMPLETELY out of the water and hands down the best superhero movie I've ever seen...period. It's got it all; action, comedy, drama, suspense and fantasy brought together so eloquently by Christopher Nolan (Memento, The Prestige) along with tight direction, cinematography, and astounding special effects with a sense of verisimilitude so strong and effective throughout it comes together in a stellar package. And Christian Bale is simply superb in the role; making Batman dark and brooding, the way he should be. Many have criticized Katie Holmes, but I liked her in this film (especially in Pieces of April, Abandon, The Gift). The villains also get top billing and are far more menacing and three dimensional than before. The original movies were good in their day but they pale in comparison to what Nolan and co brought to the big screen because staying true to the source material pays off and is more engrossing in the end. Some superhero movies have tried to go the other way around resulting in failure but this film nailed it spot on. My main complaint is the fight scenes were too heavily edited. Hopefully they will be fleshed out in the next film. I enjoyed Spider-Man and X-Men and their sequels (except the third installments) and Iron Man respectively but Batman will always be my favorite superhero and with the sequel approaching this summer, it's gonna be one hell of a treat.",10,3,4,20 April 2008
Blue Crush," A nice little summer movie.
","I remember seeing this movie several years ago and thinking nothing of it, I felt it was gonna be another cheesy teen movie with inane dialog and cliché moments of romance and humor. But low and behold, I was proved wrong. It may not have an award winning screenplay, but the dialog and plot along with some acting performances are decent enough to make the film entertaining than it actually is. What won me over was the cinematography and many will point out that the sound is one of the film's best assets. It was a treat to see this film back in the cinemas so I have no doubt in my mind that that same feeling can be had in the comfort of your own home. While watching this film, you almost feel as if you're in it itself and that's a feat that 'Blue Crush' accomplishes because of it's superb atmosphere. It may have some cliché moments but 'Blue Crush' is a nice movie to kick back to and enjoy. Not a classic by any means, it's entertaining for a nice little, hot summer afternoon.",7,1,1,29 July 2010
28 Days Later...," Best Zombie/Horror/Sci-Fi film I've ever seen.
","I just saw '28 Days Later' for the first time on DVD and I say it's GREAT!!! Danny Boyle has really outdid himself by turning the genre on its head and bringing something new and fresh to audiences and the critics loved it since it's first release back in 2002; especially Ebert&Roeper. True, the plot may be Sci-Fi in nature but on the surface, it's more like a metaphor for all the violence and chaos raging throughout our 'normal' society and is so plausible that its really horrifying and disturbing. The 'Rage' virus captures that dark aspect of humanity and the characters personify it beautifully unlike any Zombie/Horror movie I've ever saw. Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins, Red Eye) is simply awesome as is Naomie Harris, Brendan Gleeson, and Christopher Eccleston, all who give terrific performances. I really liked Megan Burns as Frank's daughter who comes across as resourceful but also vulnerable and innocent. There are many scenes that were shocking and heartbreaking that can make you feel sad and bring you to tears; especially the post-apocalyptic, deserted scenes of London, once teeming with life but is now an empty shell of itself. The only problem I have is that the ending was a little too upbeat. Still, 28 Days Later is the best film of the genre that I ever saw. Watch it on a big-screen TV to get the full effect of this groundbreaking movie.Superbly awesome. Best I've ever seen in years.",9,1,2,25 June 2008
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," An excellent start to a future franchise.
","Despite not being a sequel to Tim Burton's film, I found this one very enjoyable even though I enjoyed Burton's film on some levels and on it's merits alone. With everything being established so far, it's all falling into place; starting with the one stone that causes a ripple in a pond. The pond that is mankind. A pond that is civilized by the laws created by man, but in actuality is as primitive and violent as nature and the many creatures that inhabit it. What this film does is give the viewer intense retrospection into our own collective mentality and society as a whole. Man has killed, enslaved, and brutalize each other for centuries and continue to do so under foolish, violent, and selfish reasons. Are we, as the human race, that much different from animals? Are we really the dominant species that we purport ourselves to be? Or are we so blind in our own arrogance and self-contempt that we fail to see the error of our own collective psyche? Those are the questions that abound in this film with a script and acting to further them into the overall story. The story is simple, but as it goes on, it becomes more and more complex as the intelligence of the apes increase to extraordinary and dangerous levels which lead to catastrophic results for the human race. Though I liked James Franco's performance, I was really touched by John Lithgow's character as the father suffering from Altzeimher's disease. It felt so real, so emotional, that it was almost unbearable to sit through. Fortunately, there's some humorous moments to lighten up a tense, dark story. My only gripe is Frieda Pinto's character; she doesn't seem all that fitting to be the love interest of the protagonist. To me, she was the weakest link to the movie, but thankfully that's only a minor quibble that I have with.Although I(along with many others) have praise for this film, I suppose some say it's more or less on par with Burton's film; which despite it's own merits and awesome premise with beautiful set design and well-written dialog, failed to really connect with the audience on an emotional level. But with this film, it makes much more of an impression by giving us a real emotional connection with the apes and human characters. This can be attributed to the fact that it's set in our modern world, rather than a planet far away, giving the film a sense of realism that the previous film lacked. If there's any indication that a film of this quality can have the success that it has already achieved, then it's a sure bet that more good things are to come in future films as mankind finds itself awakening to a whole new reality, one in which it's core foundation will be ultimately challenged.",Null,0,1,20 August 2011
2012," At least I saw it for free.
","I really don't know what to make of this 'film'. True, it's not something to be taken seriously but at least they could've gave some background info on the proceedings leading up to the 'event'. I for one like end of the world movies with well-written stories and plausible scenarios. If you come into this film and expect to see plausibility on a global scale, you will be sorely disappointed. The special effects are pretty good, I'll give it that but take my word for this: There are many MANY times were you'll see characters make some illogical decisions and actions that completely make no sense whatsoever. It's also really sad to see some very fine actors like Danny Glover, Thandie Newton, and John Cusack being wasted in a vapid, lifeless screenplay written by an equally talentless and execrable team of screenwriters and producers.It's really amazing that the film eschews the most intriguing part of the film in favor of loud noise; the nature of the Mayan calendar which has so much more historical power and mystery than this entire debacle put together. Deep Impact, released several years ago, had much more scientific fact and intrigue and was far more plausible and dire in emotional impact. This film has emotional impact on the scale of a crying 3 year old boy to the tenth power. Bloated and cooked to imperfection is what I like to call this film. Do yourself a favor and watch the Discovery and History channel instead. You'll find much more scientific and historical fact than this steaming pile of turd. This is a piece of propaganda, forged from the flatulent fires of Roland Emmerich which despite it's title, serves nothing more than a sequel to his previous disaster film.Well, at least I saw it for free.",3,1,1,22 November 2009
X-Men: The Last Stand," The captain (YES YOU Ratner!!!) should've went down with his ship.
","Shocking. Shocking beyond belief. Right up there with the Hindenburgh disaster 40 years ago. This (final?) third installment of the critically praised first two films is proof in that comparison. Was it writer's block that fumbled this film? Was it sheer ineptness? Lack of any real genuine motivation or conviction? Or was it to simply make money; at the cost of artistic value? It's all of the above, unfortunately clearly as in the case of this film.The plot: Poorly executed and lopsided. Since Brian Singer had great respect for the material and was deeply passionate on his craft, very little if any respect is given to the film whatsoever. Brett Ratner's take on X-men is more in line with commercial interests in mind and it is very apparent throughout the entire film; namely that of the new characters such as Angel, Beast, Juggernaut, Multiple Man, and Leech. Barely any of them as well as Storm or Kitty Pride get a chance to develop due to the hyperactive, ADD-infused screenplay with no backbone. Never do the audience get an insight into the inner workings of the actual plot (or lack thereof) and atmosphere that made parts 1 and 2 so riveting.The acting: With regards to Halle Berry, the beautiful actress who won an Oscar for her performance in 'Monster's Ball' is still awfully restrained and wooden in X3. I found it hard to emote with her simply because all her lines were spoken as if they were read off of cue cards as things went along. The screenwriters and Ratner make a HUGE critical mistake of reducing Cyclops (James Marsden) for lack of a better term a 'token character' who gets 'cop'd out' early in the film. This is also true of Famke Janssen as the Dark Phoenix, a mutant with astronomically astounding psionic powers. Her scenes with Cyclops and Wolverine were so lifelessly stilted it almost felt as if I was watching Charlie Chaplin for the first time. It's a shame the producers couldn't elaborate more on her character or ANY of the old and new mutants for that matter and that's why the film suffers for those very same reasons.Continuity errors: Oh my. There are so many in abundance, I'll just note some of them; especially the scene where Magneto (played excellently by Ian McKellan) uses his magnetic powers to move the Golden Gate bridge when day INSTANTLY turns to night. The first time I saw that scene, I nearly burst into laughter and tears and as far back as I can remember, I don't think I was ever alone at the time it happened and when the Juggernaut said 'Do you know who I am? I'm the Juggernaut, bitch!!!, I completely lost it. Personally, I don't know why the Danger Room was included, other than to be 'just another cool effect'. with no rationale behind it all. Frankly, showing the mutants on a coffee break should suffice. One thing I can't do is accuse the film of lacking action. The action scenes and special effects are simply impressive. Watching them was like witnessing a very good fireworks display with the wide eyes of a child. Yes the film has some very good action scenes but even they couldn't save this film from mediocrity.X-Men 3: The Last Stand is the worst movie in the franchise...period. None of the awe, mystery, and magic are in this film. Brett Ratner butchered the treasured mythology of these classic mutants into a bloody, incoherent mess. This crap-fest should be done. Done.And one more thing: Iron Man grossed more money than X3. YES!!!!!!!",3,3,5,3 June 2008
I Am Legend," Will Smith is incredible!!!
","I have never read Richard Matheson's groundbreaking novel of the same name but I still like the film despite not knowing of its existence and never having the chance of reading the original source material on which the film (and its countless variations) is based. Will Smith is incredible. A fine actor that he is in bringing genuine anxiety and bleak outlooks in this post-apocalyptic tale of being the last man on earth. The scenes of a deserted NYC is so shocking and disturbing that after seeing the film, I deeply pondered if such an event was to happen suddenly without warning; really intense stuff. But I gotta say the best supporting 'actor' in Legend is Sam, soul mate of the weary (and somewhat crazy) protagonist in a desperate race to save humanity from extinction. Their scenes together form a lovingly heartwarming bond that is the emotional center of Legend.Will Smith is a joy to watch, especially when he's going through his 'daily routines' while trying to find a sense of normalcy of the world that once was and you really emphasize with his struggle against loneliness, insanity and despair. I don't think they couldn't have gotten a better actor for this role but thankfully I'm glad that they took him aboard this film as a bankable and talented actor.However the film does have its faults. Many complained about the special effects being to 'video-gamey' and it's length. Unlike most, I'm willing to overlook the special effects though I find them exceptional at best. It's a real shame that the film's length wasn't longer. It would've been great if the film had an extra hour of story and giving a much more satisfying experience; sadly it doesn't and the ending does feel like a cop-out. Still it is a good movie. It should be interesting to see what the special edition has to offer for the added scenes and bonus content.I rate it 8 out of 10.",7,0,5,17 May 2008
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Surpasses the first film in many ways than one.
","Having just seen ASM 2, I say wholeheartedly that the second film is leagues BETTER than the first film. There's more drama, suspense, some dark moments, but perhaps the same comic-book like feel; something that Sam Raimi's films had, but never really delivered on it's premise. Thankfully however, Mark Webb and co, gave us a film that will be remembered for ages.Even though there are three villains in this film, they are all superbly developed and well acted, something Sam Raimi's infamous Spiderman 3 SPECTACULARLY FAILED TO DO on SO MANY LEVELS. This film when you watch it gives you the sense that the movie is more understandable and therefore plausible in it's premise and execution. True, there are some rough spots in the film, but that does not in any way, shape, or form, take away from the experience.One has to feel bad for Shailene Woodley, who was supposed to appear in the film as Mary Jane, Spidey's love interest for the uninitiated, but given how many characters and subplots are in the film, this was a wise decision on the film -makers part; after all, we wouldn't want to suffer through the same fate as Spiderman 3, would we? And unlike James Franco's take on Harry Osborne, Dane DeHaan gives a MUCH better performance. With his menacing stare and cold, blue eyes, he felt really intimidating as Spidey's future foe.The action scenes are really spectacular and no pun intended, AMAZING!!! Never once was I bored throughout the entire runtime of the film. It's properly paced and intrinsically plotted with hints and bits of pieces for die-hard Spidey fans to discover; with some Easter eggs thrown in for good superhero measure. Tight direction and well choreographed, there's a great sense of tension and excitement to behold the on screen hijinks. I liked some of the slow-motion shots and they highlight the action; giving the film depth in it's perception of character and action-driven scenes and although not everyone will find them to their tastes, I think they work wonderfully in showcasing Spidey's acrobatic abilities which are greatly taken from the awesome source material.So is The Amazing Spiderman 2 better than the first one? The overall answer is an AMAZINGLY enthusiastic YES!!! Mark Webb has done a really good job on giving us a sequel that goes in-depth of Peter Parker's psyche while also giving ample screen time to the villains and other character's involved in the titular hero's life. If the ending is anything to go by(which I will not spoil by any means) then we can expect more greater things to come in the overall narrative of this rebooted series. For once, three villains on screen are given screen time of character development and to be fair, it was a huge risk, but the risk payed off thanks in part to the well-written(and at times, humorous) plot and screenplay. Best sequel to a beloved superhero I've ever seen and by the impressively AMAZING box-office results, roll on Amazing Spiderman 3!!! Great job everyone!!! Great and AMAZING job!!!",9,4,12,11 May 2014
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A true gem in and of itself.
","I just came back from seeing The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button and never once did it feel dragged down or contrived; like so many other dramas that came out last year. Never has a film been so original, so groundbreaking, so touching and heartfelt at the same time while giving best performances all around from Cate Blanchett and of course, most of all, Brad Pitt. The most remarkable thing about this film is the progression of events that flow so naturally, from different time periods and the 'aging' of the main character. But none of these things would matter had it not been for David Fincher's taut, ingenuity, masterful direction with a first rate screenplay by Eric Roth. For once, special effects don't overshadow the story and drama; they mainly serve them. And they are indeed wonderful. A true gem in and of itself. This film teaches us to value life and the time that we are given in this harsh, cruel world. But most of all, it tells us that no matter how old we get, love is forever boundless.",9,1,4,10 January 2009
Transformers," Love and hate relationship.
","Transformers, whether you love it or hate, is a somewhat decent film but could've been a lot better had the direction and writing been a little more fleshed out and coherent. True there are some great action scenes but they all (once again) suffer from that tried and tested 'MTV style' editing that makes it so hard to appreciate the action. I can name many sci-fi action films that have much better action scenes than Transformers but I'm not going to as I felt I should keep this review short and sweet as others have pointed out the many flaws in this film; some of which I will list here. Having just seen the second film a week ago, I'm just gonna say this one was much better than the second one, why? Well, I just feel that this one has a much better focus on the story,not that there's really is a story to begin with, but it just jived with me for some unknown reason. I don't know, but I just feel this one is much better. On that note, Transformers is not as bad as the second one but Revenge of the Fallen was the pits as far as I'm concerned. If you seen the first film and are eager to see the second, then go ahead but I rather see Transformers again (on DVD) then revisit ROTF. Not good or bad, just 'okay'.Final note: I hope they replace Michael Bay with the third film and get the writers from the 'Beast Wars' series. MUCH better than Orci and Kurtzman 100%.",7,0,1,22 July 2009
Children of Men," The best post-apocalyptic film of the year.
","When I first heard about this film, I was like 'another typical Hollywood apocalypse film'. But upon actually seeing it, however, my expectations were more than confounded.With 'Children of Men', Alphonso Cauron has created a visually stunning and thought-provoking film. This is a film that just grabs your attention and doesn't let up until the final moment. And it's a dozen times more interesting than 'Apocalypto' and the Matrix sequels. From the cinematography to the well-written plot along with top-notch performances from Clive Owen, Julianne Moore and Clair Hope (in a breakout role)adds up to a poignant and thrilling experience. I must admit that the film was slow at first, but patience (to this viewer, don't know about anyone else) is rewarded when the story gathers momentum. The film's imagery is superb and the best of any post-apocalyptic film, past and present. Scenes of human misery and decadence are haunting and disturbing.In contrast to '28 Days Later' and other post-apocalyptic films, I suppose some will stay away from this film, which is a shame because its one of the best films of this genre. I suspect that the film may be hitting a little to close to home in their mindset. And they may be right; especially in this day and age where the thought of society on the brink of self-destruction is becoming brought more and more into fruition. The film may be sci-fi in nature, but its sense of verisimilitude is a stark reminder of our chaotic world.Go see this film and let it give you food for thought. You won't regret it.",9,2,6,20 January 2007
The Dark Knight," Surpasses 'Begins' in every aspect!!!
","Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy 'The Dark Knight' EXCEEDED all  of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman  franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it,  amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more  gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times  throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to  fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if  his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his  fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the  help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael  Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But  the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly  enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack  Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker.  He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY  disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime  and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original  cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal  and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a  much better performance and is a far cry from the 'damsel-in-distress'  stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in  films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around  more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly  improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than 'Begins'  in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal.  Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the  film an added frosting to an already delicious cake.  Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than 'Begins.' The  action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud  Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who  sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing  in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may  feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I  will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor  him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a  human being and father to his daughter Matilda  Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his  daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this  role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented  actor.  Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008.",10,2382,3422,7 July 2008
Taken," Great action movie.
","Liam Neeson, one of the best talented veteran actors, gives a surprisingly good performance in this film. I never thought that Neeson could be so impressive in an action movie, up until now. Here he demonstrates a mastery of brutal action combat but also showing his softer side with one of the best line delivery in the entire film and with tight direction and class by the hands of Luc Besson. It's true that there are some cliché's in the film but it never overshadows the overall product. It also shows a brief glimpse of the human trafficking trade that's very seldom seem or even reported about in today's news and it's that aspect that I applaud the filmmakers for. I was a little letdown that the film doesn't dig too deeper into Neeson's character and the human trafficking trade so hopefully we'll see a director's cut in the future but for what it's worth this film is a blast and overall it's nice to see Neeson in a role we haven't seem him in before.",8,0,0,22 February 2009
Avatar," Simply awesome.
","You gotta hand it to James Cameron. The man has a knack for spinning a fantastically wonderful tale with some of the most cutting edge special effects ever put on film. Most of the time, I couldn't tell what was real and what was not. THAT is the beauty of a special effect. It serves the story and is believable unlike the crap in Transformers 2. But the most important aspect of all this, from the acting and dialog is the story. The story, simply put, resonates so closely with our real-world and it's historical context; most notably when mankind exploited and destroyed the environment for profit at the cost of human lives. It's really refreshing and interesting to see a film that challenges and criticizes our capitalistic, militaristic, and imperialistic attitude and ambitions, at a time when our collective conscience is slowly but surely blinding us from the truth. This is a wonderful film with a wonderful message and I for one am glad I saw it because it reminds me of just how beautiful and fragile our world is and in order to ensure that beauty lasts for generations, we all must do our part to make it happen.This films got it all. Intrigue and mystery, suspense, humor, action, romance and just pure fun. Although I would've liked more background info on the planet and it's inhabitants but sometimes it's good to be teased or in this case, kept in the dark about it's eccentricities. Hopefully we'll see a follow-up to this grand and epic tale that will flesh out more of Pandora and judging by the film's phenomenal box-office performance, it's highly likely it will come into fruition. But until then, I will come back to see it again for the second time. A third and fourth viewing is not out of the question. One of the best Sci-Fi films I've ever seen and ranks up there with the best movies of the decade.",9,2,6,10 January 2010
Limitless," Well-written and thrillingly acted.
","One of the most endearing surprises of the year. What this film does is take an original premise, and turns it on it's head in ways I never thought possible. I enjoyed this flick from the opening scenes which let's the audience(finally) to get into the main character's head and strangely enough, we end up rooting for him as his life is constantly in danger from unknown assailants and to a greater extent, himself. That's what makes the narrative arc of this film so compelling. The drug itself is simple yet detailed enough to be explained to any interested viewer. On top of that, what makes this film so refreshing is that there's no huge explosions and gratuitous sex scenes that are so prevalent in Hollywood films. In fact this film is almost an anti-Hollywood film and that in this day and age is a MAJOR plus. If you want to see a well-written and thrillingly acted film, see 'Limitless'. One of the best thrillers I've seen this year.",8,0,1,27 March 2011
Thor," Thunderously entertaining and heartwarming.
","The big bad boy of Asgard swings a mighty force of reckoning in cinema with the release of Thor, based on the Marvel comic character of the same name. With so many great performances from the Hemsworth, Portman, Hiddleston, and of course, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Thor is thundering with acting and suspense.I can't tell you how much I like this film. There are so many parallels to religious and even familiar territory that's covered in another well-known Superhero flick such as Superman. The beginning of the film is somewhat similar to that of Superman. But whilst the Man of Steel is an alien, Thor, on the other hand, is the son of an Norse god. That's where the similarities end for Thor is set in a mystical and real world with it's own characters and dangers that Thor comes into conflict and contact with.I can't say that I'm familiar with Norse mythology. I'm quite certain that this film takes several liberties from it's mythical background on which it's based. But that alone should not deter anyone from seeing this film and Thor is a worthy addition to an already stellar lineup of films based on Marvel's comic properties; namely that of Spider-Man, X-Men, and Iron Man on which Thor is rightly on par with.Speaking of Norse mythology, I can't quite understand why some are in uproar of the casting of Idris Elba as Heimdall. Even though I'm not familiar with the comic, or Norse mythology, I do know that Heimdall is a Norse god who is white. In my mind, Idris Elba does a wonderful job in his portrayal of one of Thor's most trusted allies. Similarly, this dates back to Daredevil(another film based on the Marvel character) when Michael Clark Duncan was chosen to play the Kingpin, whose background was that of Anglo-European descent. I have no qualms over who portrays these characters as long as they deliver the goods, but overall, Elba did a great job and in that regard, Heimdall is a force to be reckoned with.Natalie Portman has been quite busy this year; what with her recent outstanding performance in Black Swan, she adds another dimension of charm and love as Thor's love interest. Essentially the 'Lois Lane' of Thor, she is the only human companion our fabled hero has. As hard as it was for Thor to adjust to the daily conumdrums of our world, she's there to help him alleviate some of the muck he has to wade through. I couldn't think of anyone else for the role other than Portman. She's simply great. But it is Tom Hiddleston who really steals the show as Loki, the bad boy of Asgard. Like Heath Ledger's Joker, Hiddleston will no doubt be talked about among comic fans and moviegoers alike with his sinister personality and brash arrogance towards Thor and their conflicts with each other are just....thundering.With all this added up, Thor is simply one of the best comic-book movies of this year. They(Marvel) took another obscure superhero and turned him into a force to be reckoned with at the box-office. See it on Imax to get the full effect of this smash hit. No doubt you will leave the theater with a thunderous smile on your face.",8,6,12,8 May 2011
Zombieland," Darkly humorous romp through a zombie-infested America.
","Having not seen 'Zombieland' on it's first day of release, I decided to watch it on DVD this night and I was pleasantly entertained yet strangely surprised at how touching and warm it could be.Jesse Eisenberg plays Columbus, an average Joe who has always wanted a family and to score with a girl. Eisenberg as well as Woody Harrelson(especially Harrelson) give great performances throughout the whole course of the perilous trek with a dash of dark comedy and zombie bashing. There's very little visual effects, but that it's used sparingly is really effective as it lets the audience focus on the great aspects of this film: characters and a well-written and darkly witty script. The story's a bit thin but in the context of the whole film, it works unlike some other films that try to be fun and smart, but end up failing in all levels.I really missed out on this film on it's theatrical fun but fortunately I watched recently and I got to say that Zombieland simply rocks. Black comedy mixed with well-written dialog, zombie bashing, and some touching moments, Zombiland is a blast.",8,0,1,27 February 2011
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Revenge of the cliché's.
","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is the complete opposite of what a film is supposed to be and fails completely when it tries to appeal to all audiences. In fact it is like being served a dish that has everything undesirable: Racial stereotypes (which are a plenty here), confusing fight scenes, incoherent plot with numerous plot holes and a surprising amount of foul language that serves no purpose to the story (if you can call it a story) and soulless depictions of females, sugar-coated to perfection with the IQ of a dinosaur; Michael Bay to be precise. True, the film sometimes has it's moments but it is completely sidetracked with the most inane and just sheer stupid actions especially with Sam's parents and then later on his roommates or should I say complete refuses of society. Megan Fox is nothing more than window dressing but what can you expect when her character has nothing to do but pose like a Playboy magazine photo shoot. As for the robots, Starscream, Megatron, and The Fallen get more lines of dialog but this film commits the same sin as the first one did. None of the new robots get any chance to develop. This is due to the fact that Bay assumes everyone saw the first film so therefore he felt he didn't need to develop any of the other robots aside from Optimus Prime and Megatron. The first film wasn't nothing special, it had it's charms but after repeated viewings it gets worn out real fast like a new pair of shoes. Wow, that's ten bucks and 2 hours and 30 minutes of my life that I will never get back. Save your money and buy the old animated series and the Beast War series. Those ancient cartoons can run circles around this piece of trash.Avoid at all costs.",3,1,6,19 July 2009
War of the Worlds," Tom Cruise shines despite his bizarre behavior.
","The original War of the Worlds was great, but I like this version even more, mostly because the story and special effects have been updated, but still pay homage to H.G Wells' original vision. Tom Cruise gives a great performance in this film even though his behavior in the media has been questionable. Also worth mentioning is Dakota Fanning (Man on Fire, Charlotte's Web) who also gives a strong performance. Some may say that her performance is a little OTT, but for me, it works really well. As said before, the special effects and story are top-notch and there are some disturbing images that may be too intense for children. My only gripes was the ending and a brief role by Tim Robbins. The ending was a little out of place for me; they've should have had a better, more tragic conclusion. As for Tim Robbins, I felt his role was too brief and not fleshed out more. He's one of my old favorites.War of the Worlds is a good sci-fi film to enjoy at least once.",8,3,6,25 December 2006
Hancock," It's a good movie and I liked it; could've used more oomph.
","Hancock is original. It's not Marvel or DC but it wears it's comic book adventure elements on it's sleeve in live-action form. Will Smith gives a good performance as well as Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron (DAMN this woman is SEXY!!) admirably. I enjoyed the action and touching moments Hancock and the special effects are good in a naturalistic setting with some well-timed comedic moments thrown in. The fact that it's not an entirely superhero movie is also a plus and that makes it stand out a little amongst the big-name superhero movies coming out this summer; namely Hellboy 2 and The Dark Knight. However, the only fault in Hancock is that there's no real central villain and not enough info on Will and Theron's origins and the possibilities of others like them (especially towards the climax). There's no doubt I couldn't help but feel that some juicy material was removed from the final cut. So in all respects, Hancock is a good film and I must say that I liked it and is original in it's presentation but the film could've used more oomph, content wise. I'm sure it made a lot at the box-office and got good reviews. Only time will tell if it's successful enough to warrant a sequel.",7,0,1,13 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The third times the charm!!!
","I remember going to the theater, butterflies in my stomach, towards the release of the final Star Wars movie in fear of being disappointed after the bitter taste of the prequels. Talk about a great movie; it was the BEST one out of them all!!! Can't believe I'm saying this but this one recaptured that vibe that was sorely missing in the first two films!!! For once, more attention is paid to the story and characters rather than bang and boom and most importantly of all, it didn't cater to the child demographic. There's some faults with the dialog, but they're rarely mentioned and don't hurt the overall product. A plus. This is the darkest, morally and emotionally complex of the prequel trilogy with scenes that can actually make you feel sad and heartbreaking thanks in part to the script and performances out of the lead players in this tale of galactic conflict dipped in space-opera fudge. And Ian McDiarmid is simply great as the evil Emperor Palpatine. And last but not least, Jar Jar is barely seen in the film although in my heart I wished he was 'vindicated'.What a refreshing experience!!! It may not be the best Star Wars film but its a HELLUVA LOT BETTER than what came before!!! For once Mr. Lucas, thank you. Thanks for everyone on board for recapturing the magic of my childhood memories. Thank you.",9,2,4,28 May 2008
Inception," A mesmerizing labyrinth of sheer genius.
","I got to say that this is hands down THE best film of the year. Not since the days of Kubrick and Hitchcock has a thriller been this dazzling, perplexing, emotional, and ultimately satisfying. I've since longed for a highly intelligent film of both filmmaker's caliber and having been anxious in anticipation, I've finally gotten it in the form of acclaimed director Christopher Nolan's 'Inception'. I am so very pleased.I have to admit it was very confusing at first but as it went along, I got more and more involved and understood what was happening. The first hour sets up the premise superbly without resorting to cheap, cliché' gimmicks like most Hollywood blockbusters and that's a plus; considering this film is from a talented group of craftsman who truly put a lot of thought and conviction into this film. What a screenplay!!! Truly inventive. I've never been this intrigued since the first time I saw 'Blade Runner'. Along with the talented performances of Leo Dicaprio, Ellen Page, and of course, Marion Cotillard, unique premise, tightly written and intelligently thought-out script, and the brilliant action and special effects, is the core essence of the human mind. This film is cerebral to the core as it explores our inner thoughts in ways that have never before been seen in any film. What dreams are and how they define us is one of the many themes that are covered in 'Inception'. What drives our virtues, our feelings, our perception of the world around us? Are we truly who we think we are, or are we mere shadows of what we are. Those are the many questions that are prevalent in 'Inception'.As good as the Matrix was, I enjoyed it for it's take on our perceptions of reality but it pales in comparison to the brilliance of Nolan's masterpiece because it goes places a lot deeper than that film put together. The Matrix films barely scratched the surface of what is the difference between the real world and the world of dreams. In the case of 'Inception' Nolan's vision has taken us to a world that not only is fantastic but almost entirely plausible. And that's a feat that even The Matrix couldn't accomplish. The very ideas that abound in Nolan's masterpiece are taken in so many exciting yet treacherous directions and that's why I wholeheartedly recommend you see this film. Ambitious and oozing with style, 'Inception' has earned it's place as one of the top sci-fi thrillers in the history of cinema.",10,2,8,25 July 2010
WALL·E," Charlie Chaplin is to cinema as WALL-E is to animation.
","Every once in a while something comes along that wows you in such a way it becomes an unforgettable experience upon first viewing. When a film or any piece of art leaves an ultimate stamp on your psyche, you can't help but smile with nostalgia and euphoric abandon. WALL-E achieves all that and more. With little to no dialog, the movie holds its own; even against 'Kung Fu Panda, and that's a film coming from Dreamworks of all things. Audiences will find a lot to love about this ingenious and charismatic robotic character with all his perks, quirks, mannerisms, all in a semi-realistic/sci-fi setting. I'm not a huge fan of CGI animated features but this one captivated me not because of it's originality, but also because the main character is a robot which most people have trouble sympathizing with, mainly because they're used to so many animated animals and people (though there are some humans in WALL-E). But the human characters don't overshadow the experience at all. Simply put a great film with terrific character development and a story so heartfelt and engrossing I'm sure it will make tons of money at the box office.Here's to Disney for bringing something new to the table. There may be some similarities in terms of appearance to Johnny 5 of 'Short Circuit' fame but WALL-E is his own character and he's definitely more lovable than said automaton. Anyone who appreciates great film-making or animation with a dash of wholesome family entertainment should see this film. WALL-E is to animation as Charlie Chaplin is to cinema. Don't miss it!!!",10,2,5,28 June 2008
Prometheus," A sci-fi marvel that raises more questions and leaves you with more.
","Ridley Scott made it no secret when he announced that he was making a prequel that hearkens back to the mythology of the 'Alien' trilogy of films(let s forget the abysmal Alien: Resurrection and the AVP films). I'd say that it sets up things really well, introducing new characters, settings, plot points that tie nicely into the mythos while also building suspense and tension throughout the course of events and giving brief hints and homages to the trilogy.Unlike most of the reviewers here on IMDb, I think this film has the potential to build upon and offer something great in the future. It's no perfect film; there are some plot points that I felt were rushed and not developed enough. Maybe we can attribute this to studio execs pressuring Mr. Scott into shortening the length of the film. Hopefully we'll get to see a director's cut that will allow us to experience the film-maker's original vision. But I for one like the film with it's great acting from all actors on-board, script, and wonderfully detailed and darkly vivid set designs with some truly horrifying creature design and animation. Prometheus is a marvel and whether or not you agree or disagree is truly up to the viewer.",8,1,8,24 June 2012
Wonder Woman," Wonderful.
","Wonder Woman, a superhero, beloved by millions of adoring fans from all over the world, FINALLY makes her TRUE cinematic debut; excusing the limited amount of screen time in BVS, which was awesome, BTW. Having grown up on the TV series, various cartoons starring the Amazing Amazon; especially the incredible Justice League animated series and feature films, I can say wholeheartedly that this is by far her best movie.Raised as a princess on the fabled island of Themyscira, Diana sets out to be a hero among the world of man, which has been fraught with brutality, violence, and war. Will she succeed, or fail? When Gal Gadot was cast as the titular heroine, many doubted she could pull of the role; mainly due to not just acting, but also the physicality of it as for years, Wonder Woman has been depicted as tall, muscular, and voluptuous. Keep in mind, that was and is the comics version, but when she showed up in Bvs, everyone was BLOWN AWAY!! Not only is she physically capable in the role, but also bringing to it emotion, heart, vulnerability, and of course, good 'ol fashion asskicking.Most of the other cast are really good in their roles. Chris Pine, David Thewlis, and Connie Nielson, all turn in great performances as Steve Trevor, Hippolyta,and Sir Patric respectfully. I really enjoyed the scenes set during World War 1, as the costumes and mannerisms, and weaponry are historically accurate. But like with any comic book movie, several liberties are taken, which is to be expected of the genre, but do nothing to dampen the overall experience. The only issues I can think of are certain scenes that have no explanation; especially when one of Diana's beloved friends meets an untimely demise, no scene of presenting the Lasso of Truth, and WW's iconic spin. Had those scenes been in the movie, it would've been really awesome; not only for paying homage to the comics, but the iconic TV series starring Lynda Carter as well.Action, romance, humor, some touching moments, but still that rocket-fire fuel of comic book action is all here and there and the direction of Patty Jenkings really makes it come to life on the big screen. Wonder Woman is the best film starring the titular heroine we all know and love. Though it's a bummer we didn't get a end credits scene, the film's box-office success is more than assurance that this won't be the last we see of Wonder Woman.Go see this film. It's really good.",9,8,18,11 June 2017
X-Men: First Class," Best X-Men film ever.
","Just came back from seeing X-Men: First Class and to say that I was impressed would be an understatement. More than impressed. I was invigorated and excited at the same time; mainly due to the fact that Matthew Vaugn has done a remarkable job on the characterizations of the heroes and villains of this wondrous comic-book flick. This film wipes all of the crude and horrid memories of X-Men: The Last Stand. A much more focused and character-driven piece of epic cinema, X-Men: First Class rightfully deserves all the credit it gets from mainstream audiences and comic-book fans alike.I'm not quite sure why there would be an uproar on the costumes that our heroes wear, but it really works; especially in the context in which the story is set that spans from the early days of World War 2 to the turbulent 1960's. Although some of the scenes play out like a certain spy series, nevertheless First Class has it's own vibe, tone, and mood. Already I'm pumped to see the next installment of the X-Men's early days of fighting for a world that once accepted them as saviors of a international crisis, but a dark cloud awaits them all, hero and villain alike.So is First Class better than The Last Stand? The answer is an overwhelmingly exuberant YES!!!! Miles ahead of Brett Ratner's schlock at what Bryan Singer accomplished. Matthew Vaugn has brought an integrity, dignity, and most important of all: heart. A true testament of the spirit of the X-Men comics that encompasses a wide variety of issues plaguing mankind that exists in this day and age. First Class is first rate entertainment for not only just the action, but also the brain. See it. It's worth every penny.",9,1,3,18 June 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," The legend ends on a very high note.
","What measures the quality of a classic, literary work of art? Is it the actors? Is it the writing? Is it the cinematography? Or is it the hard work and dedication into making it go out on a high note that is more important? It's all of these things and thankfully, for the first time ever, a superhero epic that began in 2005, is now something truly special that will be remembered for years; perhaps even decades to come.For many, this will be a journey that has touched many lives in the process, whether they be comic-book fans, casual audiences, or just those who want to see a really good story come to life from the 2-dimensional illustrations of comic panels to the big screen and I for one, was emotional at the beginning, middle, and end of this grand, spectacular conclusion to the journey of one of the most celebrated superheroes of all time. For all the years, he has entertained us, inspired us, even moved us as the light and dark of humanity was artfully and cleverly explored thru the heroes and villains of this tragic tale of a tormented soul who has truly risen up to preserve what humanity has left in the place he calls home: Gotham City.For everyone involved, a masterful work of everything that makes a hero, whether he be fictional or not, drives him/herself towards such selfless acts, although there are those who do it for their own selfish purposes. Some for good, some for evil, or for those who want a clean slate and a new lease on life. And with such careful and painstaking craftsmanship to avoid the pitfalls that other films have succumbed to, the filmmakers have done tremendous and success is rewarded for such hard work and dedication. And for once, for the first time ever, they gave us a Gotham unlike any other seen in the previous series: A post-apocalyptic Gotham City that is besieged by the monstrous intellectual brute that is Bane. A force of nature that not even The Dark Knight could stop. Or could he?But for all that, it still left a heavy feeling in my heart that this is, indeed, the last film in the series and there's no doubt that it left a few tears in the eyes of those who had the privilege to see it with their own eyes. However, I think it's best that people remember this film forever now as it is. No one wants to mess up a good thing; albeit a very good thing with this series. But should the series continue(and I doubt that it will) it will have HUGE shoes to fill and surpass anything that came before it. But for now, we should forever hold the journey of this tragic, yet heroic figure in our memories, hearts, and souls, for as long as we can. Farewell to all. Most importantly, thank you Mr. Nolan and Mr. Bale for all the wonderful, epic entertainment that has the power to make audiences think, feel, and discuss. For today, and forever more, you had made Batman relevant again.Thank You.",10,2,8,21 July 2012
Iron Man," All I can say is Marvel has redeemed itself!!!
","Spider-Man 3 and Ghost Rider SUCKED to the highest extent of the comic-to-movie craze of the millennium. 2007 was a bad year for superhero movies so I came in with low expectations to see Iron Man. The previews looked good but I feared I will be disappointed again and suspect that Marvel has lost its touch after the first two Spider-Man and X-Men films. Well, to be honest I was THOROUGHLY impressed and ENTERTAINED at the same time!!! This film EASILY blows those two crapfests mentioned earlier out of the water completely with an intelligent and well written plot, good acting, action, special effects and most importantly character development, something Sider-Man 3 completely neglected to do. The less said about Ghost Rider the better. But the real star of the show is no doubt the unlikely casting choice of Mr. Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark/Iron Man. His performance really caught me off guard in almost every aspect as a charming, no-nonsense, weapons-making womanizer whose at first glance 'imbeded' with man's destructive nature but ultimately rises with a heart of gold. Gwyneth Paltow is both sexy and sweet as Stark's secretary who keeps him from slipping further; nice to see a woman whose smart and sexy with real depth in a comic book movie. Jon Favreau's direction is top-notch and knows the material well; moreover, this is the first Marvel film made independently of any major studio. I also like that the Iron Man armor is a combination of CGI and practical effects, helped along by Stan Winston, the king of practical movie effects and his work and attention to detail is very impressive as shown in the past. Though there's lots of humor in Iron Man, it never becomes overbearing and OTT like Spider-Man 3 whose idea of humor is more on the lines of an SNL sketch. My only negatives are some underdeveloped characters and the liberties taken with the Iron Man comics (Tony Stark being captured in Afghanistan rather than Vietnam, not delving into his alcoholism) but those are miner hiccups in an otherwise stellar movie.In conclusion: Iron Man is the best Marvel movie made and I'm eagerly awaiting future installments and after seeing this awesome film I can say wholeheartedly and sincerely that Marvel has truly redeemed itself. See it and be blown away!!!",8,4,10,29 April 2008
Blade Runner," Like wine that gets better with age.
","Blade Runner is a film that eschews cinematic brilliance. It's beautifully gritty, dark, and foreboding in every way in its context and content. It is a sci-fi film, but it is more than that; it is a mere reflection of our modern world where technology has seemingly dominated our lives almost in every aspect. It is also a world where the masses have become more or less human and tend to take for granted just what being human really is. One of the most influential films of all time is finally released as 'The Final Cut' and its great to revisit a classic film that, like a bottle of wine, gets better with age.",10,3,5,31 January 2008
Casino Royale," A darker, grittier, Bond..
","The last time we saw Bond was in the abysmal 'The World Is Not Enough and the campy, CGI-loaded dreck that was 'Die Another Day'. The worst offense to me was being paired up with Denise Richards, who, in laments terms, a horrible actress to boot. As a life long fan caught in a love/hate relationship with Bond, I eagerly awaited this latest film. I felt in my heart that I would be riveted again, but feared I would be disappointed again, given the direction the franchise has taken in recent years. However, I am happy to report that my expectations have been more than met.This is hands down, the BEST Bond film that I have seen in years. Gone is the campy/cartoonish, flamboyant tone from previous films. The plot is more realistic and exciting. I like the fact that the film uses real locations and practical effects (which is a lost art, especially in today's films)rather than CGI, which unfortunately is becoming common place now in action movies (xXx: State of the Union is one example). The action scenes are more brutal and coherent. The technology is great without the silly OTT gadgets, making this film work by today's standards. Bond is more a cold-blooded efficient killer than past Bonds, played exquisitely by Daniel Craig. Craig has certainly cemented the role, even more so than say... Pierce Brosnan. Goldenye and Tomorrow Never Dies were good films, but were cartoony and over the top. I suspect that this is the main reason why Brosnan left the franchise.Martin Campbell has done a great job. He not only gives the film class and gravitas, but a strong foundation, something that the previous films have been severely lacking. He reinvigorates the character in a way that Christopher Nolan has done with the smash-hit Batman Begins. The decision to base the character in reality was certainly a stroke of genius and in the case of Bond, it shows. What's also refreshing is that we finally see Bond face real villains not the comic-book style caricatures that were so prevalent in the series. And the dialog that they deliver is menacing, not campy.Some might say that the plot is a little off in spots, but I say that it is the best in the series as it presents a dark and gritty atmosphere that's believable. Bond is lethal, ruthless, cold and doesn't play second fiddle to the bad guys; a far cry from Brosnan who was a bit of a softie. The only negative I can think of is Eva Green. Her performance wasn't bad, but I think they've could have gotten someone more exotic and sexy and better suited as Bond's love interest.Casino Royal is the best Bond movie of the series and the best movie of the year. Fans of Dr. No and For Your Eyes only will truly appreciate this film. Not only is it the best in the series, but its the most unconventional. And the ending (Craig saying the famous catch-phrase) leaves an open door for a sequel. Go see it!! See it again and be 'Shaken, not Stirred'.",9,1,2,26 November 2006
X2: X-Men United," Delivers everything you wan't in a movie and more.
","With X-Men, Brian Singer introduces us to the mutants with great conviction and admiration in the spirit of the politically and socially complex comic book series; bringing them all to stunning life. In X2, Singer not only expanded upon established material, but improves upon it with some very great ideas. Having seen the first film, I can say with honest sincerity that X2: X-men United outshines the original for many reasons: Case in point: Character development is highly prominent in this second installment with returning and new characters being fleshed out at the same time. There's seems a more open-mindedness to the atmosphere overall of the mutant hysteria with both human and mutant at each other's throats; very relevant to our current post-911 world. And with one of the main characters going out of his way to explain the dilemma of his true nature, that alone rings all the more true.The story is more tighter and focused this time around with a morally ambiguous government agent (played by Brian Cox) who seeks genocidal extinction of all mutant kind, even going so far as to justify the means in order to accomplish such goals. Some may say he's conventional but I tend to digress; especially the twists and turns surrounding his character and the ultimate revelation to one of the main characters which I will not spoil for anyone.And the special effects. Oh my HOW SPECTACULAR they are in the skillful manipulation of pyrotechnics and mega kick-ass action brought ever so eloquently by one of the finest craftsmanship in the business!! Singer doesn't go overboard like most action movies of Hollywood's ilk despite being a Hollywood production, but plays it straight with balance and sheer innovative technical skill required of such direction. When you have a script combined with the right amounts of action, there's a great film for your eyes and brain. And sometimes you get the impression that the powers the mutants display are not just for the action, but also for subtlety.And who can forget Nightcrawler; a charming, charismatic, bad-ass mutant and one of the BEST things EVER to happen to the franchise the first time you see him. He nearly stole the show from Wolverine!!! This gives the film a sense of a 'competitiveness' seldom seen in a superhero flick. But there's also a human side to him that conflicts with his faith and identity; again reinforcing one of the human aspects and themes of the comics and first film.But the main selling point of the movie is heart. The comic book series left no stone unturned when touching on taboo subjects like intolerance, fear, prejudice, loneliness, acceptance, and even to a certain extent, genocide. Although the film is science fiction in nature, there is also a sense of verisimilitude that anchors the film to a fundamental level.My only faults are that Cyclops and Storm seem undeveloped but those are only minor quirks in a 'X-citing' action/sci-fi flick.X2: X-men United delivers in bucket loads of superhero goodness with flair and style and mental stimulation. But what followed later on in '06 is another story.",9,0,0,5 June 2008
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," After the disappointing prequels, Star Wars is back on track.
","I know people hate the prequel films; who doesn't. I for one didn't hold Episode 3 in high regard either, but it was at least watchable, to a certain degree. I guess some are not as jaded and cynical as others, but to each his own. For a while, it seem that old magic of the OT couldn't be recaptured or restored to the rightful vision. It seem that Star Wars was doomed to be something of ridicule, rather than the cultural phenomenon that it once was; starting especially of course, with the first film to the last of the OT. But having said that, after coming from seeing TFA, I'm very pleased to report that the force is strong once again in the new film, Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens!! Gone is the cringe-inducing dialog, gone is the stiff, wooden, mechanical acting of the prequels(though they had their moments, but ultimately,uneven)gone is the overuse of CGI without a purpose or support to the story. What is here is what the OT was all about. Well-written characters, superb and at times humorous dialog, great action scenes, but most importantly, a great plot. Without spoiling it, there are numerous twists and turns and even some Easter eggs thrown in for good measure, that while as to remind longtime fans, but surprisingly, add to the overall narrative and it makes the film equally coherent as well as entertaining; something the prequels never achieved despite the high quality production values in accordance with the visuals.Some old faces show up along with some new ones. Leia and the gang are back. It's a treat to see Han Solo again, now with a cynical and world-weary outlook after the music stopped; figuratively speaking. The lead character, played by John Boyega, is both effectively acted and wholly convincing as a former Stormtrooper who does a complete 180 in his place in the galaxy and for better or worse, it's very fun to watch. Daisy Ridley was good as Rey, but I'd hoped to see a little more of her. But I was fascinated by Kylo Ren. Not only does he look imposing, but also menacing as the new Sith Lord on the block, with shadowy and ominous Supreme Leader Snoke, to back him up in their evil path to universal conquest of the galaxy.Sure some of the dialog is hammy and at times corny, as well as some gaps in logic, but that's what to be expected of Star Wars. Why some hold the OT over this film is beyond me,but I guess some people are not satisfied with what this film has to offer.The only gripe I have is while that some scenes are nice and homage the original trilogy, the film-makers played it a little too safe; not offering more new and unexpected, not being bold enough or try new things. Though this implies that they don't want to repeat the same mistakes as the prequel films, they could've flexed their muscles a little more and go for something more epic and grander than having to rely on homage to what was already established before.So in conclusion, this is a very well-made and solid film and although veterans of the series may not view it in the same light as the OT, Some,like me, takes a fresh approach. The force is strong again with this one. Hopefully the next film will be bolder, darker, and more daring than ever before.",Null,4,19,20 December 2015
RED," MUCH better than Jonah Hex!!!
","Out of all the the well deserved backlash against steaming pile 'Jonah Hex' RED beats it hands down in everything moviegoers look for: Character development, story, plot twists, action, and of course dark, witty humor sprinkled evenly out in all the right places. True, it's not Oscar material but it succeeds in it's goal of being just a good movie; something Jonah Hex failed at immeasurably. While Jonah Hex was filled with camp and disjointed scenes at characterization of it's main players, RED gives it's characters plenty of screen time to give the audience insight into their pasts, feelings, warmth and charm, making them more than 2 dimensional and you really feel for the characters as they set out to save their hides from a secret and deadly conspiracy.I like this movie. A lot. With a witty and funny script and some truly awesome set pieces and plot, RED is one of the best comic book movies to put Jonah Hex and it's ilk to shame.",8,0,1,7 November 2010
Godzilla," Best Godzilla film in years!!!
","Wow, what an incredible movie. Granted, the characters are a bit one-dimensional, but the human drama and sense of peril is much more believable than Roland Emmerich's shlock 1998 remake; which despite having some entertaining moments, never captured the dark tone of the 1954 classic monster flick that introduced to the world one of the most beloved and iconic monsters of all time, the G-Man!!! I came in with low expectations, but when all hell breaks loose and the situation becomes more and more dire, that's when things get REALLY exciting. The fight between Godzilla and the Mutos, is nothing short of exhilarating. I only wish that the fights were longer and more intense and not so much focus on the human characters, but in the case of this film, it's justified in getting the audience to have sympathy for the human protagonists, but me personally, I was more enamored with the G-Man, than the humans; mainly stemming from the fact that I'm a HUGE Godzilla fan, and have been wanting to see a film in his original glory for years. Thankfully, it delivered, and by the box-office business this film is doing, we'll be seeing the G-Man in another massive monster mash in the future.Great film. Best one in the franchise I've seen for a long time.",9,3,7,25 May 2014
Looper," The most original Sci-Fi film I've seen this year.
","While Hollywood has taken a beating in terms of rehashes and remakes; some really good like 'Dredd 3d' and of course the Nolan Batman films as well as several others worth mentioning, they're are of course a few gems that are original in concept and narrative. 'Looper' the latest Sci-Fi film from director Riam Johnson is such a refreshing and original concept that I couldn't help but be immersed in it's well-constructed and thrillingly acted atmosphere.The premise is something I've never seen on paper before and no doubt I was confused as the well-written plot unfolded on screen. Many of the ideas presented in 'Looper' are very unheard of and I for one was caught up in the film while trying to pick up things as it went along. I'm looking forward to a second and third viewing in order to fully understand and appreciate it's complex plot with many twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat.But the best parts of this film is the plot and characters. Oodles of character development, which is very important for a film, is prevalent hear with personal relationships, revelations; everything you want in a film and more. Since this is an action film, the action scenes are well done as well as the special effects, which are thankfully not numerous as seen in other films, but the complement, rather than overwhelm the film which lets the audience concentrate more on the story. Some say that the pacing was a little too slow; I tend to disagree as any film with this richness deserves to be savored at a methodical pace and thankfully 'Looper' gives me that and more. I'd choose this film over Expendables 2 anything as that film is, pardon the pun 'expendable'.Acting wise everyone does a good job with the wonderful material they are given with. With high-calibre actors such as Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis, Emily Blunt and Jeff Daniels, every scene they are in(especially the diner scene) they chew it up with irony and delivery.I had a really good time with 'Looper'. A film that is so original that it's complex and confusing(in a good way)plot definitely demands repeat viewings and rewards you for doing so. Challenging and intriguing, 'Looper' is one of the best Sci-Fi films of the year and also the most well-written and acted. Rian Johnson is one director to watch out for and I can't wait to see what he comes up with next.",9,1,12,30 September 2012
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Greatest of all time.
","Let me start by saying that no other film in the history of cinema has profoundly changed the way we look at movies like Star Wars. Star Wars was the epitome of awesome innovative creation masterpiece film making wearing its most revered qualities oh so proudly on its sleeve. Inspired by adventure serials of years past, what makes it come together is sheer imagination and wonder of wildest dreams; enlightening that adventurous spirit and childhood joy experienced by millions who watched and experienced it for the first time. This film is like having the taste of a restaurant-quality delicious, mouth-watering steak and leaves you coming back for more. Lovable, memorable characters, terrific worlds, classic good vs evil, and marvelous adventure abound in one of the most beloved movies of all time. The first of its kind and one of the best. Nothing beats the original.",9,0,0,17 May 2008
Deadpool," A Marvel film like no other. An astounding achievement in humor and action!!
","They said it couldn't be done. They said 'Deadpool' will never be made and I, as well as others, almost agreed. After his abysmal performance in X-crement Origins: Wimperine, the potential of The Merc With A Mouth, was almost terminated without fanfare. Good ol Wade Wilson just couldn't get a break.Well, after so many trials and tribulations, Deadpool was finally given the green light and lo and behold, he bursts out of the comics and onto the silver screen with spectacular results so vulgar, so violent, so crude, yet so refreshingly simple, that it set the bar for R-rated comic book movies; quite possible for years to come. This film proved that violent superheroes...actually...make that anti-heroes can be immensely profitable; judging be the film's juggernaut box-office success. As an origin story, Deadpool is great, showing us a side to the Merc With A Mouth with a violent, vulgar side to the character, but also surprisingly, with human depth; something Origins failed to achieve. Character development and human pathos combine to make a troubled and flawed jerk with a heart of gold, a very likable and relate-table jerk with a heart of gold.Yes, the action is bloody, yet great with slo-mo effects and yes the humor is vulgar and narcissistic, but it fits the character very well. But most importantly, is the acting and Ryan Reynolds NAILS it perfectly. I can think of no other actor that is much suited for the role and he is simply perfect; with his manic personality and spot on wisecracks. The film simply wouldn't work without a hard R rating. Thankfully, the studio let the filmmakers run wild in high octane adventure and explosive gravitas.Props to all involved in Deadpool. It's smart, stylish, and refreshingly original. I'm glad they had the balls to make a R-rated Marvel comic book movie and they achieved it. One of the best films of the year and I can't wait for the inevitable sequel. A second and third viewing is definitely not out of the question. Great film, great cast, great direction. Simply put. Great R-rated comic book movie!!",10,22,49,14 February 2016
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The best!! Better than ANH and my most favorite.
","A New Hope was great but this one takes the cake and not only do I think this film took the trilogy to the next level, but felt it did and more. For one thing ESB is more exciting and darker than ANH with the best direction, best writing, best special effects, best musical score by the legendary John Williams, best story and best action and I can see why Star Wars fans and the general public agree. And the special edition with the added bells and whistles already gives it a more shiner coat of paint made even more delicious on digital widescreen. A more satisfying film that stands out as the best in terms of plot and character development and a fine example that in some cases a sequel can truly outshine the original.A perfect 10. And my personal favorite.",10,0,1,28 May 2008
Mad Max: Fury Road," The best Mad Max film I've ever seen.
","I'll keep this straight and to the point. For YEARS I've waited for a film that lives up to the originals. Although Beyond Thunderdome was decent in it's own right, the film lost it's dark and gritty edge due to it's PG-13; a bane on dark, gritty post-apocalyptic films. Well, fear not for I am happy to report that Fury Road, is every bit as dark and gritty as it's predecessors. Tom Hardy does another incredible job as the world weary Max, a man with nothing to lose wandering the arid, desolate Australian wasteland, with little pockets of civilization here and there. Well, the term 'civilization' is aptly used loosely here because most of them are anything but 'civilized' as these roving band of savages try to eek out a bleak existence by any means necessary and this is the perfect backdrop for the story. With little twists and turns here and there, along with the impressive visuals and riveting action, Fury Road is a crystal clear reminder that CGI and MTV style action does not and should not take the place of a well-written story. Hopefully, a sequel is made. I'm that pumped for it. Best Mad Max film I've ever seen in years. Mad Max is back and he's better than ever.",9,1,7,24 May 2015
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Entertaining than Revenge of The Fallen.
","Upon entering the theater, I was really hesitant on seeing this film; mainly due to the fact that Revenge of The Fallen received very negative reviews. However, and I'm really shocked to say this, I actually enjoyed Dark of The Moon. Sure it's no masterpiece by any means, but what do you expect from a director whose only talent is making things blow up minus character development, plot, and dialog.Dark Of the Moon really is the best film in the series, surpassing ROTF by many a long shot. It's story is better than the first two films, though that's not saying a lot when Bay for no apparent reason at all, inserts random shots of sexual innuendo that really serves no purpose at all in the film and scenes that are totally unnecessary; particularly the antique car and bathroom scene. But the battle scenes between the robots is really impressive and I'm shocked to admit that I was on the edge of my seat watching it all.But still, some characters are seriously overlooked; especially the villains Megatron, Starscream, and Shockwave. Sentinel Prime, really, was the only one who had the most development out of them all. As better than Revenge of the Fallen may be, Dark of the Moon still suffers from the same problems that 1 and 2 had: No fully fleshed out characters and plot. Dark of The Moon has a plot, but it's really skin deep as far as the twists and turns go and because of the fact alone, the emotional attachment is drained significantly.I will say that Dark of The Moon is better than Revenge of The Fallen, but it's not exactly the game changer of the whole Transformers mythos. And judging by the box-office business it's doing in theaters, it's safe to say that a 4 installment will inevitably be made. Hopefully by then it will have a better director and screenwriter along with better acting and plot.",7,1,4,9 July 2011
Jurassic Park," This film will always have a special place in my heart.
","Every once in a while you browse through your movie library and stumble upon a film that takes you back to your childhood and the awe and wonder you experienced for the first time. Jurassic Park is that movie. Never in history has a film portrayed such magnificent creatures from ages past so convincingly and realistically that made you believe they still existed and it is something to witness on a truly epic grand scale. I was very grateful to have the opportunity to see this film with my eyes wide open; absorbing every breathtaking scene, every sense of excitement and adventure, every sense of fright, and every sense of genuine heartfelt movie-magic warmth. With so many memorable moments, this film, even to this day and age, has still stood the test of time and left a permanent stamp on my memory for many years to come and I will forever cherish it and will always hold a special place in my heart.",10,7,11,22 May 2008
