The Blair Witch Project," Not _THAT_ scary...
","Ok ok. So the plot was original... having the actors do the filming was a neat idea, too. But it wasn't _SCARY_. I mean, I was more on edge during the first half of 'Evil Dead'... And, despite the cool 1st person view, I found myself getting motion sickness more than once.When one of the stone pile burial markers was kicked over, I was freaked. I expected all hell to break loose. It didn't. The whole map fiasco was lame, too. It would have been more scary if the map had just disappeared with no explanation. The slime was sort of chintzy too.Granted, there were some heart pounding parts of the movie, but overall, 'Blair Witch' doesn't live up to the hype.",5,0,2,3 August 1999
Mission: Impossible II," typical John Woo cheese
","yeah, so there are some slick action scenes, but a lot of them are unbeleivable and too fake looking. in addition, the dramatic sequences are uncalled for-- pure Velveeta. Thandie Newton does look hot, which is a plus, but her striking looks can't cover up  what is essentially a disappointing movie. it is somewhat entertaining, but falls far short of the hype. i gave it a generous 6.",6,0,0,24 May 2000
The Matrix," ...the best action flick since 'Terminator 2'...
","Given the opportunity to see this movie 4 days before the official opening, for free no less(!), I immediately took it... after all, for me this has been one of the most anticipated films of the year, second only to the 'Phantom Menace.' Despite what the previews have been showing off for the past few months, I wasn't sure about the plot, or of Keanu, for that matter.Well, all my reservations were for naught, because this likely is the best action flick since 'Terminator 2,' and it is easily as groundbreaking technologically now as T2 was back then. 5 minutes into the movie, I thought I was doomed to an overly complex plot, but all was duly explained, and the pieces fit nicely.Keanu Reeves, along with the rest of the cast were superb, especially Laurence Fishburn, who was better than ever. Another performance in need of mention was that of Hugo Weaving as the ruthless Agent Smith... he was just a kick-ass antagonist.And those action scenes... as I mentioned before, they are as groundbreaking today as the scenes in T2 were 8 years ago. They truly must be seen... a feeble description on my part will gravely under-rate how spectacular they are. An awesome soundtrack by such artists as Massive Attack, Rage Against the Machine, Propellerheads, and more, only adds to the overall package. 'The Matrix' is a phenomenal movie in many aspects, and I'm definitely going to see it again...and I'll be happy to pay for it.",10,0,0,30 March 1999
