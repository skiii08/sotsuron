It," Watchable but not exactly the horror i expected..
",Well..why is this a horror movie again.? Seemed to me comedy scenes are way more than horror ones. At the theater everyone was laughing with lines like ''i saved the birth control pills for your sister'' or referring to his friends mom that kid with the glasses said if she wants a kiss from him too as they left their house.. Really.? This built up to a clownfest pretty fast. I couldn't take seriously any of the horror scenes with all that comedy element. Not sure if they went for some Stranger Things recipe instead of original IT. Really it would be a great remake if they didn't included sooo much jokes.,4,0,3,2 October 2017
Us," Best commedy of 2019
","Never have i seen a horror movie causing so much laughter in the room.Not sure why this isnt considered a commedy.The acting from all characters except the main one was terrible.
The plot has more holes than swish cheese.From my point of view if you are to give an explanation this stupid better not give one at all.Let the audience guess or build one their own.
This movie probably has the most misleading trailer in recent history.
Save yourself the time and dont watch it.",1,7,12,23 March 2019
Oldboy," Interesting concept,but major flaws
","i don't understand all the fuss about this movie..i just watched it because of the high rating..it's a good movie but relax people it has major flaws...what i didn't liked : hypnosis doesn't works that way guys...and the biggest bullshit ever,HOW ON EARTH HE DIDN'T REMEMBERED HIS DAUGHTER OR HIS DAUGHTER REMEMBERED HIM..?? i have returned to my homeland after 17 years and still remembered every person and i left as a 5 year old kid....and also Dae-Su and Woo-jinLee seem to have like 15-20 years age difference how come they were classmates..?? i know prison can make you look older but i don't think that much...last thing,Woo-jin Lee looks like a maximum of 30 year old guy so it took him 15 years of Dae-su prison and i would assume that after the school it took Dae-su about 5 years to make a family...so to sum up Woo-jin must have been like 5-10 years old when he made out with his sister and Dae-su would be a 15-20 years old guy going in primary school....major flaws guys",3,8,18,10 November 2013
Pacific Rim," not a bad movie but it's stupid sometimes
","this movie is not bad,actually in is quite pleasant to watch..what bothered me is that it is unreasonable in many cases..so this is a movie about aliens coming to earth but not from outer space but the ocean...a crack in the ocean that they can't close(at first) anyway..the aliens are huge dinosaur like creatures(but bigger) that attack using their body only(smashing,biting etc)...until there everything was perfect..the stupid part now..humans could not beat them with the primary weapons so they decided to build huge robots to fight them...the weird thing is that these robots rarely beat an alien by force,they use cannons and nuclear missiles...so,why bothering building something like that when you already can lunch missiles from a submarine or tanker or artillery etc...in the movie they spend billions gathered from every country in the world to build robots that are destroyed almost every battle..why didn't they send their missiles from an aircraft.???...this movie makes no sense at all in this case....second stupid thing,the robots cannot be controlled by one human cause their brains are connected to the machine and can't handle the pressure resulting to death,so 2 people must be used..these two people must have a strong bond because they are connected via their memories and thinking with each other and the machine..stupid as hell and wait to see how they move the robots...last thing the robots....they look like a fusion between Power Rangers robot and Iron man and don't have any use except the missiles they can lunch,yeah they can hit with punches and stuff but the aliens never die cause of that...anyway if you don't feel offended by the logic of this movie you'll be able to enjoy it..this movie reminds me of an amazing movie with a single huge green dinosaur like creature attacking New York which it's name starts with a G..unfortunately i can't say the name but i hope you got it...",4,2,5,24 October 2013
Watchmen," A masterpiece of a movie.Highly underrated
","I cannot begin to express my thoughts about this movie. First of all i must say that i am a big comic books fan and i like most of superhero movies from either universe. So let's just say a few words about watchmen. I'll start with the cast.Jackey's(Rorschach) narration is top notch.He also did an amazing job bringing the character to life.Every other actor did equally amazing,i just mentioned Jackey since he is more like a main character. The movie is quite long but it is necessary to explain the plot.The movie unfolds like a charm. i wont spoil anything from the plot.it would be a crime.Just trust when i say it's got one of the brightest plot twists i've seen in any movies not just superhero-comic book ones. i will say nothing more.Just watch it. i feel so bad that i missed it when it was in the cinema.It's such a shame this diamond of a movie didn;t sell well.",10,1,3,28 March 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Entertaining but not the movie i was hopping for
","As many other i my self from the moment bvss was announced i knew i'd by a ticket to see it.And still i don't regret it.But the movie wasn't that good.I will start by Afflecks selection as the new batman.Although he gave a solid performance i still think he is not suitable for the role.He has that sweet guy face.No way im believing he had a dark background or a dark side of himself.Bale had excellent previous experience in lunatic characters and seems way more badass. Since i started with batman i will also mention Alfred.I think Michael Caine was way better Alfred and really showed a connection with Bale something that the Irons/Affleck duo lacks a lot.It was like these two just met in the movie.On the other side everything from Superman aspect was quite good except Luthor.Eisengerg over reactions where kinda fake and he really doesn't have the presentation to fill Luthors character shoes.Too young maybe in the future he gets better. I really liked Gals performance as Wonder Woman so nothing to complain about there.As for the movie it self...Kinda stupid..the first half was boring with the same scenes we've seen many times over the years(batman as a kid falling in a cave with bats,his parents dying etc).Batman within minutes decided to go on a war.Superman gave a lame figh that didn;t even to go hand to hand,he could just kill him with his laser beams for example..Anyway i must add here that batman is still human,no amount of armor can protect you from a hit that will send you flying across buildings.The shock from the impact of the first hit by Superman as we saw in the movie should have shattered every single bone of his body.To conclude the really bad fight batman makes an even faster decision than the one making a war with Superman,he decides to help him because their mothers shared the same name...really.?As for Darkside....it needed like 30 seconds to be created with very brief explanation of how it happened.it made it look so easy that humans could make a 100 of them.",3,2,7,1 April 2016
