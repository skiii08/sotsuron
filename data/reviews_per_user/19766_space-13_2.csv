Requiem for a Dream," The director works the audience as if he himself is a drug dealer supplying what they crave.
","It's surprising to see how many people are being duped by the director of this pretentiously and gratuitously violent film.  What the director offers are quick fixes of rapid fire imagery and viciously cut scenes without any need or opportunity for the audience to think hard or deeply about anything. Take,for example, his treatment of the character played by Jennifer Connelly. How is his degradation of that character any different than her debasement by the other men who exploit her for their cruel pleasure? The director consistently keeps his view of her 'objective' in the literal sense of presenting her as an object -- upon which he projects his own fantasies of how an addicted woman would sell herself. Why doesn't he allow her to have any inner, believable life that could make her more real and make her conflicts more intense? (His objectification of her is so extensive that it feels at the end as if he is one of the men zeroing in on her pain to feed their horrifying pleasure.) Ellen B's character is more fully drawn, but even then, why does the director need multiple shots of electric shock treatment when one shot would show what she is feeling? The answer is that the director knows the fix his audience is seeking.  We say we're appalled, but we can't stop watching what the slick photography and postmodern soundtrack turn into the very kind of media-induced high that his movie supposedly is critiquing. Wake up, audiences, and try to think for yourselves. The best directors want us to do that; the worst are afraid of what will happen if we dare to do so.",6,1,2,30 June 2002
Black Hawk Down," No point, no moral center, nothing to make this worth watching
","Why do we need an action film about the US fighting in Somalia? What do any of us gain from propaganda? If every US soldier fights not for a cause but to stand by his buddies -- as nearly every scene and certainly the ending insist -- then what difference does it make if he's killing people in Somalia, Vietnam, Europe, or anywhere else? The portrayal of 'the skinnies' by Ridley Scott is despicable. Very few even have faces; instead they have screaming mouths and war cries to reinforce their inhumanity in the viewers' eyes. Of course, we don't want to think about'the skinnies'too much; after all, that could slow down the action -- and the action has to be the whole point. (Don't ask, though, why  Scott has time to make us hear about Ewan's coffee preferences.) The Somalians aren't real, and neither are the US soldiers. Scott manipulates all the characters to skew the telling of history as he wants us to see it. Scott isn't just 'on the side of the soldiers'; he's expecting his audience to give up their any critical inquiry into the nature of war and the immense power held by our military leaders. Not one soldier in this movie is enraged at the political decisions that have led to so many lives needlessly lost. Is Scott saying soldiers don't think - they just obey? And is he saying we should admire soldiers for that? If so, he's participating in the kind of film making that many of our country's enemies have been perfecting for years.",1,13,25,17 June 2002
