Vertigo," Hitchcock's Magnum Opus; A masterpiece on pathological obsession
","With an incredibly storied career, director Alfred Hitchcock has created many outstanding motion pictures, and while Psycho (1960) is undoubtedly his most iconic and influential, he never quite reached the level of sophistication, narrative prowess & depth that he reached in Vertigo, which is arguably the master's greatest film.It did require a second viewing for me personally to appreciate Vertigo for the work of art that is truly is, and even though it is a bit of a cliché these days, Vertigo is the kind of motion picture that definitely needs to be seen multiple times in order to be judged properly. This is the case because the initial first time viewer will most likely focus on the primary narrative, which consists 'Scottie' Ferguson helping his army buddy Gavin Elster investigate the strange behavior of his wife. This entire narrative already seems to wrap up completely after a little over half of the movie's entire runtime, which will probably leave the initial viewer with feelings of confusion & unsatisfaction. However, one of the greatest aspects of Vertigo is that it has this classic Hitchcock mystery/twisted atmosphere, but also an incredibly deep surreal layer added on top of it, which was quite unique for Hitchcock. Thus, the
'usual' Hitchcock narrative wraps up after a little over an hour, paving the way for the much more personal, surreal and obsession based final hour. When you understand what is going to happen in a second viewing, you could become more focused on Scottie's inner confliction and the way he handles his obsession, making the viewer finally realize the emotional resonance and artistic prowess of the final hour.From one of the greatest opening title sequences to its end, Vertigo is Hitchcock at the absolute top of his game. The title sequence, starting with a shot of the mouth of a woman while moving to her eye, followed by an inside glance of her eye coupled with spiralling imagery, is pretty much an identical piece of storytelling as the coming two hours. In a way, the audience is shown Scottie's future obsession from the viewpoint of the camera itself, making us feel obsessed. From a shot of the mouth of the woman towards the eyes, there are a lot of digital spiralling special effects signifying the loss of self control, making this superb title sequence indeed very reminiscent of what is going to happen afterwards, making it also one of the most creative opening titles ever made.James Stewart is near flawless as the conflicted John 'Scottie' Ferguson, displaying his wide range of acting talents as a morally complex character. Kim Novak's divine beauty as Madeleine speaks for itself, and her characteristic stiffness perfectly emphasizes her character's precarious situation as she is torn between her own identity and the man she loves. The screenplay is also superb, as is the absolutely gorgeous cinematography and production design, which are used as a medium of subtle sub text and subliminal messages.I don't think there's any doubt that Vertigo is Hitchcock's most complex & nuanced film, as Vertigo contains many layers of narrative, character & themes. There are not many themes that do not apply to Vertigo, but the most common one is obviously obsession. Ferguson starts out as an individual that is suffering from Acrophobia, which causes Vertigo (Dizziness), after a tragic encounter on a rooftop where an officer died trying to save his life. Guilt stricken by this event, he quits the police force. This sense of guilt precisely seems to be what causes Scottie to want to escape from reality, and see Madeleine as his dream woman, something so surreal and dream-like without him even realizing it. Later it is of course revealed that she was in fact never real, further escalating his descent into madness, and feeding his pathological hunger for her. After Madeleine seemingly jumps off a clock tower, falling to her death, Scottie, a year later, is still haunted by his past memories of her, and sees a mirage of her appear in every one of these places. After later spotting a lookalike ( She was in fact the same woman as Madeleine ) Judy, Scottie becomes obsessed with turning her into his image of Madeleine, the fake image of the woman in question. This is of course a superb bit of character development, and Scottie goes through many different personality phases during the course of the film, being the seemingly average joe near the start, to trying to become the hero he is not, to falling into madness and becoming consumed by obsession near its end.As for the story itself, which concludes in Gavin Elster throwing his wife out the clocktower ( Scottie in fact never met Madeleine, only Judy ), it is a brilliantly written mystery filled with an unpredictable twist in that everything was a farce made up by Gavin to think his wife committed suicide, which of course all sounds very Hitchcockian. But again, Vertigo's true strength does not solely come from this, but with the way Hitchcock develops these characters, uses the color palette, blocking & camera movements to tell a visual story. The symbolism of color and movement in Vertigo is endless, but a primary example of this is the desaturation of the color red in the background when Scottie first sees Madeline, which emphasizes his future love & longing for her, and of course the color red is generally associated with those particular emotions. Another great example is when Judy finally 'turns back' into Madeleine, covered by a ghostly green tint, to signify that it is indeed a dead woman's image that he loves. These are just one of the many examples where Hitchcock uses color to invoke emotions in the audience.Of course one cannot forget the incredible contibution of composer Bernard Herrmann to this picture. Quite possibly his greatest score, his works for Vertigo ( Heavily influenced by Richard Wagner's Tristan und Isolde Prelude ) are a work of art in itself, perfectly encapsulating the tone of the movie, as Tristan & Isolde is also about doomed love, just like the film. When Herrmann's score hits its climax ( Judy turning into Madeleine ), the most personally significant event in the story happens, meaning the placement of the various themes is also fantastic.Vertigo has a superb mystery narrative for the first hour, and an incredible characterization piece during the second hour. All the while it is brilliantly acted, written, photographed, but above all expertly directed by Hitchcock himself, making it indeed a remarkable achievement and a superb piece of art.",9,5,8,10 February 2019
Come and See," A haunting, disturbing and terrifying study on the inhumanity and senselessness of war
","If there were ever a film that could be called the ultimate anti-war film which shows the horrors of war and the dehumanization of its main characters in such a disturbing way that it will leave an absolutely depressing impact on you it is definitely Elem Klimov's Come and See. Most of the time we see this film from Florya's point of view ( A teenage boy ) to show us truly how the war impacts those that were full of innocence before it started. The first half hour or more of the film consists of setting up his character, his connection with his family and with the young woman Glasha later on. It is a bit of the odd man out in the film as while still being depicted as grim it is not a very disturbing or depressing start. However, when the first bombs fall, you are immediately into this highly powerful and immersive masterpiece, because of things such as letting us hear the temporary deafening situation of our main character by letting us hear it with the audio, and deafening out all other sounds so we truly also begin to feel it as if it were happening to the audience. Also noticeable is the frequent use of extended trackingshots shot with a steadicam which are ofcourse always a great addition to improve immersion because in a long continuous take we can see everything our characters are doing, and are not subjected to constant different angles which always take a couple of seconds ( or less, but still, it takes time ) to keep that immersion.The acting is of top notch quality the entire movie, and especially the teenage main character Florya played by Aleksey Kravchenko is exceptional with his desperate facial expressions and his increasing dehumanization throughout the film. The violence is so powerful in this film because anything bad could happen to our main character at any time and primarily because Klimov allows us to see the incredibly disturbing facial expressions of Florya in silence after such an event numerous times, so we can truly reflect on how terrible these events were, and to show how further down the path to madness he was getting. The soundtrack is haunting and eerie ever since the first bombs fall in the film, and all this makes gives it a kind of horror esque feeling which doesn't happen all that often in war films. Platoon is often called a great anti-war statement, but Platoon has lighthearted scenes with some witty dialogue, whereas when the violence starts in Come and See, it is basically one ride akin to peering into the depths of hell itself.I would say the later chapter of the film is a bit too focused on trying too hard to let us hate the Germans while creating a bit of a lack of characterization, yet the entire village burning scene is so emotionally draining to the extreme, edited so well and filmed with such grace that this doesn't truly matter to the overall quality of the film. The visuals also speak for themselves, with one hellish picture after another when the violence starts bursting out, and this is enhanced by the incredible use of sound and sound editing to create a narrative in itself. However, this doesn't mean that the film doesn't have a narrative, as this is established so well in the first half hour or forty five minutes of the film.This all sums up Come and See as one of the most powerful of all war films, due to its ability to show violence as such an inhumane action due to its incredible visuals, sound, facial expressions & acting. It is highly disturbing and it is not for the faint hearted, as its depressing nature and soundtrack and realistic portrayal of the brutality of war result in a terrifying experience, yet it is also one of the few war films that is able to truly move you with its honesty and brutality.",9,2,3,28 May 2018
Scarface," Superb morality play about the corruptive nature of greed & power
","Undoubtedly one of the all time greats in its depiction of the rise and fall of a certain character and/or their empire, Scarface is a fascinating moral drama which slowly descends further into madness and greediness.The character of Tony Montana, who is ofcourse brilliantly portrayed by Al Pacino, is one of the most fascinating and morally complex anti hero protagonist's in cinema. Mind you, he is generally never shown as being any more than a greed ridden psychopath with little consideration of human life, but Tony's backstory about him fleeing communist Cuba and his subsequent hatred for this ideology does give him tons of depth as to why he is the person that he is today. Even though he is quite unlikeable from the start, his descent into madness combined with his rise to power does truly slowly show the audience what the corruption of a position of power does to a human being, in a way that is quite similar to the excellent portrayal of Daniel Day Lewis as Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood (2007). Both characters are selfish, arrogant and slightly psychopathic from the start, but their descent into madness is still a really fascinating piece of character development., as Tony is gradually shown succumbing to his own greed.As possibly the ultimate Al Pacino performance, it is no secret that his acting is absolutely brilliant as Tony Montana. Anger, hatred, and even a bit of disconnection and sadness ( In scenes with his mother for example, who shuns him for the life he leads ) are all emotions that Al Pacino captures perfectly in his role. This versatile and emotional performance really shows the wide range of his acting capabilities after the quite monotonous and calculated character of Michael Corleone that he portrays in The Godfather. Other excellent performances are provided by the likes of Robert Loggia, F. Murray Abraham & Michelle Pfeiffer as the stand-outs of this superb cast.The set design truly immerses the audience into breathing the Miami air by its atmospheric replication of it, as most of the film was filmed in Los Angeles due to a lot of Cubans in Miami presumably protesting against the subject of this film. Particularly the color palette is outstanding, and provides many beautiful images during the nearly three hour running time. There is a lot of variation in color, as one might expect from a film that portrays something as lively as Miami. It does however not serve to be there to brighten up the day, as the film itself is quite hopeless, dark & in a way, even quite sad. Brian de Palma uses a lot of variation in his scenes, with many shots panning right, left, up or down, and sometimes varying between them during the same shot. This makes every scene and every encounter look fresh, interesting and dynamic. Oliver Stone's screenplay also results in quite a fascinating coherent narrative that slowly but surely brings Tony closer to his inevitable fall, which ironically is caused by one of the very few 'morally good' actions that Tony performs ( Saving the family, which causes Sosa to send assassins after him ). This is also a nice avoidance of typical Hollywood cliché's, because it shows us that performing the morally right deed will not always end in joy.The original score by Giorgio Moroder is fantastic, with a simple synthesizer melody that perfectly captures the duality of Tony's situation, as there is a sense of superiority in it which symbolizes Tony being on top of the world, but there is also a sense of eeriness in it which symbolizes the impending doom and death that is coming for him. The final scene in particular is also a fantastic visual example of this, as Tony falls into the pool with the statue behind him stating 'The world is yours', which is ofcourse a superb bit of irony of his gradual corruption to get to the top.There are some slighly absurd sequences, such as the scenes in which Gina ( Tony's sister ) is with some guy and Tony's compulsive protection disorder takes over, which shows us a close up of Tony's eyes while some triggering music plays. It seems kind of forced and lacks a bit of subtlety, which is something that is handled very well in the rest of the film. It is also quite obvious that Tony takes a bit too many bullets in the final sequence to still be standing, but this can be categorized as 'Suspension of disbelief'. Still, the final shootout is in a way quite reminiscent to Taxi Driver's, except that in Scarface the attempted scale of the fight results in quite an absurd and ridiculous firefight, with Tony gunning down about 20 professional hitman while being shot about 30 times. However, the gunfight itself is technically executed very well. The rich set design of the mansion as the beautiful shootout location, the fantastic editing, and the competent direction really does create a superb action sequence.Scarface is a fantastic and atmospheric study on greed, and is indeed much deeper than the 'Shoot 'em up gangster flick' it is for some reason many times labelled as.",8,0,1,11 November 2018
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," It seems as though nobody involved in this franchise has the capability to learn from their mistakes
","I think that everybody will agree with me here when i say that the Bella & Edward romance in Twilight is one of the worst, wooden & totally unconvincing romances ever filmed in the history of world cinema. But unfortunately not the writers or the director seems to understand this and thus what we have here is a film that probably uses up about 60% of its time with a ridiculous and often times unintentionally hilarious romance.Eclipse was still pretty bad, but it was a step in the right direction for the franchise, as the focus seemed to be a bit more off of their worthless romance story and more on the actually interesting story about the newborns. Unfortunately, Breaking Dawn basically manages to fall into the same depths the first two fell in. We have a long drawn out half hour long wedding scene as if they thought they could pull off a 'The Godfather' or a 'The Deer Hunter' scene ( I apologise for naming these two actually GOOD movies in the same sentence as Twilight ). At the start you can see Kristen Stewart actively trying to pull off a happy face and you can frequently see her smiling ( Don't worry, her sighing, head shaking and eye contact evasing is still there ) which was already an extreme surprise to me, even though it was mostly just her lips moving and not much else. However, this was only limited to the start since after that her infamous legendary wooden facial expressions return. Ofcourse it doesn't help during the wedding scene that none of the characters there, or in the whole universe of Twilight for that matter are even slightly interesting.The honeymoon sequence consists of wholly Bella & Edward romance scenes and these 20-30 minutes have to be some of the worst ever filmed. We know their romance is terrible, unconvincing and ridiculous due to the fact that both of them are unable to act and unable to express sincere human emotions ( Especially Bella obviously ). Bella can be heard saying, and i quote: 'Why can't you see how perfectly happy i am???' Gee, Bella, i wonder why, could it be because you are just totally unable of conveying emotions in every way when you come onto the screen? The cinematography in these scenes was alright though, i'll give it that, but if you cannot combine cinematography with a story or great characters you might as well be watching an environmental documentary instead of a film.The final hour of the film might have been interesting, if we as the audience were actually given a single reason to care about what happens to any of the characters in this film. And why oh why would Jacob and Edward seriously fight over a wooden plank who is unable to comfortly gesture even the simplest human emotions. We are never given a single reason as to why the men in this film are attracted to Bella, other than dumb statements such as Edward saying during the wedding that she is 'someone you can bare your soul to, and who accepts you as you are', yeah right. Name me one person who couldn't come up with this blatantly obvious cliché nonsensical reason and color me surprised. I should also mention that there is a scene in which a bunch of CGI wolves start talking amongst themselves, since that scene is so ridiculous it deserves a little rant of its own. At first i thought the Quilletes could only talk in human form, but it seems as though i was wrong, and what a mistake this turned out to be. Their mouths don't move, so where is the sound even coming from? It is even supposed to be an important scene about standing up for yourself, but it is disguised in so much ridiculous CGI that it is actually just comic gold. I have no qualms with certain things being CGI ( Even though the CGI wolves were terrible ), but such a ridiculous attempt of conveying emotion in a scene cannot be told in such a complete CGI fest where not even one actual human being is visible.It seems as though the writers and the director didn't learn from their mistakes, and kept the focus on Bella & Edward's terrible romance for far too long. The second half of the film might be slightly more interesting, but it is still as terrible cinema can get. It does have some certain good musical scores and cinematography, but in context of this film this cannot possibly even slightly save the failure it has become.",1,0,0,20 June 2018
Citizen Kane," Elevated, by reputation, to heights it never reaches, but nonetheless an excellent picture
","Despite what so called ''experts'' or critics might tell you, Citizen Kane is not really the greatest movie of all time, as it is many times referred as. It is not the flawless picture that so many people say it is. And it is quite obvious that people who disagree there are of the mind that somehow external over the years evolving influence negates everything (That is somewhat flawed) in the film itself.Citizen Kane is definitely not the average 40s picture. It starts off without any opening credits, something quite unheard of in movies of that time, and instead just shows the movie's title in illuminating letters, after which one of course gets the iconic opening panning shot towards Xanadu. Despite all its merits, there are obvious flaws notable in the movie, namely during the first half, and especially during the expository introduction sequence of Kane's character. This slideshow with a horribly wooden voice telling us of Kane's past life is like a spoon with irrelevant information maliciously and tediously being put into the audience's mouth. Not to mention the fact that nobody could have actually heard Kane say ''Rosebud'' as there was nobody in the room when he said it.Furthermore, modern day scenes in which a more or less faceless reporter tries to uncover the meaning behind those words, which were Kane's dying words, are simply devoid of all interest. Director Orson Welles decided to film the shots of the reporter mostly in the shade, and their faces are rarely visible, and when the reporter is speaking to a person of Kane's past, the camera is only fixed on the latter. Admittedly, this is not such a significant flaw, as Citizen Kane's real strengths come from the flashbacks, told quite brilliantly in non linear fashion (Though at some points a character has one of these memories that those characters couldn't possibly have, due to them not being there, but that's kind of a nitpicking flaw). Welles wants to somewhat dehumanize the reporting angle by the obvious lack of lighting, and seems to want to focus solely on Kane.Of course, technically speaking, Citizen Kane is a piece of brilliance. It utilizes incredibly lighting in particular, and has a sort of direction that was also quite unheard of during this time (The close up of Kane's mother standing at the window and panning backwards to change to a mid-shot in a single frame, for example). It is easy to spot the influence of a lot of later works in these kind of techniques, evident also in camera positioning & blocking (The many shots of a character in the foreground, middle & background, creating the most dynamic of pictures & frames, adapted famously later on by Kurosawa as a trademark ). And there is thus little doubt of Citizen Kane's status as a piece of technical brilliance.The acting by Orson Welles is superb, and he pretty much outshines all opposition with ease in this picture. Of course, it also helps that Kane is the only real in-depth character of the bunch, as every other character is only there to enhance Kane's state of mind. It is fascinating to watch this flawed person descend into despair due to his inability to love anything other than himself, and his character arc is indeed quite superb, as is the aging process (Keep in mind, Welles who plays Kane was only 26 in this picture) that occurs during the many years that pass by. One could say it is a slight flaw that none of the other characters really have their own goals or their own inner conflicts like Kane, but as they contribute significantly to Kane's character arc, this in comparison seems like a minor issue.The non linear storytelling, as stated before, is superbly written in, although the things only really get under way when Welles is onscreen. It is structured like the perfect mystery in this sense, as the audience slowly get to the truth behind the final utterances of Kane, that truth which will hold the key to the cause of the conflict within Kane.Though it makes use of a horribly obligatory wooden newsreel exposition opening, and though it is not without its logical flaws, Welles chews up the scenery, and the technicalities speak for themselves. It is not as great as it is many times hailed as, this status being purely the result of its everlasting influence, but it is still as a stand alone film a superb picture, a picture of man at his most imperfect form, destroying one's self from within.",8,0,0,15 February 2020
12 Angry Men," A riveting, tension filled 'thriller' in the confines of one single room
","As a directional debut, you could do worse than Sidney Lumet's excellent '12 Angry Men'. It would be the beginning of an illustrious career, even though perhaps the heights of his debut would never quite be reached again.12 Angry Men is, apart from several opening shots, closing shots and a couple of scenes in a side room, filmed completely in one single room. To create a fascinating, character driven & tension filled picture can be quite difficult for some directors with this knowledge, but Lumet's direction here is world class. He uses the single location to enhance the feeling of claustrophobia, which also enhances a feeling of tension as all characters grow angrier as the film progresses. Much has been said about Lumet's use of camera angles to enhance the mood in our characters, such as the fact that the camera is generally placed at higher angles during the first act of the film, and gradually seems to be placed lower and lower towards the end, as more people are convinced of the 'not guilty' vote, so the camera emphasizes their superiority over the 'guilty' voters. Even though the film is largely in a single room, Lumet also uses weather conditions as a mood setter, with the setting being in a heatwave of some kind, and when the tables start turning towards the end in terms of the votes, the weather switches to pouring rain, which is generally an even larger symbolism of 'chaos', and that is precisely what is going on during the final moments of this picture.12 Angry Men is also undoubtedly one of the best acted films in cinematic history, with in particular Lee J. Cobb giving the performance of a lifetime. This is not just an angry character, thriving on nihilistic thoughts and hating on everything that happens, but a tragic character that is prejudiced due to his strained relationship with his own son. This brings forth another point, which are ofcourse all twelve characters. All of these characters have some kind of background, origin, and all of them behave very differently and according to their personal lives and experiences. An opening shot of the room featuring all of the jurors entering and bantering with eachother already gives the audience an idea as to what kind of people these jurors are. All the while Lumet uses very long takes, switching between mid-shots & wide-shots in single takes to create the most immersive and personal experience possible. Later in the film, when things start to heat up even more, he also induces a fantastic use of the close-up, which is ofcourse generally the most personal and direct of shot compositions.Furthermore, the screenplay by Reginald Rose is also a phenomenal addition to this film, as every single line of dialogue, character building and general confrontations enhance the tension significantly. Ofcourse, we do not get to witness extraordinary production design or scale due to the simplistic setting, but it is hard to imagine what Lumet could have done even better considering the material he was given.Due to Lumet's technical expertise, visual mood setters, claustrophic atmosphere & the fantastic energetic acting, it feels as a 'thriller' in a drama setting. Ofcourse the fact that the audience does not know anything about the case beforehand also helps, since the viewer will be even more compelled to follow the discussions used in this picture, because we do not know anything about the case yet. In the end, whether or not the kid is guilty is shown to be quite irrelevant, as this film is mainly a message about the interference of personal prejudice in terms of law. Every character, however, is displayed as having some kind of humane reason as to why they think a certain way. Even Juror #3, who, as stated before, relates the kid in question to his own relationship with his son.As one of the best-acted films of all time, combined with a fantastic screenplay, impeccable direction, in depth character development and characterization, 12 Angry Men is no doubt one of the greatest directional debuts ever made.",9,0,0,9 December 2018
The Hustler," Newman and Scott are phenomenal
","The Hustler is such a solid movie that in which i have trouble seeing any weakness in conventional cinema rating aspects ( Acting, screenplay, cinematography, music etc ) resulting in a near flawless film that is further enhanced by its amazing casting.What could have been a movie about merely playing pool has turned into a study on 'character' and capitalism. 'Fast' Eddie Felson ( Paul Newman ) seems to hopelessly want to be the best, and doesn't know when to quit even when ahead a significant amount, because he needs to have the satisfaction in his mind of beating Minnesota Fats ( Jackie Gleason ) until he quits. Charlie ( Myron McCormick ), his partner, symbolizes the sane and logical part of Eddie, that one should quit when ahead, and not continue to lose it all again. When Eddie eventually dismisses Charlie, his last hold on controlling his self destructive nature disappears, and it is only later when met with Bert Gordon ( George C. Scott ) that this 'hold' returns to Eddie. It is a great character study on how Eddie, the arrogant talented 'born loser' turns into the epitome of a 'winner' through a long series of relatable and emotional events that occur. Newman is simply incredible as usual, and he seems to understand his character like no other. His entire monologue about being called a born loser with Sarah, his fantastic facial acting, his desperate drunken mannerisms, it all sums up in that he IS basically Eddie Felson. Jackie Gleason is great as Minnesota Fats, and Piper Laurie as Sarah Packard. But apart from Newman the other true star has to be George C. Scott, whose character symbolizes greed as the true capitalist that seeks only money and doesn't seem to care about anything at all along the way. ( As Eddie says to him, 'You're dead inside' ) Scott's energetic acting, head up tilting mannerisms to show how much above everyone else he feels he is, fast manner of speaking and this arrogant kind of self control result in a phenomenal performance and everytime these actors come on the screen it results in fantastic scenes.The acting is further enhanced by a fantastic screenplay so the dialogue said by these great actors never go to waste. As stated before the dialogue between Eddie & Sarah is so key to understanding his character perfectly for the audience, and it delivered in such an absorbing way by Newman. The dialogue in the final scene, and generally any scene in which Newman and Scott speak to eachother. The cinematography is world class and captures the 60s feel of the film like no other, which is also due to the fantastic Jazz score by Kenyon Hopkins. The pool games themselves are set up great with a lot of innovative shots of the audience's reactions pictured over the pool shots themselves, and a lot of the shots were apparantly made by Gleason and Newman themselves, with the occasional intervention of Willie Mosconi ( Reportedly one of the greatest pool players of all time ). It all results in a masterpiece of character development, that seems to be near flawless and covers all the angles of the aspects that make a movie great.",9,0,0,7 June 2018
Gettysburg," A fantastic tribute to honor and courage in the hearts of men
","As still the longest American film production ever made to this day, Gettysburg had a lot to live up to, one of them being to create a fascinating experience for this entire duration, but it has succeeded valiantly in this.Gettysburg is not your typical war picture full of vivid characterization, twists, or melodrama ( With the exception of a few scenes ). Instead, it chooses to film the strategies of the three day battle, and the battle sequences themselves, in a way that is most historically accurate. While a high amount of detail and fondness to historical accuracy can damage a film's core, ( Seeing as historical accuracy is always an attribute, and not a virtue, in film ) Gettysburg still manages to capture somewhat of a narrative and a general humanitary theme that makes one care about it. Thus, it succeeds not just as a historical piece, but as a seperate piece of art about bravery, honor & courage in the face of adversity, with a valiant sense of patriotism that is so rare to find.With on-location shooting in Gettysburg, a certain air of authenticity is also given to this picture, and the stunning use of seemingly endless waves of extra's during battle sequences is nothing short of astonishing. These battle sequences themselves are incredibly edited, with a superb overview of the situation the battle is in at a particular point. While there are some close ups of established characters, it generally uses the great action/consequence technique, with people firing their guns, after which in the next cut an opponent hits the ground. This way there is truly an emotional connection to what is happening on screen, instead of if we only got to watch a fixed camera on an invincible protagonist.Gettysburg also features phenomenal acting, particularly Martin Sheen's depiction of Robert E. Lee, Sam Elliot & Richard Jordan. However, Performances such as Jeff Daniels as Colonel Chamberlain, and Tom Berenger as General Longstreet are also worthy of notice. In the end, there isn't a weak link in the acting performances in the entire picture. The accents are authentic and spot on, the emotional range ( Especially of Richard Jordan ) is superb, and the mannerisms are also fitting. It is not as if we were watching actors, but the real thing.Randy Edelman's original score is also nothing short of spectacular, perfectly capturing that feeling of courage that the film means to convey. During Pickett's Charge, this gigantic heroic orchestral piece is constantly covering their walk, and while it has been criticized as 'Glorifying violence' for this, one has to remember that this is a story about the courage of the human heart, and the epic musical score enhances this courage during Pickett's Charge, and not because of the fact that it is glorifying this war.Furthermore, the film does a tremendous job of not depicting either side as villains. There are no villains in this story. There is a large amount of respect from either side to one another, despite their differences in vision. The visual scale of the film is also beyond compare, with four hours and thirty minutes of superb visual filmmaking, and as stated before the fantastic use of loads of extra's without the use of CGI. The days when battle sequences were filmed with this sense of authentic scale now seems long behind us.Now, what truly gives Gettysburg that humanist edge that makes one care about it, despite its technical brilliance in the battle sequences? There are numerous moments of characters expressing their regrets, or their views on the war, and particularly those of General Amistad ( Richard Jordan ) can be seen as heartbreaking. These characters are given human form due to these small little talks around the campfire. Chamberlain's opening speech is also an example of this. Admittedly, it has some restrictions because of the historical accuracy, but there is still a sense of true humanity in these characters, making one care about them.Gettsyburg features great acting, a fantastic original score, technically and emotionally brilliant battle sequences, and while lying an emphasis on the tactical nature of the battle instead of extended characterization, there is still a large degree of true emotional power in this picture, as one of the greatest examples of a film that combines historical accuracy and raw cinematic power in a splendid fashion.",9,2,2,3 January 2019
Lost in Translation," A constant stream of awkward moments
","In a motion picture like Lost in Translation, the bonding and relatability of the characters have an even more important emphasis than they usually do. Unfortunately the relatability is something that is completely devoid in Lost in Translation.The acting in the entire picture is mediocre, and this is combined with an average screenplay that consists of mostly 'Hey dude' or 'You know' juvenile kind of dialogue. This is excluding Bill Murray as Bob Harris, who was pretty much the only actor in the film able to perform on a decent level, as he captured the emptiness of his character perfectly due to many of his fantastic cynical takes on his commercial scenes. The cinematography has some great shots, such as the golf course which shows the audience a great level of depth & a couple of outside the car window shots which show our protagonist's face with the mirror image of urban Japan reflected in it. However, there are also multiple weird behind the shoulder low camera angles which make it seem like more of a documentary instead of a motion picture, & Sofia Copolla doesn't seem very fluent in the technicality of the camera movements, as many of the camera movements are jumping all over the place. Copolla also shows us a lot of shots in public occasions while focusing on people nobody knows and nobody cares about while music is playing. While this is presumably done to show us that Murray & Scarlett Johansson's character Charlotte do not belong in this world, the immersion into their characters is severely decreased since because of this since the focus is seldom actually on both of them alone.Lost in Translation's strength is from its silent parts, the slow walks around the city or Charlotte's walk around the temple. As soon as people open their mouths ( Except for Murray ) the quality significantly decreases. Giovanni Ribisi and Anna Faris in particular are extremely cringeworthy in their acting, and their line delivery will embarrass you all the way through. Scarlett Johansson seems to be on the level of Kristen Stewart in showing emotional range because her facial expression never seems to really change during the course of the film. Her weird quirky kind of slightly smiling facial expression is all we see the entire film. She frequently uses 'uuuhmmm' to open a sentence & seems extremely insecure about her qualities on screen. A bond with Johansson's character can therefore never really be formed, since she cannot show any kind of human emotion that will make me really believe that she is in the situation that her character is in. ( There was also an obligatory phone call with her sister in which she starts crying due to her alienation to society & her husband, but Johansson's performance here also lacks any kind of emotional depth ) In the end the relationship between Murray & Johansson seems forced and unreal because of this, and although the scenes before their meeting are a wonderful showing of how distant they seem to be from the world they live in, the mediocrity of its script & Johansson's sub par acting destroy any illusion the audience might have that this relationship could be real. As the title suggests, it is also a neverending stream of cringeworthy scenes. While this is ofcourse partly a deliberate move by Copolla since it wants to show us how alienated its characters are, but the constant stream of cringe this picture has become is overdoing it a bit. Many of Johansson's line deliveries are extremely cringeworthy, Murray's commercials are also extremely cringeworthy and will leave the audience embarrassed. A couple of their scenes together such as the one where he reluctantly kisses her in the elevator are also extreme cringe. Because of the plain absurdity of its awkwardness, Lost in Translation does indeed also become quite ridiculous.Lost in Translation has a great Bill Murray performance, some great shots in its cinematography, but it also has extremely weak supporting performances, many absurdly awkward scenes and a mediocre script with not much important dialogue or the building of a narrative, eventually resulting in a disappointment.",4,0,6,7 August 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A true epic of unparalleled proportions, rich in both substance and visual beauty
","As the beginning of arguably the greatest trilogy ever made, The Fellowship of the Ring is a true spectacle in every meaning of the word, fully doing justice to Tolkien's legendary literature.It is very rare these days to find a film that takes so much time by introducing characters & their mannerisms, but Fellowship of the Ring, much in the same vein as the legendary 'Seven Samurai', is one of these films. It is because of this extended exposition of Shire activities that we truly feel connected with the Hobbit characters, whose lifestyle symbolizes that of the average person drowned in ignorance. Director Peter Jackson never seems to be in a rush, and slowly builds his characters this way, while also showing their changes later on in the film, as they have been through more deadly and tragic encounters. Despite these joyous first minutes, Fellowship does a tremendous job in showing what's at stake. There is an atmosphere of impending doom, darkness & shadow in a lot of the later scenes in the film, and every character truly seems to be in peril of some sorts, keeping the audience at the edge of their seats the entire time. I have watched The Fellowship of the Ring countless times now, yet there is a sequence with a broken bridge during the Khazad Dum scenes that still unknowingly made me hold my breath, despite knowing the outcome.This is why the Fellowship of the Ring doesn't feel like the obligatory good vs evil (With good easily triumphing) struggle, but a true world where something is really at stake. Ofcourse the introductory exposition sequence shows this perfectly, where the origins of the Ring are brilliantly explained, with the backdrop of just some of the gorgeous cinematics that the entire trilogy provides. Despite including many fictional creatures such as Elves, Dwarves & Orcs, Fellowship is in fact a very human story about the internal corruption of the mind, and watching it drive apart the Fellowship can truly be seen as poetic.Also featuring a perfect cast, Fellowship has no weaknesses in terms of acting either. Be it Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, John-Rhys Davies as Gimli, Sean Bean as Boromir, Cristopher Lee as Saruman, and even the surprising Elijah Wood as Frodo, this cast is impeccable, and none of the actors truly feel as if they could be replaced. The dialogue spoken is phenomenal. Part of this is probably thanks to Tolkien's superb literature, but nonetheless the dialogue sounds very medieval, and further increases the audience's immersion into the picture, since these people really talk as you would expect them to in a world like this.The original score by Howard Shore is undoubtedly one of the greatest in cinematic history. Particularly his use of leitmotifs is nothing short of spectacular. It should also be noted that the moments of his scores perfectly capture the moment our characters are in, as for example the 'Fellowship' theme is consequently heard in moments where the Fellowship is at its strongest, or during triumphs, but it will be taken over by the corrupted 'Ring' score as the Fellowship slowly disbands. Thus Shore's score tells a story of its own, and it results in one of the most compelling original scores ever created for the big screen.While Fellowship has the leisurely characterization, the tension, and the immersion by knowing that the entire world truly feels at risk, it ofcourse also has external beauty by its astounding visuals. One of the greatest pieces of cinematography ever put to screen, Fellowship is a constant stream of beautiful images. It is surprising how many of these are not computer generated, but instead on location shoots. It seems Jackson only uses CGI on certain things that cannot be filmed naturally (Such as the Balrog), but when it is used, it is also absolutely gorgeous (Again, look at the design of the Balrog for this), resulting in some of the greatest CGI ever made for a motion picture. There are also many stunning widescreen compositions of the beautiful New Zealand landscape, creating a perfect setting for Middle Earth.But i do believe that the most important factor in the success of Fellowship, and the entire trilogy for that matter, is the superb characterization. The brotherly relationship between Frodo & Sam, and the tragic encounters they endure together will never fail to bring tears to the manliest of eyes, because we get to know these characters so well during the introductory sequences. After watching 'The Fellowship of the Ring' for about the hundreth time, it truly feels like coming home, and this is why it just keeps getting better and better.Epic in both scope and scale, vivid in characterization, poetic in shot compositions, filled with tension and raw emotional power, featuring one of the greatest scores of all time, there is no doubt that The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is one of the greatest motion pictures of all time, and rarely shall we see anything that could possibly equal its divine power.",10,2,3,22 December 2018
The Matrix Revolutions," One of the worst movies ever made
","For those who might have though that it couldn't get any worse after The Matrix Reloaded, this is unfortunately a very unpleasant surprise. As if things couldn't get any worse in this franchise, The Matrix Revolutions is one of the worst movies ever made.Obviously the first Matrix was a great film which didn't need 'Reloaded' ruining its legacy and 'Revolutions' destroying it. The problems in Reloaded continue in Revolutions. It has the same idiotic subplots with characters that have people playing them that simply cannot act ( The two women trying to take down the machines is the primary example, with one of them being a supposed tough broad with short hair and a tank top. Just a bunch of feministic nonsense to keep the social justice warriors happy ). The machines invading Zion is unfortunately just an ugly grey CGI fest which leaves no visually lasting impression on any objective person. CGI doesn't have to ruin a movie, but it has to be used only when it has to be used, not everytime they feel like taking the easy route while filming a scene, which is what happened here. Besides, filming a giant battle like that in Zion was doomed to fail anyway, since Zion was already the most uninteresting area from 'Reloaded' due to its bleak, ugly, grey cinematography and terrible characters.The Merovingian, the only interesting character added in 'The Matrix Reloaded' was not used at all except for one scene near the beginning which is just an absolute waste of his character potential. Instead we get to see the annoying kid that idolizes Neo saving Zion while one of those two women ofcourse saves him at the very last second. Not sure what the screenplay writer was thinking in this film, but it seems like he was intoxicated most of the time.Finally we have Neo and Trinity taking the journey to machine city. The movie finds a purpose for Smith in being changed into a rogue program being a threat to the machines and the humans. Yeah, it's terrible writing once again, but he needed to have a purpose for the movie to sell since he was the star villain of the first one. In one of the most terrible uses of CGI ever put to film, we have Neo and Smith face off in the end in a 1v1. They fight while flying in mid-air with the CGI graphics of a 1998 videogame. Where is the brilliance of non-CGI athletic choreography that the original had? Nowhere to be seen whatsoever. We also have a useless subplot of someone in the real world being taken over by Smith yet not killing him when he is blinded for two full minutes, resulting in him getting killed himself, which is ofcourse a terrible hero-villain cliché once again. Smith also seems to suffer from this a lot in the final fight. Despite that he is a rogue computer program, he prefers to preach to Neo instead of defeating him. Neo and Trinity die yet we are not sad for them but happy that this agonizing experience is over. If this kind of thing happened in the original it could evoke emotions in the audience, but not after sitting through this bunch of nonsense.In the end there is probably nothing positive i can say about this film, it is just a videogame ( And not a particularly good one i might add ) with terrible CGI and with a bunch of dumb subplots with characters no one cares about that absolutely cannot act. Forget the sequels, stick to the first one.",1,4,6,26 April 2018
The Thing," The penultimate film about terror and fear through paranoia
","The easiest kind of horror these days are obviously cliché fests overloaden with cheap jump scares. All of which require little in the way of intelligent writing or cohesive storytelling. The Thing (1982) however, takes us back to a time when psychological and intelligent horror films were in abundance, and this is definitely one of the best in that regard.The Thing is undoubtedly one of the scariest movies ever made. There are very little cheap jumpscares, since The Thing focuses on the most difficult kind of horror to create; The psychological. The scare-factor in The Thing is simply because of the combination of excellent framing, eeriness in atmosphere and ofcourse the haunting soundtrack by Ennio Morricone. The extremely disturbing roar for 'The Thing' also contributes to the terrifying feel of it. All of these factors give the audience an uneasy and on-edge feeling that both enhances the tension significantly and creates a haunting atmospheric feeling. Ofcourse the practical effects ( Possibly the most discussed and praised aspect of The Thing ) are also a significant factor in the creation of actual fear and disgust throughout this film. When comparing these special effects to those of a later prequel, The Thing (2011), a painstakingly obvious verdict is that the latter's overuse of CGI really looks phony, ridiculous and not at all scary in any way. You could call the practical effects of The Thing (1982) absurd, and that is exactly what it was going for. The practical effects look disgusting, haunting and menacing. Besides which, the 'Thing' was shown far too often in said prequel, as opposed to the little screen time in this particular film, which significantly drains the tension as the psychological side of a largely unseen 'thing' is about the most intelligent feeling of unease one could get. That is why this is more than just a mere 'monster' flick, as the emphasis is on the tension and paranoia instead of the actual gore.As stated before, the original soundtrack by Ennio Morricone is an absolutely haunting piece that breathes fear ridden atmosphere like no other. A sense of hopelessness, paranoia, and a literal mimic of a human heartbeat are all present in the score. The opening scene of a helicopter attempting to shoot down a dog/wolf while Morricone's score is playing is quite possibly one of the most absorbing, haunting & beautiful opening scenes ever made.The acting is excellent, which is ofcourse a pretty rare thing in a horror film. There isn't a single weak performance visible, and a unique stand-out has to be the half dog, half wolf actor Jed. Never looking at the camera or crew, while maintaining this sense of alienism in him ( Especially the scene where he is first lead to the kennel, followed by his haunting wall-stare ), truly make it seem like this is the actual Dog-thing. Characterization is not as thorough and in depth as for example Alien (1979), but none of the characters are forgettable and each acts according to their personalities. Most of the characters are shown to be resourceful and intelligent, since they quickly figure out the Thing's intentions and origin, as opposed to the usual stereotypical horror dumb characters. There might not be much interesting in terms of the narrative itself, but The Thing's strength comes from the way that the situations themselves are filmed, and director John Carpenter purposely left a lot of key events off-screen, to feed the eager anticipation of the audience even more, and leaves us wondering, just like the characters, who to trust.With very little over the top exposition and a superb flow of visual storytelling ( Like the scene in which 'twoface' revives and assimilates someone, which is shown with a slight movement beforehand while blood starts dripping down, as opposed to ham fisted dialogue ), The Thing is indeed an intellectual piece of horror filmmaking, and Carpenter was ofcourse one of the best in the business at this regard. There is a lot of purposeful ambiguity ( Especially in the much discussed final scene ) which only enhances the paranoid and unknowing feel the audience receives.The Thing is one of the most frightening films ever created, and does this through superb direction and tension building, extremely disturbing and terrifying practical effects, but above all, the creation of paranoia and inner fear and mistrust. When you analyze the situation our characters are in, there are very little films that have a more terrifying premise, since this alien organism is disguising itself as a normal human being, and could be anybody next to you at any time. Thus it is definitely one of the greatest horror flicks ever created.",9,5,9,25 November 2018
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," A gorgeous bunch of nothing
","There is no doubt that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is the weakest entry in the Harry Potter franchise, which furthermore makes me doubt the weird decision of splitting this adaption into two separate films, since basically nothing ever happens in its 2 hour 26 running time.The cinematography is once again astonishing. While not as good as Azkaban's or Half-Blood Prince's cinematography, cinematographer Eduardo Serra does manage to create some beautiful images in this film, but in truth these are images for the sake of being images and not much else, since our three heroes spend hours in some forest in the outdoors while the direction focuses on a couple bits of melodrama & inner struggles, which ofcourse succeeds greatly as a time filler, but in the end it has little context. It starts off with this weird escape from the Dursleys towards the Weasley home ( which i thought was destroyed in Half-Blood Prince, but i guess nothing has to make sense in this movie ), even though the Dursleys was not the place we left off in Half-Blood Prince, making me even doubt how they got there in the first place without the death eaters interfering. Ofcourse, with tension for the sake of being tension they somehow do manage to find the crew when they travel back from the Dursleys, and after some death and injuries they afterwards decide to have a wedding party, which in itself is ofcourse asking for trouble, and it makes little sense in the context of what is happening.We also have a scene at the start to show how 'evil' Voldemort is and how we are supposed to hate him, with some unknown woman who is supposedly a teacher at Hogwarts as captive being killed for liking muggle-wizard connections. Unfortunately, this is not a very subtle way of forcing the audience to direct their emotions of hatred towards him, and since films should always leave that choice to the viewer themselves, or atleast pick a known character to be killed, this scene, like most in Part 1, is a time filler and nothing else.It is a film that is very different from previous Potter films since it seems to be a documentary about forests and outdoor scenery instead of something that is supposed to have an actual plot. The connection between the three main characters has never been worse as it was in the Deathly Hallows: Part 1. All three of them bicker and argue amongst themselves and none of them create any sympathy for the viewer, except maybe Hermione ( Emma Watson ). The biggest problem with this motion picture is that it is simply going nowhere. All the melodrama between Harry, Ron & Hermione is just such obvious filler while they try to charm the audience with its cinematography that it becomes an obvious wasted effort, and after the ending you will probably wonder 'Is that it?', since absolutely nothing happens.It has often been cited as 'Too slow', but that is not the problem at all. The problem is the entire plot is so vacuous of structure and payoff, and while most slow movies have a general core for its narrative or seem to be going somewhere, literally nothing ever brings a payoff in Deathly Hallows Part 1, it simply drowns in all its melodrama and the need to split the novel into two parts. The few action sequences that are there feature a lot of shakycam like Harry Potter has turned into a Jason Bourne film so you can no longer have any idea about what is going on. It hurts the eyes to watch, and it also hurts the eyes to witness this sluggish bunch of nonsense that never goes anywhere.If you enjoy documentairies with great cinematography about forests and general outdoor scenery, this is the film to watch. Otherwise, as something that is not intended as purely a time filler, and having an actual narrative structure, it fails on every aspect, since absolutely nothing seems to happen during the entire course of the film.",5,1,3,28 June 2018
Doctor Zhivago," A beautiful historical epic
","While not quite as good as David Lean's other masterpieces The Bridge on the River Kwai or Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago is still a stunning cinematic achievement. It has, much like the previously named titles, beautiful cinematography & an excellent score by Maurice Jarre once again.The most obvious and greatest thing about this film is definitely the cinematography. It is a beautiful film to look at, with many memorable scenes and extraordinary camera techniques ( Such as the one where it follows Rod Steiger's character sideways from room to room ). The shot right before Zhivago is picked up by the reds when trying to return to his wife is also one that springs to mind, a bit reminiscent of the final scene in The Third Man (1949), the shots of Varykino, the train ride, or any other shot in general of the beautiful winter scenery. It has critically acclaimed cinematography, and for good reason since it is one of the most beautiful movies you could ever see.However, i found that the performances seemed to be a bit flat in general. Omar Sharif doesn't have that ability to absord you as the audience into feeling a lot of sympathy for his character like Peter o'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia could or the raw natural acting talent that Alec Guinness and William Holden show in The Bridge on the River Kwai, except for the couple of teary eyed scenes which he pulled off extremely well. The two women in Zhivago's life, played by Julie Christie & Geraldine Chaplin, also seemed to be able to lack this strong screen presence most characters had in Lean's previous films. The only actors that really had excellent performances were probably Rod Steiger & Ralph Richardson, especially the former as the intelligent businessman. Ofcourse Alec Guinness is in this film too, but surprisingly he also seems a bit flat and does not quite compare to his great role in The Bridge on the River Kwai.The first half of the movie is a character piece whereas the second is more of a romance picture. It does a tremendous job of taking its time to properly set up its characters in the first half of the film, something that if often way too hasty these days. The second probably features more great shots, but still seems inferior to the first as a character development piece. Still, the second half is beautiful enough on its own and as a motion picture it is a stunning achievement.In the end this creates an epic atmospheric historical epic of a film, unfortunately devoid of the performances that made Lawrence of Arabia and The Bridge on the River Kwai stand out, but still a very worthy picture.",8,0,0,21 April 2018
The Intouchables," Inconsistent
","Ofcourse the entire premise of The Intouchables is a bit of a cliché these days with the strong black man helping the weak white man, yet it is not a film of irrelevant political propaganda and steers clears of this subject quite well.The better parts of the film is primarily that it has some great shots, an incredible piece of piano notes music by Ludovico Einaudi & some great acting by especially Francois Cluzet ( Phillipe ) as the invalid aristocrat. Unfortunately however, the bonding of the two cultures of the main characters make little sense. Driss ( Omar Sy ) does not seem like a particularly nice guy and even his family isn't all too keen on him for reasons that he has caused on his own. Somehow for reasons unknown this eventually changes causing Driss to seemingly even care and freak out about things in Philippe's life that seem to be a bit out of character for him. Yet even though their relationship seems far fetched, it does still have a certain charm to it which makes it convincing enough as a piece of entertainment. The acting is mostly good, especially by Francois as stated before, who does a great job of facial acting too. Omar Sy is a bit inconsistent as Driss due to some weird outbursts & a couple of cringy scenes ( the dancing or the consistent flirting with the secretary becomes quite a cringe to watch ) featuring him which kind of makes me think he is the French Chris Tucker. The film isn't as emotionally powerful as it would like to be. The music by Ludovico Einaudi is a splendid emotional piece, so that is not the problem. The problem seems the movie feels a bit too much like a 'feelgood' movie due to the buddy relationship that the mixes between emotion and light hearted feelgood scenes are hard to make. However, a couple of scenes especially near the end do manage to succeed in this aspect, helped by Einaudi's score and some excellent facial acting by Francois Cluzet.The movie is mostly quite grey and not very pretty, and a lot of shots follow Driss closely from over the shoulder resulting in quite an ugly bouncing camera kind of shots. However, there are a couple of shots where the cinematography really shines. Most of these shots come from the position of the camera behind the two men, with Driss left and Phillipe right, which is a pose used many times during the film. Especially the one right before the parachuting scene is a beautiful one, yet this is followed with quite a weird shot in the parachuting scene itself from some kind of onboard camera like it is a documentary, which is unfortunate since there truly are many great shots in the film, but also a lot of uglier ones.It is a film with some great acting and some lesser acting, some great emotional scenes and some cringy scenes, and some beautiful shots and some ugly ones. While overcoming its cliché concept of a story on a splendid manner, it is not quite as great as it wanted to be.",6,8,13,7 May 2018
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Emotionally rich & visually stunning
","The sheer emotion and the fantastic visuals of this entry into the Harry Potter series alone is enough for me to consider The Prisoner of Azkaban as the best in the series. It has a stroke of genius in its immersion that cannot be matched by any other one of the films in the series.Admittedly Alfonso Cuaron changed a lot of things when compared to the first two films by Chris Columnbus. Cuaron wanted to create an extremely dark atmospheric experience that can strike the fear in the hearts of the audience by use of its visuals alone, and he succeeded. The film is much, much darker than the previous two, and while it still has its joyous moments due to the fact that this is only the mere transitioning of the series into more mature territory, it is mostly a very serious film. Like the previous two, the narrative is once again outstanding, its non linear storytelling and use of time travel makes me also consider this film as my personal favorite narrative in the series, and the time travel sequence is quite possibly the greatest sequence in the series too. The introduction of the characters Lupin ( David Thewles ) & Sirius Black ( Gary Oldman ) also proves that like in the previous film, the Chamber of Secrets, the series manages to add new characters that are once again extremely interesting.This truly is the transcending film in terms of the three leads Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint & Emma Watson, as they have evolved into great actors by this film ( Except maybe Radcliffe, who was still lacking emotional intensity in certain scenes, such as the one where he breaks down after eavesdropping on McGonogall and the minister. ). Unfortunately Richard Harris passed away before being able to take part in this third entry and thus was replaced as Dumbledore by Michael Gambon, who is admittedly not as good as Richard Harris, whose soothing presence had no equal. Gambon is not a weak link however, and plays Dumbledore to the best of his ability. David Thewles as Lupin is an extremely likeable but as later discovered also quite a troubled character, but the friendly & kind nature of the way his character is played is simply brilliant. It is ofcourse always a great idea to cast Gary Oldman in a film, as he is one of the most versatile and talented actors to ever grace the screen, and his performance in this film is once again nothing short of spectacular, since the desperation and will for justice basically drips from his face.The cinematography was great in the first two films, but is even better in the third, as it focuses a lot more on outdoor shots and on connectivity of its world than its predecessors. Cuaron wanted to show the audience how the world is connected, with various shots of the bridge making clear that Hagrid's hut is beneath it, and the courtyard before it. It is the most immersive of the series because it makes you memorize the layout with its beautiful connecting cinematography. There are also a lot more shots of beautiful gorgeous scottish-esque natural backdrops of the green plains and mountains, a bit in Braveheart's style, resulting in a visually very pleasing film. The previous two films seemed to be filmed on flat pieces of land which focused more on the sets itself instead of its gorgeous backgrounds.John Williams's score is very different from the previous two films too, since he seems more focused on creating a couple of simple melodies instead of the gigantic orchestral scores in the first two films ( Such as the beautiful score when Lupin and Harry talk about his parents on the bridge ). Buckbeak's flight is also quite possibly the greatest scene in the series due to Williams's incredible score and the gorgeous grassy cinematography, being in stark contrast to Harry's previous life as a neglected cousin of the Dursley's, wheras now he can truly taste the freedom, and it results in a truly beautiful scene.Harry's interactions with Oldman & Thewles's characters are simply dripping of emotion due to its fantastic humane dialogue ( Result of a great screenplay ) and genuine character bonding, and it is truly wonderful how the series make you care about its characters, although The Prisoner of Azkaban is definitely the greatest entry of the series in this aspect.",8,0,2,24 June 2018
Gone with the Wind," Magnificent, but not quite a great film
","There is no question that the pure artistic cinematic achievement of Gone with the Wind is extraordinary as it features one of the greatest pieces of cinematography i have ever seen, but its main purpose of connecting with main characters over such a long journey seems to be lacking a bit and therefore its reputation as one of the all time greats really isn't an objective one.First we should obviously name the good, and the first thing that comes to mind is the cinematography. With such incredible indoor set design, elegant costume design, fantastic camera angles and beautiful outdoor scenery which mostly looks absolutely timeless, it is visually a masterpiece and an absolute delight to the eyes. Take the scene following Scarlett from the crane for example, slowly showing more of the victims of the civil war while Max Steiner's beautiful score plays, resulting in in itself an even emotional scene which also subtly shows us anti-war statements. However, the final scene or the scene right before the intermission with the camera showing silhouette's of characters next to a tree while zooming out when Max Steiner's score hits its climax has to be the ultimate cinematic perfection to such a long epic journey. There are also many of these kind of silhouette scenes throughout the movie, especially the first part before the intermission, and these scenes have once again gorgeous backdrops. As one can tell by my praising above of most of the aspects of the film, there is mostly just one simple detail which alters my perception of the film into just a 'good' one, and that is Scarlett ( Vivien Leigh ). Scarlett is fake, manipulative, selfish, stubborn, immoral & plainly just unlikeable to a degree that you would want her to get shot from the moment you first see her. It is not possible to build an emotional connection with her, and i just did not care at all about what happens to her. Not all characters are this unlikeable, as even the sleazy and arrogant Rhett Butler ( Clark Gable ) has his good moments and is even likeable, or Melanie Hamilton ( Olivia de Havilland ) who is a stark contrast to Scarlett yet somehow the two of them can be best friends which is something that is not very realistic to start with. Unfortunately instead of following Melanie or Rhett we are subjected to 4 hours of torture because we are constantly following Scarlett and her pathetic schemes and cheating along the way. True, main characters do not have to be likeable as long as they are well developed, but Scarlett has to be one of the most annoying irritating leads in a film ever shown, and with a last hour built to severely heighten emotional value, it doesn't work because a connection with her cannot be formed. It also doesn't help that her character development is non existent as she ends as the pathetic cheat that she started out as.A slightly smaller issue is that it is too fast paced, and especially when the final hour draws near main characters start dying one by one but scenes are cut short and are not dragged out which leads to one person dying and the other dying shortly after that while barely showing any of our characters responses to it. ( Except for Melanie Hamilton's, that one was done right ). In a cinematic experience, scenes, and especially scenes like this that are supposed to invoke emotion in the audience, need to be dragged out a bit so you can build a connection to it, but going from one dropping dead to the other dropping dead so quickly is a bit of an anti-climax and lessens the emotional connection because you cannot absorb what has happened before the next thing already happens. It is still such an incredible experience that i cannot truly objective rate it any lower because of the absolutely beautiful cinematography, original score and long running time, but it isn't as immersive as it could have been due to Scarlett's character taking you out of the film and making you care less about what happens to her, and even to most of the people dumb enough to hang around with her. ( For example, Rhett seems like a smart guy, but still wants to marry Scarlett even though he should probably know that would end in disaster ). But its stunning visual beauty cannot be ignored and therefore its positives still far outweigh its negatives.",9,3,6,20 May 2018
Batman Begins," A slightly flawed, but nonetheless fascinating study on moral complexity
","Where most superhero films are immature nonsense with the typical clichÃ©'d 'tyrant' evil villain and the non existent narrative or character development, Batman Begins puts an emphasis on character instead of action, and the result is that here is finally a superhero film that is both mature and impactful due to this.Batman Begins has many changes in the way it tells its narrative. It starts out with a non linear storytelling structure with Bruce Wayne's present intertwining with his child past, whereas later on the present is the only timeline that is being handled. As stated before, the emphasis in Batman Begins is on characterization, and the audience begins to find out through these flashbacks sequences what will motivate the future 'Batman' to don his costume. It is that very fear of bats the young Bruce Wayne is shown to have that he wishes to strike into the hearts of the criminals he fights, and this is a brilliant piece of character writing in itself to make the audience understand this. The gritty way his family is murdered, and the way their killer is shot just moments before assassinating him himself further adds to the escalating need for justice in Wayne's subconscious. The character of Wayne is, due to this interesting narrative structure, quite complete. We understand his struggles, his motivations and his actions. This is a humane character that one cares about.
While the acting is pretty good in Batman Begins, there isn't really a performance that stands out. Everybody was more than adequate, but a surpreme performance seems to be missing. The performance that comes closest to this has to be Michael Caine as Alfred, who shows an impressive emotional range in his care for Bruce Wayne. Christian Bale is a good Bruce Wayne, although not a special one. However, a lot of these performances are also helped by excellent dialogue. Particularly the scenes with Henri Ducard ( Liam Neeson ) & Bruce Wayne are dripping of excellent in depth and intellectual dialogue about the inner depths of the origins of Wayne's fear of bats. Ducard & Ra's Al Ghul and the League of Shadows also bring forth an interesting question about morality, as these vigilante-like killers have a nihilistic kind of vision of Gotham, and believe it should be eradicated as such. However, through certain characters it is shown that there is yet humanity left in this world, and that nihilism is in fact an extremist way of looking at things. Still, we understand the vision of this League of Shadows because Gotham is still displayed as a crime ridden cesspool that does sometimes seem beyond helping.It feels more like a neo noir than a superhero film at times, and it is obvious that a lot of the visuals were highly inspired by Blade Runner. The darkness, the smoke vents, the pratical effects in the stills, it is all very reminiscent of Scott's masterpiece, and the result is that this cinematography really breathes the sleaze, atmospheric darkness and filth of Gotham perfectly. The visuals in itself tell the story of the bleak hopelessness of this corrupted city. The score by James Newton Howard & Hans Zimmer is also a standout as a superb atmospheric piece.This is, however, not a perfect film. The first hour and a half is excellent in non linear storytelling, but it is filmed in a montage style kind of way. For example, a simple shot of Gordon ( Gary Oldman ) entering his office is cut immediately with a shot of him sitting down on his chair. We do not actually get to see him walk up to it and sit down. This is a little example, but it goes on like this for the entire duration. The gaps in the timelines are a bit too large, and it seems to want to go forward at breakneck pace with this editing. While the narrative in Batman Begins is very sophisticated, it features a lot of unnecessary exposition. It is not the kind of film that really allows the audience to think about what is going on due to actions of its characters, and Nolan seems unable to display the emotional state of a character without them verbalizing it. There are also a couple of scenes in which something that is shown some time beforehand is literally repeated, such as the guy in the Wayne Tower repeating what Wayne said will happen if a certain train reaches it. However, as stated before this does not really deter the film from being less sophisticated, and because it is still an intelligent script it is not really insulting to the audience, but there could have been a little bit more subtlety in this narrative. The action sequences in Batman Begins are also nothing above average. It uses a lot of quick edits, shakycam and distorted images which do not really capture anything of the actual fight scenes. I get that Nolan wanted to make it seem like Batman was this lightning fast superhero, but when we do not actually get to see any of it, what is the point? Luckily as stated before the emphasis is not on action but on character in Batman Begins and thus this is not a complete movie ruining factor. Chase scenes are also filmed with an unremarkably low stance camera point of view.Batman Begins has a surprisingly intelligent narrative for a superhero movie, great character development and characterization, a fantastic original score, good acting, a mostly superb script & an interesting duality in the way it handles morality, but it is also lacking a bit in the filming of its action sequence, use of subtlety and the montage like pace.",8,0,1,12 October 2018
Twilight," Might as well have been called 'The Zombie love story'
","I reckon it is no secret that Kristen Stewart is quite possibly the worst actress of all time, especially considering that for some weird reason she is hugely popular despite not having any acting talent whatsoever. The idea about creating a romantic love story between her and someone else is just so laughable due to her zombie-like wooden performances that this is such a terrible film that it basically becomes an unintentional comedy.Well... atleast there is one little thing that Twilight did get right, and that is ( some parts of ) the cinematography. While not consistently visually beautiful some scenes did have some beautiful lightning ( Such as Edward playing the piano ) and some great use of beautiful environments. This is not consistent though, because a lot of the film is also quite pale and grey and ugly, most notably all the scenes that have to do with the school. This is pretty much the only positive thing i took out of this film, though. It is a shallow one dimensional linear cliché'd love story with such obvious and predictable twists and turns while having a terrible screenplay and terrible acting to enhance it.I suppose it no secret that the romance between Bella and Edward is not even close to being believeable by anyone that has a working brain and an IQ that reaches over sixty. Ofcourse it doesn't help that you have the worst actress of all time in the role of Bella, but we'll get to that later. Robert Pattinson isn't a very good actor either since he too has zero personality, and this creates an extremely emotionally vacuous kind of romance which leads into the hilariously comicly bad sometimes and cringy all the time. Their attraction for one another makes little sense since a normal human being wouldn't meddle with the kind of sinister weird type of guy that Edward is, and still meddle with him after he keeps threatening her. but i suppose this film isn't clever enough to understand anything about humans or human behavior anyway.Now i found Scarlett O'Hara for example an incredibly annoying female lead in Gone with the Wind, but it wasn't due to a terrible screenplay or a terrible performance, those were all right in place. It was because she needed to be like that to move the plot forward. What we have in Twilight, however, is an absolutely abyssmal screenplay combined with the worst actress of all time, which results in Bella Swann. 'I don't really like the rain, any cold wet thing i don't really...' 'I mean, you don't even say hi to me'... followed by a 'hi' response are just some basic examples of what a thoughtless mindless dumb insulting screenplay this is. It seems like the scriptwriters wrote this movie specifically for the dim-witted among us since everything is always obvious yet explained about twenty times for no reason. Kristen Stewart unintentionally steals the show with her weird head shaking, zombie like behavior and wooden narration. I sometimes doubt if she is really human since she has no emotional depth whatsoever. Her delivery is absolutely terrible and cringeworthy every single time due to her weird unnatural abnormal behavior.Now we also have the three villain vampires. The reason these three evil vampires are in the film makes no sense other than having to be there to create the cliché hero villain kind of situation. I can fathom the fact that the black guy is the only sensible one of the three ( Even though that is such a lazy political message nowadays ), but what i can't stand is that they have absolutely nothing to do with the main characters and even though there are millions of people in the world to feed on, would still go after Bella who is protected by the only creatures in the world that could possibly be a threat to them. What is the entire point behind these villains? It makes no sense, but then again this script makes no sense anyway. Also let's not forget that the main villain also wants to talk to and film Bella a little bit before killing her so that she can be saved. A typical hero villain cliché once again. The film could have been a bit better with ANY other lead actress, but it still wouldn't have saved the mediocrity of this script and the insulting nature of the film towards its audience.",2,1,5,29 May 2018
The Princess Bride," Pretty good if you look at it from the witty entertainment angle
","A lot of people and critics believe 'The Princess Bride' is a masterpiece and some even believe it is one of the greatest films ever made. However, objectively speaking the movie is not a masterpiece but primarily a highly entertaining escapism flick which still far outweighs its negative sides.Not entirely sure why the film was told out of a book straight from another modern day story, because the modern scenes really seem to have little significance and it also eventually ends up going nowhere. Fortunately, most scenes take place in the historical fantasy setting, which is obviously far and away the most entertaining one. The cinematography is beautiful, with a lot of stunning shots of the beautiful british landscapes where it was filmed on. Also the area where Inigo and the Man in Black face off is worthy of mention as a beautiful piece of cinematography. While being covered in comic aspects, the said scene with the sword fight between Inigo and Man in Black is actually also a masterpiece of choreography and incredible moves, resulting in possibly the greatest single duel swordfight one can ever see in film.The acting was mostly good, especially by leads Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin & Robin Wright. They manage to make their characters likeable due to their natural charm and witty line delivery. A lot of other characters were ridiculously overacted, such as Wallace Shawn's Vizzini. The screenplay is a bit wobbly as a lot of the dialogue is extremely witty and original yet Patinkin's constant uttering of 'Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die.' grows tiresome after a while. Some things are really predictable such as who the Man in Black really is but other things such as Count Rugen's response to the first time Patinkin says the you killed by father line are quite original and somewhat hilarious.It is quite the cliché to say if this movie was serious we might take Elwes & Wright's romance and struggles emotionally serious, but there is still truth to it as it is not the kind of film that leaves you with feelings or thought long after it is finished. It was generally just made as the type of feel good escapism flick and if you limit your expectations of true cinema it can still be considered as a worthy piece of entertaining art. However, anything transcendent or thought provoking it is obviously not therefore it should not be judged like actual masterpieces.",7,1,1,17 May 2018
Saving Private Ryan," An utter masterpiece of visuals and sound, resulting in one of the most immersive war experiences ever created
","The 90s is arguably the greatest decade for master filmmaker Steven Spielberg, with possibly his three greatest films emerging from this era. Saving Private Ryan is one of these three films, and once more shows Spielberg's versatility as a director.Saving Private Ryan consists mostly of a constant use of Steadicam shots, which is these days often confused with 'Shakycam'. When comparing Saving Private Ryan's camera movements to those of the modern action movies of today, what stands out is that it is seemingly only used to heighten the immersion of the scene ( Unlike shakycam ). For example, if there is an explosion, the camera will often move with the tremor of this, and the same is true for heavy gunfire. All of this makes the audience seemingly 'present' in the inhuman war setting that is displayed, and the result is that SPR is undeniably one of the most realistic and immersive war films ever created. This is why, even though the camera is shaking a lot, the situation is still clear, and the audience doesn't miss a whole lot in the overview of the battles. SPR utilizes a lot of long takes that frequently differ from being a complete wideshot to a medium or a close-up, which creates a great variety in shot compositions, and the long takes ofcourse significantly increase the immersion, as every little detail and every piece of movement is there in a single shot, while not having to adjust to the new image of an edit.Yet SPR is not just a constant stream of chaos, as there are also many reflecting scenes between the lines. Many of these 'calm' moments between battle sequences such as the conversations at night in the church, the discussions right before the final battle, Tom Hanks's speech after the bunker attack about his prior job result in a lot of fantastic characterization. All of these conversations will significantly enhance the audience's connection with these characters, as every one of the main characters in the SPR squad is fleshed out and developed, with all of them having defining traits, such as Miller's shaking hands, or Jackson's kissing of the cross. Thus a lot of reason is given to care for the fates of these characters, which ofcourse heightens the emotional core of this film to a high degree.Tom Hanks is, as usual, once again Brilliant as Captain Miller, from the slow motion reflection scenes during battles to his conversations between them, his acting is top notch and once again proves his versatility as an actor, since he has played roles varying from a very low IQ individual, a loner on an Island & a mobster with a lot of conviction. Be it Tom Sizemore, Barry Pepper, Matt Damon or Edward Burns, there is not a single unconvincing acting performance in the film. The dialogue is ofcourse also a fantastic addition ( Particularly the Lincoln quote ) to a good script. John Williams's score is superb, and is one of the most American sounding scores ever created for a film, which makes you wonder if any other movie score could ever be more fitting to the subject in question.With all its technical marvels in the use of the camerawork, there is also a fantastic use of sound, and the battle sequences always feature bombastic sound effects which are usually pitched higher than conversations to truly make the audience hear the terror of WWII. The sound of bombs or gunfire is as terrifying as possibly in SPR, which truly makes the audience feel as if they were there with the characters. Even after all this mayhem, the film still feels as if you are going through Hell, which is ofcourse an extraordinary feat for a film so heavily reliant on extended battle sequences.Saving Private Ryan is a rare example of an action filled anti-war statement, and Spielberg's impeccable direction allows the audience to live and breathe the experience of it, all the while there is also a lot of characterization going on that makes the audience care significantly about what happens to the main characters.",9,1,2,18 November 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," A brainless & cringeworthy cliché fest
","Since i am not a little boy that has an absurd kind of fondness for Marvel comics & thus its movies, i am able to judge them objectively without being prejudiced by a couple of adults flying around in capes. And with this knowledge, it is quite obvious that Infinity War is indeed objectively a terrible movie.As stated before i am admittedly not a Marvel fan, and i did not care to watch any of its predecessors before this one. It ofcourse should never be a requirement to watch about 18 films in order to comprehend this one better, but to be honest you really don't miss anything during Infinity War's simplistic narrative if you have missed all its previous films, except for maybe knowing the characters in it. But judging from what i have seen none of them are even slightly relatable even when having watched previous films. So even if you have watched previous films, a connection with these characters is impossible since they are so terrible written and often times poorly acted.First off, i cannot fathom enough how terrible the screenplay is. A couple of characters try to be funny and come up with lines of dialogue a 8 year old could have though of, such as: 'Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards' or 'Why is Gamora', or the discussion about Thor's new haircut. The plain stupidity in its dialogue and writing is basically an insult to the audience's intelligence, and thus it is a very dumb and low IQ motion picture due to this. The acting is mostly terrible, except by perhaps Josh Brolin ( Which is saying a lot, since he was a pure CGI character ). Especially Robert Downey Jr, Chris Pratt & Tom Holland all hand in absolutely atrocious and horrendous performances. All of them try to be funny and joke around in serious times, but it is never funny, instead its terrible pretentious attempt at creating wisecracks results in loads of cringeworthy scenes that will make the audience embarrassed to witness. Although in the three actors's defence, the abysmal script didn't help their performances either, and they are only partly to blame.The only interesting character in the film is Thanos, and while it does help a little bit that he has the most screen time of all characters by far, he still seems to be a victim of the cliché fest that is Infinity War since his reasons for wanting to take over the world are hardly original ( Sacrifice the few to save the many kind of motivations, which we have all seen before ), and can probably be found in the 'Standard Hollywood villain rules guide book' anywhere. None of the 'Good guys' are relatable because their dialogue is so ridiculous and since the only intelligent person in the film seems to be Thanos, as everybody else seems to be lacking in self awareness and self consciousness on every level ( Especially all the times people who know what Thanos is capable of keep attacking him like they think they have a chance, what a joke that is ).There is once again a lot of sub par plastic cinematography with many artificial backdrops, especially in Wakanda. None of it seems particularly natural, and thus the film also has this visually artificial kind of feel that further decreases your immersion ( Although the characters already decreased this pretty far down with their terrible dialogue ). There is no depth or real sub text in the film except perhaps Thanos showing little Gomora his knife balancing which symbolizes his view of a world in balance, but that is pretty much all the cleverness in it. It also has a lot of melodramatic scenes ( Especially with Vision and that redhead woman whose name i forget ) between characters that you cannot relate with, and the only thing that i wanted to see happen was Thanos killing them all, as he was the only individual with even a slightly bit of depth or character, thus making only him, the villain, relatable. Ofcourse as is standard in modern films Infinity War is also very politically correct in that it uses a lot of women warriors fighting like men against eachother in order to negate gender differences like there are none, which further enhances the notion that this is ultimately an irrelevant film.Admittedly the only strength this film might have comes from Thanos's character, and everything else seems irrelevant due to terrible acting & writing. In the end, despite that a lot of characters meet their demise, it still feels as though nothing is really at stake because all the characters are frequently making unfunny jokes & dumb decisions, which in turn leads to the question: 'Why should we care?'",3,12,26,2 August 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," An absolutely stunning continuation of the franchise
","While The Two Towers introduces a couple of new characters, it is still not exactly on Fellowship's level due to the character development of that particular motion picture. However, it is still painfully obvious that nearly every other single movie pales in comparison to the masterpiece that is The Two Towers.In another comparison to the Fellowship of the Ring, the scale is increased significantly in Two Towers, and this results in a lot more special effect shots. It is not quite as beautiful visually as Fellowship because of this, but like in that film, the CGI that is used is once again utterly fantastic. Still, director Peter Jackson seems to only use CGI on objects or creatures it HAS to be used on, because it would be near impossible to utilize practical effects on certain things, such as the Oliphaunt, or an army of ten thousand Uruk-Hai.With the addition of the 'Rohan' storyline come a couple of new characters, with Bernard Hill as Theoden, Karl Urban as Eomer, Miranda Otto as Eowyn, Brad Dourif as Grima Wormtongue & The motion captured but largely CGI character Gollum 'played' by Andy Serkis. All of these characters are being noteworthy in being a fantastic addition to a cast that was already near perfect.The score by Howard Shore is still perfection, who uses a new 'Rohan' theme to further emphasize emotion when coupled with these scenes. The very first scene in which this sound is heard is when Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas & another individual arrive at Edoras, in which a flag of Rohan can be seen tearing itself away from the King's keep, and landing right before Aragorn, as if it symbolizes that hope is fading, and that only he can return it. The melancholy new sound of the Rohan-esque themes by Shore further fuel this emotion in the audience.The dialogue is once again fantastic. Ofcourse this is once again largely thanks to Tolkien's literature, the poems recited by Theoden or the speech of Sam to Frodo ( By rights, we shouldn't even be here ) result in once again a very human story about hope, friendship and brotherhood. Which is ofcourse another thing that Jackson has succeeded as, the constant lingering fear of hopelessness, only to triumph in a great emotional climax in the end.The acting in the Two Towers is near flawless, and seems to be even a notch above the first one in this aspect. Andy Serkis is absolutely brilliant as the crooked Gollum suffering from a split personality, and his voice perfectly emphasizes this feeling of 500 years of depravity and lust for the ring. Mirando Otto's facial acting when told of Aragorn's 'death' is also worthy of special notice, as the sheer genuine emotion there is almost too much to bear.Once again, the Two Towers takes its time to set up the premise of the Rohan storyline, and does this with excellent characterization & character bonding. However, the build up would be worth less if it wasn't topped off with the incredible climax during the battle of Helm's Deep, which is undoubtedly one of the greatest cinematic sieges ever put to screen. From the very first shots of this massive army marching before the gates of Helm's Deep, you know this is going to be a special piece of filmmaking. Emphasized by gloomy rainy weather conditions and night-time, this siege is highly atmospheric and this does manage to capture the hopelessness of the situation even more. The story of the siege on Helm's Deep is worthy of a movie in itself, as every single new situation brings our main characters ( Who we have grown to care so much about ) in danger. The editing in this sequence, in particular the amount of widescreen shots as opposed to the closer shots of our protagonists fighting off the Uruk-Hai, is once again perfection. It is only when all hope seems lost, with only a couple handful of soldiers left, that our heroes decide to ride out and meet the adversaries, resulting in an incredible triumphant emotional climax as if we were riding besides them. However, the true climax was still yet to come, as a beautiful image of Gandalf appearing in full white with the Rohirrim behind him is seen, followed by a long charge down a very steep hill, combined with extraordinary cinematography & Shore's incredible score, resulting in one of the greatest charges ever filmed. The emotional satisfaction in this is inhumanly high, and the fact that the victory is pronounced over Sam's very human speech to Frodo makes it even more involving and emotional.The Two Towers is the weakest link in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which is admittedly not saying much, since there are very few films that can possibly compete with it. Featuring superb acting, fantastic dialogue, excellent slow paced characterization, an even more impressive Howard Shore score, gorgeous cinematography & one of the greatest sieges of all-time, The Two Towers is indeed one of the all-time greats of motion pictures.",10,2,2,23 December 2018
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," One of the most inhumane and emotionally deadening movies ever created
","The first Twilight was already a disaster, and i thought to myself , 'This one couldn't possibly be any worse'. Unfortunately this assumption was incorrect and thus we have an even inferior sequel to an already terrible original film. Like the first one, New Moon doesn't seem to understand anything about humans and human emotion, which isn't a surprise since i would have expected this after the first one. However, New Moon seemingly takes itself a lot more seriously than the first one because there are numerous melodramatic scenes with cringy dialogue, terrible acting and with some music added to it like this was something that was supposed to invoke emotions in the audience. The combination of writing and acting doesn't really get any worse than this, but atleast it still somehow works as an unintentional comedy of sorts, as i found myself laughing through a lot of parts of the film that weren't supposed to be funny ( Especially Bella's performance with Volturi ). Like the first Twilight, New Moon also keeps insulting the audience's intelligence with its dumb flashbacks right after something from the past has been said, like we needed to be told twice because otherwise we wouldn't understand.Kristen Stewart is once again terrible as Bella Swann, Robert Pattinson is also extremely unabsorbing as the completely uninteresting Edward & the addition of Taylor Lautner ( Jacob Black ) as a main character now has also not helped the movie to go forward. It really seems to me all of the actors in this franchise never even went to acting school, as all of them put emphasis on parts in sentences that i have never heard before and none of the actors seem to even understand what they are saying ( Especially Stewart, who is frequently seen shaking her head after a line or stating a long 'uhmmmm.....' before a line ). The narrative structure is even worse than the first, as simply for plot reasons and nothing else Edward leaves Bella so when the obvious later happens ( He returns, obviously ) it is supposed to invoke emotions in us as the audience, but this lazy writing really doesn't get through to the objective movie watcher. Bella's depression state is obviously not convincing at all due to Stewart's wooden, emotionless & unimmersive and non existent acting talents that the audience does not feel anything for her at all, since we are always reminded by her terrible performance that we are watching a movie instead of being absorbed into its world ( And a particularly bad movie aswell ). The CGI of the wolves is terrible, but the way they walk is even worse, as if it were straight out of a superhero kind of videogame. The remaining 'evil' vampires make a return for no apparant reason other than as the black guy whose name i forget states 'to kill Edward's mate as he killed Victoria's mate', yet we are supposed to believe these vampires are more than animalistic monsters ruled by instinct, yet the movie contradicts itself here once again, and all for the sake of there being some would-be tension. ( Tension, however, only works if you care about its characters, and quite frankly, you don't. ) In the end nothing at all is done with their storylines, and you keep wondering to yourself what the use of them was.It is, even more so than the first, a constant abundance of cringeworthy scenes followed up after one another because it takes itself even more seriously than the first because of its extremely melodramatic scenes which features actors who never even went to acting school and are only capable of literally reading cue cards. Oh, and yes, it is just as insulting to the audience as the first one was, if not more.",1,0,1,16 June 2018
The Dark Knight," Atmospheric, yet also muddled & forced
","The Dark Knight is, like Batman Begins, an atmospheric piece of work that captures the filth of Gotham City very well. It is, however, not as good as Batman Begins since it seems to be a constant montage of anticipation of/and action sequences themselves.The only aspect of The Dark Knight that was improved upon from Batman Begins are the action sequences. The ASL ( Average Shot Length ) in these sequences is a lot higher and we can now actually see what is going on in the fight scenes. There are still however a lot of fights later on in the film that feature a lot of amateurish shakycam camerawork, but it is common knowledge that Nolan's strength is not his action sequences, and the problem with The Dark Knight is that it nearly consists of wholly action sequences or the build up towards them. Car chases are still unremarkable while being filmed with low camera standpoints combined with inside shots of characters ( In the police vans ) we know nothing about. For some reason Nolan believes it to be necessary to show these unknown characters reactions to create some kind of cheap immersion.The Dark Knight has pretty cinematography, sure. Like Batman Begins, it captures a visual atmosphere that complies with its overseriousness and dark tone. It is still not as atmospheric as the neo noir cinematography of Batman Begins, so the visuals might not be as fitting as they were in the previous entry, but standing alone it does provide some interesting images, such as the one of the Joker taunting Wayne to hit him in the middle of the street, or the entire trackingshot of the Joker attempting to blow up a hospital. It is all great to look at, but once again it doesn't quite capture that darkness and sleaze that Batman Begins did due to its Blade Runner-esque stills and smoke vents.The acting is pretty good from most of the cast, except that Maggie Gyllenhaal is a significant step back from Katie Holmes's portrayal of Rachel. Much has been said about the praising of Heath Ledger as the Joker, who undoubtedly delivers an adequate performance albeit a bit overly theatrical. The tongue flicking, cue laughing, hair touching all becomes a little bit cliché after a while, but at least his antics are interesting to witness. His character in reality isn't very well written, as even though he isn't the typical 'Villain motivated by only money', he is still only motivated by one thing, which is chaos. The Joker is a psychopath with no honor to morals whatsoever, and the kind of writing for this simplistic psychopathic villain isn't really a stroke of genius on anybody's part, because his motivations are even lazier than the cliché money obsessed villains. There is little room for character development due to the constant barrages of would be tension and action sequences. Only Harvey Dent has a character arc, and this arc is really once again the result of poor writing, as he changes from the idealistic hero of Gotham City to a revenge ridden monster due to one traumatic event. This is a character arc we have all seen before, and it is not original by any means. Not to mention the fact that he rips off No Country For Old Men's Anton Chigurh with his coin clip.The Dark Knight is also muddled in its morality. It tries to create duality and discussions about right and wrong in its actions, but Nolan himself doesn't even seem to know what he wants here. The later stages of the film feature moral dilemma after moral dilemma which constantly forces the viewer into these life and death kind of situations. It really is a poor excuse for lack of storytelling and character to bring forth these cliché sequences constantly. It truly seems to believe it is telling something about human morality, but it is in fact only using these moments as disguise for the weakness in its writing & character.Like Batman Begins, it constantly follows a montage like overly fast pace that decreases the audience's immersion significantly. This is coupled with a lot of irrelevant scenes such as Reese's attempted blackmail. There are a lot of over dramatic conversations in which the camera is constantly spinning around characters for some reason ( Much like in House of the Dead. Not that i am insinuating that The Dark Knight is as bad as that one, since that is ofcourse a great insult to the latter. However, these pretentious dynamics in camera movement do not have any place in this film. )The Dark Knight has generally good acting, nice cinematography creating an atmospheric city albeit in lesser proportions than Batman Begins did, decent action sequences ( Especially for Nolan standards ), but it is also muddled in its view on dual morality. These situations are constantly repeated throughout the film which really makes it border on pretentiousness. The narrative isn't as complex and sophisticated as Batman Begins, but it still slightly succeeds as a reasonable film with a lot of visceral thrills.",7,1,1,13 October 2018
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Like a firmly built bridge in connecting the series, but not very memorable on its own
","While it is a step up from the previous film, the Goblet of Fire, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix still does not quite capture the figurative 'magic' that the first three ( Especially the third ).In the Order of the Phoenix, like in the first two movies, a lot of the scenes seem to take place indoors and are mostly beautifully lit as opposed to the Goblet of Fire which thrived on digital outdoor backgrounds which mostly looked pretty ugly, and therefore the cinematography is a bit better once again, but still not as good as the sweeping shots of the green plains and mountains were in the Prisoner of Azkaban. Its narrative is, also unlike the first three, not really anything special in this one, as Harry gets falsely accused, keeps having nightmares about you know who ( Which also happened in the Goblet of Fire ), while a corrupt ministry of magic lackey is trying to take over Hogwarts, all in a very linear fashion. There is little of the mystery & surprise that the Chamber of Secrets or Prisoner of Azkaban had.The camaraderie between the three main characters Ron, Harry & Hermione does fortunately seem to be back, after Ron's weird fits of jealousy and unprovoked anger seemed to come out of nowhere in the Goblet of Fire which severely damaged these ties with the audience. It is also admirable how much better Rupert Grint & Emma Watson have become as actors after maturing with age, although Daniel Radcliffe sadly seems to be stuck on his level, as he could never really pull off the conflicted & angry Harry Potter that he is supposed to be in the Order of the Phoenix. It is less amibitous than the Goblet of Fire, with a lot less new characters being introduced, and on the contrary to its predecessor, most of the new characters in this film are indeed interesting. Especially Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge puts in a phenomenal performance as one of the most hatred-inducing characters ever put to films. Her snobby, arrogant & know-it-all behavior which seemingly cannot be stopped by anyone will make the audience want to gouge her eyes out, which does in turn improve immersion into the film since you want to know her fate. Helena Bonham Carter is also quite the cast for the crazed Bellatrix Lestrange, who embodies her insanity perfectly. Evanna Lynch, while not seemingly such a great actress at this point, is however simply the perfect cast for her character Luna Lovegood as this character is supposed to be quite odd and eccentric in her own way.The special effects are most of the time well made, with this film featuring another spell-clashing scene, like the Goblet of Fire. However, the forced way of including Voldemort in the later scene of the film seemed to be a bit out of place, and only there to convince the Minister that the dark lord is indeed back and regaining in strength, which furthermore feeds my throughts about this mostly being a filler in the series. Unlike in the Goblet of Fire, the death of a character in this one ( Sirius Black ) does tug at the heartstrings a bit, since in both this film and in Azkaban we create a bond with his character, since his fatherly role to Harry and brilliant performance by Gary Oldman created one of the best characters in the franchise. Which is ofcourse in stark contrast to the previous death of Cedric Driggory in Goblet of Fire who you don't care about so much. However, Harry's denial of Voldemort controlling his thoughts is quite lame ( I have friends and you don't, therefore i have something to live for...., not great writing there ).While it introduces some good characters and features great camaraderie between its characters and has some emotional connection at the end, the relatively simple narrative and overly politically influenced plot do little to capture that magic that Harry Potter is famous for, and most of the time feels like a filler if nothing else. It will not go down as one of the best in the series, but it is still a solid continuation of it due to the strength of the bonding of its characters.",7,1,1,26 June 2018
The Graduate," A brilliant depiction of personal alienation
","Most of the kind of flicks like the Graduate, which rely on showing the alienation of a main character to society, cross the line towards the cringeworthy, creating an unpleasant and uneasy feeling for the audience. The Graduate, however, manages to depict this alienation in such a relatable fashion that there is no real cringe to speak of.Dustin Hoffman deserves a lot of credit for his role in the film. He was reportedly the same kind of person as his character ( Ben Braddock ) and it definitely shows that he was born to play this role. His nervously having to wait for two different generations of people before going through a door, or his lack of attempting to 'Call' to a waiter while instead just pointing behind his back, it all shows that this is a person that is uneasy and alienated to the society he lives in. This could have easily been cringeworthy, but Hoffman's acting feels so raw and the screenplay feels so realistic that one can only stare in awe at how accurate this depiction is. Ben starts out as the gullible alienated schoolboy but evolves towards a determined human being towards the end of the film, resulting in a great display of character development. Anne Bancroft as Mrs Robinson, Murray Hamilton as Mr. Robinson and in a bit lesser terms Katharine Ross as Elaine are also performing to the best of their abilities which in turn makes the acting in The Graduate one of its many strengths.It is a motion picture filled with subtle and artsy metaphors and symbolisms, and a lot of fantastic visual storytelling. Examples of this are the shot of him before the fish tank, which symbolizes his jumbled view of life at that point. Not yet knowing what his purpose is, and what he strives to be. Another example is the famous under the legs shot with Ben in the background which shows us exactly how hard to refuse the seduction must have been for his already quite compliant character ( At that point ). Or the fantastic scene near the end which shows us a camera position in the distance that Hoffman is running to the entire time, which tells the story in visual terms that he is running but not getting any closer, and only when the camera zooms out and a certain building is revealed on the left side of the screen we suddenly see that this was merely a diversion and that his goal was indeed nearby the whole time. Due to this fantastic visual storytelling, the audience will start to create quite a sympathetic feel for the protagonist since this subtly tells us what his inner struggles are.The Graduate appreciates the audience's intelligence, and doesn't use any more dialogue than is necessary. It isn't ham fisted, and it features a lot of montage scenes which focus solely on the facial expressions of its brilliant cast of characters to tell the story, while using brilliant photography, cinematography, innovative camera angles & shot variety to truly immersive the audience into its environment. Instead of an orchestral original score by an acclaimed film composer, The Graduate cast Simon & Garfunkel as the musical additions to the film, and their songs perfectly capture what Ben is going through throughout the film. Many scenes include Ben reflecting on his life while Simon & Garfunkel's fantastic iconic music plays, and it fits perfectly with the narrative.The greatest scene has to be the superb final one, namely when they are on the bus itself. While Simon & Garfunkel's fitting ( Because the scene has no dialogue ) Sound of Silence plays, our main characters are seen in joy after disrupting Elaine's wedding and making it towards the bus which will make them live happily ever after. That is, if director Mike Nichols cut the scene short for about 20 seconds. The smiles slowly disappear and some 20 seconds long our characters monotonously stare in front of themselves which symbolizes the fact that both characters know what they are getting into and know that their path ahead will be difficult. And it is this sense of self awareness that makes this film stand out so much from your average coming of age film. It could have easily ended 20 seconds earlier with both characters smiling and riding off into the sunset, but Nichols left on a stunningly realistic ambiguous note with both characters realizing they have obstacles to overcome, and can not yet live happily ever after. In a slight complaint, for such a subtle film the depiction of the parents as indoctrinating monsters is slightly overdone and lacks obvious subtlety, yet it still helps the narrative forward.It is the kind of film that relies heavily on human emotions & uses a lot of facial expressions and visual storytelling to create this emotion. It has brilliant acting, a great screenplay, a great score by Simon & Garfunkel, great cinematography, and above all fantastic direction, which all creates a succesful study on society alienation and overcoming indoctrination.",8,2,2,9 September 2018
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Too much anticipation for nothing
","Breaking Dawn - Part 2 is indeed the best entry to the Twilight Saga series, though admittedly this is not saying much. I guess the correct term for this one is that this one is 'The least terrible' of them all.Atleast after five movies the writers have finally given us a reason as to why Jacob Black is attracted to Bella, even though it doesn't make a lot of sense since the person Black imprinted on was not even close to being born for most of the Saga, but apparently werewolves can also predict the future without them knowing it. There still is no reason as to why Edward is attracted to her though, and as usual in a Twilight film there are a couple of terrible romantic scenes between them once again, although thankfully this was a lot less frequent when compared to Part 1. The opening title sequence was very good, partly due to the impressive score by Carter Burwell, but straight afterwards this is basically thrown overboard with a terrible vampire running scene with Bella and Edward which feature absolutely terrible CGI and abysmal looking greenscreens in the background like we were watching some kind of terrible videogame. The 'tough girl' Bella character just doesn't impress me. The scene when she raises her voice against Jacob is just laughable at best, since it is as is usual with Stewart such a forced expression that is visibly literally taken straight out of distant cue cards and spoken without any natural kind of conviction. The mother-daughter relationship that could have made this movie into something doesn't have any chemistry which is ofcourse the result of Kristen Stewart not being able to develop chemistry with whatever other human being on the planet anywhere.The entire narrative of the movie is basically one idiot vampire claiming false claims against the Cullen's & Bella for no apparent reason so a confrontation can be had with the Volturi ( Yeah, it is terrible writing, as is the whole series ), followed by the Cullen's gathering allies to convince them that it wasn't true, or otherwise make a stand against them if they do not listen. While all of this seems to be an irrelevant bunch of nonsense only there to fill up the running time, the final confrontation is definitely the best scene in the series. One of the biggest problems with the action sequences in the series is that it is lacking in any kind of tension since you know none of the good guys will die, but in the final battle this is changed drastically and a lot of the protagonists meet their demise in the battle against the Volturi's, resulting in possibly the only tense encounter in the entire series, because finally anything could happen. All the while this is accompanied by Carter Burwell's fantastic score and some gorgeous snowy cinematography, i admit i was quite starting to like it at this point. However, in the end it all turns out to be a vision created by Alice after which the supposed 'mighty Volturi' leave with their tail between their legs, and nothing ever happens. In the end you realize Twilight is still Twilight, and nothing holds any significance as nothing tragic can ever happen in this childish fairytale. There is never any real danger, or any real threat, and for a moment you thought this was gone in the battle sequence, after which the audience will be left severely disappointed. While it features an amazing score by Carter Burwell & a lot of gorgeous cinematograpy which is admittedly the best in the series ( Although also quite a lot of ugly greenscreening ), this movie's strength comes solely from it's battle sequence near the end, which ends up being an illusion, which in turn leaves you wondering: 'What the hell was the point of all this?'",4,0,2,21 June 2018
Life Is Beautiful," Mediocre film that doesn't understand what it wants to be
","It shouldn't be surprising that this movie isn't a very great one, as it is very hard to take a matter like the holocaust and try to create a parody of it as Benigni tries to do here. Yet it has been done before succesfully, but unfortunately Life is Beautiful is not one of these instances.It seems to be a movie with the central message that you can find hope in anything or anyone, yet it comes off as a sitcom with jokes you just can't seem to laugh about. Benigni himself was overacting like a madman the entire film, yet comically, dramatically and emotionally he does not seem to make any dent whatsoever. The story is also rushed. He suddenly has a child and expects that this is his free ticket in order to feel sympathy for his character, yet it comes across as a cheap way to get the audiences undeserved sympathies. Benigni uses cliché'd jokes that we have all seen before, rendering it inaffective as a comedy film. The movie doesn't take itself seriously enough in its seemingly serious setting of the holocaust, making it also fail as a dramatic or emotional film. Ofcourse Dr Strangelove by Kubrick is an example of where it actually works to create a comic effect over a serious matter, but this is generally because the comic aspect is a lot funnier, the dramatic aspect is a lot more plausible, Peter Sellers is simply a better actor than Benigni, and the film knows at all times it does not take itself seriously, unlike this one.The cinematography is alright, but nothing special. There are a couple of nice landscape shots and the scene where the train arrives are quite nicely filmed, but it is nothing to cry home about. The music is decent, but not enough to make you emotionally involved in the picture like Ennio Morricone's score for fellow italian film Cinema Paradiso (1988) managed to do so well. There are also a lot of scenes in the latter part of the film where particular scenes could have easily been drawn out to create a more dramatic effect, yet Benigni cuts everything short and everything seems to end way too abruptly and quickly, negating any kind of emotional connection you might be starting to feel. I would say despite the fact that Benigni was even worse in the first half of the film, i would still prefer the first over the second, as atleast it seemed to know which direction it was going at that point, but in the second it turned into an unfocused mess of sillyness to the point where we cannot absorb any kind of dramatic or emotional impact we were supposed to get.If you ignore all these obvious issues, which i am certain a lot of people did, some might consider it a movie with a message, yet you are indifferent to any possible message since the characters seem indifferent to the situation.",4,3,9,22 April 2018
Titanic," Massive in scale but little in actual substance
","It is quite easy to be swept away by Titanic's outstanding cinematography or exceptional musical score, and as a result a lot of its obvious flaws and faults seem to be overlooked. As an objective viewer however it is quite obviously an unfortunate disappointment.As stated before the cinematography in Titanic is fantastic, with a lot of widescreen shots of the ship from high angles. A couple of scenes such as the attempted Rose suicide near its start or when the final part of the ship goes down do look pretty bad and fake though, but for most of the film it looks pretty beautiful. The indoor set design is also amazing, and it basically breathes 1912 to look at its elegant and artistic design. The musical score by James Horner is also ( as to be expected from him ) a beautiful emotional piece that seems to fit extremely well in Titanic. However, while it is a very stylish film this way, it doesn't manage to be impressive on the actual substantial aspects of cinema, such as its acting or its screenplay, which are both very inconsistent to say the least. Billy Zane, Kathy Bates & Bernard Hill are some examples of actors/actress who do show a impressive performance, but Kate Winslet as young Rose has this monotone emotionless look on her face all the time, and i find it hard to see what Jack ( Leonardo DiCaprio ) sees in her because of this. Winslet is not capable of acquiring the emotional intensity that is required for a role such as this, since her acting is so theatrical and not very natural. While DiCaprio is a fantastic actor, he seems to be struggling in every scene in Titanic, primarily because he is simply miscast. He is not the type of actor for a supposed heart tugging romance, and he is thus unable to truly capture the essence of their bond. ( For an actually GOOD young DiCaprio role, watch the Basketball Diaries (1995) )Unfortunately James Cameron not only wanted to direct, but also write a film as grand in scale as this one. This results in a pretty mediocre screenplay and dialogue that a kid could have come up with. Titanic offers little sub text, symbolism or depth since its writing is sub par to say the least. There are a lot of corny moments and cliché dialogue ( The entire scene of Rose discovering Jack's talent for drawings for example ) and all the while it has very little subtlety and it is unable to tell the audience something without blatantly having some character saying it, which in itself is ofcourse an insult to the audience's intelligence, and it results in Titanic being quite a poorly written movie that is not intelligent and most of the time just plain dumb.The first part of the film seems more like a social commentary instead of a film, as Cameron tries his best to show the audience what a bunch of snobbish unlikeable & arrogant folk the rich people are, and how outgoing and free the poor people seem to be. This might not have been so bad, if Cameron actually managed to be subtle in this matter, but this was not the case, as for example Billy Zane's character Cal is such an unsubtle way of telling the audience that the rich are bad. Ofcourse no offense to Billy Zane, who was great as his character, but his entire character is utterly ridiculous and he is unable to perform a single likeable action throughout the entire film, and this never changes. We get it Cameron, the rich guy is the bad guy, no need to shove it down our throats. Cameron's greatest mistake seems to be the decision to write the movie himself instead of bringing in an experienced screenplay writer.The second half of the film is more of a disaster movie, and it isn't so different from your average modern day monster blockbuster, except the monster in this film is the water. Even if there were any hidden meaning behind the first half of Titanic, the second half contains no depth whatsoever, and shows us the demise of a lot of characters nobody knows and nobody cares about. In the end we don't really care that much about Rose and Jack either, since their acting was not up to the challenge and the dialogue provided by Cameron was not fantastic either. It also shows us multiple instances of weird moments of self sacrifice, with people sacrificing themselves for no obvious reason instead of trying to escape. While this might be realistic in a film about the Japanese bushido code, in Titanic it feels out of character and it just doesn't fit, since these are all normal people who should want to simply get on with their lives.Cameron might show some images to impress the audience with his take on this real life tragedy, ( The opening scene with the old footage of Titanic actually setting off with Horner's score is ofcourse fantastic ) but in substance Titanic is severely flawed and the experience of watching it is therefore less immersive which in turn makes it lack the emotional impact it should have had.",5,3,10,13 July 2018
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," The 'Wizard of Oz' of a different generation
","Much like the film in said title, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone seems to essentially be a nice kind of kiddy escapism flick into the world of magic, but like The Wizard of Oz, it still manages to be surprisingly touchy in a profoundly humanistic kind of way despite its far fetched story. I grew up with these series, and thought they were the greatest thing i have ever seen at the time. Now that i have grown older and judge all cinematic feats objectively, Sorcerer's Stone might have lost some of its figurative magic, but it is still an impressive and genuinely entertaining film. After having recently been through the torture of seeing the entire Twilight saga series, it is nice to see a film series such as Harry Potter that DOES actually have great writing and for the most part good acting, and manages to be believeable in the setting it provides. Dumbledore, who is the most important character in the film, and his dialogue with Harry in front of the mirror shows us that the film manages to still be relevant to actual family values and issues while subtly lying under its gorgeous magical cover. Visually the film is stunning due to the fact that the filmmakers wanted to give it that authentic look, resulting in many on location shots. The outdoor shot of the first time seeing Hogwharts is simply visual delight in what could have easily been an ugly CGI snoozefest. The great hall ( Which was not on location and actually built for the film ) is also fantastic visual beauty, and the high camera angles show us a great overview of the entire room while this is coupled with John Williams's fantastic score, which uses fantastic chords of joy and happiness in the light hearted scenes while still maintaining that ominous mystery feel in the darker scenes, such as the Unicorn search in the dark forest. Williams's score for this film is definitely one of the greatest in the history of film due to the fact that it captures the adventure, joy, mystery & evil of the film like no other. Its three main characters Harry, Ron & Hermione, who were ofcourse still very young child actors at the time, are surprisingly genuinely enthusiastic and natural about the happenings in the film, and while they will never be the true star of it, they definitely do not drag the film down. However, there are indeed fantastic acting performances in the film, especially by Alan Rickman ( Snape ) whose subtle slow way of speaking is intimidating in its own right, and Richard Harris ( Dumbledore ), who captures the wise and friendly aspect of his character as only Harris can, with his calm demeanor and naturally fatherly character, which only makes it sadder he passed away before the making of the Prisoner of Azkaban, as a Dumbledore as good as Richard Harris's will never be seen.The narrative of the film is great, with us slowly beginning to understand more about the plot as it unfolds. It doesn't insult any type of audience with obvious dialogue or flashbacks ( *Cough* Twilight * Cough* ) and instead lets the mystery unfold into logic on its own. All three main characters embody their characters perfectly as each is used to the best of their abilities throughout an event in the story, which will make sure none of them seem irrelevant, and all of them give a clear view of what they are like.It is a grandiose spectacle of visuals and magic, and while obviously lacking in real depth it is also a genuinely human story about an orphan ( Harry ) who finds friendship and courage through a series of brave events.",7,0,1,22 June 2018
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Ambitious and innovative, but due to little emotional power and quite ugly cinematography it ranks as one of the weakest in the series
","After the extraordinary Prisoner of Azkaban there is no doubt that it was hard to live up to its reputation, and The Goblet of Fire definitely did not manage to do that, as it is definitely the weakest of the bunch up to this point.The biggest problem with this entry when comparing it to its predecessor is its use of digital backdrops instead of natural ones. This is also a part where The Prisoner of Azkaban shines in so brightly, as it used a lot of gorgeous backdrops of natural surroundings and showed a lot of interconnectivity of its area's to create a truly immersive experience. In the Goblet of Fire, many of the outdoor shots are bleak, colorless & quite ugly, and after the incredible cinematography that Azkaban had, the Goblet of Fire just looks like its ugly auntie. Also, this is, like Reign of Fire (2002) once again an absolute insult to common mythology as it is common knowledge that Dragons have four legs, and not two like in this film. The correct term for this creature should be 'Wyvern' instead of Dragon, as they do walk on two legs like the ones in this movie do. The previous two movies were exceptional at introducing new characters, but in this film this is not so much the case, except for Brendan Gleeson ( Moody ) who was, ofcourse, brilliant as usual as this completely mad and insane yet mostly likeable character. However, the addition of two schools of who we have never heard of and its colorless characters such as Krum or Fleur Delacour definitely does not help give the film character. Ofcourse i do not need to explain to people who have seen Twilight what a terrible actor Robert Pattinson ( Cedric ) is, and it is no different in this film. Luckily, he was only used sparingly and his dialogue is quite limited.Another obvious problem is the lack of a John Williams score. The composer Patrick Doyle tries to give it his best but he is obviously no match for Williams, and the score for this film is not memorable in any way, which is in stark contrast to the extremely emotionally powerful scores the first three movies had. The result is the iconic feel of the series is kind of gone, and a great part of it is due to Williams's departure from the series.In the end the film really isn't about anything. It's about a tournament with three deadly objectives just for the sake of 'Tradition and honor'? It seems so out of place after what we have seen in the first three films, in which the narrative seemed logical and humane, but in the Goblet of Fire the narrative seems to be there for the sake of being a narrative, and not much else. There is also a gigantic ball scene with a lot of characters no one cares about and Ron who always seems pissed off at either Hermione of Harry for no obvious reason, which significantly lowers the audience's connections with its three main leads which has been established so wonderfully in its predecessors.Luckily there still is the final half hour, as the graveyard sequence and Voldemort's resurrection is quite fascinating to behold, although it still has its flaws. It is said many times that Voldemort was scarier when he was not fully seen, and there is truth to this, yet i still find it that this scene is the most memorable in the film due to the exceptional special effects clashing of the wands and the fantastic Ralph Fiennes ( Voldemort ) performance. However, it seems he was so obsessed with himself that he let a hollywood cliché get the better of him, preferring to talk Harry to death instead of actually trying to kill him, and this admittedly makes Voldemort less intimidating compared to how intimidating he was in its predecessors when not being seen. Cedric's death is supposed to be an emotional moment after this, but we do not really actually know Cedric's character or what good he has done except tip Harry off about the dive objective, and therefore an emotional connection with his character cannot really be formed which results in his death not affecting the audience that much.It is by no means a bad film overall, as its costume design, parts of indoor cinematography and acting by most of the established actors is still pretty good, but for a Harry Potter entry it is definitely a let down. Oh well, atleast the audience has the joy of seeing that annoying guy from Twilight get killed. That alone makes sure it still deserves some praise.",6,3,12,24 June 2018
The Happening," What? No!
","... As stated by Mark Wahlberg in the 'The Happening'. This absolutely phenomenal and in depth dialogue really describes this film perfectly. It is obvious Wahlberg was breaking the fourth wall at this particular moment while referring to the film.In all honesty though, i can and will never understand how this film is directed by the same director as the masterpiece 'The Sixth Sense'. M. Night Shyamalan isn't know for his consistency, but the difference in quality between these two films is just enormous. There is probably not a single other director out there that has a greater gap in the quality of two of his films. There is just no explanation how Shyamalan turns from The Sixth Sense to this bunch of nonsense. With the knowledge that Shyamalan is in fact actually capable of producing something amazing, the fact that this film is such utter trash really supports the suggestion that this was done on purpose.Now for the substantial part... The Happening is horribly acted, lazily and poorly written & terribly framed and photographed. Now, Mark Wahlberg is an actor that in the past has proven himself to be an adequate factor in most of his films ( See his performances in either Boogie Nights or The Departed ), so his absolutely atrocious performance in this film is for the most part also thanks to Shyamalan, who also wrote the screenplay. Shyamalan's screenplay is full of illogicalities and unintentionally funny moments. There are so many scenes in The Happening where something bad happens, and never do any of the character seem to react to it. They just stand there, not moving, like a bunch of 'uninvolved observers!' as Zooey Deschanel states. This is a recurring theme throughout the film. There is for example a scene in which some people hear a gunshot from behind a hill, and they do absolutely nothing. They do not run away or run towards it. They just do nothing except stare in front of themselves. There is also a scene where two characters are blown away by shotguns from inside a house on a porch, after which two other characters sit in front of said porch for another two minutes while the shotgun guys are still in there. Wahlberg also talks to a tree, which is saying enough. There is also a lot of irrelevant newspaper exposition, which is ofcourse one of the most annoying forms of exposition because it involves characters nobody knows who talk about circumstantial things which do not tell the audience anything we did not already know. But hey, Shyamalan thinks his viewers are idiots, so why not? In short, all of these nonsensical character moments make this one of the worst screenplays ever made.As for the acting, everyone is complete garbage. Mark Wahlberg, who as stated before is definitely not a bad actor, obviously doesn't look like he wants to be in this film, perhaps due to some feeling of shame as he must have already felt how terrible this was going to be. Unfortunately for him, this performance does really make him seem like a bad joke, although Shyamalan's dialogue doesn't help either. His immortal sarcastic utterly unconvincing line delivery of 'What? No!' really emphasizes his will of being in this film. Although once again there is a lot of dialogue that no actor could have pulled off convincingly. Zooey Deschanel is nearly as bad as Wahlberg, but i think if the screentime of both characters were reversed that these roles would also be reversed, since she is too absolutely terrible. 'Just when you thought there couldn't be any more evil that can be invented' is ofcourse a terrible line of dialogue by Shyamalan, but Deschanel's delivery is something else entirely.The cinematography is plain bloated and ugly, with absolutely terrible framing. There are many weird choices of close ups instead of widescreen ( Especially in a sequence that is supposed to be intense when another group is being executed behind a near hill ) which really create an awkward and unintentionally hilarious situation. This is not like a Leone film where the close ups are so immersive and involving due to it being an emotional and visual responder to when something is going to happen, but just an awkward piece of framing that becomes an unintentional hilarity. These are dumb characters with dumb dialogue standing still like a bunch of idiots while people are getting slaughtered. Close ups here do not emphasize the intensity, but only emphasize the ridiculousness of the situation. Not to mention there are many shots where certain people are simply not in frame. The rule of thirds is almost never used and it results in many unremarkable and ugly shots.The only positive about 'The Happening' is James Newton Howard's score, which was a superb emotional piece. Too bad for him it is wasted on such a terrible and forgettable film, although the unintentional hilariousness of it will still linger in a lot of minds.The Happening is a terrible film. Yet it is still a very likeable terrible film, because of its laughably unconvincing line deliveries and horrendous dialogue. Unfortunately Shyamalan was really going for the psychological terror approach here in the context of Hitchcock's The Birds and thus this does not really work out since the framing and the deliveries of these horrendous line make this more like a comedy than something that is supposed to be disturbing or scary, because both are nonexistent in this film.",2,0,1,21 October 2018
The Shape of Water," Typical 2017 political propaganda with little artistic value
","Not much else is new, yet another left wing propaganda film that focuses on its political message rather than actual artistic value which is what film should be about. It is an unfortunate turn of events after Guillermo del Toro seemed to be such a promising director after his masterpiece Pan's Labyrinth (2006).If nothing else, it is a very stylish and beautiful film. One of my complaints about a lot of modern movies is also the fact that most of them are ugly as can be, but this is not one of them. It is colorful, stylish and has beautiful cinematography. Yet i wish del Toro would try something else than the hip height camera stance and the constant moving around of the camera without having any kind of major reveal, it just makes it seem pointless. The score by Alexandre Desplat was also very good.Unfortunately all the good points end here. For a story about morals or a psychological intelligent kind of film we are obviously in the wrong place here. For one, lets analyze the main characters: A mute woman, a gay man, a black woman, and the evil white guy. Such an obvious lazy political message that has ruined filmmaking as it is today . We get that the white straight man is the enemy now, Hollywood, you might as well leave these kind of dumb messages out of your films, turning it into a bunch of socially pretentious garbage.It is a movie partly ruined by its irrelevant social message, yet the script and the dialogue also leave something to be desired. Conversations between the white bad guy and Hoyt borderline on the comical, that's how terrible they are. Lines like 'i do not fail' and 'i deliver', 'You are a God' also come off as extreme cringeworthy. The script goes too fast for the romance to feel anything like it isn't forced, which is exactly what it feels like now. The mute woman sees the captured animal and is somehow immediately in love because like her he cannot talk? Very convincing stuff. Unfortunately the entire romance is just another irrelevant political message ( mute woman and captured animal ) about the weak overcoming the strong. Regardless of whether or not you share these ideals, this is not what a movie should be about. But as a pure artistic milestone, del Toro fails on every aspect except cinematography.In the end what we have here is nothing new. Yet another modern film with the depth of a peanut and irrelevant political messages. A shame such a promising director has been downgraded to this.",3,5,12,29 April 2018
The Matrix Reloaded," Fails as a sequel, as an action flick, and as a psychological piece
","After the fantastic first film that was 'The Matrix', it is safe to say its sequels are simply money grabbing pieces of junk. The Matrix wasn't intended to have sequels, but due to the success of the first one it was unfortunately decided to create this incoherent pile of nonsense.Where did The Matrix Reloaded go wrong? First off, the fascinating concept behind 'The Matrix' is not so fascinating anymore since this sequel feeds on the same ideals, yet that kind of thing doesn't necessarily have to be a problem. ( Look at Terminator 2: Judgment Day for example as how a sequel should be ) But The Matrix Reloaded just comes across as a bunch of incoherent and pretentious nonsense because they wanted to build further on the original's ideas instead of the intelligent psychology that made the first one great. It is the kind of movie that tries to fool audiences in liking it so they can feel intellectually superior, which is something the original managed to avoid so well.Secondly, we have these terrible new characters like Niobe, Lock, Link, Link's girlfriend or something and that annoying kid that idolizes Neo which name i forget since he isn't memorable whatsoever. None of them seem to be able to act, and all of them have subplots devoid of any kind of emotional attachment to them since we first off barely know these characters due to their sudden appearance in this sequel, and the obvious fact that they cannot act ( especially that kid ). Smith has been changed to a prophet of some sort and seems to only be in this movie because of the success the first had. His character is really totally irrelevant otherwise.Third we have the obvious lazy CGI problem. Especially the scenes with Neo fighting the clones are just absolutely terrible. It uses a lot of CGI which was already dated at the time this was made and is comparable with a dumbed down weak fighting videogame. Especially the one where he pole dances around them horizontally, not sure who thought it was a good idea to put that shot in the film, but that person deserves to be fired, since it looks absolutely terrible. There is also simply put too much martial arts in it, like they wanted to impress audiences with their choreography instead of coherent storytelling yet use lazy CGI which basically ruins entire fighting scenes. The exception is the fight in the Chateau, which is one of the few pieces in this entire movie that was brilliantly filmed.Fourth we have Zion, the only human city left in the world which was mentioned a bit in the first Matrix. Yet every Zion scene is bleak, dead, dull, grey and lifeless. It has a lot to do with the characters there having the same characteristics, but the shots are ugly and the design behind the city is just terribly bleak all around. It does fortunately still have the stylish direction the first one had in scenes taking place inside The Matrix itself, and has a relatively interesting character with the Merovingian, yet it seems every little piece of strength this movie has has to come from the scenes in The Matrix, and even those suffer from terrible CGI and generally weak storytelling. There is also a character later on in the movie who basically destroys the concepts the first Matrix stood for ( stating anymore would be a spoiler ), so as a sequel it is also mediocre since it cannot follow up with an enhancement of the story, and instead overwriting it. It is both disrespectful to the original in this way, and pretentious in its own way of adding new concepts which make no sense after watching the first one.It is an unfortunate turn of events that these sequels were even created, as The Matrix was an amazing movie on its own. The smartest thing to do is to ignore the fact that The Matrix has become a trilogy and just keep watching the first one.",3,0,2,26 April 2018
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," A dark, tense & mysterious superior sequel
","While Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was more of a set up of its great world and many colorful characters, the Chambers of Secrets manages to expand further on its world with a more serious approach. The film is darker in tone and theme & its tension far outweighs the original.Visually the film is not as much obsessed with capturing this great fantasy universe that Harry Potter is set in, as much of that was already done wonderfully in the original film. Instead, Chamber of Secrets focuses on creating a fascinating mystery, which admittedly the first one also was, but the narrative structure in Chamber of Secrets is a bit more complex, with a lot of past events taken into account. I cannot stress enough how important John Williams's score is for these series, as they always seem to embody the feel the audience gets when watching it. In the Sorcerer's stone, we had a lot of joyous and adventurous themes, but in Chamber of Secrets most of the times quite an onimous and mysterious theme is used, which is also brilliantly composed by Williams as the music seems to tell a story in itself. Look at the scene where the chamber is finally opened for example. This scene is extremely memorable mostly due to Williams's fantastic orchestral score which captures the essence of the discovery perfectly.Normally i'm not a big fan of adding new characters to an existing new franchise as this, but Lucius Malfoy ( Jason Isaacs ) with the arrogant like back tilting of his head is very impressive as he embodies the over confidence of his character perfectly, & Gilderoy Lockhart ( Kenneth Branagh ) who is a great addition of a character that seems to have an ego that far exceeds his capabilities. Furthermore, the brilliant performances of Alan Rickman ( Snape ), Richard Harris ( Dumbledore ) & Maggie Smith ( Professor McGonagall ) return and have not diminished in the sequel. The three main leads Daniel Radcliffe ( Harry Potter ), Rupert Grint ( Ron Weasley ) & Emma Watson ( Hermione Granger ) are also admittedly growing in acting prowess although it is still the case the adults mostly steal the show with their acting at this point.It still does not deal directly with death as a theme, as its victims are petrified instead of killed by an unknown assailant, but this in turn creates a more mysterious feel to the film as we know everybody has the power to kill, but do not quite understand who has the power to petrify, which leads to the audience becoming fascinated in its mystery and the solving of it. It is not that the film gives the audience a clear view that the 'good guys' cannot be touched, since a real threat seems to be around every corner. The sheer teamwork between the tree main leads into solving this mystery and their great use of eachothers strengths and weaknesses furthermore enhances the emotional connection we have with them, and the final scene in which they are re-united with a certain friendly character is truly one of cinema's warmest moments, as it provides an over emotion of joy since our bonds with the characters have become so close over the first two films.The true star is its complex narrative structure, since its mystery is always evolving until the conclusion will leave you with emotions of self discovery and joy, as if we were really there in the moment due to the fact that the camaraderie between the characters seems to genuine.",8,0,0,23 June 2018
There Will Be Blood," Unconventional brilliance
","Paul Thomas Anderson is undoubtedly the greatest director of his generation, and There Will Be Blood once more shows his versatility as a director. Anderson's direction seems like a bit of a mix between Kubrick & Scorsese, and whereas a lot of earlier PT Anderson films seemed to lean more towards Scorsese ( Boogie Nights, Hard Eight ), There Will Be Blood leans more towards Kubrick, and feels unlike anything he has ever directed before.There Will Be Blood is kind of unconventional in its technical expertise. It uses a lot of angles one would never expect during certain scenes. An example of this is when Daniel Plainview ( Daniel-Day Lewis ) meets his half brother, in which most of the time the camera is behind Lewis, instead of using the more conventional shot/reverse shot method. Another example is when he reunites with his son H.W. after some time. Normally these scenes would feature mid/close up range to capture a more personal feel towards this event, but in There Will Be Blood this is changed into an obscure wideshot which is not satisfying at all while showing the pipeline in the foreground, like Anderson is visually telling the audience about what's more important to Plainview. These kind of techniques give this film a unique look and an odd kind of originality that is rarely found in films. It's pacing is reminiscent of Kubrick, but everything else seems to spring right from Anderson's artistic mind.There is no actual dialogue in the first fourteen minutes, and yet we learn so much about Plainview as a character. He is forced to crawl out of a well injured and alone for a single silver find which shows us visually just how destitute he is. His character arc is undoubtedly one of the greatest in cinematic history, as he evolves from this to the complete opposite while still maintaining a large degree of logic and sense. This is, in the end, a fantastic example of a brilliant study about the descent into madness due to greed and corruption.There are really no words that properly honor Daniel-Day Lewis's performance in this movie. He is absolutely superb. From his incredible imitation of a turn of the century voice to his charming speeches or facial expressions bursting with internal struggles, this is one of the finest protagonist performances ever to grace the big screen. Paul Dano ofcourse also shines in his two-way role of Paul & Eli Sunday, perfectly capturing the religious fanatic's personality. ( The time for him to shine is truly when he has to say he is a false prophet in the final scene, in which you can truly see the genuine struggle he is having by just looking at his expressions ). There are not many films out there that equal the quality of There Will Be Blood's acting due to this, and these powerhouse performances really transcend this already excellent film even further.It has a fantastic screenplay with a lot of exceptional dialogue. The final scene is a stand-out. That scene is absolute cinematic perfection in the intellect and sub text of its dialogue. The simple 'I'm finished' quote is still being debated to this day, as its meaning stretches far beyond what most can see. Some events like the arrival of Plainview's 'half brother' seem somewhat out of place and quite sudden, but we have to remember that this is Plainview's story and this sub plot works incredibly well as another pure elevator to hell for the sanity of his character.The cinematography is brilliant, with many beautiful images capturing that desolate and bleak look of the film perfectly. The drill fire sequence during night time is a perfect example of this, as the color of the fire lighting up the screen is contrasted beautifully by the silhouettes in the foreground. Most of the shots in the film are either slowly zooming in or zooming out, to capture that impending doom that always seems to be around every corner. Every frame, every shot, it all connects beautifully as it all has its own purpose. Not a single shot is wasted. The visual storytelling is very strong in There Will Be Blood, and it relies on the viewer's intelligence to understand this, as the respect P.T. Anderson shows here for his audience is very high. There are a lot of things one will need to figure out for themselves, because Anderson doesn't make his characters say blatant obvious things. However, this does not mean it is abstract or incoherent, because the visual story is still there for all to see.There Will Be Blood is titanically acted, intelligently written and most of all superbly directed by a master filmmaker. It is a haunting descent into madness, but it is in the unusual and unconventional way this is filmed that this really stands out as such a masterpiece.",9,2,3,5 October 2018
Parasite," A dumb bunch of Marxist propaganda
","Parasite, directed by Joon-Ho Bong, director of the excellent character study 'Memories of Murder' received an about 8 minutes long standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival. It also seems to be widely known now as a 'masterpiece', a term that flows easily these days. However, the truth is that it is simply a mediocrity, and the only reason this acclaim is received seems to be for the fact that it appeals to Marxist nut jobs because it deems poor people to be superior to rich people.Now, Bong doesn't depict our four protagonists as angels. On the contrary, they are scheming, immoral, disgusting, conniving, backstabbing low lifes, but the salient issue here is the fact that, especially in the later phases of the film, Bong wants the audience to feel pity for these four morons. Of course, our poor 'heroes' manage to scheme into a rich household in an extremely absurd & easy matter, made even easier by the gullible nature of the rich. Herein lies another problem. Standard human behavior is altered in order to fit Bong's sociological narrative, meaning that the rich man & woman are indeed too stupid to figure out anything, whereas a bunch of lazy criminal nut jobs who can't even fold a pizza box properly are genius in their scheming. It makes no logical sense, and suspension of disbelief can be a good thing, but not when it is made for a ham fisted social message. That's simply a lack of creativity in writing.There's also of course the far fetched plot points.. such as the secret door behind the bookcase. That nobody in the house has figured that out in four years is really something that stretches beyond suspension of disbelief, and the fact that someone was down there all the time is even dumber, not to mention the revelation near the end when the dad takes the guys's place. They're not exactly plot holes, but they are illogicalities that are another result of the very poor screenplay.In the technical aspects, Parasite doesn't disappoint as much, as the photography is adequate, coupled with an excellent score & generally good cinematography. Thus, it is alright to look at, but it is impossible to overlook the glaring holes in the substantial aspects. The acting is good for the most part, especially by the rich wife, who was however a completely idiotic and unbelievable hysterical character, further decreasing the subtleties between the depiction of the classes.In the end, Parasite was created as a depiction of class struggle, and while it does show the poor people as wicked creatures, Bong nonetheless deems it necessary with his narrative that we as an audience should care for them, even though they deserve every single evil they can get. We, as the audience, are supposed to judge based on class distinction which people are good and which people are bad, as opposed to something like character development, which generally is the more important thing.",5,14,29,28 November 2019
Paths of Glory," One of the all-time greats of anti-war motion pictures
","Paths of Glory is undoubtedly Stanley Kubrick's first truly great motion picture, and in turn cemented his talented potential in the motion picture industry. Ofcourse, he would later follow this up by directing at least six more films of superb quality, yet the typical Kubrick technical aspects are first visible in this particular picture.In a way, Paths of Glory is the most humane movie that Kubrick has ever made, and while certain trackingshots are very reminiscent of later projects such as The Shining (1980), this is still for Kubrick terms a very unconventional film. While one cannot deny Kubrick's genius as a director of angles, visuals, depth or artistic imagery, his films are generally emotionally quite disconnected since his character development is quite minimal, and the characters themselves one dimensional. ( Yeah, Alex DeLarge is an exception to this ) However, Paths of Glory is one of the most coherently structured films Kubrick has ever made, and doesn't have that 'weird-esque' feeling to it that later Kubrick films might have. It also has the strongest message about humanity and evil indifference, which in a way makes this Kubrick's most personally touching film by far, and the result is that it is without a doubt the most emotionally draining film he has ever made.Colonel Dax ( Kirk Douglas ) is the metaphor for the sole representation and hope of humanity, whereas every other high ranking officer symbolizes the evil and inhumanity of man. The picture does a tremendous job by showing the futility of war, and the corruption of those involved. The enemy is never shown, and battle sequences, while technically superbly filmed, are deliberately not very satisfying. This further symbolizes the fact that this is in the end about an army fighting itself, instead of an enemy, which ofcourse also emphasizes the ultimate uselessness of war. The only German that is shown ( The female singer in the final scene ) is depicted as an array of light and hope, instead of hate and anger as is usually associated with the enemy.The acting is generally superb, with in particular an outstanding performance by Kirk Douglas in the lead role, who truly seems to be the sole 'human' officer depicted in the film. The screenplay that is accompanied with this ( In particular later discussions between him and his superior officers ) is also fantastic, as the dialogue is intelligent and very relevant to this reflection of the human condition and the corruption thereof. There are a couple of short scenes in which the three future victims are introduced, and they are depicted as the average joe's who are quite comparable to nearly every other human being, and therefore their dilemma is even more emotionally compelling.In terms of technical aspects, Paths of Glory is also phenomenal. It is one of the best looking black-and-white movies ever made, which is a result of fantastic cinematography. The lighting in the jail sequences, the sideways tracking shots of the charge on the ant hill or the execution walk, every shot is close to perfection. Ofcourse the long trackingshots in the trenches also help enhance the situation our characters are in, and Kubrick's blocking in the officer scenes is fantastic, with many varieties in mood swings which are always emphasized by a character sitting down, standing up, or walking a certain direction. The dynamics in these exposition scenes are remarkable due to these varying visual hierarchies. One also has to mention the fantastic production design of the indoor sets featuring the high ranking officers, which definitely gives the audience this aristocratic kind of feeling that is in high contrast to the bleak trackingshots in the trenches featuring the normal soldiers.In the end, Paths of Glory is Kubrick's greatest personal effort, and among his greatest films. It is a genuinely human story under inhuman conditions, and with a final scene that is one of the greatest metaphorical and emotional sequences ever created in cinema, it is indeed one of the all-time greats in terms of anti war motion pictures.",9,0,1,2 December 2018
The Dark Knight Rises," Nolan saves the best for last
","The Dark Knight Rises is probably the greatest possible send off to the Dark Knight trilogy, as it manages to capture that complexity in its narrative like Batman Begins did, while not being severely muddled by chaotic views on morality Like the Dark Knight.As The Dark Knight had significant improvement over Batman Begins in terms of the action sequences, this is even more so evident in The Dark Knight Rises. This is finally a film where Nolan shows himself to be a competent action movie director. The flashyness of Batman Begins and the shakyness of The Dark Knight's fight scenes are now replaced with more simplistic and conventional camera angles. The ASL ( Average Shot Length ) in these action scenes seem to be a lot higher than in its previous entries, and the result is that in particular the fight sequences between Bane and Batman are a fascinating piece of brutal choreography where everything is now perfectly shown. It is obvious that at this point in the trilogy Chris Nolan has become self aware of his directional capabilities as far as action is concerned. He understands he isn't capable of directing these quick edited shaky fight sequences, and therefore does nothing special to the camera except heighten the ASL and let the actors's superb athleticism do their work. It is a great action film too in this regard.The cinematography is noticeable for being brighter than its two dark predecessors, yet the cinematography is still very good. It still manages to produce beautiful images, and despite that lack of utter darkness and hopelessness in its visuals, it still manages to capture an unsettling atmosphere. The original score by Hans Zimmer is once again obviously superb, even though a lot of it are recycled pieces from earlier on in the franchise. Acting quite possibly reaches its ultimate peak in The Dark Knight Rises, with in particular Michael Caine ( Alfred ) as a stand out. The genuine care Alfred seems to have about Bruce Wayne is something that is continued on throughout the film, and there are a couple of truly emotional outbursts that are as impactful as they are heartbreaking, which is all thanks solely to the superb performance by Michael Caine. The rest of the cast was good, although with very little other standouts. Bane ( Tom Hardy ) is a great villain but this is mostly because of his interesting character arc and apparent physical superiority. Tom Hardy doesn't have to go to many depths to portray the villain as well as he did because due to the mask on his face there is very little emotional depth possible. New characters like Selina Kyle ( Anne Hathaway ) & John Blake ( Joseph-Gordon Levitt ) are introduced and mostly adequately acted, but their characters are not particularly interesting in their development or persona in any way. The screenplay, unlike in The Dark Knight, does provide a couple of clever twists, which makes it retain the strong, intelligent and complex narrative structure of Batman Begins. However, Nolan does deem it necessary to put an over emphasis on exposition when these twists are revealed. We get a character spelling the events out for us combined with a flashback sequence which shows it to us, as if the audience wasn't clever enough to put two and two together. It would be fine if Nolan did one of the two here, which is either spelling it out without visuals or showing only the visuals for the twist ( preferably the latter ), but Nolan seemed to have little faith in his audience understanding his twist without the spoon fed and ham fisted exposition. In terms of emotional value and pure ecstatic quality there is no doubt that The Dark Knight Rises is the best in the trilogy. That pure feeling of achievement and triumph when Bruce Wayne makes a certain jump, or the impact of the death of a certain character, it is all as immersive as it can be because it does make you care about these things. Unfortunately it still seems to be the victim of a bunch of social commentary in the character of Selina Kyle. Be it crushing the hands of a tough inmate to beating up every men she can lay her hands on, her character is just a bunch of nonsensical feminism propaganda. A strong female character is not necessarily a bunch of social commentary, but when about five seperate seemingly irrelevant scenes about her beating up a bunch of guys are shown, this really shows Nolan is spelling out for us: 'Look at this film, we are so original by showing a puny female beat up bunches of men! This is going to sell great to the uninitiated and the SJW's!'. It is really an unfortunate turn of events for a film that could have been even greater.The Dark Knight Rises consists of excellent action sequences, superb cinematography and acting, a smart script & a lot of character development, but it unfortunately also features a lot of unnecessary exposition and irrelevant social propaganda, which decreases the intellect of the overall product severely. Still, it is the best entry in the series due to the fact that it is superior in most of the primary aspects.",8,0,3,14 October 2018
Black Panther," A ridiculous mess of hero villain clichés, cringy dialogue and political correctness
","The entire concept of 'Black Panther' with a third world country that is supposedly technologically advanced is, ofcourse, utterly ridiculous. This means this movie was probably doomed to fail from the start, yet the mess it has turned out to be is just an affront to cinema in general. There are a lot of problems with this big pile of garbage, and naming all of them isn't really possible in a single review, so let us pick out the most obvious ones. The general core in a film is its story and storytelling abilities, combined with compelling characters and character development. All of these things Black Panther has failed terribly at. It is a terrible and nonsensical plot about this country in Africa being a technologically advanced nation, yet they still fight for the crown of king like a bunch of barbarians? A plot can transcend realism factors with its story, but it cannot transcend ridiculousness, which is what this movie has done. This in turn makes it empty, with no characters to care about and no story to care about, because it is such an absolutely ridiculous bunch of nonsense it isn't possible to relate to. As if it couldn't be any worse the plot is incredibly predictable. A certain person appears to die but you know he didn't. A certain person is a mysterious outsider but you know who he is already. The villain can also kill the hero but prefers first to speak a few words so someone can save him.Unfortunately even though the movie itself is terrible, it is also covered in a SJW political kind of cover. There are a lot of messages that one needs to help the entire world, and all of the women guards ( What a joke ) fighting like they have some kind of superpowers is just tiresome feministic ridiculousness once again. It is just laughable that the supposed greatest 'warrior' and general of wakanda is a woman, it makes you think about what kind of wimps the men are like there. Nonsensical feministic message once again. If the art form that is film has turned into this kind of social propaganda, there is little feature left. Bunch of nonsense to keep the feminists and social justice warriors happy is all the message is here, no morals and no psychology.The actors unfortunately also leave much to be desired. Everybody has this weird african accent that makes it look like they can barely pull a bucket out of a well yet we are supposed to believe this nation is technologically superior, just a joke. This is excluding the villain ( Michael B. Jordan ) in the film who is even worse as he talks like some idiot straight out some hood in the Bronx and combines this with his weird head uptilts and gestures and 'Bro' dialogue that is as out of character as can be if we want to take this idiot seriously. The movie did start out with a decent villain in the form of Andy Serkis, but he was unfortunately replaced halfway through by this idiot. Not to mention the weird cringy facial expressions especially the woman warrior makes all the time.We once again have cheap CGI as an excuse for nice cinematography, but it just looks bloated and ugly and not at all authentic, as it will always be. Greenscreen cannot possibly replace the seduction of natural lighting in actual beautiful environments, and it is also the reason this movie just looks ugly. The fight scenes feature terrible choreography with superhuman jumping and weird moves which you might have seen a lot in a couple of terrible videogames. It also includes a scene in which the villain and hero fight in midair, reminiscent of the absolutely terrible fight between Neo and Smith in Matrix Revolutions, but this one is just as bad. You can tell all of the fighting and the moveset is just pure CGI, there are no impressive athletic skills, just videogame jumping around nonsense. There are also a couple of scenes near the end which are stolen straight out of Return of the King and Star Wars, as if this already mindless project ran out of further ideas.With terrible actors, terrible acting, terrible cliché dialogue ( Especially by our forced delivery cliché fest master Michael B. Jordan ), irrelevant political messages, ugly cinematography, ugly choreography & mediocre modern day music Black Panther isn't just bad, it is indeed, a disaster for whom i can name no good points.",1,13,27,5 May 2018
Ben-Hur," The penultimate epic, one of the all-time greats, rich in both scale & scope
","The general problem that a lot of epics have is that behind all their technical expertise and spectacular scenery, the human drama sometimes gets lost under the visuals. This is not the case for Ben-Hur, one of the most splendid of all epics and long productions, as it succeeds on both of these points.One thing one could always expect in an epic such as this is indeed the grand visual splendor, and not only does Ben-Hur deliver in that regard, it outperforms most of the similar themed movies such as Quo Vadis or King of Kings most splendidly. It is longer, greater, and the sets are simply even more beautiful. A couple of objects in certain sets are drawn in artificially, but it nevertheless looks absolutely gorgeous. In particular the set for the chariot race boggles the mind. Not even keeping in mind how filming such gargantuan sets was even possible in 1959, it's even more so impressive today in an era of plastic made scenery. The production is simply bigger in scale & generally more beautiful than nearly every single picture that has ever been made ( It's in the top 10, at least ).The costume design is beautiful, the cinematography impeccable, and the widescreen shots of hundreds of people marching across the screen in David Lean fashion is also a sight to behold. The sound is generally outstanding, except for a couple of obvious post-production additions, which sounds a bit off, but that really is something of minor significance in the grand scheme of things. Of course, Ben-Hur also features quite possibly the greatest action sequence of all-time, the chariot race. As stated before, the production for this sequence is already beyond comprehension, but to add such a superbly edited and performed action sequence to it really is quite remarkable. There was this particular stunt in which a stuntman drives over a crashes chariot, being launched into the air before just gripping on, which could have easily resulted in death. It's an impeccable action sequence for both this extraordinarily committed stuntwork & the tight editing.One also cannot forget Miklos Rozsa's incredible contribution to this picture by providing one of cinema's greatest scores. Nearly a symphony of epic proportions, it creates some of the greatest tearjerking moments in cinema. Of course, this is also partly due to the film itself, but themes like the love theme or the Star of Bethlehem are nearly unparalleled in cinema, truly creating that feeling of literal magic on the screen, coupled with excellent action oriented themes such as Parade of the Charioteers & Rowing of the Galley Slaves. The score is undoubtedly one of the most emotionally superb scores of all-time.Even though few to no epics score as good in this regard as Ben-Hur, most are still very solid in the aspects named above. But what truly makes Ben-Hur stand out from most of them is the essential core upon which it drives; its genuine human drama. This is not just a spectacle of sound & visuals, it is also the very human story of the gradual redemption of our main character, Judah. The subplots of Jesus Christ aren't just added for the sake of it, but it signifies his final deliverance from the hatred tearing his heart apart. Jesus is symbolized as a reminder against despair, as is so beautifully shown in the scene where he gives Judah water, which is essentially what keeps him alive not only physically, but mentally as well. It renews his will to live. It is heartbreaking to see the injustice done to Judah and his family, and watch him struggle with this loss internally for the rest of the entire movie, yet in the end he finds his redemption and is rewarded for it.Charlton Heston is the perfect actor for the role of such a biblical epic, as he has proven before in the Ten Commandments, and his nemesis Stephen Boyd as the evil Messala is perhaps even more impressive. His death scene is definitely one of the greatest death scenes in all of cinema. How you could so greatly display such pain and agony and incoming death in an acting performance is quite extraordinary. Their friendship and betrayal seems to affect the heart even more so due to these excellent performances, especially the argument in Judah's house being a superbly acted scene. Esther, played by Haya Harareet, an Israëli actress, is also splendidly affectionate as the true driving power behind the redemption of Judah's soul, even though her odd accent sometimes distracts a litte bit.Ben Hur is thus grandiose in both scale and scope, internally and externally, visually and substantially, in nearly every aspect of its being. It is beautiful to look at, heartbreaking to witness and especially fulfilling to both the mind and heart of the audience. There's little doubt of its status among cinema's all-time greats.",9,0,1,10 November 2019
The Deer Hunter," Heartbreaking story about the personal consequences the Vietnam war has on a group of friends
","The Deer Hunter is not the typical moral confliction of soldiers in war kind of motion picture but one that instead focuses on the consequences the war has for people that have participated in it, and for the people related to them.It is a character picture, focusing on its vast group of characters as its main focus. We get to know all of the main characters ( and the three of them that leave for Vietnam ) in a lengthy opening hour of the movie so we can relate to them better when the scenes in Vietnam do occur. It is a movie divided into three parts: The pre-Vietnam phase in which one of the three protagonists leaving for Vietnam gets married, which also features a very large wedding scene. The scenes in Vietnam themselves & the post-Vietnam phase. Obviously the whole point of this film is the last hour of the movie, but this would not be as powerful or emotionally rich without the first two parts in which we see what the characters are like and ( by the time they reach Vietnam ) can relate to them and root for them to escape with their lives. The acting for all of the main characters is absolute world class, with Cristopher Walken seemingly the greatest of them all. While the characters might not always seem likeable, they are portrayed realistically and their friendship feels genuine due to this.The musical score by Stanley Myers captures the emotional intensity of the movie perfectly due to its peaceful bittersweet kind of sound which fits just right into the theme of the movie about friends trying to reconnect with eachother after a series of brutal events.The cinematography is beautiful, especially the scenes with Michael ( Robert de Niro ) deer hunting in the mountains are just visually incredible due to their gorgeous backdrop mountain shots. Tension is only something that is build up for the Vietnam scenes, but this is done beautifully in the form of Russian roulette games that feature exceptional acting by de Niro whose electrifying presence further heightens the tension.The final part of the movie where one of the protagonists tries to reconnect with his former life and friends is ofcourse where it really shines. It accurately shows the consequences of the dehumanizating nature of war and how the lives of the participants and their relatives are affected by it, often resulting in heartbreaking scenes.Unfortunately there does seem to be an abundance of constant background sounds or indistinguishable dialogue that makes it quite hard to follow what is going on, and that the scenes seem to jump a bit too quickly from one place to another ( probably due to its already long running time, but still ). Yet these things are not so noticeable that they significantly lessen the cinematic experience.It is an emotionally rich statement about how war affects us all in a negative way, and by showing us the first hour of pre-war character development, Michael Cimino allows us to see the changes this causes to ( especially ) our three protagonists who have left for Vietnam.",8,1,3,1 May 2018
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A very worthy farewell
","It seems that after the pure filler that was Deathly Hallows: Part 1, David Yates finally seems to get down to business in Part 2. Whereas indeed nothing happened in Part 1, Part 2 provides a wide range of narrative, revelations & emotional outbursts.Like in Part 1, the cinematography is top notch, although it is more of a lightshow this time around, as it shows the full scale war of Hogwarts in a visually impressive fashion. It is however not one of these productions that becomes lazy in its visuals due to modern technology, as every shot and every angle seems carefully planned out and the CGI is handled with utmost care resulting in stunning visuals. ( Except perhaps the broom escape from the room of requirement scene, which looked pretty bad ) The score by Alexandre Desplat is also excellent, and while he is not John Williams, it uses a fair bit of nostalgic scenes in which Williams's themes from the first film make a long awaited return, and since nostalgia is ofcourse such a powerful emotion ( Atleast when it reminds us of great things, such as the first couple of Harry Potter films ) this should provide the audience with a very 'satisfying' feeling, which is also primarily what makes this such a good finale.The most fascinating part for me was the revelation of Snape's intentions and his changed depiction from villain into a hero. When we watch the pensive sequence, everything that has happened before makes sense, and this will leave you all the more sad about the fact that ever since the Sorcerer's Stone Snape has mostly always been seen as the villain of the story, and his true intentions are only shown at the end, when it is too late for him. There is no doubt that the pensive sequence is the greatest scene in the film, as its sheer emotional power & the incredible character transformation will leave you in awe for a long time afterwards. I was quite worried that since Part 2 relies on loads of action sequences that these sequences would look the same as they did in Part 1. ( That is, loads of shakycam and quick cutting so you never see what is going on ) Fortunately Yates seems to have learned from his mistakes and as a result Part 2 features great action sequences with fantastic angles and subtle camera movements, instead of the shakycam nonsense the first one had.On the contrary to Part 1, Part 2's narrative instead DOES seem to be going somewhere, as there are less overly melodramatic scenes and more plot-driven ones. It might be shorter, but loads more Horcruxes are destroyed in Part 2 as compared to 1, while in the meantime we witness Voldemort's assault on Hogwarts, which creates a 'race against time' kind of picture in which the tension and immersion is fantastic, since pretty much every likeable character still alive from previous films joins in the fight, and since there are so many likeable characters in the franchise you genuinely care about their fates. Harry's melancholy stroll through the hospital which shows the death of long time characters such as Fred Weasley & Lupin really tug at the heartstrings since we have grown to like them so much over the previous films, and it definitely results in you becoming immersed in the moment, as you know Harry Potter is no longer the fairytale it once was, and in contrast to the first few films shows that its world is not a perfect place and that the good guys can die too. It also features the by far best performance in the series of Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, who finally seems to truly capture the essence of the feelings of his character perfectly. The camaraderie between Ron, Harry & Hermione might have been terrible in Part 1, but they once again grow closer to eachother in Part 2 and coupled with the many nostalgic sub texts to its previous films their character bonding once again seems genuine.However, i won't state that it couldn't end any better than this, as it does have some slight negatives. It should have obviously been longer, since running at 2 hours and 10 minutes it is the shortest of all Harry Potter films, and this seems a bit underwhelming when you know that this is the one where everything is going to end, which in turn results in the picture sometimes being slightly too hasty. Voldemort's death was extremely anti-climactic, as in the end he easily kills himself with a backfired curse because the elder wand never belonged to him. While a lot of Harry's clashes with Voldemort are brilliantly filmed, with a lot of slow motion added to it to increase the tension to a fantastic degree, the way he meets his demise in the end is not as satisfying as it could have been.This all results in a final installment that features excellent action sequences, impressive visuals due to outstanding cinematography and a great use of CGI ( which was for once not lazy ), many nostalgic references to invoke emotions in the lifelong audience, genuine interest in all of the character's fates, the definitive Radcliffe performance, and save for Voldemort's death, a very satisfying experience which results in it being one of the best entries to the HP series ( Prisoner of Azkaban is still objectively better, but it would rank second. )",8,1,1,29 June 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The ultimate testament to the goodness in humanity
","The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is not just a movie, it is a beacon of hope, an array of light, if you will. In more concrete terms, it is quite possibly the greatest film ever made, out of the greatest trilogy ever made.The Return of the King defines the 'magic' of the motion picture arts like no other. This kind of picture is the reason why we watch movies. The emotions going through you as you are experiencing this utter piece of art are quite indescribable, and need to be witnessed first hand. Peter Jackson has created a monument, to be standing tall for years to come, as a motivational piece for humanity.Since there are no new characters that need to be introduced in Return of the King ( Except for Denethor if you haven't watched the extended edition of The Two Towers ), Return of the King focuses solely on Sauron's attempted destruction of Middle-Earth. This is not, however, a weakness, because the character arcs of characters like Pippin, Sam & Aragorn are being developed more than ever in this last entry of the trilogy, resulting in great character changes due to drastic events.The acting is, like the entire trilogy, once again near flawless. Sean Astin & Elijah Wood as Sam & Frodo in particular stand out, while the corruption of the Ring tightens its grip around Frodo, with Sam always being there to save him from it. It is a friendship so real, of which the likes is rarely ever depicted on screen, at least not on this level. The make-up on both hobbits truly makes it look like they have crawled through barren wastelands for months on end, and Sam's melancholy references to the Shire, a forgotten period it seems, are truly as poignant as they come. There is a constant sense of hopelessness in what they are trying to do, but they kept on going anyway, due to an iron will of sorts. It is really this mentality that moves large portions of audiences.The screenplay is ofcourse once again phenomenal. There are many different storylines & character arcs, and to be invested in all of them is truly top notch filmmaking. As i've stated in reviews of the previous films, this is probably also due to Tolkien's superb literature, but the dialogue, the character arcs, it is all perfection. As stated before, in particular Sam's motivational speeches to Frodo are literary masterful, as are the pre-battle speeches of Theoden and Aragorn.One is too short on words to properly compliment Howard Shore's incredible work on this trilogy. The diversity of his score, his use of leitmotifs, the raw emotional power, this is definitely and undisputably one of the greatest scores ever created for motion pictures. It is weird to image the LOTR films without his iconic score, which, for a very large portion, added extreme layers of emotional intensity to this picture.Like the previous entries, Return of the King is once again aesthetically pleasing. There are a couple of sets that might have been average looking, but when you look at the technical marvel of a set that Minas Tirith was, these minor shortcomings can easily be neglected. The shot of Gandalf ascending this titanic city while Shore's score plays is just one of the many examples of the goosebump and emotion inducing ride that Return of the King is. The final shots of Frodo & Sam lying on a rock on mount doom are also some examples of visual beauty.With everything that has happened, and with the constant sense of hopelessness hanging in the air in this particular picture, this whole fictional world truly does seem to be at risk, and there is rarely a film that makes one so firmly root for its protagonist like this one manages to. When Aragorn & Theoden charge after their respective speeches, you wish as you were charging with them, and actually feel like you are doing so. These are some of the most likeable, well developed and complex heroes ever created, and it is sad to leave them for a time ( At least until the next viewing... ). The battle at the black gate, intertwined with Frodo, Sam & Gollum's struggle for the ring, are another marvel of tension filled filmmaking. The slow motion usage in the battle is not there to look 'cool', but to draw out tension and emotion in the audience. The battle sounds fade, and only Shore's melancholy score plays, as if certain characters were meeting their doom in this battle. The fantastic close ups of the facial expressions of our heroes after Sauron is annihilated is of course also a phenomenal kind of acting.The many ending sequences are sometimes falsely criticized, since one has to keep in mind that we have witnessed a life changing story for our characters, and Frodo's inability to cope with a coming back to his previous and normal life further adds another layer to the complexity and the humane message of this film. The coronation, and the setting out for the Grey Havens also result in one of the both most satisfying & sad movie endings ever created. Furthermore, it is the kind of picture that should have no loose ends lying around, as every single character was set up to be something in the end, which is what has happened.The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is capable of invoking emotions in audience that are never felt during any other film ever made. It is a genuinely humanist story about hope, brotherhood, friendship, and seeing the good in humanity despite all of its corruption and death. This is ofcourse all very resonant to the real world. Featuring great acting, character development, writing, cinematography & a phenomenal original score, Return of the King is a state of mind instead of a film, and my personal pick for the 'Greatest of all-time'.",10,1,3,24 December 2018
The Matrix," An excellent combination of style and psychology
","The Matrix is the kind of movie that easily could have been absolutely terrible, as it has been compared to a lot of incoherent nonsense and some stating that it is a hard to understand or mindbreaking film. However, this is not the case. In contrast to a lot of these incoherent films that appear intelligent to make people like them so THEY can feel intelligent too, The Matrix is actually a well thought out psychological motion picture about living in denial and being aware.What makes The Matrix stand out as such a great film is that while the story is obviously far-fetched, it manages to capture a very close relevance to the actual world. In the film the choice is given to live in denial or know the truth, which is very relevant to people in modern society. It understands human emotions and embraces it, instead of quite simply just ignoring it like a lot of todays movies seem to do.I am not a very big fan of Keanu Reeves, who appears to be a wooden plank in most of his roles, and it is also the case in this movie, yet it does not detract the film from being any less despite him being the main character. Perhaps his constant confused look seems to somehow fit just right in this movie, i am not sure. But somehow Keanu Reeves just fits in Neo properly. Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus, Joe Pantoliano as Cypher ( who is by the way a brilliant addition of a typical character who WANTS to live in denial and escapism, and doesnt want to see the truth ) & Hugo Weaving as the deep layered computer program Agent Smith are the most notable and best of the supporting cast, as each gives off an excellent performance. It is also a beautifully stylishly shot, choreographed & edited film. The movie has many great shots, filmed with a green tint in the scenes in The Matrix. Ofcourse the one where Neo steps in Trinity, Apoc & Switch's car comes to mind, with a fantastic distance shot when he finally steps in which shows the downpour of the rain combined with the green tint. There is also a lot of martial arts, and all this is filmed brilliantly. There is no shakycam, no quick edits, just raw athleticism and power, leaving you in awe every time a hand to hand fight comes on the screen. The Wachowski brothers also frequently used slow motion, particularly in an amazingly edited and choreographed lobby shootout. You do not miss a thing of what is happening on screen due to this excellent camera technique. The slow motion enhances the overview of the entire shootout. Not to mention the trademark visually breakthrough impressive bullet dodges Neo makes later on in the film.This all means The Matrix is excellent entertainment, one of the greatest pure action movies, but also challenges us to understand the truth about the world we are living in.",9,0,0,18 April 2018
300," Messy, ugly & ultimately pointless
","While 300's concept of the famous historical final stand of the greeks against the Persians might be an interesting premise, the actual cinematic quality of the picture itself is quite low.It is admirable how the film approaches masculinity in this modern age, because its main characters ( Especially Leonidas ) are not to be trifled with and are shown to be nobody's plaything. However, the constant shots of these precisely trained sixpack abs starts to become quite ridiculous, as if we were watching a couple of fitness freaks hit the gym instead of acting in a movie. There is no real story or character development, and we are not even given a backstory about the Greeks & the Persians and why they are enemies or what they stand for, other than that Xerxes is a 'Tyrant', but that cliché is just lazy writing. Leonidas decides to march against the thousands of Persians with just 300 men, and no real reason is given for this weird course of action.While Gerard Butler is somewhat charismatic, he is completely miscast as Leonidas, as his mannerisms are seemingly much too modern. Take his first conversation with Xerxes for example, and his weird 'Unable to knee' excuse. Michael Fassbender and David Wenham are also great actors in the cast, but are not given the chance to shine due to the fact that this movie doesn't seem to have a plot.The cinematographer, Larry Fong, creates this weird grainy kind of visual look for the picture, and constantly uses artificial backdrops and artificial lighting in order to visualize his scenes. His cinematography doesn't use color variation. It is just one bland mess of white, grey & black, which makes me wonder why it is filmed in color at all, because it isn't being used. It's obvious it is a poor attempt at being original, but every shot is just so ugly and artificial that it becomes a poor joke to look at, and this is not just the case in a single scene but in EVERY SINGLE ONE. Even one indoor scene with Leonidas's wife being accused of something by Theron has the weirdest and unnatural kind of lighting ever seen in film. The result is the visuals of this film are extremely artificial, plastic & fake looking, and nowhere in the picture does this make me believe that what is happening here feels like an actual world. Instead, it feels mostly cartoonish in its visuals.There is no character development to speak of, since every character remains the same. I don't think there is a single character that has clearly defined characteristics other than most of the male's masculinity, so there is really no one to care about, since we know nothing of the characters and since we are not given the feeling that they could be real. Snyder's direction is highly stylized but once again has little substance in the end. Slow motion is generally a great tool to use in creating suspense before something happens or as a kind of 'Reflection' for a character so we can better sense their inner struggles at a certain point. However, the use of slow motion in 300 is completely pointless, as it is used in the battles themselves in an on and off kind of way, which no doubt looks very 'cool' to most milennials, but in the end does not serve a purpose. There is a lot of blood in these scenes, most of which looks extremely fake and cartoon like.Ultimately this means that 300 is a mess. There is no character development, no lore or backstory, no real narrative structure, poor writing with mostly mediocre dialogue, actors who are not used to the best of their abilities, no morality or metaphors, and all the while this is accompanied by the most abyssmal looking artificial cinematography, as if we were watching some kind of kids cartoon.",3,2,9,19 July 2018
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," A slight improvement over the first two, but still pretty bad
","Ofcourse it is no secret that The Twilight Saga is not one of cinema's finest forthbringings, as its first two films are some of the worst examples of acting/writing you will ever see, and while Eclipse might not be much better, atleast the unintentional comedy finally seems kept to a minimum this time. ( Yes, there are still unintentionally comically bad moments, but not so many as previous ones )The main reason that this one still towers over its terrible predecessors is because of the fact that we are actually given some insight to backstories of some of the Cullen's, such as that story about one of them being a confederate soldier or the one by that blonde Cullen woman ( I forget a lot of the Cullen's names as their characters were not very memorable ). The cinematography is a bit better than its predecessors too, yet we can still notice a lot of actual wideshots ( Such as the one in the mountains ) was greenscreened and therefore didn't quite look as great as it would have like to have been. Tension is a bit better than in the previous ones too with the story about the newborn army, but since this is kind of like a kids franchise we know none of the good guys are probably going to get hurt, and if they do, why should we even care? The people displayed here do not talk and act like actual people, and therefore an emotional connection cannot be made. The love triangle between Bella, Edward & Jacob is starting to become ridiculous. Ofcourse, i don't quite understand what anyone could see in Bella who always has just one facial expression, but Jacob's & Edward's fighting over her borderline on the comical. Seriously, who would fight over a inhuman emotionless dead inside kind of girl like Bella? The screenplay might be a little bit better, but still it mostly consists of your typical Twilight conversations like: 'You love him', 'I love you more', yeah these types of clichés are what your general Twilight screenplay consists of most of the time. It might have less unintional comedy, but let us not forget the AMAZING scene with Bella and her father when she admits she is a virgin. The sheer inhuman and unnatural acting by Kristen Stewart will make you laugh out loud at this point, but at least it was kept to a minimum this time.The acting by the three main characters is once again terrible. I reckon even if you get these actors to play on a film with an actual good script, they will still blow it with their delivery. Lautner might be slightly better than Pattinson and Pattinson slightly better than Stewart, but all three of them have non existent acting talents. It baffles me that especially Stewart is still somehow getting work, whose constant sighing makes it look like she is extremely nervous everytime she has to film a scene. I mean, i get that David Fincher cast her in Panic Room as the spoiled annoying little brat because she wasn't known at the time, but people who still cast her should know better. There is just no argument you can give in her favor when it comes down to acting. The sighing, hair touching, head shaking, eye contact evasing, open mouthing, deadened line deliveries & the list goes on. Like a robot sent from Mars to act on Earth, that is really what her style comes down to.While it is a bit better than its predecessors due to the fact that it had a couple of backstories which took the focus off Bella ( Who is a TERRIBLE character ), it is still a Twilight film featuring Kristen Stewart & Robert Pattinson, and this alone still makes sure it is a mediocre mess.",3,0,0,17 June 2018
Braveheart," Powerful, emotional, epic, sensational story about what it means to be free
","An incredible motion picture, Braveheart is a sensational masterpiece and one of the greatest movies ever put to screen. It is a feast of color, motion, sound and emotion which delivers one of the greatest cinematic experiences one could ever hope to get.The first hour of the film is pretty much the ultimate cinematic experience. We witness brutality, tragedy, love, redemption, revenge and much more in the course over just the first hour. The rest of the movie is equally great, but i would pick the first hour as the ultimate cinematic experience. The small romantic part of the story between Wallace and his secret bride is quite short yet so convincing due to James Horner's incredible emotionally rich musical score or the little things such as him returning the flower she gave him as a child or the genuine and natural looks they give eachother without speaking that it makes it all the more emotional and powerful when his wife does eventually meet a terrible fate.The acting is of top notch quality. Particularly Patrick McGoohan is extremely convincing as the ruthless King Edward Longshanks and Angus Macfadyen as Robert the Bruce caught between his own conscience while trying to pick the right side and make the right decisions. Gibson, Gleeson & O'Hara are also extremely convincing as the three leading men of the scottish army.Yet what really makes Braveheart the movie into what it is is Gibson's character Wallace and his ideology for a free Scotland and his incapability of stopping until it is achieved. This is combined with excellent dialogue such as the speech before the battle of Stirling which makes his character the ultimate well developed idealist instead of a generic hero type. It is a powerful statement about freedom and what we are prepared to do in order to achieve it. Some critics critize the lack of historical accuracy in Braveheart, which is mostly correct. However, these critics do not realize that film is a cinematic experience, and should not be judged by factors that have little to do with the actual cinematic experience. What Mel Gibson created here is an epic emotional journey that lives and breathes due to romanticizing history into fiction which only strengthened the movie itself. Battle sequences are incredibly filmed. The cinematography is already great in Braveheart with many extraordinary sweeping landscape shots of the green planes of Scotland but in the battle of Stirling this reaches its quality climax. The widescreen shots of the entire English army with the trees in the background are just breath taking visual beauty that is a delight to the eyes. You can tell Gibson took inspiration from Akira Kurosawa's style ( creating epic widescreen shots with constant movement ) and in this particular scene especially Ran (1985) seems to have been a major influence. The battle sequences are always shot in a way that you can understand what is going on and how the battle is playing out, and the violence is realistic and brutal, as is the movie. Also admirable is Gibson's incredible use of slow motion or long drawn out rides of horses or men to build up tension to a point where we are sitting on the edge of our seat. It is a movie full of extremely well build tension, which is lacking in most films today.With great dialogue, acting, cinematography, incredible music, tension, emotional value & many beautiful shots what Mel Gibson has achieved here is an absolute masterpiece of the historical epic genre.",9,1,4,30 April 2018
Gladiator," Gigantic in scale, rich in substance & also one of the most emotionally draining movies ever made
","Gladiator is not just director Ridley Scott's ultimate masterpiece ( And i am also keeping the fantastic Alien & Blade Runner in mind when i say this ), it is also undoubtedly one of the most viscerally effective and emotionally compelling of motion pictures ever made.It plays somewhat like a modern Ben-Hur, as a very respectable character is forced into slavery due to him standing up for what is right. Of course, being a much more modern epic, the editing is a lot quicker, as is the entire pace of the picture. However,with 171 minutes playtime in the extended edition, Scott doesn't haste through this picture, and takes his time to set up his characters & their respective arcs. Gladiator is however not a flawless film, as several action sequences ( Particularly in the introduction in the battle of Germania ) feature quite a lot of shaky cam and quick editing, but admittedly this is nowhere near as bad as something like Taken or The Bourne Trilogy. Most of the action sequences are superbly edited, with widescreen shots to create an overview, combined with mediums to immerse the viewer into the action. A couple of times there is a shakycam shot in the middle of this, but it's a very minor issue. Another minor fault is in some of the backdrops. The 'Am i not merciful' scene features an obvious greenscreen, saturated a bit too brightly, and Proximo is obviously not physically there near the end of the film ( When actor Oliver Reed had already died ). Again these minor issues feature only in 1 scene respectively, and therefore do not really do anything to truly diminish the cinematic power that Gladiator provides.On the whole, the cinematography & art direction of Gladiator is impeccable. It is not the best, since as stated before there are a couple of lesser backdrops easily recognizable as greenscreens, but for most of the picture the viewer is subjected to beautiful angles, backdrops & sets. The scenes in Zuccabar are an example of the seductive natural beauty Gladiator provides, and Maximus's ride to his family after his execution attempt also feature some stunning environmental shots. Sets are elegantly crafted and varied in a beautiful color palette, becoming most apparent in Commodus's & Lucilla's scenes. The titanic image of the Colosseum is also one that is difficult to get rid of, despite the fact that i believe it was filmed in full CGI, but apart from perhaps the absolute final shot ( Burying the sculptures ), that is hardly noticable.The art of acting is utilized at its finest in Gladiator, with three absolute superb performances by leads Russel Crowe as Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus & Connie Nielsen as Lucilla. Not to mention the fantastic supporting performances of legendary actor Richard Harris & Oliver Reed. Crowe is the epitome of a brick of stoic masculinity, yet he gave an utterly convincing and extended sob fest when gazing upon the sight of his crucified family, showing us his versatility as an actor. We see him win a battle against Germanians through his discipline, intelligence and courage, and we are rooting for his character from this moment forth. He is in his heart a simple man that just wants to go home to his family, but he is also honor bound to Rome, and proves this through his courageous actions. Not interested by the corruptions of power, he lives only to see justice done. Phoenix is superb as the corrupted emperor, showing us his envy of Maximus simply with one look into the eyes ( Look at Phoenix's superb facial acting in the scene where Maximus reveals himself to him in the arena ), his arrogance & his brutality. Nielsen is also quite underrated, as her disguised fear during every scene with her brother after their father's death is a stunning feat of acting within acting, culminating with her utter terror at the end when Commodus demands a 'pure blood' heir with her.Of course one cannot forget Hans Zimmer's fantastic contribution to his masterpiece, creating arguably his finest score to date, with this especially being the case during the transition between the (Again) 'Am i not merciful' scene and the shots of the arena. Obviously 'Now we are free' is also one of the most emotionally powerful scores ever created. It is also one of Zimmer's most varied scores, as a slight criticism of him is often his repeated melodies ( Admittedly, a lot of the themes in Gladiator still sound similar to The Rock, but a lot of them also do not ). In any case, it is rare to imagine the brilliance and emotional resonance of Gladiator without Zimmer's score.While the narrative is fairly straightforward as a revenge story, the dialogue written is superb, with many incredible lines such as 'What we do in life, echoes in eternity', not to mention the slow character development and character arcs, even within seemingly minor characters like Proximo & Quintus ( You will need to see the extended edition to witness Quintus's arc ) who have their original ideals challenged and overcome throughout the events in the film. Even though Maximus's sole purpose in life has become to kill Commodus in revenge for his family, it is in a way a very hopeful film. A film about standing up for what is right, and being granted redemption and a reunion with loved ones in the end. Maximus does not want to rule Rome, but in slaying Commodus, he secures the feature of it for is people, while also acquiring his personal goal. He demands respect for his valor and his morals throughout the film, and this makes sure that we as an audience are emotionally drained by the time he enters the Elysium fields, and is hailed as a hero by the people of Rome, and a hero he was.One of the all-time greats of epic motion pictures, Gladiator features impeccable acting, writing ,cinematography, art direction & a phenomenal original score. It also features possibly the most relatable main character ever written, which is partly why there are very little films that can equal the emotional power that Gladiator creates.",10,9,11,21 April 2019
Goodfellas," A phenomenal view inside the mob lifestyle
","Few movies purely about the life in the mob can truly capture perfection as Goodfellas manages to do so well. It has less sugarcoating compared to the more tame and inaccurate The Godfather ( Which is inferior to Goodfellas objectively speaking. ) and it has more brutality and realism. The movie starts off with a flashback to a later scene in which a certain character is beat up, dumped into the back of a car and driven to a spot to be buried by the three main protagonists. However, when the movie starts all the audience hears is a thud, we don't know what is happening yet. As everybody gets out of the car they find this character is not dead yet, and continue to respectively stab and shoot this person to death in cold blood. After which, the iconic line 'As far back as i can remember i've always wanted to be a gangster' is said by Henry Hill's ( Ray Liotta ) narration and the story starts with a young Henry Hill. Now what Scorsese has done here is introduce us to the brutal nature of both the mob business and the three main characters in an introduction lasting for a bit longer than a minute, it is the ultimate beginning to a movie which instantly sets the tone for everything else there is to come.
You know during the entire movie that anybody could get killed at any time, and what happens is far from predictable, especially when Tommy DeVito ( Joe Pesci ) enters the screen, you have absolutely no idea what to expect. One of the other reasons Goodfellas is such a masterpiece is due to the incredible cast it has. Robert de Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci & Paul Sorvino in the lead all seem to actually be mobsters, instead of acting like them. Enhanced by further excellent performances by Lorraine Bracco & Frank Vincent, it really is an acting masterpiece of film.The movie follows the life of Henry Hill together with excellent narraton provided by Ray Liotta from the 50s all the way up to the very start of the 80s, and as the movie starts out with the mostly positive and beneficial terms of the mob life for Henry, which usually has 50s love songs playing in the background, later in the timeline of the movie things get bloody and ugly and Scorsese both changes the tone of the songs to give it a more serious vibe and he also changes the generations of them ( for example, 50s songs for the 50s parts, 60s for the 60s.. etc. ). It immerses you into the film and the timeline that is being played at that point.Ofcourse the single greatest sequence is the Copacabana steadycam shot through the kitchen. Trackingshots are always impressive, but even more so when it also tells the story of how popular Henry is. With a fantastic screenplay, dialogue that never seems to be out of place, superb acting, brilliant music choices, lack of sugarcoating and actually showing the facts of how brutal the mob life can be, it is an absolute masterpiece of cinema.",9,0,0,15 April 2018
The Godfather," An epic family ballad
","Whereas some films disregard immediate reality and seek to convey a certain message in its sub text, The Godfather is the kind of motion picture that seeks to bring forth reality exactly how it was, and does this by creating a kind of family bonding that is as near perfectly structured as it can be.Of course, The Godfather still utilizes cinematic moments, and has one of the greatest character arcs in cinema ( Michael's ). The film starts with a wedding sequence of half an hour, all in which we are introduced into the world of the characters, and their respective business. We see Don Vito Corleone ( Marlon Brando ) calmly doubting the sincerity of an undertaker's request, we see Santino Corleone ( James Caan ) breaking a camera of a journalist, we see Michael Corleone ( Al Pacino ) being the one soul that seems to be absent from most of the family at that part, telling us the story of the characters and personalities wonderfully. Due to this extended opening sequence, we also get a feel for the brotherhood and warmth that the mob can also possess. It is, of course, a sad cover for what is to come afterwards, as The Godfather is also somewhat of a study on the self destructive nature of man, as nearly every character in the end pays for price for immorality.The Godfather is one of the best acted films of all-time. Most of this is of course because of Marlon Brando, who is deliberately made up like a 'bulldog' to fit his personality. The mannerisms & voice are somehow exactly what one would think when thinking of the founder of a gigantic mob empire. There is not really a weak spot in the acting throughout the entire picture, but other standouts are James Caan & Robert Duvall. Of course Al Pacino also set himself on the map with this performance as the good hearted war hero transforms into the stoic and calculated don of the family. As stated before, the film is near perfectly structured, with events always coinciding with character ( Take the final scene of Michael in Italy for example, with his wife getting killed in the car bomb. This scene is only there to further disconnect Michael emotionally between his work and his life, further sending him down the dark path to becoming the Don ), being the result of one of the greatest screenplays of all-time.The Godfather features cinematography befitting its subject, as a lot of shots are very scarcely lit. In particular the scenes indoors where the mob business is being discussed, the darkness makes sure that only the faces and the white parts of the outfit are shown, as they are mostly wearing black during these scenes. This was to emphasize how 'shady' the dealings of the mob were, and this darkness enhances this feeling in the audience.The original score by Nino Rota is also one worthy of mention, as it perfectly encapsulates what this movie is about; friendship, family, beauty & tragedy. Being an Italian composer who has previously composed other (Italian) masterpieces such as The Leopard (1963) & Rocco and his Brothers (1960), he also manages to give the Godfather this italian atmosphere, further enhancing the immersion into the roots of this family.In the end, The Godfather is mainly about Michael's slow ascent to the top of the ladder in the family. He doesn't want to have anything to do with the business of the family at first, but he feels compelled to act when assassins try to assassinate his father, feeling that he is the only one who can get close enough to his enemies to eliminate them, and after he has done so, the events he witnesses in italy cause him to develop an even more emotionally disconnected personality that makes him feel compelled to take his family's throne. By the end, there is a sequence which contrasts the baptism of Michael's new nephew with the simultaneous murder of all of his competition ( Other mob bosses ), in a stunning sequence of moral duality. While Bach's satanic score plays, and enhances in sound significantly when Michael is asked if he renounces Satan. One of the masterful scenes in a masterful film, it perfectly shows us his final personal descent into immorality & emotional disconnection.The Godfather is an epic family ballad of themes and tragedies, while also being exceptionally well made. It features some of the best acting & writing of all-time, superbly darkly lit sets to enhance atmosphere and a fantastic original score while being near perfectly structured. All of which cements this as one of the world's greats of mob & rise to power movies.",9,0,1,30 April 2019
