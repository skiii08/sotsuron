The Sound of Music," The Most Beautiful Movie Ever Made
","This is the first movie I ever saw in the theatre, the year was 1967.Upon reviewing it the first time it was shown on TV, I have to say this is a movie that must be viewed on the big screen, for TV greatly diminishes the effect.I remember it from a child's point of view, but this is largely a film about children for children by the child-at-heart. The plot is religious, the songs uplifting to heaven, the scenery heaven on earth. Robert Wise, the screenwriters, Rogers and Hammerstein, all the performers  all geniuses.Then  political reality. The pristine Salzburg is besieged by the most compelling evil humanity has ever spawned.The obvious critiques of 'The Sound of Music' are its unwavering sentiment, and many viewers are repelled by its depiction of wealth, happiness and saccharin love. Any hardened adult should recall the basic message of this movie: You Find the Beauty in Life and Yourself and Those Around You.Cheers: It's a Musical. Some of the greatest songs ever committed to the stage. Wonderful ensemble cast. Exquisitely set and filmed. The best family movie ever made. The finest movie ever filmed.Caveats: Long. Religious. Sentimental, to the point of repulsion in a few of us ( not me ).Rating: A Solid, Well Deserved Ten Stars.",10,1,7,1 October 2002
The Polar Express," One More Time, with Feeling
","Having seen 'The Polar Express' with my family this past weekend, I was left with several impressions. First, the negative: CGi works well on backgrounds, much less so on human beings; some characters were monstrous; The North Pole cityscape looked more like Poland during the war than 'Christmastown'; the sound was too loud; the movie would have benefited greatly without the new characters and a shorter running time; some voice talents were totally miscast; the mood of the film is too bleak for young children. On the positive: there's some memorable songs; fantastic use of color; a faithfulness to the illustrations of the Chris Van Allsburg book ( which is the main reason the producers chose to render the entire film in CGi ); breathtaking nature scenes; a real kinetic energy; most of the children seemed to love it  which is the point, really  after all, it IS a movie designed for children.Consider the source material: I find the book rather bleak in itself.For me, it's one of Allsburg's lesser writes, though it's not void of charm. It should be for older children who are on the cusp of that basic level of maturity that questions the less logical aspects of life. That age group surely has graduated from pictures books. Or is it more a book for the precocious six year old who's unfortunately been informed by another less impressionable child that Santa Claus isn't real? Which is it? I'll guess the latter is probably the closest to the author's target. If true, the likely truth is that those children are in the minority, and the book's main fault is that it attracts an audience too wide than it's intended audience.Which is why the movie also is awkward in its approach to Christmas. Children see the Rankin/Bass productions on TV, then see 'The Polar Express' and begin to think, 'Gee, is The North Pole REALLY like that?' This modern depiction of The North Pole is a quantum leap from those old TV shows. I suppose that all these disparate depictions of The North Pole only fuel children's suspicions. Children thrive on familiarity, and The North Pole has been depicted, up to this point, thousands of ways. It's no wonder they start to question everything! The CGi people come off weird, unnatural and sometimes downright frightening. Remember that movie 'Westworld'? You've got it! I think the better idea would have been placing live actors in the backgrounds, as in 'Mary Poppins'. The charm factor would have been ratcheted way up. Why wasn't this done? Supposedly the director didn't want to bother with child actors. Huh?!? How can one get that childhood feeling while being surrounded mostly by adults during the production? 'One more time, with feeling.' As for the volume, all movies are too loud today. But the sudden noises and decibel level are totally inappropriate for this film. If I were a kid and saw this movie, I'd be treated to nightmares at bedtime.What did my six year old think? She loved it! Mostly she loved the train scenes where the movie show the workings of the train and the amazing speeds of which it's capable. Which is the weakness of my review  most kids loved this movie. But some younger children were scared by it. What  Christmas scary? Leave that to 'A Christmas Carol', which is NOT for young kids! WHY toddlers were brought in to see this at our viewing is indicative of the lack of natural feeling people seem to exhibit nowadays. Have we really gotten so desensitized that ideas and common sense have to be bludgeoned into our minds? So, proceed with caution.Cheers: Beautiful backgrounds; breathtaking nature scenes; some good songs; a movie that really moves; fascinating animation; faithful to the book; teaches that faith is important in life; a crowd-pleaser.Caveats: Scary characters; too loud; bleak; awkward; animated dead people; too long; way too intense for impressionable five year-olds.Match, cut.",5,3,5,22 November 2004
Casino Royale," 'Casino Royale' Deals a Straight Flush
","My wife and I just returned from seeing 'Casino Royale', and I give this film my wholehearted approval.For the EON franchise, it's back to basics, the gadgets are no more sophisticated than cell phones and laptops, which just goes to show how much gadgetry has permeated every facet of our society, and instead the story is front and center, as it should be. To be short, this film is right in line with Fleming's cold war spy story 'From Russia with Love', and that's a great thing, because many of us are tired of formulaic plots with action supplacing story. The twists and turns consistently support the story rather than reaching implausible dead ends that leave the viewer thinking, 'What was that?' Not everything is neatly tied at the end, but one realizes that the outcome will be moot.There are surprises, and one of the surprises is not that Craig fits the shoes of his character, but the fact that a character is developing here. Not since 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' have we seen Bond more vulnerable or accessible. This Bond is human, and while Craig's emotional display mirrors that of Timothy Dalton's performances, Craig's range goes farther. This is exactly what this series has needed for decades, and for once we're not getting a comic book hero with lots of popcorn-spilling chase scenes that pad the running time.Dame Judi Dench gets some of the best lines, and my only regret is she'll get too old for the part for many more movies. She is a wonderful counterpart to Craig and occupies Bernard Lee's desk proudly.One wonders, though, if this good combination will last. Obviously, this is the last Fleming novel to be filmed reasonably faithfully, and stories will be left to copycats, so those writers will have large shoes to fill indeed. I hope that no one is considering remaking any of the Connery era films to bring continuity to a nearly 50 year-old series. That would be a most grievous mistake.'Casino Royale' is a most welcome return to form.Cheers: Nice update, story, serious tone, realistic, sparer production, suspense, strategy, character studies with wider emotional range, appropriate violence, soundtrack, sensible plot twists, well-placed jokes, casting, direction, set design, film locations.Caveats: Craig physically villainous, missing familiar series' elements, the last Fleming novel to be filmed.",9,0,2,5 January 2007
