The Devil's Advocate," Al Pacino made this movie!
","I have always loved Al Pacino as a villain. I can do without Jeffery Jones, Craig T. Nelson and even Reeves. Theron was good in this movie as the wife who was confused and insecure. But, without Al Pacino as Lucifer, this movie would have been garbage. It had a decent at best script and a not-too-surprising twist at the end. But, what I remember most of this movie is Al Pacinos' rants about god. 'Apsentee landlord', 'Sadist', 'Worship that, never'. It was interesting to see how Lucifer might view god as the villain, punishing men for their choices. You can look, don't touch, touch, don't taste, taste, don't swallow, and while your jumping from one foot to the next, he's laughing his sick f&*#(*& a** off.",9,1,1,6 January 2008
I Am Legend," Why couldn't it be longer? More realistist? Not end so quick?
","Here's an idea, lets take a potentially great movie and make it just good! Will smith doesn't look fifty! And, as a scientist, he is not very convincing. I liked the movie and was very hyped up to see it. It was good but it could have been soooooo much better! I would have liked more back story and not such a quick ending. I would have liked some of the special effects to look better than they did. The lion towards the beginning didn't even look as good as the animals in Jumanji. I really didn't like the opening scene with the perfect, brand new off the lot product placement. Overall I give it a seven because I can understand what the director was trying to do and it was a better than average effort. But, it could have been great and it falls way way short!!!!",7,0,1,2 January 2008
The Shawshank Redemption," Very good movie, but is it one of the best ever?
","I remember seeing this movie back when it first came out. I have watched it several times since then. I really like this movie, but in my opinion their are a lot of movies that are much better. When I look at the top 250 I cringe at this one. I think that movies like this belong among the top 250, but I feel that this one lacks what is needed to be towards the top of that list. Movies such as citizen kane, clockwork orange, or pulp fiction should not be lower on the list than this one. A good movie is one that is well written and acted. A great movie is one that redefines movie making and does something that has not been done before, or at least something that is going to be remembered forever. The godfather deserves top billing on the list. It was very well written, very real and had lines that are repeated daily in movies, television or in talk around the coffee pot. All I remember from shawshank is Tim Robbins hands in the air after he escapes.",9,0,0,30 December 2007
