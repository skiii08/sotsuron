Raiders of the Lost Ark," A roller coaster ride on celluloid
","The reason this movie sticks with me is that it is the only film that I could have walked out on after 20 minutes and still felt I'd gotten my money's worth. That first scene, which serves no other purpose than simply to 'establish the Indiana Jones character' is a classic of pacing, cinematography and special effects. A mini masterpiece within a great film.Despite a few historical 'quirks', it's a fun, fast-paced story that takes you away from your cares for 2 hours while it whisks you around the world and back in time. Can't ask for anything more than that.",8,0,0,22 March 1999
The Shining," A 'shining' example of how King doesn't translate well to film
","I gotta say, the TV miniseries (done years later, I'll admit) was better than this film. Kubrick's adaptation is somewhat scary, but more 'foreboding' than scary. More proof that Steven King stories don't make movies that are nearly as great as the printed product.Too many important details of the story are left out, and we don't get a good enough sense of the true history of the Overlook. It's these details that create the *real* horror. The miniseries explored them more, and so it was, to me, much scarier, even though I pretty much knew what was going to happen.The worst offense of this film is an over-the-top, over-acting Jack Nicholson and his undeservedly classic 'Here's Johnny' line.",Null,1,3,22 March 1999
The Usual Suspects," A movie you can't see just once!
","In the words of Fred Fenster, this movie, 'will flip ya. Flip ya for real.' It's raw, gritty and stylish. And you won't figure out what's going on before it's revealed to you.",10,0,1,22 March 1999
The Godfather: Part III," The 'worst' of the series, but not bad
","This movie only commits two cardinal errors (pun intended)1) It follows perhaps the two best movies ever 2) The casting for Mary CorleoneOther than that, GFIII is a good film in its own right. It isn't great, but it's very good. The plot is right up there with the other two predecessors. The development of characters isn't as good, but hey, these characters are already developed. The ending is somewhat anti-clamactic and unfortunately, leaves you wanting for more. There should never be another in this series, leave well enough alone.Now, back to the Mary casting: I cannot *believe* that a man as brilliant and intelligent as F.F. Coppola would be so arrogant as to nepotistically cast an unproven, ineffective actress in a central role like Mary. Unbelievable. It's the only taint on the entire series of films.One of the best moments of the film: when Vincent is brought into the room with Zasa and is trying (unsuccesfully) to control himself, as he says, 'What am I gonna do with this guy, eh?' he does a body movement that makes you swear James Caan is back playing Sonny. Gives you chills to watch it.",7,0,1,24 March 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," Great, uplifting drama, with one flaw...
","I'm sorry, I can't buy these guys as criminals, and that ruined the 'suspension of disbelief' for me. Otherwise, an excellent story.",7,2,3,22 March 1999
The Thin Red Line," What horsesh*&
","This movie was totally awful, with the exception of a few well done battle scenes. The director and writer must both have seen Apocolypse Now's flawed last 1/2 hour, taken all the worst 'oooooh, this is meaningful, and this is arty' Hopper/Brando offal from it, and then sullied the memory of the men who fought and died at Guadalcanal with this 'girly-man' war flick.Dialogue that means nothing (offset by dialog you can't hear, but why bother, because it probably means nothing too), symbolism without symbols, whole scenes that go nowhere and are left hanging; the whole movie plays like they took what ended up on the cutting room floor for the final print.",4,0,0,15 September 1999
Goodfellas," A classic gangster film in its own right.
","All gangster movies will inevitably be compared to 'The Godfather' series, but this one shines because it takes a daring, and hugely successful risk in not playing it for serious drama the whole way. It actually almost succeeds in making you 'like' Henry Hill and his crew of Wiseguys. With the witty narration and comedic style, it's almost a fun comedy...and then, suddenly, savagely, it wrenches you back to reality as the plot takes a sinister, nasty turn.The classic scene in this picture has to be how Tommy (Joe Pesci) establishes the true maniacal menace of his character, without any *doubt*, and without any bloodshed. A lesser film would have shown you a few bloody examples of what Tommy is capable of as a sensational copout. The brinksmanship of the 'You think I'm funny?' scene sells his character well before the trouble starts.",9,0,0,22 March 1999
The Godfather," As close to a perfect movie as there's ever been
","This one has it all. The casting, the acting, the plot, the cinematography, the plot twists. It is simply almost above reproach. Many say GFII is the better movie, but because it tells 2 stories instead of one, my nod goes to the original Godfather.",10,0,1,22 March 1999
