Requiem for a Dream," a work of art
","watching this film was an experience. it was more than entertainment. it's surely the saddest film I have ever seen but also the best. it's about something bad. something that we try to avoid. avoid talking about it and of course use it. it's about drug addiction and it's something unpleasant. Aronofsky doesn't fear the ugly and cruel reality and through it he gives us a masterpiece. he makes us feel bad and think. think about his film and after a while think about what the film is trying to tell us. 4 people who end up really bad because of their addictions. 4 unforgettable performances from all the actors. Burstyn's monologues with her son and her lunatic acting at the end are going to stay in you for ever. they made me cry. but what makes this movie special is its ending. it's not a happy one. it shows the protagonists' decay. one ends up with a cut arm. one ends a lunatic. one ends in prison. only the girl is happy. but she's happy after she has participated in a private peep show with other addicted girls. with a huge bag full of her love. so this isn't really happy either, is it?... and there is more. Aronofsky did not stop at finding a touching and sad theme to make us cry. this movie is the experimentalism on its peak. he is using his techniques so beautifully like when he uses small cuts to show that the protagonists are taking drugs, because he doesn't want to stick to the process but to the conclusion. i absolutely loved it. it's my favorite film and I want to thank Aronofsky for his creative genius!",10,2,4,29 March 2007
Watchmen," There was a good reason they called the novel 'unfilmable'
","Watchmen. My favorite book of all time. One of the most famous graphic novels ever written. Its depth and meaningfulness almost unbearably grand. And who was chosen to direct the film adaptation? Zack Snyder. The guy who became famous for remaking 'Dawn of the Dead' and directing '300'. Now, don't get me wrong, I quite enjoyed both these films, but couldn't anybody see who unsuitable he is to make 'Watchmen'? His films were visually outstanding but none of them had the plot and character depth that 'Watchmen' required.I first saw the trailer the second it emerged on the internet. The shots were promising but nothing was really revealed. A smart trick that made me pay 8 to watch it. But from the first scenes I realized I was in for a very disappointing treat. First I want to point out that Snyder did get some things right. The detailed sets that portrayed Alan Moore's alternate 1980's were really well made and so were the character's costumes. But it seems that after the director took care of these two, started derailing from the graphic novel.I really do not know where to start with what was wrong. The characters, although reciting extracts from the novel, had lost their depth and became marionettes, traveling from one 'visually majestic' shot to the other. The film became really violent and gory and I really don't mind that, I've seen much worse, but the violence simply didn't seem to fit. It was pointless and graphically shot in a similar way to Zack Snyder's previous films without though serving any cause. Many important scenes were savagely shortened in order to make the fighting scenes longer. Rorschach's narration, although extracted from the book, was turned into another cliché, low-voice, tough guy narration, that reminded me of so many other films like Sin City and The Spirit. The plot was also inexplicably changed in so many ways that distorted almost every single one of the book's messages.Zack Snyder did not shoot the novel's adaptation. He just used the atmosphere and alternate reality created by the genius of Alan Moore to create his own piece of visual extravaganza and use its background to promote it. And just to make things clear, this film was not just a bad adaptation of the novel. It was a really disappointing film in general, and my friends who have not read the book agree with me. His three hour 'epic' is visually amazing just like '300' was, but simply does not work with the plot. This story deserves a better film but I hope nobody attempts to make it again.",4,22,35,14 November 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A great end to a great saga
","I literally cried the first time I watched it. I'm 16 .My father is a big fan of the early star wars trilogy and when I was a little kid, instead of watching Toy Story and Lion King, my father made me watch STAR WARS. I have to say, I loved it. I grew up watching all the star wars films whenever I had nothing to do and I kept asking my father, 'why does the first episode have the number four daddy?' 'because they intend to shoot three prequels, son' he would answer me, and I thought, since I didn't live when the early star wars was released, I wouldn't live to see those prequels.I was 8 years old when the first episode was released, and to be honest, I hadn't watched a stars wars movie for a long time. I watched it and understood nothing but the fights. When I watched the second one, I had exercised my critical thinking a bit, and I wasn't that impressed after watching it for a fifth time. When I learned the release date of star wars three, I was heartbroken. I may hate anticipation, but I hate something so great finished too. So, I watched the old star wars movies once more and hoped it was good.I know people say that it wasn't match for the old trilogy and that acting was mediocre and all that, but I was shocked. I was delighted, impressed and deeply touched. People believe that acting was mediocre, but if you watch the old trilogy and then episode III, you will understand that actors do their best to look like their older character, presented in the old trilogy. The scenario is exciting, every single aspect and detail perfectly matches the saga and everything lead to the tragic outcome of the old trilogy. Lucas knew what he was doing when he decided to shoot three prequels. His choice of actors was great. McGregor is always a guarantee of good acting, Hayden is the best dark character 'who still has some good in him' I have ever seen (And I had watched some of his movies before star wars), natalie portman is simply beautiful, Samuel Jackson acts the most powerful Jedi perfectly and Ian McDiarmid is as great as he was in the old saga. I cried and cried on the final scene and especially when the 'new hope' theme plays in the final cut, simply because I knew what happens after all these.I loved the movie, and I strongly recommend it to any old or new Star Wars fan.",10,1,6,14 November 2007
Sin City," Sin City: Booze, Broads and Bullets at Their Best!
","The best way to shoot as film noir is in black and white, and Sin City's director, Robert Rodriguez, seemed to know that well. Sin City is a wild, ferocious pack of violence, gore, S-M/leather-dressed babes, mutilations and hardcore motherf***ers that kill people either to get revenge for the death of a prostitute or to save a sexy 19-year old table dancer from a multiple child-rapist. Not the average people's idea of a film noir but it's still good. The best of its kind actually, Sin City brings comic book adaptations to movies to a whole new level where it's hard to reach. Because Sin City is not simply inspired by a comic book. It IS the comic book.Director Robert Rodriquez, alongside with the creator of the comic book series that inspired this movie, takes us to a trip in a decayed city that is ruled by corrupted politicians and cops, through the stories of three men that include a lot of women. First, is a story of revenge. Marv, exceptionally played by a Frankenstein-face-shaped Mickey Rourke, wakes up next to a dead hooker who had given him the time of his life and promises that he will take revenge. Then comes the story of a modern knight, Dwight (Clive Owen), who tries to save the city's prostitutes from the mob and the pimps. The third story is about a decent and actually good police officer by the name of Hartigan (Bruce Willis) who gets set up by the state's corrupted governor (Powers Boothe) whose son is a child-rapist pervert (Nick Stahl). And if this super-star cast is not enough to impress you, add the hottest Jessica Alba you've ever seen, the tight-leather dressed Rosario Dawson, the drunk and crazy Benicio Del Toro, the massive Michael Clark Duncan, the cannibal Elijah Wood and finally the seductive Brittany Murphy.And it's not only the exceptional acting that makes this movie unique. Rodriquez decided to use as a script and as a storyboard the comic book itself, and that is why he called in its creator to co-direct the movie. The entire movie is created with computer graphics except of course the actors, their props and some small sets. One would imagine an effect similar to the one in 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' where the result looked rather fake-ish and idiotic. What Rodriquez managed to accomplish is a city with the dark and sinister feeling that Frank Miller's city ought to have. Inside their black and white environment, one can notice certain colorful objects such as a babe's lipstick, another one's blonde hair, one's blue, green or golden eyes, red shoes and red blood. And there is a lot of it. Shown either dark red or fluorescent white, blood is something this movie is not missing at. And that is because Rodriguez and Miller did not use some cheap tricks and cuts to get their movie a PG-13 rating like many Hollywood directors use to do. They went all the way. They even hired Rodriguez's pal, Quentin Tarantino, as a 'special guest director' for one dollar, to do a scene where Dwight talks with a corpse inside a car full of dead bodies.Those of you who feel disgusted by the description so far, don't go watch the movie, it gets much worse. You might be used to Rodriguez as a family director for his last lame movie series, 'Spy Kids', but in Sin City Rodriguez shows his true self making a movie alike legendary 'Pulp Fiction' but in black and white. Forget the innocent little Frodo and get ready to face a bloodthirsty cannibal. In fact, forget everything you knew about movies until know. Sin City is an uncompromising vision that does not care about critics and acclaims. Miller's dark and sinister imagination does not get changed in any way besides that it gains movement and life. It's the first time we see a comic book so perfectly and so purely transferred to the big screen unlike the recent rapisms of classic comic books like Spiderman and the Fantastic Four. One must be warned: most people are not going to like Sin City. And I can't blame them of course. It's brutal, raw, violent and sick. But that is what makes it what it is. Not 'Robert Rodriguez's Sin City' or 'Quentin Tarantino's Sin City', but a pure, authentic 'Frank Miller's Sin City'.",10,0,1,29 March 2008
