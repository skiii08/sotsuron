Men in Black 3," Let's have some fun with the aliens
","A comedy with aliens, where wit and humour meets ET!Probably the best movie in the whole saga. The main actors have a real chemistry and enjoy doing this movie. Even the animated creatures have fun!An enjoyable 7 out of 10 movie you won't regret watching, and will laugh with friends about it.",7,0,2,15 October 2017
Unbreakable," Enjoyable but could be way better
","Getting at times lost without being able to fully understand the story isn't something I particularly enjoy, and I've found myself lost during the movie. Now that I've seen it I understand it was perhaps the director's intention to make the audience watch the movie a couple of times in order to fully enjoy it... They could have invented a better explanation to why the main character is unbreakable and explored it sooner. The end feels rushed but there are no significant loose ends. It is a movie that one can enjoy watching but not particularly remarkable in any way. That is why I gave it a 6 out of 10.",6,1,1,18 September 2017
Fight Club," Hyped classic of emptiness
","I was actually looking forward to watch this movie... but after watching it, I think it is a crazy ride to nowhere! Mixes chaos theory with organization and leadership, and then makes a U-turn to where it started - the inner struggles of an everyday man.This movie literally tries to mean so much to so many people that I can't believe how anyone can feel connected to it. It uses violence as a show and simple chaos to amuse. Is it worth watching? Sure as the acting is done brilliantly. Will it be remembered and revisited after some time? No, I don't think so...",3,1,2,27 November 2017
The Hateful Eight," One of the most realistic westerns I've ever seen!
","A great story that will surprise you till the very end despite being unfolded right before your very eyes. Is it violent? Yes. Is the violence graphic? Yes. Is it unnecessary violent at times? Oh yes. Nevertheless, it can be enjoyable to watch as the violence is an integral part of the Wild West, and why this movie is only suited for a more mature audience.Tarantino enjoys taking us to the middle of the action, and we feel part of the movie. We follow and understand the main characters, and we feel sometimes touched by their life's story. But life in the Wild West is harsh (and if we don't know this, we will figure it out pretty quickly).It definitely is a movie worth watching and you won't even feel the time passing by.",8,0,1,27 November 2017
Interstellar," What a journey!
","The most beautiful space age movie I have ever seen, and one of the best ever made. You passionately understand and sympathize with the story from the very beginning! Matthew McConaughey brilliant performance makes sure that we as an audience follow his heart and mind, sometimes he doesn't even has to say anything and we know what he wants and where he is going. Brilliantly written as it makes us eager to know what happens next and it ends with a proper ending without needing a sequel! However, if they decide to make one even better, I will certainly watch it!This is what Hollywood should do more often!A must-see 10 out of 10 movie!",10,0,1,11 October 2017
Ant-Man," Should have been better
","Ant-Man promises much but doesn't deliver. Probably the weakest link of every Marvel movie ever made... It depends too much on special effects and there isn't the wit we are used to in other Marvel movies. A likable next door neighbor kind of guy that is a hero in disguise is a recipe that has been delivering for some time but the special 'X factor' we look forward to in a hero just isn't there. And I'm not blaming the actor's performance, I'm blaming the poor writing. Too much time was spent around a computer making sure the special effects were spot on but not that much time was spent writing a believable story that every fan would like to watch.5 out of 10. This is a movie to forget by Marvel. Apparently there will be a sequel, I just hope they improve what they have done here, as the fans deserve it.",5,0,1,14 October 2017
Oblivion," A beautiful movie you won't regret seeing
","Brilliant writing; great performance by the actors; beautiful and realistic scenery; wit that makes us laugh, and a story we passionately follow with a proper ending that make us think about what does matter in life.What more can one want from a movie? 9 out of 10 for what may be one of the best movies ever made in this genre.",9,6,6,14 October 2017
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," One of the classics everyone should watch
","Everyone who loves to watch movies and great performances by the main actors should watch this one. This movie isn't a comedy by any means but it has humour in spades to make one enjoy it and face the reality of what happened in Vietnam. It is amazing how humour does ease the pain and formidable hurdles one has to overcome in life (and especially in war)This is surely one of the best Robin Williams' movies and probably one of the best showcases of his personal life: bringing joy and laughter to those around him, not showing that he had to face his (inner) demons like everyone else around him... His talent is obvious in this one, and I miss him...A 10 out of 10 movie that everyone should watch.",10,0,0,24 October 2017
"I, Robot"," A glimpse of our (not so distant) future
","Everyone is excited about having a friendly robot doing errands but there is an increasing trend of smart people telling us to not naively trust something other humans have created. This movie steps into that debate and although it has valid arguments for both theories, in the end a cautious judgment about everything and everyone wins the day.A great movie that does show us a plausible glimpse of our (not so distant) future, and one that makes us think about where we are going in terms of technology and the future of mankind.8 out of 10 to a movie I enjoyed watching.",8,0,1,15 October 2017
The Fast and the Furious," The first and the best
","The first movie of the successful saga is probably the best one. We are introduced to the main characters and to a world most of us had only heard of. You will laugh, you might cry, you may even want vengeance... You won't leave the theater or your living room without feeling some kind of emotion.I was fortunate enough to watch this in one of the best movie theaters in the country so I could enjoy the sound effects in all of their glory! However, as a petrolhead, I have to forget how many times they change gears (9 times? Really?!) to properly enjoy the movie about special cars and a large family (in the truest sense of how a family should be).The cars are also loud actors who are given to the right characters. The actors really studied and embraced their role to a point where we can feel their emotions and identify ourselves with some of them. There is a real chemistry between them and that is a very positive thing in this type of movies.10 out of ten to the best movie of one of the most successful sagas ever launched by Hollywood. Everyone who wants to properly enjoy it should start by watching this one.",10,1,1,14 October 2017
The Grand Budapest Hotel," You have to watch it
","Ralph Fiennes shows why he is considered a great actor! You can easily follow the story, you will understand the characters and most of all you won't feel the time passing by... Isn't this the main reason why movies exist? You will laugh, you may cry and next time you visit an hotel you will remember this staff. 9 out of 10.",9,3,4,18 September 2017
Cars," A great one for the whole family (and petrolheads alike!)
","This movie is a great foundation of what will surely be a successful saga in years to come!Dads will enjoy taking their kids to the nearest theater or living room to watch this one. In the first minute, we forget that they are animated cars and we can see them like real actors developing a story of speed(!), friendship, camaraderie and dare I say love?The 911 girl is a special touch for me as a Porsche enthusiast. And I can't help but laugh every time (Tow) Mater enters the room and steals the spotlight from Lightning McQueen. The movie every Dad wanted to see when they were their kid's age has to be a good one!10 out of 10 to a movie I enjoy 'revisiting' from time to time.",10,0,0,14 October 2017
Elysium," A good entertaining movie
","This was a nice surprise as I didn't even know this movie existed before watching it on TV. The main characters and the futuristic science fiction made me watch it.I think they could have better addressed the issues of an over-populated and diseased Earth (that can indeed resemble our future planet). From a macro story of the Earth's population, the movie focus too quickly on the micro story of two or three main characters. The golden Paradise of Elysium is poorly shown, it almost felt like there wasn't any money left to show it properly as we only get glimpses of what is going on in there... This is in my opinion the biggest mistake of the movie.The whole story is a good one, heartwarming even, but sometimes skips logical steps perhaps to prevent the movie from being too long but also making it just one more science fiction story that we enjoy watching but will hardly 'revisit' from time to time.The acting was great, I felt sorry about Matt Damon's anger and troubled life. It is definitely worth watching but not good enough to be remembered.",6,0,1,5 December 2017
Up," A great one for the whole family
","The humour of this movie is such a great one that everyone will enjoy watching it! The story is such a good one that the kids will learn a thing or two about our world and other (older) people. We as adults will also enjoy the story for its beautiful simplicity. A back to basics that will remind us how to properly behave with each other. The world would be a better one if some of this movie's lessons were applied more often in our everyday life.9 out of 10 for a movie no one will regret seeing, regardless of age.",9,0,0,14 October 2017
The Departed," A rush of feelings and action
","Martin Scorsese proves once more why he is one of the greatest! The story is great because of how real it feels, as a spectator we don't know beforehand what is coming, we are surprised by the story development and it is amazing how quickly we understand what is being done, and why it is being done. The world can be tough and we have to do our best to not be eaten alive by the circumstances.Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Demon and the Legend Jack Nicholson make this story feel real and the two hours and change you will need to watch this movie will feel like 15 minutes!Absolutely a must-watch 10 out of 10 movie!",10,0,2,24 October 2017
The Wrestler," A great movie about show business and real life
","I really appreciate when the actors do the 'extra mile' to portray their characters; when their performance feels so natural, so real that their emotions touch you. For the most part of the movie I forgot that I was seeing one, and it seemed like a documentary about an aging wrestler (Mickey Rourke) and a stripper (Marisa Tomei).I have to say that both Mickey and Marisa gave everything they got to their characters. Their performance was simply outstanding, the best work I've ever seen from them. It becomes violent and sexual at times, odd scenes that really don't add much to the whole story (and prevent this movie to be seen by an younger audience) but I think this movie should be seen and reflected upon by everyone, regardless of age.It is easy to not care about the future when the present is filled with success and popularity but it is after those golden years that the real life begins, and many successful people aren't prepared to have a quiet anonymous life. This movie shows us that struggle and how unprepared one can be.The Wrestler's example should teach us a thing or two about life's choices and what we can do to prevent choosing the wrong things. I love when movies makes us think about our own lives.",9,1,2,2 November 2017
