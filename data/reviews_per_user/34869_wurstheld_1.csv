Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," stepping out of line to become the most enjoyable
","I had low expectations but was rewarded with all you could get from a movie like that - a perfect 7 star entertainment!I wasn't a big fan of the predecessors, because I was probably expecting them to be more like Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. Fun entertainment with a simple yet interesting plot, including good jokes, beautiful actresses and actors portraying pleasantly caricatured characters as well as fascinating sets and action. Compared to the other movies with dozens of unfinished subplots, annoyingly stupid supernatural characters combined with cgi all over the place, main plots that are both boring and confusing (without the positive effect some complexity can have), this was brilliant.You will have no, or at least believe you don't have, long lasting scenes of boring cgi covering 90% of the screen - like giant octopuses or eternal fights with indestructible skeletons, but instead some mermaids with character. Shortening might have been possible, but all you want from a film like that is to lure you into another world for a while - why not for a bit longer?",7,1,2,29 May 2011
