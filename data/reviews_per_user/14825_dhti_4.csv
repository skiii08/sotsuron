Come and See," Great movie
","Amazing movie, really shows the Russian suffering. The depiction of the Germans is sovjet propaganda though. It conflicts with everything known about German culture. The Germans act as sovjets. A shame of an otherwise great movie by a great director.",7,1,1,22 December 2018
Get Out," Highly overrated
","The movie is well acted and well made but the script is highly flawed. The movie is called 'Get out' but for some reason the main character refuses to get out. The of one girl having many boyfriends who disappear without any police investigation and being the only source for her family seems silly. The idea is interesting but if the people are still acting as their former selves, who would want to do something like that. The friend of the main character goes to the police and tells a story nobody would believe in a ridiculous way, isn't this a college student who should have some form of rationality. I really couldn't find any rationality in this movie. I would give this movie a 6.5 but because it really is overhyped scriptwise I gave it a 1.",1,8,12,21 July 2018
A Quiet Place," silly
",So many options but it seems some idiots who could impossibly be survivors did survive is this movie is about how the didn't? Truly silly. Great idea though,2,1,1,17 July 2018
Alien: Covenant," Truly Idiotic
","It seems as if everybody who is on this mission has an iq of minus 10. there is no future in this reality where the people selected for a mission to a new planet have to be as stupid as a cow. It truly is a movie where the stupidity of people is being used as excuse for easy so called tension/horror scenes. Yes, another one of those; 'we do not know how to create suspense so let's make everybody in the movie an idiot to make it easy for us as directors'.",1,3,6,29 July 2017
