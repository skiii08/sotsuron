United 93," Gut Wrenching, Must SEE!!!!!!
","I went to see this movie with open expectations based on what I had heard through others who had already seen this movie. The movie takes on a real life account of the day that we would come to know as simply 9-11. I was across the river from the Pentagon when it was struck, and watched with my own eyes as the events unfolded in DC. I knew two of the people who were killed on that morning in the Pentagon. It is a hard pill to swallow to bring back those memories that we as Americans have tried to put behind us.... But should we really try and forget those brave people who lost their lives on Flight 93, or any other flight that went down that morning. Absolutely Not!!! It is my belief that if this film was supported by the families of those who lost their lives, then who are we as Monday morning quarterbacks to say a word about whether we think this film is appropriate or not. I think every American, Man, Woman and child should go and watch this movie out of respect for those people who have lost their lives due to the events of terrorism. I left the theater with the same pride of being an American that so many thousands of us had in the months following the attacks.. Semper Fi and God Bless America!!!!!!!!",10,4,8,17 May 2006
