The Benchwarmers," Why?
","I just watched The Benchwarmers on DVD. I was ready for stupidity and fart jokes. I was ready to laugh. Did I laugh? 7 times. Only a few minor giggles, though. The rest was incredibly stupid and boring. Anyway, this movie is about a few guys who see a kid getting farted on, so they start a baseball team and win a few games. Eventually, they become famous with nerds and blah blah blah. The movie sucked. Jon Heder plays Clark, a retarded paperboy. David Spade plays Ritchie, a 39 year-old virgin who works at a video store. Rob Schneider plays Gus, a guy that's a repairman or something like that. It makes me sick that Jon Heder was in this! Napolean Dynamite was a very funny movie, and this makes NP look like Pulp Fiction, which it is not! The funniest character was Howie. And he's not even a main character! 3/10. Watch it, you probably won't laugh though.",3,0,0,3 August 2006
Spider-Man 3," Gasp!
","I did not care for Spider-Man 3. Don't get me wrong, Spider-Man is one of my favorite super-heroes ever. He's a great hero. Along with the Silver Surfer, he's probably my favorite hero. Spider-Man was a very good movie, and it was extremely well-done, as well as Spider-Man 2, which I think surpassed the first. However, both of these films surpass the third.I had very, very, VERY high expectations for this movie. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but honestly, this IS a very boring movie. It's about two and half hours long, but about fifty minutes are taken up with boring romantic scenes. Yes, most, if not all, super-heroes have a girl-friend, lately in super-hero films they have been adding that in just to extend the length of the movie, like in Superman Returns, which, for the record, was way better than this.The comedy in it was not funny at all, but pretty much everyone in the theater was roaring with laughter. I will admit that the scene with the great Bruce Cambell were pretty much awesome, being one of the highlights of the film.The acting? It was good for the most part, but a lot of times it was cheesy, and some of the dialog was cheesy, but that stuff wasn't a big flaw of the film.The fighting? The action scenes were the best parts of the film. Many of the scenes were very good scenes, such as the final battle with Spidey, Harry, Sandman, and Venom. This was the best part of the whole movie. The fights with the Sandman were very good as well, in my opinion anyway. The scene at the bell was pretty good too.But another thing I didn't like was the amount of story lines in it. A Spider-Man movie shouldn't have one million plot lines and a thousand villains. The three villain thing was okay, but I prefer the classic one villain storyline. And the fact that they made it to where Flint Marko, the Sandman, was actually the killer of Uncle Ben, was just unneeded. Now all of the people who never read the comic book will be stuck with this knowledge, when it really isn't knowledge at all. It's just bull crap.What about Gwen Stacy? Didn't she play a huge part in the film? NO! She appeared in about four scenes. She didn't play a huge part at all. They messed up her character in the first movie though. In the comic book, Gwen is killed by the original(Norman Osbourne) Green Goblin. What about in this? She dangles from a building, and is saved by Spider-Man afterwards. I still liked that she actually made an appearance though.After naming so much bad and so little good, I guess I should say some good so I won't anger people too badly. Sandman looked perfect in this film. No joke, he looked excellent. This is exactly how he looks in the comic. Green shirt, and a muscular body, with sand. A+! Venom? This was perfect as well. He is most peoples' favorite Spider-Man villain, and his appearances in this movie were great. In my opinion anyway.Green Goblin II? I can take it or leave it, but it was a large part of the movie.So overall, Spider-Man 3 did not suck. No, it did not suck at all. It has some great stuff in it. The battle scenes save it, as well as the excellent costumes for the villains, excluding Green Goblin II for obvious reasons. C'mon, a robotic suit? Oh well. That was a flaw in the first movie. Anyway, the movie is ruined by the fact that it's just too boring. A super-hero movie lots of action is more liked by me than a super-hero film that's one third action and two thirds romance and pointless scenes.5/10",5,1,2,5 May 2007
Saw III," The worst of the 3
","In 2004, Saw was released. It was a good movie, but it wasn't great. A year later, Saw II came out. It was a great movie! Definitely one of the better horror sequels out there. But, it seems like everything goes downhill with 3. Scary Movie 3 was a very funny movie, but not as good as SM1 or 2. Scream 3, Halloween 3, it's the same with a bunch of movies. 3 may be a magic number, but it rarely is with movies. Horror mainly. And that's true with Saw III as well.Before I get to the good stuff, let's go over the bad stuff. The traps weren't that great. They all did the same stuff. They blew up stuff. One froze some naked chick, and another twisted this guy, and another one drowned people with freakin' pig guts! Another thing is that they went overboard with gore and blood. They showed a full naked body, they showed tons of blood, they even said a certain word that starts with a 'c' and means the same thing as a part of the woman anatomy.Also, the movie was too long. The other Saw films were pretty short. The first was about 100 minutes, and Saw II was 92 minutes. This is 107 minutes. Too long. An ultra gory flick like this only needs to be about as long as, well, Saw II.That's the bad stuff. Next comes the good stuff.Oops! Forgot another bad thing: TOO MANY OUT-OF-PLACE FLASHBACKS! Some flashbacks were needed, but others were flashbacks of stuff that happened in THIS MOVIE. They showed each flashback about 100 times.Right now, I don't feel like naming the good stuff. I just hope they DON'T make a Saw IV. If they do, I'll rent it, but I won't spend 6 bucks on a movie ticket. Besides, Jigsaw's dead. I know they can write him in somehow, but he's dead.Who knows, though? Maybe Saw IV will be good. Halloween 4 was better than Halloween 3.",6,1,2,6 November 2006
Batman Begins," Best Batman Movie Yet!
","I loved this movie. Everything was good! There were only a few boring parts. The Batmobile looked dumb, but who cares? This movie was good! I didn't think this movie looked too good when I saw the preview, but I was wrong. This is the best superhero movie since Spider-Man 2. There's action and everything! This is a must-see movie. It's long, but it's not one of those movies where you think 'God, this is long! When will it end?' It's long in a good way. If you're a fan of Batman, you'll love this movie. I'm glad it's on the top 250 movies. That's where it needs to be. It's got a good storyline too. I give Batman Begins two thumbs up.",8,4,5,12 February 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Non-stop action! Great movie!
","Uma Thurman plays The Bride, a girl that was shot by Bill and wants revenge! Kill Bill Vol. 1 is one of those movies that are just fun to watch. It's got action, violence, more action, more violence, and maybe some other stuff, too!The scene where The Bride kills all the Crazy 88 is a great scene. Blood's flying everywhere while she's cutting off arms, legs, heads, and hands! Then The Bride battles O-Ren Ishi, the first on her list to die! You have to watch this movie! Only a guy that doesn't like good movies would dislike this masterpiece! I give Kill Bill Volume 1 a 9/10! I LOVE THIS MOVIE!",9,0,3,24 February 2006
Saw II," Surprisingly good sequel
","I knew this would be good when I rented it on DVD. I didn't think it would be this good! Saw II is the sequel to the 2004 horror flick Saw. Detective Mason finds Jigsaw after another murder. Mason has to join Jigsaw's game when he finds out his son is in the game with another bunch of people.This one has way more traps than the original Saw. The hand trap, the needle pit, and more! There are so many new and interesting traps. I really liked this movie. It was violent and gruesome and freaky, but that's why it's called a horror movie. A movie called Saw II has to be really violent. C'mon! Saw! You know what's weird? I don't think anyone even uses a saw in this one, unlike the first one.8/10. Really enjoyed this one. Fun movie.",8,0,1,24 February 2006
Saw," I liked it!
","Saw is a very good movie. It's dark and gruesome. A doctor and a photographer are kidnapped and put in a room. There are clues and stuff to where items are hidden. The best parts are outside of this room, where Danny Glover(the guy from Lethal Weapon) is looking for Jigsaw with the help of his Chinese partner.After Danny Glover's partner is killed in a trap, he goes crazy and starts paying the guy who's trapped in the room 200 bucks a night to take pictures of the doctor. All this stuff is happening before they're kidnapped.Saw is a pretty good movie. They've already made a sequel to it and I think a Saw III is coming out. I give this a 7/10. Pretty good movie.",7,0,1,24 February 2006
Army of Darkness," Groovy
","Army Of Darkness, also known as Evil Dead 3, is a funny and well-made movie. Ash is transported to the year 1300 A.D. after something goes wrong at the end of Evil Dead II. All sorts of crazy and funny things happen. It's a very short movie, but that doesn't stop it from being a great movie. It's simple and too the point. Army of Darkness is just such a great movie. Bruce Campbell does a great job portraying Ash, as usual. The fighting scenes are exciting. The main villain looks like something from Spawn, the Todd McFarlane comic book. It's not as good as Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn, which I gave a 10 out of 10, but Army Of Darkness is still an awesome movie. 9/10",9,2,4,15 July 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," It's a good movie
","The first prequel, The Phantom Menace, was a dull and boring movie with a few good parts. The second one, Attack of the Clones, was an improvement, but not as good as the original trilogy movies. The third prequel, the movie I'm reviewing, Revenge of the Sith, is the best of the three sequels and is a very good movie. It's got action, drama, and it's just a good, fun movie.I love the battle between Yoda and The Emperor and the battle between Obi-Wan and Anakin. It's just so fast and visually incredible. Everyone likes a good battle between a good guy and a bad guy fighting on a lava planet(Mustaphar).This movie is good, but it has its flaws. After watching the deleted scenes on the DVD, I now realize that George Lucas made some big mistakes. He deleted a great scene where General Grievous kills Shaak Ti. If someone jumps into this movie without watching the cartoon, Clone Wars, they would think of Grievous of some sad attempt by Lucas to make a bad guy that strikes fear into everyone. Grievous is still cool, though.A lot of Jedis were killed by Clone Troopers. Seems unbelievable? Well, it happened. One of 'em got shot down by troopers before she could even brandish her Lightsaber! It's a very sad moment...I mean sad. I mean 'boo hoo sad'. Not 'crappy sad'.This was a good movie, and I feel that it's more underrated by the fans than by the critics. I give it a 9/10.",8,1,2,23 February 2006
Back to the Future Part II," Great
","This is a great movie! It's got a good storyline! It starts off from where Back to the Future left off. So Marty, Doc, and that other girl go to 2015 and stop Marty's son from going to jail. But Marty buys an almanac and Doc makes him throw it away. But Old Biff gets the almanac, uses the time machine and travels to 1955, gives the almanac to Young Biff, and when he places a couple of bets, he becomes one of the richest people ever. Thus, starts a great adventure in which Marty and Doc have to do some stuff and then stuff happens. So at the end, the events lead up to BTTFIII. You should buy or rent this movie. It's great. 9/10. This is darn good stuff.",9,0,1,25 September 2005
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Great
","This is one of the greatest movies of all time. How can you hate it? Most of the people who hate it are people who just don't get that this is more than a movie. If not for this movie, would there be a Spaceballs? No. Would there be countless spoofs and parodies in TV shows and cartoons? No. If not for this, what would be every geek's favorite movie? Lord of the Rings movies, but before that! Logan's Run? 2001? Who knows?! Star Wars is THE GREATEST cinematic masterpiece of all time. It's just excellent. I know there are people out there who hate this movie, and usually that person's favorite movie is something like Scary Movie 3. 10/10, this movie rules.",10,0,2,5 August 2006
