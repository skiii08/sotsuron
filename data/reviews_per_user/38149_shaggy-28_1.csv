Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's a bit of a rehash but somewhat entertaining.
","The Phantom Menace was entertaining to watch but just about every element in the film, except the Senate scene, was in the first three films. Granted most of the races have changed but it is still just a retread of the original trilogy. Don't get me wrong, I liked it. However, it's still the same story with some extra flair and load of hidden characters to watch for.",Null,0,1,20 June 2000
