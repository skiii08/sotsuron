Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Does not live up to the hype.
","After waiting months for Borat to arrive on DVD, after not being able to see it while it reached its peak of success, and having to listen to someone quote it at least 5 times a day for months, I finally saw it and i have to say that i am disappointed. It lived up to nothing even close to what people were praising it for. I cant say that there were not times when it was funny, but when people say its the 'funniest thing they have ever seen', i was expecting a lot more. Borat will tragically live on in quotes that will be uttered by everyone. So please, if you are reading this please stop saying the quotes, and let this over hyped bomb finally sizzle out and be put to rest.",5,0,2,11 March 2007
300," An artful master piece, in both style and performance!
","The movie is yet another masterpiece by Frank Miller, which journeys into the noir art style yet again, and is done is such a beautiful way that images from the movie could fill a museum up. The acting is splendid, and each character's personality fits his look. The emotion that each character conveys is really amazing. The epic battles are so beautiful and poetic that they will bring a tear to your eye.Overall, if you want to see just a movie go see something else, but if you want an emotional experience that will stay with you then see 300.( Noir - a cinematic term used primarily to describe stylish Hollywood crime dramas, particularly those that emphasize moral ambiguity and sexual motivation. Film noir of this era are associated with a low-key black-and-white visuals.)",9,1,5,11 March 2007
