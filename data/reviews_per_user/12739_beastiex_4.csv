Hereditary," A load of codswallop
","What the hell have i just watched?I have seen lots of bad films in my time but this is right up there with the very worst.Incomprehensible.extremely boring,bad acting and for a so called horror not one scary moment.Think the people who like this are movie snobs and see good because it has rave reviews.For the life of me i can not see why",1,1,2,29 June 2020
Wind River," Not as good as people say
",The film was good if a little slow.What ruined it for me was that i barely understood a word that was spoken.A common fault in recent movies,7,0,1,6 February 2020
Lion," So Slow
",Really wanted to like this film because of the story line.However it starts ok but afterwards takes an age towards the inevitable climax.Of coarse i shed a tear or too but overall somewhat underwhelming,5,0,0,28 April 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Bang average
",So to start on the positives this is visually stunning with a fantastic cast.But that aside this really is not a great film.No real story line just a collection of different episodes in various characters life.Overall this is quite interesting but if it wasn't Tarantino would it get such high praise?,6,3,5,2 May 2020
