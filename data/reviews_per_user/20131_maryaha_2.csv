Catch Me If You Can," Skip It!
","This movie was a waste of many things - good actors, a good director, and an excellent story/book.  I have read the book by the same name at least three times and it is funny, dramatic, unnerving, entertaining, and a downright excellent work of art.  The movie does not live up to the excellence of the book.  It is too bad because they could have made it so good.  I don't know what happened.  Hanks is not hot enough and DiCaprio is not suave enough. They should have let the real Frank Abagnale, Jr. do the acting and directing.  He is much more entertaining on his own than with these goofballs.",Null,0,0,26 December 2002
Signs," An excellent movie!
","This is a great movie!  It is clean with no nudity, filthy language, or other bad taste.  The movie is more of a psychological thriller than anything else.  There is no blood and guts, which a good scary movie does not require.  Mel and Joaquin look terrific and act even better.  The kids are cute and smart and are just...well, just normal kids.  I liked this movie a lot.",Null,0,1,16 September 2002
