The Sound of Music," One of my all-time favorites
","I just love Julie Andrews! Her voice is so clean and wonderful, and her acting superb. This movie is an all-time great. Even my young boys love this movie, and the soundtrack as well! Not only is the music catchy and timeless but the plot is great too...I love WWII history.This is one of those movies you can watch over and over and over again and still love the songs. The cast is all so attractive and perfectly chosen. The movie keeps moving...there are no dull or slow spots. It seems Julie Andrews worked well with children because she was so good in both Mary Poppins and Sound of Music. I find my own children love to watch her because of how well she interacts with the stage children on the TV.Great for kids and adults alike!",10,1,7,3 December 2007
