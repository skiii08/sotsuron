American Sniper," Heroism and the left in Hollywood
","Kris Kyle: An American HeroI have not seen 'American Sniper' but I did read what Sarah Palin said about the 'left in Hollywood'. America does need a hero; since the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. and President Kennedy were assassinated, there has been a hole in the moral fabric of America. They were the last great heroes. Khris Kyle represents what a hero is: courage, sacrifice and loyalty. All I know about the movie and the man is the basic story and that he was murdered at home, on American soil; this is his service record: 'Kyle served four tours in the Iraq War and was awarded several commendations for acts of heroism and meritorious service in combat. He received two Silver Star Medals, five Bronze Star Medals, one Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, and two Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals.[9] Iraqi insurgents dubbed him the 'Devil of Ramadi' and placed a series of ever increasing bounties on his head, purported to have eventually reached the low six figures. He became known by the moniker 'Legend' among the general infantry and Marines whom he was tasked to protect. This title initially originated in jest among fellow SEALs following his taking of a sabbatical to train other snipers in Fallujah.[10] He was wounded twice and involved in six IED attacks.' ((Wikipedia) The man who shot him at a target range is awaiting trial. The importance of this film for the American public is that it is a small beacon in a very dark world where hope is needed that there are heroes, real ones that live, work, hurt and die in the service of something bigger than themselves. I am not a Palin fan but I believe that this film threatens the 'left in Hollywood' or liberal elite because they are the part of Hollywood that contains no moral substance or fiber. I will see this film and I think that every person who believes and desires freedom and liberty should see it too as a reminder of what it means to sacrifice one's self for what one loves in a bigger and more glorious picture.
