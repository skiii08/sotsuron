Alien 3," It works 8/10
","I have always felt that David Fincher's underrated monster film, Alien 3, wasn't given enough credit.  Sure it can't hold a candle to the first two installments, or the fourth for that matter.  But that doesn't mean the film is unsuccessful in all of its attempts.  Alien 3 succeeds in being the most hardened, soulless, and overall depressing film in the series.  All of the other Alien films end on a happy ending, but with Alien 3, there is no hope. Moody and dark as hell -- this one is probably just for the fans, but I dug it.",8,8,10,14 April 2002
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Popcorn fun. 8/10
","Lets get a few things straight here, I have never been one of those film buffs who worships the 'original' trilogy.  The only exceptional film of the bunch is The Empire Strikes Back, the other ones are just perfectly fun popcorn flicks.  That is exactly what Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace is -- fun.  It's imperfect as hell, has terrible dialogue at times, and a story that is WAY too pertinacious.  I almost forgot about the little Omen in it (by the name of Jake Lloyd) who just so happens to be one of the worst child actors I have ever seen.  However, one can't ignore the pluses, and there are just enough positives to make this film a better then average summer blockbuster.First, it's hard to dislike a film that's this gorgeous.  I am a huge fan of eye candy.  I like to be transported to worlds I have never seen and that's exactly what Phantom Menace does.  It's also fun, in a silly goofy sort of way, but in my opinion, that's what Star Wars has always been about. Overall, sure it might be disappointing for those expecting the second coming of Christ.  For a movie however, it's solid and FUN entertainment that comes in the simplest form.",8,1,4,12 May 2002
Minority Report," Welcome to hell....I mean the future. 10/10
","Words can not explain how shocked I am at the sheer brilliance and subtlety of Steven Spielberg's newest masterpiece, Minority Report.  If one was to judge the trailers for the film, they would assume that it was just your average run-of-the-mill summer blockbuster that is overrun with dazzling special f/x.  This is not the case with Minority Report; a dark film noir that is bound to become a classic.  If you go expecting action scenes that rival the Mission Impossible films, you're going to be gravely disappointed.  Minority Report is something new and fresh that will reward patient and smart audience members, and  frustrate those who don't know the difference between film' and movie.'  With Minority Report, I'm with the majority who are giving it nothing but praise. The must see film of the summer.",10,0,0,21 June 2002
Fight Club," Provocative and daring -- this movie has it all! 10/10
","A daring life-changing satire on life in America.  David Fincher's Fight Club is perfect on so many different levels.  One can get something different from every viewing.  It works as a buddy flick; a satire; violent propaganda; this movie has everything!Edward Norton and Brad Pitt give the performances of their careers (so far). Helena Bonham Carter is diabolically sexy.  The real star of the film is David Fincher's exhilarating direction, and the screenplay's wicked wit.The DVD is a must.",10,0,2,28 April 2002
The Rookie," An adult film kids can enjoy; instead of a kids film that adults must tolerate. 7/10
","As predictable as a Hallmark card, but not without merit, The Rookie makes for a solid outing.  Dennis Quaid, the most reasonable jock actor working today, is absolutely perfect as the science teacher turned baseball player Jimmy Morris.  The film is never dumbed down for the children, as would be expected from a G rated film.  As a sports film, The Rookie is one of the best I have seen since Any Given Sunday.",7,1,1,4 April 2002
Alien: Resurrection," gorgeous gore 10/10
","Visually superior to all others in the franchise, but still not the best. Alien Resurrection is a joy to the eyes, and hey, it's pretty darn entertaining too.  A nice supporting cast, that is overshadowed by the grotesqueness of the production.A satisfying, never boring, wonderful film.  Hopefully not the final...",10,11,19,15 February 2002
Mississippi Burning," Sometimes rules need to be broken 9/10
","Alan Parker's Mississippi Burning is an unflinching look at racism in the South.  This is a very difficult movie to watch, but it is well worth it, and a reminder of past events -- events that should never be forgotten. Gene Hackman gives a power-house of a performance, ripping up the screen in every scene.  The film has a strong supporting cast as well, including the always dynamic Michael Rooker.Many have complained about the death-wish like final act, but the final results are completely called for and necessary.",9,34,52,14 April 2002
Elizabeth," the best picture of 98 10/10
","Elizabeth is a perversely dark film that is impossible to ignore -- or forget.  The film, clearly the best picture of 1998, is a unique epic of its kind.  It's not overlong, nor is it presumptuous.  The film has a wonderfully dark atmosphere that is rarely seen in this kind of picture. Although the film is dark, you never get the idea that it is trying too hard -- like a Tim Burton film would.Cate Blanchett is unforgettable as Elizabeth, but the real treat of the film is the marvelous Geoffrey Rush -- as her evil man servant who will do anything to protect her.A truly great film -- one of my all time favorites.",10,0,2,24 February 2002
The Mummy," duh 4/10
","Goodness, this film is as stupid as a bag full of hammers.  The movie plays more like a video game.  A dull video game, with a neat opening, and then it just gets bigger and more retarded.  A very dull summer flick.The sequel is MUCH better.",4,1,1,28 January 2002
The Natural," The best sports movie ever! 10/10
","A magical film, in part because of Randy Newman's electrifying score. Redford is pitch perfect, and the story is totally original for the time. The Natural is a sports classic.  Many film buffs, including myself, feel it's the best sports film ever made.",10,0,2,13 April 2002
Insomnia," Grade 'A' thriller 9/10
","I've seen the original, and although I don't want to compare the two films, I will say this: the American version left a much stronger impression on me then the original one did.  I don't want to comment on the story, but keep this in mind, this is not your typical serial killer film.  Al Pacino, as to be expected, is brilliant.  I actually liked Hillary Swank in this film, which I found to be shocking.  However, I was blown away with Robin Williams' creepy performance.  Insomnia has some fantastically thrilling moments, and it has enough, but not too much style, to make you want to see it again.  A surprising success.",9,0,0,25 May 2002
X-Men," How a super-hero movie should be 9/10
","Watching Spider-Man, I found myself asking certain questions like: what went wrong?  To answer some of these, I find myself turning to the surprisingly pleasing X-men.  X-Men is superior to Spider-Man for a number of reasons. First, I like the way Bryan Singer was able to take super heros and villains, and place them into the real world.  X-Men looks and feels very authentic to me, and I like that.  Spider-Man never seemed like anything but a a cartoon that magically came to life.  X-Men does the whole origin deal quickly, you get what you need to know, and you get to see a mutant trying to come to terms with her powers (Rogue).  X-Men doesn't waste time though. It quickly introduces its villains and their reasons, and quickly introduces us to the heros that must stop them.  X-Men is about 25 minutes shorter then Spider-Man, but it seems much longer because they are able to get more valuable things done in the running time.  I was never bored in X-Men, unlike Spider-Man.  X-Men was made for much less, but the CGI is much more convincing and the action scenes play out much stronger then they do in Spider-Man.  To final things off, X-Men has a strong cast, but it benefits mostly from a stand-out performance by Hugh Jackman.In closing, X-Men stands alone as a great film.  Watching Spider-Man, I found myself wondering, why can't this be more like X-Men?",9,0,1,5 May 2002
The Terminator," Relentless 10/10
",I give you one of the most suspenseful break-neck pace action films ever made.  The Terminator is an unforgettable action picture that doesn't let up until the very last minute.Wonderful action scenes; violent as hell; great performances by everyone help make this film a must for action fans.  Great score as well.,10,1,1,16 February 2002
We Were Soldiers," All around a good war film, that could have been better -- but I'm not complaining. 8/10
","We Were Soldiers may very well be put in the category of, 'Oh no, not another war movie.'  Which is a shame, because beneath some of the commonness of the film, is a film that has some brilliantly poignant moments of triumph and sacrifice.This is no Black Hawk Down.  But where Black Hawk Down had breath-taking direction, and flawless execution -- We Were Soldiers has heart.  You feel for each and everyone of these soldiers; and their wives; and their children.  These are men who made the ultimate sacrifice, and We Were Soldiers honors them wonderfully.Not a WONDERFUL film -- but a film that deserves to be seen for the story -- and the strong acting by its stars.",7,0,0,2 March 2002
Blade II," Did not know who you were messing with! 10/10
","Undeniably cool, and as of March 22, Blade 2 slashes its way to the top of all of the films of 2002.  This is easily the best film so far this year. With some of the most fantastic action scenes seen in years, Blade 2 finds itself in the same ilk as Aliens and Terminator 2. Guillermo Del Toro's latest creation is a grotesque, blood filled masterpiece that far surpasses the original.  Wesley Snipes returns as the title character, Blade.  Feeling much more comfortable then he did in the original, Snipes verifies the fact that he is the most talented action star working today.With a supporting cast, that includes a scene stealing  Ron Pearlman; enough gore to shake a stick at; amazing action scenes; and one-liners to boot -- Blade 2 is a must see for anyone who likes action.",10,2,5,26 March 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," It will make you love Star Wars again. 10/10
","Star Wars: Episode 2 -- Attack of the Clones is second only to The Empire Strikes Back in the Star Wars saga.  Filled with mind blowing special effects and action scenes, Episode 2 is without question the biggest action movie of the bunch.Episode 2's story is much more interesting then The Phantom Menace. Although the love scenes can be occasionally flat, it still works.  The real highlight is watching Obi-Wan Kenobi doing his detective work to try and solve who a certain Bounty Hunter is, and why an Army of Clones is being made.Hayden Christensen hits the mark perfectly as Anakin Skywalker.  Don't just listen to the words he is speaking, take a look at the evil glare in his eyes, and tell me that doesn't give you the chills.Overall -- this movie ROCKS.  Blowing away every Spider-Manish like wannabe this summer.",10,0,1,20 May 2002
The Bourne Identity," Amazing action picture 10/10
","The Bourne Identity will probably be the best action film of the year. There is no CGI F/X; no science fiction elements; but enough butt kicking action to spare.  For years I have been saying it is impossible to make a serious PG-13 action movie, but The Bourne Identity has proven me wrong. The Bourne Identity has the privilege of having a surprisingly excellent Matt Damon and a classy director: Doug Liman.  See The Bourne Identity, because the action genre is `Re-Bourne' with the film.",10,0,1,15 June 2002
The Thing," I worship this film. 10/10
","John Carpenter's The Thing is hands down the best horror film ever made. Not only that, but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time. What makes the movie so great?  It's hard to put my finger on it. Everything just seems to work in The Thing, it's one of the rare occasions where everything just seems to fall in place.  The film is even superior to Alien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell.  The fact that it's not only about the gore (which is wonderful btw), but it is able to create a paranoia that is unmatched in films.  A truly wonderful film that is worshiped by all horror buffs, and anyone who has good taste in films.",10,338,422,20 April 2002
Lilo & Stitch," Excellent picture...with Elvis tunes! 9/10
","Lilo and Stich is the most pleasing family film I have seen in sometime. The film is bound to be classic, it has a type of unique story and lovable characters that place it with such masterpieces as Robin Hood and Dumbo. This is a film old Walt would have loved.  Lilo and Stich isn't just a rehash of E.T. as many naive critics have said; the film takes a much different approach to a slightly similar story line.  This is the family film of the year, no doubt, and adults will love this film as much as children.  Please parents, take your children to this and not that horrendous Scooby-Doo.",9,1,1,21 June 2002
North by Northwest," Alfred Hitchcock and Cary Grant at their best 10/10
","Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest is an epic adventure that is practically flawless.  This film reminded me of the type of summer blockbuster that is released every summer -- minus the special effects.  The thing that separates this film and your average run-of-the-mill blockbuster, is how well done it is.  This might very well be Alfred Hitchcock's most confident film. See this movie and prepare to be awed.",10,0,1,28 May 2002
The Patriot," A fantastically fun revenge tale 10/10
","NO it is not historically accurate -- and no, this is not Gone With The Wind.  The Patriot is nothing more then Lethal Weapon goes to war against the English.  This is not Oscar material.  This film, is however, one giant action movie -- that is given an epic landscape.  I enjoyed this film much more then Gladiator, because it delivered in so many more ways.  Gladiator is only superior in the acting department.  The Patriot's action scenes are alive and vivid, as opposed the closed in feeling that Gladiator had.  The Patriot's finale, or the final battle to the film, contains wonderful action sequences.  This is a tale of revenge that is worth owning.Jason Isaacs damn near steals the show.",10,4,9,26 February 2002
Spider-Man," Disappointing start to a promising franchise 6/10
","The summer movie season officially starts.....with a THUD.It seemed like a brilliant choice in picking director Sam Raimi to helm the long awaited Spider-Man, but after viewing the film it seems that he may have not been the right man for the job.  It's not that Spider-Man is a terrible film, it just seems like there was so much potential that was wasted.  The film is missing that frantic energy that should be required of this type of film.  Raimi knows how to deliver this energy, see some of his previous films (The Evil Deads, Darkman).  Spider-Man is the only film I can think of in recent memory that cost 100+ million dollars yet it looks like it was made for considerably less.  The CGI in this film is absolutely atrocious.  These effects look like they came right out of the early 90's.  For a summer popcorn flick Spider-Man commits cardinal sin #1: it looks cheap.Other major problems: 1 - Laughable costume design for the Goblin. 2 - Dialogue that makes the 'yippy' from Episode 1 sound ingenious. 3 - Plot holes: how did Parker go from his Human Spider costume, into his official Spiderman costume?  We should have seen him make it. 4 - The same old thing.  Do we really need to watch Spider-Man saving children from fires?  How many times do we need to see him stop the same bland street muggers?  Couldn't the writers think of more unique ways to showcase Spidey's powers? 5 - Takes way too long to develop the dual between the Green Goblin and Spider-Man. 6 - Speaking of the Green Goblin, everything about this character needed to be expanded on.  Why is it he wants to destroy the innocents.  The most interesting relationship in the entire film, The Goblin and his son, is barely even focussed on.There were things I liked as well.  I thought all the casting choices were superb.  Thought the final battle could have used some work, but overall it had the goods.  I just wanted more from this film, much  more.  Here's hoping the sequel can correct on some of the areas this film failed.One thing is for certain, there has only been one true Marvel superhero this year, and that's Blade!  Give this franchise to Guillermo Del Toro and let him show Raimi how to do a comic book film.",6,0,0,3 May 2002
The Exorcist," The Exorcist 10/10
","The Exorcist isn't the scariest movie I've ever seen, but it's one of the most well made.  The film is a highly effective drama, that doesn't try and go for the cheap thrills of most horror films.  Instead, the film chooses a much nastier way to disturb, and does so better then almost any film ever made.  It takes its time, letting sheer dread take over; until there is no escape. The Exorcist is not for all tastes, but those who think they can handle being taken into one of the darkest depths of film -- this is for you.",10,1,2,3 June 2002
Ocean's Eleven," In Ocean's Eleven Case, More Would Have Been Better. 7/10
","Surprisingly, a much nicer experience on the second viewing; Oceans 11 really isn't as bad as I once thought.  I suppose it succeeds as a popcorn flick; although I couldn't help but wonder what might have been with this talented cast, and of course its brilliant director.  Nonetheless, the film is far from perfect, but it manages to satisfy -- in the most mediocre way possible.Andy Garcia is the standout to this all-star cast.",7,0,1,10 May 2002
Pearl Harbor," Pearl Harbor 8/10
","Delightfully overdone film that salutes old school film making.  Pearl Harbor has taken quite an unfair beating in my opinion.  No, this isn't Saving Private Ryan, or even Titanic; however, it's an epic film that's gorgeous to look at and raises the bar in action.  The attack scene is as explosive of a scene as I have ever seen.  Michael Bay gives the film a beautiful gloss, like most of his films.  The romance might be cliché, but that's love.  Overall, a worthy film that entertains, and might just do a little more.",8,0,1,3 June 2002
Hardball," how to turn endearing into shameful 4/10
","Hardball makes for an interesting viewing.  At the beginning of the movie, it looks like it's going to live up to what it looks like: a common and uninvolved story of a white guy who is trying to teach black kids how to live better lives.  You know, your stereotypical Hollywood pompous crap.The movie has its own idea of comedy.  The young kids say obscene remarks to one another, and we're suppose to think it's cute.  Keanu Reeves, playing the fish out of water, makes it even funnier with his uproarious reactions to the children's manners -- oh how funny.  And of course, what would an inner city tale be without different types of rap music blaring every five minutes.As the movie gets going, it begins to surprise.  We realize that these gifted young actors, are ACTUALLY -- gifted young actors.  When they aren't reading stereotypical dialogue from the foolish script, they are able to create likable, in-depth characters, that are fun to watch.  The film does a nice job exploring why Keanu Reeves is coaching the team -- and while Diane Lane and D.B. Sweeney are barely used -- they do help the film become something more then your typical inner city youth saga. I liked these parts, which makes the film all the more disappointing.Unfortunately, the movie does end up going back to its shameful ways.  The last 10 minutes of the film are so typical, so obvious, that you'll want to puke.  Of course the movie has to kill off one of the kids -- this wouldn't be a show about black kids if they didn't.  And of course the movie has to spell out that Keanu wasn't really showing the kids how to play baseball, but how to live better lives.  Without his presence, one of the kids ends up joining a gang.The film is offensive to minorities more so then any Hollywood film of recent memory.  After watching Hardball, I wondered how hard it would be to make 'just' a baseball movie -- instead of trying to make a film that's trying to change the world.  The message of this film: All minority kids are doomed unless you can play baseball.  Ignore your parents; ignore your teachers; make sure you have a white coach to save the day.  This is Patch Adams teaches baseball.  What a sour film.",4,10,19,25 February 2002
The Usual Suspects," a must-see 10/10
","Love it or hate it -- you'll never forget The Usual Suspects.  A wonderful puzzle of a film that only improves after multiple viewings.  Sure the twist at the end might not be completely concrete, but that's part of the film's charm.Bryan Singer's direction is visually gorgeous, giving the film a surprisingly classic feel; plus the action scenes are given a realistic touch.  The film is nicely acted -- Kevin Spacey shines as 'Verbal Kent,' but the real joy is Gabriel Byrne, who makes a wonderful leading man. Christopher McQuarrie is a brilliant screenwriter, as he would prove again with his masterful The Way of the Gun.",10,0,1,21 February 2002
Resident Evil," A hot babe and a gun...good times, good times. 6/10
","Flaws and all, Resident Evil manages to be a pretty darn entertaining picture.  This is one of the first FUN films we've seen all year -- it's heads and above trash like The Time Machine.  As one might assume -- the film is full of problems.  For an R rated picture that contains ZOMBIES, the film doesn't have nearly enough gore as it should.  Speaking of zombies -- the zombies in this picture could use some work -- terrible make-up at times.  A good amount of the action scenes are sloppy -- the director just kind of throws the camera into the carnage and the audience is suppose to make sense of it all.  The film has a lot of problems like this, but it still manages to deliver on the goods.  The film benefits from an amazingly sexy Milla Jovovich.  She makes the film work much in the same way Angelia Jolie made Tomb Raider the guilty pleasure it was.  The film also stands up pretty well when you compare it to the video games (which I myself am a fan of).  Not a very good film, but if you are in the mood for some zombie killing but a sexpot, like I was -- you probably won't be disappointed.",7,1,2,15 March 2002
The Dirty Dozen," Perfect Build-up -- less then stellar results 7/10
","I think it is a safe bet to say that if The Dirty Dozen would have been filmed in this day and age -- it would have been much better.  You have one of the best premises ever, a cast that is to die for, but some how the film makers managed to make it only average.The acting in the film is great -- John Cassavetes in particular shines. The problem with the film -- it's too silly.  The Dirty Dozen should be the grittiest, meanest movie out there; and at times it is.  But it also has some laughably cheesy scenes, and the action is very flawed and confusing. This movie has aged for the worst.  I'll probably get lynched for saying this -- but this is one movie i'd like to see them remake.",7,10,16,17 March 2002
JFK," One of the most important films ever made 10/10
",JFK is Oliver Stone's masterpiece.  This marvel of a film demands the viewer's attention and thought.  JFK has acquired years of debate and discussion -- just like the assassination itself. Whether or not you believe Stone's conspiracy theory is beside the point --  JFK will be remembered as one of the most important pieces of historical film of all time.,10,3,16,14 March 2002
The Elephant Man," Too bleak, without hope. 6/10
","And the most depressing film ever made award goes to The Elephant Man.  The film is very well done, with excellent performances all around, but the film is just too much of a downer.  Not enjoyable in the slightest, shows mankind and their worst, and their cruelty to the unfortunate.Mel Brooks produced.",6,2,40,30 January 2002
The Man Who Would Be King," they don't make 'em like this anymore 10/10
","Sean Connery and Michael Caine star in this delightful epic which has almost everything going for it.  The charisma of the two stars is fantastic, especially the always charming Caine.  Like all John Huston films, The Man Who Would Be King has almost everything -- action; drama; comedy -- and it succeeds brilliantly as a wonderful epic that will not be forgotten.",10,4,6,9 March 2002
Men in Black II," A Pleasing Sequel 8/10
","This film never assaults and never pretends to be anything more then it is: A cash cow for families who want to kill 88 minutes; families who want to laugh and be transported to a completely bizarre, and at times morbid world. Sure the film is reminiscent of the first, but it also feels sharper. There are obvious reasons why I might favor the sequel.  The worm guys are in it more.  A super sexy villainess. Men in Black 2 has a few better gags, (the locker scene in this film is much funnier then the baby delivery in the first).  And of course, who can deny the comedic genius that is Rip Torn? Here he is given much better lines.I was surprised how much I enjoyed this film.",8,0,0,6 July 2002
The Evil Dead," one of the best horror films....ever 9/10
","Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead may come off as nothing more then shockgore-horror, and who knows, maybe that's all there is.  But there is something fascinatingly good and brutal about this piece of cinema.  It's so over-the-top, it's brilliant.  A truly disgusting film -- but wonderful nonetheless.",9,0,1,5 March 2002
Black Hawk Down," Masterpiece
","This is the best war film since Coppla's Apocalypse Now.  Take the first 35 minutes of Saving Private Ryan (the only truly great sequence in that film) and multiple it by 100 for 2 hours, and you have Black Hawk Down.  The film isn't trying to develop characters, because it isn't needed.  The film isn't trying to explain the politics of the situation, because half the soldiers there didn't even know what was going on.  The film is simply there to put an audience right in the middle of a combat zone, and it succeeds where no other film has.  This film is unforgettable.  Ridley Scott has conquered yet another genre.",10,12,24,20 January 2002
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," 5/10 Overrated
","Like most movies that are 'out there', this film is drastically overrated. The movie works on some levels, because I will give it this, the music in the film is very good.  Unfortunately, my praise for the film starts and ends there.John Cameron Mitchell, yeah sure he talks funny and yeah, he does look like a girl, but what else make his performance good? Nothing.  Sure the film is perversely weird, but does that make it great? No.  As a love story the film fails, as a character portrait of a transvestite the film fails.  It only succeeds in the music.  Get the soundtrack from the library, avoid the movie.",5,4,11,22 January 2002
Chariots of Fire," bland 3/10
","Lets face it, the only great thing about this film is it's wonderful score. Can a movie win best picture because of its score?  I believe that is exactly what this movie did.  Because the entire rest of the film, with the exception to the wonderful music, IS BORING.  Dull acting, dull dialogue, dull everything.  The races are in slow motion, but the script is in slow motion as well.  The characters are not very interesting, and frankly a biography of some sort would have been more interesting then this soap opera.",3,12,23,20 February 2002
Some Like It Hot," They aren't hot, but they sure are funny! 9/10
",Billy Wilder's Some Like it Hot is a masterpiece.  Everything just seems to work in the film -- even forty years later!  Jack Lemmon plays the goofball brilliantly; Tony Curtis is a wonderful leading man; and Marilyn Monroe is an absolute joy to watch!  She's such a tease!!!Great fun for the anyone who loves to laugh!,9,6,9,19 February 2002
The Untouchables," Little fun to be had in this first-rate production 5/10
","A smile came to my face every time Sean Connery delivered, rather perfectly I might add, one of his classic racial slurs.  Unfortunately, The Untouchables is an unsatisfying gangster film that is ever-so overrated. Kevin Coster gives an astonishingly lazy performance as Eliot Ness -- in a role that is just wrong for the actor.  Sean Connery -- while perfect in his short role, is not used enough.  Ditto for Andy Garcia and Robert De Niro who just kind of blend with the background.If the film gets anything right, it's the violence.  The Untouchables is a deservedly violent film, with some nice action scenes.  The action scenes however are over-sylized at times (typical De Palma), including a laughable shoot-out that steals from Potemkin.  Add to that a soundtrack that makes ears bleed and it's overlength -- and you have a film that isn't very entertaining and barely passes the mark of being viewable.",5,1,8,14 March 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Amazing. Great. Brilliant. Best film in years? Probably. 10/10
","What an excellent movie.  Never before has a film combined action with drama so well.  I was blown away by this film.  Obviously, the film is the greatest technical piece to date, but it is also eloquently written. Great epic monologues accompany the beautiful effects.A masterpiece that must be seen multiple times.",10,0,0,15 May 2003
Enemy at the Gates," Action picture that works in every way possible. 8/10
","Curiously Joseph Fiennes has top billing in this film, but don't be mistaken, this is all Jude Law's picture.  Not a classic war film, but rather a dual between two men.  This is a picture about Snipers, and it is much more enjoyable then Tom Berenger's Sniper.  Ed Harris is terrific as the German Sniper.  The highlight of the film would have to be Ron Perlman's scenes.",8,0,2,11 May 2002
Rosemary's Baby," Devastating and Horrific 10/10
","Rosemary's Baby is one of the most diabolically evil and twisted films ever made.  The film is a masterpiece of sorts in its ability to be creepy and dangerous at the same time.  Mia Farrow shines as one of the most memorable female characters in film history.  The rest of the cast, from her jerk of a husband Cassavetes, to the smarmy Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer, are all perfect.  You'll NEVER forget Rosemary's Baby -- after all, he has his father's eyes.One of the five best horror films of all time.",10,1,2,30 March 2002
Ice Age," Lame Brain Torture 5/10
","Unlike the enjoyable features Monsters, Inc. and Shrek -- Ice Age is strictly for the kids.  This film is like a type of Chinese water torture for the adults.  The animation is easy on the eyes and all -- but the film just isn't very clever -- with the exception to the cute dim-witted squirrel.  John Leguizamo is particularly awful.Anyone over the age of 10 will not enjoy this film.",5,1,4,22 March 2002
Scream 2," I didn't scream, but I laughed in glee. 8/10
","Scream 2 is the funny and hip sequel to Wes Craven's brilliant Scream. While the film isn't quite as fresh as the original, Scream 2 still works. A few surprises and some graphically bloody killings make this a must for horror buffs.Spoiler: The most shocking aspect of this film, is its audacity to kill off the most pivotal character in the series, RANDY!",8,0,0,6 May 2002
The Silence of the Lambs," Jaw Dropping 10/10
","Even now, some years after the release of The Silence of the Lambs, the film remains to be one of the most well crafted thrillers ever made.  The way the action scenes are shot; the diabolical writing; and most of all, the undeniably strong performances; make The Silence of the Lambs an unforgettable experience.  All the Academy Awards were deserving, which is a rare occurrence.  The only problem?  Not enough of Hannibal.",10,1,1,26 May 2002
Vanilla Sky," Haunting and Unforgettable 10/10
","Like looking at a beautiful painting and not being able to turn away, Vanilla Sky is a film filled with great beauty and mystery.  Filled with wonderfully poetic lines, 'I'll see you in another life, when we are both cats.'  Beautiful shots that are heartbreaking -- the vanilla sky at the end of the film.  A soundtrack that will bring you to tears (the final song by Sigur Ros is especially chilling).  Tom Cruise and Cameron Crowe deliver one of 2001's best films.  A four star unappreciated masterpiece that deserves to be a classic.  This is some wonderful cinema.",10,0,1,22 May 2002
Tombstone," Solid American Western 9/10
","One of the best modern Westerns -- not too surprising, since the genre is almost nonexistent in this day and age.  Val Kilmer is DOC HOLLIDAY, giving the best performance of his career to date.  Kurt Russel, as usual, is able to carry the film.Sometimes the dialogue is less then impressive -- but Tombstone is an enjoyable Western, with it's share of violence and heroism.",9,0,0,31 March 2002
Bull Durham," Not nearly the classic it has been labeled. 6/10
","Bull Durham is far too quirky and aware of itself to be a classic.  It's so obvious it makes the film not nearly as funny as it thinks it is.  Take the Tim Robbins character for example.  It seems the film makers thought that the funniest thing in the world is having a pitcher that can not aim.  Sure I laughed at this joke the first few times, but about after the 20th time, it just got old.  What else wore me down?  How about Susan Sarandon's 'as a matter of fact' attitude.  Tramps are fun and all, but can you sell a premise on one?  Bull Durham doesn't seem to enjoy the game of baseball nearly as much as it's foul mouthed players.Kevin Costner is the only reason to watch this film -- he gives a fire-cracker of a performance.",6,5,14,20 April 2002
Sweet and Lowdown," You'll never forget this oddball character 10/10
","Woody Allen's best film -- it's his funniest and most tragic.  Sean Penn's best performance -- simply because he is Emmet Ray, and Emmet Ray is this movie.  The audience joins Emmet on an adventure of sorts through his enigmatic life.  This is a truly wonderful character study, on a completely fictional character.  All of the supporting cast is equally amusing -- but this is Penn's masterpiece.",10,0,0,17 March 2002
The Producers," a bit overrated 7/10
","The Producers is a loud, make that very LOUD movie.  Characters shout at the top of their lungs in a hysterical manner.  I thought the film was pretty funny, mostly the scenes with Dick Shawn.  The Producers is a very fun film, that is quite overrated in my opinion.  It is certainly not the best comedy ever -- nor Mel Brook's best.",7,3,6,9 February 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Unmistakably the simplest in the saga, but it set the pattern well. 9/10
","Now days, when I think of Star Wars, I think of insanely complicated plots dealing with politics.  Episode 4 -- The New Hope, is without question the most simple of all the films, but it is also one of the most memorable. This is not my favorite episode in the saga, so far I'm a die-hard Empire Strikes Back fan, and I am quite partial to the new Attack of the Clones.New Hope has the worst special effects and lousiest action scenes in the bunch, but it also does a phenomenal job of introducing characters and creating that Star War atmosphere we have all grown to love.  Overall -- this movie deserves to the be the ultimate American film it has become.",9,1,2,22 May 2002
Hart's War," Much better then the trailer would suggest 7/10
","I enjoyed Hart's War.  It does a few things wrong, but for the majority of the film it works.  Bruce Willis gives one of his better performances, in a surprisingly non-patriotic role.  All of the supporting cast works very well, I liked the man who plays the main Nazi the most.  He is not a typical villain, in fact, other then being a Nazi, he's not a villain at all.There is no doubt however, this is young Collin's film.  With good war scenes; some great acting; and an interesting enough premise, this film delivers on the goods.",7,0,1,18 February 2002
The Thin Red Line," 9/10 Flawed still genius
","The Thin Red Line is a war movie that would rather look at the effects of war in a philosophical sense and in an environmental sense.  The film is far from perfect, but there is just so much greatness to the film, it's impossible to ignore.  Wonderful performances, gorgeous film, and thought provoking.  A good war film that can hold its own with many movies.Many believe the film is superior to Saving Private Ryan.  I myself have always like Ryan better, but I find Three Kings and Black Hawk Down to both be superior.",9,0,3,22 January 2002
The Great Escape," What a movie! 10/10
","The Great Escape should be a movie every one has seen.  It's the definitive P.O.W. movie -- and all other films in the genre fail to compare.  It should be noted that this isn't just a Steve McQueen movie (although he is bound to be everyone's favorite character), but this is an ensemble piece with great performances by Richard Attenborough, James Garner, James Coburn, Donald Pleasence, and Charles Bronson.  Wonderful build-up, great middle, and a terrific ending.  This film is classic.  One of the best scores of all time.",10,63,100,16 March 2002
Gangs of New York," The best picture of 2002 - as of January 1st 2003.
","Now I haven't seen all the movies of 2002 yet; I still need to see The Hours, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, and all the other smaller films that will be working their way in my direction in the next few weeks.  Right now however, Gangs of New York is the film to beat for best picture of the year. Even Peter Jackson's brilliant second chapter in his Lord of the Rings trilogy, couldn't captivate me the same way as Martin Scorsese's newest masterpiece.The film isn't perfect in parts; the final act seems a little scattered, but the overall film is so grand and mesmorizing, it doesn't matter if the film is slightly flawed.  Using hardly any CGI effects, Gangs of New York will probably be the last epic of this scale made the old fashioned way.  You can see in every single frame the amount of time that was spent in making this picture.  The battle scenes are extrodinary, and all the leads give their best performances to date.  Especially Daniel Day-Lewis, who is pretty much guranteed to win the Best Actor Oscar.",10,0,1,1 January 2003
Windtalkers," Seen all this before. 6/10
","And here we are again, with yet another war film, in a year that seems to be plagued with them. Windtalkers isn't a bad film, in fact, had it been released a few years ago, I'm sure it would have been greeted with open arms by critics and audiences alike. However, Windtalkers has the misfortune of having to follow far superior and similar films: Black Hawk Down and We Were Soldiers. We've seen all this before, and with Windtalkers there is no longer the horror of war, but instead it is growing quite boring.I liked many parts of this film. The action is fantastic; Cage is great, as is the whole cast. The problem is, we've seen all this before, and it is growing tiring. Wait for this one on video, or a couple of years, when war films are no longer trendy, and you might find something special in this film.",6,0,0,18 June 2002
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," 3/10 Bring a drool cup
","The Coen Bros. are usually the most obscurely directors working today.  I say usually, because with O Brother, Where Art Thou? they went from perfecting the obscure, to dwelling in idiocy.  The film might be gorgeous to look at, but underneath the lush cinematography is a pin headed script, with dreadful performances.Many admire the film because they love the blue grass barnyard yokel music, but I have never been one to reside in the the South, so I didn't buy it.",3,2,4,23 January 2002
