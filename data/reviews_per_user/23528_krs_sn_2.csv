Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," The best outing
",I watched the movie today in 3D. There are moments of magic in the movie that simply take your breath away. Was the 3d worth it and good- answer is yes...there are many scenes in which the effects are enhanced by use of 3D technology.Geoffrey rush(barbosa) is superb as usual. Johnny Depp is his usual quirky self and Jack sparrow rocks. Penelope adds some freshness and feminity to the franchise(though I hear that she was pregnant while the movie was being filmed). There are many sub plots and little love stories within the main storyline which keep us interested.I cannot understand why the critics and other pedestrian review sites(RT) are giving the movie a mauling and ? were they paid or were they in love with skinny lizzy or orlando blooper,9,1,2,19 May 2011
Kick-Ass," how could they?
","This was easily the worst movie of 2010.What made me very annoyed was the sight of Child actors some of whom could be as young as 7yrs spewing obscenities. There were so many Garish costumes and over the top scenes signified a lack of thought and a complete inability to direct a movie on the director's part. with such an amount of Strange storyline and Poor direction and Hideous acting I could not for the life of me understand understand how someone could find this entertaining I also cant understand how review sites have given this drivel a good rating. I went to watch the movie in spite of my gut instinct telling me to avoid it,I did this because of the ratings on rottentomatoes,I wont make this mistake again.",1,17,36,20 May 2010
