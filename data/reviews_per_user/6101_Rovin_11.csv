Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Imaginative fantasy setting
","In 1988 I  waited in anticipation for this film to come out when I heard that Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck were going to be on screen with Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. A truly historic meeting. So when the movie started and we enter the Ink and Paint club right behind Valiant to see the ducks in the Lizst piano duel--I literally had goose bumps! The whole idea of Toontown was brilliant-like a cinematic mythology-and the story worked well.  I dont think of it as a comedy however---the jokes were rather few and far between. I found it to be more of a dark fantasy--as exhibited by the disturbing scene where the peaceful toon shoe gets 'dipped.' I realize that last line must sound ludicrous to those who havent seen it--if you havent, you should!  By today's fx standards the film's special effects seem flat(in most scenes)--but unlike say, Jurassic Park, it has a decent story to fall back on.Joe Dante is said to have been among the candidates to direct it. Although Zemeckis did a fine job, i think Dante would have brought more humour to it(and Terry Gilliam, more depth).A couple of points of interest: one--the novel has a VASTLY different storyline and conclusion. Second--although Felix the cat could not be enlisted for the movie(he wanted too much money), if you look closely above the entrance to the Toontown tunnel--you can see a face marking it that looks  very familiar.Overall i think WFRR created a cartoon mythology that was quite inspired--if only some more non-Disney and Warners toon stars could have been included!",8,0,0,2 March 2000
Spider-Man 2," Too much hokey soap opera--too little amazing Spidey action
","Spider-man was my favorite comics character. I did not care for the first movie--which missed many opportunities by not staying more faithful to the spirit of the comics from the early 60s,  instead trying to meld with the post-Mary Jane marriage era comics from the late 80s--and adding a soap opera 'forever love' aspect that was far hokier than anything I had ever read in the comics. Unfortunately, Spider-man 2 continues to display the same problems.Maguire and Dunst are still ill-suited for their roles. It was more obvious this time around. Parker should not be so whiney--and Spider-man should be more witty--taunting villains at every turn. Where's the fun? Yes, Parker has a bad personal life--but that should at least have been balanced by the joy he has being Spider-man, swinging through the city and catching bad guys. All this is still absent in chapter 2. Maybe if Maguire had better dialogue to work with--but I am not so sure. He has this buggy eyed look that makes it difficult to buy into his plight. I fear its a charisma issue--and he--but especially Dunst, don't have it--especially for this type of story.Perhaps the filmmakers were concerned that they needed to make the film appeal to every demographic--every generation of spider-fan, but focusing so much on Mary Jane--her career, her love life, was, I thought,  a great misuse of time. Perhaps they should have called the movie Mary-Jane. And for the middle section of the movie he wasn't Spider-man at all--and when he dons the costume again--he keeps taking his mask off(this was a particularly bad decision during the train sequence). Mild spoiler***The idea of him having second thoughts about being Spider-man wasn't bad--I could even tolerate the 'Raindrops' song though I had to keep from thinking I was watching a 1970s coming of age movie--but it was sloppily handled. A similar thing occurred in the early comics--where Parker,  out of illness, frustration and worry loses his powers--but when he comes back--the excitment and energy is palpable. In  a movie--it should have been even more so. Alas no.
**end of spoiler
Molina's Doc Ock. Never a favorite Spider-man villain for me. I imagined a European-accented voice, menacing and stern. The scene where he advises Parker to use poetry to woo...Mary Jane--really dulled the edge. The whole energy weapon subplot was lost amid the soap opera, and rather boring to begin with. X-men 2 was a far better sequel and blending of drama and action within a comic book framework.",6,1,2,19 August 2004
X-Men," pretty good if it was a made for tv flick
","I was not an active reader of the X men comic, and I am no expert on the characters. I found the movie to be more enjoyable than I expected, but it lacked the epic quality one associates with these types of films. For example: the scenes at the Statue of Liberty were very modest--not as spectacular as they could have or should have been. It was very claustrophobic--much like a tv movie of the week on Fox.In fact--that is what this movie seemed to be: made for television. It is unfortunate that Fox not only slashed the budget on this film, but also forced the filmmakers into a summer rather than Xmas release.As for the plot, without revealing too much, I will only say that the threat of mutant registration came across as rather lame. Could this idea have come about because of the budget restrictions? I would have preferred something more grand--like legislation to allow the military to use a virus to seek out and neutralize mutants. Now that would have been a threat--and Magneto's response in the film would have been more understandable. Furthermore--the Nazis are featured early in the film. This sequence was truly dead weight. It was jarring and not as relevant to the story as some may suggest. It would have been cheaper and more effective to have Magneto talk about his childhood when he is facing Xavier--or Senator Kelly. On the plus side--Sterwart and Mclellan did the best they could with their roles, but the real stars were Jackman and Paquin. They brought some emotional power to this flick--while the rest of the cast were not well developed.I understand that there were scenes removed from this film to cut the running time down--perhaps they would have improved the film, but not enough I suspect. I certainly did not find this film to be as disappointing as Batman, but it didnt soar like Superman either.",Null,0,0,22 July 2000
Sleepy Hollow," It was rather hollow
","I generally view Tim Burton movies as getting high marks on art direction and visuals--but low marks on story, character and theme. That is my view of Sleepy Hollow.It doesnt retain much from Washington Irving's story. In fact the treatment of the Headless Horseman at times borders on the ludicrous(even for such material as this). At one point Brom Bones duels rather competantly with the Horseman--and at another time Crane winds up on the back of the demon horse--and is able to get it to gallop on command. Hey--this is supposed to be a ghost not a reanimated corpse! I give Disney credit for instilling their 1949 cartoon horseman with a supernatural grace. (one nice touch though--seeing Crane atop his plough horse Gunpowder--and passing through the covered bridge--there is a very clear homage to the Disney cartoon if you pay attention).It was also nice to see Christopher Lee again--although i wouldnt consider this film to be in the same league with Hammer films--those flicks had characters and stories!Oh yeah--and one really pathetic mistake early on. Crane says something like: 'The millenium is only a few months away...' and the story is set in 1799.I think this movie might have been 'ghost'-written--certainly someone involved didnt have their head on straight--or maybe not at all.",5,1,3,26 November 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," More watchable than Phantom Menace but still bad
","Okay, it is official. The success of Star Wars and the Empire Strikes Back is due in no small part to the input of Gary Kurtz, and other people who left the franchise before Return of the Jedi was completed. This left George Lucas to make all the major creative decisions, which unfortunately, were not always good choices. The Special Edition changes were mostly not good ideas, and the Phantom Menace was awful. Just awful. Attack of the Clones is an improvement(less Jar Jar helps), but it still suffers from Lucas' unfettered direction and writing. Hales could not help. The dialogue is flat and unmemorable. The acting is uninspired, lifeless. MacGregor's Obi Wan Kenobi is good, but he is much too whiney. Christensen may be a good actor(havent seen him in anything else to compare), but he comes across very bad here. And Portman--she is wonderful to look at, but she has no charisma. C3PO is an asset, but his lines are basically bad puns. And Yoda? Well, his fight scene at the end was just ridiculous. The audience I saw it with was laughing--for all the wrong reasons. Lucas apparently does not care about continuity. It was bad enough to make Darth Vader the creator of C3PO, but to find him (mild spoiler) doing the precise job that he is purchased from the Jawas to do for the very same person in ANH is just insane. (end of mild spoiler) And the biggest let down may be John Williams score. Oh, how times have changed. Maybe JW just could not get inspired by what was on the screen, but whatever the case, the score is very uninvolving. It is quite sad to see George Lucas destroy his own reputation. This film lacks the spirit that made the original films so much fun. No, they were not high brow, but they were mighty entertaining. Sadly, AOTC was not.  I wont look forward to Episode 3, I just hope Lucas has the good sense to make the original trilogy available on DVD--without the SE changes.",5,0,0,25 May 2002
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," A well made big budget B movie that could have been much worse.
","If Cameron can do a sequel to Alien then why can't someone do a sequel to his baby?  Overall it was a well made big budget B movie with a few surprises and more skill than I would have expected. The action sequences were quite good--especially the first chase. No, the T X was not as memorable as the T-1000--but give her credit for trying. She really could take abuse while holding the same expression. 
 Granted, I did miss Cameron's epic blue steel 'look' and Brad Fiedel's music. The first Terminator was a decent low budget eighties thriller(the only flaw for me was that they cooked up the ludicrous notion that only organic tissue could time travel--which neither T2 or T3 held to). On the other hand, T2 was never what it could have been. It had the advantage of introducing computer graphics in a big action film--but its heavy handed social commentary (the children playing with guns sequence, the closing narration etc.) and often goofy out of character dialogue('I need a vacation') made my eyes roll . Cameron decided to make a nicer, friendlier terminator who discovers human emotions. Noble effort but I do not think he pulled it off. He also wanted us to believe that some good ol boy computer specialist is going to throw away his career and civilian life just because a kid, a crazy militia woman, and some guy with a mechanical arm shows up. And I cannot forgive him for missing the most obvious closing action sequence by not having a stripped down stop motion animated endoskeleton duking it out with the computer generated  liquid metal shapeshifter in the steel mill. That would have been a spectacular sequence and probably made the final terminator-father moments less hokey than they appeared.
Anyway--back to T3SPOILER WARNING
Arnold's Terminator: I thought he was less jokey than in T-2, and closer to a machine. And its fair to say that this Terminator actually succeeded (or will succeed) in completing its mission(ironically, including those of the first Terminator and the T-1000). As in T2--there were times when he came across as too human in his responses (though the first sequel did establish he was reprogrammed to adapt).  Also the conflicted cyborg/car smashing sequence was too much.Story-wise, the screenwriters evidently tried to put something into the story. The ending was brave--especially given the current international climate and new nuke technologies being discussed.
Overall it could have been much worse given hollywood's record of late, though another sequel would really be stretching it.",7,0,0,9 July 2003
Spider-Man," barely competent drama undermined by unfaithful adaptation
","There are two ways to look at Spider-man. One is as a summer escapist movie about a teenager undergoing a startling transformation from nerd to superhero. The other is as the first motion picture based on the 40 year old comic book character. In the first sense, Spider-man is a modestly entertaining summer action pic. The characters are sympathetic and there is just enough story cohesion to make the film satisfying. I didn't feel cheated, but I wasn't anxious to step in line to see it again either. The dialogue could be mediocre at times, but no worse than some other films of this genre. There were some ridiculously melodramatic touches--like the two romantic leads having lived beside each other for 12 years and never having spoken a word to each other---but overall the film delivered what it promised. And that was all.But as a longtime Spidey fan I could find some other faults with the film, changes to the accepted history, which in one case actually undermined the film as a coherent drama.Sam Raimi demonstrated that he could visualize a comic book world like no one else with Darkman(1990), although that heavy-handed melodramatic film suffered from a cruel streak--as if mocking the trials and tribulations of the tortured main character. Echoes of Darkman are found throughout Spider-man. Nevertheless, I welcomed the selection of Raimi--until word spread that he had decided that an audience could not accept that a high school science nerd in an IMAGINARY, FICTITIOUS, LARGER THAN LIFE, COMIC BOOK-INSPIRED movie would be able to come up with mechanical webshooter devices--a trademark attribute of the comic book character and every television incarnation. Instead, they would be organic--existing as part of the mutation Peter Parker develops from the spider bite. Now, one could point out that developing super powers from a spider bite is also difficult to accept, as is the idea that a man from another planet who looks completely human could fly around in a red cape and shoot laser beams from his eyes. But alas, the decision was made. High schooler Peter Parker would have to demonstrate his scientific genius by... writing a term paper on nano-technology, and prove his creative genius by being a rather skilled fashion artist and costume designer! Some Hollywood apologists counter that we could not expect any screen time to the webshooter fabrication because of the length of the movie. Nonsense. A one minute-montage would have sufficed. No audience member would have walked out in protest. But the webshooter issue is actually minor in comparison to another change in the origin story. In the comics, Peter originally had no friends, and while he was interested in girls he did not have any particular crush. The decision was made to condense his social experiences so that his later friend Harry Osbourne would be introduced from the beginning(thus removing Parker's status as a loner) , and to establish that Mary Jane Watson was his destined love(an embellishment not established in the comics until 20 years later). This latter change undermines the story of Peter Parker, devoting far too much screen time to the personal problems of Mary Jane as well as Harry, and creating an awkward moment for the film's conclusion. In the comics, Peter was always concerned that some super-villain would discover his true identity and hurt his loved ones---but the manner in which this is conveyed in the film's final moments is problematic and left some members of the audience I viewed the film with wondering: (MINOR SPOILER)  'Huh? After all that talk about how he loved her, he rebuffs her advances?'One other change worthy of note: The character of Flash Thompson is reduced to a one dimensional bully--in the comics he tormented Peter Parker but was actually Spider-man's number one fan.The cast was certainly competent, given the material they were working with. Maguire and Dunst were sufficient in their roles, although i would not say that neither of them embodied the spirit of comic book characters. Maguire's Peter Parker was sympathetic, but subdued, lacking the introspection and expressiveness of his comic book counterpart(and as stated above, wallowing too much on his relationship with Mary Jane). As Spider-man, he did not employ many wise cracks and taunts, another trademark of the comic book and cartoon persona. Dunst's Mary Jane was well played, but her interest in Peter Parker was obvious from the beginning--a very artificial love story.With the exception of the final shot of Spider-man, the FX work relied too much on computer graphics that were not always convincing, and in some cases distant, detracting from an epic feel to the visuals. The biggest design problem would have to be the decision to hide Willem Dafoe's face under an expressionless helmet rather than make up prosthetics. It detracted from the performance in a couple of key scenes. And the music was truly sub-par. Recycling the tv cartoon theme from the 1960s would have contributed more energy (although they did find a way to incorporate it into the film at one brief point). Overall, Spider-man does not achieve the accomplishment of the original Superman, nor does it fall as flat as Batman.",6,0,0,13 May 2002

The Lost World: Jurassic Park," underrated sequel to overrated blockbuster
","People who hate the Lost World but love Jurassic Park boggle the mind. The success of Jurassic Park was based on the novelty of cgi technology--and the suspense of a plastic cup filled with trembling water. It had a poor plot, weak acting, terrible dialogue. I did not expect the Lost World to be any better(and it certainly had some shameless moments, mainly the gymnastics scene)--but it surprised me on a number of fronts. Spielberg was obviously changed after Schindler's List, for he ejected the sugary formula and cutsy children that we have come to know(and I loathe) from his 90's films. Yes, we are introduced to a bonafide Spielberg urchin at the beginning--who is soon attacked by the objects of her affection. And yes, we have a simple story of good v.s. evil(which was strangely absent in JP), but with some intersting twists. Vince Vaughn's character is introduced as a hedonistic photographer, who did his stint with Greenpeace. later we learn that he is actually a member of Earth First--a much more 'enthusiastic' environmental group.The dinosaurs are presented as animals in the film(unlike the first movie), capable of defending themselves not only from the bad guys but the good guys as well. Petting a baby stegosaurus almost gets one character spiked, and the consequences for mending another dino-infant's human-derived injuries gets another good guy chomped in half. Best of all, the baby T-rex who is the focus of much danger throughout the movie gets to make the final kill! It was little ironic touches like this that warmed me to this movie on second viewing, as well as the cynical and refreshing message it delivered: If a Lost World of dinosaurs or other animals was discovered, humans would surely destroy it if they could. Pretty heavy for a saturday matinee action adventure flick.",7,0,0,14 August 1999
The Green Mile," Good--but not anxious to walk that mile again
","The Green Mile was well-made I thought, but it was too cruel and manipulative for my tastes. Darabont doesnt spread it on as thick as Spielberg though--I give him credit for that. I didnt mind the tacked on ending either--but i wonder if anyone else noticed that it is very similar to the ending of the Asphynx?Anyway--the movie's heart was in the right place.",7,0,0,30 June 2000
Jurassic Park," Jurassic failure as Frankenstein ripoff and Harryhausen homage
","I suspect that the makers of Jurassic Park inserted a subliminal message into the film like 'YOU MUST LOVE THIS MOVIE.' or 'SHUT YOUR BRAIN OFF!' or 'PLOT AND DIALOGUE DONT MATTER!' since so many people seem to be under the illusion that this is a good movie--when it has some of the worst dialogue and annoying characters I have ever had to endure, and a non-existant story structure. Dinosaurs are cloned, but we get little sense of the moral issues surrounding this. We have no sympathy for the dinosaurs, nor do we have discernable villians to hate. Hammond is portrayed as a cruel industrialist one minute(when feeding the raptors), and a Daddy Warbucks the next(the hatching of the raptor). The scientists who did the sinful deeds are in the background, and we are left with a lawyer to hiss at! Some may say the Raptors are the villians, but this insults the Frankenstein mythos(since the raptors were created by humans). If there is any discernable moral to the story it is that Alan Grant goes from hating children to 'kinda liking' them--which is amazing when considering the whiny brats he was stuck with.
But I could forgive the moral nihlism of the story if it wasnt for the hackneyed action of the narrative. A few humans running around for two hours, whining and gushing at the big dinos does not for great entertainment make. It lacked the imagination of King Kong, or the spectacle of Harryhausen's Gwangi effects work.",4,3,14,14 August 1999
