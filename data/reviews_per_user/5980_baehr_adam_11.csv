Child 44," A Masterful Book brought down from Paradise to the Big Screen.
",I don't know what to say to be honest. I was so looking forward to this film that when I saw the trailer I up and bought the entire Trilogy of the book series. I'm not a big reader at all but I read the entire first book in five days which for me is Impressive. I absolutely loved the book it is a Masterpiece and the best book I have ever read and I plan to read the other two sequels. I have now got that out of the way I shall continue on with the movie review. The cast was Superb I will say there is no denying that in any way shape or form though they weren't utilized properly besides Tom Hardy as Leo because he is the main protagonist. I also felt the story moved extremely slow which in the book it was a roller coaster of a ride. The thing that upset me the most was that they changed key plot points and since I just finished the book the day I saw the film it was fresh in my mind. I feel that the points they changed just killed it for me and as for anyone who hasn't read the book they might enjoy this film more so then I did. I would recommend skipping this and buying the book series and reading that instead which is painful for me to say because I was so stoked for this film and it was such a let down. I will say as for the action it was there in a few key points which was a hell of a lot less then the book had and also one last thing to add is most of the reviews from critics were correct which is rare. I bid you a great day.,4,12,39,18 April 2015
Train to Busan," Snowpiercer Zombie Style!!!
",OMG I just got out from watching what I believe to be the Greatest Zombie Film Ever Created. I will explain why I feel this way lol. I have seen a ton of Zombie films since 'Night of the Living Dead' all the way to 'World War Z' and in-between. My favorites up until this point were '28 Days Later' and the remake of 'Dawn of the Dead' and being the horror movie buff that I'm I take pride in knowing I have seen a lot of movies. I will now start my review. The story is about a man who is taking his daughter to see her mom on a train when a virus breaks out all over South Korea. The premise is simple which makes the movie that much more agreeable. The acting was honestly great with the three main leads played by Yoo Gong who plays the father Seok Woo as well as the daughter played by Soo-an Kim and finally the heavy hitter Dong-seok Ma who has almost as much screen time as the father. The other actors did fantastic as well. The action is where this movie shines. I mean it was honestly as if '28 days later' and 'World War Z' had a baby set in the Snowpiercer setting. The action was visceral and exhilarating. The zombie effects were top-notch and the blood was not too chaotic to the point of being unrealistic mind you this is a zombie film. The action was the Star in this film just to be clear with many scenes from 'Snowpiercer' and 'World War Z' being displayed here but what is used in better fashion in my opinion. The cinematography was Excellent and every scene both in the build-up scenes and the mayhem were shot with perfection. I didn't notice one hitch. The location they filmed in was Superb. I will close by saying that I may be biased and love Korean films ever since 'Oldboy' released but please don't let you not liking to read subtitles be the reason that you miss such a monumental film in the zombie genre pass you by so to speak. The director Sang-ho Yeon deserves an Oscar for his directing of this Breathtaking Masterpiece. The film is also at times very emotional and heartbreaking but it has some of the slickest fight scenes in a zombie film to date.,10,6,15,8 November 2016
The Maze Runner," OMG what an EPIC MAZE!!!!!
",I will start by saying that I just finished watching this movie today in IMAX and I absolutely loved it. I have seen all of 'The Hunger Games' movies and even 'Divergent' and I loved those movies as well but there was something about 'The Maze Runner' that sucked me into the Universe. I will say that I haven't read the books yet but I now intend to buy the box set after watching this movie just to read them and I'm not a huge reader at all. I loved the acting all the actors did Superb jobs especially 'Dylan O' Brian. The action was top-notch from start to finish and the visuals were Awesome. The movie I felt was just the perfect amount of time and although some people complain about the ending I felt the ending fit perfectly with what is to come in the sequel and it had me asking a ton of questions which I don't mind doing at all. I would definitely recommend this movie Hands-Down to any and all fans of the 2 movies I mentioned earlier and if you can watch it in IMAX then do so.,10,0,4,21 September 2014
The Revenant," The Indomitable Spirit of Revenge is Cold Hearted!!!!!
",Holy Smokes. I just finished watching this captivating movie a little while ago and it was Absolutely Phenomenal. I will start with the story which is about the explorer named Hugh Glass who is left for dead by a friend after a brutal bear attack in the American Frontier of 1823. The story is extremely solid especially since it's based on a true story. I did find the story dragging a few times but it doesn't take off of the score. I will now move onto the acting which was Breathtaking with both Tom Hardy and Leonardo DiCaprio playing their roles to Perfection like in every movie they have ever done prior. I must say that the two of them together make for one Hell of a powerful movie experience. The other actors played their roles just as well even though they were minor in comparison. I will now move onto the action which was if I dare say the most Savage and Barbarous Adaptation of combat during that time period which took place on the American Frontier of the 1800's. I mean it was Masterfully shot and truly one of a kind even to present day Military movies. The military movies of today pale in comparison to just how Ruthless it was back then for the men who fought. I will now move onto the Cinematography which was done by Emmanuel Lubezki which is a Master of his Arts. I mean they shot the film in both Canada and Argentina and a small part in America but the dedication it takes to travel all the way to South America for snow just to double as the American Frontier says volumes on how dedicated the cast and crew were on this film. I can't stress enough how visually stunning the shots were and how realistic it all felt and the music was on point even though it was sparse it was still Amazing. I will close with this statement and that is that you must go and watch this film. I mean it's one of the Best Films and the most refreshingly original films in terms of the cinematography and the depth of the characters will power to evoke just how Indomitable the human body and the human spirit can be when it wants something bad enough.,10,1,6,9 January 2016
Avengers: Endgame," Cash Grab!!!
",I'm a lifelong Marvel nerd. I live and breathe Marvel; with that said I'll start my review. The story picks up immediately after Infinity War with Thanos decimating 50% of all life as they try and rectify it. The cast was good though I honestly felt it lacking in conviction besides Tony Stark. The action was lackluster as heck. Endgame is 30 minutes longer then Infinity War and had maybe a fourth of the action runtime that its predecessor had prior. Disappointing battles minus one which lasted all of but a few minutes. The comedy was Endgames only saving salvation to be honest. It pains me to write this because Infinity War was the best superhero movie since sliced bread for a culmination movie. Average at best for me. They should have stopped after Infinity War though I know the comics wouldn't have it. I personally thought it was a cash grab. I'd say watch it once absolutely but don't believe the hype. Endgame makes Age of Ultron look good AF.,5,7,13,26 April 2019
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Imax is the way to go!!!!!
",I just gone done watching the IMAX premiere of 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' and it was SUPERB. I won't put any spoilers in here but it is def the best Spider-Man movie to date. Marc Webb is really coming along in his directing of Spider-Man and did an Amazing job with casting especially casting Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn or AKA 'The Green Goblin' which BTW is my favorite villain of all time. Anyways the acting was excellent as well as the story if you pay attention there are a ton of references to a ton of stuff in the universe. The action was top-notch in every way possible it blew the 1st film out of the water in that respect and I can't wait for the next film. In my opinion as an avid Spider-Man fan and not being biased being that Spider-Man is my favorite superhero it is a must see movie hands down!!!!!,10,22,60,1 May 2014
Jurassic World," Pratt+Blackwater+Dinosaurs= A Masterpiece
",OMG I don't even know where to start. I will start I suppose by saying this is in my opinion the Best movie in the series thus far and I know there will be a debate about this but that is how I feel. I watched it in IMAX 3D. I will start with the story which is basic it's about the park finally being opened to tourists after twenty plus years and everything going to Hell. I loved the pacing of the movie though because it doesn't just start with guns blazing it's a slow sizzle to some Fantastic set pieces in cinematography. I would also like to note that they had everything you would want to see in terms of tourists interacting with the park and enjoying it before the fun begins. I would compare it to '28 Weeks Later' and them settling down before the Zombie outbreak starts. I will move on to the acting which was very well done Chris Pratt killed it as Owen and was by far the star of the movie. I also have to mention Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire and also Vincent D' Onofrio who played Hoskins. I also enjoyed the banter between the brothers in the movie. Overall they all did a wonderful job of bringing life to the movie. I will now move onto the final part which is the action. I absolutely fell in love with the action set-pieces they were utilized perfectly and not overused. I can only compare it to Godzilla 2014 in terms of fight scenes between the Dinosaurs. I must say that once Blackwater or AKA InGen soldiers came into the mix I was sold. I will say this without spoiling anything that they had a nostalgic scene with Raptors just like the scene in 'The Lost World'. I will close by saying that if you are debating on watching this movie just GO and watch it and I guarantee that you will love it. The final fight scene was Phenomenal.,10,101,171,13 June 2015
Logan," A Majestic Seranade To All Fans.
","I will start by saying that this is my new all time favorite superhero film ever created and this is the first time it has changed since the 2002 version of Spider-Man. I mean 'Logan' had it all. The story takes place in the year 2029 with a bruised and battered Logan trying to make a living while helping out an aging and decrepit Xavier. The story then turns towards Logan being tasked to help X-23. I will stop there as to not spoil anything in the least. I will continue onto the acting with both Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and Patrick Stewart as Xavier giving the most awe-inspiring performances of their careers as these characters which have been 17 years in the making since their on-screen adaptations have emerged. The newest star Dafne Keen as Luara/X-23 did an outstanding job and Boyd Holbrook as Donal Pierce was a BADASS. The acting all around was a Masterpiece. The action is what most people are going to go and watch this movie for in my opinion and it doesn't disappoint. The action is gritty, gore-filled and gratuitous and I may add that it had a sort-of mesmerizing effect throughout the entire movie. The action was enthralling and the fact that most of it was done without the use of CG makes it even more fascinating. The cinematography is uncompromising and very surreal and each shot is done with such integrity for the craft that it can't help but be noticed thanks to James Mangold. I will close by saying this is a Must-Watch film. The film is filled with subtle nuances and nods to the old while bringing what is surely to be the new to the forefront. The film has a good amount of humor and also a heartfelt embrace that is soon never to be forgotten for as long as you live. P.S. IMAX is the Pinnacle POV to enjoy this film to the fullest in my opinion.",10,1,5,2 March 2017
Sicario," True Crime Juarez Style!!!!!
","OMFG. I can't emphasize enough in this review how much I absolutely loved this movie. I just finished watching this movie at 10pm and I had to get this review out ASAP. I will start with the story which is cliché but it's also indomitably told in real time. I know a handful of movies that use flashbacks to tell the story but this one doesn't and I enjoy that fact. I will say this much about the story that it's about an FBI agent tasked with helping a non-disclosed agency take down a Cartel. I will now move onto the acting which brought there A-Game for sure. The cast is incredibly strong with Emily Blunt,Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro being the main three characters. They are all fascinating but Del Toro in my opinion blows the movie out of the water with his character. They all have fantastic rapport. I will now move onto the action which while this isn't a Michael Bay movie the scenes that do take place are on point with excruciating detail that it boarders realism. The scenes are violent and bloody and are meant to invoke a certain feeling of awe and dread simultaneously. I must also talk about the cinematography which was done by Roger Deakins who is a mastermind when it comes to the angles and etc of the film and it's absolutely Phenomenal in every aspect and it brings the movie to life and the sounds of everything in the movie from the gunfire to the city aspect will leave you transfixed onto the screen. The banter between the characters including the Delta Force Operators is impeccably done. The director Denis Villeneuve was terrific and I applaud him for such a powerhouse of a motion picture. I will finish by saying this is my new favorite movie of 2015 which prior was 'Mad Max: Fury Road' but this takes the whole bakery. I would recommend watching this movie without a doubt. A Masterpiece rapped in a bow.",10,2,6,1 October 2015
Edge of Tomorrow," The Best Tom Cruise Movie To Date in my opinion!!!!!
",I will start out by saying that I saw this movie in IMAX 3D and I absolutely loved it. I will begin by saying that I love Tom Cruise as an action actor and that he is def in my Top 5 actors of all time. Now to the review. Acting: I will begin by saying that the acting was top notch of course we have Tom Cruise who is Awesome and also Emily Blunt who was Fantastic. I thought the standout was Bill Paxton who was hilarious in the movie and also Brendan Gleeson who was also great with the few parts he had so acting was Superb. Story: The story I thought was very well put together about the alien Invasion and by the end of the movie while there was still one question it was pieced together nicely.Action Scenes: The action in this movie was Insane it was honestly non-stop from start to finish which I love for a movie like this take all the examples you have seen which combine Starship Troopers and the first scene in Saving Private Ryan and combine them and that is what you get an all out brawl of badass action scenes to rival these movies in particular which are Battle:LA and Battleship which I didn't watch because I heard it sucked but regardless if you love action movies this is def for you.Verdict: I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves comedy and action movies galore. I would say watch it in IMAX but if you can't just watch it in 2D this is the summer blockbuster to start the summer and possibly beat out all the rest and in my opinion is Tom Cruise's best film since my personnel favorite 'Collateral'!!!!! A Must See.,10,0,2,5 October 2014
Hacksaw Ridge," Heroes Never Die!!!
",Wow I just watched this movie the other day and it was Insane. I will start with the story which is about Pfc. Desmond Doss who won the Congressional Medal of Honor for saving 75 men in the Battle of Okinawa during WW2 for those who don't know their history. The story is executed perfectly in the roughly 2hr and 15min movie. The first half shows his life and boot camp and the second half the Battle at Hacksaw Ridge. The movie is based on a true story as well which makes it that much more grounded. The acting is tremendously Superb. I mean Andrew Garfield killed it lol. No pun intended. I know some people don't like him but he was great at portraying a convicted individual who's beliefs were being attacked. The other three standouts were Capt. Glover played by Sam Worthington and Sgt. Howell played by Vince Vaughn and finally Tom Doss played by Hugo Weaving. They all were Impeccable in their acting. The action was honestly some of the most Intense I have seen in a Military Movie to date and I have watched a ton of Military films and I have studied military history. The depiction of the battle of Hacksaw Ridge was very authentic and extremely heart palpitating. The Japanese were and are in my opinion the greatest threat that Americans have ever faced in battle. They were extremely formidable and were not afraid to die at any given second. I digress but the battle was bloody and full of shock value but not unrealistic by any sense. The cinematography was honestly perfect in every shot and frame. I will close by saying this is honestly the Best Military movie I have seen to date including in my opinion surpassing 'Saving Private Ryan' and Mel Gibson as always is a Beast of a director. I was honestly in tears at the end of the movie when they showed the real life interviews of the actual heroes of that real life event. Go and Watch this movie.,10,10,19,7 November 2016
