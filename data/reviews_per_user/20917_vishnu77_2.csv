The Blair Witch Project," It wasn't the scariest movie ever made...
","I didn't really want to see this movie to begin with. I'll be very honest. I wanted to go see 'Runaway Bride.' But I did go to see it and was really angry that I had paid money to do so. I thought the actors were quite good, especially Heather Donahue as the obsessive film-maker. I thought the concept was excellent. Even the idea that you couldn't see what got them was cool. My main problem was this: even in old horror movies where you didn't see the advancing killer entity, you could still see the reactions on the faces of the people it was going to get. As far as reactions, all you saw in 'Blair Witch' was them running with the camera still on. You heard the screaming and saw them getting freaked out but that was pretty much it. I'm more interested in the reaction rather than the action. And as such, I really can't say I enjoyed this movie. And no way was this movie scarier than 'The Exorcist' or 'The Shining.' If grown men were unable to sleep after seeing this, then they should talk to the psychologist from 'The Sixth Sense.'",Null,0,0,9 August 1999
Notting Hill," One of my favorites....
","I had the chance to see this movie last year at the test screening. I went in only knowing that Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant were in it. That's all. I walked out loving it. Now that it is being advertised, I can say that the commercials don't even begin to scrape the surface of this film. There have been so few genuine love stories lately that this is sure to take its rightful place among the great romantic comedies. It does answer a question sometimes wondered by non-celebrity and celebrity alike: How do you find someone out there who wants you for you? How do know when someone wants you simply because you're famous instead of for the person underneath? And how do keep the media away? It's a funny movie, with that dry British wit and the American savviness. It's a wonderful look at love and the battle to make a relationship work under extraordinary circumstances. There's nothing I would change about this movie. In particular, I loved the roommate, Spike. But this movie will endear its way into your heart if you've ever fallen in love, with someone who knew or someone who never knew.",10,2,2,20 May 1999
