10 Cloverfield Lane," this is how you do tension..
","10 Cloverfield Lane is 2016's biggest surprise, nobody knew we were getting a sequel to Cloverfield, but really we never were. This film carries the Cloverfield name but it actually has nothing to do with Cloverfield. None of it is filmed with hand-held cameras and honestly i found myself a lot more entertained by this one. I like the first film a lot, but this is a different film entirely and it really benefits from it too.The film follows Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character who is involved in a terrible accident, but is 'rescued' and finds herself captive in a bunker with Emmett played by John Gallager Jr. And Howard, a man who doesn't seem like the person he says he is, played by a creepy but incredibly well acted John Goodman. He tells her that she can't leave the bunker because the air outside is toxic and that they will all die, but is this as accurate as he says? Honestly the cast in this film is great. John Goodman has done some brilliant films and i love him as an actor, but i have NEVER seen him like this before. There are scenes where you feel bad for him and you want to really like him and then he does something where you're thinking 'who the hell is this guy?!' There was more than one occasion where i jumped out of my seat and the tension really had me gripping the sides of my seat because it was so well done. There is a scene quite near the end where something happened and my hand instantly went to cover my mouth and i stayed like that for at least 5 minutes because it shocked me so much, there is no build up, it just happened. Most of the scenes that take place in this bunker have an air of tension to them, even when John Goodman is wiggling his backside to music on his jukebox i thought, man this guy is hiding something. It is really easy to put yourself in the shoes of Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character because it almost makes you feel like you are trapped in this bunker with the three characters not knowing who to trust. A lot of people have issues with the ending of this film and yeah, i don't really know how to feel about it either. It happens, the film ends and you're sort of sat there like 'hmm.. okay', i don't hate it like a lot of people do, but i see what they're getting at and it could have been handled a little better. But all in all, this is one of the best films of 2016 so far. The last 15-20 minutes are straight up tension fuelled madness and my heart was racing. I'd say watch it a few times because the ending may make more sense which is why i am going to see it again, but this is a highly enjoyable, intense thrill ride which needs to be seen",9,0,2,19 March 2016
Catch Me If You Can," Unlike it's main character, this film is exactly what it wants to be!
","There are a lot of classics i have been wanting to see but haven't got the chance. I have had a lot recommended to me, whilst i watch a hell of a lot of movies i haven't seen them all. I recently got my hands on a copy of Catch Me if You Can and had high hopes. Afterall, i've heard nothing but praise for the movie and the two main stars Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hanks are two of my all-time favourite actors, how could i not love this?! So i watched it.. and i love this film! It had me hooked in from beginning to end and I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. It was a fun movie as well as one that just keeps you wanting to know more and guessing how it will end for the characters.. especially Leonardo Dicaprio's Frank Abangale Jr.The plot follows Frank who leaves home at 16 after his parents divorce and poses as a pilot.. then a doctor.. then a lawyer.. all before he turns 21. I tell you, this guy has lived. Hot on his tail is an equally brilliant Tom Hanks as FBI detective Carl Hanratty who figures out Abangale's tricks through a series of fake cheques he is cashing out. This leads to an entertaining cat and mouse type movie full of twists and turns. The two actors play off of each other perfectly and are two completely different characters. What i like about Leonardo Dicaprio's portrayal of Abengale is that he is an incredibly smart guy and he is so good at showing this without completely overplaying himself. Christopher Walken also does great as Abengale's father and adds some moral backbone to the twists and turns and we get a young Amy Adams who is also great as Abengale's love interestEverybody in this film does great.. in fact.. even a Jennifer Garner cameo was awesome!In the end, from the fitting music in the soundtrack to the animated opening sequence to the climax of the film everything was almost perfect and i will be watching this film a lot more times in my life because i had a great time and it really showcases why these 2 actors are 2 of the best working today. It comes highly recommended with the perfect blend of humour and entertainment.. if you haven't seen Catch me if you Can then see it now!",9,2,3,13 April 2015
John Wick," this is what action films long to be...
","Retired hit-man? Check. Actor who has lost his way with the public after a successful franchise? Check. Fun, entertaining and utterly badass? Double check. Don't let the trailers fool you into thinking this is in the vein of the bad slew of action films we have had recently with actors like Arnie, Sly Stallone and Liam Neeson trying to get back on form, John Wick actually succeeds in being everything it wants to be and everything its audience wants.. and Keanu Reeves kicks serious ass as the title character. Word of advice.. do not mess with John Wick.The plot follows John after the tragic death of his wife who leaves him a puppy as a last gift to help him cope with the loss and to make sure he isn't alone. When Russian mobsters try to buy his vintage car and he refuses they get mad and decide to kill his dog. This sets John off on a revenge rampage and brings him out of retirement to take out everyone who took everything from him. As a dog lover this was hard to watch, but seeing Keanu Reeves mow down rows of mobsters will never get old. This film could have easily been like other action films today with a mediocre plot stretched over 2 hours expecting to be loved. It knows what it is from the get go and after a slightly slow opening we are given a treat for action fans and a real guys film (not that women cant also enjoy this). Aside from Keanu Reeves, Willem Defoe is in this film. Recently it feels like Willem Defoe is still being used to throw in to minor roles in films for the sake of it.. but for him it works, so props for that. We recently saw him in both 'The Fault in our Stars' and 'The Grand Budapest hotel' but in both films whilst he could have been played by almost anyone.. he was significant and great like he was in John Wick. At first he almost felt like Jason Statham in Furious 7, popping up when he was needed to be a threat to the main character (which isn't such a bad thing) but he becomes more than this which was cool to see.But the show is very much Keanu Reeves own and he knows this. The dialogue was delivered well from him and whereas he was a badass in The Matrix.. in this film he was a million notches above Neo. Every action scene felt like a video game in the best way. The nightclub scene was particularly pulse- pounding and made me feel right in the moment. It is guaranteed that any scene featuring John Wick and a room full of bad guys is going to be beautifully stylised and absolutely absurd. I can see this being a nice, small franchise which could work way better than something like Taken and it would be cool to see John's back-story unravelled. In the end i enjoyed this movie a hell of a lot and for any fan of action movies this is a must see. Keanu has never been better.. Just never mess with his life. If he is anything like John Wick then i feel sorry for anyone that attempts it.",8,4,9,12 April 2015
Creed," a real heavyweight knockout of a film..
","I want to be honest and make this review clear.. i have never seen a Rocky film. Judge me if you will, but i just never got round to it. That being said i know of other work by Sylvester Stallone and from what i have seen this is actually his best performance yet.The film follows Addonis Creed, who wants to make a name for himself instead of simply following his father, Apollo Creed's legacy. Rocky Balboa takes him under his wing and trains him under the name Johnson to be a champion in his own right, but when Rocky gets sick they both have to fight their own battles. That is what sets this film apart from other boxing films, it is more than that. A fighting film yes.. Rocky fights out of the ring this time though, which made him that much more compelling to watch. Michael B Jordan once again proves himself as the leading man. He went from being in the worst film of 2015 to giving a real knockout performance, if you'll mind the pun. We get a good insight into what both of these characters are going through and they play off of each other so perfectly.So why do i call this Stallone's best performance? Well firstly, he went from adding some hilarious humour to the film, to bringing me to tears. You feel like he is in this for Creed. He says he is ready to embrace death, yet you see in his eyes and in this brilliant performance that he really wants to see Donnie succeed and become everything his father was and more. The cinematography also stands out really well. From Donnie's first fight you knew it was something special. I knew this was the scene that was done in one shot and it looks amazing. We follow Creed and his opponent as they are throwing punches and evading them. It makes us as an audience feel we are right there in the ring dodging blows. This carries through a few times and the last climatic fight is a spectacle to behold, especially when that iconic Rocky theme blares from the speakers. It put a huge smile on my face. There are more than a few times that i teared up at this movie too, especially at the heartwarming ending that really shows how far Rocky, as well as Donnie, have come as champions.So does it make me want to watch the Rocky films before this? It sure does. I am going to now spend the time to watch them all and get to know these characters as well as i got to know Donnie and i am looking forward to it. I was on the edge of my seat by the end, but as i said this film has a hell of a lot more to offer than just the boxing.",9,1,5,16 January 2016
Spotlight," shocking.. yet captivating
","Spotlight follows a team of reporters as they unravel a string of accusations against priests and how they have been accused of molesting children. Now a film like this runs the risk of leaving a bad taste in the mouth or even being tedious and boring. The film we get does neither of this, it opened up a number of doors and captivated me as well as equally making me feel disgusted, but none the less is a solid and very good film. The main cast give it there all. Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton take centre stage and play really well together, almost as opposites, but they both have such a strong presence in scenes that you really feel like you are right there with them unravelling this string of clues, it feels almost harrowing to be in the situation but at the same time you can't help but take in the story and it is almost impossible to think about anything else. If a film like this can do that for me, then kudos because it really succeeds in making a film which could have been drab and gloomy into something you are incredibly interested in. Rachel Mcadams also stars and does a brilliant job, she is the person in the film that i think i connected with most because she is so likable but at the same time so genuine and real in the role and it was refreshing to see her do something so different because she is a wonderful actress. Liev Schrieber also gives a strong performance, but isn't as easy to connect to because he isn't in the film a huge deal.I'm really glad to see Michael Keaton is back for good, i didn't really see him in much since Birdman, but he proves he is still as brilliant as ever here. The fact this film is based on a true story is extraordinary. The events that take place here are set in one location but by the end it is shocking when we are told how many places in the world actually had these allegations. It is unbelievable and the film does a brilliant job at spreading awareness for such a tragic subject. I highly recommend you see this film. I mean the last two films i saw before this were Ride Along 2 and Dirty Grandpa. It is safe to say i am relieved to see a film with actual quality and i hope this one cleans up at the Oscars, it is well deserved.",9,1,2,31 January 2016
The Hateful Eight," Tarantino is back folks.. that's all you need to know
","Quentin Tarantino is among the finest of filmmakers working today, i would go as far as to say Tarantino is the best director of all time. I will keep the description of this film vague because i went in vague and i was hugely surprised at the outcome. We follow two bounty hunters played by Samuel L. Jackson and Kurt Russell who meet by chance during a blizzard. We also have Jennifer Jason Leigh who is a prisoner that is being taken to her death to be hung. They take refuge in a cabin whilst the blizzard dies out with 6 other strangers. So you now have these 8 characters and we are left to unravel the mystery within.Do not go into this film expecting a fast paced western, in fact don't even go in expecting to see something similar to Django Unchained because this is very different. As a fan of Tarantino i knew that we would be given a lot of dialogue, the dialogue here is so captivating that it puts you right in this time period with these characters. But when something happens.. oh boy it becomes a tense thrillride. There is one scene in particular towards the end, where i literally rose to the end of my seat because i had no clue as to who was going to make it out alive. I like films where you don't know what is around the corner and where you have to keep guessing even when a scene is happening. The Hateful 8 is no exception.What i also like is where you have a cast of characters that you at times want to root for, but who are also unlikable. Literally none of the characters we face are likable.. they have all done terrible things. Kurt Russell in this film is a mega douche but does his job so well and Jennifer Jason Leigh is a character who you really want to dislike but can't. It was nice to see Samuel L Jackson in this film as the main character, if there were a 'hero' it would be him, but he has still done things that are terrible. Tim Roth for me was a real standout, he is the most likable, but is so shady at the same time.In the end, what can i say, it's Tarantino. He takes these situations and throws us right into the mix. It was captivating, fun and gruesome. The last act is pure Tarantino blood and guts carnage, but for all the right reasons. The soundtrack was one of the best I've heard in recent years, especially the opening track which continues throughout the film and you can see where 70mm film is used because it also has a very unique look about it. It proved itself as the best film of 2015 next to the Force Awakens and i highly recommend anyone who loves film see it. I can't wait to see what Tarantino throws at us next.",10,5,17,9 January 2016
Southpaw," Manages to depress you and raise your spirits over the course of 2 hours..
","Southpaw drinking game, take a shot every time you hear Jake Gyllenhaal say 'Baby'.. seriously try it, he says that more than Vin Diesel says the word family.Southpaw follows Billy 'The Great' Hope, another powerhouse performance from Jake Gyllenhaal. He has been on a role recently, especially with his role in Nightcrawler, and his performance in this film certainly doesn't disappoint. Hope is a boxer who is at the top of his game, he is the reigning Light Heavyweight champion and seems like an unstoppable force. After a fight breaks out between him and a rival boxer, Hope's wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) is shot and killed. What follows is a downward spiral in his life including the loss of his wealth, his manager and even his daughter. An ex boxer played by Forrest Whittaker seems like his only hope at getting back in the ring and gaining his life back. Now, the plot is very simple and it is something we have seen before, the whole cast however, especially Gyllenhaal and Whittaker draw us straight in. Southpaw has a VERY slow start. Don't go to this film expecting a straight up boxing film because that isn't what you will get. When we get to see the boxing action it is great, especially the intense last fight, but Southpaw is more a film about loss and redemption.If that sounds good chances are you will find a lot to like about this film. Gyllenhaal manages to be likable even at the times you don't feel like you should like him, heck even 50 Cent as the Don King-like douchebag manager who only cares about himself manages to have a likability about him which is hard to pull off. Feels kind of horrible to say this is a film.i enjoyed because its almost like me saying i enjoyed seeing a man lose everything.. but in fact what i enjoyed more was his path to redemption and seeing him gain it all back over time because Hope can be a relatable character. You see that he has become the man he was before and is capable of looking after his daughter afterall and seeing how he interacted with Rachel McAdams before the film kicked off helped us see this. In the end, the boxing was great, the cast was stellar. As much as Jake Gyllenhaal deserves an Oscar nomination, if he didn't get one for Nightcrawler he wont get one here. Not a perfect film and at times its hard to get in to, but well worth the watch.7.5/10",7,1,3,3 August 2015
Ant-Man," Smaller scale but heroes.. and films, don't get any bigger!
","I have been following Ant Man since Edgar Wright was set to direct as i am a massive fan of his work. Then he left the project. I was worried Ant Man would just get lost in two different screenplays as i heard Wright's work was still being incorporated in, plus not knowing enough about the character from the comics.. But there really was no need to worry. The film turned out better than i could have hoped and even trumped my expectations. Paul Rudd does a great job and brings his all to the role of Scott Lang, a thief who has just come out of jail after three years. Over at Pym Tech Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) is developing a formula to mirror Hank Pym's (the original Ant Man) and to create a new breed of soldiers called the 'Yellowjacket'. Pym recruits Scott Lang as the new Ant Man to pull off a heist which will save the lives of millions.. and that is pretty much our movie. Michael Douglas plays Pym in this film and he really does it so well. Every time he was on screen he was a blast to watch and listen to and the father/daughter dynamic and storyline between him and Hope (Evangeline Lilly) without giving spoilers, was great to see. When Pym is training Scott to become the new Ant Man, that was so fun to watch and you can tell Paul Rudd and Michael Douglas had a great time working with each other. I was sort of worried at first that the shrinking and growing repeatedly during fight scenes would get on my nerves as at first it takes a while to adjust to (especially in 3d), but i actually liked that a lot and loved seeing the scenes where Scott was training with the ants when he is small.Speaking of the ants, they were brilliant. The way they are introduced by Pym seemed ridiculous to me at first but i loved watching them. Seeing Scott interact with them and fly around on them, it was so cool and something we haven't previously seen in any film. Marvel aren't very strong on villains and we have known this as it has been shown countless times. Villains like Abomination, Whiplash and Ronan have always felt weak and just as if they were made to serve as a plot device. I loved Corey Stoll as Darren Cross/Yellowjacket though. I mean, he is sort of introduced as a villain to start with for not much of a reason but unlike most MCU villains he was expanded upon. When he actually put on the Yellowjacket suit, that was great and something that felt fresh, to see him as well as Ant Man duking it out whilst growing and shrinking and throwing objects that are three times their size. The climax featuring none other than Thomas the Tank Engine was one of my favourite fight scenes in the entire Marvel series. In fact, there is another fight featuring a well known Avenger that you probably know of, but just in case you don't i wont reveal what it is, but i loved that one as well.Michael Pena also gives a standout performance. These films feature a comic relief character a lot of the time, but if it works then don't fix it. Every time he was on screen i was laughing and i thought he did a very good job. Anyway,to wrap it up, i enjoyed Ant Man so much. I loved the scenes with Scott kicking a$$ as Ant Man, i loved Michael Douglas, Yellowjacket was awesome.. i don't really think i saw any flaws with this one. If Marvel continue to give their lesser known characters such good films then i am definitely on board the same way i was with Guardians of the Galaxy. Plus their are two post credits scenes which i loved. Really gets me excited to see not only Ant Man's future, but the future of the whole MCU. Another great film and i haven't given this rating since Age of Ultron, not because i'm a fanboy.... but because i know good entertainment and if a film entertains me as much as Ant Man does, it deserves this high of a rating.🐜",10,4,15,17 July 2015
The Revenant," A spectacle to behold and an amazing story..
","Leonardo Dicaprio.. wow, he has literally no competition this year, the Oscar is practically in his hands and it is very well deserved. The fact that this film is based on a true story truly amazes me. Once again a reminder of why Dicaprio is my favourite actor of all time.He stars as Hugh Glass, a man who loses everything and is left for dead by his own men after being mauled by a bear. The film played out very differently to how i was expecting, for example scenes with Glass aren't very dialogue based at all, but i really liked this. It gave a better sense of emotion and let us relate to him in an almost eerie way. We go on this journey with him and we feel isolated with him which makes the film so compelling and reminds us that this is man who has suffered through everything on the way. Tom Hardy also gives a really good performance. We have seen him in a lot and each time he is very different, this film is no exception. I really hated his character, which made the performance so great. Even when he played villains such as Bane i didn't feel such a villainous nature to the character, but here he is such a horrible person that you cant help but get sucked in to the performance he gives.Making this film itself must have been a huge challenge. I heard a lot of crew left the project and i can see why. Also, the film is very gritty and realistic meaning there are scenes that are flat out hard to watch. The initial scene with the bear that i mentioned is so intense and it doesn't stop there. The film is slow, but not in a boring way. It is slow because its a character study on Glass' part and the amazing performance we get makes it the compelling type of slow. But when there is an intense scene, all notches are turned up 100% and we do not know where things are going to be heading. I never actually read up on the story itself, but that meant i was on the edge rooting for his survival the whole time and not knowing how things would end. The way things do end though are so clever and satisfying that it was worth the wait to see.As the Oscars approach i have to say, i see this film getting a huge number of them. Dicaprio's long overdue Oscar is in the bag and between Tom Hardy and Sylvester Stallone there is a heated competition. A heartbreaking at times, heartpounding at times type of film that is one of the best in a long time. The hard work put into this film was well worth it in the end.",9,0,2,16 January 2016
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Solid proof Tom Cruise is one of the best action stars out there...
","What is it with franchises that were once forgotten coming back and getting better with each installment (usually the fifth)? Fast and Furious did it.. now Mission Impossible is doing it. I'm not complaining, but wasn't there a time when they would get worse?Mission Impossible: Rouge Nation follows on directly from Ghost Protocal and like Avengers: Age of Ultron did, it starts us off with a spectacular action sequence that sets the scope for the rest of the film, also proving to us that Tom Cruise is one of the best.. if not THE best action star working today. I mean seriously, the dude does all of his own stunts, in the last film he climbed up the tallest building in the world, in this one he literally hangs off of the side of a plane that descends 500 feet in the air. This happened for real, the dude's life insurance must be through the roof. So this time Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and the IMF are tracking down a rogue group called 'The Syndicate' which is believed to be a myth. The action is ramped up to an all-time high here. I loved Rebecca Ferguson's character, she was a better character than the actual villain and really excels the plot further and has us guessing. From her first encounter with Hunt you aren't really sure if she is a villain or there to help him. Even by the end this almost remains a mystery. As well as this, Simon Pegg returns as Benji. Loved him in the previosus installment and i love him here. He adds a dose of humour to the film and has some great standout scenes. It really shows us Simon Pegg can take on any role and still be himself, yet make it memorable and great to watch.Jeremy Renner and Ving Rhames also make a surprisingly good duo and i was entertained seeing them on screen together for all the time they had. I have also never seen Alec Baldwin have so much fun. The film takes a slow turn at certain points, not really a big complaint as these slow turns explain plot details which are obviously important, but when there is action it never disappoints. The scene that takes place in the opera and the underwater scene from the trailer were highlights, the latter putting you right in Hunt's position and throwing suspense right in there. Seriously that scene was INTENSE.In the end, Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation is a solid entry to this ever improving franchise, i came here to have fun, and i had a hell of a lot of fun. I love watching Tom Cruise do what he clearly enjoys and he must be doing it right because judging by what other people have seen they do too. Would i recommend this movie? Hell yeah i would. From the opening scene where we hear the familiar theme song the film is a fun ride that doesn't stop and i cannot fault it for that.",9,0,1,4 August 2015
Captain America: Civil War," Words can't describe my love for this film so, in one word, just like Spider-Man: Amazing!
","8 years ago, some of the greatest characters in comic history had a whole new world opened up to them thanks to 2008's Iron Man. Nobody thought the film would have the impact it did, including me. Now we are in 2016 and we have reached Captain America: Civil War. It boasts the most characters in a Marvel film, the best film in the entire Marvel franchise and also the greatest action scene in any superhero movie ever, but we will get onto that later.So the film serves as not only a new Avengers story but also a solid sequel to Captain America: The Winter Soldier. It would be easy to make a film with so many characters sideline the Captain America story, but this film really is at it's core a Captain America film. Sure there is a lot to cram in but it is done so well and fits in so well as part of a trilogy. I saw this film as a midnight screening and saw it along with the other two films beforehand. It really is a good idea to watch both Captain America films before and notice the detail put in to incorporate these stories. Cap is my all time favourite Avenger and seeing the development all three of these films has give him really is amazing.The basic plot without spoilers involves the Avengers causing a huge disaster on a mission in Lagos which results in the government devising the Sokovia accords which they must sign in order to operate under them. Tony Stark feels guilty about the casualties and destruction but Steve Rogers wants to keep operating freely and saving the world. This results in a divide between them and the other Avengers are forced to decide who's side they are on. Whilst this is happening Cap and Falcon are still on the hunt for Bucky Barnes which does play in to the start of the Civil War but i will leave it at that. So already there is a lot going on and we also get the introduction of Spider-Man and Black Panther as well as Daniel Brul as villain Baron Zemo. It would be easy to make this film a complete mess like Batman v Superman but it was not. It is hard not to compare the films because they are quite similar, involving destruction etc. But this film does it so much better.The airport scene in this film where the two teams fight for the first time is perfect. Tom Holland's introduction as Spider-Man happens just before this and his personality even when fighting is perfectly nailed. Black Panther also feels the same way, just the way these characters are on the big screen is a dream come true. Seeing Ant Man (who is awesome by the way) interact with Vision and Spiderman interact with Ant Man and Black Panther interact with Captain America etc. It is perfect. I also have seen the film and still don't know which side i am on. You want to be with both Steve and Tony on this because they are both right and have valid points. But seeing the personalities of every character clash and play in to every scene they are in is just brilliant. The villain of the film, Zemo, is average at best though which is the only small gripe. Crossbones as well barely has any screen time, but Zemo's plan almost seems like something that the teams could have fought over themselves.At 2 hours 20 mins there is a lot to cram in but in the end as a Marvel film this one is the best by far. It is emotional, hilarious and most importantly awesome. I cannot recommend the film enough. I have seen it twice already and that won't be the last time. Films don't get much better than this.",10,19,41,2 May 2016
Inside Out," a JOY to watch..
","Yeah i used an emotion pun, sue me.Inside Out is a film I've been hyped for, we got no Pixar film at all last year, but it has been worth the wait because Inside Out more than makes up for it. All i will talk about here is the basic premise. I went into this film knowing only that and it was for the best as it was a genuine surprise. Riley is an 11 year old girl growing up with her parents and moving house which is always a time of mixed emotions. Speaking of emotions, her mind is controlled by 5 of them Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust and Anger. The way these emotions control her mind is so clever and fun to see. The standout is Lewis Black as Anger. He was incredibly funny and a joy to watch (ironically). I also love Amy Poeller as Joy. The cast was perfectly chosen and she is pure proof of it. She is relatable and we feel for her as all she wants is the best for Riley, like another character in the film who i feel i can't talk about as this character in particular comes as a genuine surprise.Joy and Sadness go on a journey to preserve Riley's memories, leaving the other emotions in charge. I also loved this as it gave us some of the funnier moments of the film to see how her mind worked with limited emotion. The cleverness came from the simplest things such as how a certain advertisement can get stuck in your head for days or how you forget a certain memory, but again i feel i have to keep these aspects brief. Sure it will sound like a cheap pun to say it, but Inside Out is the most emotional Pixar film for ages. Everyone will at least relate to one character or situation. Admit it, we all have a friend like Bill Hader's Fear. It makes me wonder how our minds actually do work. Emotions just seemed to get way more interesting. Its like the questions Toy Story put in our heads, but as weird as it sounds they seem more real here.The way this film is given to us, it is more of an adult film. Pixar are great at giving us films that kids and adults will love, they have definitely done it again. It is so clever that all of the references to real life that we are given will fly straight over kids heads, but they will love the journey and adventure Joy and Sadness go on. I like that a lot. I can't think of a single flaw i have with this film. The perfect film is something that is almost impossible to come by, yet this is probably the closest we will get. I knew this film would be great, but Inside Out exceeded all my expectations. It is literally a film for anyone and everyone. Well done Pixar, once again you have outdone yourself. I cannot recommend this film enough and i give it my highest rating of 10/10.",10,6,32,4 August 2015
It Follows," Horror is going back to its roots!
","Until this week It Follows was a film I hadn't even heard of, then I saw the overwhelming attention it had received and I actually felt like this would be a horror film that my stick with me, turns out I was right, this is the best horror experience since The Babadook and it truly terrified me, in fact as I am writing this review I am getting shivers because it is a film that relies on psychological horror rather than jump scares (it had one or two but they were well executed at least), and the more I think about it, the more I like it.The film follows Jay, who is a girl who has everything going for her, until a sexual encounter changes everything. A curse was passed to her like a sexually transmitted disease and the only way she can get rid of this curse is by sleeping with somebody else. As the film progresses Jay is plagued by zombie-like imagery of people she knows and loves that only she is able to see and it makes for some skin-crawlingly scary scenes. The way the plot sounds doesn't make the film sound like it is anything special and i have to admit the plot synopsis on IMDb didn't make me want to rush out and see the film, but I am very glad I did.Horror films recently have been tripe, back in the 70s and 80s we had classic horror such as The Evil Dead and A Nightmare on Elm Street among others, these films were heavily reliant on psycholgical and creepy imagery that really did work. More recently we have had a slew of films that have just been jump scares thrown into a sequence of events and called a film.. Prime examples of recent films are Annabelle and The Woman In Black Angel of Death.. neither of these films worked as horror and I found myself more bored than creeped out. Then I saw an awesome film called The Babadook which really made me feel like good horror still exists, I don't want to compare this film to The Babadook too much but I found them to be similar in the way that they both scared the living daylights out of me and had me thinking about them long after seeing them. I cannot remember the last time I felt that way about horror, but with these examples I believe with some more work horror cinema will get back to the way it once was.In the end It Follows is a well acted (especially the main actress who was believable and a pleasure to watch) and downright creepy film that I would definitely recommend to anybody who is a horror fan. The cinematography really shone and the soundtrack was terrifyingly awesome, the score is still in my head and i guarantee after seeing this you will walk out of the cinema and will be really conscious of the people around you. Never will I look at an old lady behind me again without thinking she is going to follow and murder me for her own amusement. It also has what most horrors don't nowadays which is an INCREDIBLY intense climax. I was on the edge of my seat gripping my girlfriend's hand tight in suspense until the very end. One of the gripes I do have is that the ending did kind of suck and was so abrupt that I don't know exactly how I feel about it, although I can see why it was done in this way. Now if you will excuse me there is a creepy lady walking towards me and I have to run, looks like this will be a sleepless night.",8,33,67,27 February 2015
Legend," Blood is thicker than water.
","The Kray twins have a fascinating story which has been told many times, but I always like to see true life stories about people like this because it is almost guaranteed to keep me interested. When I saw that Tom Hardy would be betraying both Ronnie and Reggie i was completely sold on the film and couldn't wait to see it.From the trailer what we are shown is a story that focuses on these two as individuals tearing up the streets of London, but we do get something quite different from that. Less focus was put into the empire of the notorious gangsters and what we get is more of a story that revolves around the marriage and relationship of Reggie Kray and his wife Frances. This was actually a very pleasant surprise and I loved seeing how she was coping with the empire, plus the almost love triangle between herself, Ronnie and Reggie. Having an 18 rating I expected the film to be incredibly violent and have a no- holds barred feel to it. It seems a bit weird that a film that it almost tame with its violence gets the same rating as something like A Clockwork Orange. This isn't a complaint, but it was what i expected is the point i am making. The gorgeous Emily Browning does a great job at portraying the tragic Frances and really puts us in the character's shoes to get a feel of what life would be like if your husband were a (in)famous gangster. So, in my opinion a very good move on the film-makers.The thing that arguably mattered most though was Hardy's portrayal of both twins. With a film like the Social Network where Armie Hammer portrays twins, we can see he has done a good job but it is hard to tell between the two. What Tom Hardy does best here is he gives each character a very different personality and we almost forget that we are only watching one actor. I was worried Ronnie's portrayal in particular would annoy me because Hardy puts on a thick accent and looked as if he would play it too over the top. He doesn't and actually managed to make the character very threatening as well as hilarious. I couldn't imagine another actor being able to pull off what he did here and if I had my way Hardy would be nominated for an Oscar just for going from the smooth almost likable Reggie to nutcase Ronnie in seconds. Also, there is an incredible fight scene in a pub where the twins are battering each other.. it is literally Tom Hardy fighting himself. Think Fight Club, but actually real.All in all, Legend was a very good film and a great look into the lives of these characters. Tom Hardy gives us one of 2015's best performances and whilst we don't see much really of the empire these men built, what we did get to see was something refreshing and new. Was glad to see Taron Egerton get a role in this film too, the guy needs to be in more after his performance in Kingsman. Legend had a very Clockwork Orange type suspension vibe to it and i dug that. I recommend this film purely to see Tom Hardy absolutely kill it in the dual role and there is a lot more to like about the film where that came from.",8,4,7,12 September 2015
Room," Heartwrenching yet surprisingly uplifting..
","Room was a film that i was very intrigued to see to the extent i actually did go out of my way to see it. I knew barely anything about it, i had seen the trailer a good few times in front of other movies but i never looked into it a great deal. It is one of those rare films that never strikes as something that would be worth going out of the way for, until it is actually released and then you think about it and realise you in fact do want to see it because it peaked my interest a great deal. With that being said, i do not regret my decision. It is a film i highly recommend in fact.First of all, Brie Larson stars as the main character, a young woman who was abducted from a young age and is forced to raise her son who is now five years old in a confined space that they deem 'room'. She gives us an incredible performance, i had only really seen her as Jonah Hill's love interest in 21 Jump Street, but she is so different here that it is hard to recognise her without prior knowledge of who she is. The stand out however is young Jacob Tremblay who plays the young boy Jack. I will say this now, he is really going places and will be a big star in the future if he carries on with performances like this. As a child actor his performance sucked me in as much as the big nominations currently in the Oscars. Whilst being vague, when you actually get to see him experience the outside world for the first time it really brought tears to my eyes because he plays the role in such a way that you really believe he has only known that one plave his whole life. For example he sees 'Old Nick' (the man who is keeping them captive) as a sort of magical being who brings them clothes etc. Because he has never even seen another person in his life. This makes it all the more interesting when he experiences real life people for the first time.At it's core the film is really a powerful story about the bond between a mother and son, but as well as this it is a metaphor for life itself and how we can take it for granted. With such amazing performances from the two leads it became something really special and whilst it is shocking and heartwrenching in places by the end it becomes a real uplifting, inspiring gem. As much as it may be tempting to ignore this film in favour of all the terrible comedies January is notable for, please don't. This is a film that must be seen. When i first saw it i thought maybe it dragged on 5 minutes too long, but in fact looking back i wouldn't take anything out. It shows us that nothing is more powerful than love and for that alone it deserves to be seen.",9,0,5,23 January 2016
Big Hero 6," Disney is making Marvel movies now.. ? its great to be alive
","Big Hero 6 is another movie based on Marvel source material but isn't like others recently released.. this one is also a Disney animated feature. How to train your dragon 2 was previously my favourite animated film of the year.. that was until i saw this gem.The story follows a smart kid named Hiro who is suffering from kid depression after his brother is killed in a huge fire. This is where he meets Baymax, the star of the film and possibly my favourite Disney character since Olaf the snowman. Baymax is a big lovable idiot-type robot who was built to provide healthcare for humans. Hiro sees Baymax as a chance to get revenge on his brother's killer and with him and his new- found friends they embark on a journey to get justice.Some of the film's best scenes come from Hiro's attempts to turn Baymax into a badass fighting machine. This results in hilarious moments because we still have our big lovable idiot.. but now he has awesome superpowers, and i must say this kept me thoroughly entertained. The other characters were also awesome and each had their own personality traits but at the end we are left with the relationship between Hiro and Baymax, although definitely not a bad thing because as an audience we can never have enough Baymax.I did feel that this film suffered from what Guardians of the Galaxy also suffered with which is that the villain was underdeveloped, although unlike Ronan the villain in this film (no spoilers) did have a fleshed out plan and was quite a surprise twist. In the end I came out of Big Hero 6 feeling satisfied and entertained, featuring the humour of Marvel and the heart of Disney, this one is well worth a watch for people of all ages and if you don't want your own personal Baymax by the end then something must be wrong with you!",9,78,123,2 February 2015
Jurassic World," Welcome to Jurassic Franchise..
","My thoughts on Jurassic World have been so mixed for a while. Jurassic Park is a classic with sequels that really do not hold up, the trailers for this one were released and they didn't really set my mind at ease, so for a while i just sort of thought 'at least Chris Pratt is in it'. I hoped it would go down the Mad Max: Fury Road road ( that sounded weird) and for the most part it did. The film does a good job at setting you up for a nice nostalgia trip and when it started i felt like all my worries would be invalid.The plot is hard to explain and keep spoiler free but don't worry i wont give anything away. 22 years after Jurassic Park, a new theme park Jurassic World has opened. A new breed of dinosaur has been created from splicing two existing breeds together and manages to escape from its facility, Owen Brady (Chris Pratt) and the somewhat uptight Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) take it upon themselves to stop the terror from destroying Isla Nublar and everyone in it. The way i have described it makes the film seem very basic and to be honest, yeah it is pretty basic, but there are things in the film which need to be seen as a fan of the original. What i like about Jurassic World is that you can see the film without any knowledge of the others, yet seeing the original film is definitely a bonus. There are a ton of throwbacks to the events of Jurassic Park, some are hilarious and others feel a little shoehorned in and don't always work, but just know that they are very much there. From the moment that the doors open and we pan around Jurassic World with the iconic theme blasting out around us.. that is when we know that this film is more of a passion project than anything and it does a good job at being nostalgic. In this sense i will say Jurassic World is definitely the best sequel of the franchise.Chris Pratt as always is an absolute delight to watch. He takes this role like all of his others and makes it his very own. His character was very much an Indiana Jones type which makes the rumours of him playing Indy all the more exiting. I also never realised how hot Bryce Dallas Howard is until i saw this, as well as this she too does a great job and is a badass towards the end which made her so much more than the critics calling her a cliché uptight business type woman. After Daredevil it is awesome to see Vincent D'onofrio in anything but in this he felt kind of out of place and his character felt a bit wasted in my opinion, and ramping up the nostalgia again BD Wong returns as the only original Jurassic Park cast member and i found myself welcoming him back with open arms.The most important thing is arguably the dinosaurs here. When i saw the trailer they looked like they were a CGI mess and found that the animatronics from the original held up much better. I still feel the original dinosaurs did look better but the velociraptors really do look and feel like a real part of the cast and the new dinosaur introduce (Indominous Rex) was honestly a thing of nightmares. It was scary as hell and looked so cool, the design of it alone was nothing short of spectacular and every scene featuring it (there are a lot) was intense and had me on the edge of my seat because like the original, you never know who will survive this beast and posed more of a threat than most monsters in movies today.I will wrap this review up by saying that if you go into this film expecting a fun monster movie with some cheesy one liners and some brilliant action sequences then this film will please you. If you're a Jurassic park fan this will please you also. No it is definitely not as good and does have its fair share of flaws, but the climax sets the series in a new direction and it was a welcome one. Now having the biggest opening weekend of all time and a set up like that scream sequel. You know what? Im okay with that and with the return of the current box office king Chris Pratt i can see a whole new trilogy on the horizon. Mad max did it, Jurassic World did it.. don't let us down Terminator Genysis. You may have a ridiculous title but give us the nostalgia we crave!",8,7,18,20 June 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," there are no strings to hold this movie down.
","Once in a while a film comes around which raises your expectations so high and excites so much that it seems they cannot be exceeded so simply. Yet we are talking about a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie here, full of the fun, humour and characters that have never failed to disappoint before. I can safely say that my reasoning for Avengers Age of Ultron being my most anticipated film for 3 years is totally justified and it did not disappoint in any way. The emotions it left me feeling were some of the best i have felt for a long time and throughout i was smiling and felt like i was a member of the team Marvel have spent so long building up, and they are very much a team here taking us on a journey much bigger than the first and in many ways better.The film opens with an incredible action sequence and stays that way until the very end of the post-credits scene which has become a staple at the very core of Marvel. Here Tony Stark has been working on a dormant peace keeping programme that is set to save the world so that the Avengers aren't needed anymore and can take a well deserved break. Enter Ultron, played as perfectly as a fan could wish for with the chilling voice of James Spader who gives real depth to a character who had to be done right to be brought to the screen. The Avengers assemble once again to counter Ultron who sees them as the only threat to the world he is sworn to protect and on the way encounter twins Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver who are insanely awesome characters. A lot of fans worried that Aaron-Taylor Johnson would be a disappointment compared to the perfect portrayal in last years Xmen film but i can say safely that they are two very different takes on Quicksilver and that they both did absolutely brilliant jobs. Elisabeth Olsen as Scarlett Witch again also provides us with a huge deal of depth and really makes the character her own. I must say though whilst everybody in the film, and i mean everybody, did a phenomenal job the standout is definitely Paul Bettany as the Vision. Without spoilers i can say without a doubt that he is the best character for me and is brought to the screen as perfectly as anyone could have imagined to counter the bad-ass Ultron. Joss Whedon gives it his all and that is definitely no understatement.Each Avenger has their own demons to battle and we get to know them so much better than we already did. In particular what i loved was firstly the relationship between not only Bruce Banner and Black Widow but also the relationship she had with the Hulk. They played off each other so well. Black Widow really got to shine here. We knew the back stories of the Avengers because we got to see them in standalone films but hers is finally told to us and Scarlett Johansson brings a real feel of emotion to her character that we haven't previously gotten to know. We also get Thor who has demons to battle and we see more of an insight as to what is going on in his head and Captain America who is coming to grips with the life he has been given in modern times which was explored subtlety but very well. Also i know you are all wondering, yes the Iron man Hulkbuster vs Hulk fight was incredible and nothing short of spectacular. I loved Hulk in this film as he was more than the muscle of the team and the fight with Stark was given context instead of being thrown in for the fun of it (but that doesn't mean it isn't fun). Plus i was very happy to see Hawkeye was given a huge deal of screen time, he was bad-ass and shone a new light on him as a character which was awesome.A couple minor flaws, but they are minor are that Ultron did have less screen time than i hoped. He was awesome but you almost want to see more by the conclusion. Also the post-credits scene was pretty cool but so short and i just wish i could have seen a little more in terms of set-up. Other than that you will not find a better time at the cinema and i doubt that will change for the rest of the year.Avengers Age of Ultron is without a doubt my number one MCU film and featured all the action, humour and characters that we are promised and more. War Machine even shows up for the fun as well as Falcon even if only for a small time. Plus Nick Fury was as great as ever. All balanced with a slight dose of dark elements and we are given the perfect summer movie to enjoy again and again. Will be seeing it again on Sunday for sure. I am in love with everything about this film at the minute including the incredible soundtrack. 'Didn't see that coming?' Neither did i. 'There are no strings on me'.",10,23,50,24 April 2015
The Witch," the most unnerving cinematic experience in a very long time.
","I've heard a lot about this film prior to going in. It is the sort of film that you either really like or really dislike and it is clear why. The Witch is a 1630s English folktale and it doesn't shy away from showing that. Things get very real very fast and i can easily say this is the most unnerving films i have been to see for quite some time.By that i don't mean it is a jump scare fest. I've seen a fair share of horror movies this year and all of them have been complete tripe, with countless jumpscares and a put you to sleep kind of vibe. The Witch features my favourite type of horror, the psychological type, and with that it provided something truly unique. The plot is simple, a 1630s family is torn apart and plagued by witchcraft and terrible unsettling things happen. Of course a lot more does happen, and over the course of the film i felt more and more uneasy. I have heard people complain the 1630s feel makes it boring, but never once was i bored. I was transported straight to this time period and i was transfixed to the screen for the entire duration. This is very much a family film and every member of the family does such an amazing job. The father of the family plays his role so well and you are constantly guessing what he is possibly hiding. This film will keep you guessing the whole way through, but does a stellar job at getting right inside your head and under your skin.The first scene where the witch was introduced to the audience happens quite early on, it genuinely terrified me. Not to the point i was screaming aloud and jumping out of my seat, it was a different type of terrified. I was glued to my seat, not able to take my eyes off the screen as the sounds from the speakers were ringing through my ears getting louder and louder until the scene changed and put me back into reality. All of the scenes like this were the same, they would consume and take you out of reality for a bit to remind you that what you are watching is something that could have easily happened. It was terrifying also how realistic this film actually was, i know it was only filmed over a course of 25 days but it feels like the camera crew literally went out to film a 1630s family suffering from the threat of witchcraft and put it into a 90 minute film. I love when a 90 minute film can pull you in so much that it feels like a lot longer. I hope psychological horror makes a huge comeback, i said this when i reviewed It Follows and until now, nothing had quite compared, but The Witch does. It is the best horror for a very long time and is one that i will honestly be thinking about for well over a week because that is what this genre of film does for me. Go and see it in cinemas.. but if you are faint hearted then beware because it will keep you up at night, in the best possible way.",8,4,10,12 March 2016
Pitch Perfect 2," Aca-fun time!
","Yes i used the cliché of giving this film an aca-pun in my summary.. But who can resist it? When i first saw Pitch Perfect i didn't think it was great and i didn't laugh all that much, saw it again and enjoyed it a lot more! I was actually kind of looking forward to this film and no it is not as good as the first, but i still had a lot of fun with it. The Barden Bellas all return in this sequel to the surprise hit and for the most part don't disappoint.Pitch Perfect 2 starts out fairly similar to the first film, the Barden Bellas however are now better than ever and at the top of their game. After a humiliating wardrobe mishap from Fat Amy in front of the president of the United States though (Barack and Michelle Obama appear in what is probably reused footage) the Bellas must refind their sound and compete in the aca-pella world finals to keep the Barden Bellas together. I had a few more problems with this film than i did with the first film, thats not to say it is a bad film, but sometimes it is a bit clear that Elizabeth Banks didn't really know what direction she wanted to take it in. We have the initial plot, yet it doesn't really kick in until probably an hour into the film as a lot of it is either focused on Beca (Anna Kendrick) working for a job internship, which was funny and all and had good moments to it including a great cameo from Snoop Dogg, but it never really played into the film all that much. Then we had the bizarre romance story between Rebel Wilson's Fat Amy and Bumper, which is fine but sometimes took us away from the plot.That being said, what we are really here for is the aca-pella and it was absolutely awesome! Skylar Astin returns and his groups aca-pella performance at the beginning was great but he sort of disappears halfway through and i wanted to see more of him singing. One scene in particular though i really did enjoy. We got a 5-way aca-pella battle including the Barden Bellas and it really was great to hear these different sounds combined. I really enjoyed the aca-pella from Das Sound Machine, and was even more surprised to see that the hilarious Flula, known for his bizarre song covers on youtube, was in the group. The last songs at the aca-pella finals from both Das Sound Machine and the Barden Bellas were also very good and had me smiling throughout.So whilst the humour doesn't always fit, like some jokes do fall flat and the Asian girl was just weird in an uncomfortable way. And whilst i feel the film went on a little too long, the bootcamp scenes should have come a lot sooner and the whole story with the new member of the Bellas was completely unneeded. I still feel that when the humour hits it really hits (feel kind of bad for finding the commentators racist humour so funny). The performances were once again great and the songs were incredible. I would say fans of the original will love this and even if you didn't love the first and merely liked it you will still have fun with this film. I'll be singing these songs for days and suspect if you see it then you will too!",7,5,14,20 May 2015
"Hail, Caesar!"," another solid Coens brothers effort.. just not quite a classic yet
","I love the Coen brothers. They are responsible for some of my favourite comedy films including The Big Lebowski and Fargo so naturally i had high hopes for Hail, Caeser! Amazing star studded cast, interesting premise and a brilliant trailer. The film isn't quite to scale of those classics but it is a very solid film and i did have a lot of fun watching it.Hail, Caeser! Is the name of a film within a film that provides the backbone of the movie. Josh Brolin is a top Hollywood screenwriter, Ed Mannix and George Clooney plays his leading man Baird Whitlock. When Baird is kidnapped from the set Ed wonders to himself why?! And that is about all i can say because the trailers are vague and i want everyone to go into this film not knowing too much because i guarantee you will have a better time. Now i did mention the cast is star-studded but by that i mean they all have very small roles. Clooney and Brolin are the only characters who get a huge amount of screen time and the story very much revolves around them, which is fine because they both shine. Especially Clooney walkibg around in an amusing roman get up. Scarlett Johansson shows up and does well as always but for a very limited and almost pointless time. Jonah Hill, he is just a cameo. I was excited to see how Jonah Hill would fare in a Coens brothers film but he appears for probably 30 seconds or less. Channing Tatum is great too though, he adds comedic flair but also has a big role to play in the main storyline.Can i recommend Hail Caeser to a variety of audiences? Yes i can. Fans of the Coens will have a good time, media students like myself and screenwriters will have a good time and i believe general moviegoers will enjoy themselves too. There are a good few laugh out loud moments and it is a lot of fun unravelling the bigger picture. Like i said, not quite a classic yet, but maybe it can reach cult status in years to come.",8,0,2,9 March 2016
The Big Short," Interesting look at how the rich get richer..
","Adam McKay making a black comedy about the Wall Street crash? Im already sold. Throw in Christian Bale, Steve Carrell, Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt.. how could you go wrong? The film was a very interesting look into the corruption of the government and how the rich take from the poor in order to get richer, it is something we have seen before but with it's own style and the subject matter interests me greatly, so naturally i found a lot to like and enjoy about this film.First off, i swear marketing wanted us to believe this was going to be the Christian Bale show.. i mean don't get me wrong he did a good job in this film and as always is a joy to watch, but the film wasn't focused around him as i expected. We follow each of these characters in different ways. Ryan Gosling adds the energy in the vein of a Jordan Belfort type character (i will touch on that later), Steve Carrell doesn't provide as much of the comic relief as i thought, he adds more of an emotional core to the story which i was surprised to see from a character played by an actor of his calibur. Don't get me wrong the dude is funny, but he is someone who has suffered a great loss and who is an angry guy but you can see why. In my opinion he gets my pick for best performance in this film. Brad Pitt's character was necessary but with him he just sort of felt like halfway through the movie he randomly joined in, disappeared for a bit and then came back for the finale. But i like seeing him in these Brad Pitt type roles where he is so cool and suave about everything and always so damn likable!Now, the film does feel like at times it copies a fair bit from The Wolf of Wall Street. The fast-paced opening where Ryan Gosling introduces what is going on to the audience is exactly like how it happened with that film which is the main comparison to Jordan Belfort. That being said McKay employs his own style and we see the fast paced editing take effect where we see certain images pop up and clips etc. But some of it is very random and feels kind of out of place. For example, random celebrities are brought in at random times to explain certain plot points and whilst humorous, it probably would have just made more sense to have one of the existing characters explain it to us. But then again, it would just draw more WoWS comparisons i guess. But the insight into this corrupt world was as interesting as ever and it is sort of set out as a heist movie of sorts with a knockout soundtrack. It establishes the subject matter in it's own right and i liked that, so i will give it props.In the end, the film entertains a lot more than something like Ride Along 2 and is worth checking out on a Sunday afternoon when you want to relax and chill out. I will say see it for sure. The acting is great, it's captivating and it is a film that keeps your mind working afterwards and that is exactly what i wanted from it, so it didn't disappoint.",8,0,0,26 January 2016
Straight Outta Compton," Boyz n Da Hood meets 8 Mile.. A Modern Classic.
","Straight Outta Compton is the story of N.W.A, a group of 5 men growing up in Compton and the struggle they face with the police as well as their rise to fame and how they influenced the world. As controversial as the group is, they have inspired many including myself, this film is a perfect reflection of that. From the beginning we get a glimpse into how the police treated these people because of their skin colour. This was a very real thing and the film does a perfect job at showing this, to an almost shocking degree. First off,the cast is perfect. O'Shea Jackson shines in particular. He plays Ice Cube and is actually his son in real life. It can't be easy playing your father, but he makes it seem that way. His mannerisms and look are just brilliant, it is almost as if we are seeing Ice Cube himself. Dr. Dre and Eazy-E are also played brilliantly and i could not see anyone doing a better job. This film is very much based around those three members of NWA, whilst DJ Yella and MC Ren do have parts to play it was a bit odd that they didn't get nearly enough screen time as Cube, Dre and E. Paul Giamatti also appears as manager of NWA Jerry Heller. I'm not entirely sure how accurate his role was in the movie but Paul Giamatti does great at being part caring manager, part corporate douchebag.Around the third act the film slows down in pace as it shows us the fall of NWA and the feud with Ice Cube. Where many people saw this as a flaw, i was as entertained with this portion of the film as i was with the rest of it. We start to see how the members of the group are dealing with their own personal issues, so as a result we get a good look behind the scenes of the glamour and music as well as the personal lives of people we thought we knew. For example, we get to see Ice Cube writing the script for Friday which shows how he is moving on from NWA. A character in the film talks about how NWA is glamorising drugs and violence, as producers Ice Cube and Dr. Dre do brilliantly at showing us how this wasn't the case. You can really see in the writing that they are passionate about this story.Overall, Straight Outta Compton is one of the gems of the year. The soundtrack is brilliant and had me rapping along to the lyrics on more than one occasion. It made me laugh, it made me tear up at points and in a way it really inspired me to be what i want to be. I highly recommend this film to absolutely anyone who will listen. It demands to be seen in cinemas and is one i will most definitely be buying on blu-ray. One of 2015's best movies and that is no exaggeration. Time to go home and blast out the old NWA records.9.5/10",9,9,45,28 August 2015
Iron Man," The correct way to build a universe
","Anyone remember the days when Marvel studios wasn't a mammoth technical market and didn't feature Norse gods and talking raccoons? I figured that because i am finally going to see my most anticipated film 'Avengers Age of Ultron' tonight i would revisit the very start of the Marvel cinematic Universe and get to know Tony Stark all over again. This film really stood out to me back in 2008 as one of the best films i'd seen, not just in the superhero genre but in general. To this day the film still stands out to me as the best standalone film and the perfect way to start the universe we have all grown to love. Iron Man was very much more grounded in reality, i mean sure none of the things that Stark creates and uses can be replicated, but at the time going from this to Thor seemed like it wasn't possible. Oh, how times change.The plot follows Tony Stark, who as you all know by now is played with absolute perfection and flawlessness (is that a word) by the very talented Robert Downey Jr. He is given an electromagnet to prevent shrapnel from entering his heart and killing him from what was an explosion by his own company's weapon. Instead of building a missile that terrorists demand from him Tony builds an arc reactor and a suit of armour that he uses to get his own back. This causes Stark to order all weapons stop being made and he develops a high-tech suit to use and becomes the hero we all love, Iron Man. Jeff Bridges is also very good and uses an accent that isn't Texan cowboy with throat cancer as Obadiah Stane (Iron Monger) who has his own plans for Stark Industries and the final showdown between Iron Man and Iron Monger gives us what is one of the most spectacular from phase one. Marvel has never had a strong point for villains, Ronan from Guardians of the Galaxy is a prime example. But when they get a villain right they get it very right! (Think Loki) and Obadiah Stane in this movie is one of the best the MCU has to offer.Watching Gwyneth Paltrow in this movie felt weird too. She was very much just Tony's assistant and acted a lot differently to the way she does in say, Iron Man 3. This is some really good development for her character and she of course does a great job as Pepper Potts. We also have Terrence Howard as James Rhodes which looking at it now felt out of place since we have all gotten used to Don Cheadele. This isn't to say he did a bad job, in fact he did a very good job but it would be nice to know why he didn't appear in any subsequent films after this. A particular scene featured Rhodes looking at Tony's Mark II suit (War Machine prototype) and saying 'next time, baby'. Sorry Terrence, not next time.In the end Iron Man is absolutely the best way to kick off a universe of characters and he will always be the Avenger that sticks with me as a result of this movie. Downey Jr. Made the character his very own and i cannot imagine another actor taking his place. Robert is Iron Man and is the best casting since Hugh Jackman as WolverineI give Iron Man a perfect rating as it is a film that i have grown to love more since i first saw it and it will be a part of my collection until the very end. Definitely check it out if you haven't already. Plus we got our first scenes with Coulson and our first post-credits scene which is still the best one today. All this and more, it not only stands as one of my favourite superhero movies but one of the best of all time. I will be reviewing Tony Stark's latest adventure with Avengers Age of Ultron tonight so stay tuned for that! And yes.. i am so excited that if i wait any longer i will self destruct.",10,2,3,24 April 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," The greatest Gladiator match in the history of the world.. sort of
","So first things first i am not a fan of Man of Steel, i really didn't like it. But also bear in mind that i was excited as hell when this film got announced. So Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice, how could you not be excited by that name? But like many i have some strong feelings on the film that need to be addressed and i will dive straight into them. The film follows on directly from Man of Steel and the opening is very cool. We are shown the destruction of Metropolis and it was quite an interesting take on what most people hated from MoS. We are introduced to Bruce Wayne who was there when things were going down with Superman and Zod and straight off the bat (no pun intended) Ben Affleck was incredible. He gives what is in my opinion the most accurate and raw performance as Bruce Wayne and Batman yet, as one of the few people that was on board with Batfleck from the beginning that makes me happy. Jeremy Irons as Alfred i also liked a lot, but he wasn't in it enough and instead the focus is on less interesting characters such as Amy Adams' Lois Lane, who did nothing in this film and bored me.So overall the Batman element was very cool and it was great getting to see him do some real detective work. Ben Affleck's take from that to the fighting style was very similar to the Arkham games but take that as a huge positive. Anyway, that being said the rest of the film just comes across in one word as Sloppily edited. Scenes will be taking place and then completely change into another scene that feels out of place and has no context. This happens a hell of a lot of times. I have no problem with Henry Cavill but in this film Superman is one of the least interesting parts. At first it is interesting to see him in the courthouse and he is on trial, people are trying to figure out whether he is a hero or a threat. I liked that, but i feel it is something that maybe should have been addressed in Man of Steel and not here because honestly it takes up most of the film and just comes across as boring after a while, especially when the film focuses on Clark and Lois for long periods of time.So already it feels like a lot is going on, but there is more. My biggest worry was Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, i felt he was a miscast and guess what, i've seen the film and i still feel like he is a miscast. Lex only speaks in one liners for this entire film and it did not feel like the character although he was playing Lex Luthor Jr. It was nice to see Jesse put his own stamp in the character but ultimately it didn't work because as i was watching the film i was thinking 'this guy would be great as The Riddler'. So we have the subplot of Lex obtaining Kryptonite in order to take out Superman as well as creating Doomsday for no reason. Then we have Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman. I'll be honest, i thought she was awesome but the film would have been the same film without her. I feel she was used to shoehorn in other members of the Justice League who are all introduced, my favourite of which was Cyborg, but we do see Aquaman and the Flash too. Anyway, when Wonder Woman turns up it was an awesome moment, she had her own really cool theme song and the Trinity standing together was such a wow moment and it made me crack a huge smile. But yeah, she has her own plot so already we are getting ahead of ourselves and haven't even spoken about the main event. So the fight happens towards the end of the movie and is resolved in about 10 minutes. The fight itself was really cool, Batman and Superman clashing was awesome and the dialogue between them was great, i like how they made Superman more human because you actually see him get hurt. The fight is so brutal but the way the two of them resolve it, well it was just ridiculous. And then we have Doomsday, who for one thing was spoiled in the trailer, but he didn't need to be here at all. He was like the love child of a 2012 Ninja Turtle and the troll from Harry Potter, but he was literally just a plot point to bring the Trinity together and to see them fight on the big screen for the first time which admittedly was cool to see.In the end, i can't help but feel disappointed by Dawn of Justice. Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot are going to make great additions to the DCU and there are a lot of cool things to like. But the pacing is terrible, the CGI completely took me out of it especially during the weird dream sequence. The villain had no motivation and i forgot why he was after Superman and most of the characters, besides Batman and Wonder Woman, were uninteresting. Is it worth seeing? Well, sure but i know you will be seeing it anyway. Is the pay off enough? No it really isn't. It was cool to see the characters together but the film could have been so much more. I am however excited for the Wonder Woman movie and excited to see how they move things forward in later films so if the film was trying to be a tease for things to come in the future then yes it did succeed, even if in the end all we get is something that is 100% average.",5,1,5,26 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," it's true, all of it... i've fallen in love all over again
","30 years ago the incredible Star Wars trilogy came to an end, many didn't expect the return of the characters we grew to love and cherish, but now they have returned and JJ Abrams has given us back a world which shaped so many childhoods and i could not be happier. This review will be completely spoiler-free, which will be hard with so much to cover, but i will not be revealing anything here which you didn't already know from trailers.A very basic story outline is that we follow Rey and Finn, two characters who are quite similar in many ways, but who are so interesting to get to know. I won't be revealing anything else because if i do i will literally be treading into spoiler territory. First things first though, Harrison Ford as Han Solo. My god. Han Solo is my favourite character in the entire Star Wars saga. Harrison Ford does such a good job at bringing this character back that he alone shows us why we missed this universe so much. He wasn't shoehorned in either. He played a vital part in the plot and did the best job possible. I loved seeing him and Chewbacca, who was hilarious in this film, step onto the Millennium Falcon for the first time. When the opening title crawl came onto the screen with the iconic John Williams theme playing through the IMAX speaker system my heart swelled with nostalgia and my eyes filled with tears. This was a moment i never expected to see and it could not have been done in a better way. The same goes for Han and Chewie stepping onto the falcon. It was just that good.That being said, the main cast of newcomers were incredible. John Boyega's Finn is such a relatable character who has done wrong and just wants to right that and Oscar Issac as Poe was just the most likable guy ever. But my favourite character in the entire film was Rey. I love Daisy Ridley, she is such a likable person and I had every faith that she would make this role her own and completely shine in this film.. which she did. Getting to know Rey as a character turned out to be the most interesting part of this film for me, which is saying a lot because A LOT happens. As well as this we have our new 'Empire' who are known as the First Order. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren was also such a joy to watch. He didn't just play this bad character who was bad for the sake of it. He had real human emotion. He played the character as someone who was fearful and had a sort of emotional vibe which set him apart from other villains in the saga. I was however disappointed by the lack of anything Captain Phasma does in this film.. she is literally the new Boba Fett. Im not saying that is a bad thing, i was just expecting her to do more.I saw this film in IMAX. The locations and set design are stunning. There is a scene where Rey is introduced on Jakku and we see the area, it is so well shot that i felt there and was literally amazed by what i was seeing. I also like the high use of Practical effects. Almost every character we see is practical, whereas others who are CGI such as Maz Kanata (motion capture) look so real that they don't feel out of place. But a lot of praise for going back to the original route of using mostly practical effects. A lot of people say this is too similar to the original Star Wars film, whilst the last act is pretty similar, this film did feel like its own film at the same time. Some characters such as C3PO and R2D2 feel kind of like if they weren't there it wouldn't make a difference, but like i said new characters really feel at home here. BB8 had a lot of great moments which were real highlights of the film, he also played a huge part in the plot of this film which surprised me.But all-in-all what can i say except, thank you JJ Abrams. This film makes us realise why we missed this universe so damn much. From seeing the Falcon take flight for the first time, to seeing Han and Leia reunite for the first time, it warmed my heart as a huge Star Wars fan and i smiled almost the whole time in this film. There are a few real emotionally heart wrenching scenes too though. I laughed, i cried and having the franchise in the hands of newcomers Daisy Ridley and John Boyega as well as Oscar Isaac, well i am just okay with that. They have bright careers ahead of them and they have really proved themselves. This is the best in the saga since The Empire Strikes Back and i cant wait to see where this story is heading, as well as seeing this film again. May the force be with you",10,15,49,19 December 2015
What We Do in the Shadows," Fangtastically Hysterical!
","What we do in the Shadows is a film i heard about a while ago, I saw the trailer and knew it had a great deal of potential but was a film that I knew had to be seen to decide whether I could truly see it as a great comedy. Going into the film it is best to know as little as possible because it is such a surprise and such a pleasure to watch that nothing can be spoiled.The plot follows a group of vampires who share a flat and have a documentary crew follow them around as they try to adjust to everyday life despite being undead creatures of the night. The premise is one that we have seen, the oddball or group of oddballs are taken from one scenario to the other and have to adjust to a different lifestyle, but to tackle this in a mockumentary format with mythical creatures we have all heard of before is something completely new and it works better than most recent comedies have. There are some truly side-splitting scenes that had me laughing out loud. There is something genuinely hysterical about seeing these vampires do household chores and attempt to get into nightclubs which really makes me want to see more comedy like this. I found the circle of shame particarly funny.There are also a fair few twists and turns along the way, we get zombies and werewolves.. and these twists turn this from an ordinary mockumentary into something very special indeed. There are scenes where the comedy may run dry or it will go on for a little too long, but in the end this film pays off and it is nothing short of fun and is incredibly enjoyable. Some people may not 'get' the style of comedy used which is fine, but for me it was original and the funniest film for a while. Definitely worth a watch, especially if you're wondering what vampires get up to when you're sleeping.",8,0,2,28 February 2015
Deadpool," as far as comic book movies go.. perfection!
","Back in 2008 (or 2009, who cares?) We got our first glimpse of Deadpool on the big screen. What we got took away everything decent about the character, he is the merc with the mouth, yet his mouth was sewn together! Ryan Reynolds seemed perfect for the role, how did it all go so wrong? Well now, in 2016 Reynolds returns and we get our first official Deadpool movie. In that we get the world's greatest apology for one of the most abysmal films in the superhero genre, and a highly original film that does 100% justice to one of the most lovable douchebags of all time!So, here we follow Wade Wilson, a former mercenary who is diagnosed with terminal cancer. He undergoes an experimental procedure and is transformed into Deadpool, a badass loudmouth with the ability to heal. One problem remains, he is now ugly as sin. We follow Deadpool on a revenge story, as well as a love story of sorts that really raises the bar for future comic book movies. What i absolutely love about this film is that the whole origin is told through flashbacks looking over Wade's life. Deadpool is a character who is well known for breaking the fourth wall and the way that is addressed in this film is both hilarious and amazingly true to it's source. It is also easily one of the funniest films for a very long time. The opening titles had me laughing out loud alone and if they don't peak your interest right away then I'm afraid you're in the wrong film! I love self aware jokes like that and there are a fair few of them scattered around. The supporting cast do amazingly well as well. Colossus and Negasonic TeenageWarhead from the Xmen are just the greatest additions to this film. This is easily the best incarnation of Colossus we have ever seen and with such a low budget he looked beautiful. Of course, with them on board there are some very funny Xmen jokes to look out for. Morenna Baccarin (did i spell that right?) Is the perfect love interest for Ryan Reynolds. Her character is a lot better than other 2-Dimensional females in comic book films. When she is introduced and the way that happens shows how much of an impact she makes and it is great. As for villains, Ed Skerin was so unlikeable, which is great because with a character like Deadpool it is important to hate our main villain and the inclusion of Angel Dust was also a good decision. And lastly, TJ Miller acts almost as Wade's second in command, Weasel. He stole quite a few scenes, but in the end this is Ryan Reynold's show and nobody tries to take that from him.So do i recommend? Hell yeah i do! Its the perfect comic book film for the fact it really sticks to it's awesome source material and i could not imagine a better film for Deadpool. Stick around for after the credits because we get a great little surprise. Definitely not for the faint of heart because as well as being very violent in an over the top way, there are also some pretty dark and shocking scenes that can even be a little hard to watch, but they don't last long. Anyway, go and support Deadpool because we need more superhero films like this. Now i have the sudden urge to listen to 80's music and eat chimi changas...",10,33,68,12 February 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," ladies and gentlemen.. i have a new favourite film
","I expected this film to be good.. in fact i expected this film to be great.. but nothing could have prepared me for the experience that is Kingsman: The Secret Service.. the only film which features a badass Colin Firth taking out what can be described as a sea of people single handedly.. whilst still being stylishly suave.The film follows a basic formula.. but isn't your typical spy film its more than that. The action is on top form, the humour is on top form and the cast is perfection. As well as Colin Firth we get a brilliant performance from Samuel L Jackson as our villain Valentine. I like when a film gives a character their own traits that you can only see a certain actor pull off, and Sam Jackson nailed it as this funny as hell character, who does have the worst lisp i think i have ever heard. To top this off we have Michael Caine and Mark Strong on top form and surprisingly newcomer Taron Egerton as 'Eggsy' is absolutely brilliant, from streetwise chave to charming gentlemen. This was a brilliant start for the young actor.. give the man more work! Plus the lady with fricking razor blades as legs.. yeah she was awesome.I actually had the pleasure seeing this in cineworld's 4DX experience as well. This was fresh and cool to see. Made me feel i was in this film, when a gunshot was fired i felt it go past my head.. the seats moved (this was especially good during Eggsy's carjacking scene) and even bubbles filled the auditorium in one particular scene involving.. yes you saw this right.. exploding heads.All-in-all Kingsman is loud, badass, bodacious, stylish, funny and overall one of the greatest action films i have seen in my time, i highly recommend this. The action was very much like kick-ass so if you have seen that then you know what you're getting in to. One scene involving badass Colin Firth on top form in a church is a prime example of one such awesome scene and had me fixed to the screen the whole time in anticipation of what was coming next. At the end of a day when i feel this good about a film and i have already vowed multiple watchings that is when my highest rating is deserved which is why i feel Kingsman deserves a 10/10. Now i feel like putting on a suit and becoming a super spy. Not sure if thats a good idea but it has to be done. A new favourite for me for sure and the best cinematic experience since Whiplash.",10,3,10,17 February 2015
Minions," Banana.. that is all.
","I, like everyone else, love the minions. Since Despicable Me was released they have become a global phenomenon, but what is it about them that is so appealing? After seeing this film i still can't quite put my finger on it, yet I want to see a lot more of these little yellow, pill shaped lunatics who love to punch each other. The appeal is mostly their humour, yet it is something we have seen before. Minions (sort of) explains their origins and where they originated from and makes a solid entry into the franchise that people just can't get enough of.The story follows the Minions from the dawn of time. They were born to serve the biggest, baddest boss. But each boss they serve they end up killing somehow. Eventually the minions get depresses that there is nobody to serve. Kevin, Stuart and Bob take it upon themselves to go out and find their tribe a leader. After an encounter at Villain-Con they meet Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock) and go on an adventure around London to steal the Queen's crown. Pretty simple, yet this movie ultimately felt bigger than the previous entries. Having no Gru in the film leaves mostly gibberish as the dialogue. Sandra Bullock does a fantastic job as the villainous Scarlet Overkill and i really enjoyed her stop-motion three little pigs story. Jon Hamm, Michael Keaton and Steve Coogan also show up in roles that aren't really integral, but you can tell that each one of them has a lot of fun. At the end of it all though the Minions still keep this as their own movie and give us so many laughs. Some scenes in particular had me laughing a lot and with the humour being mostly visual this can be hard to do but is pulled off well here. One scene involving Stuart's hypno hat and some dancing tower guards had me in stitches and was easily the best part for me. Although one of the flaws i found was that whilst the film certainly feels bigger, some of it just feels unneeded and as if it were filler to make the film longer. With that being said, the film was a perfect length and i found that with Despicable Me 2 as well. It felt like the film was over within an hour, yet was still the longest in the franchise.At the end of the day, this is the minions at their best and if you're one of the very few who doesn't like them then this will not convert you. If you are anybody else i guarantee you some fun with this film. Plus the soundtrack was surprisingly awesome. I give Minions a solid 7.5 out of 10 bananas.",7,11,22,28 June 2015
Spectre," Slightly shaken, but definitely not stirred..
","Daniel Craig returns as James Bond agent 007 in SPECTRE the latest installment in this evergrowing franchise. He shows us he still has what it takes to be the suave superspy, even if this is tipped off to be the final time he steps into this role. If so he has left it a perfect ending for his run as Bond, and for the most part this film as a whole is another solid entry into the franchise and makes you sad to think Craig may not be returning in the inevitable sequel.This time Bond is facing his demons with SPECTRE an organisation which is the 'author of all his pain' according to our main villain played by Christoph Waltz who i will talk about more later. One of the main complaints about Skyfall was that there was no clear Bond girl (Moneypenny doesn't count). Well SPECTRE completely makes up for that with Dr. Madeline Swann played by Lea Seydoux. She provides an absolutely perfect Bond girl to reflect off of Daniel Craig's Bond. She is gorgeous, stylish and knows how to handle a gun which is touched on very well. In fact SPECTRE has one of the best casts i have ever seen from a Bond film. But there are times when the film comes to a slow grinding halt involving the 'termination' of the '00' programme from Andrew Scott's Q. This takes a lot of the limelight away from Ralph Fiennes M and Ben Whishaw's Q, but they both get their time to shine.Now, the performance from Christoph Waltz was great and he provides some great scenes, but by some i mean not a lot. I wish more time had been put into developing his character like Javier Bardem's Silva and the twist involving his character is something we did see coming which is unfortunate. We also get a ridiculous but highly entertaining and scene stealing performance from Dave Bautista who plays nothing more than a henchman but does it with such finesse that we don't care.Overall, SPECTRE is a great entry into the world of James Bond and i highly recommend seeing it. It gave me all i wanted with stunning locations, brilliant action sequences (the one at the very beginning is extremely tense and stands out with perfect cinematography). It may be slightly shaken at points, but it definitely isn't stirred!",8,5,14,7 November 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," The future belongs to the Mad.. What a lovely day!
","Mad Max: Fury Road, the newest from George Miller was a film i never had much interest in. I haven't really seen the others in the franchise (i say haven't really because i have seen about half of the original) but to be honest it isn't really nesscessary. Im not sure if this is a prequel or sequel but whatever it is doesn't really matter as this is quite possibly the action film of the year and has some of the best action sequences of the decade in fact.If i were to explain plot here it would seem very thin because in terms of plot there isn't a huge deal of it, although this isn't really a bad thing. It follows Max as played by Tom Hardy who does do a great job following the footsteps of Mel Gibson, as well as rebel Furiosa played by Charlize Theron at the top of her game. The two go on a journey to i guess restore order to the post-apocalyptic world we are introduced to from the start of the film. Everybody in this film does a really good job, Tom Hardy's Australian accent wasn't the best i have heard but he doesn't say a great deal, most of the dialogue does come from Theron's Furiosa and she really adds a moral contrast to his performance and they play well of each other, in fact this as much her film as it is Hardy's which i was worried about being called 'Mad Max' and all, but it doesn't bring the film down by a single notch.Now earlier on i mentioned that the film's plot isn't a very strong one. The reason this isn't a problem? Because the film is pretty much one huge action set piece. From the beginning to the very end the action does not stop. It is very much a road movie, but not a stereotypical road trip movie, it is a road movie where cars explode at every given moment and blood is splattered around with no remorse. I found out 80% of the films effects are practical and this does not surprise me at all because i had an extremely hard job pinpointing what is CGI and what isn't (with the exception of the prosthetic arm used by Theron's character). The real stand out for me was Nicolas Hult as Nux who is a character that you never know whether he is a villain or not. At first he seems insane, like our villain Immortal Joe (not the Toecutter), but you do get to know him and you do in fact feel for his character and even have sympathy for him and want him to succeed at points.By the end of the film, all the non stop action sequences that are thrown at us might seem too much, but they really aren't. Tom Hardy is as badass if not more than Mel Gibson (like i said though, i haven't seem all the Mad Max films) and Charlize Theron with the rest of the supporting cast do this film justice. You hear a lot about long overdue sequels spoiling what was once a great franchise but Fury Road just improves it. I hope that Jurrassic World and even Terminator Genysis can take a leaf out of this film's book. Mad Max:Fury Road deserves all the praise it is getting and is definitely one to get on blu-ray. See this film and you will have a Lovely Day as Nux would say. Plus, the flamethrower guitar dude was awesome, look out for him.",9,24,42,16 May 2015
13 Hours," It's slightly less Michael Bay.. with hints of more Michael Bay??
","I had high hopes for this one, i really did. Michael Bay's best is what i kept hearing, so i thought hey maybe it will break through the typical Michael Bay stereotype, which it does and doesn't at the same time. I will explain what i mean later on but in short i found myself bored to be honest. I was thinking to myself about all the other things i could be doing which isn't how i want to feel during a movie. I would compare my view on 13 hours to that of M. Night Shamylan's 'The Visit'. Completely different films but hear me out. Both films were described as the director's return to form. I watched both and by the end i wasn't sold on either of them. I came out feeling 'that was alright, but to be honest doesn't sell me that this director will be making great movies again in the future'. Bay's films are bad but i enjoyed films such as the first Transformers, heck i even enjoy Bad Boys II. They are stupid but a lot of fun. What Bay has tried to do here is make a serious Biopic, he did Pain and Gain and probably realised it was a bad idea to make it a comedy, but making a drama like this just comes across as boring and you cant even have fun with the 'badness' because here he tries too hard to be serious which is fine to do in a movie, but Bay doesn't really know how to do it well. I mean, it is a good story and a real life event involving Benghazi soldiers and the death of an ambassador which could have translated well. But making it 2 hrs 24 minutes, not a great deal happened and a lot of it was filler.At times in the movie we are watching something really exciting and i think, the movie really could redeem itself here, then the next scene is something really boring that i wasn't interested in. This happens for the entire runtime which is almost like watching 2 different films. One scene involves the main character running across a battlefield in slow motion with a beautiful sunset behind him whilst things are constantly exploding behind him. To me it perfectly describes Bay as a director. Brilliant style, poor substance. The film wasn't terrible, but nothing overly memorable happens which has me sold that he is a good filmmaker either, so in the end it's just an average film that doesn't stand among the rest of the true story films out today.",5,6,17,4 February 2016
The Martian," The best sci-fi movie for years!
","The Martian follows the story of Mark Watney, an astronaut left behind on a place where nothing lives or grows, Mars. For most of the runtime (this is quite a long film at 2 and a half hours) we spend time on this planet with Watney, and with such a brilliant performance from Matt Damon it is a pleasure to do so.As soon as the film starts we are thrown straight into the action and feel what it's like to be in Watney's shoes. What we are given is an incredibly intense and realistic portrayal of loneliness and desperation from Damon and director Ridley Scott. It is also fascinating to watch Watney do his 'sciency stuff' where he actually creates his own water and grows his own food, which is thought to be impossible on Mars. It is ironic that the film shows us this in the same week water actually was discovered on Mars, but even so it is so interesting to see these aspects. The supporting cast also do a great job, especially Watney's crew who just want to get him back to earth. Jessica Chastain, Michael Pena, Kate Mara.. the list goes on and they all shine as well as Jeff Daniels who we really don't know whether he is one of the good guys or not. The standout however comes from my man Donald Glover, i love the guy and he steals every scene he is in even if it is only for a short time. Overall, see this film. It is one if the best 2015 has to offer and remains in my top 5 of the year so far. It was like Interstellar meets castaway with less fantasy and more realism. One question though.. why does Hollywood keep letting Matt Damon get lost?! Have they not learnt by now?",9,3,8,29 October 2015
Furious 7," Freaking Insane! and a beautiful tribute..
","I can never recall a time in my life i could have said i was looking forward to a 7th installment of a movie.. i was young when The Fast and The Furious was released and if i went back to when i first saw it I never would have felt a 7th film would have been good.. but Fast & Furious 7 proved me wrong and it turned out to be one of the most action packed, over the top, ridiculous and downright entertaining movies for a long time. The film and its crew had to overcome a tragic and hard problem which was the sad passing of series veteran Paul Walker. I knew him only from this series but i have heard he was one of the nicest guys working in Hollywood. The ending of this film, without spoilers, was the most perfect and beautiful tribute that could have been done and I think that if he had seen this movie himself then he would be proud. It brought me to tears and i'm not afraid to admit that. Furious 7 picks up directly after the events of the 6th movie (sounds ridiculous saying that) and we are introduced to Deckard Shaw played by Jason Statham who is on the path to revenge after Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew took out his brother. What i like about this film is that it actually makes Tokyo Drift relevant. In my opinion 2 Fast 2 Furious and Tokyo Drift are not good movies and they had no reason to exist but the 5th movie brought back characters from the 2nd who are some of the best and this one takes place after the events of Tokyo Drift starting with the death of Hans who originally died in the third film.. its a confusing timeline but the beauty of Fast & Furious is that it knows this and we as an audience have a lot of fun untangling the timeline which could not work with any other series. Anyway, this leads us onto 2 revenge paths with Statham after the crew and the crew after him. In order to defeat him they must get the 'God's eye' which is a device that can find anyone in the world in seconds, hired by Kurt Russell on top form we are given a thrill ride which is quite possibly the most entertaining film of the franchise yet.The film is the most ridiculous and insane too.. we have seen the crew take down a huge plane on the biggest runway in the world and destroy half of Brazil with a huge safe. Here we are treated to Skydiving Cars and a huge street race/fight involving drones but the most insane part for me was Vin Diesel and Paul Walker jumping across 3 skyscrapers in Abu Dubai in a supercar that seemed like it was built for this madness. Seriously, it was intense and i was on the edge of my seat. The only thing i missed in this film was more of Dwayne Johnson. He appeared in Fast Five as Hobbs and became my favourite part of the series but for a lot of this film he is out of action.. but this is after a brutal and downright awesome fight between himself and Statham. I knew that from the moment Statham receives an uppercut to the face and gets up to continue fighting that this would be incredibly unrealistic.. who could ever survive that. Plus the climax was incredibly well done considering the circumstances. It would have been no easy job to continue without Walker and you could tell where things had to be changed but i will not criticise for this because I respect that they managed to get the film finished.. plus seeing Dwayne Johnson handle a minigun like it was a leafblower was absolutely incredible. I feel lot less focus was given to the driving sequences as cars were either flying or we had extended fight sequences.. these were well shot but felt a bit repetitive because the same camera trick where the camera flips upside down was used which looked cool but in my opinion happened too much. Other than that I liked this installment a hell of a lot.. Michelle Rodriguez and Ronda Housey going bare knuckles was a treat to see in particular. If the series ended now i would be incredibly pleased as I'm sure a lot of fans would too. A beautiful monologue from Vin Diesel.brought me and many others to tears and it will be an ending to remember for years to come. A beautiful tribute to Paul and an amazing ending to a freaking insane movie! RIP Paul Walker",8,2,5,4 April 2015
