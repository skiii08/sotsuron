Requiem for a Dream," Don't watch this movie unless you are prepared to walk outside the walls that your comfortable societal living allows you to erect around yourself.
","I am personally glad that this movie did not win any oscars as the academy seems to be bought and sold by the blockbuster movie of the year. Lets face it Gladiator WAS good but it was still just another macho hackfest that taught no-one anything. And Julia Roberts had nothing on Ellen Burstyn. this movie was refreshing in that it was unafraid and uncensored. This is life at its best and worst it speaks to every person who sees it and asks, What is your fix? what is the one thing you do or use to feel some sort of stability or peace in life? what would you do if it was gone? How far would you go to get it back?",10,0,1,24 November 2001
