The Blair Witch Project," If You Go Down To the Woods in the 90s...
","The Blair Witch Project, the film that, more or less, created the Found Footage Horror sub-genre; paving the way for the likes of the Paranormal Activities, the RECs, and Cloverfield. But don't judge it on those (really quite average) movies, because The Blair Witch Project is extraordinarily terrifying. Even writing this now, reminiscing about the film is filling me with fear. It really is that scary.We join Heather, her friend Josh and Mike (hired because he can work a video camera) as they adventure in to the woods to find out more about the eponymous Blair Witch, aiming to make a cheap documentary type movie on the fairly blurred subject. As you can expect, things soon get creepy...Genre conventions pop up about the place from the off: unwitting teens, small town-folk, and so on, but it really just works as the characters (keeping their real life names as in Found Footage tradition) bicker and gradually break down from fear.And there's a lot of darkness. As the kids sit within their tent, in a hope that the creepy noises outside won't get them, we, the audience, are forced to watch a blank screen, just listening to growls outside and the scared banter inside. Just like Paranormal Activity, something the makers of that film quite right jumped on, your eyes dart around this screen, literally looking at nothing, as you wait, petrified, for something to jump out at you.And that's exactly where the film quite rightly collects its haters. Not full of conventional scares, you're supposed to believe in the characters' fears, their terror of what COULD be out there. You're tasked with believing in the possible evil out there, as opposed to bluntly throwing it at you. Yes, there are bits here and there, visible to us which are horrifying, but the real fear? Our fantastic imagination. Today, almost 15 years on, The Blair Witch Project may well be devalued by its less scary descendants (avoid Apollo 18 at all costs), and perhaps with repeat viewings it could easily become tame. But if today's Found Footage movies are Blair Witch's children, then TBWP is their far smarter, pitch black and, most importantly, scarier dad.Watch it with the lights off.Twitter: @JonnyJonJon1",8,1,2,21 January 2014
Evil Dead," Give Me Back My (Cash in) Hand!
","Let me start by saying that I am a massive Evil Dead fan, and believe that Evil Dead II is one of the greatest sequels ever. With that said, I went in to the Evil Dead Remake, boomstick in hand ready to shoot myself when I sensed a bad movie.Evil Dead 2013 continues Hollywood's sluggish attempt to bring back every horror movie you ever loved and squash it, taking as much joy and charm away from its original film that it actually pains you. Surely, they would have learned from My Bloody Valentine 3D, right? Wrong.The story here is pretty much the same, and actually probably more coherent to begin with than ED 1 & 2 - as five teens go to a Cabin In The Woods to support their drug addicted member through the next few days as she tries to go cold turkey. Unfortunately for her and the rest of Scooby Doo-esque gang of friends, an evil book is discovered... The main problem with this film is its lack of charisma. All of the fresh faced leads are useless and stereotypical to the genre. Gone is the amazing/terrible acting display of the brilliant/awful Bruce Campbell, replaced instead with 'Shiloh Fernandez'. I'm fine with bad acting (look back at any of your favourite horror films - they will all have someone with the facial expressions of a tree, or 'Lacktors' if you will), but apart from looking pretty, Fernandez has literally nothing otherwise that stops you from wanting to see him killed by something horrible in these evil woods. Gone too is literally any kind of humour. hile ED2 had this bizarre twisted funny bone running through it, this movie doesn't even attempt it. No lines, no puppets, no deer head, nothing. This isn't a bad thing, because I'd argue that Army of Darkness (the third in the Evil Dead series) went a little too over the top. But not even a line? A sly reference to the original? Nope. Nothing. Going back to other bad horror remakes, I can remember that even Friday the 13th 2009 had a few stabs (!) at it. On saying that, I did laugh twice at unintentionally hysterical parts, both involving Jane Levy. Our addicted heroine of sorts, while becoming possessed, she witnesses lots of strange things, and just look out for her reflection... it's stupidly hilarious. Which leads me on to the deaths. This film was given an 18 certificate in the UK, something so rare these days, which'll be a result of this being actually a mash up of both ED part 1 and 2, pilfering the best bits from both of them. With that comes lots of the makeshift weapons used in both, tweaked ever so slightly. Like the originals, this movie's best moments come from the practical effects: lots of blood, tongues, hands, etc, with one scene involving a razor blade standing out, and giving you your only scene where you stop and go 'Wow, that's not terrible and looks actually quite good'. Unfortunately, that is the only highlight. Otherwise, each death is really rather flat, dull even.If you want to do a remake involve George Romero (Dawn of the Dead 2004 and The Crazies 2010 were both inferior but great), otherwise please please stay away, as films like this are straight up painful to sit through.In the Evil Dead movies the characters are possessed by evil spirits and turned in to monsters. It's just a shame Evil Dead 2013 has been taken over by something so unscary, lifeless and frankly boring that it makes you want to cut off your own hand and chase yourself out of the cinema with it. @JonnyJonJon1",2,2,2,23 January 2014
