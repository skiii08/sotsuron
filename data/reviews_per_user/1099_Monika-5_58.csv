Saturday Night Fever," OK
","The highlights of this film were the music and dancing scenes (obviously), Tony and Stephanie rehearsing their dance number in the studio, the opening sequence with Tony strutting down the street to 'Staying Alive', and my favorite line of the movie: 'He hits my hair!'And did every other word have to be a swear word? The only version I've seen of this movie is the R version; maybe if I viewed the PG rated version I'd enjoy it better.",Null,0,0,4 October 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," OK but not great
","The movie didn't compare to the others, and I hope the next one will be better, but it wasn't bad. I hope that Ewan McGregor will play Obi Wan next time, too.I personally didn't have anything against Jar Jar Binks, the character itself. He WAS in a few too many scenes, but what annoyed me out of my mind was his stupid Jamaican accent!!! PLEASE, let's not see Jar Jar come back!!!",Null,1,2,23 July 1999
Ghost," Pretty good
","Ghost is one of the rare films that can appeal to both men and women...there are fights, blood, gore, comedy, drama, romance, mystery, music, and intrigue. I got a huge kick out of Whoopi Goldberg's character, and I agree with the previous reviewer who commented on the extraordinary chemistry displayed by Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore. All the actors here, including Vincent Schavelli (who I recognized right away as Mr. Vargas from Fast Times at Ridgemont High) as the subway ghost are great. My favorite scene would be the vase-making then love-making scene set to Unchained Melody, which in my opinion is one of the greatest love songs ever. I really didn't agree with the spiritual, life after death issues displayed in the movie, and I did think the ending could have been better. Other than that, the film wasn't bad. It really does show the power of love.",Null,1,2,18 August 2000
Raiders of the Lost Ark," It still thrills and chills
","This was the big budget adventure that started it all: spinning off two sequels, a TV show, and still influencing films today (The Mummy movies, for example). Offering adventure, chases, sneering villians, goofy sidekicks, romance, stunts, and lots of humor, it's not hard to see why ROTLA is such a beloved movie. Could anyone else besides Harrison Ford really play Indiana Jones? I loved the chemistry and fire and ice relationship between Indiana and Marion (Karen Allen), and of course Indiana's classic line 'I HATE snakes!' It would be great if the whole Indiana Jones trilogy was re-released in theaters, much as ET is going to be in a couple of weeks. Steven Spielburg and George Lucas, are you listening??",Null,0,1,5 March 2002
Erin Brockovich," The most important film and role for Julia Roberts
","I saw this movie at the urging of my sister, who was so impressed that she saw it twice. I was a little skeptical but I'm glad I saw it. Ms. Roberts literally puts her heart and soul in this film (I'm sure she was exhausted when the film wrapped) and I'm sure she will win the Golden Globe and garner an Oscar nod. Albert Finney and Aaron Eckart and the rest of the cast shine. The script and direction is sharp, dramatic with hints of dark humor, and the only complaint I really have is that the film ran a bit too long. One of the best movies of 2000!",Null,1,1,11 May 2000
Wayne's World," Surprisingly funny
","I watched this for a film class. I'm not big on Mike Myers, but this film was funny! Wayne and Garth (Dana Carvey) are a not too bright but effective team, when they set out to settle the score with an evil TV producer (Rob Lowe). Along the way, they make searingly caustic remarks about pop culture (Bee Gees) to commercialism (Pepsi...'I speak for the new generation!') Great songs are also used, including 'Dream Weaver' and the song that brought headbanging mainstream (sort of), 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. One of the (very) few SNL movies that worked.",Null,2,5,11 March 2002
Citizen Kane," A film noir classic
","I had to watch this film in one of my college classes, and thought it was a triumph in the department of using light and shadows, an absorbing script (the life of a cutthoat newspaper heir), classic performances, and I believe this was a breakthrough in the writer/director/producer/star in the movies. Orson Welles made a classic, and the Rosebud mystery will keep you guessing through the whole movie if you've never seen it before. One for the ages!",Null,1,4,4 March 2002
Shakespeare in Love," Good but overrrated
","This movie is a visual treat and I loved seeing 'Romeo and Juliet' acted out at the end. Gwyneth Paltrow was a treat as usual (she is indeed 'the muse of Mirimax films'), and Ben Affleck, Geoffrey Rush and Judi Densch were hysterical in supporting roles. However, I think this film was overrated. I didn't think Ms. Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes had chemistry (I could have done without all the bedroom scenes). I don't think it should have won the Oscar over 'Saving Private Ryan'. I think Meryl Streep (as a mother stricken with terminal cancer in 'One True Thing') and Cate Blanchett (as Queen Elizabeth) had stronger, tougher roles to play and were more deserving of the Oscar than Ms. Paltrow.But it is worth a look, and is an entertaining story.",Null,0,1,2 August 1999
Beauty and the Beast," Magical
","Who can resist this beautiful story? I love the fact that even though Belle hated Beast at first, she saw underneath that he was a kind and gentle soul, and didn't care what he looked like on the outside! And what girl hasn't known a Gaston in their lives? I thought it was so great how he was put in his place! All the voiceovers are amazing, especially Robby Benson as Beast. Another Disney masterpiece.",Null,59,77,17 February 2000
Elizabeth," A thrilling movie
","This movie captured the time period wonderfully. The scenery and costumes were magnificent, as was Cate Blanchett's performance as Queen Elizabeth I. She wonderfully transformed Elizabeth from a naive, playful girl into the no-nonsense but fair queen who ruled England with an iron hand. Maybe this movie didn't use history all that well, but is certainly worth watching.",Null,0,0,3 August 1999
The Mummy," What a fun movie!
","I had a lot of fun watching this movie. See it on a lazy, rainy day especially. It's goofy, cheesy fun. Brendan Fraser had me in stitches, and so did the goofy bad guys. The scenery and special effects were great, too. It's a lot of fun. Go rent it!",Null,0,0,4 January 2000
The Others," Viva Nicole Kidman!
","Coming right off her popular turn in Moulin Rouge, Nicole Kidman firmly established herself as an excellent and very versatile actress in 2001. She makes the movie, and as Grace, she seems to be Grace Kelly reincarnated as the quiet, devoted, but frightened and overprotective mother of two while her husband is lost at war. Excellent scenery and props of a creepy haunted house and a housekeeping staff that may not be what they appear keep the film on its toes, and it delivers an ending that rivals only the Sixth Sense in surprise endings in recent history. If Nicole Kidman can keep up the momentum following her two triumphs of 2001, who knows how far she can go??",Null,0,0,4 March 2002
Chicken Run," Funny!
","I didn't laugh out loud at many parts in this movie, but I did chuckle and smile a lot. Like a previous reviewer mentioned, this is the Toy Story 2 of this year. The claymation is outstanding, the voice-over work is first rate (especially Mel Gibson in a tailor made role!) and the script is funny. As a bonus, the film is fairly short and glides by short and sweet. One of the best movies of the year!",Null,0,0,28 June 2000
Home Alone," Great fun, especially around the holidays
","I still remember seeing this movie in a packed theater in 1990, right around Christmas. I was 11, and was with my mom, my sister and her best friend. EVERYONE in the theater had a great time. We've owned the video for many years and watch it several times a year, especially around Christmas. The gags are clever, silly, and even painful to watch (I have yet to meet someone who can look directly into the TV when Daniel Stern steps into the nail barefoot). And I still cry with laughter when Macauley Culkin puts the tarantula on Stern's face and we hear his bloodcurdling, feminine shriek! I really liked the neighbor Mr. Marley and I found the family bickering very realistic. A must see, especially around the holidays.",Null,0,1,23 March 2000
Forrest Gump," Good but way overrated
","I still don't understand what all the hype about Forrest Gump is all about. It's a good film, but REALLY! The cast is all good, with Tom Hanks in fine form as usual, and Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, and Sally Field are all very well cast. The best scene in my opinion is where Forrest tells Jenny that he knows what love is. A good movie but still too much hype.",Null,1,3,27 February 2000
"Monsters, Inc."," Disney/Pixar does it again! (minor spoilers)
","The one-two punch of Disney/Pixar delivers another touching, yet side-splitting film that can be enjoyed by adults and kids alike.
The Monsters, Inc. industry, in which monsters scare kids and use their screams as energy to fuel the town, runs like any other busy corporation. There's voice mail, time cards, even a scary secretary, who is the bane of green eyeball Mike (in a hysterical voice performance by Billy Crystal). Life is going swimmingly until the scariest monster of all, Sully (John Goodman, also outstanding) discovers that a little girl has snuck into a world where she doesn't belong. Boo turns his world upside down!The animation is awesome, and funny characters such as Lydia, the scary receptionist and especially the abominable snowman light up the screen. I could find nothing objectionable, and even if you don't have kids there is enough funny lines and touching moments to entertain anyone. I recommend it!",Null,0,1,4 March 2002
Bridget Jones's Diary," Totally Enjoyable! (minor spoilers)
","The major chick flick of 2001! Renee Zellweger was hysterically funny as Bridget, and her more subdued moments of loneliness, self-pity, and drunkenness also spoke volumes to those of us in singledom. Classic songs 'All By Myself', 'Without You', 'It's Raining Men', 'Me and Mrs. Jones', 'Ain't No Mountain High Enough' and 'I'm Every Woman' are used as hysterical backdrops to crucial scenes. Colin Firth and Hugh Grant are also perfectly cast as the two men in her life. It's nice to have Hugh Grant play the slimy sleazeball for once, and he's sure more believable here than in Sense and Sensibility! I loved the change in Firth's character, and I especially loved the light in his eyes and his shyness and warmth take the forefront. The last half hour may be predictable, but the slowly growing development of true love hasn't been as well done in a film I've seen since While You Were Sleeping. It's rare that an actress comes along that can handle goofy comedy OR wrenching drama. Renee Zellweger can do both. It's a testament to her that this movie worked as well as it did. Good job!",Null,0,0,11 March 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A pleasant surprise!
","I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and I've never even read any of the Tolkien books! The breathtaking visuals (I'm a sucker for good visuals) were more than enough to earn my approval, and the outstanding cast (Elijah Wood, Ian McKellan, Sean Astin, Viggo Mortensen, etc.) went above and beyond the call of duty to put it over. The only thing I disliked was the length. Three hours and ten minutes was a bit too much for me. But it didn't detract from my experience one bit. I loved it!",Null,0,0,11 March 2002
Grease," Always a musical classic
","John and Olivia are at their best. I love the songs and the dancing, but there was one thing I didn't like. Sandy made herself into a smoking biker chick to make Danny stay with her. They did the same thing in 'Grease 2'. What's the moral of these movies? That you CAN judge a book by its cover? And to all those who say Olivia is the 'Oldest High Schooler' from this movie (she was 29 or 30 at the time), Stockard Channing, who played Rizzo, was 34 at the time. Go figure!",Null,1,3,4 August 1999
Footloose," Terrific 80s flick!
","This film boasts outstanding performances by Kevin Bacon and John Lithgow, a plausible plot (certainly more plausible than the plot in Flashdance!) and great 80s music! I love the fact that while the Kevin Bacon character was a rebel, he stood up for what he felt was right and did so in a non-violent way. Also the way the adults, especially the Lithgow character, were treated with sympathy and respect. I love the scene where the Kevin Bacon character teaches the Chris Penn character to dance to the tune of 'Let's Hear It For The Boy'!",Null,2,5,14 April 2000
The Shining," Ummm...
","Well, what can I say about The Shining that no one has said before? Jack Nicholson goes so bonkers it's hysterical. He and Faye Dunaway in Mommie Dearest, in my book, win the awards for Funniest Performances Ever. My eleventh grade math teacher had a policy with our class...if we all got at least C's on every test, we got to see a movie in class. The policy worked like a charm. One time, we watched this one. Boy did we have a ball watching this one! Heeeeeeeeeeeeeere's Johnny!!!",Null,2,3,16 June 2000
Pearl Harbor," Could've been better
","Aside from some truly awesome visuals to recreate the actual attack on Pearl Harbor, this punishingly long movie ultimately fails. Instead of using any of the powerful true stories from the people who experienced the attack, a fictional, drippy love triangle story is formed (with no chemistry at any angle). Cuba Gooding Jr. is woefully underused. The script is filled with cliches and sappy dialogue, and the love scene between Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett is just plain laughable. The visuals, special effects, costumes, and supporting performances by Gooding, Alec Baldwin, and Jon Voight are all high points. The three leads are not horrible, but the script lets them down. It was a good summer movie, but ultimately will not be remembered.",Null,0,1,5 March 2002
Flashdance," 80s flash and trash
","Sure, Flashdance will never make the AFI's Top 100, but it has an infectious charm. Jennifer Beals is really only so-so in the leading role, and her leading man Michael Nouri is no better off, but it doesn't matter. What does matter here is the great music! Really, the whole film is played like a 90-minute ad for MTV! Laugh at the dopey plot and listen to the great tunes. Great film to earmark the 80s.",Null,34,64,14 April 2000
Gone with the Wind," A classic soap opera
","I remember watching GWTW years ago with my grandmother on TV. I can only imagine how wonderful it must have been to experience this film on the big screen! Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable, Hattie McDaniel and Olivia De Havilland are all perfectly cast and the supporting players shine also, especially Ona Munson, who played  Belle Watling, the hooker Rhett was friends with. I have to agree that Leslie Howard showed no charisma whatsoever  as Ashley Wilkes. What woman in her right mind would want to be with a dull wet mop like Ashley instead of someone handsome, charismatic and exciting like Rhett Butler?Anyway, a classic on every level. The color and costumes are amazing. Will always be a special movie to me.",Null,3,4,9 October 2000
Legends of the Fall," Boring and depressing
","This film has good things to offer...awesome cinematography, good actors (especially Anthony Hopkins, Henry Thomas and Aidan Quinn), and a decent score, but that's about all it has. The movie is very, very depressing (don't see it if you have serious emotional issues), and it's also very dull. The dialogue is cheesy and the story is predictable. I wouldn't recommend it, unless you like Brad Pitt or the other actors.",Null,2,8,16 April 2000
Man on the Moon," Jim Carrey deserves an Oscar!
","This was a great film, and Jim Carrey was absolutely perfect in the role of Andy. He is so convincing you forget that he ISN'T Andy. The script, direction, and Danny DeVito's supporting performance are also top notch. It was also great to see the Taxi cast, especially reinacting scenes from the show. This is one of the best films of the year. Don't miss it!",Null,0,0,23 December 1999
The Little Mermaid," Gorgeous
","Ariel is a fiery, independent teenage mermaid who falls in love with a prince. She literally makes a deal with the devil to get her man. I love how sweet Ariel is with Eric, especially when she can't talk! Sebastian, Scuttle, and Flounder are all very funny, the animation, voice-overs and music are incredible! Who can resist the urge to sing and dance to 'Under The Sea'? A fun, enjoyable movie that the whole family will love and treasure.",Null,41,56,17 February 2000
Good Will Hunting," I agree...
","I agree with the last reviewer; the F word was used in about every other sentence. I ended up muting 3/4 of the movie so I wouldn't have to hear all that foul language.  Which is too bad because this movie had real promise, then fell flat.  I was disappointed when I saw the movie; it was nowhere near as good as I'd hoped.  Robin Williams, though, was phenomenal and stole the movie away from Damon and Affleck.  I was happy that he won the Supporting Actor Oscar.  He was the only bright spot of this overrated movie.",Null,1,3,17 July 1999
Moulin Rouge!," Totally overrated
","I really wanted to enjoy this film. The comments here seem to be straight down the middle. You'll either love it or you'll loathe it. Granted, Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor are not bad (even though I didn't see any chemistry between them), they both have decent singing voices (although a little of MacGregor's singing goes a long way with me), and once the Duke puts two and two together, the film becomes better and more tolerable to watch. Some of the musical sequences were downright painful (i.e. the 'Like A Virgin' scene made me want to reach for a barf bag). It would have been great if this had been a satire film, or a spoof, but as a straight up serious film it lost me. If the Academy wanted to nominate Nicole Kidman, they should have recognized her incredible turn in The Others (a FAR superior film).",Null,1,3,11 March 2002
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Creepy fun!
","May be Tim Burton's best film. The animation is just spectacular! The music and exceptional voice work just adds to the perfection. An enjoyable and clever film, and Jack Skellington's adventures are fun to watch. Listen closely for the voiceover work of Whose Line is it Anyway's Greg Proops.",Null,0,2,11 October 2000
Caddyshack," OK
","I finally saw Caddyshack, and it really isn't as funny as I thought it would be. I agree with the previous reviewer that Rodney Dangerfield saves the film. I love his line about the hat: 'Looks good on you though!' And Ted Knight is funny in his scenes with Rodney.The rest of the movie pretty much falls flat, mostly because of the story of the Danny character. (yawn)Love the gopher and Kenny Loggins' song 'I'm Alright'!",Null,1,4,16 March 2000
For Love of the Game," Fouls out
","As a baseball fan, and a fan of a good love story, I expected to enjoy this movie. But I'd take the baseball game story line over the dull romance any day. Kevin Costner and Kelly Preston had NO chemistry, and the 'love' story made me snooze. I did enjoy John C. Reilly in a supporting role. I've yet to see a movie that can truly, deftly combine a sports story and a romance. This isn't it. Avoid.",Null,0,1,5 March 2002
Major League," A must see for baseball fans!
","This movie hits close to home because I live in the Cleveland area and am a HUGE Indians fan! I remember back in the days when Cleveland and especially the Tribe were laughingstocks...oh, back to the movie, hehe...Bob Uecker is hysterically funny as the Indians' radio announcer, and Tom Berenger looks very comfortable and relaxed as the veteran catcher. Charlie Sheen is funny, and Rene Russo makes the most of her small role as Berenger's girlfriend. Wesley Snipes was great as the Kenny Lofton-esque Willie Mays Hayes, and the rest of the cast was great.The script offers no suprises whatsoever, but it's still fun to watch. Recommended especially to Indians fans.",Null,0,4,25 March 2000
"Girl, Interrupted"," Very good
","Winona Ryder, Angelina Jolie and Brittney Murphy turn in the performances of their careers in this film, and Ms. Jolie truly deserved her supporting actress Golden Globe. I haven't read Susanna Kaysen's book, so I'm not sure how accurate the movie is, but the film is haunting, creepy, with several humorous moments to lighten it up a bit. Love the musical score. Whoopi Goldberg does what she can with her small role as a nurse. If you are looking for a reason to see 'Girl, Interrupted', Ms. Jolie steals the film with her heart-wrenching role as Lisa.",Null,1,1,14 February 2000
Toy Story," Very good!
","As much as I enjoyed this film, I think the sequel was even better. One can certainly relate to Woody's jealousy of Buzz, and cheer when they've found the perfect best friend. I loved it when all the toys put evil Sid in his place, and I'm even happier that Sid wasn't in the sequel! Best of all is that Woody and Buzz never give up. Great animation and voice-overs!",Null,2,3,17 February 2000
The Graduate," Good but overrated
","This is a very interesting movie, although the politics and culture of the times etc. may be a bit lost on me since I'm only 21. But Dustin Hoffman's character is a lazy jerk no matter what, and Elaine Robinson is a complete ditz. If you learned your new boyfriend had (repeatedly) slept with your mother, would you ever want to see him again, much less run out of your own wedding to another man to run away with him? I think not.
Anyway, I agree Anne Bancroft made Mrs. Robinson a delicious character. You never knew what she was going to do next. I liked how she let it slip how she had to give up her own dreams once she got pregnant with Elaine. I also agree that she was relegated to the role of villainess after the middway point of the film. Anne Bancroft is easily the best part of the film.I also like the direction of the scene where Ben interrupts Elaine's wedding. He keeps screaming her name, and despite all the commotion around her (her parents, namely), Elaine sees and hears only him. And all is silent once she screams 'Ben!' Then the chaos begins.I also think Dustin Hoffman and Katharine Ross gave very good perfomances despite the fact I disliked their characters. And the Simon and Garfunkel songs are also treasures. A good movie, but I just don't think it was great.",Null,0,2,8 October 2000
The Mummy Returns," Good but I still like the first movie better
","I enjoyed the Mummy Returns, but I wish that Rick and Evie (Brandon Fraser and Rachel Weisz, who again share incredible chemistry) hadn't been saddled with a kid. They just didn't seem as fun as parents, and the kid came off as a brat. The wonderful John Hannah reprises his role as Evie's wimpy brother and is good for a lot of laughs, and in his brief role as the Scorpion King the Rock entertains. With the Rock, Fraser and Hannah all in the same film, I'm sure plenty of ladies were entertained by that alone! The same rollicking adventures follow, but they don't seem as fresh or as fun as in the original. Still, all the performances are entertaining and the pop culture spoofs (James Bond, Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Peter Sellers) are priceless. Viva The Mummy!",Null,0,0,4 March 2002
Toy Story 2," LOVED it!
","This movie was far superior to the original (which was also great). I grew up watching Tim Allen play the Tool Man, but I think his Buzz is a much more lovable character! And who could resist Tom Hanks as Woody! The whole story was excellent, and I love the new character Jessie! And Bullseye the Horse is really cool, too! My favorite parts: the 3 green aliens ('You have saved our lives, we are eternally grateful'), the toys driving the pizza delivery car to the airport, and the truth about Buzz Lightyear's father (I almost split a gut laughing at that)! See this movie! I give it a 10!",Null,0,1,30 December 1999
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Good rehash of the original
","Do Harry and Marv have the best pain tolerance in the world or what??? Ouch! Anyway, this is a good time filler, but it is in no way original. It's just that the action takes place in New York. The same cast is back, and they all do a pretty good job, given the material. But HOW could these crooks survive all these awful booby traps and escape with nary a scratch, even a broken bone? I know you have to sometimes suspend belief while watching movie, but this is too much! Anyway, not a bad film, just not very original and believable. I think the McAllisters just decided to spend all their Christmases at home after this, thank goodness!",Null,1,2,23 March 2000
Life Is Beautiful," Outstanding
","This may be one of the best films ever made. I've never seen a movie with such a balance of hysterical comedy and serious drama. Roberto Benigni totally deserved his Oscars. People on this site have said such negative things about him and this film. Mr. Benigni had a lot of guts to make this film, and there's not another film like it. He handled both the comedy and drama aspects beautifully. I loved the beautiful cinematography, scenery, and the characters. This movie is magnificent in every way. Don't miss it!",Null,235,304,3 January 2000
Groundhog Day," PRICELESS!
","You'll laugh until you cry watching 'Groundhog Day'. Bill Murray plays a weatherman who, on February 2, Groundhog's Day, repeats that day of his life over and over. My favorite parts are where Phil wakes up to 'I Got You Babe' every single time, and every single time he meets Ned. Great fun!",Null,0,0,29 February 2000
Titanic," Special effects breathtaking, acting is another story
","This movie had great effects, great costumes, and the music still sends shivers down my spine (and I don't mean the song sung by Celine Dion). The sinking scene made me gasp in horror and sadness, because I knew it had to be so much worse for the actual people on the Titanic in 1912. I felt helpless sitting in the theater, and you could see all too well this mammoth tragedy could have been averted.The acting was overrated. No offense to Leonardo, but I don't think he's a very good actor and I'm one of the few young women who doesn't find him very attractive. I didn't think either Jack and Rose were likeable characters (most of the movie, I wanted to smack Rose, who was an obnoxious brat). The drawing scene and sex scene in the car were tasteless and unnecessary. Kathy Bates was wonderful as usual, but the best performance was delivered by Frances Fisher as Ruth. You could tell exactly what she was thinking and she didn't have to say a word.This was a very good movie but I think it could have been even better. And I think James Cameron's acceptance speech at the Oscars was insulting and embarrassing.",Null,1,2,3 August 1999
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Frightening...
","...but not for the reason you'd think! As one of the friendly people who sells you your tickets when you come to the theater, I worked day shift the morning Harry Potter opened. Imagine the pit in my stomach when I came to work and saw the immense crowd planted by the doors. At 9:30 AM!!! As someone who'd also worked through Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, Austin Powers 2, Shrek, Pokemon (1,2, and 3), Toy Story 2 and several other biggies, Harry Potter was an experience all unto itself for the entire 2 months we had it.A couple of days later, I took my cousin and a couple of her little friends to see it. I've never read the books and I'm not even going to go into the whole controversy. The visuals were awesome, the performances were incredible all around (especially by the three young leads), but the story didn't really hold my interest, especially given the 2 hour 45 minute time length, which was just too long. Especially for a film mainly geared toward kids. But my little entourage enjoyed it, so that's all that mattered.",Null,0,0,4 March 2002
It's a Wonderful Life," The best Christmas movie ever!
","What a wonderful film. Sure, it ends happily but it is also a very dark, dramatic film. NO ONE could've played the unlucky hero, George Bailey as wonderfully as James Stewart did. I could never imagine anyone else playing him, and a wonderful supporting cast backs him up beautifully. Who hasn't felt like George at some point in our lives and wondered how our loved ones would be if we'd never been born? The saga of George Bailey  is a wonderful story to behold. A must-see, especially at Christmas.",Null,1,4,9 October 2000
A Beautiful Mind," The Best All-Around Movie I've seen since Sixth Sense (minor spoilers)
","I was totally blown away by Ron Howard's masterpiece 'A Beautiful Mind'. I was so touched by the film that I went to the mall to buy Sylvia Nasar's book. Russell Crowe completely loses himself in the role of a mathematics genius who learns the reality and delusions of the world he sees are not necessarily the real world. I thought Crowe was incredible, Ed Harris is bone-chilling, and Jennifer Connelly was magnificent in her supporting role as Crowe's wife who desperately tries to love and support her husband as he battles his demons. I was mildly annoyed to learn that there were quite a few liberties taken with John Nash's life in the film, but I learned that after, so it did not affect my viewing experience at all. I adored this film and I'm sure Oscar will award it richly. A Beautiful Mind truly shows the redeeming power of love.",Null,0,2,4 March 2002
When Harry Met Sally...," LOVED it!
","This is one of my all-time favorite films. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are magic together, and the two characters they play are so real and tangible.Of course, most of the credit of the film's success go to the two leads of course, but the fine supporting performances from Carrie 'Princess Leia' Fisher and Bruno Kirby, the warm, funny, charming script by Nora Ephron and Rob Reiner's direction mesh perfectly and create a wonderful film.I can really relate to Harry and Sally's romantic heartaches, and how they cry on each other's shoulders. Also I felt that their gradual attraction was played realistically. The last twenty or so minutes leading up to the big romantic finale will have you both cheering and crying!My favorite line is, after Harry and Sally spot Harry's ex-wife and her new boyfriend Ira while singing in the Sharper Image store, Harry yells: 'Six years later, you find yourself singing 'Surrey With the Fringe On Top' in front of Ira!!!'Highly recommended to the hopeless romantic, or someone coming off a breakup. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan have never been better.",Null,1,3,8 October 2000
The Green Mile," Excellent!
","Bravo! Stephen King's novel has been turned into an outstanding film. Set in the deep South in 1935, a death row prison guard meets an inmate who will truly change his life. Tom Hanks and the rest of the cast turn in excellent performances, but the real star of the film is Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey. I'll be shocked if he doesn't take home the Oscar!This is a truly gripping and absorbing film, and it is very dark and disturbing. It's great. Don't miss it!",Null,0,0,4 March 2000
The Lion King," Funny!
","This is a really funny movie, with some great characters with great voices (especially Scar, Zazu and the hyenas). The scene where Scar kills Mufasa is eerie, and the music in that scene is creepy and bone chilling. Yes, the story does have its weak links, most of the songs are fun but forgettable (although the African instrumental songs in the background really add to the atmosphere), and could have been a bit shorter.The character of the long-suffering Zazu is hysterical. However, someone else does the voice of Zazu in the sequel and that ruined the character for me. Great job, Rowan Atkinson!",Null,0,0,27 February 2000
Shrek," Hysterical with a message
","Much like Shallow Hal and Bridget Jones' Diary, Shrek deals with learning to love people just the way they are. Unlike the previous two flicks, Shrek is a beautifully animated fairy tale with an edge. The voice overs are priceless (especially Eddie Murphy as the loudmouthed Donkey and John Lithgow as the egotistical Lord Farquaad), and sharp, witty dialogue (I could've done without the 'toilet humor', though) and hilarious pop culture spoofs abound. I almost split a gut when Shrek started crooning Billy Joel's 'Just The Way You Are', and the fairy tale/Disney characters (especially the Gingerbread Man) are all clever and inspired. Well done, Dreamworks!",Null,0,0,11 March 2002
Vanilla Sky," Different is not always good (minor spoilers)
","I watched Vanilla Sky with an open mind but not by choice (my sister talked me into seeing it). Cameron Diaz's character was not fleshed out fully enough to really feel for her, while Penelope Cruz comes off somewhat better, but still comes off as little more than a pretty face to entice male viewers. Cruise just comes off as unlikeable before and after his character's transformations, though his fears are comprehensible, and the ending was a cop-out. It would have been more plausible (and more interesting) if he had killed his lover in a rage thinking she was the girl who had ruined his face (and life), and how he would deal with it. The last 15 minutes made me wonder why I'd wasted my time following this story at all. The theme song by Paul McCartney is nice, though, and the visuals of NYC (especially in the opening) are stunning. Not a movie for everyone.",Null,0,0,11 March 2002
Mr. Holland's Opus," Brings back fond memories
","I love this movie because I had a fantastic, inspirational teacher in high school that all the students admired and looked up to. Even though I was in high school when this movie came out, I still carry the memories. Nicolas Cage deserved to win his Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas, but I still would have loved to see Richard Dreyfuss win. The whole cast was wonderful, and you actually felt like you were in the 60s and 70s, unlike other films set in that time period. How often does a film come out that generations relate to; and a film so touching about a teacher who cares about his students, and vice versa? Will always be one of my favorite films.",Null,27,34,12 August 1999
Speed," A fun ride
","Normally I hate action flicks, but this one was a lot of fun. Sandra Bullock's first major film role finds her behind the wheel of a bus rigged to explode if it goes below 50 MPH. A pretty implausable plot twist, but it works. Keanu Reeves and Dennis Hopper are very believable as the enemies, and their fight atop the speeding train was VERY cool. A lot of fun, but skip the AWFUL sequel.",Null,0,0,10 April 2001
The Sixth Sense," The best movie of 1999!!!
","I saw 'The Sixth Sense' and I was totally blown away. Every performance was wonderful (with Haley Joel Osment stealing the entire show out from under Bruce Willis), the plot, dialogue and action were crisp and exciting, and was an all around great film, and should very well be an Oscar contender. The ending was the best and most unpredictable movie ending I've ever seen. I hope this film wins a million awards.",Null,0,0,30 August 1999
The Replacements," Surprisingly good
","This is no Oscar contender...but who cares? It's a movie to enjoy and laugh with, and have fun. It's like the Major League of football. A lot of the players were very funny, including the sumo wrestler, the wimpy loudmouth Orlando Jones plays, the two huge black brothers, and most especially the crazed lineman who goes into bull mode whenever he sees red! They are balanced out by the more subdued but still entertaining performances by Keanu Reeves, Gene Hackman, Brooke Langton and the guys who played the deaf player and the Christian player. Most of the material is predictable but the cast is great and they provide plenty of humorous moments.",Null,1,2,18 August 2000
Apollo 13," Awesome
","What a powerful film! I only wish I'd seen it on the big screen and not on video. The story is full of suspense and exitement, and I got so caught up in it, I forgot that these were actors and not the real Apollo 13! All of the acting (especially by the three leads and Kathleen Quinlan) is first rate. This is definitely one of Tom Hanks' finest performances, if not the finest. Kudos to Ron Howard and the special effects team. What a terrific film.",Null,0,0,27 February 2000
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Creepy but entertaining
","I will always remember Interview with the Vampire because it was the first R rated movie I ever saw in the theater. I was 15 and wanted my first R rated movie to be an experience to remember.And what an experience! The sets and costumes are great, as are the actors. Tom Cruise over-acts with a passion, but it fits the character of Lestat. Brad Pitt brings a gentle humanity to his character of Louis, who is Lestat's polar opposite. Don't miss the last scene. You'll laugh your head off!",Null,0,1,16 April 2000
The Wedding Singer," A total guilty pleasure
","Wow...an Adam Sandler movie I actually enjoyed! Maybe it stems from my love of the '80s (if you think that's scary, you should see my CD collection). Tons of period humor (the Boy George guy with a fetish for 'Do You Really Want To Hurt Me' never fails to make me laugh), great if cheesy '80s songs and a sweet, tender and well-told love story. As someone who is not a huge fan of either Sandler or Drew Barrymore, this is a fun movie for a rainy day or just for a few mindless laughs.",Null,1,1,11 March 2002
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Am I missing something?
","I didn't hate this movie, but I didn't laugh much either. I was mostly confused. I guess most of the humor was lost on me. I did get a kick out of the 'horny toad' thing, though. All the actors did a good job. The film did run about half an hour too long, though. What else can I say?",Null,0,0,10 April 2001
