The Avengers," Earth's Mightiest Nerds Heave a Sigh of Collective Relief
","Comic book nerds, like other nerds, worry a lot about film adaptations of the works they cherish. This is for good reason, since the majority of Comic Book Movies (CBM's) created so far are still bad to awful. But ever since Brian Singer's X-Men in 2000, they've been mostly getting better. X-Men was revolutionary because it was very good, camp was minimized, and it was the first watchable film to feature a super team. 'Avengers' is revolutionary for the 1st two reasons, and because it weaves together 3 previously existing movie franchises plus supporting characters into a unified, cohesive whole. Imagine if someone tried to blend The Terminator with James Bond. A lot of us nerds were worried that this movie would be a big, crowded, confusing, silly bit of idiotic posing and exploding emptiness. But fortunately, it is not so. The script is true to the respective characters and is great fun. Especially to anybody who grew up reading Marvel comics. We called ourselves Marvelites back in the day, and when we were 12-years-old reading Marvel comics, we felt that the Marvel Universe was somehow real in a sense we couldn't articulate, and deep down we all wanted to be heroes living in a world of other heroes. This movie gets you as close to that as you can, at least within a theater. We comic nerds like our heroes, and we want our heroes to have interesting and distinct personalities. We like them to have weaknesses and emotions, but we like them to suck it up and be heroes when the chips are down. And at the same time, we don't want them to cross the line into corn or camp. Well, I guess you can't avoid a little corn, but thankfully there is no camp. This isn't Citizen Kane, mind you, but then, Citizen Kane didn't have the Hulk. So there you go. Based on what my non-nerd friends say, this film is good fun for non-nerds too.",10,3,7,11 May 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Narcissistic Powerlessness
","The vampire boy looks like a male prostitute and the werewolf boy looks like a victim of fetal alcohol syndrome. Yet these are the least shocking fantasies dwelling in the hearts of adolescent girls and women over 40.This is the second Twilight movie I have seen, and as far as I can tell, the heroine, Bella, has made no attempt to find an academic, artistic or athletic passion, nor has she attempted any other type of pursuit of achievement or learning. She appears to be somewhat petulant and extremely selfish, playing the vampire boy and the werewolf boy off against each other, and the two romantic rivals are too damn stupid to realize this.The vampires in these films are all frozen at approximately age 17 in physical appearance and emotional development. As far as I can tell, only one vampire has a job, yet somehow they have buttloads of money for trophy homes and private islands and private jets.At age 17, Bella is willing to become permanently stunted herself at her own narcissistic stage of development, becoming a vampire for all eternity on the basis of the mystique and male prostitute sexiness of the vampire boy.It's the height of romanticism in our culture to fantasize about 17 year girls who don't know any better irrevocably tying their fates to creepy immature older guys.Vampires and werewolves fight huge battles to protect Bella from either bad vampires or bad werewolves. Bella takes no action to help defend herself...she is an object to be revered and protected.Of course, this all culminates in Bella getting pregnant, because if the ideal of femininity is the elimination personal achievement and expression, than the crowning achievement of womanhood is to make babies...even if the baby is a bloodsucking demon spawn.The traditional adolescant protagonist in films and movies undergoes a conflict or has an adventure and along the way gains wisdom and maturity that will help the character make their way in the adult world...'Juno' and 'Rushmore' typify this concept. None of that in Twilight, that's for sure. Bella will remain twisted and stunted, just as the American imagination has been twisted and stunted by economic deterioration and religious authoritarianism. Besides being a major mind-rape for adolescents with any emotional vulnerabilities, parents should note that this film has a very graphic (and extremely bloody) c-section birth scene for Bella's Hellspawn bloodsucking demon vampire baby.",1,9,11,10 December 2011
3:10 to Yuma," 3:10 to Nowhere.
","There is a lot of good photography and some exciting set pieces, and there are bits of good acting in this movie, and even a few scenes that work pretty well. But the high points are overwhelmed by numerous plot points wherein characters do inexplicably stupid things or things contrary to the nature of the character. This happens mostly with the good guys, but also a couple times with bad guy Russell Crowe. My wife and I paused the movie halfway through because it got late and I was tired and the next day she had to convince me that we should finish it so at least we knew what happened. But my wife also felt that the movie was, as a whole, unbelievable due to these many plot holes and inconsistencies. It seems to me that a supposedly exciting movie should hook you in better than that.I also have to say that this is the 2nd movie I have ever seen with the adult Christian Bale (back in the 80's I saw 'Empire of the Sun') and I have yet to be impressed. Of course the other film was 'Batman Begins' which stinks in too many ways to count. But anyway, so far, it is my opinion that the adult Christian Bale seems to be a 1.5 note player. He's good at doing that vacant, angst-ridden stare that is so popular these days, the expression into which bad directors hope the audience will project their own emotions so as to save the artists some work. But not much more.Another thing: some critic said this is the best western since 'Unforgiven.' Please! Not that 'Unforgiven' was all that great, heck, 'High Plains Drifter' and 'Outlaw Josie Wales' are tons better. But truly, the best western since 'Unforgiven' was 'Brokeback Mountain.' And for crimony sakes, 'Brokeback Mountain' was better than 'Unforgiven.' I will concede, however, that watching '3:10 to Yuma' is better than watching no western at all. But is it better than just watching a rerun of 'Gunsmoke' or 'Kung Fu'? I don't think so.",4,2,5,6 February 2008
Iron Man 2," Weapons, Money, Politics.
","This is a fine comic book movie that relies as much on snappy dialogue and characters as it does fight scenes and CGI. IMO, this is a good idea in that with regard to FX and CGI, we have reached the age of overkill.Another interesting departure from modern superhero films: typically such films increase the number of supervillians with each sequel, i.e., Spidey 3 and Batman Forever having 3 supervillians. But no, Favreau wisely chooses to have 1 supervillian here.Finally, Iron Man diverges from current trends in that he heavily relies, even depends, on his supporting cast. Rhodie, Pepper, and Happy all contribute heavily to Our Hero's eventual triumph. I find this refreshing when I contrast it with the monomania of certain popular heroes. Also, unlike Christopher Nolan's Batman movies, there is no attempt to make Iron Man 2 more overpowering, bombastic, mindnumbing and pretentious than Iron Man 1. No, the attempt is simply to make a movie that is true to the characters and scenario of Iron Man 1, and to make the movie fun, interesting, and exciting. In this way perhaps the Iron Man franchise will be like the James Bond franchise, making each film simply another chapter in the life of our hero, rather than trying to make each film a quantum leap in intensity over the previous.And even though Iron Man 2 does not smack you upside the head every 3 minutes trying to tell you how 'deep' and 'meaningful' it is, there is a genuine socio-political subtext to this film that is plain to see if anyone cares to look. The final message is ambiguous and open-ended, but if one follows the threads regarding the interaction between weapons, money and politics, Iron Man 2 is understatedly subversive.",8,3,6,25 May 2010
Spider-Man 3," Three's a Crowd
","I love comic books and there are many comic book movies I have liked, including the first 2 Spidey films. But 'Spider-Man 3' is pretty terrible. I think the major problems with this film come from 3 big mistakes: 1) Trying to outdo the first 2 Spidey films. I.e., Spidey #1 had 1 super-villain, #2 had 2 super-villains, therefore #3 should have 3 villains. This doesn't work because these villains are clearly too much for Spidey, thus necessitating some extremely unbelievable and stupid plot twists. And it doesn't work because there isn't enough time to develop any emotional interest in the hero-villain conflict.2) It's obvious that this movie was created to produce maximum video/computer game spinoffs. The menu screen of the DVD features video game versions of Spidey and other characters moving about in video game style and a couple of the 'special features' are video game promos. The creative decision to go this way has led to fight scenes that are way too long, break too many laws of physics too often, shatter all sense of believability, and feel downfight oppressive and exhausting. My guess is that for those of us over 35, at least those of us who don't play computer games daily, our eyes are simply not geared fast enough to really follow this kind of action.3) Over-reliance on Computer Generated Images (CGI). The fight scenes all look like either cartoons or video games, and so you just don't have the kind of dramatic involvement required to suspend disbelief. In the old days, directors had to rely on tricks of editing, camera position, stuntmen, harnesses, etc. to create exciting and believable fight scenes. Now that those gimmicks aren't necessary, directors seem to think we'll just buy into anything. Not so: the old school fight scenes, where you had stunt men doing what was vaguely possible intercut with close ups of the actors' faces, looking angry, exasperated, sweaty, etc., had much more dramatic impact. Sean Connery, Errol Flynn, Johnny Weismuller, Steve McQueen and Clint Eastwood never needed CGI. Hollywood seems to think that CGI solves all problems of special effects and fight scenes. Not so: CGI looks fake, just in a new way.Overall, Spider-Man 3 is bad because it follows the conventions and formulae of most modern action films: more, harder, bigger, badder, etc. and full-speed ahead with the games and merchandising. This movie is all about the paycheck, there is neither heart nor soul.",1,1,4,28 May 2008
Once," Return of 'The Blair Witch Project'
","At Gitmo, one of the things the interrogators do to 'break' prisoners is to subject them to prolonged exposure to songs from TV's Sesame Street. It turns out that even when it's designed to be benign or even therapeutic, being forced to listen to certain music truly is torture. Also at Gitmo, if a 'detainee' tries to end his suffering by means of starvation, the U.S. military will force feed him so as to prevent this. By the time I had sat through 'Once,' it seemed like I could vividly imagine just what those experiences must be like. 'Once' is a force-feeding of folk music.The musical performances in 'Once' are characterized by an affected earnestness and a self-styled soulfulness. They are self-conscious without being self-aware: in other words, a pre-ironic mindset. Watching them made me uncomfortable in the way that one is uncomfortable when a naïve, sensitive, and bad poet insists upon reading you his work and asking for feedback. This film is photographed with a blurry, hand held camera, and to say that the script is minimalist is an understatement. It is possible to momentarily forget that this film is fiction, that someone scripted this. In my opinion, this is a deliberate cheat, a gimmick to conceal the thinness, corniness, and improbability of the plot. This is 'The Blair Witch Project,' but with music.There is a sense of arrested development with Glen Hansard's character, a self-pitying 36-year-old still living at his father's house. It's creepy to know that when this movie was made, Marketa Irglova was just 17. The pair are reported to 'dating' nowadays, and it is reasonable to suspect that the relationship was probably not 'platonic' when they were composing and performing together prior to filming. In short, this film feels like the fantasy of a college sophomore, neglecting his classes in hopes that music will be his ticket out. If you have ever wondered what it would be like to have a street musician move in with you, I strongly recommend this movie. It makes 85 minutes seem like a month.",1,6,26,27 December 2007
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain's Commentary
","A lot of people expect Capt. America stories to be jingoistic right wing combat porn, but in the mid-1970's, writer Steve Englehart did a kind of parallel Marvel Universe Watergate-saga called 'The Secret Empire,' which showed corruption reaching the pinnacle of US politics, and Capt. America was confronted with reality. And in the early 2000's, writer Ed Brubaker again brought contemporary politics and war into the Capt. America storyline with the original version of the Winter Soldier. Brubaker's run writing Cap was the best ever for Our Hero. This film is a brilliant synthesis of the best political CA story lines and the 1970's conspiracy movie thrillers, such as 'Day of the Condor' and 'All the President's Men,' and the presence of Robt. Redford here is a clear signal of what the directors intend. It's also clear to anyone with the slightest bit of imagination that the main plot is a hard-hitting critique of the US's policy of assassination-by-drone...Cap's pal Nick Fury intends to pre-emptively rub out 20 million 'bad guys' in order to (supposedly) protect 7 billion. Chris Evans nails the difficult part of being an earnest and noble man in the modern world, and there is copious high quality super-heroic stage business, as Cap (and his pals Black Widow and the Falcon) smash their way through the requisite armies of henchmen and super-villains. The directors and fight choreographers also nailed the difficult task of translating Kirby-esque shield-slinging fight scenes into cinematic reality...this film, like the 2013 Thor movie, was like a living silver-age Marvel comic. So we have been given a pulse-pounding conspiracy thriller and socio- political critique, delivered in the mighty Marvel manner. This is the best (so far) of the comic-book movies. But will it spur a discussion? Will it awaken America to the sense of outrage we so adeptly suppress...the grim reality that we inhabit the Drone nation...sending our aerial buzz-bombs into the world, killing thousands of innocents? Will this film knock our blinders off, bring the realization that our mealy-mouthed pseudo-liberal and belligerent right-wing politicians are bringing unprecedented death and destruction to the world? Only time will tell.But it's telling that in a time of political corruption of a scale and nature which makes the Nixon Administration look like a church picnic, the only main-stream film with the guts to speak up is a comic book movie.",10,1,3,6 May 2014
Man of Steel," Snapping Necks and Cashing Checks
","I went in having low expectations for this film due to my low opinion of Hack, I mean Zack, Snyder, and due to Warner Communications' dismal record of Superman film adaptations. Therefore, when I finally saw MOS at the second run theater, I was pleasantly surprised to find that in many ways this was a decent movie. The actors playing Supes and Lois are good, the shots of Superman flying are good, a lot of the Krypton backstory is good, and Ma and Pa Kent were also good. I am giving a lot of credit here for the wise casting decisions, since 2006's 'Superman Returns' had the worst Superman and Lois in movie history. Also, the main storyline about Gen. Zod and his cronies wanting to terraform Earth into a New Krypton was a pretty interesting story idea. But the movie is marred by a slow, meandering beginning, and by the excessively cluttered and complex fight sequences which characterize this stage of the digital revolution. Worse, this film simply does not give us enough of Superman/Kal/Clark...the eponymous character is mostly a cipher. We care about him because we learned to like and trust him in previous incarnations, but more than that, we don't know. Then there is the aspect of Superman killing one of his enemies. For the classic years of the Superman comics, Superman had a self-imposed moral code that prohibited killing, period. This was to balance out the fact that by virtue of his invulnerability, Superman never had to live with the possibility of his own death, the way a human must always live with the possibility that he could on any given day be taken out by a stray bullet, an auto accident, or a medical emergency. Now, in this film, no such moral code is established, nor is it talked about after the villain is killed by Our Hero. By these omissions, an event of great drama and interest is reduced to mere collateral damage.If we had earlier seen young Clark and one of his 2 fathers discuss the morality of killing, or if afterwords, Our Hero had become disgusted with himself and vowed never to kill again, that would have been good, dramatic stuff. But no, Superman snuffs out a villain and then utters one obligatory cry of regret, but otherwise he is as detached as a US president snuffing out children in Yemen with his mighty drone bombs. Another weird thing is that this film spends a lot of time on the streets of Metropolis, as buildings are getting blown up and all heck breaking loose, showing people experiencing the carnage up close. There is miles and miles of this footage...way more than necessary to tell the story.The way these sequences unfold, you find yourself thinking '9/11.' And for me, I complete the thought this way: '9/11...AGAIN...every year for 12 years and for the next hundred years action movies are going to keep evoking 9/11 for manipulative and jingoistic motives...phooey!!!' And then I remember the shameful ad campaign earlier this year, with Superman's image being used to entice young people to join the National Guard, to throw their lives away as cannon fodder in the USA's imperial wars of aggression. So, yes, this Superman is indeed and improvement on the last one. All the same, I'd prefer a more a human version, a Superman less tainted by crimes and excesses our own insanely militaristic and aggressive era. We needed a Man of Steel, instead we have a Man of Depleted Uranium.",6,3,6,14 August 2013
Dreamgirls," Fake Motown Sound Really Hurts.
","There are some good performances here, notably Eddie Murphy and Jennifer Hudson, but unfortunately the music sounds like the kind of fake Motown that might have been played on an episode of 'Laverne and Shirley.' The dancing and costumes were good, but they made me wish that I was hearing The Temptations or the real Diana Ross and the Supremes. With all the money and talent at their disposal, I don't know why they settled for music with such a cheesy, fake sound to it. In 'Ray,' and 'Walk the Line,' you have musically based movies that have people impersonating iconic singers and the folks who made those movies strove to get the sound right. Also, 'Dreamgirls' was overlong.",2,1,4,5 February 2007
Batman Begins," Bring on the rubber nipples.
","I am a die-hard and long-time Batman fan, and waited all my life for someone to make a 'serious' Batman film. Now that someone has done this, I realize I was better off without one. At least, I was better off without this serious Batman film. 'Serious' is the essence of the problem. The film goes overboard and worse yet, overlong trying to show just how Bruce Wayne got koo-koo enough to dress as bat, trying to convince us that one man could master all known martial arts and detective skills, and trying to convince us that someone could really fight in a bulletproof batsuit , and trying to convince us that a batmobile could really exist. There is no subtlety, and nothing is left to the imagination. But this flaw alone would not be fatal. What kills this movie are, in my mind, 5 unpardonable sins: 1) Katie Holms is horribly miscast as a 'hardnosed' deputy DA and love interest for Bruce Wayne. She is the very definition of unconvincing in this role. She comes off more as a barista. Compared to Katie Holms, Kim Basinger is Meryl Steep and Lee Merriwether is Vivian Liegh. And there is absolutely zero chemistry with Christian Bale. 2) Speaking of Christian Bale: I've seen this guy in other stuff and I had high hopes. But, while generally competent, I did not find his Batman/Bruce Wayne as nearly compelling as Adam West or even Michael Keaton. Perhaps his acting is too good: perhaps he does not leave enough for the imagination? West and Keaton both seemed to convey a sense of keeping their cards close to the vest. Also, why in heaven's name did Nolan let Christian Bale imitate Michael Keaton's rasp when in the Batman drag? Silly, silly, silly. 3) Spoiler Alert: It is the height of heresy for Batman to voluntarily reveal his secret identity, even to women he is hot for. Even when he is trying to sleep with the woman. Within the context of this movie, it is inconceivable that Bruce Wayne would spend 18 years of single-minded obsession turning himself into the fearsome Batman, only to risk it all just to impress Katie Holms. She is with the fricken DA's office! The real Batman would know he could never trust a civil service employee or political appointee with the secret of his true identity! 4) The final, cataclysmic battle, rather than being satisfying or cathartic, is yet another silly, over-exaggerated CGI mess. Just because you can use CGI does not mean you should. Batman should never emulate Spiderman or Arnold Schwartzenegger. The climactic sequence, like virtually all modern action movies, is more a Roadrunner/Coyote cartoon than a fight scene. The idea of a grown man dressing like a bat requires enough suspension of belief: the CGI stuff overloads it. Adam West and Michael Keaton didn't need CGI. 5) Rubber muscles: I guess Time/Warner did some focus group research and figured out that there are a hell of a lot of rubber-clothing fetishists who want to buy movie tickets. The rubber muscles were the worst part of the Tim Burton movies, and reached unprecedent heights of auto-eroticism in the duly-reviled Joel Schumacher movies. I can't wait for the sequel of 'Batman Begins' to see how rubber nipples look in the 21st Century!!!Christopher Nolan had all the money in the world to make this movie, and had plenty of time and creative control as well. These are the reasons for my fierce criticism and low rating of this film. Although they have inferior special effects, judged as cinema and as pieces of heroic adventure, both the 1966 'Batman, the Movie' and the 1989 'Batman' are far superior to this film. In the earlier films, the ridiculousness is intentional and drives home a point, whereas 'Batman Begins' is often unintentionally ridiculous.",1,2,8,14 January 2008
The Dark Knight," Eight Years in Gotham City
","This movie moves faster and is far more entertaining than its predecessor, Batman Begins. But that doesn't say much. Batman Begins was thunderously dull, pretentious and oppressive: its central conceit, that the character of Batman can be made plausible if one spends hours and hours exploring every iota of emotional trauma and angst, and hours and hours more explaining where Batman gets his batsuit, batmobile and other gear, was ludicrous from the start.Conversely, the Dark Knight is not bogged down by any attempt to relate the characters and events to any known reality. Moon-size plot holes, too numerous to count, and cardboard characters populate this film.Batman is portrayed as a boy billionaire, scion of the super-rich, affecting a bored and callous exterior that allegedly conceals profound depths of emotion. He is dependent upon the aid and counsel of 2 old men, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, who run his home and personal life, his finances, and provide him with all the wondrous bat-gizmos.Batman is relentless, and while he allegedly is troubled by the fact that his pursuit of criminals is resulting in collateral damage amounting to the destruction of half the city, he does not let it stop him. He eventually becomes reviled by the citizens he is sworn to protect, but ultimately he keeps his 'resolve.' The Joker is referred to, multiple times, as a 'terrorist.' The Joker himself says he is a 'wild dog,' not motivated by greed or power, merely the joy of destruction. He cannot be rehabilitated, nor can he be appeased by the liberation of a people, nor can he be bought off.Ultimately Batman's pursuit of the Joker results in Batman literally tapping into every cell phone in Gotham City, and in the destruction of much of the supporting cast and a hospital full of patients. And Batman tortures people now. But of course Batman is ultimately successful, and this completes this bizarre fascist bedtime story.Writing this now, having had a shallow boy millionaire and 2 old men 'protecting' me for the past 8 years, having them tapping my phone and email, and having them blowing up 2 nations and killing a couple million people in the process, I was not pleased by the results. So pardon me, Chris Nolan, if I happen to think you are unimaginative and cowardly for using your bully pulpit to write a $200 million love letter to our now thankfully gone 'Leader.' A lot of creative people use their position to challenge the status quo, or to promote peace and tolerance, but apparently violence and sadism are more your cup of tea. Me, I've just finished 8 years in Gotham City and it was 8 years too many.",1,4,15,21 January 2009
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," The Ugliness of Beautiful People
","The only reason I didn't walk out of this movie was that I saw it on a plane. A truly terrible film, there is no on screen chemistry between these actors no matter how often they did the nasty between takes. Not only is there no chemistry, in the entire running time they fail to give any reason why any person would like either star.This movie isn't funny, so it can't be a comedy. Yet it is not in any plausible or possible, so it can't be a thriller or drama, either.No, this is the sort of filmaking at which Hollywood succeeds, big budget, bankable stars, and sex/violence aimed at 14 year old boys, and containing not a wit of originality or interest. The kind of movie that has a decent opening weekend, and due to the star power and violence sells well overseas and in home-video markets.Yet it remains a big, stinking turd, despite the gloss.",1,3,7,7 June 2010
Hancock," Don't Even Watch This On a Bet
","Some bad movies are fun to watch, such as Ed Wood's quixotically demented works, while other bad movies are vile, odious things, being not only crimes against art, but are also crimes against the human spirit. 'Hancock' is a crime against art, the human spirit, intelligence, and decency, to name just a few. There is no amusement whatsoever to be gained for anyone from watching this film. The tragedy is compounded in that 2 A-list stars and a cult-comedy icon somehow were compelled to do this film.This is a loud, boring and insipid film that does not know whether it intends to be a comedy, action movie, or action comedy. This is not to say that it is actually funny in any places; it is not, but one can discern that comedy was intended in various places. The script, if it can be called such, plays out as though an 8-year old recycled the worst works of dead scifi writer L. Ron Hubbard after being overdosed on Children's Tylenol. There is no plausibility, and no internal consistency in this fictional world, and there are creepy, gross ideas, suggestive of incest.Perhaps the most odious and disgusting thing about 'Hancock' is its overt racism. Here we have an impossibly strong, invulnerable, flying black man, the most powerful man in the world, who wastes his time drinking on the street and behaving like an idiot, until a white liberal takes an interest in him, shows him how to act polite and dress nice. Guess what: the white liberal's 1st step in showing Our Hero the path or righteousness is to send Our Hero to do a stretch in jail. And better yet: this black superhero happens to loose his powers (temporarily) if he kisses a certain white woman.Here is an example of the kind of gross, cheap, juvenile, racist trash being peddled: Our Hero, being miffed at a couple of the other inmates in the jail, literally shoves one man's head up another man's butt. Yes, this actually happens in the movie, the audience is treated to the sight of one man's head clear up another man's butt. All the while, the theme music from 'Sanford and Son' plays, just to make it perfectly clear that we should be laughing at this funny stuff being done by this whacky black person.Some people might be tempted to see this film because there are few other films about black superheroes, but every other film about black superheroes is much, much better. The 'Blade' films, for instance. Better yet, see the new film with Morgan Freeman playing real-life black superhero Nelson Mandela, that one is very highly recommended.",1,0,3,21 January 2010
The Blind Side," Diff'rent Strokes, Part Deux
","It takes a lot of courage for filmmakers to show the daily struggles of rich, white, good-looking Republicans in the South. And it takes a lot of courage for rich, white, good-looking Southern Republicans to imagine that a large, young African American man might just have the potential to be a football star. And it takes the most courage of all to show a story where issues of race and class in the USA are key issues, and yet totally ignore the economic and political constructs which continue to disenfranchise certain races and economic classes.Thank goodness for the can-do attitude of a Southern MILF! Thank goodness for a mansion and million$ made from fast-food restaurants...thank goodness for the poor and ethnic minorities who eat huge amounts of fast food and provide cheap labor for fast food restaurants! Obviously, the solution to class and racial inequality in America is MMMMM: More MILF's, mansions, millionaires and McDonalds!",Null,1,4,27 July 2011
