Resident Evil: Afterlife," F the stupid critics. Its 3D action worth a lot more than what you pay for.
","I wouldn't given this movie a 10 by myself but since some people harshly give this a 1 or a 2, I'm giving it 10 to balance out.Bottom line is that this movie doesn't deserve a 1 or 2-star rating from some air heads. Yes, the story didn't make much sense but it's plausible and it's probably the best Paul can make out of his previous films (unless he wants to head in a new direction with no Alice which wouldn't be so Resident Evil anymore). Watch it for its 3D action without paying much attention to the story itself. Maybe you need to be a 'guy' who plays RE games to enjoy this movie Lol. If you haven't watched the previous films, there's no point in seeing this one.The best part of the movie was its score. Tomandandy did such a great job. It was very very Resident Evil. From the start of the intro score, I was hooked. I bought the soundtrack as soon as I got home. 'Tokyo', 'Los Angeles', and 'Flying' are my favorite tracks.Original Resident Evil is still the best. Afterlife is a lot better than Apocalypse and Extinction though. I agree there isn't so much to the story itself or anybody who isn't familiar with the series will enjoy this movie. But it shouldn't be all the reasons to give this movie a 1 star rating. That is just wrong. By the way, it is implied that this movie is a sequel to its previous films. $%@# those people who gave it a 1 because they don't get the story.There are movies I enjoy watching for story and there are movies I watch for pure 'cool' action. This movie is meant for action and 3D graphics and, man, you get the best of em! Milla was so worn out in Extinction. I can't believe how she managed to get her hotness back in this movie. Shawn Robert was probably my favorite character although he has too unusual 'evil' powers. I didn't see the point of the dogs splitting up but it was cool! The dude with the big hammer was cool but unusually big to be a usual zombie. I'm pretty sure there isn't a person that big. like 15 feet? what the hell? He didn't seem to be that big in RE5 game though.",10,22,42,28 September 2010
