Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," all things shining indeed
","This movie was not good. It was damn good - awesome in a way too few of the blockbuster product are. Every decade must have its epics - the moral (Dances with Wolves, Schindler's List), the political (Nixon, JFK), those esoteric and rich beyond reduction (Heat, Kundun, The Thin Red Line). Now the 90s has an epic that truly is suitable for all ages and is the crowning achievement of the decade in science fiction and adventure. This movie is not about professional film criticism mind you- established circles have thrown out dampeners on this gem as predicted. But for everyone, this film is personal -either you believe Lucas has done it again or you don't. I love this film - an epic vision of wonder it would take an eternity to lose.",10,0,0,4 June 1999
