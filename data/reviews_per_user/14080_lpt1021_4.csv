Angels & Demons," Very Good Adaptation
","I had my doubts about seeing this film because of several bad reviews I had read. But I have to say that after seeing it, I dare say that it was a good adaptation from the book.I read the book twice, last time, was a few weeks ago. And I found several of the plots a little bit corny and boring. However, the main plot and the characters were very good as well as all the twists.The film starts a little bit slow, but it doesn't matter because they explain very well the conclave and what has happened in the Vatican.I am very happy and pleased that they left the reporters out of the movie, since I thought they got a little bit unrealistic at some point.I liked the portrayal of Vittoria Vetra, very much in character in the movie, more serious and more professional and she was even dressed in the proper clothes. I even found Ayelet Zurer to have more chemistry with Tom Hanks than Audrey Tatou in The Da Vinci Code a few years ago.The only thing I didn't agree was that they didn't address the true relationship from the Pope and the camerlengo. It would've been a great dramatic ending.",9,4,7,24 May 2009
Revolutionary Road," Two of the best actors of their generation
","What an amazing film. First, I have to day that Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are probably the best actors of their generation. Their performances are deep, emotional and outstanding as they're able to portray this troubled couple and make you feel sorry for them. The way the different emotions cross their faces in a matter of seconds is truly award-winning. What takes you to that level of anger and boredom? What makes you think that moving from the place that is making your life miserable is going to change it? I don't know, but this is what Frank and April thought. They thought that by leaving to another country their problems and worries would fade away, but the truth is, they would just follow them. They never dare face the truth. As much as dysfunctional they were, there were other ways, easy and harmless, to deal with this situation. What started out well turned into a fantasy and a routine that drove each other crazy. And it seemed that April had an idea to make things right again, and it even touched Frank's heart, but their stubbornness and the great idea of leaving only made things worse. The sad thing about it is that someone whose mind what as troubled as their marriage was, was more intelligent to see the real thing. Once they were confronted, things got out of control. I don't know what drives a marriage to end up hurting each other the way they did. How they never thought of any word before saying it. I think that April married Frank as an escape of her failed career. Too bad it was too late for forgiveness. I haven't read the book, but the movie was fantastic. The score might be a little repetitive but it fits the story perfectly and you just can't forget the great supporting cast.",9,4,8,29 December 2008
Into the Wild," Very touching and sad story
","What a wonderful film. And what a sad story. I understand Christopher's eagerness to experience a different kind of lifestyle and somehow try to get away of all the problems he had back at home. But that would've been good if it had been for a while, in order to find himself. What I found amazing is all the different people he met along his journey and how he touched and left a part of him in each one of them. However, the only thing that bothers me is that he was a little selfish, because, as much as he wanted to reach his destination and make his dream come true, all the people that were left behind suffered from his absence and thinking what was it like for him being out there, with nothing but will, courage and a dream. It's sad how a situation like this makes a person react. Christopher's parents knew they had done something wrong and it was to late to make it right. Emile Hirsch's performance is extraordinary. The rest of the cast is very good. I was very surprised to see a grown-up Kristen Stewart, performing a song with a very nice voice. Sean Penn did it again, now from the director's chair. The landscapes are breathtaking, shown with a very pleasant soundtrack.",8,0,1,27 December 2008
The Wrestler," Wonderful film with a sad story
","I never expected this film to be what it is. It exceeded my expectations. Mickey Rourke gives a powerful and admirable performance as this man who, after being a big star, is now defeated and is trying to survive. I felt sorry for this character. Sorry for a man who doesn't know his way in life, who doesn't know what he wants but who seems to be a man with a soul and a desire to share his feelings with someone who really cares about him. The supporting cast was brilliant. Marisa Tomei's performance is subtle but strong, whose character is in pretty much the same conditions as the lead's. Evan Rachel Wood is excellent as the estranged daughter, who, to my opinion, was very hard on her father and didn't quite understand him. She just gave up on him. The last scene with Marisa Tomei is wonderful. Those words were very true. Another thing that I liked, was the nice touch of Rourke's character walking through the hallways and downstairs with the cheer of an audience in the background.",9,1,1,25 January 2009
