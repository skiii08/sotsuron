The Legend of Bagger Vance," A modern-day legend, a fable, an uplifting story. It works!
","I call it 'Field of Greens.' Just as 'Field of Dreams' asked us to embrace our imagination, to enter into the realm of the heart, and put aside our cynicism, so it is with 'Bagger Vance.' Most people either love or hate stories like this. I suppose you have  to be somewhat of a romantic to enter into the spirit of such a movie. It worked for me because I saw it as a triumph of joy and of the human spirit. The main character 'finds his swing,'  which is to say he finds himself, he opens himself up to the beautiful possibilities that life has to offer. In short, I found it to be positive, uplifting, and refreshing.",9,1,3,27 October 2003
