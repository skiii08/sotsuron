Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Perfect Way to End His Masterpiece
","Kill Bill Volume 1 blew me away. It had such an impact on me that I saw it twice within 12 hours when it first came out. I had to see it twice to believe it. The music, costumes, visuals, anime, and bloodletting were too much for me; I instantly fell in love. I didn't think that it was possible to fall in love with a movie, but Tarantino proved me wrong.
I very anxiously awaited the release of Volume 2. I had never been so excited about the release of a movie in all of my life. Then it happened, April 16th 2004; Kill Bill Volume 2 was opened to the public. Opening night I went to see it with such hope of a continuation of the first half, an adrenaline rush of hip music and intense action. Then the movie started. The first hour or so I sat in the theater waiting for a repeat of Volume 1. It never came, and I was o so disappointed. I left the theater in utter disbelief wondering how the film, or half film, of my lifetime (Volume 1) could possibly be concluded (Volume 2) in such a way as to disappoint me. It wasn't until the next morning, after a night of mental processing, that I realized Volume 2 was PERFECT. Volume 2 was everything that Volume 1 wasn't; an ideal compliment. I had to see it again. Upon second viewing, my post-movie-going euphoria rivaled that of Volume 1. (For those of you who disliked this film after seeing it one time, I strongly recommend a second run through)Tarantino knew exactly what he was doing with this project. He hooked audiences with the delicious sinful superficial pleasures of Volume 1, then smothered the same audiences in the rich textural storyline of Volume 2. Like a parent-child relationship, he knew what I needed, and gave it to me against my ignorant wishes. It was only upon the subsequent epiphany of maturity that I realized that he had my best interest in mind. God bless you Quentin!In Volume 1, the characters and the fates that they suffered affected me very little (this includes The Bride). The film left little room for emotional attachments, as viewers were filled with adrenaline and utter disbelief from the visual gluttony that they had just experienced. Tarantino knew this, purposely squeezing out every morsel of storyline and character development in order to please the audience's lusty desires. Yet in Volume 2, my empathy for every character was overflowing, as once again Tarantino had fulfilled his goal of over stimulation, only this time in the opposite direction.Tarantino took a great risk in creating this project and releasing it to the world. To make such a film work takes an ultimate amount of skill and passion. Luckily for us all Tarantino has both. Now that all is said and done and the entire world of Kill Bill has been revealed to us, there is nothing left to do but marvel in the brilliance of it all. We have to put it all away and move on with the memory of it in the back of our minds. But we will always remember that this is what cinema is all about. We will never forget Kill Bill.",10,0,1,26 April 2004
Requiem for a Dream," Do I Smell Propaganda???
","*Possible Spoilers* This film was so hyped up that I (stupidly) bought it without renting it first. I figured that any film about the horrors of addiction had to be worth buying, especially considering the amazing reviews that this 'movie' had received. Boy did I make a mistake. After sitting through the first hour of this 'movie', I couldnt wait for it to be over. Don't get me wrong, the film displayed a genuine moral message, that addictions, no matter what form, are destructive. Yet I found the overtone of the film to be far more hellish than the reality that we live in. For instance, the doctor who gave the speed to Sarah (the old woman) was totally indifferent to the fact that the pills he gave her were causing psychotic reactions and were highly addictive. And when Harry went to the hospital after his arm had become severely infected, the doctor didn't give a s**t that Harry was near death, he called the  police without treating him first. The doctor acted like he'd never seen dying smack addict before. It was entirely unbelievable and frustrating. The scene in which Marion was performing for all of those businessmen was absurd. She f*cked another woman in front of dozens of cheering perverted businessmen just for a fix. This scene contained just one of many generalizations that the movie established, such as: all businessmen are greedy testosterone driven rapists, all doctors are out to get your money, and don't give two s***s about you, and all drug addicts will either end up in prison, resort to prostitution, or spend the rest of their lives in a psych ward after failed shock therapy, which by the way is rarely ,if ever used any more. The movie offered no alternate endings or situations that suggest positive solutions to overcoming addictions. This movie screamed 'IF YOU DO DRUGS YOU WILL DIE!!!' at the viewer. Now I'm no drug advocate, but give me a break. The movie might as well have consisted of God coming down from the heavens and pitching all drug users into the fires of hell. Its propaganda either way.In summary, highly overrated, and way too far fetched to be taken seriously.4/10, just for trying.",Null,1,2,9 October 2003
Final Destination 2," Somewhat Enjoyable but Totally Ridiculous
","I eagerly awaited the arrival of this film on video so that I could see it for a low price( judging from the stupidity of the original, this installment could not be worth $8.75). Before the film came out on video I read through quite a few of the reviews written on this web site for Final Destination 2, and judging from the general consensus, one would be led to believe that this film is actually a worthwhile movie. When July 22nd came around, and the video stores were stocked full, I actually felt a sense of excitement while driving to get it. So I rented the DVD version, took it home, and 15 minutes into the film I could have SWORN that I was watching the original movie, except for the fact that the characters were dying on the freeway, and not in the sky. I mean give me a Goddamn break, absolutely no originality or variation from the original. The only, and I mean ONLY reason why I didnt go back to the store and demand my 4 dollars back was because of the interesting/gory yet highly unrealistic deaths that the characters are led to.Anyone who took this movie seriously, or that felt any emotion other than simultaneous amusement and disgust should be hung naked by their eyelids with a laughing audience throwing rotten fruit at their backsides. I vaguely remember one reviewer's comment that any of these things could happen to any of us at anytime. This individual should be banned from this website for the rest of their life!! How could anyone in their right mind think that this movie is credible!?! The idea that some invisible force kills people and that death has a plan for all of us is absolutely moronic...... but I do realize that it was simply made for our entertainment.
My overall recommendation: Rent it once, but try to convince somebody else to pay for it, i.e. a friend, parent, or significant other. Under no circumstances should anyone purchase this movie, and anyone who has the desire to watch this movie more than once had better have a good excuse, such as to simply watch the death sequences again, because if you watch this movie twice for enjoyment you will have to live the rest of your life knowing that your a complete idiot. I give it a .5 out of 10.",2,0,2,28 July 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Amazingly Stylish Film
","*****Possible Spoiler, but Probably Not*****Wow! What a sexy movie! I greatly enjoyed Kill Bill Volume 1 the first night that I saw it, and I enjoyed it even more upon second viewing. Quentin Tarantino has a real knack for making films of amazing precision and jazz, and this one is no exception.After reading some negative reviews on this film I can feel nothing but disgust for those that insult this movie. I have seen many movies in my day and I can honestly say that this one ranks among the top, possibly the best as far as the style, choreography, and musical score go. DAMN this movie had great music. The scene in Tokyo with Lucy Lui and the Japanese Yakuza was nothing short of amazing. All of O Ren's (Lui's) crew were very hip and sexy, especially Go Go, her top body guard in the school girl uniform. Lucy Lui's character, O Ren, was beautiful and brutal, its just too bad that she died in the film. I'm actually considering renting Charlie's Angels after seeing her performance in this film, and Im not the least bit interested in the Charlie's Angels franchise, but if her performance is anywhere near what it was in Kill Bill, it would be worth watching. The acting was very believable and enjoyable, which brings me to wonder what the critics of it are basing their standards on, apparently they had forgotten to take their Prozac that day. Lastly, the choreography of the fight scenes put The Matrix Reloaded to shame, in other words it was fantastic.The endless gushing, squirting, and gurgling of blood may offend some viewers (as it was likely one of the bloodiest films of all time), but the gore wasnt to be taken seriously, it was a semi parody of old Kung Fu movies. Other critics were angry over the slow pace of the film, and the fact that it is cut in half. They feel that the producers are trying to rip off the public by making them pay for two tickets to see the whole story. Well, as far as that argument goes, if you want to see a movie that is the length of two typical movies, paying twice only makes sense. Besides who the hell cares that you have to pay an extra $8.50, I would have paid double the price just to see each half. We arent Somalians (most of us anyway), were Americans (the vast majority) and we have disposable income, I dont care who the hell you are, or where the hell you work. So stop bitching like 6 year old girls who didnt get their favorite Barbie doll for Christmas and keep your idiotic opinions inside of your seratonin deficient brains!!! So if you work for 30 cents a month, as so many other U.S. citizens do, then DONT GO SEE PART 2 AND SAVE YOUR ANNUAL SALARY FOR A BIGMACK AND FRIES!!! Its that damn simple. (I feel better now).....Ok, where was I?? O yeah this movie was bloody, but it really had to be in order to be all that it could be.I could go on all day about how great this film was but I have better things to do. So go see it, love it, when its over drool over what you have just seen, go home, turn on the computer, type imdb.com into your web browser, click Kill Bill Volume 1, vote on it, give it a 10, write a comment about how wonderful it was, then go see it again!!!10/10",10,0,1,12 October 2003
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Touching Film *Possible Spoilers*
","I wasn't exactly sure of what to expect before seeing this movie so I simply dove in head first on a whim. I must say that this movie isn't for everyone, but to those of us who can appreciate the nuances and complexities of a serious relationship, it is an instant classic. For those of you with short attention spans, steer clear of this one as there are a seemingly endless stream of scenes involving Joel's (Jim Carrey) memories in the middle section of the film. Even I, a strong advocate of the film, began to grow weary with these scenes, and only after the film had resolved realized their vast importance to the whole of the film. I can't promise that every viewer will see this in the same way that I did.
Kate Winslet was absolutely fantastic as Clementine. I nearly fell in love with her while watching the movie, despite the fact that her character had serious issues. Her character craved love and all I wanted to do was give it to her (you can take that any way you want). Jim Carrey was great for the part, yet interestingly it wasn't the same Jim Carrey that we all know from Ace Ventura, and The Mask. He was massively toned down in this movie, showing no traces of his trademark acting style (believe me, this is a good thing). This made his character all the more believable. The two of them worked surprisingly well as passionate lovers who descend into the relationship hell of resentment and jealousy.  The film shows how time truly destroys all things as even the most passionate of relationships can and will erode eventually. Yet the most striking message that the movie portrays is the power of memory and the incredible effect that it has on the human psyche, because although we grow old and all things come to an end, it is the memories in life that define us, who we were, and who we loved.",9,0,1,1 April 2004
