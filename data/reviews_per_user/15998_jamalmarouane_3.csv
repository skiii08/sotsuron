Spirited Away," SO DISAPPOINTED!!
","I really wants to like this movie but i can't
I watched it because of the recommendations and because it is the second-highest-grossing anime film of all time worldwide but I was very bored during all the time characters were just appearing strangely with no explanation and the events were just so bad I mean like the father who has to go check his new home didn't want to take rest he wants to discover that place so bad oddly
I only watch it because I liked the movie YOUR NAME which was a masterpiece of art and iI asked for something similar and I ended up wasting 2 hours of my life but the music was awesome
Please someone tell me why it is good and popular i really want to like this movie but i can't",5,0,1,22 January 2019
