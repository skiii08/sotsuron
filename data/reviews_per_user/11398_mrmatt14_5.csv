3:10 to Yuma," I hate westerns
","As a general rule, I hate westerns. I can't relate to them enough to care about the characters. Even when I can see there's something worthwhile in the story, the trappings of the genre place enough of a disconnect to keep me out of the story.It was with much trepidation that I took a friend's recommendation to watch this movie. I agreed mainly because I respect both Bale and Crowe enough to give it the benefit of the doubt.Despite being somewhat talky, there's not much in the script to make it something the movie can rely upon. In the end, do I honestly believe that the two lead actors to embody characters that can forge enough of a bond that the facades fall away and they have to deal with each other as real people?With due credit to Logan Lerman, acting as a mirror to the hearts of both of the leads, I can honestly say that Crowe and Bale each achieve their formidable task. I walk away wondering if I would have the courage to act as either Wade or Evans did, and I honestly don't know.If that's not the sign of a film worth watching, I'm not sure what is. I may have to give westerns another chance.",10,2,4,1 October 2009
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," I didn't expect much, and it delivered
","To be honest, after the horrid Episode 1, I didn't expect much from Episode 2.  Because of that, I can't say I was disappointed.  Lucas delivered about what I expected.It was gorgeous, and it truly sets a new standard for special effects in film.  The problem was that it doesn't integrate the actors well in places -- it looks bluescreened.To complain about the normal stuff, the dialogue was hokey (Yoda's lines sounded the most natural), the acting was stiff, and the directing was non-existent.  For the most part, the actors do an OK job of pretending to see something that isn't there, but it's a stretch at times.
Natalie Portman has established herself as a fine and powerful actress, but I kept feeling like she had to dumb it down for the role and play down to the more limited talents and experience of her costars.
Hayden Christensen is pretty, but that's about it.  He looks pompous and spoiled when he's supposed to be immature, and he looks constipated when he's supposed to look dark and brooding.  Forget about the 'sexual chemistry' between him and Portman that supposedly won him the role -- it didn't translate to film at all.Ewan McGregor is the film's one laudable success.  He character has matured since TPM and he has adopted a style and accent that could conceivably grow into Sir Alec Guinness.  The lines are trite, but the performance is admirable.The faults for this film, ultimately, lie solely on the shoulders of George Lucas.  With the budget, the franchise, and the guaranteed returns, this movie could have commanded all the might of Hollywood, yet he retained the script and directorial reigns.  A good script and a solid director could have made this movie work.  Lucas is a brilliant mind and a top-notch visual effects guy, but a writer and director he is not.  A perfect example is the event which really marks the turn in Anakin to the dark side.  They hint at it, they talk briefly about it, but the single most significant event of all six movies wasn't shown for the true horror that it was supposed to invoke. Sure, it might have taken some careful editing to avoid the R-rating, but we're talking about the event that sends the innocent blonde kid down the road to Darth Vader.Even he has conceded that TPM was a disappointment, but rather than purge the worst of the first, he tries to salvage them.  GEORGE - IF YOU'RE READING THIS -- JAR JAR NEEDS TO GO AWAY.  A 'limited role' isn't good enough.  GONE.  GOODBYE.  NO MORE.  There's also the Pod Race II -- same ole thing in 3D with guns.  Admit mistakes, let them go, and move on.Perhaps the worst element was the misplaced attempts at suspense.  This is a prequel, so we know that Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Amidala will live.  To go through extended action sequences which place their lives in jeopardy is insulting.   We all know they're not in any real danger, so don't waste our time.  There is only one fight sequence that's worth noting, and that's the much commented-upon light saber fight at the end.  (And no, I'm not talking about Yoda -- that was tacky.)  There was an element of mystery because we didn't know if the bad guy was going to buy it, but it's notable because it was simply gorgeous -- perfectly choreographed and visually stunning.I'll grant that the Star Wars franchise is a difficult task to undertake. It's a much-anticipated epic with a religious following.  I can only hope that Lucas will focus on what he's truly good at, and let others handle the rest.  Peter Jackson might be a good source of input -- he's got some experience in such matters.",3,0,0,16 May 2002
Resident Evil," Lightweight, mindless eye candy
","Not that that's a bad thing.  Although I generally like more substantial fare, sometimes it's nice to have a fun movie come along.  Unlike so many other action/thriller movies out there that pretend to be so much more than they actually are, this one makes no attempt to try to carry a meaningful plot or intelligent dialogue.  It's pure escapism, and it's fun to watch.I have to hand it to the creative team behind this one, as it cooks up new and creative ways to kill people.  But the violence isn't as mindless as the rest of the movie -- there's still that sense of shock and horror when someone gets killed.Oh yeah, and get ready for the sequel -- this one's not even subtle about setting up for Resident Evil II - Escape from Racoon City.",7,0,0,17 March 2002
The Number 23," So much wasted potential
","Hrmm... where to start.Matthew Libatuque is about as good of a cinematographer as there is working, and for the visually inclined out there, this one is a feast.Jim Carrey.... hrmm... Jim Carrey. I like it when comic actors play dark, as long as it's done well. He does this one well, but he's still the wrong actor for the role. There's a difference between being dark and playing dark, and unfortunately, he was just playing. This one was SCREAMING for Colin Farrell, but instead we get Jim Carrey proving that he really can act.But as for the movie, I can simply say it's a mixed bag, and the fault there goes to Joel Schumacher. He gets credit for being a mainstream director who likes the dark material, but once again (*ahem* 8mm) he either doesn't understand the material, or isn't willing to stick up for it's integrity in the face of his big studio bosses. Either way, David Fincher could have done wonders with this, or Christopher Nolan, or any of the other directors who have a talent with solid, dark material.The ending is the ultimate fault of the movie. Obviously, some suspension of disbelief is required for something like this, but the ending so strains credulity that it ruins some otherwise noteworthy work in the rest of the film. There are so many excellent directions this could have gone, but Schumacher opted for clever, and that relegates this one to little more than a renter.",6,21,43,20 February 2007
Saw," I'll never look at a tricycle the same way again!
","I got to see this film at a screening tonight, and had the added honor of having the filmmakers there for a Q&A to introduce and follow the movie.The acting wasn't stellar, and the movie itself was admittedly a little rough around the edges, but none of that really mattered. It was one of the most intense and disturbing movies I've ever seen. It became pretty clear why that was so during the Q&A. The filmmakers mentioned that they had been approached about just selling the script, but since they had worked so hard on it for so long, that it was their project and they were going to hold out until Wan could direct and they would maintain control over the script. And thankfully, Evolution gave them the funding and left them with creative control of the project.The result is that the whole movie has a level of internal cohesion that can only come when the project is a labor of love from concept, through development, and ultimately into production. Despite the faults of the movie, it still worked amazingly well, and had such a profound effect, because it was made by people who intimately knew every nook and cranny of the script, concept, and plot. My fear is that this movie will go the way of Blair Witch (about which I had very similar feelings.) This movie will benefit from some very well deserved positive word of mouth, but it's just too intense, and too much of a niche film to live up to the mass market's expectations. This is NOT a movie for the general movie going public. This is a movie for people who appreciate the art of film-making, and want to be scared and frightened by a challenging work. If the average popcorn muncher makes it through 45 minutes of this one, I'll be impressed. For those who go -- and I recommend it highly -- be ready for a unique experience that one can never truly be prepared for.",10,2,3,27 September 2004
