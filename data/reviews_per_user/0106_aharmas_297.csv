The King's Speech," Behind Every King There's a....
","What makes the movie fascinating is that it's based on a true story, and from what I heard, it's based on a play, and its biggest achievement is that it never feels stagey, that it's entertaining, that it's got some sublime acting, mostly Firth and Bonham-Carter, though Rush is very good, too. In general, it's a nice film. The one thing that hurts it a little is the setting, the fact that had it been based on lesser humans, it might have had a stronger impact. Seeing the royal nature of things, after being exposed to so much of this type of drama in the last three or four decades, feels a bit boring. I couldn't help but noticing how hard the cinematographer tried to make it look different, and for a while I thought I had kept my shades on because the film look so dark.Now, looking at what works, as I mentioned before Firth is spectacular, giving a very natural and human spin to what could have a tired turn. We have seen how hard actors tried to show their technical skills, and it's Firth's gift that he can make a stutter emotional and frustrating, that we see how his soul hurts, and his spirit breaks over and over, as he tries to overcome his disability. He knows where he belongs, the pressures he is under, and he hates the spotlight, and all of this is perfectly reflected in his performance. Coming in to give it an interesting balance is the subtle and affecting work by Bonham-Carter, showing an amazing range and getting further from the loud histrionics of both 'Potter' and 'Wonderland', two great turns, but it's her sweet support, both in the film, and in her acting that is rewarding. She is perfectly attuned to her part and is a great partner to Firth. Both of them do act like full human beings who just happen to be royalty. She had plenty of practice before getting here. Firth is perfect in this type of role.Coming so soon after 'A Single Man', we're not truly surprised Firth could do any better. In fact, it's just a different type of role, and he handles it with so much aplomb that it feels natural, noticeable without being too much, interesting, one piece of acting that will eventually be mentioned among the best of someone's career, or of anything in the movies. In this case, it doesn't matter what the man is wearing, his soul and his pain are real, and his desire to overcome his obstacles and please those around him, most importantly his closest family and friends is what fuels the intensity of the performance. Every syllable, every gesture, every look, and every exchange between him and the other actors has a purpose and never loses its direction and focus. That is what makes the conclusion so satisfying and appeals to us.This film doesn't forget the human connection with its audience. A few years ago 'The Queen' explored the inner conflicts of a woman who wasn't sure of her station, and we have seen 'Elizabeth' and the political drama of the period, but it's the human side that is so often neglected, and 'The King's Speech' has made sure it remains at the forefront of the main crisis. It's critical that we like this man, regardless of who he is, and we do. We want him to succeed, to have his 'Rocky' moment, and the question is how much are you going to enjoy the ending? Very nice indeed.",9,7,12,13 December 2010
Insidious: Chapter 2," More Horrific Trauma!!!
","James Wan does it again. He continues the saga of the family that is being haunted by a demonic entity, and this time there are plenty of surprises, and some genuine spooky moments.For starters, Patrick Wilson takes the spotlight in one of the simultaneous stories and does pretty well, as the man with more than one connection to the after world. The big question is whether he is any help at all this time around. Before you can see, 'there she goes again', we are taken on a ride in and out of the after world, the past, and the present is turning out scarier and scarier.It is always a ton of fun to see professionals like Barbara Hershey take on roles where she is in danger since she's such a powerful presence, and this time she must confront a spirit that's hurting a couple of generations in her family. She enlists the help of three professionals who might need every resource at their disposal to deal with the evil presence.One of the best parts in part I was the steady hand of the director, as the impending sense of doom took over and had us on the edge of our seats. This time, we are already in the middle of the mess, and it takes more to upset us, but the story is interesting, and things seem to head for absolute tragedy unless something happens, or someone comes to the rescue.Let's just say the audience will most likely be pleased with the experience, and we are more than ready for the follow up.",9,1,3,15 September 2013
The Avengers," And The Winner Is
","If there's a genre that's evolving and becoming better and better in the last decade, it's the adventure/comic genre; not solely a result of better CGI and cinematographic techniques, but there is also much better writing and acting, and in previous years, efforts by Nolan and Joe Johnston have been bypassed by critic and association entities because they are not a specific type of picture. It is certainly my hope this brilliant film doesn't suffer the same fate for it's great cinema all the way.With a superb cast that appears to embody each of the super heroes, and most intriguingly, their own stunts, we are treated to a very exciting two hours plus at the movies where the Earth is once again in danger of being overcome by an alien race, and somehow, story lines from several films are tied together neatly. Eventually, they all become a cohesive whole, and the results are MARVELous!! The film is terrific, and it might not reach the levels of perfection that we saw in 'The Dark Knight', a movie so magnificent in its structure and sustained by terrific writing and acting. There's certainly no villain like the Joker here, but the evil forces are sufficient enough to warrant a cry for help, so that we need our heroes to come and kick some alien butt. It's definitely a showcase for all involved: Renner, Downey (much warmer) than in any of his previous turns as Ironman, Johanssen is magnificent, Evans is fantastic, Hemsworth is royal like in his turn, but the best turn out there is sheer force of nature that Ruffalo gives to the Hulk. He certainly walks away with the picture, yet everyone else gives him plenty of competition for the spotlight.The film is a crowd pleaser, with plenty of terrific set pieces, leading to an extraordinary third act, a piece of cinematic action rarely seen before, where every element moves so smoothly, it can make your heart soar when you see what really good films can achieve. It certainly doesn't remind me of some of the films that have been recognized in the last decade, as the best that cinema can offer. Good film do not have to be serious; they have to be well made, regardless of what the subject matter is, and 'The Avengers' once have proved just how amazing solid script writing (by one person, not a whole team of creative ideas) can give you when you combine with top of the line special effects. It's truly a joy to see Jackson sharp tuning a role we have seen before, but it's now full of pizazz.There are some terrific possibilities coming our way later this year, and I am looking forward to the amazing offerings by Nolan, Scott, and Sonnenfield, but they have a battle uphill trying to match this wonderful movie. Watch, learn, and learn to give credit where credit is due. This is cinema at its best.",9,6,12,6 May 2012
Angels & Demons," Duality
","Tom Hanks returns, at least in typical Hollywood adaptation chronology, as the scientist who likes to stir a little controversy by adding a bit of theology to his adventures. In 'Angels and Demons' he is searching for the clues that will help him save a few lives at the Vatican's request.There is a tug of war between what traditions expect from the church followers and how science is reshaping everyone's understanding and perspective of what how the universe has got this far. There is not much of a back story this time, if you don't count the Galileo piece. Howard dives into the action and directs with a more self assured hand, with plenty of help from two very charismatic stars, and a terrific supporting performance by McGregor, as the priest who can open more than a few doors in this place.Intrigue is at the heart of the film, mysticism takes a backseat to the debate that originates from the coexistence of science and faith. The screenplay gives everyone a chance to present and make a point, and by the end of the adventure, we might have a very pleased audience.",8,2,3,25 May 2009
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Let's Play Now
","So, because of a marketing decision, the last book of the series has been divided into two movies, and the audience exploded. Why was it necessary to make it this way? After seeing the first movie, it's perfectly obvious that this is not an epic, but it is not a bad film either. People could argue that we needed to see the transition of our heroine from shell shocked to fully capable of leading the revolution. When you see the first installment, you'll be the judge.Everything is literally a mess in her world. She has left her beloved behind and is now facing new responsibilities and a different world. She doesn't even know whether who is alive or dead. What becomes obvious is that everyone else seems to be adapting much faster. We go through a similar process than they she went through in the first two films. Learning how to use new weapons, strategies, and adapting to new situations, but this time it is more personal, and it is difficult to know what is really going on.The pacing is slow, and there is plenty of time to reflect on the recent events; it is also noticeable that both Presidents are very sly political and wartime players. One will discover as the story progresses that not everything is what it seems. It is commendable that we don't need all of those physical training exercises we saw in 'Divergent'. They revealed nothing about the characters, which remained flat and boring. Here we care about the players involved, we sort of admire the bad guys, too because there is a game going on, and we know they're well matched. Yes, we need to see her catch fire, to explode, so she can reach her full potential, and we already know the ending, but what we don't know is how many twists and surprises there will be until its resolution.Yes, it is pushing our patience to see what could have a been a much better three hour film unfold this slowly. It wasn't necessary unless we were watching a TV series. It is not a character study, but a young adult thriller, and maybe a year is just too long. What if we just wait a couple of months, or at the most six months, like do on TV. It is just unnecessary torture.",7,2,13,7 December 2014
Vertigo," The Perfect Valentine, with a Very Turbulent Twist
","Many of the scenes in 'Vertigo' rely on the fabulous and wistful score that accentuates the various stages of development in the story. We become intrinsically involved with the lives of the characters as the orchestra envelopes us into the role of the voyeur that can't believe what he is witnessing. We understand where the obsession comes from. It is impossible to gauge the intensity of the power with which it has taken over our hero's life.Kim Novak is deadly perfect as the siren who seduces Jimmy Stewart's detective. She is as cold and alluring in her original portrayal of the suicidal heiress. Eventually she wins us over as the desperate and repentful woman who must surrender her independence to achieve her dreams/nightmares. The film begins as a detective story that goes wrong because suddenly the expectations go awry. Nothing on the screen is at is started. Our hero is an obsessed necrophiliac. The object of his desire is a lovely, disturbed woman, who is as insecure as anything to ever show up in a 50's movie. Still, Novak makes her lovely, mysterious, alluring, carnal, spiritually flawed, and in the end, the perfect victim.The biggest surprise of the movie is Stewart, playing a very disturbed character, with more problems that anyone should be able to survive. The film is a lovely valentine because in spite of the dark themes it explores, it shows us how little controls human really have over their fate and their choices. Herrman's score is the soul of the film, and Hitchcock's direction is as masterful as ever, probably the best he ever did.'Vertigo' deserves its ranking among the finest films ever made. It is sweet and passionate, pure and rank, a masterful portrayal of blooming love and its decaying ends.",10,5,6,15 June 2007
Black Swan," Ruffling Feathers
","A couple of the other reviews mentioned that this film belonged in the horror category rather than the psychological thriller. For starters, it's probably a combination of both, and the confusion might originate from the fact that once again there are too many cooks in here. In my opinion, to remain focused in a film like this is the key, and at times, it does lose its way, but thank God it remains entertaining throughout, and this is the result of the acting and directing talent. As the nightmare evolves and personalities as well as egos are shattered, we remain glued to the screen to see how bad the wreck is going to be. The conclusion might start a debate, but I doubt it will reach the heights of movies like 'Fatal Attraction' or 'The Sixth Sense' In general the film has a very good premise, reality mirrors art, and art's intensity benefits from an overactive mind, or maybe a few minds. Everyone involved has something to contribute, and at the center there is the, way too tortured performance by Portman, who does a decent job, portraying the Swan Queen, but who could have added a bit more darker shading to her role. She is truly mesmerizing for about five minutes in the last third of the film, but there was a time when I wished the Lily character could have dispatched her, so we could have a more interesting film. It might not be Portman's fault that her character doesn't quite reach the expected heights, but we have Hershey and Cassell pulling the strings, and those two can certainly throw some curves and keep us guessing. We know they have a direct effect on Nina's behavior and ultimate fate. Their acting is spellbinding, and only if those lines were a bit sharper, then even Hitchcock would have a problem finding fault here.In the film, the main character is seduced, haunted, stalked, tortured, abused, and possibly every sort of evil action is either done or hinted at. For a while we don't really understand who or what is doing, and the question is where does reality begin and end? Pressures grow, deadlines near, jealousy flares, and for a while even, a dash of sex adds some interesting perspective to the mix. Things become darker, paranoia grows, and we know one way or another, the end results aren't going to be pretty.So, come in and expect to be entertained, and watch as the seeds of jealousy and resentment can poison even the best of us, and how some technical virtuosity can almost save a weak script. Sometimes getting the right actors and directors does make a big difference. It certainly does here.",7,3,7,13 December 2010
Changeling," Eastwood and Angeline deliver a strong punch
","There is nothing more reliable than Eastwood behind the camera, with his assured touch his films are never boring or deliberately confusing, hiding technical devices or special effects that detract from the most important part of movie making: a good screenplay, a good story, good acting. For the past 10 years, many films have been unduly praised because they have one or two great performances, unfairly leaving many good and deserving movies without the recognition they deserved. Eastwood has however, given us the whole package time after time, with movies as varied as 'Mystic River', 'Letters', 'Million Dollar Baby' and now 'Changeling'. True, there is a link, they are all strong films, with themes that deal with pain and loss, but the stories are different, the settings require an amazing attention to detail, what they all share is a strong focus, and interestingly enough, superb performances.Eastwood has paved the way to acting honors for Penn, Freeman, Swank, Hackman, and others that were continuously ignored by the Academy. There is no denying the power of their performances in Eastwood's movies, and that leads to the center of this film: Jolie. I read recently that her performance has been attacked as being affected and the attempt of a star to look normal. Putting aside those silly and biased remarks, let's state something clearly, the lady has given us a fantastic tour de force, proving that she can be both a star when looking at the other cameras, but that when she is working for a director, she gives her best, regardless of what our perception of her private life might be. If you are a critic with a personal disapproval of that persona, keep it to yourself, concentrate on the film and the work of the performer.As the mother who desperately wants the truth about her child, Angelina is flawless. We can read the pain in her eyes, the determination and the disturbing reality that her obsession might be having unexpected results, but one thing is clear, there is a drive that won't quit, and it's admirable for those of us who want her to be reunited with her child, and it's quite inconvenient for the people who have other interests at hand.Her battle with the folks at LAPD is of epic proportions, and it is amazing that she held on to her goal of exposing the corruption that she encountered as she searched for her missing boy. There are some horrific moments in the film, as we relieve some of the injustices and Gothic horror of places like the hospital in this film. There are also some background scene that might or not reveal what really happen. There are moments when one is a bit exhausted from all the information the film delivers, but every moment is worth it. It is all framed with an expert hand, and it is anchored by the very powerful work by Jolie and the rest of an amazing cast that brings to life emotions such as madness, anger, pain, sorrow, and many times, disbelief that humans can be capable of such terrible actions.The film contains amazing production values, as we are taken back to an era that doesn't exist anymore. The recreation of the time Los Angeles was on its way to being a real city is incredible, as we see it before it fell apart and spread all over a gigantic geographical area, losing its identity. The musical score is a sweet melody that hints at the love and pain themes in the film, and there are some moments bound to become classic, as children tell the stories that adults might not want to face or believe.All in all, 'Changeling' may be very difficult to sit through, but it is not less impressive, effective or good than any of the last five films Eastwood has made. As a matter of fact, it's just one masterpiece from the man who could teach Hollywood a few lessons.",10,312,397,2 November 2008
Men in Black 3," If only, if only, the rest of the film matched that ending
","Once again, the previews had the best parts of the movie. We were waiting to see more of that, knowing that the chemistry between Smith and Jones worked well, given the right dialog/scenery. Smith is wonderful at being reactive, and Jones can say so much without saying anything. He has that face people respond, too. The premise of having him disappear sent shivers down the spine because everything would be out of balance, unless we brought him back with just another actor who could do exactly the same thing.This part works well, but whereas Michael J. Fox does wonders in the three 'Back to The Future' films, the plot twist is barely developed here, and there are several missed opportunities. Brolin is dead perfect as the young Jones. He actually looks and acts as a biological young version of him.There is too much talking in the film, and it's not clever, amusing, or entertaining. It just drags and takes the fun out of the conflict, fish out of water storyline. The creative team tries to lessen the damage by adding some more 'amusing' aliens along the way, a 'future' reader who is likable but gets a bit tiring pretty soon, and there we encounter more missed opportunities.The film tries to restore some of its magic in the last fifteen minutes, and this might just a little too late for us. As we do react to the hidden elements of the 'classified' file. It's a classic and sweet moment which rings true and explains a lot. However it feels like someone else wrote, either as a last minute script remedy, or it was just a piece of the original idea that was never developed enough for the middle section of the film.One last request to Hollywood: YOU need to give us a GOOD or BAD villain, someone we can count us to entertain us, scare us, make us react and somehow cheer or despise because he/she earns that right, not because we're just supposed to manipulated by the money factory.",5,1,5,3 June 2012
The New World," Lovely Reflection on Human Nature
","It broke my heart to see how a few patrons walked out of this film without giving themselves a chance to experience one of the most intense and transcendental experiences of a lifetime. This film reaches beyond what words can say and truly forces one to look inwards and connect back with worlds that don't exist anymore.There is a purity to the beauty and intensity of the feelings Mallick has managed to convey in his storytelling. There is no much dialogue, and at times the film appears to move very slowly; this is what appears to be problematic for a few members of the audience. It is as if action has to be symbolized by outburst of special effects and inane dialogue where a simple look or a gorgeous depiction of how we are one with nature suffices. The film uses plenty of symbols to show how we are one with this world; whether it is new or old. How mother nature must feel neglected by our decisions to embrace modern technology, or the latest novelty of whatever type it must be.It would be incorrect to call the film simple because it is a very complex and meditative look at how our world and our lives change. Through the eyes of a very intelligent and perceptive man, we are exposed to places our souls rarely encounter. There is direct power to the images in the movie: the flow of the water, the clouds in the sky, the dance of the smoke, the visceral moves of the various human beings. In 'The New World' an embrace, a look, a slight touch carry endless and powerful meanings to the people in and off the screen. The audience is carried along and should be able to tremble with the passion and tenderness the movie's protagonists experience. Without reservations, all the film's principals do an outstanding jobs in their respective roles: Christopher Plummer, as the wise captain who truly understands what it means to see a new civilization. His choice of words says much about what he has encountered in Virginia, as he calls the local people, 'naturals'. John Smith is played quietly and with much insight by Colin Farrell, an actor who can do marvelous work in quality films. His tortured adventurer is man who doesn't belong in his century, as he able to see beyond what lies before him, but he is also unable to comprehend the power of what surrounds him. In a second masterful turn this year, Christian Bale proves himself a very competent actor, as the introspective soul who doesn't want to change destiny but goes along with fate, whether this could mean more sadness or his desired happiness. He is superb this time out.Yet, the film belongs to a newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher, giving a performance as lovely, complex, and as magnificent as anything some of our greatest actresses have done. Her expressive eyes are the link between the soul of man and the essence of nature. Her physical gestures reflect on how her world is adapting to the new forces that are now intruding upon it. Her love scenes are some of the most beautiful and romantic ever put on screen, intense because of their purity. There is no wasted dialogue, no overblown musical score pushing the inability of a less capable director, nothing else is needed but a close up of a young woman who tells us how amazing humanity can be.Throughout the film, there are several moments where the audience can't help but gasping at how far we have departed from what we truly are. Nothing rings false in here, as we see how far our feelings can carry us. There is such a range from the generosity of several of the characters in the film, to the fear and despair some of the first arrivals had to go through.Much is to be praised about its technical aspects as well, in particular about the gorgeous score by James Horner and the unbelievably beautiful cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezky. Jack Fisk's and Jacqueline West's art direction and costume design were truly inspired, and the great screenplay by Mr. Malick should be studied by those who want to explore, discover, and understand how a true master of cinema works to produce a lovely canvas.I could go and on, praising this superb film; however it is not fair for me to tell you what it is. It is for you to go and discover its pleasures as your senses are enveloped by the experience.",10,25,53,26 December 2005
Walk the Line," That Slow Burning Country Man Heats Up The Screen
","It's great to see a movie where talent shines and music rocks! When I first saw that preview, it was a bit strange to see Reese as a brunette. Now I can't imagine her going back to just a blonde. She is fantastic in this film and shows how truly talented she has always been. She also does some really good singing. She is also a perfect match for a man who gives a fiery performance, as the man in black.Phoenix's intense portrayal of the man who must endure a life of pain and conflicting emotions is a refreshing country biography, after so many films that a bit self-important in their over-adoration of their biographical tributes. Here is man, whose major accomplishment is to share with us how life treats him, who is unable to conquer his demons easily, and who is lucky enough to find a match for him in his travels through life.Not a big fan of country music myself, but I couldn't help going with the beat and admiring every one of the numbers that Ms. Witherspoon and Mr. Phoenix recreate for us in the screen. Here is a film that should be honored later in the year. It certainly ranks as an honest and entertaining film, one that shows admiration for the man it portrays, doesn't sanctify, condemn, or dehumanize him in any way to suit the studios or satisfy the masses. As a matter of fact, one of the most bone-chilling moments is seeing that zealot in the middle of the film criticize June in the store. It is horrible to see our losing the ability to understand and truly see ourselves. The film is fair and gives everyone a chance to show how music can somehow at least help us go on and deal with life.",9,1,3,21 November 2005
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Style vs Substance
","Guy Ritchie has proved himself quite a stylish director. He has given us 'Rock'n'Rolla' and the first of the Sherlock series before. Somehow, he has lost control of the material recently, and this is most obvious in the latest entry Holmes entry.The film is a visual stunner, easily with 'The Tree of Life' and 'HP VII/ Part II', one of the best looking movies ever filmed. This film truly transports us back to the early days of the XX Century and makes us feel like we are really in the middle of the very polluted capitals of Europe, the exquisite photography immersing us in the world of shadows which was part of that society day and night. The film allows us to almost feel the torture of the upholstery, the lush velvet of the costumes, and the sumptuous decadence of the wealthy classes. Every aspect of the art direction should be recognized as the best of the best, and I wish the story would be allowed to reach those levels.Doyle's Holmes and Watson are truly two of the most intelligent and fascinating characters in literature; as a pair, they might have no match, and Moriarty is the perfect villain, but the way these films treat the development of the story and the characters themselves is a shame, for Ritchie prefers to have slow motion takes to show bullets or flash editing to detract from the impact of a good action scene. He does redeem himself twice in the scenes with Moriarty and Holmes, but that is what makes the whole two hours truly frustrating because one yearns for more of what could have made the films great, and we get a lot of beautiful shots of violence and mayhem, but little of what truly matters.This film takes us through the philosophical studies of what man's self destructive nature, and how evil geniuses profit from man's tragic disposition. As I mentioned before because of the film's truncated style, it is hard to truly appreciate the battle of the minds. It is a cat and mouse chase through some lovely scenery and it ends with the ultimate solution, the final solution, a chess move so diabolical, the audiences gasp, and in what could have an amazing cliffhanger, with a true open end, or not, depending on how carefully you have reviewed the clues along the way, Ritchie goes the easy away. Can we hear the audience papers results being read? Downey and Law do very well. Rapace is truly wasted, and it is hard to believe she gave the best performance of the year in 2010. In this film, we are in for easy laughs, little is explained as to why Holmes want to blend into the background or dress as a cheap slut. His mind is best asset but you couldn't tell from this film. You'll have a better time reading the short stories or checking out the old films. Now that would make sense.",5,80,140,18 December 2011
The Incredible Hulk," This hulk hits every mark!
","At first, I wondered why they were releasing this 'adaptation' so quickly after the Ang Lee version. I hadn't recovered from that disappointment and didn't have much confidence the new movie would get it right, either. It was specially daunting, coming right behind 'Ironman', but there some intriguing variables, most importantly, the fact that Edward Norton was playing our doomed scientist. Finally, I must admit that the new 'Hulk' is everything a film of this genre should be: exciting, interesting, very nice to look, showing a range of emotions, and most importantly, it leaves you hoping there is a sequel really soon! The excitement never lets up in this one. From the introduction of the 'hulk' when the original experiment goes awry. Later on, other pieces come together, and we understand how each of the participants contributed to the tragic transformation of our hero. It is the trademark of a good screenwriter than he is able to create multidimensional characters, without relying too much on narration or extended dialog pieces. Most of the information is delivered visually, through montages, and a couple of lines placed at the right moment in key scenes to recall past events. Some of the film is even told in a foreign language, and it doesn't seem to matter because it completes that particular chapter and adds truth to the scene.In addition to being exciting, the film is a pleasure to watch, as we follow our hero through his odyssey from Brazil to Guatemala and back to the states. Great camera work adds plenty of mood to each scene. The director and cinematographer have seamless added special effects to a beautifully shot movie. Gone were my reservations about the look of the 'monster' in the first film. This time, the new hulk is able to project his emotions without calling much attention to the FX. The Hulk is actually capable of showing a range of emotions ranging from desperation to anger, and it touches us.It is also refreshing to see a love story in the middle of this action fantasy film. It gives every character a much need dimension that is usually missing from this type of adventures. The lovely Liv Tyler has amazing chemistry with Norton and fully supports the main character as he moves through his adventures.And let's not forget that final scene... if i was craving a sequel from its opening scene, I couldn't restrain myself from gasping when I saw the guest star who shows up at the last minute to exchange a few words with the William Hurt character. I'm dying to see what happens next.",10,6,10,15 June 2008
The Monuments Men," Bland Movie
","Here is a film that could have moved us, inspired us, catapulted a new angle to Historical events in ways we couldn't even imagine. Instead, we're treated to one movie that is at best sketchy, sort of half baked pastry, a raw steak, a wall with barely a coat of paint and plenty to complete. There is a good cast, an interesting story that is never fully developed, and one Desplat's laziest musical scores, full of musical clichés, and half-hearted military themes. One can't help referring to classic gems. Here sets look like sets, costumes never quite feel or look realistic... The only thing that looks real are the pieces of art, and yes, there is an actor that not even this film can bring down, Ms. Blanchett. She earns once again great marks for putting what little soul is in the movie. She is the only character who really seems to care about the pieces of art. Others talk about saving them. She is the only one who puts passion in her delivery, her acting, her looks. She transforms herself into an important piece of the puzzle. It's just too bad the rest of the pieces don't fit.We follow a special squad as they try to rescue thousands of pieces of art that Hittler has appropriated as he conquers most of Europe. It's a race against time because if they don't find those artworks, they might be destroyed and lost forever. Our heroes are not quite prepared for some of the tasks, and soon tragedy strikes, making them realize this might be too much to handle.It's a pity that there is little heart in the movie, and that no matter how handsome the troop looks, the bad guys show up a couple of times, shoot them, burn a few paintings, and threaten to make things worse. It's amazing they are representatives of one of the worst embodiments of evil civilization has ever seen. There is also a bothersome tone to the film. It feels like this has a tongue in cheek attitude that doesn't quite fit. This is serious stuff, and that angle is at best not very respectful.Maybe someone will remake it soon, and we will get a better presentation of an interesting part of history.",Null,3,4,17 February 2014
Mission: Impossible III," Uninvolving, Boring, and Too Long
","J.J. Abrahams is a hell of a filmmaker. It is his contribution to this project that makes it semi bearable. Sadly enough, the film needed some more careful trimming in order to make it as enjoyable as some of the 'Alias' episodes that Abrahams wrote and directed. Instead we are given an overlong and pretentious plot that can barely sustain itself with overblown action scenes that call too much attention to themselves, has some very talented supporting actors in roles that demand nothing from them except sitting behind a wheel or standing around with vacant looks that pretty much reflect the audience's reactions to this boring film.Why is it that we are expected to like remakes that are uninteresting, tired, and poorly executed? Classic movies became what they were because they didn't lack originality or imagination. They were made by talented people who knew when to leave egos aside and work on what mattered: a good story! Wait for the video, at least you can fast forward that one.",5,0,0,13 May 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Fabulous, Fantastic, Filling
","I decided to go to this film after reading a couple of very interesting reviews in the local newspapers. They were hinting at something different and intriguing, but the reviewers appeared reluctant to admit they were bowled over by the film. I tend to be distrustful of reviewers who 'love' a film since it usually reflects the movie might be a little too different and might just be trying to hard to do something new. 'Slevin' doesn't try to reinvent the genre (whatever it might be in this case), but it does certainly present sharper portrayals of prototypes we have encountered before, and there is also much more care given to a storyline that could easily baffle audiences. Instead, here is a film that delivers, with a very satisfying payoff!! 2006 has definitely given us outstanding work by Bruce Willis, an actor that manages to prove he is very reliable, versatile, and quite talented in some very unorthodox vehicles ('Pulp Fiction', '16 Blocks'). He now embodies the epitome of cool, with a performance that shows he can be white hot and put enough energy to keep this very unpredictable tale going.The movie is an ensemble piece, and Bruce stands out as one of the mysterious pieces in the movie. There is great work by both Freeman and Kingsley who are two of the most versatile and best actors of their generation. When they are in their separate scenes they dominate the screen, when they are both together, the results are explosive. Lucy Liu is sweet and quite effective as the romantic performer. Josh Harnett makes a bid again for stardom in a performance that shows the right script can do wonders for talent like his.Going through the elaborate screenplay requires multiple viewings, but watching it for the first time can be a very enjoyable ride. It is only fair to say that any of the classic Greek tragedies certainly provided inspiration for the multiple twists and clever plot lines that hold the story together. The screenplay is the work of writer who understands background and depth are necessary to create interesting characters.Be prepared to see the multiple sides of the underbelly of society, and how deceptive looks and appearances can be. Also some stereotypes will be shattered as the writer allows its audience to have fun along the way. 'The Usual Suspects' was only the introduction to the wildest ride of the year. Hope this is remembered later in the year because this is outstanding film-making, and whoever said that being bad doesn't pay, might not be rethnking that appreciation.",10,1,7,16 April 2006
Captain Phillips," A New Classic and Hanks at HIs Very Best
","2013 is beginning to look a lot like 1939, a year full of films that will live on as classics. In spite of all the duds and overpraised movies that we have seen, a certain domestic comes to mind... We have seen some excellent movie making, sometimes a week after another. Here is the real life ordeal of a man who must confront death face to face, endure major physical and psychological trauma under very dangerous circumstances. One couldn't imagine Tom Hanks to give such a performance at this stage of his career, but he manages to surpass most of the work he has done before, and that's quite an achievement.Captain Phillips and his crew fall victim to a group of desperate pirates near the coast of Africa. This group's enterprise at its best clumsy, and we know things will not turn out very well. The Somalians look famished, desperate, fearful, and hungry for some type of financial sustenance. Their existence is at the mercy of crime lords who constantly abuse them and demand more and more from people who are barely surviving. It's hard not to pity them, but it's also hard not to feel empathy for anyone portrayed by Hanks, and from his early scenes, this character carries with him a strong sense of decency and fairness. It's almost impossible to not feel his rights have been compromised by society's screwed social and economic woes.Greengrass keeps the reins tight throughout most of the film, with the help of hand held cameras, some marvelous editing, and spare background music. Here it all depends on the performances, the direction, the way nothing relies on posturing and lethargic storytelling. Here the tension never lags, the film is saturated with emotions that have us involved. Every word counts, every turn is relevant. There is no wasted minute.Hanks is present in every frame of the film, and we can see how good he is at portraying intelligence, sympathy, and a little bit of duplicity as he tries to find a way to save himself and his crew. It almost works most of the time, but even he can't foretell what surprises might come his way. He survives because he is both lucky and resourceful, and from the amazing last fifteen minutes of his performance, one might even believe that he didn't realize how close he was to dying.It's hard not to be impressed by the many layers of his performance, and I am still wondering where a double was used, particularly in the underwater scenes. I wouldn't be surprised if Hanks didn't do that himself. Much credit for the consistency of the performance should also go to the actors playing the Somalians. They are not simple sketches. They look and act like real people, people at the end of their ropes, searching for a way out, but they do know they can't escape their fates. It's not when, but how they will finally succumb, and it's heartbreaking to see their demise.There will be plenty of talk about the last fifteen minutes of the movie, a departure from the typical movie ending. Here a human being is portrayed very realistically, and Hanks will no doubt be rewarded for his astonishing work here. He has kept our attention for nearly two hours, but what he does at the end is unbelievable. You will probably feel every ounce of emotion as he acts his heart out. Here is a master at work.'Captain Phillips' deserves to be seen, studied, and admired. It showcases the best work by many in an industry that keeps challenging us with disappointments and too many gimmicks. In the end, it's a good source material, a good adaptation, and the best talent all together that prove that there is still room for much wonder in the Silver Screen.",10,1,7,13 October 2013
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Honest and Heartfelt Study of Human Emotions
","What would any story be without conflict? 'Wallflower' is a powerful yet simple story that takes inside the hearts and minds of young people dealing with their own crisis. At the center is Charlie, a shy young man who is dealing with some very dark demons in his past. He has the support of his family, but there are those who can't see beyond a perception of impending doom. Luckily, Charlie meets Patrick and Sam, two other 'misfits' who help him survive his freshman year in school. There is also a sympathetic English teacher who manages to support Charlie through academics.However there is something bothering Charlie, and it threatens to destroy whatever fragile peace Charlie manages to have. The story takes Charlie through a series of ups and downs, exposing him to a culture he has been isolated from. There are some hilarious scenes involving him and the acts of rebelliousness typical of this age group. Yet Charlie's nature is that of a sweet, caring, and somewhat very naive young man. He states it repeatedly that it matters that others feel good. He seems incapable and/or unwilling to see the evil in others. It is at these moments that Sam's and Patrick's friendship saves him from self-destruction.The film has many exhilarating moments celebrating love, youth, hope, and the power of youth. Most of these involve Sam's effervescent and radiating smile. A smile that might be a mask for her own sadness and frustration, but Emma Watson does a wonderful job bringing this marvelous character to life. She shines here in ways that were hinted at in the 'Potter' series. She is radiant.Ezra Miller continues to prove he's going to be around for a very long time, showing the many dimensions of Patrick, a brave soul that must face the fact that it is just too hard for him to achieve happiness, but not because of his lack of trying. It's just the way society has put all these hurdles in front of him, but he has a disarming sense of humor and charm to burn.Unlike 'Silver Linings' and 'The Master', two films that try to hard to show you how good they are, sometimes leaving you in awe of their excellent craftsmanship; 'Wallflower' has a strong beating heart and plenty of soul to relate to all of us. The fact is that the darkness which resides in Charlie's soul is as devastating as that of the main characters in the other films, but this one feels more real and honest. We have no trouble smiling when they are happy and feeling their heartbreak and frustration when things are not going well.This is one of the best films of 2012, like 'Ordinary People' which came out about 30 years ago, it will be hard to forget Charlie and Sam's relationship, and Patrick's never ending willingness to always be there for them. Treat yourself to a good film and see this under-appreciated gem.",10,1,2,27 December 2012
3:10 to Yuma," Fine Thriller, Taut, Tense, Well Acted
","It's always a pleasure to see a good movie, an entertaining movie, with substance, a decent screenplay, and most of all, with real talent, not the over publicized kind, but the one that makes you care about the characters, whether they are good or bad, the ones that go beyond simple expressions and can't be defined as being black and white.Once again, the finest actor of 2007 makes another flawless appearance as the rancher who strives to do something to prove his worth. Christian Bale is the heart of the film, fiery, determined, confused, and a victim of circumstances, who must face an evil mastermind and tries to achieve an impossible goal: delivering the infamous outlaw to the authorities.Russell Crowe is the famous robber who has thus far avoided the authorities and seems destined to continue his winning streak. Through an interesting turn of events, he falls in the hand of a group who might just stop him, but things in the Old West are not that simple, and before the end of the movie, events will become more complex and exciting, as Crowe and Bale have epiphanies of their own and might make some life changing decisions.The ending is one of the most exciting in recent movies, and it's because we have a director who goes back to a formula that is successful. There is a remarkable villain, a world where philosophy exists but it's not at the core of the story, a place that is ruthless and beautiful, a new frontier that can capture and kill you. It's an unforgiving world, and only those who are determined to make it, will survive.The film is expertly directed, gorgeously photographed, and so well-edited that it's hard to take your eyes away from the screen. Here is an example of what films can do, whether they are considered revisionist and overpraised because they try a slightly different approach but fail to capture your interest. '3:10' follows the formula, but improves on it by making it personal and relevant to us, to make us care about what we are seeing, not necessarily about just seeing a matinée idol, but to see some real people dealing with life threatening problems and real situations.Four stars.",9,1,2,16 September 2007
War Dogs," It Spirals Out of Control
","Two childhood friends get together to sell weapons, and time after time they become tangled in situations that defy logic or common sense. The trailer showed what looked like a silly series of situations which could have easily been a mad cap comedy a la 'hangover'. I thought it was just a crazy fabrication that was just going to offer strident, off color and dumb jokes. Mercifully, we end up with a solid film based on real life events that appear incredible when they're introduced, and things become stranger by the minute.The first half of the film introduces the two main characters, one a young man who is a bit lost and can't find a break which will give financial security so he can leave his massage business. The other is a childhood friend who got them both arrested when they were in middle school and has stayed away for a dozen years or so. When he returns, there are signs that there might be a repeat play. Warnings are offered, but the pressure is on, and the pay off looks too good to pass.Somehow the two men manage to come through a suicidal mission to deliver some missions to Iraq. Luck plays a good part in their success, and it leads them to think they might able to raise the stakes next time. Things pick up speed, connections are made, and deals are made. Yet, we know there will be complications when greed and ego raise their ugly faces. People are betrayed, deals go unfinished, and the whole thing goes sour.It'd not be fair to reveal the way the events unfold because it's an important part of the plot. It just seems unbelievable. What carries the film is the way the film is cast. Miles and Jonas are perfect as the mismatched couple, and I wonder if Jonas decided to go all in to give his character a repulsive look which matches the character's personality. He looks unkempt, with a wild look, a couple of days' beard growth, and a very strange laugh, a combination of nervousness and mockery.Bradley Cooper has a dazzling cameo as one of the most wanted criminals on the government's list, showing a new side to his growing list of acting successes. He does a very convincing job as the sneaky, shady man who becomes part of the equation.Go and learn how some business transactions took place, and how sometimes reality beats anything Hollywood could have come up with.",8,0,0,10 September 2016
Skyfall," A Human and Tormented Hero
","There is always guaranteed fun watching a Bond movie, and it's unbelievable that the arguably best Bond film ever shows up during the franchise's 50th anniversary. Daniel Craig makes a superb return to form in 'Skyfall', a film that gives us a deeper understanding of the relationships between 'M' and Bond, and his ties to his past. This makes the film richer and more interesting than it being just a senseless display of special effects and thin scripts. 'Skyfall' certainly is very good movie.In addition to the usual intrigue and spy fare typical of Bond's films, Bond is now confronted with psychological pressure and scars. We see a man traumatized by a close encounter with death, who is testing the loyalties and support of his superior, and is now facing a worthy villain, someone who might understand him much more than he knows.Javier Bardam plays Silva, Bond's nemesis, and he is a pleasure to watch, as he keeps on outmaneuvering the good guys. He understand the machinery, and he is out for blood, compulsive and driven, and this only guarantees that the final third of the film will be deeply satisfying. Be prepared to see how the ghosts of Bond's past mingle with the demons in his present, and the surprising twist at the end.Skyfall soars.",10,9,22,11 November 2012
The Young Victoria," Emily's Royal Turn
","Just when it was easy to assume that a costume drama about royalty couldn't go anywhere, we are given a treat, a moving and intelligent drama anchored by strong and charismatic performances by Emily Blunt, a marvel in the leading role, Paul Bettany, Rupert Friend, Miranda Richardson, and Mark Strong, as the immediate forces that help shape the development of one of England's most powerful monarchs. 'The Young Victoria' dramatizes the tumultuous transition of the young woman into power.Emily plays the queen, with a good combination of raw strength and innocence, someone who recognizes the complexity of the task at hand, but who possesses enough confidence to move forward. She is able to portray Victoria, as an astute young woman who knows she needs support from some key players and must be able to stand up to those who might now have her best interests at hand.Victoria must fend a barrage of intrusions on her way to the crown, and even when she takes command of her new position, she discovers the road to self sufficiency will depend on making some very important decisions and of course, the right support. Luckily for Victoria, there is Albert, a man who appears to like her and is her soul mate. There is amazing chemistry between the two performers, and there's little doubt what the outcome will be, but there is the figure of Bettany's Prime Minister, a man who provides Victoria with some wise support and is also fond of her.Miranda Richardson and Mark Strong shine in supporting roles as two parties who might be of questionable character and exert a considerable amount of power in the upbringing of the young girl. Every one of the supporting characters could use a bit more of development, but what we can see in the screen might be enough to keep us focused on the central character and a superb performance by Blunt, an actress who has shown enough fire and passion in previous performances. In here, she is given the breakout role of her career, a real life historical figure, who broke the rules and managed to rule for a very long time. She shows the seeds of the strength and character the monarch might have needed in her later years. She also has a sweetness and innocence that became the foundation of her charitable work and future intervention in social changes.'The Young Victoria' is not a royal epic portrayal of England's ruling class. It is an intimate story of how human beings grow up and whatever special circumstances surround and shape them. In the end, the movie is a lovely entry in a year that has shown much emphasis on war and destruction. In here, there is a message that good writing and good mediation can take us very far, and there is of course, a good old fashioned love story.",9,1,3,4 January 2010
Raiders of the Lost Ark," It Thrills from beginning to End
","When I first saw it in the early 80's, I was exhilarated because here was a film that was non-stop adventure, went to exotic places, some of which had always been poorly replicated on 40's and 50's studio sets. This time, I think, we were treated to location shooting, with state of the arts special effects, and at the helm, Steven Spielberg, made sure we got enough thrills for a lifetime.Everyone knows how Indiana Jones jumps from adventure to adventure on his quest for the mythical Ark of the Covenant, which is possible a source of unmeasurable, destructive power in the wrong hands. So, Indy searches for different parts of the puzzle from Asia to Africa, and we're eventually treated to a fitting and spectacular display of the Ark's powers.'Raiders' works because of its witty and resourceful script, the great performances by Ford and the rest of the cast, and a creative team that manages to recreate long gone eras with much attention to detail. There's more to praise: John Williams' now legendary score, the snappy editing, and its cinematography.Then there's that scene in the warehouse... 'Raiders' proved that they just don't make them like they used to.",10,0,1,15 September 2012
Deepwater Horizon," The technical overrides the emotions
","Mark Whalberg and Kurt Russell are two of the most likable actors out there, so there should be no reason why we couldn't establish some type of connection with them. At first, we got a little bit of an introduction to the Whalberg's happy family. We really don't know anything about Russell or any of the other workers, except that there seems to be no problem among them. It's not quite the case with some of the touring executives, and there lies the conflict.We are given a light tour of the facilities, somehow going into very simple explanations of what goes on inside the place. For what it must be the longest and most tedious scenes in an 'action movie', we sit through endless discussions relating to technical and managerial issues that might be accurate but are only confusing and tedious to the average viewer. We can't wait for the station to explode so they can stop talking.When the fireworks finally arrive, we given what should have been a grand display of technical effects: visual and audio. There are some good minutes here and there, but it's too dark, the editing is a bit sloppy, and we are hardly able to see who is going through what because I suppose it would have been easy to tell it was a stuntman or stunt woman.I keep thinking back to movies like 'Titanic', 'The Poseidon Adventure', or 'Life of Pi', where careful direction and bit of restraint got us involved, caring a bit for whatever is going on. 'Deepwater' is not the type of movie that requires details to get too complex. We go in to relate to those involved, to care for the heroes, to hiss at the villains, to feel like we're part of the ordeal. The hints are here, but we never go beyond the surface.",4,2,5,2 October 2016
United 93," Very Interesting
","It's not by any means a perfect film. However, it is touching, relevant, and educational, and it provides us with insight about the last hours of a group of people who fought to survive and prevent another disaster on 9/11/2001.Its director does a masterful job for the first half of the film, as we are introduced to the key people of the day. We see how several organizations dealt with the events as they unfolded, and we wonder how some details were overlooked, other pieces didn't fall into place, and once in a while, you feel like yelling out loud: 'what were they thinking?' or 'how could that have happened?'. The fact is that the movie, which at times feel spooky as if someone had been running a video tape on the plane itself is probably too intense for its own good. It tries very hard to portray what might have happened on the plane, and it does it with much intensity. Unfortunately, the personal connection level to anyone on the plane doesn't really exist. We really might never know if there was a leader among the passengers. We understand their desperation and the need to overcome the terrorists, but it is difficult to digest how they overcame their fears and pull together their resources.It is a respectable effort, and it makes you wonder how it will match against the upcoming Oliver Stone effort. Still, it is an important film, and technically it's practically flawless.",8,2,7,30 April 2006
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Spielberg's Best
","Originally titled 'A Boy's Story', it eventually changed its title and made its way to the top of the box office, a critics' darling, and audiences fell in love with the story of a lonely boy who finds his soul mate, has the adventure of a lifetime, and eventually has to say goodbye to the friendly alien from another galaxy.Done with much love and care by Spielberg, with a great score by John Williams that captures the heart, soul, and just about every emotion of the main characters, we get to experience, much like Elliot does, the emotional journey of the stranded alien, as he learns that there is much magic and wonder on this planet.'E.T.' is full of wondrous scenes, some of them depending on flawless editing and Williams' score. The original meeting between Elliot and E.T. is a work of genius, as the young man is faced with deciding whether he's about to embark on an unknown and dangerous enterprise, but there is something magical ready to be discovered, and we join him for the ride.What makes the film interesting is the point of view used to tell the story. For the first half of the story, we rarely see the faces of the adults. It's only the children who convey the transition of E.T., as he discovers the customs of humans, communication, and a love for food. The children realize they've encountered a very special human being, with a spirit of gold and much kindness. This doesn't mean the film drags in anyway. It's full of humor, physical comedy, and great improvisational lines, mostly by Barrymore, in a sensational and memorable debut. She commands the screen with her eyes, her voice, and very dry delivery that reveal, she's both innocent and quite sophisticated for her years.Wallace does lovely work as the mother who must deal with the recent separation from her husband, three growing kids, and the arrival of a new family member. For the longest time, the presentation of her routine reminds us how difficult it is to be a good parent, even with all the best of loving intentions. She sees only so much, and it reminds us in the audience, that it is so easy to lose control, and that we should be more aware of our children's needs. It's not to fault her or anyone. It's just an observation in this fantastic script, one that manages to introduce an alien without sacrificing the humanity in everyone involved. Simple lines like, 'he's got D.N.A.' reminds us that we are not that different.There are powerful moments, and it is impossible to leave the theater with a dry eye, as we get to feel the pain of the separation that Elliot experiences when E.T. gets sick. There is a heartbreaking moment expertly shown by Spielberg, as the kids realize they might have lost E.T. forever, and interestingly, much like 'The Exorcist' shows the worst scenes by giving us a look into some invasive medical procedures, it's devastating to see Gertie's composure shatter when E.T. is being revived by the doctors.There are mirror scenes in the movie, involving a certain group of bicycles, and you had better be prepared to let your spirits soar, as Elliot literally takes flight. It's no surprise that image became a classic reminder of what powerful magical medium movies can be.",10,2,4,1 July 2014
Finding Neverland," marvelous
","I have never been disappointed by anything Johnny Depp ever did. What makes this film really special is how magic it is able to create with its content and its subtle, powerful performances. Julie Christie and an amazing cast help give the story dimensions and ground it reality. Hope the academy members recognizes this fine work and honor it accordingly, especially the work of that young actor who plays Peter. He was truly remarkable. This is a lovely movie that will make you believe with its gentle touches and the use of real emotions, unlike some overdone and over the top work out there where CGI kills human emotions.Beautiful score, gorgeous photography, and outstanding acting... a remarkable work of art.",9,0,0,14 November 2004
If I Stay," Move Over... Chloe has arrived and she is very good
","'If I Stay' is a meditative story of what we do when we have to make the ultimate choice. A teen finds herself revisiting important moments of her life at a crucial time, and by the conclusion of the movie has to decide whether she should which one of her beloved she will follow. Chloe is nothing short of sensational here, giving a very sweet, strong, and sensitive performance as the girl who has lived a very good life but finds herself at odds when she meets the young man who could be her soul mate. There's a lot of love and affection in this movie, and it is very painful to see that there are times in life when pain rears its ugly head, and there's not much we can do about it.Mia (Chloe) is born to a loving pair of free spirits. These two Denny and Kat (Mirelle Enos and Joshua Leonard) are remarkable in their portrayals of two very sweet and loving parents. They show hints of a wild and fun past, but they are able to transition into a mature and nurturing set of individuals who are willing to do everything they can to support their children. It's heartbreaking to see their fate, and we immediately miss them because the characters are probably two of the most wonderful creations of the last decade. It's not that we believe them incredible because we recognize their flaws. It's just that in this film we see their good side, though we recognize they have fears and broken dreams, too, but here the children are the important part of their lives.The film is about choices and growing up. Mia finds herself a bit insecure and can't see herself getting into Julliard. It's obvious to everyone she has the talent and the passion, the fire and the craft is hers, but she's slow to recognize much of what's obvious, and this includes the arrival of the man who might be her perfect partner, Adam, in a great turn by Jamie Blackley. He loves music, he loves life, and most importantly, he loves her.Most of the film is spent in the hospital, as Mia watches everyone's reaction to her family accident. She wavers between staying or going. She hears people express their vote of confidence that she'll be able to pull through, and that it's up to her to decide. She's loved by all the people who come in await the turn of events, and things become more intense as the hours pass by, and while she looks back at her life, we understand that this is not an easy choice. The family she knows is now for the most part gone, but there are others who also have plenty of love and affection for her. It's just that if one knows those parents are not going to be around anymore, faith in surviving dims pretty quickly, and it would take a very special individual to give you hope again. So we keep on hoping, waiting, and trusting that the ultimate decision will be the right one, and that no one will be disappointed.Waiting is painful for all of the parties involved, including us, but we are fortunate to see a great director and some very good actors working on this story. Most impressive is Chloe who can say so much with those expressive eyes of hers. She has already proved herself a physical performer who is not afraid to show the dark side of humans. I can recall her amazing part in 'Kick Ass', and she's the one element in 'Hugo' that kept me from running out of the theater. Indeed, she's grown up in front of her eyes, but this girl has taken on a very difficult role, and she's given us a full performance, an innocent at first who grows in front of our eyes as she experiences life, and she is lucky to have her immediate family provide her with strength, love, and support, only to have her suddenly, face a cruel turning point in her life all by herself. We know she can handle because there's inner strength and intelligence in this young lady. The question is whether she'll play it safe or she'll continue to meet the challenges of her special life.This is an interesting film and demands a second viewing in order to fully appreciate it. I want to go back and see more of the quiet moments. To listen to the dialog and the messages in the superb line up of songs, to see the choreography of those family and neighbors reunions long gone from the movies and very welcome in here. Enos' performance is like watching flowers bloom and the rainbows in full display. She's life herself and her eyes are great conveyors of emotion. We believe Mia and her are fully related. She's the muse that inspires love, confidence, and strength. It's a wonderful piece of acting.We now know that 'Carrie', 'Kick Ass', and her other turns were not flukes, that she's the real thing. I'm glad she's not involved in any of those silly trilogies, that she's moving on to serious film making and will be able to see more of this young actress. Here's someone who can project real emotions without the need of contrived action backgrounds and silly story lines.",9,24,46,24 August 2014
John Wick," Action: Plain and Simple
","This is a welcome surprise. Who would have thought Keanu could play such a cool character with that much conviction? He does a perfect job here, displaying the right attitude and making sure every shot hits its target. It's all very simple. He's a grieving widower, and one arrogant and spoiled jerk comes and messes with him. By doing so, Wick is forced out of retirement because someone has decided to ruin his late wife's legacy.It might look like a silly vendetta to a few, but this is the type of film where there's not much need for emotional speeches and long flashbacks. It's pretty much understood this man is capable of delivering the goods while working, but he appreciated what an alternate lifestyle offered and regrets losing it. Spending a few years in retirement hasn't dulled his skills. As he hunts his prey, we see his exchanges with a few of the people in his previous world, and it's obvious that he occupied a special place there. He commands respect and is well liked/respected. He knows how to follow the rules, express his gratitude to those who help him, and ironically, he is well, a good guy in the middle of this netherworld.After the break-in in Wick's house, it becomes clear, he won't stop until he gets what he wants. In a perfectly cast part, we enjoy every step he takes seeking retribution. Yes, there's plenty of violence, but it's o.k. to see the good guy get even. He's not immortal or invulnerable. He gets pretty beat up a couple of times, but courtesy of a clever script, he manages to pull through, with the help of a couple of friends, and a very interesting deal near the end.It appears all is properly resolved by the end, buy we can only hope there's more of this quiet hero in the future. This has been a good year for this type of characters, and I'm surprised audiences have not quite responded. They're the ones missing on the some of the best thrillers of the year. Just go in, don't think too much, and enjoy.",10,8,22,26 October 2014
Chinatown," A Haunting Masterpiece
","As the film scene takes place, one can almost hear the sound of a heartbreak, as the horn locks in place, and the main protagonist witnesses how fate has unfolded its dark wings. In this film noir gem by Roman Polanski, Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway played so well together, one can't but flinch at the moment its resolution hits us. It's tragic, dark, unforgiving, and yet we can't look away.Robert Towne's flawless script takes us through one eye-opening experience after another. As we wonder whether any of the scenarios in the film were based on reality, or if it's all the work of a creative writer. Every player does his or her part to the best of his ability, doing justice to every line, every nuance, every tentacle that lurks in the midst of the corruption at the heart of the story. There are so many disturbing pieces, and they all fit perfectly. Never before had a detective encountered so much evil in so little time.This film works probably even better after 30 years of its initial release. It was a classic the minute its first screening ended, and a classic it remains.",10,0,3,17 August 2005
Gravity," Mind Blowing and Ground Breaking
","What can one say about Alfredo Cuaron's work quality? He's given us films that are among the best of their kinds. They're full of magic, talent, and wonder no matter what the subject matter might be. Harry Potter became a fully-dimensional character, the girls in 'A Little Princess' brought to life marvelous representations of an era long gone, with humor and insight. 'The Children of Men' showed a bleak future, a time where hope almost disappeared from the face of this planet. It wasn't an empty portrayal in a science fiction half-cooked universe.'Gravity' tops them all and easily positions itself as a movie that could fit very well with the best ever made. In fact, there might not be enough superlatives to describe what you will see there. We have two players, and for the first minutes of the film are only recognizable through their vocal performances, their faces hidden as they are introducing the vastness and beauty of an unforgiving universe. It's grand, magnificent and completely inhospitable. It's a place where humans are one step away from death.Conditions become more and more dangerous as the film progresses, and our two main actors go through ordeals which keep getting more and more difficult to overcome. Before you know it, only one of them will be on the screen, and this where the movie steps up the action, tension, and allows its heart to beat with unrelenting force, never forgetting this work combines love, faith, and intelligence.'Gravity' is full of wonder, from its jaw dropping vistas, its superb photography, its flawless editing and direction, and because of the amazing Mr. Cuaron's admirable dedication: one of the best acting turns of the last 25 years. What you will see Sandra Bullock do in this film requires complete commitment to the material. Her performance is both physical and spiritual. There are moments that are touching and full of qualities one only wished had been present moments of '2001'... a film that it will evoke. It is nevertheless to classify this film as Science Fiction because technically it depicts a situation that is entirely possible in these times.Much credit should go to Clooney's supportive performance, a turn that uses his talents with absolute perfection, most of all because it's a difficult role, one that requires a person with charisma to burn and forces him to reach deep inside his soul in the later scenes. Bullock is just perfect and surprises all of us with her range, giving us a character that is rich with much depth and capable of producing incredible amounts of empathy. She's marvelous.There is only one word to attach to this great movie, and it is unbelievable. It has elements we have heard of before, maybe even seen them in IMAX screens, but what Cuaron has put in the screen is nothing short of breathtaking. You will keep on asking yourself: 'How did they do that?' We might as well be witness to the Best Movie of the Year.",10,3,5,4 October 2013
Lone Survivor," Finally, One That Feels Real
","This one had so much coming against it. It had probably one of the least interesting trailer of the year. In addition, to vastly overrated films had soured the anticipation of seeing anything with a related topic. 'Lone Survivor' is apparently defying expectations, and it earns every little bit of praise, as it is a movie that combines action, suspense, drama, some very moving moments, and takes you to the brink of emotional highs. Everyone in the cast is amazing, but Mark Whalberg, just like Tom Hanks is able to connect both with both his co-stars, the camera, and us.The film follows a group of soldiers who are stranded in the middle of a mission, in very hostile territory. Watching as each of them falls is heartbreaking, with some breathtaking camera work and stunts, we see, hear, and feel every bullet zoom by, every burst of fire, and every bone shatter. Yet, it is not at all a matter of technical wizardry because nothing would work if the camera just rolled and gave some of what has previously been noted as 'realism'. This one gets close enough to see physical and emotional wounds, doesn't shy away from the pain, frustration, fear, and horrors of war. We 'feel' each loss, feel the loss of humanity, the madness that takes over and destroys us.At our screening, we had an audience of men, women, and children who were glued to the screen, forgot their movie treats, the anxiety caused by a movie that promises but bores. At the end, some stood and applauded because we finally got true account that touched us.",10,1,9,12 January 2014
Wind River," Three Out of Three
","'Wind River' is Sheridan's third great movie in a row. He's a man who understand the dark side of nature and can give us both an inner and an outer tale of what the main characters are going through. This time, a dedicated man with a less than perfect life, is recruited to find out what happened to a young woman whose body has been found in the snow. With the supervision or assistance, depending on your point of view, the mystery is slowly resolved, and the findings are grim.It becomes apparent from early on that whatever happened to this young woman has the makings of some type of relationship going wrong; however, as we are told the story, we realize that the backgrounds of the participants in this drama have quite a bit of pain, and their society is slowly imploding because there is a strong likelihood failure or tragedy will strike somehow.We get to see the young woman's family's problem, and how the list of suspects become more intriguing, when we learn more about her brother and his friends. The thrills intensify as our pair of investigators keeps searching for the truth, and it reaches explosive levels when the possible culprits are found.None will ever accuse of this being an unoriginal or boring movie. We might have seen parts of the whole before, but the whole things moves slowly because of the richness of the details, the power of the technical elements who augment the drama. The actors are at their best and both Olsen and Renner can effectively show frustration, despair, and the incredulity of realizing that human nature has the potential of darkness.'Wind River' is Taylor's best so far. It feels a bit more accomplished than his previous two; maybe it's the power of the narrative or the beauty of the setting. What is undeniable is that the whole in indeed a classic.",9,4,6,13 September 2017
Star Trek," Stunning and By all Means, a Relevant Work of Art
","It's midway through the year, and it might not be illogical or inaccurate to start referring to this film, and one of the possible candidates for best production of the year. If we free ourselves from the typical restraints and expectations that such choices have to be a reflection of some attempt to canonize an important individual, a special act by an important social figure, or some misdirected, excuse the pun, portrayal of important themes, and if we are to judge a book by its contents and the outstanding components that make it a special film, we have to recognize that this film is a relevant movie, and that, after capturing our interest and earning our respect, it will be a film that many will look at for inspiration, for analysis, and most of important for giving us what most films nowadays seem to miss, a good movie that is both impressive and entertaining.People go to the movies to be part of a communal experience, to enjoy a satisfying time in the darkened atmosphere of a movie theater, with a movie that has among its elements: a great storyline, very smooth direction, a terrific music score, some of the most exciting special effects in history, and to help achieve almost perfection, some excellent performances that are able to bring freshness to the iconic characters and pay tribute to the essence of a fantastic and visionary universe that has earned the devotion of millions.Throughout its various reincarnations, 'Star Trek' has captured the imagination and respect of many, and looking back at the original series, it is impossible to deny how visionary some of its elements truly are; some of the science fiction might turned out to be very real, as time goes by. Going back to a new beginning might have been a very dangerous move, and coming out successfully is even a more impressive feat.The relationships between humans and vulcans is at the heart of the series, and Zachary Quinto's portrayal of the Spock character is one of the biggest gambles in this film, and the results pay handsomely; as we see an actor who understands the character, exposes himself even more than the original ever did and somehow prepares us for new and more exciting possibilities by keeping the old and fusing it with the possible new adventures, this crew might encounter.In 'Star Trek', a new plot device enables the filmmakers to create an 'alternate' reality, which will open the way to fresh and exciting story lines, still paying tribute and respecting the original sources. As we can see from the remarkable art direction, the ships, uniforms, and the beloved look of the Enterprise remain pretty much intact. Seeing those uniforms in a brand new light was exciting, and looking at the laser guns, seeing the transition into warp from a different angle is a rush that takes a few hours to dispel. Most important is the fact that we have all the relationships still going strong. Though incidents in the new film decimate the numbers of vulcans and Romulans, their interaction survives, and to know that we can revisit the Klingons, and heaven helps us, see Khan again gives you the chills.One big important detail about this new entry is how much fun it is, as it unfolds the new storyline, pays tribute to some of the films that have come before it, and it makes us raise the question, why is it that action, comedy, and adventure are rarely considered outstanding film-making and they are rarely recognized with the awards they deserve. As 'Star Trek', moved at warp speed in front of my eyes, I couldn't help by recognizing the frantic race of Indiana Jones, trying desperately to outrun a more powerful threat, the vast and sterile, yet dangerous icy worlds of 'Empire', the hope and possibility of learning so much, as the ramp allures you into Spock's ship, much like 'E.T.''s own craft tempted and scared us in that film, and there's of course, hangars' resemblance to one important scene in 'Star Wars', the design of Nemo's ship to the threats in 'Alien', and did anyone miss the Tolkien references in Vulcan; mix in the bravado of 'Top Gun' and 'An Officer and a Gentleman', and throw in some truly romantic interludes to see how this can be so appealing and satisfying.This is the third time I am able to experience this amazing film, and I think it demands to be revisited and most importantly, enjoyed, over and over. Let's hope that when it is time to recognize brilliance, originality, and some original approaches, we can put aside our prejudices and see clearly what is in front of us. I shudder to think that in this day and age, Shakespeare and his love for fun, history, and the mystery of human nature would never earn him the golden prize because while he was probably shooting for the stars, he understood that what makes history and human nature remarkable and fascinating is that it all originates in the simple joys and aches of the human heart. Just look at Scott's face every time he looks at his mother in this film. Case closed.",10,1,13,2 June 2009
Fury," Are we furious yet?
","There are some outstanding war films out there, and I wanted so badly to have 'Fury' become another one of them. Two hours later, I felt disappointed that here was this big budget movie that fails to give us a coherent account or depiction of what was supposed to be a couple of days in the middle of hell. First the good: Brad Pitt believes in his character and doesn't fail to embody the spirit of the traumatized leader who has seen his faith and beliefs shaken more than a few times. There's the neophyte (Logan), a young man literally dumped as the action is turning crazier and bloodier. There is the squad of hardcore men who can't seem to find goodness anywhere despite what comes out of their mouths. Le Beouf hangs on the believe some higher being will keep him going, but his eyes are listless. The token minority doesn't seem to have much of a vocabulary or a point of view. Pena is wasted here. There is the soldier who has lost the ability to feel compassion and has become a shell of a being, with nothing resembling a soul in him. Of course, we have a beautifully reenacted scenery full of rotting bodies, wounded and dying men, with fog machines working full time to give it the proper atmosphere. Impeccable visual and special effects and some good make up creations.However, both the screenwriter and the director (who happen to be the same person) appeared to have gone AWOL or have been the victim of a crazy American or German sniper. It really doesn't matter who because it feels like the camera was left running and the actors appear lost most of the time. Nothing really comes together. The dialog is weak at best, there seems to be no rhythm for the flow of the story (which is very thin to say the least), and this is too bad because the expected range of emotions never comes through. Oh yes, there are the required excessive amount of cussing as heads are blown up, imminent danger happens, or hell breaks loose, but it's hard to connect it to anything since it seems the editor has become victim of some kind of chemical agent the troops have been exposed to, but it's not the characters that feel the effects, but the members of the audience, as movie editing goes up in smoke, and we really don't get to appreciate the beautiful horrors of what other films have given us in the past.Here we yearn for the constant fear that Scott conjured in 'Black Hawk Dawn', for the madness of 'Full Metal Jacket', a movie that is both intense and too constricted, but that has some kind of focus. We start wondering where the muses that inspired the battles of 'Private Ryan', 'Braveheart', and even the flawed 'Alexander' have gone. Even less popular films like 'Hamburger Hill' managed to terrify, disgust, and sicken us. There are moments we beg for Stone to step in and give us some of the psychological and physical shadows of death and despair. We want the self-discipline of Eastwood who knows how to make quiet a stifling force, a prelude to even more hellish moments. There is humanity in those films. In here it makes a brief appearance in a scene where people regain a semblance of humanity that is quickly shattered by some members of the heroic fury troop.It's not a complete mess, but a film that needed some more intervention, some more trimming, some more editing to use the elements that give a more complete picture of what the original goal is. We get the drift and cry when the tragic end arrives because we know it's going in that direction, but we also fear that it never gets there because it never feels like we are in the middle of a German field in 1945.",5,7,17,19 October 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Fresh and Revolutionary and Still So Familiar
","It took almost 40 years to take the original diamond and take to what might be its most splendid shape. 'The Empire Strikes Back' ruled as the best of the bunch for over 30 years, and last year hope was regained when we saw 'Episode VIII', only to realize at the end that it was really more of a set up, and one that mirrored the original. For a year, we have been hanging and hoping many of the new plot lines will live up to the very high expectations. Well, it's going to have to be much, much, better than we hope because 'Rogue One' has raised the standard.'Rogue' is a direct prequel to 'Episode IV'; this time the prequel bursts alive with the same force that made believers of all of us the first time. It has a lot to introduce, and it's the sort of mythology that needs to be good enough to stand on its own and prepare us for the immediate sequel. The best thing about it is that it has been produced and designed to look just like the original 1977 film. The weapons, ships, costumes, and the villains are all back, like they never left us. However, technology has made it possible now, with the help of some brilliant editing, a killer soundtrack, and plenty of imagination to give us new perspectives, watching the rebels' ships move and do all kinds of maneuvers that were impossible when Lucas first directed his film. Lucas' original was greatly benefited from the superb editing job his wife did. This time it takes three people to improve on that, and the results are splendid, as three or four story lines are shown to us seamlessly, keeping us on the edge of our seats.'Rogue One' introduces us to the chapter that allows to learn how the Death Star was designed and originated, who made it all possible, and who allowed the rebels to have access to the plans that will eventually lead them to succeed in their enterprise to stop the Empire, at least, temporarily.Keeping us with modern trends and not disappointing us by introducing the skeleton of ideas that fall apart before being fully developed, this film has many new characters, and they're all memorable and not just a whim or an excuse to showcase computer animation, the one problem that sank I, II, and III. This time we feel like we are back where this universe started. We feel welcomed, and we welcome it. One moment that stood out in 'Episode 7' is how cool it was to see Chewie and Solo say that famous line: 'Chewie, we're home!'. The rest of that film moved nicely, but it never hit that high again.On the other hand, we go back home, to recreations of the original sets, with the computer graphics looking the same they did in 1977. It's a fast and exciting trip back in time to the source. Here you see the helmets, the gadgets the same way they were introduced, and the last shot in the film is sure to bring the house down.We follow our new heroes as they track the creator of the Death Star, and they move forward to the location of the material that will prove to be very helpful to the Alliance. As this occurs, we see the levels of intensity reach new highs, and things eventually reach a conclusion that is bound to be both controversial and that lifts this way above what this type of film is generally perceived to be. 'Rogue' is a masterful entry to the series, and one that honors the original material. This film gives us 'hope' that it's still possible to bring new ideas, while using the original source without looking or sounding like a cheap imitation or an excuse to get extra cash from the audiences.New stars will be born, exploding on the screen, and yet you see why this time around it's very important to take advantage of the moment and use what we have to its full potential. The entire cast is a joy to watch, and who can ever refuse a good villain like Vader, a character that if you can believe, grows even more malignant than we thought possible.'Rogue One' is great film.",10,3,14,16 December 2016
Coraline," Wondrous Experience
","I could easily pile up a mountain of superlatives here and say there won't be a better movie this year; it's very early, so there might still be a chance. Whichever the case might be, it's going to be tough to top the levels of creativity, beauty, and talent we see in this masterpiece.With some obvious parallels to the basic storyline in 'Alice in Wonderland', 'Coraline' has some big shoes to fill, and this is done from its very early scenes, as the craftsmanship, modern cinematic advancements in 3-D, and the skillful direction show that we are going to witness a special film. After our mouths close from looking at the gorgeous universe of Coraline's 'boring' world, we are deftly enveloped by the magical script, and the experience continues, as we meet what we believe are the main characters of the story. In reality, nothing is what it appears to be, and since we are identifying with Coraline's frustrations and ennui, we must also channel her reactions and have a taste of what is to come.Very little will prepare you for our introduction to the world that will attempt to seduce our heroine. There were hints of the powerful visuals that superb artists can create with stop motion and thorough knowledge of colors and shapes, but the beauty and composition in the 'parallel universe' is like nothing we have seen before. For a moment, I felt like the 1939 audiences must have felt when Dorothy walked into the wonderful world of Oz. Here is a world where fantasies can come true, wishes become reality, and our lives might never be the same.We will expecting much more from our movies after this superb and sublime film. It is like staring at the muses of the Greeks in the face, seeing how simple shapes and colors, basic concepts such as love, loss, fear and happiness are manipulated to give a fresh twist to stories we have seen before.Much credit should be given to two of the actors in this film who give life to Coraline and her two mothers. Without their flawless interaction, the film would not soar. There is also a lovely score that charms, haunts, and seduces us into believing there is some magic left out there.There is a very simple moral to the story, but its presentation is anything but routine; it's a marvel to behold and to emulate, something that should be treasured forever.",10,0,3,22 March 2009
World War Z," The End of The World
","Brad Pitt, the action hero, saves the world!! or Does he? 'World War Z' is a tense thriller which benefits from a constant sense of doom. We want humanity to save itself from this pestilence, but it looks pretty grim. In fact, the solution might also spell the end for all humans.There are plenty of great scenes here, all the way from intimate moments between Pitt and his family to some moments that can easily qualify as epic disaster takes. There is something incredible about the masses of zombies going on a rampage trying to satisfy their hunger for human flesh. The scenes in Jerusalem are among some of the best in a movie. I wonder how much of it was CGI and how much was real extras. I would like that it was the latter.Pitt is on a crusade to find patient zero and save the world, but this is an almost impossible task, and the obstacles are immense. If the zombies are not stopped, it is over. After an incredible segment involving a desperate attempt to save himself during a flight, he conveniently crashes nearby his goal. The problem is that infection is rampant there, too, and the only way to get to a solution is through risking their own lives. I had flashes of 'Alien' and some of those amazing Scott films where suspense was king, and gore took a backseat. For instance, that's what makes this a special movie. It doesn't disrespect the audience and lets us enjoy the possibilities. The hero might or not survive, and that's just the way things are. David Morse makes an interesting appearance playing a slightly demented character, and he brought back feelings of paranoia and madness which were all over the other movie where Pitt and Morse costarred, '12 Monkeys', and this might foreshadow a rather downbeat ending.It must be recognized that Pitt is a star, a man who wears his mileage with pride and is relatable. We cheer him on because he feels real and human. He is one of us. Will there be a sequel? If the film makers are true to the spirit of the film, this is the end, or is it?",9,3,11,23 June 2013
Passengers," A Few Years to Go
","Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence, a pair made in heaven--two actors with enough chemistry and charm to burn pull this off. 'Passengers' gives us the premise that it's possible to make it through years of solitude or spending the rest of your life with another person without causing body harm to each other, or killing your audience with a trite and boring script. The audience makes it safely to the end of the story, and it's an exciting and imaginative ride.Pratt and Lawrence are the main stars here, carrying 90% of the film. Nevertheless, they get some help from two solid actors Michael Sheen and Lawrence Fishbourne. Their roles are small but key to the main twists. It's always a pleasure to see good actors do good work.Because of unexpected complications, Pratt is awakened from hibernation way too early on his route to the colonization of a new planet. A consequence of this event is that he must now endure 90 years of solitude and will probably die alone on route. Being a flawed human, he reaches the point when he considers ending this problem, but he's charmed by a vision of the perfect mate, and matters become even more complicated as she awakens, too.We need a complication to make the plot more dramatic, and Lawrence soon realizes that there might be more to her hibernation ending. Simultaneously, electrical and computer functions begin to be affected by some unknown failure. It soon becomes clear that the trip might be cut short for all of the people on the ship, and it's up to our heroes to make things right.Much of the action is relegated to the end of the film, and it works. There are some tributes to films like 'Gravity' and '2001', whether intentional or accidental, it doesn't matter. Maybe it shows just how visionary both of those films were. This genre is also benefiting from the more sophisticated special effects that can be added to create new and incredible settings for this type of story.None of this would work without the fine acting by Lawrence. She doesn't disappoint at all, bringing a complex character to life. She's a dreamer, a person who has managed to see herself as successful, who knows she has the skills to do it, but she is also a human being with needs and a past that can now make all the difference. She's resourceful and self-reliant; however she knows when it's time to ask for help, and all of this is beautifully demonstrated in her acting, which demands both emotional and physical dedication.Pratt is growing as an actor and hold his own against Lawrence. As I said before, their chemistry is palpable, and it doesn't hurt that both are very good looking and look amazing running around the ship or getting dressed up for a date.'Passengers' might not change the history of cinema; still it shows there's still room for many new entries in Science Fiction, as long as they are done with care and skill. There's hope for the future.",9,5,9,1 January 2017
The Hunger Games," Amazing and Deeper Than Expected
","Collins wrote, and a very talented of professionals have turned into an experience, a film that combines both spectacle and very piercing social insight about what societies have been, are, and could eventually become.In this oppressive universe, humans have been degraded in more than one way, and every year, as punishment their precious children are subjected to savagery than we can hardly fathom, but in the end it's just a reflection of what society already does, feasting upon the misery of many, and sometimes, it's broadcast in order to appease the despair and negative that otherwise would overcome us if people actually opened their eyes.Our heroine discovers she must fight hard to get to the end in one piece; wondering at various time where she stands, and when she will lose her humanity, her ability to value her and others human life. Others have phrases expressing than hunting a person is no different from hunting an animal, but she refuses to agree with that.Much more effective than her turn in 'Winter's Tale', Jennifer Lawrence is perfect as the young woman who conveys through her expressions and actions what her world has become. With some impressive production design, we are also able to witness and evoke our own reactions to a world where excess is part of the luckier classes' lifestyle.The suspense is sometimes so intense, one can barely hang in there. With some very good editing, we are spared some graphic moments, but these don't lose any of their impact because we still 'see' clearly what is going on. The film works really well as a unit, but the smooth set up and transition is in place for what promises to be a very interesting turn of events in the upcoming two thirds of the trilogy.'Hunger Games' is a magnificent film.",9,2,9,4 April 2012
The Impossible," Best Film of 2012 Without a Doubt
","Based on a true story, 'The Impossible' works at every possible level. Its portrayal of a family in distress after the tsunami devastates the island where they are vacationing is terrifying and moving. The audience will feel the horrors of being in the middle of the natural catastrophe and the heartbreak and pain the characters feel when they face death, the possible loss of a child or partner, and the unbelievable journey trying to find each other.Naomi Watts plays Maria, a mother who is suddenly separated from her husband and two children and must now deal with wounds that threaten her life while trying to provide some emotional support for her oldest child. She gives probably her best performance ever, as we see her dying in front of our eyes, and her eyes convey the helplessness she feels as she begins to realize she might never see her family again. Her spirit is a fighter and she never stops helping others, but it's devastating to see how she is losing her battles in front of our eyes. Thank God for Lucas, her boy, as he keeps giving her hope and now becomes her anchor to life.Ewan McGregor plays her husband, and he's in the midst of despair, not knowing what has happened to the rest of his family. He, like his wife, must now depend on the kindness of strangers. One amazing scene has him on the phone, breaking down, expressing his deepest fears. It's one of the most heartbreaking scenes I have ever seen in the movies.The film doesn't hide any of the emotions in any character. There is pain, horror, desperation, and plenty of kindness and love. In fact, the film wouldn't work if this wasn't the heart of the movie. In the darkest of time, strangers can surprise you. There is Daniel, who appears like a little angel and brings a tear and a smile in the middle of the worst of times. We see parents reuniting with their children, and hope is alive again. People reaching out and proving that life is worth living and one must never give up.Geraldine Chaplin has a small but beautiful scene as she gives comfort to one of the family's children. They look at the stars, using them as metaphors for the beauty and light they give us. They're still with us, even though they might physically be long gone.There are incredible special effects, transporting us to the middle of the disaster, allowing us to understand the horrors of the tragedy. The make up crew does wonderful work, bringing incredible detail to the hell the hospitals were, and much credit should be given to the music, never overpowering the rest of the film but giving it much soul and atmosphere, keeping up with the best ensemble work of the year.Where is that Best Picture trophy? If it goes anywhere else, it's time to stop going to the movies.",10,8,17,28 December 2012
42," Class and Dignity
","Jackie Robinson is a special individual. The first time I read about his story and experiences, I was extremely moved by his courage and talent. It was especially touching when I learned about Pee Wee Reese offered his support, and both taught the world to see beyond ignorance and prejudice. In fact, for such a powerful film, one of the scenes that impacts the most has him on the field, and we see Pee Wee, two members of his family, and Jackie register every possible emotion, from frustration, to shame, to relief in a few minutes. '42' is full of those moments, when powerful source material is treated with respect and care. It is hard not to be moved by the world as seen through the eyes of baseball players and audiences. It is time to face an ugly time in American history, but it's great to see how this leads to more possible hope and understanding.Jackie is trail blazer. He puts his dignity and faith to the test as he confronts the wrath of those who see him as less than deserving of the place he takes in their world. There are some painful scenes to watch as he endures verbal and physical abuse. It's horrible to see supposedly educated people who are there to protect him turn their backs on him, and it is even worse to watch how he can't defend himself because that could set the little progress he has made back. Others come through and offer support, and things end up getting better, but it's sad to witness how one human being humiliates another because of the color of their skin.Mercifully, there are moments of peace and beauty to show us we are not all alone. It is great to see him and his wife love each other, the support of the team's owner, and how little by little his team members learn to accept change. The film doesn't hold back with the corrosive language. It is meant to be there to show us that this really happened, and that racism is harmful and painful.'42' is a classic from the beginning and deserves to be recognized for its many qualities. It's beautifully acted and directed, with great sets, costumes, and the recreation of a period that is not as old as we would like to believe. It's one of the best films of its type, and it teaches a clear and powerful lesson.It's a home run!!",Null,1,2,13 April 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Faster than a speeding... wheel?
","150 minutes? One word of advice for the producers of this series: please invest a few more days and tighten the editing, and you'll have in your hands a classic. Somewhere in between some pretty bloated dialog lies a very good action film. Other than that, we have a worthy sequel to a film that had a few problems establishing the premise behind creating an exciting tale of pirates versus pirate ghosts? I am still not sure.Thankfully, the main cast is back, and Johnny Depp is still a marvelous Captain Sparrow, a unique character whose true nature and motivations remain as murky as the reasons behind his choice of eye makeup. In this segment, our heroes are out looking for a chest that contains a very valuable and essential 'part' that will empower his possessor with absolute power over the Pirates universe. Such is the prize that we everyone literally scrambling to secure the key, the chest, and the object. During the last 45 minutes, the action pieces are integrated so seamlessly, the action and the comedy become one. It is probably the one section of the film that Depp manages not to upstage because every other element in the film, as it should, matches the intensity of his acting.Talking about Depp's reduced time this out is particularly irksome to this member of the audience because it is his pirate creation that lifts this series above other adventures of the fantastic pirate mythology. Depp's sense of humor and ambiguous characterization make the character quite enjoyable and puzzling in an admiring way. It is fun to see a guy who has no problems making the most outrageous deals in order to get what he needs or wants. It is a pity that the producers and the directors didn't think it was important to keep him on screen longer periods of time. Imagine seeing an Indiana Jones movies with 10 minutes of Harrison Ford. We go to 'Pirates' to see Johnny. It is his magnetic star persona that makes the experience quite special.However, it must be recognized that the film is exquisitely photographed and both special effects and real life photography blend quite well. Much work has gone into designing some very impressive make up work for the new batch of bad guys, and the centerpiece of the film has us in awe of an octopus like creature that lives up to what one expects of a horrifying and powerful entity.It is a bit unnerving and mystifying that we end up with a cliffhanger after such a long film, but maybe it is all a set up for a more exciting and better conclusion. After all Johnny will be back, and we know he certainly delivers.",7,1,3,9 July 2006
Star Trek Into Darkness," Just like playing chess!!
","I had the pleasure of seeing this film a couple of times in the last two days. The first time I was dazzled by its action and adventure, along with the wit we expect from this series. All of the crew is back, from Bones with its biting remarks to Kirk's bravado, but the biggest thrill is seeing how well Quinto embodies Spock, and most impressive is the fact that these people are not afraid to show their feelings.Once again, to the detriment of the purists, the directors/producers/writers go back to the original source and put a twist on it, this time with a little darker tone than the last movie, but the fun is there, and they have excelled in their reenactment of the Khan persona. The actor just steals the show every time he is on the screen, and the rest of the crew just have to try harder to match him, and it does happen a few times.Kirk and the crew find themselves in a middle of a challenging mission, as they have to deal with the personal agenda of their leader, a man who might be looking for more than new civilizations, one of a group of super soldiers with more intelligence than Marcus can imagine, and our Enterprise crew must find a way to stop him and save the Federation from impending doom.The film introduces the new Klingons, continue to raise the bar in their execution of the sound and visual effects, particularly, their pristine 3D. The audience should prepare themselves for a fast ride in the middle of a science fiction universe that has always delighted us with their imagination and humor.Be ready to accept the challenge of imagination and enjoy a thrill time at the movies. This is one is fantastic from beginning to end.",10,5,15,19 May 2013
The Notebook," In an intimate epic with a tender heart
","As another proof that some of the recent award recipients have nothing to do with quality, here comes an assured and delicate piece of film-making that will probably not be honoured in the fair manner it deserves in next year's awards' frenzy. Just the other night, I had the pleasured to see an accomplished film for the second time: 'Inside Man', and my jaw dropped when I realized that it was mysteriously absent in any 'best of' celebrations. Regardless of what happens in about one year, audiences should not deny themselves the transcendental experience from seeing a movie that recognizes the beauty inside families and how their relationships are a mixture of inner and external pressures; only to all boil down to one word: Love.As the title indicates, most of the storyline originates from a very peculiar name, and how it seems to affect the main protagonist. As the plot unfolds, we become involved in a sophisticated, almost flawless, and touching, without being maudlin masterpiece. With stunning camera work, a spiritual and moving score, and astounding performances by the entire cast, we learn to identify the universal values that this marvelous film highlights.What is truly miraculous in the film is how its director weaves a story from the incongruities between two cultures that couldn't be any more different from each other, and yet, they are mirror reflections of each other. We all cry, feel happiness and disappointment. As our characters grow and change, we feel their sense of wonder, joy, and grief. Seeing them celebrate breaks down any resistance we might have to whatever foreign quality this movie might be. It's exotic, inviting, showing us that we share more than we think. In 'The Namesake', a Russian name becomes essential to some of the tribulations of a Hindu American young man. It anchors the love that originates between a mother and her children. As Ashima adjusts to her new surroundings, she manages to hold on her traditions, as she learns to cope with the changes that she can't stop. In the end, she delivers one of the most inspirational speeches in movie history, and we can't do nothing but witness a superb dramatic performance come full circle. Many in Hollywood might feel a tinge of envy as her is an actress that charms us in spite of apparently not trying very hard. Her character is lovely, strong, and sometimes reads like a collection of the best moments in every female great role in the last century. She embodies the best of Scarlett O'Hara, the pain and frustration of Sophie in 'Sophie's Choice', some of the regal qualities of Helen Mirren in 'The Queen', and she can even sing and makes us laugh, all when a screenplay that addresses the lives of one regular family in New York.'The Namesake' deserves every single of the kudos people decide to give it. It's a brilliant film, based on an outstanding piece of fiction, and that one that never struggles to be anything else but faithful to its source material, and whose heart never stops beating, with a real and magnificent heart.Run and enjoy some of the best moments of your life.",10,0,1,18 March 2007
The Babadook," Real Madness?
","This is a study on guilty, regret, and fear. A mother must live with the pain of losing a dear member of the family and the possible hate for another. At first, it all appears to be about a very troubled and troublesome child. He embodies everything that we fear our children can become, unstoppable brats who live to cause trouble of every possible kind. This boy doesn't fit anywhere, disliked by just about everyone who he runs into.Then one day a book shows up, and the focus changes. This supernatural and creepy picture book launches an attack on both mother and son. It is all now about protecting each other. From the beginning Essie Davis has done a superb job portraying the stressed mother, and as madness begins to take over, she decays into a crazy woman who might just do about anything she can to stop the impending threat. Unfortunately, madness seems to be winning, and all of her fears are now projected onto her son. This doesn't seem to be heading into any direction but absolute disaster.Ms. Kent gets about everything right. First, we see the pressures brought upon family member by the accident and growing up unable to deal with the loss. Truly, everyone is affected, and the boy is the target because he did after, all, survived that traumatic event. Every shadow is dangerous, every noise a sign that something or someone lurks in the shadows. Is the book real? Has it been imagined? Who created it? The mother is most interesting character because she is after a caregiver who can't or won't do a good job both with her professional care or her own son. Then, she reveals in a key scene that she used to be a writer; therefore, we suspect she can be behind the creation of that book because she has plenty of imagination and the forces that trigger that imagination come from real pain and fears.It is a dark trip all the way to the end, and this has to be one of the strangest, most powerful explorations of guilt and terror in the movies. It makes the mother in 'Carrie' almost benign. This one lashes out physically and verbally and is torn by forces she can't understand or stop.'The Babbadook' is a powerful work because it feels real, based on real forces, and it shows unexplainable moments like the best works of horrors do, but it wouldn't work without a great performance, and that is Ms. Essie Davis, an actress who is capable of giving us whatever is needed to understand what the character feels, needs, or most importantly, in this case, fears.",9,3,10,21 December 2014
Madagascar," It's a disaster
","Here is a cartoon with no charm, no well-developed ideas, with no chemistry among its main characters. It's a pity since everyone is trying so hard. It would have been a 'O' but that wasn't possible. The backgrounds were nice...What appeared as one of the most delightful previews in history somehow turned into a myriad of horrific set pieces that felt forced and in sore need of some adept direction. For starters, the 'dialogue' between different characters appeared to be a pastiche of solo routines from each of the characters. Only Jada Pinkett Smith had a smidge of personality as she tried to fix the misunderstandings between the two main characters. Thank God for the psychotic penguins whose characterization relied more on visuals than the atrocious dialogue given to the other members of these mess.While I waited for this film to end, I couldn't help looking at the rest of the audience (70% of which were children), and noticed they look equally displeased and disappointed. Hollywood, it's time to take more time developing a good screenplay than wasting huge amounts of dollars on the use of celebrities. How about using real talent next time?",1,35,68,29 May 2005
The Danish Girl," Redmayne and Vikander Barely Keep it Alive
","'The Danish Girl' is a beautiful package that came with plenty of anticipation. It is the story of a pioneer, an opportunity to showcase the talents of two talented performers, and had it been in the hands of a more capable team, it would have reached heights that very special films are able to attain.There's nothing wrong with the performances of the leads. In fact, Redmayne might be even better than in his Oscar winning turn last year. Vikander continues to show she's an acting powerhouse. Her range is incredible, and she handles the drama and complexity of her role the way more experienced actors could. She and Redmayne work very well together, and it's a pity that even with all the other members of the team, the director has managed to give us a film that is even more frustrating than 'The King's Speech'. That film benefited from Firth and Carter's chemistry. This time, the themes are darker and more controversial, but they have been stiffled by the way an otherwise gorgeous score is constantly blaring and drowning the emotional life of the performances. Scene after scene we are 'cued' to feel wonder, pity, sympathy, or whatever emotion the musical score is supposed to signal. It's a pity because if the music had not been there, the film would be very powerful.Yet,it's not the only problem. The script seems scattered. Had it followed a more streamlined and straightforward path, it would have been better appreciated. Instead, the production relies too much on the gorgeous photography, the exquisite outfits, the sensitivity of the class these people belong to. Are they bohemians? Are they artists? Are they really talented? They are supposed to be free-spirits, but they certainly struggle with the different possibilities they encounter.Redmayne conveys the torture and confusion nature has presented him with. He knows what he feels. Hopper makes sure we see him caressing the fine fabrics, but he remains sensitive and rarely achieves femininity the way those three actors were able to project in the farce 'Wong Foo'. Redmayne is way too classy. Still, his eyes can show pain, fear, and anxiety, and that certainly helps the film. One asset and a problem is his mate. She's powerful, expressive, can deliver lines with certainty and emotions. She shows loyalty, affection, love, lust, and confusion and matches Redmayne in just about every frame. Vikander steals the show.There's much that is important here, and its power is lessened by the lack of confidence on the subject matter, and because we are constantly distracted by the aesthetics, forgetting what really matters is the bond, the souls, the hearts...I missed the rawness of dialogue like McLaine's in 'Terms'. Life is not exquisite, is flawed, is full of pain and that makes the special moments precious. This is a showcase for performers of all types, but there is hardly any unity. It's that isolated masterpiece in the museum that we are supposed to admire, but we can hardly gather any true liking for it.",5,33,60,23 December 2015
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Quite an enjoyable adventure
","There are several aspects of this film that I found to be very enjoyable: Its terrific animation, the delightful vocal performances of all the actors involved, and its irresistible imaginative charm. John Leguizamo shines as the heart of the movie, the sloth that inspires all of us to have a good time and gives us hope that there is still some imagination left in Hollywood. His creation and very talented vocal turn perfectly interacts with the other actors' styles. Romano's deadpan delivery this time has found the heart that it sorely missed last time, when it was a just boring attempt to leave his character with no personality. Romano has now found the essence of Manny and has some fun with it. He compliments Queen Latifah's lovely and goofy Ellie. Leary's Diego is not the showiest turn, but he also has some great moments.In addition to the principals, the possums and the mini sloths are welcome arrivals, and there are some wonderful moments of nutty entertainment, as now computers can portray some truly wacky moments, such as the Berkeley-inspired moment in the sacrificial fire pit and the vulture 'food' numbers.This film is a throwback to what made classics such as 'The Little Mermaid' and 'Beauty and The Beast' work: solid acting and a good writing base. It's a commendable and admirable effort.",9,55,80,1 April 2006
The Secret in Their Eyes," True Love?
","Oh, there are questions all right? Plenty of questions about what really happened? There will be answers, too, and they will be satisfying and maybe, even huge revelations to fit this epic drama, where people express themselves openly, and yet their own emotions take backstage to the drama of others, just like we forget we're watching a film and surrender ourselves to its hypnotic and bewitching power.Set in a bureaucratic world where who you know will open doors and determine the safety of your future, a couple is in the middle of a drama which originates when a young and beautiful woman is brutally murdered. As the investigation proceeds, emotions grow, and in a perfect, isolated world, things would turn out easier. What develops is a messy situation where everyone becomes more and more frustrated because this world after all, is not forgiving or perfect, and sometimes justice is nothing else but a name or a word with not really weight.As the onion layers are peeled, and we know more and more about what really happened in the drama that spans for 25 years, we discover that love is such a powerful force that it refuses to die, but it's not infallible and it's pretty confusing. There are after all, social classes, political mazes, and personal vendettas to block the road for our hero and heroine. There are also many fantastic pieces of dialog, and some very realistic recreations of what working in a government entity is like. As one of the main characters states: 'It's my life, live yours.' It's easy to be overwhelmed by the drama of others, especially if we get too close to the source of the mess.This film deservedly won many accolades, and in one of those rare moments, was fairly recognized with the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. Its two closest contenders would have made the Top 10 Best Picture list a better indicator of films with better craftsmanship, storytelling, and the true magic of a great film. I had a tough time choosing between 'The White Ribbon' and 'The Prophet'. They're great films; yet there is something powerful and very touching at the heart of this movie, something that connects with our human needs, and that elevates the film a bit higher than the other films. One will gasp at the end of the final scene, one that summarizes the message of 'The Secret of Their Eyes', an appropriate title if I ever saw one.This film is not perfect; its length is a bit of a problem, but it's got epic feelings, classic moments, and a very satisfying conclusion, a moment that cinephiles around the world will recognize and embrace. Maybe because they don't make them like these anymore, certainly American studios don't put them out as much anymore...",9,6,10,25 April 2010
Black Book," Really Amazing Movie!!!
","Carice Van Houten comes in with a performance that will leave a mark this and any other year. Her work in 'Black Book' succeeds because this actress is capable of conveying a variety of emotions that range from tenderness to incredulity, anger to immense sadness. Her heroine in 'Black Book' is not a character that grows because of the special circumstances that she must confront, but she a resourceful survivor who must do what is necessary to help herself and others. She is also incredibly lucky.Rachel lived in Holland and from early on we learn she is willing to do what is necessary to achieve her goals. If this means becoming a spy and infiltrating the very core of the Gestapo, she does it. Amazingly, she encounters a kindred soul in the middle of this hell, and she eventually learns that the lines of good and evil blur at some point.The film's production is impeccable, and it moves very well, considering how much is packed in its nearly 2:30 hours. It's got a circular structure, and although we know its resolution, we can't help being drawn by its thrilling narrative and very charismatic star. The rest of the cast supports Ms. Houten very well, each one playing his/her respective part with conviction.When I saw the film, I was particularly impressed by the fact that it never lags, the way most American films do nowadays. Its structure is very simple and straightforward, but it weaves the themes of horror, bravery, and survival into a very exciting movie. The assured direction of Mr. Verhoeven succeeds because he seems to understand and respect his sources. This time, he leaves out some of the reverence that bogs down many of these period films. This time we are shown a side of WWII that rarely makes it to the screen: the underground fighters that risked their lives to lessen the impact of the evil forces in Europe.Overall, the film will touch you and teach you how we should learn from the past, look at ourselves and see how life is more complex than just black and white.",10,7,9,25 March 2007
127 Hours," Only 127?
","I went to see this film because I admire Boyle's work, and after 'Slumdog' the expectations were high. When you team Franco and Boyle's talents, the results are bound to be interesting, and they are for the most part.Based on the real life story of a hiker whose arm gets trapped during one of his weekend hikes, the film delivers some strong moments, and these work mostly because of Franco's intensity. His sense of despair, anger, frustration, and anger drive the film while the director concentrates on the drama. Unlike Ang Lee and Peter Jackson who can somehow conjure magic to supplement the drama, the triple screen doesn't do much but distract from the central conflict here.On the other hand, Franco's desperate attempts at trying to find use of his resources is interesting and imaginative, and there is a scene involving a sudden flash flood that makes the audience care whether this man will ever make it out of this terrible situation. Very little time is given to the real background of Roston, and too much is spent in the 'delirium' scenes. It's not that I am in disagreement with the sense that the hiker would have 'gone mad' with desperation, but at times this device becomes repetitive. We see little about what the family was going through during his disappearance.It's not a bad movie, not as exciting as I expected it to be.",7,2,7,11 November 2010
Creed," Rocky's Golden Years
","Who would have thought seven sequels and nearly forty years after the original, we would have a film that rocks as much as the original? What is truly amazing is how much fun, how uplifting, and how good 'Creed' is. We have Michael B. Jordan proving that he wasn't a one-hit wonder in 'Fruitvale Station', and he makes quite a comeback from the much maligned 'Fantastic 4' to a fabulous tribute to 'Rocky', which is an overall winning project, with the support of its original star, in a performance that might take him back his bookend Academy Award.'Creed' brings Rocky and his protégé, Adonis Creed to a climatic fight in London, putting together a series of events that gives us background on who these people are, where they come from, and what a special relationship they have. It's a rocky road for all of the people involved, as the young Creed is fighting emotional trauma, as he is trying to discover who he really is, but he has problems with the ghosts of his past. We have Rocky, who has now settled down as a widower and runs a restaurant, trying to live in almost complete isolation from his past.There are many touching moments in the film, and most of them involve Stallone who shows incredible range here, as a man who carries with him a legacy, is now in the last years of his life and who misses the best things in his life, as both members of his family have gone away. There are plenty of references to the original inspiration for this film, but it doesn't dwell on it. There is a new star here, as Apollo finds his footing, develops new relationships and evolves into a new boxing star.Many of the fighters have a problem, involving short tempers, and this has proved to be the downfall of many, not being able to discipline themselves by focusing entirely on the task ahead. This is where Rocky shines, as the voice of experience, giving Adonis tips and sage advice. It is both professional and personal, and it rings with much sincerity, never becoming a maudlin joke.The film is full of exciting set pieces, and no one is going to be disappointing by the spectacular boxing match in the end, which is a work of art that shows the potential dangers of the spot, the beauty of film editing and that proves one can demonstrate how complex the sport is, without resorting to fancy camera work and excessive use of foul language. Here the kids are not hoods and not everyone gives in to violence. People have difficult problems to overcome, and it's not certain if they will always succeed, but it shows the determination of the human spirit, and it surely delivers a true winner and a wonderful crowd pleaser.",10,2,6,29 November 2015
Orphan," Chilling Tale of Obsession
","This was an unexpected surprise, a tale of suspense and horror, built around one of the most malevolent villains to come out of cinema in the last 75 years. For a moment, I kept thinking that if the bad guy here went up against the demon of 'The Exorcist' or good old Jason or Freddy, those guys wouldn't stand a chance against this villain. Evil apparently lurks in the most unexpected places, and it is behind one interesting facade here.As the story unfolds, we discover that Esther is full of surprises and that there is very little she is not willing to do to prove a point or protect herself. As those actions become more intense and we cringe as we wait for the next deathly action to take place, we also marvel at the complexity of the story, for this is no ordinary horror thriller. It builds upon the demons that have been haunting a family for the last few years.Beautifully photographed and scored, and directed with strong confidence, the film never stops surprising you and doesn't let you go until the very last minute. The most impressive factor is the acting of all the principals involved, for this is not a movie that relies solely in special effects, a loud soundtrack, or quick cuts to create an oppressive atmosphere where evil thrives.It is somewhat original, hypnotic, and perfectly able to show the various degrees and faces of violence and hatred, throw in a twist of psychosis and one of the scariest characters since Hannibal Lectoer, and we almost wish there was a sequel in the works. A classic is born.",10,8,13,30 August 2009
About Time," Smart, Entertaining, Funny, and Touching
","Richard Curtis understands romance! It's been almost two decades since he wrote his masterpiece: 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', a loving examination of how quirky looking for happiness could be, yet it was old fashioned, real, and very good. He goes behind the camera this time with his own script. This only means another winner.There are some liberties taken with the concept of time in the movie, but it's interesting to see how through Tim, we are able to live our fantasies: the opportunity to have a second chance and being able to correct a few of our mistakes.The most winning part of the project is the casting, with every single performer giving winning performances. The most loving portrayal comes from McAdams, glowing, sweet, and lovely, with one of the most fantastic smiles I have seen in a recent film. Watching her react to Tim's initial moves is a joy, and her wedding scene is a romantic classic.The film, like 'Weddings' manages to feel real and balance moments of happiness with a few incident of grief. The best is to see the realization that these people act like real people and are representing our dreams, giving us an opportunity to at least experience some of their joy.Enjoy!",9,4,8,8 November 2013
Spotlight," What's Wrong With This Picture?
","'Spotlight' is based on one the biggest scandals that has rocked the Catholic church, and just about anything which affects religion and its consequences, is the stuff that fuels the best dramas and performances. Mix children, cover ups, legal maneuvers, with some of the best working today, and you should have a winner, but 'Spotlight' is a long way from achieving its goal.Michael Keaton is a hundred times better than he was in 'Birdman', where he looked like has no direction at all. Here he's a conflicted soul who must weigh his working ethics against his personal faith. He, along with his team become part of an investigation that reveals darker truths that they imagine or want to hear. We see stereotype after type make appearances: the eager reporter, the centered editor, the professional lawyer, the loyal follower, the reporter with the big heart, etc. The entire bunch of elements are there, but there is something that throws the whole film out of balance for no matter how horrendous every discovery is, we remain numb, and this is not the result of our shock. It's just the inability of the film makers to connect to either th material or provide that connection to us. Scorcese's film about Christ's alternate life was one of the most controversial ever, only to culminate in one of the most faith reaffirming moments in cinema. 'All The President's Men' remains the finest example of newspaper reporting cinema, engaging us with fine performances, a magnificent script, and some of the exciting directing choices for this type of film. That world is dark and threatening, and no matter how many times we see it, we are full participants in the reporters' quest. Redford's and Hoffman's turns are classic. Here, the actors try really hard to save the day, but they have limited material to work with. It's not the nature of the controversy, but the poor adaptation that ends up feeling like we're watching a poorly edited documentary that says a lot but forgets the hideous nature of the problem. We have statistics thrown at us every five minutes, and we are given the token shocking lines and scenes, but with a couple of exceptions they feel empty, hollow.Ruffalo is wasted, McAdams was way more interesting in 'Morning Glory' where she was allowed to open her soul. Here she reads her lines, stands where the marks are, but one can sense a little frustration as it's clear she's trying to hard. Keaton is the only one who is able to come up with a semblance of pain and conflict, and Liev is one character that because of his role manages to ring true since he's not given the opportunity to be smothered by bad script.If you want to feel the emotional power of the story, read the novel where we get closer and deeper in the hell that these incidents were. I was wondering why that annoying and overbearing score kept intruding, and in one of the few moments of quiet, it stops, giving the film more power by its mere absence, only to be ruined a chorus of snoring patrons behind me that had already succumbed to this overlong and uninvolving piece of film.",5,19,39,26 November 2015
500 Days of Summer," Coincidence, Fate, and Music
","It's the story of a couple who appears predestined to have the best of everything, presented in one of the most challenging ways possible, with a terrific selection of pop tunes, and two of the most appealing actors out there. In the end, a very enjoyable film, with more to it than it seems.We have seen several of this type of movie come out in the last few years, exploring the relationship between adolescents/young adults. Some have cleverly integrated humor, some exciting tunes, and a couple of clever twists to the same old story. Here, we are given plenty of charm, through its two amazing leads, combining good, realistic dialog, with tributes to the old films, where falling in love was enough to set off fireworks, spontaneous dancing, and well, at times, some slapstick. Also, there are tributes to some of the most 'romantic' films out there, where people sit on benches at stare at the newly found beauty of their surroundings while in their romantic bliss. Yet, there are also warnings about the whole, silly thing along the way.There is pain and joy, love and hate, disappointment, bitterness, cynicism, and plenty of emotions going around in this film. There is enough to give even the smallest speaking part a great line. It is a terrific little movie that move us and makes us think, that can awaken in us some of the reactions that turned some films into classics. This is the type of movie that has been adapted to contemporary times to make it fresh, and yet it retains enough of the classic ingredients to show us how some stars are born, and what real chemistry feels like.This is a film that caters to an audience with intelligence, with the ability to decide and choose, who can truly appreciate interesting cinema. There have been some very good films before, and for some reason John Cusack keeps popping in my head. Gordon-Levitt gives us a little more vulnerability and there less cynicism in his approach, and there is his counterpart, the dazzling Zooey Deschanel, with those amazing eyes that can speak volumes in one look.Enjoyable, touching, and quite an interesting film.",9,1,3,30 August 2009
Juno," Something that we love for what it is
","This excellent film pulls off a trick that is harder to master in Hollywood than most people think, an original tale with enough bite to support its creative edge and plenty of heart to connect with even the most jaded in the audience. Most of its success comes from the lively turn by Elaine Page, a performer who can tackle a role better than 99% of her more famous contemporaries. She understand the dark side of comedy and how drama and comedy are, well, two sides of the same coin.In this delicious film, a pregnant teenager discovers that life can surprise all the time. She learns as her pregnancy becomes more and more evident how good her support system is, and her learning comes from observing the reactions of those people she is now interacting with. It might be her hypersensitivity, probably due to hormonal changes in her body, or it might just be that she is now forced to deal with issues in a more mature manner. Whatever the case might be, Juno learns to appreciate the best qualities in people, the diamond in the rough that she is, and she discovers that wisdom can only be achieved by careful application of her unexpected learning.Michael Cera and Jennifer Garner stand out in their supporting roles, but it's only fair to say that no one in this movie is not doing very good work. It is an ensemble piece, with plenty of heart and a sense of discover in material that we all thought we understood. These are complex issues and the resolutions are never by the numbers. Juno understand her uniqueness and has enough understanding of how far respect can go.2007 has indeed been a good year for movies, and it should be stated that great comedies don't come by so often. Enjoy.",10,3,13,14 January 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," This one is a MAZE!
","Before I say anything else, everyone here is very likable, even those people who seem to have walked in from central casting as props or decoration. The main players are back, each competing with each other for time and attention, probably a bit more selfish, this time out. Johnny Depp plays or appears confused as to how much money he seems to be making in this 'sequel'. There are some very impressive special effects, way too many of them this time out, and though I would like to enjoy each and everyone of them, I think I would probably not want to sit through this very lengthy and not very exciting film.First of all, the resolution of the cliffhanger is dealt with shabbily, as we see our friends on their way to Jack's rescue. Unfortunately, along the way, with a get a bit of existentialism, double talk, and plenty of confusing story lines that become more and more tangled along the way, as those never ending conversations are interrupted over and over by some semi exciting special effects.Once in a while, there is hint of what made the first film so enjoyable, as Deep's Jack is back with a flash of his personality. Fleshing out the other characters appear to have been problematic for the 'writers' of this entry as they give each character a chance to explore part of their personalities we have never seen before. There is no subtlety here, no opportunity to show how good of an actor anyone can be. Knightley suddenly changes into a 'leader', Bloom shows his dark side, Rush, well, continues to mystify us, and the other characters continue to be window dressing.Moral of the story: More money means more revelations, more time, more noise, more of almost everything, except a good story.

Spider-Man 3," But, would you like to see it again?
","'Spiderman 3' suffers from excessiveness... There is too much drama, too much background references, too much self-importance, too many indulgences, and rarely enough, not enough action or innovative special effects to make us care for what is special about this character and the new villains.Enter Topher Grace, James Franco (well, re-enter), and Thomas Haden Church, and you have some very competent performers. Unfortunately, their time is shortened because we have a rather uninteresting drama unfolding between the main characters, a development that drags the rest of the film down, as we plod through scenes that we know can lead to nothing else but a happy outcome. There is no way the filmmakers are going to split M.J. and Peter, so why waste our time with story lines that are dead to begin with? Back to the villains, Sandman is probably the most interesting of the three, and he would be a terrific presence if he was a bit meaner... more diabolical, and less of a victim, himself. Then there is Mr. Grace, a man who shows promise, but looks like he belongs on the side of the good guys. His transformation into the horrifying Venom is semi effective, as we know what is behind the 'suit'.There are problems with the direction because there is no sense of danger, impending violence, or anything remotely destructive. The only danger is to the audience's attention, who might be able to take a nap and not miss much in the first third of film.When I walked out of the theatre, I felt like a had a nice light snack, but I wondered if that would be equally satisfying again...",6,2,4,6 May 2007
Match Point," Insightful, Intelligent, and What a Thrill (Especially the Ending)
","When Woody Allen is in top shape, the man knows no fear. In 'Match Point' he treats us to a tale that is supposed to teach us something by exploring the illicit adventures of a not so bright but lucky chap. He just happens to always be at the right place at the right time, and in most cases, he succeeds in spite of that force of nature played by Scarlet Johanson.In fact, part of the fun, is watching his journey through a mine field he creates himself. He knows what is best, and yet he surrenders himself to passions he understands but has little moral fiber to fight. This film takes to England and explores how the upper classes live, how they interact, and what they offer to people who get lucky to interact with them. Woody Allen subtly offers an insight into how breeding affects your social maneuvers. For example, he does wonders with the cast, and that's what makes Johanson's Nora so interesting and dangerous. She recalls Glenn Close's Alex in 'Fatal Attraction'. Is she a character that is too emotional for her own good? or Is she a victim of circumstances beyond her control? or Is she the victimizer? There is a very strong performance here, and it should come with a warning for this actress brings intense carnality to the screen. She is an object of desire, and she plays it to the limit.Rhys-Meyers gives a solid performance as the man who is able to move up in the world, with the approval and support of his newly found benefactors and a devoted wife. Along with Johanson, they keep the film going, and their interaction perfectly supports the tightness of Allen's script. It's through their history that we learn our lesson, and that lesson should be a point of contention between many members of the audience. It's a solid film, with much intelligence, much entertainment, and a return to greatness for a man who has explored the complexity of the human soul before, and who knows what weak creatures we are.",9,8,12,2 January 2006
Midnight in Paris," Allen's Dreams are Magical
","There's something about the midnight hour, something special, mystical, and magical. In the case of this marvelous movie, its impact is fully realized, as we see our protagonist suddenly realize that he has the opportunity to face that which he truly admires, treasures, and dreams about. In the opening scenes, he expresses his desire to settle in the city of lights, and we know it's not going to be an easy thing to do. His girlfriend and he are quite different in their appreciation of what being in Paris means. She understands it's special, maybe from an aristocrat's point of view. He might be looking at it, as the dream place for an artist to find aspiration to fulfill his artistic goals.One night, he wanders into the streets of Paris and finds himself lost, only to find himself rescue by a party of night socialites who turn out to be quite famous in some literary circles. Soon, the screenwriter/aspiring writer has an opportunity to see himself living one of his dreams as well as slowly come to some surprising epiphanies as he discovers more and more who his new acquaintances might truly be, and most important what their dreams really are.The film is set in several time periods, and Paris glows intensely and seductively in everyone of those. From its overcast skies and reflective streets, showing lovely architectural details and its magnificent landmarks to the superb and lovely recreations of older time periods, one can't help being seduced, charmed, and inspired to find a way to show what a special place, and consequently what a truly magical film this might be.Performances are outstanding all around, with Cotillard once again stealing every second she is on the screen. Through her eyes and carefully delivered lines, we understand what attracts us to this special time and place. She is a gorgeous and very talented performer, one who might be truly aware of her standing, yet she doesn't dwell on it. She attracts many types, but her philosophy is unique, move on, enjoy, live the moment. In a way, she is like the city that has inspired Allen, and many others before him. Paris as a place might not be aware of its magnetism, its beauty, and its power. Cotillard's muse is the perfect human equivalent, a dazzling and potent woman, who moves from man to man, place to place, time to time, and who surprises us with her own wishes near the end of the story.Wilson inhabits the Allen persona, and he does a very good job, not creating a tired imitation, an annoying cliché that could have ruined the perfect balance of sight, sounds, and insightful dialog, keeping this masterpiece way ahead of the best Allen has offered before. For those of us who gasped during the fantasy sequences of 'The Purple Rose of Cairo', the marvelous recreations of the stage in 'Bullets Over Broadway', the dissection of relationships in many of his best films, get ready to see it all finally come together, as he picks from the best, and adds his personal touch, with many a funny and clever observation, uttered by Wilson with a honest and complete sense of wonder. Unlike many of his leading men, Wilson displays an innocence which allows him and us to see his adventures in a fresh light.'Midnight in Paris' is a beautiful display of what movie magic can truly create, a sense of wonder long gone from contemporary cinema; This is a movie that entertains, teaches, and wears each one of its elements, like Paris bewitches us with every light, every facade, and every heartbeat of its music.",10,365,450,30 May 2011
Zodiac," What a crime!
","Sometimes it's not the end result that is thrilling, but the road there, and through the skillful eye of David Fincher, the investigation of the Zodiac murders is indeed a very twisted and challenging one. Through the obsessive perspective of our main character, the only way to solve this mystery is to dive in, without any concern for personal safety.Little by little, he discovers that there are too many loose ends, and that inexplicably, the police officers are not able to pin down the main suspect. By the end of the film, we still don't quite understand what happened. There is enough tension to expose a few people to danger, particularly our cartoonist/investigator, and to realize that there is more than one party to blame.The film is intriguing because it is an expose of an investigation that didn't work and led to a series of murders that could have been prevented. It is also fascinating because it shows how police departments and newspapers ethics worked in a not so distant era. There are many implications that are touched upon but not developed, and much of the appeal of the film is that it takes us back to Hollywood's golden age in the 70's, a time when directors took their times developing a character, creating an atmosphere, and presenting terrific acting. The cast is excellent, with Raffalo, Gyllenthal, and Soveigny doing superb work, and Downey, Jr. once again shining, with his portrayal of another lost soul.It is hard not to go back and look at the production here, and I certainly hope that the careful work by the entire team is recognized later in the year. This film is remarkable because it proves that anything done with care will result in a quality production. A lot of care went into the cinematography, art direction, costume design, and music score, to bring back an era, and to be as truthful as possible to its source material.Last, but not in anyway least important, is the storyline of this series of murders that terrified a nation, and how smoothly it blends with our contemporary fascination with unnecessary violence in films. The film pulls this off because it has simmered slowly to the point that we really care about what happens to the protagonists. It never relies on cheap jolts and unnecessary bloodshed, but the effect is still a bit voyeuristic, except that this time we really 'know' how we got to this point. There are a couple of scenes that recall moments in 'Silence of the Lambs', when the sense of doom becomes oppressive and we can't help wondering if it was all for nothing. We all want a happy ending, and this time, in a very ironic way, we got a real one that leaves with a satisfied look in our faces.",10,1,5,4 March 2007
Milk," It's a Golden Moment for all Involved
","Seldom Hollywood gets it this right, from the assured direction of Van Sant to the excellent work done by the perfectly cast actors. Overall there is a sense of reality that heightens the pain and seriousness of the situation, a painful reminder of human perspectives and how easily we tend to overlook what is best for us and take sides in order to please segments of the population.It's the story of a man who believed in making a difference and thought he would never be able to leave a mark. Throughout the film, Penn makes sure that the vulnerability, insecurity, and steely determination are flawlessly portrayed. He never creates a hero or a superman, he recreates the multifaceted individual who happened to become a crucial part of a movement that needed to be heard and ensured the rights of many people wouldn't be trampled.Many might become upset by the main subject matter, but it is important to show the various sides of the protagonist and one could hope they could go more in depth into who Dan White was, and most importantly what made him tick and eventually explode.The film is rich and filmed with a sense of realism that evokes the cinema of the 70's. It feels importantly because it deals with serious subject matter, treats it with respect, and seems to have a feeling of objectivity, giving it a very real and grave tone.It is perfectly anchored by some of the best work ever done by Penn, Hirsch, Franco, Luna, and Brolin, actors who have been doing outstanding work in the last few years, but somehow manage to reach even more impressive levels here. It's golden all around.",10,13,26,29 November 2008
The Prestige," Wild, Intelligent, Challenging, and Entertaining
","Nolan does it again. He creates a cerebral, mysterious, and very entertaining thriller that is original and keeps his audience interested for two hours, without talking down to its audience or passing tired remakes as something worth their time. Here is a film based on literature, on vibrant and original characters, with actors who can show others what is like to inhabit their roles and do their best every time they on screen. Both Bale and Jackman are at the top of their game, complementing what the other does in order to put on quite a show, pretty much like the protagonists in the story, they appear to be outdoing each other, but in reality they are just both doing work that enhances and makes the entire film a joy to watch.Without revealing many of the exciting surprises in the film, it is possible to give a brief summary of what works: an amazing script by Nolan his brother that gives rivalry a new twisted perspective. Here is a couple of men obsessed with fame and the new challenging, out to outdo each other and to avenge some perceived wrongs. As the film unwinds or winds tighter (depending on how you perceive its development), one follows each of the two 'magicians' as they try to discover each other secrets, unlocking them and finding revelations that might not be too palatable as they reveal much more of their true nature.What the film carries beyond the charming 'Illusionist' is the furious dedication and obsession that lies in the heart of every true 'professional'. Bale is a natural and knows how to create and develop an illusion, and illusion is the key word here. The more theatrical performer, portrayed by Jackman, is willing to integrate technology and to learn from his mistakes. What hampers his progress is the constant and dangerous competition by Bale's Borden.The film never cheats his audience. In fact, it gives us all the answers, and then it ups the level of curiosity by taking us along a ride that resembles a maze, and where nothing is what it seems. It is a challenging film to watch, and the only regret is watching its conclusion, not because it's a letdown, but because it means the ride is over, or is it?",10,2,4,22 October 2006
Cloverfield," Shaking all over
","First of all, get over the shaky camera work. What is it supposed to be like when you're running for your life and/or being attacked by some pretty nasty and messy monsters? Our camera man does more than amazing work, hanging on to his video camera as he runs from one battle zone to another, is attacked by some vicious insect-like pests, has to find a way to move between two buildings that are in the best of shapes, and he has to correct a few crisis of his own, as our four characters try to keep one step ahead of a creation that Godzilla would envy, and the U.S. Army has a hell of a time trying to keep under control.One thing is for sure, we are left wanting more, as the X-File look and feel of the film doesn't really tell us much about the origin of the creatures, the final resolution, and well, we want to see more of the damage and destruction that is done to NYC. One thing is certain. there is plenty of nifty special effects, as fire balls, bombs, bullets, minor earthquakes, and some destructive attacks make sure some landmarks go from contemporary masterpieces to historic ruins in seconds. The shots involving the Statue of Liberty and a famous bridge are cinema classic moments now.'Cloverfield' doesn't lack suspense, excitement, and some very scary moments. Not since 'Alien' and 'Aliens' have I felt this degree of involvement with the ordeals of the main character. It demands to be seen over and over to appreciate many of the scenes that go by at hair raising speed. It is a great film!",10,2,10,21 January 2008
Silent Hill," Ambiguous and a Visual Treat
","Beware!!! Here is another film where we never know exactly what is going, and yet that is part of the fun here. The film's story might not be its strongest point because there is not a lot of originality here, but there are new approaches to the old theme of good vs evil, or is it stupidity vs. evil, or might it be just 'I don't know what I'm doing here vs. You have no idea of what's is going to happen to you here'... Whatever the case might be, the atmosphere, and yes, surprisingly the acting are very good, making sure you get your money's worth, pretty much the way, a roller-coaster ride gives you some thrills; you don't have to worry about anything deep or lasting.First of all, I am amazed at how much computers can do. The design of the town and its inhabitants should be acknowledged as some of the best of the year. It's unconceivable that work of this quality never makes the list in those top 5 or top 3 awards shows. The idea is to recognize the best of the best in each category, and there are some amazing creations in here. We have seen spooky interiors and netherworld before, but the scope of this universe is something to admire. There are times when you literally feel that Dante's Inferno could have used some of these looks for inspiration, or maybe you wonder whether this director and his production theme should go ahead and tackle that type of material. The haunting quality feels like much more than just a set. It consistent and strong. It compensates for the gaps in the narrative's logic.There are some powerful ideas here, and I like the concept of God/Mother as a symbol. I don't recall having seen it before, and its works very well here. As previously mentioned, the principals in the film are quite effective, especially the fanatic priestess who has a key role in the last half of the film.The story of a child in distress has been done before, yet it is the ride that is much more fun this time. Starting with the typical beginning that takes the mother in search of what can save her child. It is not the most practical move, but we have to get to the that haunted town somehow, don't we? The ending is much more successful since we know that things might not be what they seem after all. What in the world is happening with that little girl? What about that other girl? What is her role here? Don't worry about it. Just have some fun and pretend like you really don't care. This is light entertainment (well it's a bit dark, too), and it's to be enjoyed!",8,1,3,1 May 2006
Once," Falling in love with the right person and yet...
","Here is another take on the boy meets girl, boy wins girl heart, and boy is left... There is a lot to like in this film of a struggling artist who meets his muse only to discover that there might not be much of a chance to go past the original spiritual connection. For thousands of years, people have 'fallen in love' and enjoyed themselves for a while, only to discover that it might not have the real thing. In 'Once' we follow our two protagonists as they begin to explore the possibility of finding something deeper and extraordinary in their lives.Through the use of songs, quiet moments, deep conversations, and simple camera-work, we witness how much closer they become. The two lead characters are very likable, 'guy' shows an edgy, soulful side as he writes melodies and lyrics for what is unable to express otherwise. His dialogue is quite limited, but his songs are pretty expressive. 'Girl' is an immigrant who by all means shouldn't be able to communicate this well, but transcends that limitation with her appreciation of music, her own, and others'.The camera-work is not very exciting, and there is plenty of natural light here to emphasize the fact this is a quiet and simple exploration of a simple relationship. The result is extraordinary as we are moved and are able to feel some of the same emotions that 'guy' and 'girl' are experiencing. It's a sweet and lovely film.",9,3,5,26 May 2007
The Hateful Eight," You Just Never Know Who Might Be The One
","Quentin Tarantino is a man who knows how to put together a good yarn. He can bring originality to what from the surface seems to have been done a million times. Unlike that other unbelievable tale set in the frozen forests, this one has a collection of despicable human beings who might or not be who they claim to be. For three hours he treats us to biting exchanges, full of sarcasm, insight, clever lines, and some situations that because of their ugliness shouldn't be funny, but we can't help laughing at human flaws.Helped by a brilliant cast, including Jackson, Roth, Jason-Leigh, Madsen, and more, he keeps us glued to the screen, not wanting to miss any of the 'chapters', the clues, the red herrings, the constant barrage of insults, and of course, the twist at the end, and a visual feast that will surprise even those who are accustomed to his usual display of violence.One prisoner is being taken to Red Rock where she will be tried and hung. Along the way people join that party, and they eventually find their way to an outpost where things are to become more complicated. Set right after the Civil War, we find people are still affected by the political and civil wounds of the country. Jackson is a man who has never held back, and what is truly enjoyable in this tale is that there are no weak links, no matter how small the part is. There is no doubt: everyone is dangerous and not to be trusted. Unlike 'Force' we don't stop to think whether it was the casting that ruined the part, or if the part was written that way. There is no ambiguity here. There are bad people, and there are really rotten ones. There are those who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and there are still plenty of surprises in a story that shines for its unity and consistency. Even moments of unspeakable beauty while horses pull their carriages speak of coming danger. It's pretty, but it's not safe. With the help of expert cinematographer Robert Richardson, and a killer score by the always sublime Morricone, everything in this film just works marvelously.No moment in its three hours is wasted. We fear the cold, the dark corner in the room, and we later find out that no spot is safe here. No metaphysics here, no unbelievable shots of super strength, just damaged goods from the beginning. People come up with the more twisted reasons for doing what they need or want. However, there is also the need to survive, to learn, and hopefully to move forward. We don't get long takes for us to know how miserable the surroundings are in and outside any dwellings. We see fully developed human beings, who tell us their life stories with snappy dialog or a wink of an eye. Smiles, smirks, laughs all have meaning. People cry, shout, yell, slowly deliver a powerful message to their adversaries or to us. The film has acting, lines, and technical elements of first quality that impress us because they are good not because they might be hiding weak spots. The package is loaded with snakes, and you'd better watch your hands, your backs, or in some cases, your head.This film ranks among Tarantino's best, and we are grateful that he continues to deliver some of the best cinema can offer. We can tell he loves movies, he loves writing movies, and we love him for that.",10,4,18,3 January 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Winning Streak
","It feels good when one goes to a movie, and everything works out, both in the audience and the film. Coming right after 'Wonder Woman', the new Spiderman feature is a winner, with the right balance of wonder, fun, and danger. Both films have fantastic performances by actors who seem to understand and fully impersonate their special characters. Tom Holland, appeared at first, too frail to fill Garfield's shoes, but he surpasses him because here is a character that fully enjoys the growing pains and the gadgets he is not quite entrusted with.The story is simple and a reminder of those serials of old. Peter/Pedro is basically in trainer both in high school and the superhero world. Of course, there is a mentor, and this one is both cranky and practical, quite resourceful and handy to have around. In spite of being in three 'Ironman' and a couple of Avenger films, Tony Stark never quite felt human. He bonds very well with his protégé. This relationship, though not being the heart of the film, gives it a solid base.Thieves get their hands on some powerful alien energy source, and they seek to make some good cash with it. We don't hear much of imminent end of the world or having adversaries that are not quite easy to understand or defeat. That doesn't mean Peter won't have a tough time dealing with the various hurdles along the way. One wonders what he is going to do in the last third of the film when he loses an essential part of his tools.There is romance, funny moments, misunderstandings, and a full understanding of what it feels to be a teen, an outsider, and someone who lives for studies and now has an opportunity to 'do something for the world, fighting those bad guys'. It's refreshing to hear that he wants to be the neighborhood hero and fight the small criminals. The film does a very good job creating this environment when Peter visits the local deli and finds himself trying to save its owner later on.Of course, there are all these people who interact with him, don't quite know what to make of his comings and goings, but they still love him nonetheless. Marissa Tomei is wonderful as his 'cute' aunt, and his best friend is a kid who doesn't quite match anything we've seen before. He's a bit too enthusiastic about his role as a sidekick, but there is sweetness and innocence oozing from every single pore. He is a perfect match for Peter's (Tom Holland's fresh take) on the main role.Be prepared to have a good time, with a good story, good acting, and a pretty return to what makes comics successful. We don't want too much because we lose our connection. We want clever, creative, and human.",10,119,234,9 July 2017
Knocked Up," And they tried to live happily ever after
","Previews can be amazing if done right, when they don't misrepresent the product or try to tell you the story in less than 4 minutes. 'Knocked Up' revealed just enough not to spoil the surprisingly effective comedy that is bound to earn people's respect and make a few fans of its strong and engaging lead actors. Both of these players give outstanding performances as the very different people who must now deal with more mature issues than they are accustomed to.Hegel is lovely as the professional woman who wants security and love in her life and now has to deal with a less than responsible and immature boyfriend. She recalls the sweetness and insecurity that made people like Lombard and Monroe so successful at playing this type of characters: human and vulnerable. Seth Rogan has an even more difficult task because he is the likable yet irresponsible man that somehow must be likable, still remaining true to his rather irresponsible nature. Will he ever grow up and learn to deal with his responsibilities? Is that possible? The film provides you with some interesting answers.The film somehow manages to balance emotions ranging from absolutely vulgarity to some refreshing sweetness, the latter sorely missing from Apatow's previous efforts. In the end, the true surprises are the solid direction and terrific, consistent script that keeps us interested and caring for a good couple of hours. The writing is meaty, insightful, even precious for it knows the materials, the weakness and strengths in all of us, and it puts them all together in a very satisfying piece of film-making.A new classic has been born... and a few stars along the way.",10,2,8,3 June 2007
Alien," a fine classic
","In an era where spectacle and special effects have taken over, it is refreshing to see a re-release of a classic.  When 'Alien' came out in the late 70's, it scared the hell out of me.  It was dark, scary, packed with tension, and a realistic and horrid creature.  We had no time to worry about words, but about the survival of the crew, and as if everyone knows by now, chances of escaping were dim.Ridley Scott's directing job is probably his finest.  When we first wander into the planetoid, we are fully transported there with a sense of foreboding.  The place is unlike anything ever seen before.  There is plenty of wonder, but it's also colored by the possibility of terror in its dark atmosphere.  People might have criticized the screenplay for not developing the cast enough, but that would have diverted the focus from the main story line.  How do these people get out of this mess?  These are strong and defined characters, but they don't have too many lines because they don't need them.  The scientist for instance, works beautiful because it all happens in his eyes.  We don't need to know or hear what motivates him. Ripley is a strong, silent, and direct heroine.  She is fantastic.The alien rightfully earned its place in the classic monster pantheon.  Here is a beast whose nature is not understood.  We witness its magnificient design and purpose, but we don't ask too many questions.  It is beautiful and horrifying, appealing to us in unexplainable ways.  We fear and admire it at the same time.The new edition features a gorgeous remastering of the soundtrack, and one can now fully appreciate the superb score.  It should be mandated that the classics are released again in the big screen.  DVD's are wonderful, but some films deserved to show their magic in the best possible way.",10,1,3,2 November 2003
The Polar Express," beautiful, but those eyes...
","This film will probably become a classic, and many people will love it. There are sequences in it that truly honor the spirit of Christmas, but it would have been lovelier and more commendable had people looked at the expressions on the main characters. The children look like they're 'sleepy' or under the influence of some harmful substance. Why did this happen?Some of the animation is truly outstanding, there is a couple of catchy new songs, and yet, the payoff is not quite what we expected it. Still, the children will enjoy it.Robert Zemeckis did an awesome job before. Is there a chance he can do what George Lucas do and go back and fix it a little bit? Then we will probably have a true classic in our hands.",6,2,4,13 November 2004
Suicide Squad," Too dark, too much, too many
","I was excited when 'Squad' was first advertised nearly a year ago; slowly with the flooding of super hero movies which continuously disappointed me, I lost interest because I felt it was going to happen again. People started talking, and it looked like everyone was interviewing Robby, not Leto (a bad sign). The film was disappointing to say the least.It was an intriguing concept: to have the most dangerous villains and criminals fight an impending terrorist attack. First problem is that how do we come up with such a threat when those characters are already pretty wild to begin with. Place Batman in the position of a mailman, and you have a dark and loud mess again.So the story unfolds, we see Viola Davis, looking tired and frustrated, without any of the energy she usually projects no matter what she plays. Batman flies in and out of the picture. The rest of the characters are reduced to gestures and grunts. Ledger's Joker haunts this film along with Nicholson's wild creation. I kept thinking I want to see the thing from The Fantastic Four, Bane from 'The Dark Knight', anything that reminded me of a real, classic, comic book creation.The exposition is a bit clever, with a sprinkle of logic, and the only that kept me watching was Robby's twisted and sexy psycho. After that, the film degrades into a loud display of sounds and special effects. Did anyone learn anything from 'Superman' and 'Batman vs. Superman'? In the end, I felt like I wasted 2 hours of my life. I will definitely think more than twice before I see another comic book film.",4,1,4,7 August 2016
Shutter Island," Mind Games
","When Clarisse wanders into the restricted cells in 'The Silence of The Lambs', the tension is overpowering. It is a murky combination of danger and disgust, as the inmates are poised to attack and abuse. With Demme's intelligent and flawless hand, we are slowly descending into a world where insanity lurks and at times can overpower us.The premise in 'Shutter Island', somewhat adapted from Lehane's engrossing and mind bending book, is that the lines between sanity and insanity sometimes blur. We follow Teddy (DeCaprio) in his adventure inside a mental institution as he tries to discover what has happened to some of the inmates there. The story unfolds like an onion, layer by layer, in Lehane's original narrative. In the film, the delicate construction is taken over by a series of monotonous dialog between some of the main members of the cast, which lessens the suspense and weakens the power of the main plot line.DeCaprio is one of my favorite performers , and he is in good company here, as Kingsley, Von Sydow, and Williams show amazing support. Sadly, DiCaprio's turn is out of place and miscast. 'Revolutionary Road' gave him a chance to demonstrate how good he could be at showing psychological despair. In here his broad turn is lacking in some of the details one would expect from such a conflicted person. This becomes more obvious as we go through a parade of people who might be in a similar position. The ever present doubt and paranoia works best when one looks at the rest of the cast, and how they handle their respective roles. With DiCaprio, he seems furiously driven by an obsession that we don't share. It is as if Scorcese has concentrated more on the style of the gorgeously photographed and produced film, but he has neglected the story and the main actor's performance subtle points.It should be more haunting, fuller of despair, drenched in sadness, and the best some people of the audience could say was: 'this was a creepy film...' For whatever reason, I don't think that is what Lehane originally intended.",5,2,7,21 February 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Actions, Brains and Intrigue
","There was something rousing about the first 'Captain America', with a heroic turn by Evans who adapted quite well to his newly found mission. The ending was of course a bit disconcerting, as we saw him make an uneasy transition to the modern world. It becomes more complicated in the sequel where we find out that those darn agencies are hiding way more than we expected, and that the competition might be tougher than we believed possible.Steve and Natasha need to join forces and work carefully in order to stop Hydra's ultimate takeover. The problem is that their main source of support is handicapped when treachery strikes. If you add to this the fact that there is another soldier out there who match Captain America's powers, the fights become more intense and exciting.The script is intelligent, designed to give us quite a ride because it is a combination of smart dialog, quick to deliver the gist of the plot, without tiring us with convoluted scenarios. The editing and special effects provide the perfect balance as we are treated to some spectacular visuals showcasing some terrific technology which includes great fight choreography. It will please most of us in the audience.I was thinking we're being flooded with the characters from the Marvel universe, and it would become too much. However as long as the story draws us in, the actors more match our preconception of what these characters have become for us in our respective imagination, we will have a marvelous time at the movies.",10,0,2,8 May 2014
Capote," Cold Manipulation
","Every action has a reaction, and watching 'Capote', we can't help but wonder how it ever got made. 'Capote' is entrancing, dark, depressing, and quite satisfying. It benefits from Hoffman's perfect performance. He embodies the physical and psychological make up of a man who was the toast of the nation before and after the publication of its classic novel, 'In Cold Blood'. As a human being, he appeared to be an intelligent, fascinating, and manipulative creature. He could have gotten away with almost anything. Then he found the two criminals behind one of the most heinous crimes of the century and might have gotten to the realization he could also be trapped by their own dark existences.It is difficult to ascertain what happened to Capote after he developed a relationship with Smith. He grows attracted to the actions and revelations behind this killer, and we never really know what is exactly going on. There are displays of guilt and detachment at different parts in the film. What we do see is that something really affected the man, and it changed his life for good.The film moves slowly but never loses its audience. Along with Hoffman, a remarkable supporting cast keeps us interests going, and enough is presented to make us want to know more. That will probably be the film's only flaw. It fails to deliver everything it promises. It is a big satisfying tease, but after all, we are left with an endless number of questions. Keener is wonderful as Capote's supporting friend, and in his lover's role, Bruce Greenwood intrigues us as well, with the dubious character that never gives enough information to explain his attraction to a total opposite.'Capote' is a really good film and should be admire for it achieves. For those who want to explore more in depth what lies behind the protagonists of the movie, there are several books that will give you a more detailed background on their nature. The truth, will however, remain, a big mystery.",9,134,165,9 October 2005
Life of Pi," Sublime Filmmaking
","We live in an era of cinema where it's very difficult to feel fulfilled with contemporary movies. There is some dissatisfaction about how the emphasis is on special effects and more than often the script is weak in comparison. Also, some people associate only serious themes with quality, and we can't help but wonder why we seem to place so much weight on period/costume movies while evaluating films. Thankfully we have people like Ang Lee who will not put a film together if the elements don't fit. With the exception of the 'Hulk' which looks right and has a good story, yet it didn't quite match his other accomplishments, and he has tried just about every genre in cinema.Here he gives us what could be his absolute masterpiece, 'The Life of Pi' a film that works in so many levels: it's entertaining, wondrous, a metaphor for faith and the power of life, for just about every feeling we can think of or feel. It is so powerful that every single frame and line in it has a purpose and grabs our attention in a gentle and yet, sure way. Once the film begins, you can't look away or engage in any other thoughts, and all sorts of annoying technology (other than the one in the screen) is forgotten. As a member of the audience, you want this superb piece of imagery and storytelling to continue charming you, teaching you, getting inside your head, heart and soul.Pi tells his amazing survival story to another man, a writer I believe, and the beginning of the film provides the background of a young man who believes in spirituality and searches for answers from early. Later on, as the story takes him across the world, his beliefs and faith will be tested in several incredible ways. Pi is from India, and he has a connection to living beings and other spiritual entities. His family doesn't quite understand his hunger, but his mothers tells the others to allow to pursue what he feels is right.As they decide to move to Canada, tragedy strikes their ship, and Pi finds himself stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, with a few animals that managed to escape from the cargo holds. His odyssey, with Mr. Lee's amazing control of every possible film element, from one of the most sensational pieces of editing, some magical cinematography, sound effects, and a lovely music score, we learn, as he does that there are a few miracles out there, and most of the times, encountering them is a test of the soul.Most of the interaction is between him and Richard Parker, a Bengali tiger that has as much will to live as Pi does. Lee has filmed some unbelievable scenes, and I am still in awe about the way he did accomplish this. It's either the wonders of great editing, some quite sensational computer graphic imagery, or just plain terrific direction by Lee.Pi and Parker's main goal is to survive, and they start by outsmarting each other and proving their worth, claiming territoriality, and giving us some thrilling and at times, very funny and scary exchanges. Eventually, as the story reaches its last sections, we see another type of link develop, and a film that is certainly qualifying as a wonderful movie from its beginning has now soared into greatness. The audience must be ready to gasp, and choke as powerful expressions, sometimes wordless acting force us into looking into our own emotions. Tears will inevitable roll out as you witness beauty rarely shown in movies. 'Pi' is surely one of the best films ever made, an instant classic, and a reflection into humanity, those entities we choose to guide us through our human trek in this world. Whether or not you believe its message, can relate to its ideas or just enjoy its execution is entirely up to you. It does offer an interesting choice at it concludes. You decide. Either way, it will move you.",10,6,12,2 December 2012
Ocean's Thirteen," Extraordinary Comeback
","'Ocean's Eleven' felt like an intelligent and entertaining movie. It did very well with the story and its diverse cast, and it benefited greatly from the start leads.... Then came 'Ocean's Twelve', and maybe t was the extra cast member; it just felt bloated and dragged.Now the gang is back, and few people might disagree with any of the following descriptions because this sequel is truly spectacular, engrossing, sensational, wild, intelligent, remarkable, quick-paced, clever, striking, original, sexy, funny, surprising, appealing, vibrant, colorful, and the list could go on and on.Films like these work well when the adversary is something to fear, and Pacino's millionaire does bring with him class, and a few scary maneuver. He hasn't reached his level of success for being Mr. Nice Guy. This time the offense is personal, and Ocean recruits his gang to set things right, and if this requires that the plot of the film becomes a bit complex in its execution, it's o.k. After all, we need equal amounts of intelligence, charm, elegance, and a touch of double-crossing. As the second in command, Ellen Barkin exudes intelligent sensuality and carries her duty with aplomb of stars from days lone gone. Here is a sexy and mature actress who knows how give a look, make a move, and wear a spectacular dress, all while conducting daily business.The rest of the cast is equally outstanding, Clooney, Pitt, and Damon once again demonstrate why they have become popular leading men. Each could carry the film on his own, but we're grateful they know how to share screen time. Unfortunately there is not enough time to mention everyone's contributions. Let's just say, the parts make the whole work very well.Much of the success of the film is also a result of fantastic CGI, art direction, and set decorations to bring to life a fictional world in one of the biggest and most competitive playgrounds in the world. The new hotel is both garish and impressive, with loving care given to the design of gambling environment and other hotel sections. There is also sufficient time spent on explaining how the hotel business works, without overwhelming us with too many details, just enough information to give us a taste of the cutthroat world that Las Vegas can be.Sodenbergh successfully shows how good a director he can be, once again presenting us with a treat rarely seen in Hollywood, an intelligent, entertaining, and well developed story that supports a very good looking cast and film.",10,1,6,10 June 2007
Lost in Translation," muddy mess
","It always makes me wonder when I see too many of those raves appear in newspapers right when the movie opens.  To be honest, I was intrigued by the premise, the preview, and the casting.  Sadly, that is what made the film so terribly disappointing.  Once again, we seem to be suffering from a case of 'The Emperor's New Clothes'.   Do we need an innocent bystander to come by and tell us that we are really witnessing plenty of thin air?Ms. Coppola's 'Virgin Suicides' was rich and involving, with enough tension and conflict to drive its entire length.  In 'Lost' I remained lost for the entire movie, as at first I couldn't even see the action.  To this day I can't understand why many people confuse style with underexposure.  There are many beautiful films where natural lighting serves a purpose. In 'Lost' the only thing I might get out of this poorly lit film is a new eye-prescription.  Is there a shortage of electricity in Tokyo?  Are they rationing power after midnight?  Is there a reason why the film looks so murky and blurry??? even in the daytime.  Maybe it's supposed to be a metaphor for the state of their souls, but in my opinion they would have made a better point if we could at least see their facial expressions while the main characters suffered.Not all is lost in the movie, and the leads do what they can with the material, but it's hard to sympathize with such a minimal exchange.  How in the world can anyone relate to another person with the exchange of less than a dozen words?  It is more puzzling when there is such an age difference! There have been other films when two the leads' age difference is overcome by better direction and a more solid script.  In here, we are asked to fill in too many holes and assume too much.  Bill Murray mopes around, so he's lonely.  Scarlett is abandoned by her boyfriend, and she's in need of male companionship.  Where's the background?  Where's the story?  Where's the character development?Overall, I was so utterly shocked by what I saw that the people that came along with me, were even more shocked because they couldn't believe I didn't say 'It sucks!' when the film ended.  I didn't have because they already knew it, and apparently most of the audience in the theater were still in stupor as they slowly filed out of the auditorium, with no audible comments.I would like to know if there was another print shown at the critics' screenings because I am sure the reviews we're reading most be addressing a masterpiece, but that film is missing, somewhere in the murky presentation, lost in its own translation.Read the book.  Skip the film.",1,3,6,28 September 2003
Tangled," A Bit Off
","When 'The Princess and The Frog' came out, we rejoiced because old fashioned animation, a strong storyline, a different yet strong heroine, and some very funny moments had all worked well to give us a new classic. It was indeed a very good movie, with marvelous music numbers and gorgeous animation.This year, the animation, with the help of more sophisticated computers, has achieved new heights, creating a softer, more natural look, to resemble old fashioned artwork. The problem is that the other elements are not up to the technical standards. We have rather bland vocal entries in most of the leading performances, and both the music and the storyline could have been much better.As it is the case in most of the films we see nowadays there is strong emphasis on coming up with 'potentially good ideas', yet their development somehow comes short. Here our heroine's dreams, which we sympathize with, draw us into her world, and we can't help but admire the simple but strong young woman who tries to break herself free from the only world she knows. To get there, she is assisted by a dashing young man, who must learn to grow up as well.While as the heroines of recent animated stories, all have assertive and independent personalities, mostly based on their embracing knowledge through books ('Beauty and The Beast'), poor bravado and curiosity ('The Little Mermaid'), or the aspiring chef of 'The Princess and The Frog'. Those characters mesmerized us, with the help of clever, intelligent lyrics, and hummable melodies. 'Tangled' can't compete in either department, as the very simplistic, underdeveloped characters are poorly served by the pedestrian lyrics.There are a couple of magic moments in the film, but even those feel forced, as part of a design, not of a fully realized work. Nothing here can match the anxiety and sadness of the furnace scene in 'Toy Story', the wonder of the birth of love in 'Beauty and The Beast' or witnessing mortality in 'Up'. Animation has grown so much recently; it's hard to feel satisfied by efforts like this film.",5,6,36,11 December 2010
Doctor Strange," Time Again, Again, and Again.
","Finally a Marvel movie that relies more on character and solid acting than what we have been overexposed to lately. I've enjoyed a lot of the other super heroes, but unlike the Indiana Jones movies, the special effects overpowered the spirit of these stories, the one that made reading those comic books so much fun. Story lines got too complex, heroes were always celebrities more than super stars. We didn't see Ironman; we saw Downey. Yes, the sets, effects, and costumes got more and more impressive, but something was beginning to fade. 'Doctor Strange' rekindles some of it with the help of some very good talent.Cumberbatch, who has done with wonders with 'Sherlock' and Swinton, whose special look makes everything she takes, carry an extra dimension are both perfect as the heart and 'mind' of the story. Here's a superhero who has plenty of ego to pursue his quest and conquer others. What's more, what happens when he realizes he has the means to manipulate space and time, and propel a very impressive mind to even more powerful levels. It would seem as if this is the one superhero that can solve just about any problem, but there are dangerous forces lurking both inside and outside his immediate surroundings.Knowledge can be dangerous when coupled with a powerful ego or a misguided dream. Strange soon discovers that there is more to his ability to learn than his photographic mind. Apparently, he has the gift to connect with other mythical forces and at times, defeat them. His adversaries are strong, too, and like him, they have learned to manipulate powers in order to get what they need or want. One thing that is clear from the beginning of the story is that this superhero might not even know what he is supposed to be. His mind pulls him one way while his conscience dictates other paths.There are key moments and lines in the film that foreshadow his being quite special. He attempts to learn the tools of his new 'career', and he's told that the tools will choose him when the time is ready, and in one of the best scenes in the film, Strange discovers that he will develop a codependency with his cape. It's one magical moment as he makes it part of his outfit, his uniform, himself. It's Batman and his mask, Superman and that 'S' on his chest. We're seeing a very strong personality arrive, and we want more and more of him in future films.In order to captivate us is a pretty impressive display of visual effects. The visuals of cities turning themselves inside out is impressive, but underwhelming since we really don't see much of a purpose there, but there is potential in the ability to combine dimensions and worlds within worlds. There is of course, much pleasure and possibilities when trying to play with the natural laws of time. 'Strange' doesn't quite miss any steps, playing with this angle. It's quite a moment when 'Strange' takes the concept of time loops to bargain a deal near the end.Of course, making use of the dark forces, or simply using it to become more and more powerful will have repercussions. These are not clear, barely hinted at, and at the end of the film, we get hints of what's coming. The rather nebulous exposition in another superhero movie becomes more fascinating, as we see a new alliance being forged, one that could turn the universe upside down if 'Strange' eventually meets that other dark lord. There's also another preview of what would happen if 'Strange' faces another of the masters in the future. Both possibilities are quite exciting and make us feel that the Marvel universe will be a more entertaining and imaginative one again. It's time to get away plots that fit more in other genres. We read comics because it's a matter of good versus evil. We're not here to ponder, philosophize or work on a dissertation on the time continuum.'Strange' keeps it simple, though the visuals are mind blowing, and the possibilities hints that the game can become more and more challenging. Let is come, as long as its heart beats strong (even if it needs a little jump starting once in a while). 'Strange' combines both the brain, the mind, and the imagination in magical ways. Just remember magic is not necessarily a good thing.",9,1,4,7 November 2016
Interstellar," A Relative Matter
","Nolan does it again. He gives us a thought-provoking adventure with basis on the past, present, and possible future of humankind. It makes us ponder about how we came about, where and why we are experiencing the current state of affairs, and the possible outcome. Who is responsible for humankind's future? Who do we relate to and why? Are there any 'they' out there to guide, help, protect us, or send us to our ultimate fate.'Interstellar' follows the journey of a man who is selected to find a possible solution to our dying environment. He stumbles upon a secret, scientific project that might take him to another galaxy where he can find a suitable answer to our problems. What he is told, what happens, and what the others do is what makes the tale so interesting and exciting. However, this is not 'Star Wars' or 'Close Encounters'. It is a original idea that goes beyond what others have hinted at before. What if we dared crossed that border? What if we pushed ourselves a little more? Where does the spiritual and the scientific intersect? Of course, there will be questions about theology, though we hardly hear the characters make any direct references to such entities, but we have a wonderful score that certainly reminds us of what is not being said.In order to get our interests, the outline is laid out, and Cooper (Matthew) is soon on his way to Saturn and the wormhole that will serve as a conduit to the other galaxy where there will be more choices and answers to our questions. Unfortunately, there might not be enough time to deal with the possibilities, and that is where the problem lies. On top of that, there are always surprises along the way, and both nature itself and human nature have a way of coming up with more variables than we care to deal with.Soon the pilot and scientists see themselves in worlds where both gravity, time, and energy take on different manifestations from what we are used to. Some storms are just much bigger and powerful than what we are accustomed to, and there is always hidden agendas, unexpected twists to the story, and our ability to try our hardest when things become really complicated.I truly enjoyed the way some natural events and emotions are explained in very detailed scientific lingo, which might prove fresh to some and too challenging to other members of the audience. What strikes me, too is that though the film appears to slow down for some of these exchanges, it never becomes boring. There is always the lure of mystery, of knowledge, and how the mind is thirsty for some sort of stimulation, and in this film, knowledge is power and salvation, and I found it invigorating and hopeful that books are prominently displayed here.We can see how technology allows Nolan to create a new series of visual and sound effects, which play an important part here, and it is very satisfying to see that space looks 'real', and by the time we are taken through the wildest moments of the ride, we are not disappointed. In fact, the climax of the film is even more complex than expected because here is where technology, faith, and the will to survive blend quite nicely. Nolan keeps his characters real, even when it becomes more challenging to believe there is the possibility of another level to the way we understand the word 'dimension'.All of the performers do excellent work here, with Jessica and Matthew leading the pack. Caine, Burstyn, Hathaway and Damon do very good supporting work, and each one does his/her best to make the story's difficult parts believable and relatable. There is not going to be anyone in the audience who will not believe the way the laws of physics and biology are pushed to the limit because the structure of the film is very intelligent, never going beyond what we understand, and if still a bit incomprehensible, at least it lays the foundations for what might be a more concrete possibility in the future.'Interstellar' will have you thinking, believing, and loving every minute those people are on the screen. We have a little bit of everything, and the balances are just right because even a power emotion like love is somehow explained in a logical way that will have skeptics believing that it is as real anything that scientists can fabricate in a lab. 'Interstellar' shows another side of Science Fiction, making it more tangible, more real, more heartfelt, and way different from what we have seen before.",9,10,21,5 November 2014
Pacific Rim," Finally and Exciting Summer Film
","What's to say about 'Pacific Rim'? I LOVED IT!! For starters, here's a film with a really good story that doesn't pander to us and refrains from those 'way too clever' moments where we supposed to admire the wit of the production team while everything else in the production wasn't done with care, intelligence and love. In here, we can see those amusing bits. The word 'shoe' comes to mind. 'Pacific Rim' entertains, keeps you engaged, while looking for fresh new approaches, and at the same taking time to honor the best of past adventure and science fiction past, paying plenty of tribute to those 'Godzilla' films that were both scary and ridiculous while we were little kids. Someone tried to make a really exciting one a few years ago, but they messed up with the formula. Del Toro brings back those beasts, spices it up with a bit of 'Aliens', 'Predators', 'Godzilla', and 'Blade Runner', and the mix is explosive and cool.The story takes us into the near future, as the world is now exposed to the worst enemy. Something colossal in size that can cause enormous amounts of destruction, and that can be stopped at a great cost. Things become more complicated for humanity when it becomes obvious the beasts are learning and are literally more vicious than anything we have ever encountered, fully capable of fighting and destroying in just about every possible setting, from deep oceans, to land, to air.There is emphasis on the importance of bond and memory, and some people might wince at the mere mention of it, but just thinking about it of those moments that serve as the way we develop a bit of interest on who these people might be instead of just looking at them as background decorations, expendable and boring. I can name a few films where that has been the problem, and we're talking about poorly developed situations and characters.Also, remember to have good actors. Del Toro went back to pick up some of his usual associates for these, and he recruited a few fresh faces without making it look like a novelty. He has plenty of fun blending the best elements of boxing, kick boxing, fencing, nuclear weaponry, and just plain dirty fighting, and you need it with these creatures because they have absolutely no qualms about turning the robots into shredded metal and humans into ground beef.Grab some popcorn, or whatever you like to enjoy while having a great time and enjoy an exciting time at the movies.",10,1,7,14 July 2013
American Sniper," Can You Truly Kill Evil?
","It's almost guaranteed Clint Eastwood will direct a very good movie? He has taken on diverse topics and come up with some pretty satisfying results. 'The Changeling' gave us a study of motherhood and madness. 'Jersey Boys' did a decent job transferring a musical from theater to film, and in the last fifteen years he has directed more than one cinema classic. His latest might just be another one to add to the list. 'American Sniper' blends suspense, action, a fight against evil that might prove to be too much for the parties involved.At the heart of the film is Chris Kyle, a fantastic Bradley Cooper who transforms into a military force who has decided to dedicate his military career to defending his country and helping his military brothers. He's loyal and focused, but this might be a problem since he becomes more and more affected by the world he's trying to destroy. As a result, he sees a deterioration of all that he treasures, as his mind can't handle the resulting emotional trauma of the experiences he has to go through.His main problem is how much he gives of himself. He starts neglecting his family and children, and his obsession, might in some people's opinion, might not let him see clearly. The film doesn't take sides. It lets us observe what it is like being in the middle of this conflict. It's a world where you fight for your survival, where you don't know how death can reach and take you any moment. Chris is in the middle, but he shields his mind from the consequences to himself. He wavers when he's about to cause too much damage. He is able to recognize innocence and hesitate, but the lines blur, and he's unable to leave his work behind. Problems arise at home.Miller plays his tough and supporting wife. She adores him, but she can see how much his assignments are destroying their relationship. There is genuine affection between them, and she tries to save their marriage, but she knows if he doesn't stop, she will become another victim, and we know she'll never allow it. Miller's performance is one of the best of the year because she portrays love, resilience, frustration, anger, dedication, and confusion very well. She develops and expands her character in a way that we never leave her behind, even in the middle of horrific battles. We can see Chris recognizes her presence in the faces of family members who are stuck in these nightmares, and he tries to block it out so much that he is unable to switch modes when he goes back. In one of the most painful scenes, he makes a call and surprises his wife by telling her he's already back in the States, and she can't understand why he's still not home.Bradley is very good at showing the hurt that his mission causes. Yes, he's a patriot, but he also knows how much destruction his actions cause. He can say whatever he wants but he carries a big burden, and it is killing him inside. He refuses to visit Veterans' hospital because they remind him of how ugly his world is, and they can also show him what his own life might turn out to be if he survives. He plays Superman, but he also knows that he's not one.Eastwood has made a much bigger film that we usually get from him. He dares go and show a much more complex picture of this world of war, hurt, and pain. He goes inside the heads of those in the middle, both Americans and the locals. Yes, everyone has two sides, and what becomes obvious is that there are actions and reactions and sometimes the explanations are not so simple. How did it start? Where will it end? Can it really be contained? Can evil eventually disappear? Is evil necessary so we can appreciate the goodness we still have in our hearts? It certainly rears its ugly head at the very end as we see the unexpected resolution. We feel an emptiness because this man was not just a soldier, but a tortured hero that tried hard to do his best, but he was after all another human who was equally vulnerable in many other ways.",10,28,69,29 December 2014
The Devil Wears Prada," Delicious Treat! Encore!
","Here is the best compliment you might want to pay a movie: I want to see it again and again. Here is one of this summer's true guilty pleasures, a film that showcases an amazing, incandescent, and scathing turn by Ms. Meryl Streep. She should be recognized as the best this year has to offer. Her editor from hell has to be one of the best female performances of the last fifty year, a role that is funny, scary, intelligent, and delivered by impeccable comedic timing by one of our greatest living actresses.The film glides, with no dead time, in a little less than two hours. For most of the time, we are given insight into a world that would have been perfect as one Darwin's studies and more than proves his theories: only the strong will survive. Hathaway might lack some of the experience that Streep has, but her performance is almost flawless. She is the innocent that learns to deal with impossible odds and looks good doing it.This is a sharp script that demonstrates that a good screenplay can throw sparks when it's written with knowledge, skill, and care, and in the hands of actors like Streep, Tucci, and Hathaway, it can even catch fire. I could go on lavishing praises on Streep's perfection; let it suffice to say that a movie with a cold adversary, able to to turn humans to mush with a single look or a venomous phrase is much more enjoyable than any mythical rehash that pretends to have a heart, or gasp! worse, save the world when the hero in question can't even show a soul who he really is or wants.It's time to see why original material can makes us cheer and run back to the multiplex and I'd rather have a battle of the wits than a battle of the witless.",10,1,2,2 July 2006
The Lost City of Z," A Sense of Wonder
","'The Lost City of Z' tells the story of a soldier, a man who lives to explore, to discover, to make a name of himself in a world that has started to suffocate him because of the restrictions it places upon him and his family. One day he's presented with the opportunity to find a 'lost city', a place full on wonder and riches, something that will make him famous and allow him to recover his family's good name.Soon, he's in Bolivia, finds his way into Amazonia, and with the help of a native, he reaches the end of a river. There he finds some old pottery artifacts, which plant the idea that something lies hidden in the jungle, the remnants of a civilization that according to legend was far more advanced than anything he has found in the jungle. However, he must turn around and plan a return trip, with more resources and more funding.Convincing his countrymen proves to be more difficult, but with the help of his wife and an antique document that might be evidence of the existence of the lost city, he finds his way back to the jungle, getting closer to his goal. Unfortunately not everything works out as he expected, and the second trip becomes a missed opportunity. When he returns, he has to confront members of the Royal Geographical Society because of a decision he made during the trip. He makes it clear he will go back, but he's delayed once again when he goes to fight for England in World War I.Many years have passed since his original trip, and this time he's joined by his own son, financed both by the Americans and the British. He wanders deeper into the jungle, only to run into other tribes he hasn't seen before. There is some speculation as to what really happen here, but he disappears and never heard from again until an object shows up back in England, and it's the only connection left to the explorer.There is an epic feel to the movie, to the way both worlds are presented in their majesty. The British world with its luxuries and civilization with its rigidity and the class divisions, and the new world, full of mysteries, opportunities, and dangers. It's a world that charms and frightens, with such power and plenty of darkness, with the lure of promises that might or might never come true.The picture is a representation of what the establishment is, and how societies change because of different reasons. One can have plans, but it doesn't mean that they will always be fully realized.",9,13,27,14 April 2017
Southpaw," What a Comeback!!!
","Gyllenhall is a reliable performer. We can count on him giving his best. This means both the emotional and physical make up of his characters. This is what makes a film like 'Nightcrawler' rise beyond its simple premise. He shone in several films before, but his turn in 'Southpaw' has set up new marks, even for him.The film follows a powerful boxing world champion who continues undefeated. His main source of support is his tough and beautiful wife, played convincingly by McAdams. He survives and succeeds as long as she's around because she's his emotional source of support, as well as a great manager who knows and understands his mercurial nature.Unfortunately, a tragic turn of events leaves him widowed, and because of his temper he neglects himself and exposes his daughter to drugs and violence. This will place new demands on him. The question remains whether he will be able to conquer those challenges and regain control of his personal and professional career.'Southpaw' introduces us to a tortured man whose life has been shaped by the worst of circumstances, who rises to the top, loses his ways, and finds new opportunities to fly again. Forrest Whitaker comes him to provide him with training and insight. He's a steady source of support; however, he has his own problems, and these might affect his dedication because both men are driven and sometimes unable to look around for circumstances that might affect the achievement of their goals.Let it be said that most people in the audience will be pleased by the way the film unfolds as we see some exciting boxing pieces, realistic rather than stylized. Every punch is felt, every potential knock out takes our breath, and watching the winner take the prize is indeed an exhilarating experience. Add to that, strong emotional lines, and another great performance by Jake, and we have a fantastic film.",10,1,3,31 July 2015
Ant-Man," A Thrilling Hero
","Just when you thought it was Marvel overkill, here comes a hero that is worth paying attention to because the premise is FUN, and there is probably not a better cast film this year. Paul Rudd perfectly embodies the newly minted hero, a scientific wonder who can switch between insect size (while retaining full-size super powers and speed), and at the same time working with a team of artificial swarms.'Ant-Man' goes beyond the action and super-power to infuse the story with plenty of humanity and humour. We have the silly exchanges with the Michael Pena character (very funny performance), and it's fun to concentrate the villain back to one single character, with a defined malevolent goal, gleefully portrayed by Corey Stoll, who appears to have a good time while reaching for his ultimate goal to destroy his former mentor.One of the highlights in 'Ant-Man' involves the family relationships, shaded by affection and jealousy. Father and daughter relationships mirror each other. Douglas and Lilly are excellent in their dynamics of a flawed bond, and it's interesting to see how Rudd's character is bound for the same problems, unless he changes gears.'Ant-Man' makes judicious use of special effects, which help the student move forward and keep the action full of energy. Here's a miniature universe, full of energy and believability, and we finally we see a villain mutate into a creation that is threatening and worth of our admiration. 'Yellowjacket' might be gone here, but we sure hope he's brought back in some fashion.This film doesn't leave me yearning for comic books or wondering why the technology went haywire, killing some of the originality and humanity of the special universe. I'm glad 'Ant-Man' is now part of the Marvel Universe and will be joining the Avengers in whatever new enterprise is coming up, and I certainly celebrate Lilly's upcoming turn as the other insect superhero. It's time to celebrate.",10,2,6,26 July 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," Finally an Heroic Performance and What a Shield!!!
","Joe Johnston was the man to direct this film. It's exciting, nostalgic, patriotic, and a lot of great fun. For a solid two hours, we get to travel back in time to an era where everything was a lot simpler and good fought evil, without, well, many unnecessary and way too clever for their own good, distractions. Johnston has recreated a time, with a good, old-fashioned turn by Chris Evans, playing 'Captain America', with enough sincerity and bravado to win our hearts and sympathy in the opening scenes of the film. He improves as the story unfolds, and contrary to the usual expectations, here is a film, where the charisma of the protagonist shatters the villain from the beginning. In other words, the formula would have been explosive if the villain had been more interesting, but Evans carries the film beautifully all the way to the end.Throw in a little mysticism, add a touch of Nazism, some bullies, and threaten the country, stir a big dash of patriotism, and a rousing score, and we have a powerful film. This takes me to the rather interesting conclusion. Everything worked very well in the 40's, so what are we doing in another time period? What was meant to be a colorful introduction, becomes an interesting transition, and if you manage to sit through the credits, you'll be rewarded with what might turn out to be the movie of 2012. It'd be interesting to see if Johnston can make lighting strike twice. Whatever happens, he'd better hold on to Evans, a man who now ranks alongside Bale, but without that extreme dark side.'Captain America' will surely be remembered at Oscar time, and it's good to see that it has not been a disappointing summer. Personally, I didn't think I could find something to match the delights of 'Potter VII', but somehow, here it is, and it's a very satisfying experience.",9,2,11,26 July 2011
American Hustle," It looks right, but its just about average
","First of all, Mr. Russell can come up with some dazzling dialogue, and he can stretch an idea quite a bit. For a moment I was wondering if Peter Jackson was around. Russell gives us a caper where double-crossing and outsmarting other people is the main idea. This has always been a sure way to entertain people. Look at 'Clue', 'A Fish Called Wanda', 'Deathtrap', and a few other classic examples, which were hilarious, engaging, and stood up because they had novel approach. In the case of 'Hustle', the performers, with a couple of exceptions, are doing excellent work. The feel of the 70's is there. You can almost smell the polyester and the hairspray, and this film should carry a warning for the scary and extravagant hairdo's most of the leading actors are saddled with.It would be difficult to summarize the plot, except that the key word is one couple tries to pull scam after scam, only to encounter an ambitious and overzealous FBI agent who gets involved and seduced by the others' ideas, overwhelmed by his own goals, and gets stuck in the middle of some very passionate love affairs. If this isn't enough, why not mix in the mafia, some office conflicts, some Italian tempers, a touch of Middle East stereotyping, and in what has to be the worst lack of imagination bring in two actors who are so overexposed, they only help detract from this convoluted mess.Yes, there are some memorable moments, and this is because sometimes the film falls into the episodic trap. Here is the unstable and lonely wife, who doesn't understand the intensity of her personality. Lawrence is wonderful inhabiting the character and showing her talents will keep on growing. Here she's vulnerable and a little scary because of her impulsive nature. Cooper surprises with his physical comedy and outrageous reactions, and an couple of funny scenes with Louis C.K., once again a series of sketches that could fit in a 70's comedy show, but are kind of bumps in the narrative here. The biggest pleasure in the movie is Christian Bale, who transforms himself again, but unlike so many performers who believe a physical makeover is enough to be recognized as 'remarkable performance', gives us a complex and touching turn, as he is able to express a range of emotions that go from pride to complete devastation. He says more with his eyes than our uncredited performer has done through his entire career, not even the 'hairdo' help because he went back to the same mannerisms and facial expressions.In the end, I was hoping for another 'Notebook', but it didn't happen. The promise was there, but the ambition, like one of the main characters' killed whatever potential it had. I guess we've been 'hustled'.",6,2,6,1 January 2014
The Godfather: Part II," Towering Achievement by Pacino
","This film always manages to lose my interest during its second half. The deterioration of the Corleone family structure is unfortunately a very complex task to portray. With Al Pacino's superb turn as the man who loses his soul, the film hits amazing highs. There are moments in the first half, where we understand the roots of what later became the Corleone empire. Robert De Niro does his best to convey the essence of the young Corleone, but its the reenactment of an era through the loving art direction and touching score that provide the soul of the period.The story line sets up the decay that destroy Michael Corleone. Sadly, following the road to its devastating resolution can prove to be a rather arduous task. There are unforgettable moments, as the more seasoned performers use subtle gestures and deliver lines that point to the overall tragedy surrounding the different characters.'Godfather II' ends with a much darker version of 'Godfather I'. All seems lost because this time, the Don lives on, and manages to keep his dynasty going. The question is at what price?",8,1,3,1 August 2005
Rush," Not Quite A Rush
","There is much to like here, mostly the performance of the main character. There was however a technical issue with the crazy editing, which left me dizzy and confused about what some perceive as action versus razzle dazzle. In essence, the film explores what the world of car racing offers anyone who participates of its thrills. As the audience, we are witnesses to the speed, the car designs, the sudden arrival of tragedy. The film goes in deeper and looks at how the drivers become enamored of the rush, and what what would be the ultimate goal.There are two young man who challenge each other to be the best. Each has his own personal agenda and constantly tries to do outdo the other, sometimes, defying family and conventions. It is easy to admire one but not quite like him. It is fascinating how the other can throw a spell on us in minutes. Once they are behind the wheel, they are not that different from each other. They both mortal and vulnerable and liable to have each race be their last. One scene in particular shows a fan being honest as he request that an autograph be signed, just in case...There are emotional moments in the movie, as one of the stars is involved in a fiery crash which could mean the end of his career, and this experience is an epiphany for both leads, as one discovers his own strengths and the other, for a moment, steps back and recognizes the best in both. In the end, both learn to appreciate what is really important, and the final race of the movie is a testament to both courage and stupidity because there is no other reason to have that to placate people's greed and morbid instincts.It is a pity this film shows up the same week 'Prisoners' come out which shows a heart stopping race to a hospital in a crucial scene of the movie. The editing there is superb, where in 'Rush', we rarely get more than three seconds of the camera focusing on the intense moments we are supposed to witness. Thank God for the actors, the costume design, and the technical aspects here. It is a faithful depiction of the world of the 70's, its decadent culture, and the world of racing. Unfortunately it is presented as if we were in the middle of a twister because it is hard to stay focused on an object, a person, or catch that rush that should be an essential part of this experience.",7,0,2,28 September 2013
Nightcrawler," Tough Critter
","There are films you admire, films you abhor, films you despise, and films you love. You decide which of those this one is. This is the journey of a man who has a very unique way of looking at himself and others. His logic defies logical arguments, and you have to at least pay attention to the way he defends his actions and invalidates others' points of view.Your first impression is to dismiss him as a loser who is most likely to end up messing up whatever or whoever he becomes involved with. because there's an air of recklessness to his enterprises. Once thing he does have is the ability to use whatever resource is needed to get one step closer to his goals, and ethics are not going to get on the way. He's an opportunist, and he will crawl into any type of gutter in order to reach the top or the bottom, whichever comes first. He's fearless.He's introduced as a common thief, but he's a survivor, and eventually he finds himself working as a nightcrawler, a man who tries to get to the scene of the crime, of the accident, of the tragedy so he can shoot the most controversial and sensational footage, some striking visuals, and he's the man with the perfect eye, but that skill will only open doors, and now he appears to have found his niche because like some of those creatures of the night, he must be invited in, and then it's up to the others to survive his endless ambition.He needs help, so he hires a really desperate character who puts up with his abuse while they search and find their way to some tragic scenes. He becomes more daring, and soon he finds himself breaking the law and getting lucky breaks of his own, as his competition also becomes part of one of the scenes he's looking for. Of course, our 'hero' doesn't have a problem using that footage.His luckiest break comes later when he confronts his source of income, and he realizes that he can also take advantage of some situations and the thirst for the type of material which drives the ratings. He gets to one of his scenarios before the law, and this is where he pushes every limit, putting himself in danger to get that exclusive footage that will gain him fame and recognition. What we don't realize at this moment is the extent of his plans, and when we see how h executes every step, we can't believe what we're seeing. He knows if he plays the cards right, he will find his way to the very top of this sometimes unethical mess.It's unfair to reveal the last act of the film because this is where the suspense becomes oppressive because we just don't know how everything is going to turn out, and we don't know who to root for. It's messy and horrible Whether he will be able to survive is what we are waiting for. We may not be rooting for him, but we certainly watch, just like people stop along the freeway to catch a glimpse of the wreckage, like we turn our ears to the sound of the breaking news because we know it's not going to be a pretty picture, and that it really shouldn't be something we should be watching, but we still watchGyllenthal is certainly incredible in his performance here. He has given himself a haunting look, and it complements the way his soul is probably is just a rotting and dying entity because there's no way in this universe than a healthy human would be doing what he does, and that he survives and turns into something worse is something that we can't help but stare in wonder. He has captured that process beautifully, though we certainly don't want to be around him or upset him because by this part of the story there's no stopping his unending desire to succeed whether it's right or wrong.",9,1,4,10 November 2014
The Aviator," never quite delivered
","Twice in a row I have been disappointed by Scorcese. He has managed to get some good work from most of his performer, but he fails to produce enough emotional punch to make this a classic. There are some segments that are quite impressive because of their production values. Unfortunately there is very little soul in the package. De Caprio does some of his best work here, and both Beckinsdale and Hepburn are quite impressive. Still, near the end I wasn't sure what I had seen. It felt long and tedious in some parts. I was hoping it would get better. I never felt the passion and the fire in the man, never got to the point where I could relate to his victory or the joy he took in his work. There are 5 minutes in 'Azkaban' where I could feel the joy and glory of flying. I felt like I was watching the sketches or the rehearsals here.Maybe next time.",4,48,94,9 January 2005
Oblivion," Basically...
","Science Fiction films are some of my favorite films of all time, even the ones that didn't make much sense, but that got me thinking and most importantly, moved me. I am still puzzled by the end of 'Space Odyssey', and 'Alien/Aliens' will always be at the top for their stories, execution, acting, and introducing those creatures... 'Prometheus' introduced an interesting premise and promises to expand on it, and I could only wish I could say the same thing about 'Oblivion'. I have to admire its look and its basic storyline, but it failed to make me care for it or its protagonists. To be fair, I was suddenly intrigued by the Jack's confrontation with 'himself', but in my opinion, it never picked up enough steam to succeed, and yet it is a commendable effort.In the not so far future, Earth is just a shell of itself. (I'm a bit scared by Hollywood's new development of films where we have such a bleak future). The population has been decimated by entities that are literally sucking the life out of the planet, and whoever has survived is now away in other worlds. Since the planet is a nuclear wasteland, and there are still some of the bad guys still around, it is necessary for humans to keep an eye out and eliminate them while servicing and maintaining their energy plants. Jack (Tom Cruise) is a very effective technician/sheriff, and with the help of his girl friend and team partner, they do a very 'effective' job patrolling their area.Before we can say 'Hal', and events start getting very confusing, Cruise is having flashbacks, encountering some strange 'things' along the way, and he now is on a quest for the truth behind his own nature. 'Oblivion' keeps you engaged, but it not because of its spiritual force, or for whatever empathy we might have for its characters. I couldn't stop watching the fluidity of the 'toys' on the screen. That helicopter was something as awesome as the Nolan's Batman's transportation vehicles. They did a great job with the editing, and there is nothing wrong with the sound and visual effects, but its soul is cold, and not even Cruise's reliable man on the run routine, and Freeman's powerful vocal delivery can awaken any emotions in us.It's a fun trip into the future, with some lovely and disturbing turns. Ang Lee was capable of showing us the soul in computer animation, and how faith works in strange ways. Ironically, the God in this movie is well, not really human at all, and it shows, and it feels so distant.",7,1,1,21 April 2013
Baby Driver," Floor It!
","Edgar Wright has done it. Just like George Miller's 'Mad Max' entry a couple of years ago, he has assembled what might be the best movie of the year. It's entertaining, daring, innovative, full of exciting performances and thrills. It doesn't compromise, aligns itself with a contemporary period or a disability; it stays true to its genre, and it's probably as cool as a movie has ever been.At the heart of the film is Baby, an orphan who has associated himself with a crime lord (Spacey). He has to pay a debt and is a reliable driver who can outrun the authorities almost 100% of the time. He is well liked and respected by most of the people he works with. However, some shady characters show up to complicate matters. Luckily, Baby has about fulfilled his part of the deal and can now 'retire' from this business.When the film opens, the crew includes a couple who seems to be in love and work well together. Later, it becomes apparent that there is a bit of sadist nature to their relationship, and they might be more lethal that their looks reveal. The new crew shows up, and it becomes clear to Baby that he is not suited for this lifestyle. He's glad to be moving on to better things, and he meets this lovely waiter, Debora (James) which gives him hope the future will be o.k.Baby lives with a deaf man who watches him closely and is very fond of the young man. We notice Baby is also very protective of him. This old man advises Baby to live a simple and honest life; for a while, things are going well until circumstances force Baby to return to his previous job. Things become even more dangerous when a thug (Fox) appears and shows very little patience with others' quirks and mistakes. He doesn't hesitate making threats and demonstrating that people have very little chance to make it when he's around.'Baby Driver' never stops delivering. Each one of its characters is a real person, letting us sympathize or hate their actions. Lily James and Elgorn have palpable chemistry, so watching him try everything he can to keep her safe. Getting this done is going to involve some quick moves, resorting to new tricks, and hoping luck doesn't run out.We have plenty of car chases, with a few of them involving fire power, hot tempers, and some unpredictable turns. Baby's life has never been easy. He carries a load, and as we have noticed actions have consequences, with people he loves, having a good chance of meeting a violent end. The ride is fun, exciting, and pretty dangerous.",10,2,6,12 July 2017
The Matrix Revolutions," ??????
","I was expecting to see a satisfying conclusion to this trilogy, and instead I couldn't figure out whether it was supposed to ironic, or a series of metaphors, or just that somewhere along the strange, dark, and messy special effects, the screenplay got lost.  Too bad because there was so much potential.  In the end, I couldn't even see how much money was spent since so much of the movie was CGI.Maybe someone will write a program (meant a movie) that doesn't lose its way and its taken over by the virus of confusion.",3,0,0,5 November 2003
The Thing," Loving Horror
","Carpenter has always been a favorite of mine. He's not afraid to let his imagination run wild, and he's one of the few directors out there capable to put together a movie that is interesting, exciting, scary, and even, as it's the case here, adapt material that a few people consider untouchable and turn it into a populist work of art. 'The Thing' is the ultimate scary hybrid, a film that takes the best of so many genres and delivers a superb package that few will ever disagree with the fact that it is almost a perfect film.Based on the old classic, Carpenter has made a grungier and more graphic film, with the exception of a couple of gory scenes, the movie works very well, giving us a closer and more intimidating portrayal of the dangers of facing this monster or space alien. Much, like the feral alien, an evil we dare not face or ever encounter, this 'thing' is a formidable creation.As I mentioned before, he borrows a bit from a few directors, to give us style, majestic vistas, exciting and horrific thrills, intense drama, a ton of suspense, and plenty of uncertainty, and that is the soul of the film. First, the science fiction elements which quickly mutate to a cat and mouse chase that evolves into an experiment in paranoia, as the crew finds itself under attack by an enemy that is difficult to conquer, understand, gauge or even locate. Soon, one by one the crew falls prey to their own fears as they don't know who is real and who is a perfect and lethal copy.'The Thing' takes us into a wild ride that will give us what we expect in the movies: great acting, great direction, fantastic special effects manufactured by a crew that didn't rely on the sophisticated technology directors can avail themselves of nowadays. The editing hits all the marks as we follow the creature in its indiscriminate chase of the crew.A lot of people were upset with the ending because it doesn't resolve much, but in truth, it allows us to become participants in the adventure because if the creature is still around, we might have to question ourselves about what the next move might be. It might make you resourceful or just another victim.",10,0,2,8 July 2014
The Revenant," Acting or Reacting? Who Knows?
","So 'The Revenant' is not a landmark film. It will not be remembered as a one of a kind, as a cinematic masterpiece, or as a total disaster. It isn't either because it does have some striking photography, and now I understand why I am not going to be spending Winter in Canada or the most northern states of the U.S. It also cements the fact that humans are one of the meanest species on the planet both on and off the screen.To summarize, Hugh Glass has some rotten luck. His wife and son are killed. He's mauled and barely survived by a scared and testy Grisly. Then, he's left for dead by two men who were supposed to take care of him, and in ways that asks for to believe in the impossible and put Superman or any of the Justice League super heroes to shame, he makes it back to the fort, defying hypothermia, frostbite, every possible infection in the world, and other angry humans. Oh yes... he's alive at the end.It is an impressive production when we consider what the actors and the crew probably had to go through. It looks cold. It feels cold, both in its physical presentation and its connection to the audience. With the exception of Hardy's thrilling performance as the insecure and treacherous hunter, we are witness to the lead actor (or his stand-in) enduring some of the most difficult situations you can torture a human being with. We are to believe that he had to consume some raw meat and fish, being bounced around by what I assume were some type of actors inside a bear rug skin, subject himself to some inclement weather (I sure hope he packed his moisturizer), in addition to riding horses, shooting guns, avoid arrows, and swimming in freezing river waters.The score was fitting and unobtrusive. There were a couple of moments when it got loud, but I suppose it fit the scene. Unlike the deafening interruptions of the gorgeous music in 'The Danish Girl', this was bearable. We survived it. The fantastic composition, all done with natural light was at some moments, breathtaking. I wanted to run and buy the companion coffee table book. Then, I remembered that I had seen a similar and arguably, more beautiful and spiritually resonant set of visuals in that Malick movie that came out a few years ago.There was some good work by the supporting cast, particularly Gleeson, who managed to steal the role of best villain in 'Force Awakens', and he's now proving his versatility here, as a leader with strict discipline but enough heart and fairness to protect his charges. Will Poulter is just standing around and not doing much, trying to hold his own against Hardy, who is as threatening as the surrounding environment. One look is enough to freeze us in our tracks, pretty much like that wild grisly. I was left wondering whether the mama bear could have stood a chance against Fitzgerald.Finally, I have to admit that this was a difficult production. It's all up there on the screen, but I was also wondering how much of it was necessary. It seemed to me like they could have filmed half of it in a more welcoming environment, with the help of some good blue or green screen. Also, the movie was a tad long, with some of moments which lovingly portrayed the savage beauty of the north, adding at least another 30 minutes that the film didn't need. If we had all those beautiful shots, why didn't we get more of the aurora Borealis? Last but not least is the whole premise that there was just too much violence, yet it felt distant. Maybe the audience just got numb and shut down because 20 minutes into the film, we stopped caring about what would happen to them. We knew he would make it, and we had little emotional involvement to care for Glass, his mates, or the indians.",5,6,14,29 December 2015
Bridge of Spies," The Perfect Diplomat
","It has become customary to expect the best from Steven Spielberg, the man behind so many classics in American cinema, and he keeps growing as an artist, always availing himself of the best team, and working along with them to give us the finest quality in the art of cinema. IN 'Bridge of Spies' he has directed an old fashioned film which shows in precise detail how the art of diplomacy might not have been invented but fine tuned, with grace and good intentions. With the help of Tom Hanks, a great choice for the lead character, Spielberg takes on a trip to the past, to show us the world of politics and the Cold War in the 1950's. It's a time of fear and paranoia, a world that expects the worst and chases its own tail in order to find a solution that might not exist. Both Russia and the United States are expecting the worst. Regular people live in constant fear that today might be their last day. Kids receive training in school to get them ready for the moment the world will be destroyed, with everyone living in a cloud of atomic waste.One day a 'spy' is detained by the FBI, and Hanks is hired to defend him, though it's just a charade since everyone knows the result before the case even goes to court. Somehow, Hanks predicts there are possibilities to allowing the prisoner to remain in jail. This sets off acts of violence against the defender for his anti patriotism. Without giving much away, he finds himself in the middle of international deals, with two partners going at each other when one feels the other is either outsmarting or slighting each other. Egos are bruised and soothed, and lives are in danger because arrangements are not that easy to make.Eventually, everything is resolved, not without last minute twists that could undo every bit of work. This is the time when Hank shines, by portraying that everyman persona that makes him so endearing and popular. He wins us over with his intelligence and his big heart. James Stewart was very good at playing this type, and his match is Hanks, a very talented actor who once again proves that with the help of a great team behind him, he has found his niche again, and we are given movie gold.'Spies' brings back a world lone gone, with extreme detail going into his production and much care at the heart of the script. With every performer giving his best in order to fully realize a vision. The result is a classic, a film that makes us think and satisfies us.",10,3,6,18 October 2015
Split," Twisting and Turning into Greatness
","'Split' gives us quite a gift, an audacious and original film that will leave you wondering what you have seen, and it even has a theme: 'you can be whatever you wish...' The question is whether you'll agree with that assessment. James McAvoy knew he couldn't pass on the opportunity to play a part (well, 23 parts within the same character). We get to meet Dennis and the rest of the gang when the stronger, but not necessarily best of the bunch have been plotting a take over. In order to fully succeed, we discover they need three sacrificial lambs.With a tight grip on the camera and his screenplay, we begin our journey into several types of hell: Dennis' own, the three imprisoned victims', the psychologist's slow realization that something is now more unstable than before, which could only mean trouble, and to add a bit of misdirection? a backstory for one of the trapped girls which might be more relevant than some people will be able to understand. 'Split' is a film that you probably need to see a couple of times to fully comprehend. It's sort of like having a great meal, and then enjoying some of the best leftovers from that same meal, and the centerpiece is McAvoy, in a dazzling turn than leaves most of the recent entries in the dust, with the possible exception of Denzel, who like Oliver, Scott, Day Lewis are basically untouchable. McAvoy has joined their ranks, and he has done it with a performance that seems a greatest hits of any actor's career. In fact, he wears very little make up, and one of his most intriguing personas is a woman, but he is fully convincing in a creepy way, wearing a sweater, a long skirt, and not a hint of make up on his face. He retains his male voice, and yet, we believe we are facing a feminine entity. He is fully able to bring out every single element which is the trademark of each personality. The rhythm in the little boy's innocence, hesitation, and fear. His Barry is truly a joy to watch and Dennis is chilling. He manipulates voices, intonations, subtle nuances which fully transition from one to another. In addition to that, we have his incredible command of his physicality. His walking changes, and then we have his eyes and his mouth, doing some of the most impressive I have seen in hundreds of films. Day Lewis was glorious in 'Lincoln' fully channeling the spirit of the President. I'm not sure where the 23 personalities came from. It's like he brought with him his family, friends, and most of the community he grew up with, and then there's the beast.The movie's preview seemed to have given us too much. We thought we knew how the whole story would unravel, pointing to a stock ending. Instead, we are traveling through a structure that shows much growth in the direction of the man behind 'The Sixth Sense', 'Signs', and 'The Happening'. The film is always suspenseful, suffocating at times with the tension originating from the various set ups. We expect bloodshed, mayhem, and what we get is worse because the fear of something worse is hanging over the girls' fate, and we are now caught in their hell, not knowing where the next twist is.The conclusion might seem problematic to some because it brings together every little bit in the background. It fully explains the triggers for both of the main characters, and if we have been paying attention, we'll understand why Casey's fate turns out to be so unexpected. Is there room for more to come? Just like De Palma, we have that twist at the end because after all there's strength in unity, and we never know what we are fully capable of doing if we set our minds to it.",10,7,21,4 February 2017
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Stunning, Dark, and a Great Epic Film
","We have invested nearly a decade, getting to know each of the main characters in this series, and with each book/movie, their personalities and the intense relationship that binds the main protagonists have grown darker and more powerful. In the first installment, we learned that the lives of Voldemort and Potter were linked and the bond might never be severed, even after death. The tone of the books was light and served as an introduction to the magical universe we've grown to love. Seven books later, the universe is crumbling, as Voldemort gains momentum and is getting closer to his prey.From its superb prologue to its magical closing image, this film shows us how masterpieces are created. We are now witnesses to the perfect marriage of good, old fashioned movie making, a time when solid story telling and characterization were the basis of great cinema and eventual classics; with the help of technology and sophisticated camera work, the latest chapter in Harry's story is definitely the most meditative, deep, and dark. Its director has taken chances taking us in a ride which shows the soul of the three protagonists. Giving sure and heartfelt performances, Rupert, Emma, and Daniel have matured into leading actors, fully able to communicate what lies deep inside their characters' souls. The mid section of this movie moves at a very leisured pace, offering us more than a peek into how close Harry, Hermoine, and Ron are, and what they each mean to each other, and consequently us. The gorgeous photography allows us to experience their loneliness, their devotion, their integrity, and how desperation threatens to overcome and destroy them.The magic remains at the core of the film, but it shows in a very different way. Yes, there are displays of the epic battle to come, as we witness the principals prepare themselves for the final chapter, but it is the subtlety of each characterization, and how each performer beautifully demonstrates the powerful writing and how well they understand their roles. Although, this is the young heroes' showcase, everyone gets a chance to shine, and at times it is a a matter of combining the perfect line with the right camera angle.There are hints of what the resolution might be, connections to the past, and they are all elegantly displayed. The flashbacks are kept to a minimum, but each link is effectively shown, with the masterful work of Sierra and Desplat, as they create a mood, revive a theme, and enhance the perfect direction and flawless work of each performer. Two moments stand out among the fantastic work in 'Hallows': A visit to the cemetery where Harry's parents are buried is a perfect mix of anxiety, sadness, and the power of love. The ending to this chapter is also brilliant as the film offers a most revealing perspective into the dark side.The film will hopefully increase the appreciation of the cinematic relevance and craftsmanship that remains the strength of the Potter films. Maybe the inclusion of darker themes and touches will earn this epic film the recognition it truly deserves. Here is a movie that explores nightmares of the real kind. Its nature is magical but the pain is real, and unlike a recent film that relied too much on the technical and the relatively incomprehensible exercise of the power of the mind, this one doesn't forget that heart and mind do go together, with matching levels. There are several moments that will haunt the audience, as we realize that we read, see, and revisit this universe because ultimately we care about this fictional trio and their respective adventures and relationships. Hermoine's beautiful mind and soul would be worthless without her connection to Harry's courage and Ron's passions, and as someone once asked in another one of those fictional worlds asked: 'Do you believe?', we can't help but say, 'I believe, I believe.' This is the best film of the year.",10,4,8,19 November 2010
Little Miss Sunshine," More than a fresh ray of sunshine!
","Here is a film that lives up to the expectations of a very funny trailer. It's an oddball comedy, and it's dark, and it's funny, and it's touching, and it will charm the pants off many in the audience. Here is a simple story in which our lovely contestant and her family try to find their way to California so that she can prove to the world she is not a loser! The premise itself can lead to years of therapy for a family that should get a group rate in psychiatric care.Expert editing and superb comedic performances from all the principals involved will have many overlook the fact that the plot line is a little too contrived at times. The set pieces will have the audience howling with laughter as we see different characters trying to overcome some pretty irreverent obstacles. The scene at the gas station contains moments of deep sadness and offbeat humor, something that Carrell pulls off wonderfully, and none will be able to look at the trunk of a car, some dubious literary material, and highway patrol the same way after seeing the infamous scene in the film.The best is of course, saved for last, and by this time we are waiting for something outrageous which 'Little Miss Sunshine' delivers unapologetically. A classic track will probably be recharged for a new generation, as the bonds of family precariously balance a moment that could be as tacky as they come.'Sunshine' is one of the best things to come out of American cinema this year, an original film that relies on a script that understands the differences between generations in the same family. It doesn't explain why each character is as quirky as can be, and it doesn't build much background because it is not needed to make the film work. Kinnear, Colette, Abigail, Arkin, and Correll are a fine team and keep the film's feel fresh throughout the film. Here is a family that has no special qualities or powers, a family that will make us rejoice that creativity is still alive in Hollywood, a film that will provide us with plenty of much needed sunshine in an otherwise pretty dull summer.",9,341,469,7 July 2006
Knowing," The Future
","Cage proves himself a star again,with a movie that throws a few curve balls at you and manages to keep us interested for a solid couple of hours. Cage plays a mathematician who suddenly discovers a rather puzzling mystery, has his family threatened by a group of mysterious men in black overcoats, and eventually realizes there might be more to his decoding a enigmatic document.'Knowing' has its share of great special effects and a terrific, moody, musical score, but it is Cage's performance that carries the movie, as his eagerness to solve a few problems leads him to convince a few people that he is not wrong about his analysis.The film has children in danger, cities in danger, some apocalyptic set piece, and even a sprinkle of religion in there to stir a little controversy. Putting a bit of disbelief aside, one should sit and enjoy a spectacular tale of doom and gloom, with a dash of hope thrown in, just the way Hollywood can make them.",9,2,5,25 May 2009
Hugo," Gorgeous Sets, Amazing Technology, and The Magic...
","There's no denying that 3D has almost never looked this sharp, but there are plenty of films out there where it doesn't call this much attention to itself; it enhances the cosmetic aspect of the film; it hardly does much for the weak adaptation of the novel. In 'Hugo', as it is the case in many of the of Scorcese's films, technological improvements throw his film out of balance, and this is the beginning of the many flaws in this project.The art direction and costumes are breathtaking, immersing the audience in the right period, though it has barely any of the charm and magic that made another film set Paris this year so successful. In that other film, all the scenes in the various periods are evocative and involving. Here the experience is as cold as a disorganized display in the best museum. It doesn't have much impact on its audience. Some of the scenery could be an exact imitation of the original inspiration. There were a couple of times when the visuals blend perfectly with a few of the clips that are integrated in the film.The problem is the almost absolute lack of warmth in the various relationships between many of the main characters and the way they are directed in this movie. The young man at the heart of the film feels at time as another piece of furniture in the set. When I walked into the theater, many of the people weren't sure if we were watching an animated film or a live action production because they said the actors looked funny. The feel feels so cold in its adaptation of a very interesting literary piece, a book so charming with its integration of words and its simple black and white adaptation. To be fair it is hard to look away because it is so gorgeous, but at the same time, the disappointment hits hard because this is a film that should relies heavily in the sense of wonder usually associated with children's films and/or young performers. Earlier this year 'Super 8' and 'Real Steel' benefited immensely from the outstanding work and charisma of their young performers. The Elle Fanning scene in 'Super 8' puts everything in this film to shame. Where both of those films project warmth, innocence,and a great variety of emotions, 'Hugo' never becomes multidimensional, a big irony, considering its best quality is the nearly perfect 3-D visuals. To make things worse, two other projects involving literacy and story telling, made by Cuaron ('A Little Princess') and Petersen ('The Never Ending Story') have shown that its is possible to blend reality and magic, with the help of the right approach and the appropriate performances.In addition to the lack of emotional magic on the screen, the pacing in 'Hugo' is so slow it borders on catatonic, dragging for most of its two hours. We finally arrive to the last third of the film, a place where the film finally comes alive; suddenly, Scorcese pours his heart in the film, using original film clips and beautiful recreations of the original sources from various classic films of early French cinema. These are breathtaking, as they play, one after another, showing us the sense of wonder original audiences must have experienced. Finally, one is almost overpowered as Toto was in several scenes of 'Cinema Paradiso' as the director viewed the treasured collage in the final scene of that movie, or as the young protagonist of 'A Little Princess' told her magic stories set in exotic India, infused with her own imagination and simple stop motion work. Petersen went even further with the seamless blend of the young man, as he becomes a part of the literary experience, and one realized how powerful the magic in the written word can be. Very little of that exists in 'Hugo', a shiny package, with a rock for a heart.Scorcese has done much for the preservation of cinema, and the original source of this film lent itself to a cinematic production to support his cause, but just like Spielberg chooses other people to direct some of his projects, much more could have been achieved by handing this property to a more suited director, a person who understands innocence, wonder, how important it is to get inside the hearts of people, opposed to working with projects where the main characters are notorious for not having one. Rarely Scorcese has shown in his movies any sort of affection for or between his characters, 'Alice doesn't live here anymore' is a rare exception, and children in it are a bit on the precocious side. Come to think about it, Law showed much more emotion in 'A.I.' as he interacted with the marvelous Osment, and both of them were playing automatons.A big disappointment.",3,226,392,22 November 2011
The Orphanage," Hitchcock would have been proud of this one
","Rarely we are treated to a film that lavishes so many riches upon us: here is a movie with a range of emotions that one never finds for more than a few seconds in Hollywood productions. 'The Orphanage' sustains the suspense, terror, anguish, thrills, jolts, rawness of its subject matter for its near two hours. It never cheats us with a dollop of special effects that usually 'enhance' the lack of talent and creativity in most contemporary films. This movie has such a powerful grip that the audience catches themselves holding their breath as the story unfolds, and the mystery grows stronger as the mother searches for her missing boy.Gorgeously photographed, with an exquisite score, and one of the best editing turns in recent memory, we follow the travails of a woman who is ready to succumb to despair as she can't figure what happened to her sick son. With some rudimentary detective skills and the assistance of some psychic amateurs she puts more and more clues together, but it's her own child's games that might allow her to succeed.There is much to praise in a movie that defies conventions because it is so beautifully made, here is a movie that gives a new twist to a genre that many consider creatively dead, as we have grown accustomed to expect very little from a new wave of directors that rely too heavily on CGI and sketchy screenplays, and an over-dependency on sequels and tired ideas. On the other hand, 'The Orphanage' explores the emotional impact of tragic events on human beings, and the importance of family bonds. It rescues us from apathy and involves us as we start caring for the characters on the screen.Nothing in this film is accidental, with its many references to 'Peter Pan' and some biblical figures. It is a very satisfying film that demands more than one viewing, one film that will creep you out for the right reasons, and that shows maybe one drop of blood in the entire film, an event that should be celebrated as horror is reborn in a grand way.",10,3,8,27 January 2008
Salt," The most fun I had since 'Raiders of The Lost Ark'
","Spy, mystery, and action films are exciting and very good when done right and with the perfect star. Harrison Ford infused the 'Indiana Jones' films with his sense of humour and adventure, and he was certainly a great asset to 'The Fugitive' and the 'Star Wars' series. The formula works well in 'Salt' when Angelina Jolie delivers a magnetic and exciting performance which becomes the furious center of this marvelous thriller.There is not a lime wasted in long explanations and flashbacks to make the story too complex and seem more sophisticated than what it is. Instead it's a non-stop series of chases when layer after layer is peeled, and we are still glued to the screen wondering how this all will end. Thankfully, we still care that the leading lady is someone we care about, even when we don't know what role she might be playing.The film is the perfect length, clocking at under 100 minutes and giving us plenty of superb action, incredible stunt work, and somehow in the middle of this lightweight entertainment, this is a very entertaining film that never lags for one second, some good acting, particularly, Jolie who can transmit more with a couple of glances than a long, convoluted speech can muster. This is not a film that wastes its precious minutes in silly dialogue. It gives us what we expect to see in a movie of this kind, a relentless, nonstop, exciting, and sometimes fantastic adventure where we care about what happens to the protagonist who might be the ultimate heroine or the most incredible villain.In the middle of a series of intrigues which eventually reveal Salt's true nature, and through which she must prove her innocence or be proved guilty, she confronts obstacle after obstacle on her way to one of the most exciting and satisfying conclusion in recent cinema. Indeed, this is a film you don't want to stop even when you might need that bathroom break. No hoopla here, just plenty of top notch work by Jolie, Schreiber, and Phillip Noyce and his very capable team of editors and other professionals.This is one time when I was looking forward to seeing a 'To Be Continued' at the end of the story, and I wouldn't have been one bit disappointed. I am looking forward to seeing more and more of this type of work.",10,7,19,23 July 2010
We're the Millers," Get Ready to Laugh
","Who would have thought this quartet was going to come up with such a funny film? Yes, there are a few 'F' and 'S' spread throughout the film, but they're not as prevalent or overpowering as some of the other films that studios try to pass as comedies. This might not be a perfect film, but it looks good because of great camera-work and excellent chemistry from the actors playing the 'family' members. It's funny how even those scenes that should be flat come out well because these people act and look like they really like each other, and if we believe they care, we care, an important trait of a successful movie: identification with those on the silver screen.The story is simple: A bunch of 'losers' head to Mexico and try to come back with quite a load of drugs. Along the way they find out they might be heading for a trap set up by a businessman without a conscience who is trying to pull a good one on some Mexican drug lords. It's briefly what goes on, but it's those little details along the way that make the film so enjoyable.Anniston is radiant as the stripper with the heart of gold. Roberts is back to hitting the right notes as the girl who is not quite as tough. Sudeikis grows up and discovers more to himself as the film unfolds, and the real find here is Will Poulter, an actor with a unique look who I am hoping finds his way into a successful comedy performer. He is winning and truly funny, and this is not just based on his hilarious rendition of 'Waterfalls', which he does with all of his heart, almost reaching a state of zen and surprising both the people in the screen and the audience.There is strong support from the rest of the actors, but I loved the duo of Offerman and Hahn, playing a ridiculously absurd couple who is seeking a little excitement in their lives, and they do find it, with some funny results. There are several highlights in the movie, involving a 'dance', a 'spider', and 'a kissing session'. You can't help but start laughing.The film ends in an interesting note, and we can just hope these guys make a return visit to a theater near you.",9,4,11,18 August 2013
Disturbia," An Exciting and Disturbing Ride
","'Disturbia' does pay homage to 'Rear Window', its must likely source of inspiration, though the setting has been transferred to suburbia, and our young protagonist is certainly a bit restricted in his mobility. What this film offers is a lot more fun and jolts, as the dynamics among the young people have a lighter tone. Technology, is efficiently integrated into the storyline, and it also showcases some quite remarkable editing.This film will most likely be embraced by many different populations, from the teenagers who have followed the career of Shia LeBoef, pretty good this time out, as the bored teenager who discovers the thrill of studying his neighbors. There are also those people who like a good story, peppered with enough thrills and a very disturbing villain. 'Rear Window' gave us very little insight into the murderer's backstory. He remained distant. Morse's villain is reckless and sickening. A few people in the audience cringed as he approached our hero's girlfriend to let her know that he was a bit upset these young people had crossed the line.'Disturbia' is a bit refreshing since it leaves behind the obvious gore and makes you wonder about what is really going on. Unlike a few pictures that dish out unnecessary gore, this film explores the psychology of the hunter and its prey. It is also a treat that teenagers actually in engage in real conversations, as they explore and debate the consequences of their actions.In short, get ready to have a fun time at the movies again, as D.I. Caruso has given us some thrilling entertainment.",9,2,6,13 April 2007
Silver Linings Playbook," Damaged Relationships
","About a week ago I saw all these mentions of possible award recognitions for both Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper. Lawrence's inclusion didn't surprise me because I had seen her memorable work in this year's 'Hunger Games' and her turn in 'Winter's Bone' a couple of years ago. Cooper's puzzled me because he is famous for his effective but lightweight turns in comedies and a disappointing serious turn in an earlier 2012 film. My interest was piqued, but I was hesitant because Russell's 'The Fighter' didn't exactly thrill me. That perception certainly didn't prepare me for a most pleasant surprise in 'Silver Linings'.'Linings' doesn't give much time to prepare for its intensity. From its earliest frames, Bradley Cooper makes a formidable entrance, giving us a preview of how troubled and disturbed his character is. In other films, we have seen the actor's tricks and desperate call for the audience to admire how good they were. None of that is here. Bradley's physical moves and powerful stares justify the character's history. It's not surprising the neighborhood isn't welcoming back. Even his own family who loves him dearly, hesitates in getting closer because the man is a walking time bomb.Bradley's performance is more powerful and accessible than the one Phoenix gives in 'The Master'. It's direct, clear, with a pain we can relate to because it has clear origins, and it resonates with rawness. We can sympathize with his ordeal, even when we don't understand why he fell so hard and resists people's help. Just when we are getting 'used' and involved in this man's story, we meet another bruised soul, and there is fire to match in Tiffany's (Lawrence)acting. She is, in fact, giving a quieter performance at first, but we can't look away because there's something daring about showing her flaws and still finding room in her life to get closer to someone potentially problematic for her.Both leads have fantastic chemistry, showing how each is drawn to the other by curiosity, physical attraction, and compassion. After all, they surely can relate to her painful losses. Much of the movie's pleasures originate in seeing how this partnership will turn out. We are not sure if they can handle each other, whether this is a good idea at all, and there is a sense of pessimism because we feel this couldn't turn out well.The ads certainly promised humor in this film, and I kept thinking that such sadness and madness couldn't have any room for any of that, without diluting the power of the conflict, but there are moments when we'll have a laugh, which originates in the sincerity of the film's screenplay and how real the characters feel.In all honesty, the film works because both Cooper and Lawrence are giving probably the best performances of the year. In fact, they're so good, they lift a fine supporting cast, and De Niro, as Pat's peculiar father manages to shine in a couple of scenes. There's something very satisfying about the ending, which is hard to envision at first, but we keep hoping for, as the relationship evolves. Be prepared to see one of the best films of the year.",10,2,10,23 November 2012
Divergent," Fizzling Form of Flattery
","I've decided to go back and give 'Divergent' a second opportunity so I could appreciate all the great things I had heard about it, its story, action, acting, and how it worked so well that we could expect sequels to let us partake of more of this trio of novels by Roth.After sitting through more than two hours of something that supposedly happens in the not so far future, a dystopian society where the government has decided to divide into four sections, which depend on the citizens' qualities, and because now there's harmony and everything runs smoothly, peace has been achieved, or so we are made to believe.To be fair, there are good things in the movie, and because they are pretty good, it's only appropriate to give credit where it is due. Ms Kate Winslett once again proves to the world the lady can handle just about any acting job you give her. In 'Divergent' she's the leader of one of the sections, and she looks and acts the part. In fact, she's so convinced she's so perfect for her job, she takes on the job of improving what's already a perfect society, and every time, balance is off, someone is going to suffer. Winslett is cold, efficient, imposing, and pretty good in her 'Divergent' persona. She's already played aristocrats ('Titanic'), interestingly, she's also given us a chance to witness her talents as a member of the lower classes, too, when she throws caution to the wind and joins Jack in the same film. Even better, she's proved that she can survive in a world where a totalitarian leader takes over, without questioning anything about it ('The Reader'). Here she's nothing else than a very smart and sophisticated cold mass assassin, and she gives us a performance to relish, a performance that shines and stands over the rest because there's very little else in this film to call worthy.And yet, there is Ashley Judd, badly cast as the rebel mother who surprises us with her stealthy moves, as a survival soldier who sacrifices her stability to save her family. She tries really hard with that steely core of hers to give her character substance, but the role is so ludicrous and poorly written that I couldn't help laughing instead of feeling devastated in her big scene. I remembered how much I have loved in much better material.Now, on to 'Divergent'... The material suffers from the lack of originality. We've seen this before in much better guise in more entertaining films, and sadly, the other trio of books and films have come out not long ago. The setting is the future, the masses have been oppressed, and the revolutions have started... Does that sound familiar? In addition to that a few other authors must be wondering why other people just borrow without even trying to hide the fact. At least in the case of Potter, the references were elegant, more of a good tribute, and having those phrases in Latin or something like that, makes the whole experience more palatable. It doesn't hurt that the characters are indeed much better written. One certainly wishes there was more magic in 'Divergent'.In addition to the fact that we are dealing with an unoriginal and paradoxically slow action film, full of noise, a loud and disturbing score that doesn't support but impedes our enjoyment of the muddy photography and the very interesting editing techniques, we have two leads that have absolutely no chemistry and a leading character that seems to believe that strength equals a vacant look. There's no transformation from whatever it is supposed to be at first, insecurity, indecision, confusion, to the hardened, both physically and psychologically scarred heroine. It's problematic because the entire premise rests on this transformation, and as pretty as the lead is, there's definitely not much of a heroic soul here. Anyone can hold an automatic gun and pretend they are a good shoot, but we have no Daniel Craig, Jennifer Lawrence, Scarlett Johansson, or anyone involved in the Marvel Universe here. They're both fictional, too, and much better written, performed and realized.I was having a bit of a problem with the setting of the story. Instead of leading through an hour of training sessions and escapades, and a very confusing testing session, I was hoping that someone would explain that train. Why does it keep running? What's going on with the way this society allows the people that don't to wander around? Why are some places to high tech, looking so futuristic, but we have other residences that could pass for Amish in the way they are portrayed? Someone wasn't really doing much to create a believable universe.I couldn't help comparing this film with another one where people engage in the deception of the masses through entertainment but have to become resourceful in order to survive, and there are flashes of social instability that eventually germinate into chaos and revolution. It does help that there is a more solid script and a main character that shows her flaws, her troubles, her growth, and her steel core with her acting, instead of a narration that well, helps get me confused and distracted me to the point I thought I was narcoleptic. Enter at your own risk. If you see this, you might not need that mind controlling serum after all.",1,27,49,21 March 2014
The White Ribbon," Up Among The Best Movies Ever Made, and So Good It Hurts
","Here is a film that has already received its share of recognition, but few people are aware of it because it is sort of a well kept secret. Eventually, the film will earn even more well deserved accolades as people discover it, as they experience a powerful account of how evil lurks in the most unexpected places, and how tension can, without the aid of loud special effects, or contrived and overreaching expectations, can truly feel the human soul overwhelmed by forces that can destroy a soul.Set in a small German village, the film focuses on some mysterious events that rock what at first perceived as a bucolic, peaceful, and nondescript community. In fact, initially, and throughout most of the film, as the drama unfolds, the town is portrayed as a very quiet place, where people might be bored, but they could be in any sort of danger. However, horrible things happen, and they can't be explained, or maybe, the town's inhabitants just chose to ignore them? If one is a careful observer, the signs are there: in the eyes of a child, in the gestures of an adult who moves a little too quickly, in the body language of most of the citizens who remain paralyzed when they should be looking for clues and solutions. There are in fact, too many questions, and not enough answer. There is a tacit acceptance that maybe the actions are justified, and it isn't until innocence is threatened that someone demands intervention.There are magnificent performances here, particularly the ones by the young couple who portray the teacher and his fiancé, each giving each other plenty of information and acknowledgment about each's affections for the other during an era where there is much reservation and propriety, so much in fact that it provides a rather effective cover for the true emotions festering at the core of the village.Symbols are important in this film, and most of them are based in the colors we see: black and white. White, supposedly standing for purity, and black, as being the absence of light, when things of all kinds happen. There are truly horrifying moments in the film, and although most of them are kept off the screen, their power overwhelms the audience, as lies pile, people become accomplices by their lack of reaction, and eventually, indulge in self denial and hypocrisy.'The White Ribbon' has come in too late in the derby and lost its well deserved place in the list of best pictures for the year, but this is just in one group's perspective. I'm sure those of us who are lucky will know its importance, recognize its quality, and will walk away from the cinema knowing that a true classic has been born.",10,3,8,7 February 2010
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," This dragon doesn't soar
","For starters, why did they have remake this one? I would have loved to see the reactions to a remake of 'Casablanca' in 1945, or what about 'Gone With The Wind' with another beautiful actress who lacked the fire Leigh brought to the role. Could I even picture 'Titanic' with another Kate? There was something iconic about the way Rapace's performance in the original 'Dragon'. She raised the bar to the point she might never be able to match the complexity of that performance, an organic, complete, involving role that consumed her and hypnotized the audience. The new film tries very hard to recreate the experience, and it does a decent job in some aspects, but the first film was more than just a performance. It emanated from troubled relationships, from flawed nature, from the way expectations were toppled one after another. In the recent film, changing the ending doesn't quite work; in fact, it hurts the film quite a bit. There are some very good elements in the new film, especially the score, something that permeates the film with much needed energy, and there is something fresh about the way some of the scenes were opened up, particularly near the end. However, it is what has been done to the main character that is painful to watch. In the novel and the first film our protagonist has a troubled background. It interferes with the way she develops her relationships, and it makes her a survivor. She has enough scars and pain in her past to be alert and in a defensive mode. She doesn't trust others, and it is not a good idea to challenge her intellectually. She could be an impressive adversary. Fincher's Lisbeth is mostly style and pouts very well. There are flashes of her strength, but it is not consistent with the source material. Additionally, Fincher has added some touches to the movie that emphasize the ugliness of her world, sometimes it tips the feel of the movie, going a little too far. It becomes too graphic, too lurid, and it cheapens the story.There is also an issue with the way the film is a little too long with the way some of the characters are introduced, and some situations are detailed to the point that it seems to question the audience's ability to make deductions. Did we need to go into a shopping spree to set up the big scene near the end? Once again, I'd love to hear an explanation for the ending? Why?",6,37,61,21 December 2011
Dreamgirls," What would this be without Ms. Hudson?
","It is flashy and contains some very interesting musical numbers. The principals walk, strut, glide, and move around in impressive costumes. Beyonce looks gorgeous in some of the still shots that are scattered through the film and on some of the sets' walls. There is even a thunderous musical number by Jennifer Hudson that threatens to sink the rest of the movie because of its intensity.'Dreamgirls' feels like a movie of the week, made for television, with some impressive production touches. It is 'loosely' based on one of the most successful musical groups of all times, and it is peppered with enough intrigue to have made the film more captivating and interesting, both in its screenplay and some of the musical numbers. Unfortunately for us in the audience, we have to sit through some of the most derivative and boring lyrics that ever reached the big screen. The group in question did succeed, but it did because its music was some of the most entertaining ever to reach the top of the charts. The trio in the movie sounds more like a reject from 'American Idol'. In fact, was it not for Hudson's warm and lively character, we'd be wasting our money.There the issue in question of what happened to the transition of this musical from its early 80's origin to its final presentation. Unlike 'Chicago' which carried some very imaginative staging and clever and memorable lyrics, along with some fiery performances, this one lacks the most important ingredient a movie like this needs: real soul. I kept wondering what it would be like had they placed a real actress in the leading role, and had someone gone back and reworked some of the music. As a reference, there is a bunch of penguins out there who took some classic pop music and showed us how universal the power of music is, and these were cartoon characters who took a life of their own. In here, we are saddled with characters based on real people who are treated like cartoon characters, and it isn't even a parody.Skip it and look for Ms. Hudson's video.",5,2,5,6 January 2007
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," So Much Potential, So Moronic in The End
","I have to admit that a little personality goes a long way, and such is the case of a very likable cast endlessly running around in circles with one simple gimmick. I fail to understand what has possessed audiences and critics to say they enjoy this. To begin, the quality of the dialog and the crude language appear to take center stage. In between spurts of bad taste, we find some genuine emotions and get to enjoy the rapport between the principals. The rest of the time, we could be watching a remake of 'Porky's'. Way a minute! That only means the original is truly better than the remake...There are moments when it appears as if this will take off, but it never catches fire like 'The Wedding Crashers' did. There is no chemistry and good will left here. All jokes are moronic at best, and the writer tries for a cheap laugh the easy way, throwing in offensive language or visual gags, overdoing it most of the time.Waste of time...",5,5,10,5 September 2005
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Entertaining, Very Smart, and Thrilling
","One of the problems with the earliest Mission Impossible movies was that they appear to be too smart for their own good, and even when we liked the gimmicks and the car chases, we felt like we left out of the party. It was like they were just too good to let us in. When we watch thrillers, part of the excitement is that we sometimes know a crucial piece of information that the hero doesn't know, and we wish we could be there to help him out. 'Mission Impossible' pushes the set up even further when we are part of the thrills, riding along, enjoying every turn, guessing like the heroes, wondering who or what is real? Where is the next double crossing coming from? It's so good that we welcome the most overused trick in the series when it finally shows up because the ride has been amazing so far, and in order to make this entry work, we need to recharge Ethan's batteries, and we have to give him a suitable new partner who is as challenging as enticing, and why not put everyone in jeopardy with a villain who is not afraid to dispose of anyone whether they are being useful or not, if the situation requires.Once again, our favorite group of spies or agents are out loose and without much of the support they need, exposed to the enemy and classified as unwanted by their own boss. Things become even more convoluted when a group known as The Syndicate makes an appearance, and the question is whether this association is a real or a rumor. There is however, no time to waste because if the group is real, the consequences will be enormous.In comes a lethal new female agent whose loyalties are not clear at the beginning, as she as alluring as cobra with the complication that she also is able to cast quite a spell on Ethan and the audience. We want to see more of her regardless of who she's working with, and the part demands an actress who is beautiful, attractive, capable of doing some complicated physical work, and who can project intelligence to the point that we know she is at the top of her game in addition giving her character enough mystery to make us wonder what her game really is.So we follow both friend and foe, and our mystery lady throughout the world, with some incredible action pieces in London, Morocco, Vienna, and more. We never really know how things will turn out, but we get the full package, as Ethan has to endure some precarious turns inside a water tank, one very deathly motorcycle race, and a rather devious challenge in the last scenes of the film. To keep things even more interesting, there's an element of fun, and we see the different agents wink at us, or just give us a quick glance to suggest things could go just about every possible way, except the one we usually are dealt in this type of films.As I said before, no one will be disappointed by any of the action, and the actors are certainly in fine shape here, but the glue that holds everything together is the very clever script that keeps the action flowing non-stop, and adds much intelligence to a film that is about intelligence because in order to survive in this universe, you need to have courage and brains, and the ability to use your talents both with some careful planning, and being able to see the immediate and the whole picture. The film definitely pumps much needed energy back into a franchise that could have ended with the last film. It raises the expectations of the audience which makes the next challenge something to look forward to. Whatever happens, here is the formula, so study it, admire it, and most certainly, enjoy it.",10,1,4,2 August 2015
Jarhead," Bad
","In order for this film to succeed you need to have a cohesive center, an actor whose personality will draw you inside the character's soul, pull you inside the illogical nightmare unfolding in front of him, and somehow leave you wondering about human nature. Instead, we are dealt a pretty sterile number, resembling an MTV video but without the pizzaz that genre usually packs. Sadly, another one of those overrated character actors tries unsuccessfully to anchor the film and falls with a louder thud than the film itself.Peter Sargaard's smoldering personality and piercing eyes project the sarcasm and irony we know should be the heart of the film. However, he is not the heart or soul of the story. He is relegated to be a part of very talented supporting cast that shines at unexpected times. Jamie Fox gives his scenes the right touch, teasing us into believing this project will eventually catch fire.Finally, the pastiche is a mess, a soulless attempt to bring the perspective of every man into what happened during this period of our history. One word of advice to those who can still save the business: commanding personality, a great face, and a real star. This film lacks one of those. Otherwise why do we look at the heavens? Louis B. Mayer used to brag about having more stars in his studio than there were in heaven. He knew how to play the game. Hollywood has forgotten what it is like to create a bewitching movie. It becomes enamored of people who are perfectly capable in bit parts and suddenly are being pitched as movie stars. A rhinestone is not a real diamond.",4,1,4,5 November 2005
Dunkirk," It is Quite A Tragedy
","Technically the film is a wonder. Nolan put me in the middle of the experience. The punishment on my ears will need a couple of hours to subside. I've noticed some reviewers writing about the story. In still trying to figure out if there was any. There were plenty of disjointed scenes edited in such a way that it bother me more than the massacres on screen. In the end. I can't remember any other time I felt so lost at the end of a movie.There were some spectacular moments that makes me appreciate the quality of the special effects and the director's technical prowess. Unfortunately, what we get throughout is an exercise in fragmentation. With barely a thread of a story we can only say we feel as lost as the stranded soldiers hoping something would put us out of our misery as the constant barrage of explosions and foreign continued endlessly.Sadly, the film could have starred no one special as all the major talent keeps looking a way from the camera or is in the dark, facing down, or covered with oil. There is very little emotion here and we get the idea by default. The Nazis are very bad and guns kill.I do have to acknowledge the imaginative score by Zimmer, probably one of his beat giving us the promise of much better stuff to come but after the first 10 minutes, I felt as hopeless as the soldiers in Dunkirk. It is hard to care for anyone when there's so little given as background. Would it have killed Nolan to have ar least one complete character? Posing nobly waiting for the ultimate demise doesn't count. Maybe we will get him back to the heights of his Batman trilogy. Not everyone hits a home run every time.If you like fireworks you're in for a treat, otherwise prepare yourself for the longest day of your life.",4,15,27,21 July 2017
The Intouchables," Makes Your Heart Sing and Dance
","What a great film!!! It's going to very difficult to put into words what this film has achieved. Both Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy give perfect performances as a couple of men dealing with hardships and develop a very strong friendship in spite of their very different backgrounds.With the help of a sharp and insightful script, the two actors go through a series of incidents, learning to appreciate each other's values and grow closer because they understand each other and how difficult life can be. Where Phillipe is at a point in his life where he is ready to give up, Driss comes up with an alternative point of view, and it is his resolution not to wallow in self pity or treat others any differently that attracts Phillipe. Soon, Phillipe is enjoying life again, and he tries to correspond and do something for Driss, and the results will make your spirits soar.The film is rich with emotion, and Phillipe's party and Driss' treat scene are formidable cinema pieces where everything comes together, as the screen fills with music, song, dance, and some striking visuals.This film is a winner.",10,6,12,11 July 2012
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Superb
","Problems with books are that they inspire disappointing films.  For a change, magic is created from a book that defied adaptation.  The first two films based on the Harry Potter saga were mildly amusing, and we were glad we were given the opportunity to at least see what that magical world looked like.  They just didn't have the magic the prose of J.K. Rowlings had.  Now, Mr. Cuaron has created a darker and more beautiful interpretation of the third book, and this one contains every element the others lacked.  For once, our spirits soar and weep at the right moment.  Even the very short performances are given nuance and details to keep them in memory.This one doesn't feel like fluff, and with more maturing work by the three leads, especially the enchanting Ms. Watson, one can truly witness what a good director combined with the right source can do. This was a magical work of art which shows how amazing a film can be. It's truly one of the best films of the last two decades.On a side note to the person who wanted more humour from Mr. Cuaron, please reconsider the themes in this book, and go back to the film to see how much funnier this installment is, compared to the first two. There is plenty of visual gags and funnier elements here, but there is a time when more important and serious aspects had to be addressed, and here is the time to grow.  Just remember, growing up sometimes is painful.",10,0,0,6 June 2004
Ratatouille," True Inspiration: A Magical Treat
","Who would have believed a rat could be so charming? When the studios try so hard to put together a hero, they seem to ignore that it's the actions and the heart of the character that they have to work on, not the exterior. I shudder when I think of those animated creations that animators have developed and passed as 'cute and interesting'. The hero in 'Ratatouille' has been altered to make it likable, but he still looks like what it really is, and there is a moment, to the credit of the filmmakers when they acknowledge that the 'hero' is still a rat, and that having too many of its relatives in a food establishment will have serious consequences.Still what lives at the heart of this movie, is the story of the underachiever who finds his way into a world that might not be very welcoming. The star of the movie is the food that must be prepared and used for different situations to move the plot forward; the rest is some very effective support by a clever screenplay that treats us and its character with respect and that shows much love for the fine things in life. It is a joy to see how someone appreciates the ecstatic enjoyment of gourmet food, the pleasures of preparing it, and the satisfaction of doing a good job. Is the clear presentation of opposite sides of nature: the mediocre and the sublime, and the unexpected approaches that provide us with much delight.The film is gorgeous to look, and it sings loud and clear, from beginning to end, as it shows the quest of its two main characters to prove themselves in a very hostile environment. It has its heart in the right place, and it shows how wonderful life can be no matter who you are and where you happen to be.",10,1,2,12 November 2007
Bad Teacher," Cameron vs Lucy
","I can only imagine what this would have been like if the writers had been inspired enough to give these gifted ladies the material to have the match of the century. Diaz has already proved herself as a gifted comedian. She employs her witty delivery and couples it with some very funny physical turns. She is not afraid to take chances and handle some raunchy material; somehow taking a detached and naive approach. She was really wonderful in 'There's something about Mary' and 'The Mask', and I had great hopes for 'Bad Teacher'.The worst about the movie is the typical easy way out of the filmmakers, relying on some material that borders on the vulgar and tired. We understand Cameron's character is well, flawed. There is really not much of a need to use the language she uses, and the situations she becomes involved in. There is even more disappointment when one sees how much Lucy Punch is trying throughout the film, and she's genuinely funny, delivering bad line after bad line, with much gusto, sometimes even saving some of the material. There are moments when one can't believe how great she is, and whether her scenes belong in other movie.Of course, all of this takes place in a Middle School, what could have been an endless supply of types, situations, stereotypes, etc., etc. There are a couple of funny moments, and those are given away in the preview, leaving us with pretty much nothing to experience in the film. There is also Timberlake, who well, has much potential, but can't do much with his role.I would probably say this should have gone straight to video...",6,0,2,10 July 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," Other than that lizard... it's very good
","Great previews usually lead to great movies, and there's a fantastic preview right before 'Spidey'. When I first heard about Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone heading this cast, I thought that it would be amazing. This film's previews looked great. Here's finally, the end product, and it's for the most part a fantastic movie, and the only criticism that we can come up with is that too bad it wasn't perfect, that the villain was well, not up to the rest of the story. Originally, the fear was that it was too soon to remake it; then you hope some good writer is part of the package (Argent) comes in, and we can see his touch, giving each of the central stars juicy lines to make them real, interesting, and endearing.Andrew Garfield is the best thing that could have happened to the franchise. His eyes are full of wonder, inquiring, able to convey a myriad of emotions in seconds, and his genuine chemistry with Stone certainly makes us care about what could happen to either one. She is not a typical damsel-in-distress, and here's a hero who can shed a few tears in the right place without looking insincere or stupid. This is particularly important in the early scenes involving the incident with his uncle, and his yearning for his long-lost father.Yet the film is a lot of fun, specially in the learning stages of his newly-acquired powers, when he can't really understand what is happening to his body. 'Chronicle' did this effectively, but there was always an impending sense of doom. Here's only our expectations about how powerful he might become, which leads to the point of his nemesis, a terrific looking being that is well, not very threatening, particularly in this summer, full of some terrific antagonists.The special effects are fantastic, and New York hasn't looked this great in years. Watching Spiderman swing from building to building, and his little adventure in the sewer system of Gotham City is exciting. The best we can say is that here is another part that feels just right. If only Lizard Man's ego has been unleashed in the way that a few other egomaniacs have shown up recently. Remember the psychotic Joker, and that prince from another galaxy demanding respect from his 'new subjects'? I loved the claws, but if the best you can do is scratch people with it...? Back to Garfield's acting... This young man is one of the best things to come out of England/Hollywood recently. He can certainly carry a film and make it better and stronger than it might be. We want to continue seeing his adventures. Let's just give someone or something more terrifying and more threatening to go against next time.**** out *****.",8,24,33,8 July 2012
The Lego Movie," Way Overrated
","'The Lego Movie' carries with its name an association to instant likability. In fact, I have never played with the toys myself, but they look like fun, and I can't imagine a kid not falling in love with the possibility of building whatever they wish. The film, unfortunately, falls short because once again it does what Hollywood does best, lots of flash, with very little essence, soul or heart, though it wasn't for lack of trying.Here is an everyman put in the position of saving the Lego universe from the Mr. Business, I guess we're playing with extended metaphors and sarcasm here. I have seen situations and plot devices like these before, but the magic falls short here, quite quickly, after the introduction of the main characters. There is very little to captivate the audience with the very simple facial expressions of the characters. There is some magic in the shots that involve streets, freeways, and distant perspectives, but it is hard to engage our interest when we have close ups.So, after the first 15 minutes or so, you can start feeling how simple the whole enterprise appears, and it an almost palpable feelings how the different members in the audience are trying very hard to like the film. The little tykes are probably more interested in looking at the possibilities of what they can put together at home with the pieces they see in the screen. From this perspective, the movie is no more than a very long advertisement. The adults are glad the kids are quiet, but one can only laugh so much at the 'funny' lines.I was mostly impressed by the interesting conclusion, which could have easily turned off everyone in the audience, but it is a reflection of some of the most magical and/or sweetest moments in TV and cinema, the revelation that it's all a dream, but that it doesn't really matter. Things are pretty clever at that moment, and Will Ferrell, an actor that I find wooden and tiresome, doesn't do a bad job here. Maybe he is more effective when he is restrained.There are some creative moments, from the voice casting, to the catchy tune that is bound to sell a zillion copies to the unsuspecting audiences, and most incredibly, the cliffhanger for the unstoppable sequel. It was actually kind of cute. Hope the people behind this production do a better job giving us a warmer, better film. After all the eyes in CGI have come a long way from the dazed looks of 'The Polar Express', and they can do wonders with stop motion. Just look at the amazing work of Tim Burton and his films. There's hope after all.",3,7,17,23 February 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," It restores a piece of your soul
","A friend of mine told me today that the film had made quite an impact on him, and I couldn't agree with him anymore if I tried. It did move me quite a bit, too because it did something very few films are able to achieve: to tell a story with honesty, without flashy effects, distracting cinematography or editing tricks. This one focused on the story, the acting, and the message.Most of the credit should go to the two leading actors. Both Matthew and Jared are sensational, combining their drastic transformations to portray the characters as realistic as possible, but no make up or gimmickry would have worked if it hadn't been because these two gentlemen poured their souls into the project. They channeled the entire range of emotions that must have existed in those two extraordinary individuals. Both were flawed human beings who recognized their differences and similarities, who sought the best in the other, and who tried hard to make a difference while living under very difficult conditions.The story deals with a man who tries at first to come up with a way to survive, only to realize there is a market in the suffering of others, but unlike the establishment that he ends up fighting, he discovers his soul aches when he realizes that profits sometimes result in more pain or even death. He learns to understand that the differences in perception are the result of the environment we're raised in, that we will never understand the others unless we walk in their shoes. He also realizes that there is blood money involved, and that the money gods are indeed difficult to resist or conquer.Here is an extraordinary man who is given a month to get his affairs in order and ends up surviving nearly eight years, dealing with his own handicaps and all the other obstacles he encounters as he first saves himself, saves others, and tries to tell the world that there might be a way to stop many from dying, but this might prove to be too much of a battle.It is a moving story that will hit you hard because it hides very little. Rayon is a particularly heartbreaking character, with sad eyes that shine with hope, yet are clouded by the horrific realization that death is around the corner. His scene with his father is shattering, and his interactions with his partner will make believe that there is always room for hope and love. The story presents everyone without portraying anyone as special, perfect, but as real people with real problems and real pain.'Dallas Buyers Club' might start as a cynical and hard film to watch, but it does earn one's respect, admiration, and most importantly love. There is still hope for Hollywood to find real gems in the middle of the artificiality that we so often encounter.",10,7,12,7 December 2013
The Exorcist," As Good As It Gets
","William Friedklin directed this film in the early 1970's, and it was one of my earliest exposures to classic cinema. There is something that permeates the film from its early frames. It's cinemas at its purest form, with images telling and enhancing the story. If one can believe it, emotions are perfectly conveyed, and one is both a witness and a participant, almost being able to feel the protagonists' feelings, the temperature in the room, the psychological disturbances in the universe.This is a movie that couldn't have been made by another director. He connected to the material, whatever personal background or experiences helped him, we might never really understand, but in his hands, he fashioned an adaptation of a tale that was already controversial and which dealt with the primal forces of almost any culture. He gathered a remarkable team of actors and technicians, giving enough weight to every element, respecting his material, and allowing us to become an integral part of its success.As almost everyone knows the basic story of possession of a young girl in Washington, DC and how the event is just a step which leads to the reunion of two opposing forces, a priest and an old demon. In the middle is an innocent girl who opens a pathway to a dark world that nobody really understand but few want to be exposed to. It is complex, mysterious, challenging, threatening, stifling, devastating, and pretty scary. It feeds on our fears and anxiety, and it won't stop until it draws you into its realm.Faith is at its core, with the old guard, still strong enough to fight the powers of evil but losing the battle because of physical limitations. The new generation is also in shaky ground because faith is a commodity that is hard to maintain, to she must and modern life is corroding its foundations. A priest wants to believe, but he's having second thoughts and feels helpless as he can't assist himself and the ones he loves.The film builds its momentum as one's able to see how the evil forces will use every possible weakness to conquer the other. It's full of dark moments which involve theology, history, mysticism, faith, and the arrival of invasive technology. In one of its most upsetting moments we forget the old horror as the young protagonist must be subjected to a new kind of torture, and we can't help but recoil as we're witnesses to what she must endure while people find a possible solution to what is ruining her life.In the end, the film is as perfect as it gets, with Blair and Burstyn doing superb work as the mother and daughter in the center of the storm. Von Sydow and Karras also shine as the warriors who attempt to restore normalcy to the poor young girl's world. What makes the film so good is how it has kept so well, 40 years after its original release because of its solid writing, acting, and the technical achievements of a team that brought to life a text that was a force of its own.",10,1,1,29 December 2015
X-Men: Days of Future Past," So Good in Many Ways!!!!!
","Watching a movie can be plenty of fun. Seeing a good movie in a movie theater is an experience that is hard to beat, and having the opportunity to see a great film turn into a classic in front of your eyes is a pleasure that it is hard to match, and that is the case with this chapter in X-Men saga. It's an almost perfect film, a thrill to sit through, a perfect blend of technical and good writing. This film proves that quality is not equal to classical drama, but something that occurs when you have some very talented people working together and giving you the best they can.For starters, that marvelous cast, all of them in a perfect ensemble. Some taking care of the philosophy and the 'heavy' duty stuff that gives X-Men its soul. Here we have Magneto and Xavier struggling with a love affair and the future of their kind. Two beings who know they must find a way to walk the thin line that could turn them into monsters and ruin humanity's chances of survival. Then there is the team that they need to support and protect, and who can help maintain their safety on Earth. It pays to hire some of the best: Berry, Jackman, Fassbender, and a list that is too long to mention.Then we have one amazing piece of writing, weaving two time periods into a very tight story line that has the very difficult issue of time travel explored and played with in a very exciting manner. Bodies drops and destinies change in front of our eyes for better or worse. Nothing is simple, as we can see when Xavier and Magneto meet again, so to speak. Then there are those moments when all of these people are in the middle of a confrontation with their mortality, and we can see that we are really not that different from each other. Jackman just keeps getting better and better at making us forget how strong the soul of his character is. We know all of them struggle with the duality of their nature, but Wolverine makes it easier to understand that pain, and it doesn't hurt that he is very good at displaying his powers in action.My favorite part of the movie deals with its heart, and this is pretty much left in the hands of Lawrence, who has grown so much in front of our eyes in the last few years. She has fire in her performance, and we can see the passion, the determination, and the fear when trying to choose when it's o.k. to listen. I wonder about the choreography of her fights, and if she's involved, I am in awe.The story is basic. Wolverine must go back in time (his essence) anyway, and he has to find a way to stop a series of events to save both humans and mutants from a fate worse than death and/or death itself. The introductory scenes dazzle, as we see our heroes working in perfect unison trying to escape those machines that have been created in the past and now are exterminating every mutant they encounter. They are the perfect killing machines, and it's ironic that their source of power has originated from a mutant, too. In the beginning, things look pretty bad for everyone involved.The ride gets more exciting, as the trip to the past begins, and we are treated to another of the highlights of this fantastic piece of cinema, as we see that it takes an action film to really bring out some of the best in craftmanship. We see sets that blow our minds as we are literally, with the help of 3D and much creative talent to the 70's. 'American Hustle' was praised to heaven and had very little to offer. This film has huge sets, dazzling amounts of costumes, props to satisfy the biggest of cynics. Cars, drinks, furniture, hairdos, all perfectly integrated and propelling the story forward, without trying to be call attention to themselves by being too clever. Everything has a function here, and it's perfectly performed.In the end, there's only one small disappointment here, and it is the fact that it will be very difficult to match this film. Earlier in 2014, 'Captain America II' gave us a taste of what could be done when focus is regained, and this 'X-Men' entry proves that practice makes perfect, and that careful planning and execution can indeed result in miracles. I know they only give 10 stars here, but I could probably go for an even dozen.",10,1,3,29 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," It Shines Here and There
","There's no denying the visual effects in this film are outstanding. Not sure whether they will ever top some of the quality or the artful and dynamic editing that makes them so much fun. There's however, a hint of exhaustion here because walking in, I was thinking that we probably need a little break from 'The Avengers'. They're all over TV and this is the third Captain America in less than a decade, not bad if they were the only ones, but we had a few 'X-Men', and there's 'Batman'.The film really comes to life with the introduction and reintroduction of some familiar faces, and some really interesting new blood. 'Black Panther' approaches his hero with a primal force many lack. There's also plenty of fun in the new 'Spiderman', a real teen who is full enthusiasm and energy, but who hasn't learned to understand his role. It's fun to watch fawn all over some of the people he considers his idols.The film itself is a little too long, and it has a good plot, but it's stretched too thin. Here's the tale of revenge that was done beautifully in 'Star Trek' with Khan. There's the idea of an eye for an eye, revenge. Instead, we're treated to an endless number of scenes explaining why the whole thing happened. I was exhausted at the end of the movie and could wait a few years to see them again.Well, maybe it would be more fun if we see more of 'Ant Man', 'Spiderman', and 'Black Panther', and there's always time for 'Black Widow', but the moody and cerebral ones could take a little break and come back fresher in a decade or so.",6,7,15,25 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Not Much of the Potter Magic or Charm
","J.K. Rowling tries her attempt at recreating the magic of her previous creation, and the results are mixed. It is full of promises, but it doesn't have the same initial level of charisma and power the first 'Potter' movie had. Most of the same elements are there, but the overall feel is a bit flat. Maybe because we don't have the same contrast of innocence and impending doom we witnessed in the first of the 'Potter' novels. We dive straight into a new and earlier part of the same wonderful universe, full of incredible non-human creatures, each one beautifully designed, rendered very well with the latest technology. One can look into the various 'animals' and almost feel like there's a living soul there.Now, the main characters is a diverse bunch, with some very interesting and magical performances, Redmayne, Sudol, and Fogler raising the bar for whoever joins the sequels, and we definitely want to see them become permanent parts of the ensemble. One of the things that is missing is star power because we were treated to the best of the English actors in every one of the 'Potter' chapters, and there's very little of it here, until near the end of the film when Depp makes quite an entrance, hinting at darker forces and enemies to come next. If you're in for creepy looks, he, like Voldemort, delivers.Throughout the film, we have the problem that it feels as if the performances are too restrained, with very little of the sense of wonder we saw before. Fogler manages to bring some of that back, with a funny and sweet turn as the 'muggle' who can't believe what he is now seeing. The section of the film when he walks into the world of the suitcase is what we wish would spill over the rest of the film. The main danger in this film is a bit too ethereal, which has never worked well in fantasy films. If we don't have a good, tangible villain, the movie will be out of balance, and in spite of a quiet and intense turn by Ezra Miller and a very dark turn by Morton, it's a bit disappointing to see an unruly cloud, no matter how destructive as too intimidating.Maybe this whole film is a spring board for what is coming, and if we continue with the same level of quality that we witness in this production, and if we are treated to better developed characters, we will have a very enjoyable treat. Much praise goes to the world of the 20's, with all its ugly characteristics, every web, dusty surface, ragged outfit is there. It's a bit depressing, but is showcases some of the best work done by Atwood and her colleagues. It feels like a window into a world long gone, and this where some of the true cinematic magic lies. It's so real that it takes away from the illusion of magic this type of film requires.Overall, it's a couple of very entertaining hours, allowing us to feel like there are better things to come.",8,7,12,20 November 2016
Jackie," Inside Jackie's Head
","'Jackie' leaves a mark, yet it might not be what the film makers expected. It feels like a passionate project, with pretty impressive depictions of the era, with cinematography that gives you the feel of the era, or at times, a documentary, realistic look. This is a positive. Also, we have a remarkable movie score which is going to haunt you there and for days after you attend the film. The best part of the film is probably Portman's turn, a much better turn than the one in 'Black Swan'. Although she looks very little like the first lady, she conveys with much passion the turmoil and insecurities after the tragic day. To balance and put some light in the film, we're treated to a 'tour' of the White House, and how it became a type of Camelot while the Kennedy's lived there. Still, we see the film, understand, and appreciate it; however, I'm not sure that I really enjoyed the experience. I wasn't touched, as much as I was jolted by the recreation of that day, and there's very little subtlety in the film. After a while, we feel like we are being pounded, and we end up a bit drained.Natalie does a very good job with her intimate approach. She's intense and able to give us an idea of what it feels to be a public figure in good and bad times. She's after all a human being who was apparently a contradiction to herself. Since she appears to love the spotlight and benefits of the good times, it's quite a shock to learn that she doesn't want much of what comes with the position. When the reporter comes to learn about her point of view, she taunts him with lines and appears to know what he expects only to kill much of what he needs from her. Alternatively, breaking down and regaining her composure, we see her human side, and the manipulative touches that are not exactly something we expected. She's a smart woman, with professional ties to this reporter, and we wonder what her motivations are for sharing the experiences with him.For a while, I was deeply engaged by the film, but it started getting monotonous. It didn't lose any quality, but it remained a steady delivery of information, and it began to feel like a boring documentary. It was rescued by some particular moments when the leading actors brought back some intensity to the performances; however, it was not enough to invigorate it and give it the punch it needed.As a movie, it is a different portrayal of an event, something that has been discussed and analyzed quite a bit. The director managed to put together an artistic piece, a dark immersion into a sad time in history that aimed for more intimacy but never quite got there. In the end, it will be considered a good film. Whether it touched us, it is still debatable.",7,1,5,11 December 2016
Inside Out," A Beautiful Animated Movie That Will Baffle Children
","Pixar is very good at creating universes, and some of its entries are wonders to behold. I can't imagine animation without 'The Incredibles' exhilarating characters and adventures, the bittersweet characters in 'Up', and 'Finding Nemo' is pure magic. Here is 'Inside-Out' a very grown up movie that looks very cute and is certainly appeal to children, only to end up frustrating many in that audience as the mysteries of the mind are painstakingly portrayed in colorful detail. It's a film to admire but one that demands a lot from the audience regarding what age one might be. One thing is for sure, kids under the ages of six are bound to ask plenty of questions if they're mature enough. Otherwise, prepare to have chaos in the auditorium, as I experienced during my show.Tbe film is extremely analytical, very adult in its content and delivery. There is a very lengthy introduction, explaining to us what we are dealing with. Oh, yes, the emotions are shown as these very cute 'beings' that live inside our heads, controlling our thoughts, actions, and emotions. They also have a very interesting way of classifying our memories and experiences, and the film tries really hard to drive the point through.If one somehow manages to shut our audio receptors, to appreciate the wondrous animation, we have plenty to dazzle us visually, and unlike 'Toy Story' where tears were earned naturally, making us almost feel like we were watching real life performances, we saw the power of great story telling. In here, the film struggles between being an complex depiction of how our emotions originate and their effects on our lives, and we deal with so many symbols, it is difficult to really appreciate each of them. Oh yes, that childhood toy is a fantastic piece of animation, and I love its voice, but I can't put aside the film, which never stops feeling like an essay instead of a story, of a film, of a piece of movie magic that can both entertain and be intelligent. This one demands to be appreciated.One big problem with the film is that the cutesy aspect of the film grows tired pretty quickly, as we are very little to balance all the crisis everyone seems to be going through. I felt like everyone of the characters was eventually going to end up on the psychologist couch by the end of the film. I don't think I saw or heard anyone laughing at anything in the film. Oh yes, there was vocal acknowledgment of an event, but it was always an emotional burden.I would be very interested to see how this film plays through its theatrical run, and how it is appreciated in its later stages in home entertainment. Will it earn the love of the other Pixar films or be deemed just a cute animation experiment? It remains to be seen. There will be nominations at the end of the year, most likely in the writing and technical categories. We can already see how the great vocal talent will be dismissed again, and there might not be enough emotional buy in to go all the way to a Best Picture candidate. There is no Beast here, and the family angle here is almost secondary to the antics of the animation and the complexity of the subject matter.",8,4,25,20 June 2015
The Duchess," Powerful
","Fiennes has been a reliable actor since his breakthrough appearance in 'Schindler's List' a little more than a decade ago. His diabolical Nazi had a complex personality that transcended some of the stereotypical portrayals seen before. For most of last decade, he has continued shining with films like 'The English Patient' where his romantic sensibility permeates the entire movie. 'The Duchess' proves once again the caliber of his acting. Here, the technical details are flawless, but it is how he reaches into the soul of the character that dazzles us. He inhabits the role, bringing out every possible facet and detail. The portrayal of the duke leaves no room for doubt or questions. The man was the human embodiment of power, and he commanded respect and fear, never fully understanding how he had to make his moves. Yet he knew that handling this power could have enormous repercussions on his political, social, and personal lives, and the burden was at times unbearable. Fiennes shows this man had the ability to deal with, but he knew it was important to show that his actions and consequences did affect him, too.The movie is supposed to be a portrayal of the woman who married this iconic figure, and Knightley shows she keeps growing as an actress. It could be argued that Fiennes would need an acting partner who could do this magnificent dance with him, giving a performance that was solid and interesting. Knightley does just that, going beyond the costumes to explore how being a woman during this period was not an easy task, even when she had advantages that other members of her sex could only dream of. However, did she have the control she thought she had? This is the aspect the movie explores, and with both of these actors, it is possible to take a peek into this historical period.The film is elegant, gorgeously produced, with a lavish score that highlights the emotions of the main characters. Fiennes imposes plenty of restrictions on his actions because of the expectations society puts on him. Her other half is the emotive one and he knows he needs a partner like that, going beyond his initial design for his wife. They make an excellent couple and a great partnership. If only things were this easy...There is much to admire in this interesting recreation of a period and a society that has changed quite a bit. The best thing about the movie is again how wonderful Fiennes is, and how the film revolves around him, even though there is much to enjoy by watching Knightley bring the legendary woman to life. It ia all about what is being allowed during a period in time, about who is able to execute that power discreetly enough to retain the mystique, the respect and the necessary authority that has kept these people at the top of their elite. It is a delicate balance, and the film allows you some insight.It is a good movie, come, sit, and learn that not everything was pleasure for people like the duke and his wife.",Null,5,9,29 September 2008
No Country for Old Men," True Evil and Fate
","Watching how Bardem's character executes his role in this story is a full time job. It requires your attention and your emotional participation as you fear getting too close, but you can't avoid looking, even as we know what his mission is, and how horrid his actions can be.There is much more to this very good film, but at the very center of a disintegrating society is evil, and how it takes different shapes, pulling men into obsessive chases for money and possible escape from a miserable existence. There are very few opportunities to sit and ponder what is going on, as we know it already, and little by little, we are given several opportunities to see how the different participants eventually meet their fate.The directors/producers/writers have managed to develop a style where sometimes style took over substance, that not being the case anymore, as this time heart and soul are always present. We are fully aware of the plight of every person who has come into contact with the drug money. We might not support their goals, but we still feel for them, as the angel of death approaches. Bardem's character is a puzzle, one that we might might not want to put together, he is a very repulsive creation, one that performs a function without much of a heart. It is possible that he might never had one. He toys with his victims and shows outright disdain for them, giving them choices, much like an angry God would. Eventually he derives pleasure from what he does, and even when he loses in his game of chance, he knows he has tortured his victim just enough to scar them for life. Bardem's monster is truly impressive, as much of it is never explained to us. He keeps him human enough to show how truly evil he is. He is not a perfect executioner, as he encounters several bumpy moments along the road.Lee Jones is very interesting but remains secondary to the two people in the main conflict, as he watches and tries to become more involved in solving the situation, only to discover that his actions might not amount to anything fruitful. In the end, we see his frustrations as his life has been reduced to a domesticity that might be worse than facing Bardem's criminal. The worse thing is that such encounter would have been more rewarding than anything else that ever happened to him, and there is one moment in this story when we develop a bit of frustration, as we see that this might never happen.The ending is anti-climatic as we see that life doesn't necessarily follow the standards rule of a Hollywood movie. This film will not make everyone happy as much of what is expected never happens. The level of tension is heart stopping, and then, it never seems to have a pay off. There is a lesson to be learned, or is it just a lesson to be reviewed? It never quite explains itself.",9,1,12,12 November 2007
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Another Epic Adventure
","'The Hobbit' would be adapted into three, and everyone reacted as if it was a Satanic action. The truth is that the first installment was disappointing, especially in its first half. It did redeem itself later. The second installment proves to be a complete success if you look at it for what it is, a beautiful adaptation loosely based on the novel. Peter Jackson fixed everything that was wrong with the first one. He left out the long conversations, the unnecessary exposition, and he concentrated on what he does best: a wonderful action movie, full of breathtaking scenery, incredible art direction and costumes and one of the most memorable scores in the last few years.Our troop continues their quest to go back and take back their stolen loot and kingdom. Things won't be easy because they have the Orks chasing them, the Elves aren't exactly welcoming them, and Gandalf knows there is a bigger force behind everything that will eventually envelop the world in total darkness.It is impossible to discover the amazing direction by Jackson. Just get ready for incredible sword fights, one thrilling race down the river, the lighting archery work by Legolas and his kin, and if you don't have enough, there is very nasty dragon who doesn't appreciate being awakened by the greedy dwarfs.The magic continues, as spells as put forth, dwarfs are poisoned, and Smaug tries to stop the dwarfs from taking back what he has stolen. It is interesting to see events that happened before the trilogy because we can reflect on how these actions will affect the future. Ironically, the trilogy remains at the top, but this sequel in the prequel benefits from improvements on CGI and that terrific Howard Shore music score which brings every fight alive, and shows the good and bad in each of the character.One of the best films of the year.",10,6,13,3 January 2014
Batman Begins," bravo to his Royal Darkness
","So many times style rules over substance, leading us to true disappointment. For a change, Hollywood has taken the mythic tale of the dark crusader and made it into a truly satisfying movie-going experience. Bruce Wayne's dual-sided personality is finely detailed, with his evolution from a scared child to a superhero.The film explores issues of morality, vulnerability, loyalty, ethics, and more. With the help of an outstanding supporting cast, the story takes flight, allowing the audience to partake of both a fantastic array of amazing gadgets and special effects; yet the audience's emotional level never stops feeling real. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman prove themselves once again three of the finest contemporary actors.The film, however, belongs to Christian Bale, whose portrayal of the Dark Knights shows a range of emotions rarely seen in a film of this type.I'm glad someone finally got it right.",10,2,4,19 June 2005
Twilight," Faithful and Dazzling, Alluring and Impressive
","I read the novel by accident, recognizing immediately its themes and its audience, yet I couldn't stay away from its refreshing new angle. Taking a backseat to the love, passion, and mystery were horror and gore, and it was all from the point of view of a teenager. What made it different was the fact that such feelings do not change much when experienced by an older crowd, and though not fully recognized in the original source of every modern vampire film, they were now the centerpiece of the story. When I heard that it would become a film, I dreaded the results since now there is strong emphasis on the flash, not the substance, and where its detractors will say that this story has a weak center, I disagree because though its themes might not be recognized as 'important', they are universal and appealing to everyone who gives it a chance.It's difficult not be seduced by this dazzling adaptation of 'Twilight'. It showcases some of the most beautiful cinematography ever in a movie, adroitly complementing the cold passion at the heart of the story; it fits the color scheme of our protagonists: the main characters stand out for their pallor, their icy facades which strangely highlight the red of the lips and the gold of their irises. Their surroundings are always cloudy, giving the green of the foliage an intensity that keeps you remembering the forces at the heart of the story.In addition there is an amazing soundtrack highlighting the various emotions of the characters, from haunting to passionate, from delicate to erotic, from loneliness to full satisfaction. Rarely has a film been matched to music as carefully as this. When we are treated to the notes of 'Claire De Lune' and it envelops us, we know we are dealing with a special work of art.As if the handsome and perfect production values weren't enough, we are introduced to a couple of performers that will easily find super stardom in their respective professional careers. Both Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson glow and are absolutely loved by the camera. They fit the creations of the novel perfectly, and their performances are intense and flawless. We understand the complexity of the relationship, as these two people show us how easy is to be seduced by the powers in nature, and how terrifying the consequences might be. There is a fine line between humanity and our ties to the lower animals.'Twilight' is very entertaining considering its leisured pace, and this is another one of its qualities, what makes it special. This is a film directed by an assured hand by Catherine Hardwicke, a director who is not afraid to show the intelligence and sensibility in young people. She respects their nature, their angst, their perspective about what a strong connection means to them, and maybe to us. We were able to take a very realistic look at the world of teenagers in her movie 'Thirteen', and I wondered for a moment what Evan Rachel Wood could have done with the character of Bella, but it doesn't really matter because it there was ever a time where piece managed to fit perfectly, is in this film, an amazing achievement that will seduce its audience with its delight production, extraordinary acting, and perfect direction.Let yourself be seduced.",10,2,8,23 November 2008
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Simply Spectacular
","I wasn't expecting this film would this good. Somehow, I kept thinking stretching the material into three long films would lessen its magic, but when Peter Jackson directs, we know he will raise the bar.The opening scenes move a little slowly, and it's hard to keep track of who is who. There are hints of who will be central to the story, and the dinner scene muddles his introduction because of the 'festive and chaotic nature' of the guests. Once the party gets on their journey, things pick up, and we are treated to the gorgeous vistas, the superbly choreographed action and fantasy scenes, which are rarely equaled in cinema. Soon, we encounter all types of fantastic creatures, and we get to see familiar faces along the way. Much welcome is the magical entrance by Galadiel, beautifully played by Blanchett, one of the most versatile actors working now.The dwarfs' quest is to regain control of their land again, but there will be plenty of people/creatures/entities that might not be willing to cooperate or might even try to destroy them. Add to that, a long-going feud between two leaders, and the stakes are high. As Bilbo agrees to follow, he will also have his own personal challenges, and he will take possession of the mystical ring that will become center of the later trilogy. It's a fantastic scene, as we see how Bilbo grows before our eyes, and Gollum is introduced into the storyline. Once again, Serkis does a marvelous job bringing this troubled creature to life.The second half of the film has by far some of the best work Jackson has done. When the movie soars, it touches your soul and restores your faith in the power of motion pictures. There is a definite sense of wonder as we see universes imagined for our enjoyment, and computer work has become so sophisticated that all works seamlessly. It's a pleasure to see the adaptation of the novel, and it makes us look forward to the next chapters of this new trilogy.There might be a bit of restlessness in the audience at first, but don't despair because you will be rewarded in new and unexpected ways.",9,4,12,16 December 2012
Seabiscuit," left behind by more than a nose
","It is important for me to note that I did not read the source material used as basis for this film, and a good film certainly does not rely on its audience to be familiar with its source material.  'Seabiscuit' exemplifies what happens when what appears to be fail-proof material is mishandled.There are certainly problems when the 'documentary' breaks appear more interesting and deep than the main story.  For starters, the photographs used to show the state of the nation while this inspiring real story was happening are excellent, but they don't support the ordeals and triumphs of the horse and its supporting cast.  They distract because they appear more relevant and concrete.  It is hard to care for any characters whose disabilities or personal tragedies are constantly pounded into our consciousness.  The overused use of symbols to show the grief of a father (watch those birds burst from the foliage), the rather strange romantic interlude to show the jockey's view of the world, and the unbearable sensitivity that he appears to have with his constant references to high literature; as if this makes the material and his nature more special.Another thing that troubled me while watching the film is how the races are filmed.  It is mostly close ups, and badly framed ones.  When one sees the race, the excitement is derived from watching all its participants struggle with reaching the finish line (anyone remembers 'Ben Hur'.  There is constant cutting and the camera appears to be mounted on one of the horses (where's Steadycam when you need it?).Not all is wasted in this film.  Jeff Bridges reacts the best he can to some of the situation, and his magnanimity is demonstrated over and over and over by a rather stale remark.  McGuire doesn't acquit himself too well, looking miscast and rather one-dimensional, but it is Chris Cooper's quiet and insightful approach that raises the film from a total waste of time.  If only anyone had approached him and consulted him as to how to deal with material to make it transcendental.  When he quietly explores with a look and ponders how to help the horse, one wonders at what could have been. Unfortunately, most of the time people are gawking and overreacting at the wonders of 'Seabiscuit'.  Yes, the movie tells us to scream and support the underdog, maybe a little too loud.  This film does not respect its audience, it's a bit condescending.  At first, it might seem like an important and touching tribute to an American survivor, but I'd rather watch a sequel that does not pretend to be anything else, but 2 hours of fun.  'Seabiscuit' could have been a contender in the world of the Silver Screen.  Maybe someone will remake it and get it right... next time.",4,1,5,28 July 2003
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," An Exciting Ride
","Ethan is back with plenty of thrills, and this time the action comes fast, with few distractions and in some pretty exotic locations, from Russia to India, with a little side trip to the tallest building in Dubai.Just when you thought we couldn't have any more nuclear threats, one crazy fanatic is on way to start the last nuclear war, and it us up to our gang to stop those evil agents from launching the deadly missiles. As usual, there is not much depth to the background and characterization, but that is the not the main point. We're here so we can enjoy the technology, the gadgets, the stunt work, and there are many reasons to rejoice, as we see Cruise, Pegg, Retner, and the rest of the cast, engage in all type of risky actions to save the world. The scenes in Dubai will certainly have the audience catching their breath, as Ethan has to find his way in and out of many suites a few thousand feet above the ground.It is indeed one of the most entertaining times I had at the movies this year since this film works with a genre that several directors have managed to ruin. In here, the style is simple with the camera following our heroes through some wild car chases, a desert storm, and other unbelievable settings. Overall, there is very little opportunity to rest, and your blood pressure levels will remain high throughout the film.Get ready for a fun time at the movies again. Unlike the other films out there, this one shows that it's truly elementary, and keeping it simple sometimes does wonders for the magic of the movies.",9,2,5,19 December 2011
Revolutionary Road," What do these people really want?
","Winslett is such an impressive performer because she manages to convey a natural., yet confident tone to her performance. I have rarely seen anyone show pain, despair, and confusion with so much conviction, without calling attention to the technical details, as some of our most outstanding performers do. She never seems to be acting; if it is almost as watching a real person on screen, and this make the impact even more powerful.'Revolutionary Road' is a dark odyssey for both leads. It never really explains how the trap caught, or the level and origin of the dissatisfaction experienced by just everyone in the film. There are many unhappy people here, but the big tragedy is that of the Wheelers, a couple that seems who have everything, yet they seem to be desperate for a new dream, and reaching that dream is an impossible task because they don't truly know what is stifling them, or what they really want.It takes an insane man to reveal and voice their feelings, and this is the beauty of the way the story is told. Because a ruined mind/soul is the only voicing the tragic nature of everyone's pain; it's not heeded, and the impact of that scene just speeds up the descent into even more tragic developments.In the end, the film is touches us. Still our frustrations and reactions are still bothering us because we have not experienced any cathartic release. The ending is bound to upset the majority in the audience, as it destroys the illusion of a time that embodied perfection in society and simplicity in the home. It is as if we hate what we are discovered but are still fascinated by it. 'Blue Velvet' was an experiment, and it successfully opened the door, yet the souls of the freaks seem detached. In 'Revolutionary Road', the people seem normal, stuck in a pleasant and normal situation that has gone wrong, but it is just realistic enough to make us feel that it could happen to us, too.'Revolutionary Road' is a phenomenal and disturbing movie, a strong artistic plunge into a world that we know exists but we can't find the courage to deal with.",10,3,9,4 January 2009
Foxcatcher," What a Heavy Load These Demons Can Be
","Bennett Miller's previous attempt at a bio picture resulted in at best a frustrating outcome. I could never see past the miscasting of Hoffman in the lead role. You couldn't stop seeing his commendable attempts at capturing the soul of the writer, but it didn't come near the wonderful portrayal by Jones in 'Infamous'. Miller has done an impeccable job getting his three leads to capture the essence of the two brothers and the man who came in between them, tried to buy, steal, or use their talents in order to fulfill a deep and desperate craving for recognition, love, and respect.There are details that can probably enlighten us more about what was in the background of a man as mixed up as John du Pont. In my opinion, Carrell's portrayal makes it as real as possible. We can read the yearning for acceptance in his eyes, and his psychological baggage comes across in his facial expression shows loneliness, sadness, anger, frustration, and so much more. There is close attention to detail in the way each one of these characters move and walk, a simplicity in the way David and Mark move about. One wonders about how much Mark is capable of understanding about what is happening to and around him. He allows people in, responding to basic offering of love and support from his brother and John. Of course, each of these men have different motivations, and Mark eventually experiences confusion because he can't at times realize what is happening to him.Du Pont needs some talented athletes/wrestlers who can help him get a gold medal to show his mother and the world he's able to achieve something 'on his own'. We all know he's learned from his mother to buy whatever he wants, and his response when he doesn't get it is not much different from a spoiled boy. That is what makes the resolution inevitable and very scary because we have seen it all before. There are going to be some tantrum episodes, and money can truly make them grow exponentially.We see how du Pont reaches out to Mark, seduces him into believing he's got love and support, but he is unable to provide the same quality that his brother has been giving him for years. At this moment no one really understands what is going on, but we see there's a level of attraction between John and Mark. Is this physical? Is this a father/son bond? Is John just using Mark? When things don't go as expected, David is summoned, but there's no more trust between John and Mark, and Mark's professional future might be compromised. This will result in a negative outcome for all those involved because Mark, John, and David might never get what they really want.There is a strong sense of doom and sadness permeating the narrative. Even the smiles and happy moments feel threatened by the darkness in John's world. What is remarkable is how well Carrell captures this man and all the ugliness that is part of his life, and how this becomes toxic to all of those involved. Vanessa Redgrave, who is one superb actress comes in a few key scenes and shows the magnitude of her influence on her son. He makes a reference to her manipulations in his early years to satisfy his basic needs, and with a couple of looks she gives him, we know that there is no way he will be ever be or get what he wants or needs in his life. She just won't allow it because she's just never going to accept him for what he is.'Foxcatcher' is dark and powerful, real and involving because it shows three individuals who happen to share the same environment and somehow have a very difficult time connecting. In the perfect world, they should be able to reach for the stars, but the real world is not perfect, and they all succumb to the forces of the hell that surrounds them.",10,12,22,24 November 2014
It Follows," Who is it?
","It's refreshing to see a film where your brain is required to do a little thinking, well, maybe more than a little thinking. A young woman is haunted by an entity that might end up killing her if she doesn't get rid of it. We know the basics of what this entity is and what it could do? There are hints throughout the film that there might be more to it than just being another scary creation.Some people might think it stands for the effects and consequences of actions, especially when those involve violence or sex. It's obvious from what we are allowed to see that this how it's transmitted. Later, we discover that maybe the young man who explains whatever little knowledge he has, that this is not accurate. As we see that the entity just doesn't disappear as indicated. Also, it appears that it's not only haunting Jay, but it's felt by the people around her. This is where we begin to wonder.There are what some people might refer to as inconsistencies in the film, but I think they're purposefully placed there by the film's writer/director. There are homes and cars that would be better placed in an 80's location. There you have b/w TV sets all over the place, the dark brown and green sofas, and nothing that could bring you back to contemporary times, except for a clam 'e-reader'? Some of the clothes are a bit anachronistic, too, but we never know when we are dealing with a retro crowd. Then we see modern cars, cell-phones (in the first scene), and a very depressed bunch of people and surroundings.The way the film is directed we have a minimum intervention by adults. We see a profile here and there, or if we're lucky, a voice outside the screen. Then, there's the haunting soundtrack and the expert editing which takes you from one mood to another, back and forth, and keeps you thinking about what's going on because there is much to wonder about.The body count is not big, and if we pay attention there seems to a direct relationship between the entity and its victim, all very disturbing. We also have photos, cleverly placed to maybe provide clues as to what could be happening. Are we dealing with the results of action in the distant past? Are these souls in limbo? There seems to be a disconnect between the people who are closely affected by the entity and the rest of the neighborhood. It is as if they're not visible to them, but they are able to see reminders of what happened there. Much emphasis is placed on the decayed surroundings, abandoned buildings, hopeless attitude of some of the principal characters. In addition, we hear plenty of reminiscing between one of the couples. For a moment, I thought we were dealing with 'The Sixth Sense' universe, and to be prepared for a last minute revelation. However, there's the abrupt ending, but it's really that way? Or is it maybe just the end... of a cycle?Whatever the situation might be, the mood is right, the acting is very good, as the film reveals just enough to keep the mystery going, and the challenge alive. It's good to see that cinema can still entertain you, thrill you, and keep you engaged.",10,76,158,6 April 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Those Eyes!!!
","There is something about this movie that feels just right from its opening scene to the final frame. For starters it has a solid story, using as inspiration the original 'Planet of the Apes' movie/book. Slowly, but with enough suspense to keep the audience engaged, we are given the background information as to how the apes eventually became the rulers of our planet.Be warned, there will be at least a sequel, and if it's even close to this masterpiece, I'm already lining up for a ticket. John Lithgow, James Franco, and Andy Selkin do excellent work, in particular Franco as the scientist who manipulates science and technology in order to help humanity but ends up learning that playing God can have some serious consequences.Most of the story focuses on the development of Ceasar's background. We learn how his exposure to the darker side of some humans leads him to understand that the world he is a part of, might be a little prejudiced against his kind. Some of the scenes in the shelter are pretty disturbing, and you are bound to react accordingly.Eventually, the revolution begins, and things catch fire quickly, as Caesar organizes an army in order to find freedom and escape from his prison. This is the part of the movie that draws a huge gasp from the audience when we realize the way Caeasr has evolved, and when most of the special effects are going to blow the audience's expectations away. The film is tightly directed, with no a wasted frame. Elements of drama, science fiction, and even a bit of Greek tragedy are all present, leading the audience in a thrilling ride, showing us how effective good filmmaking is.Hopefully, this is the beginning of a great series, like Nolan did with his Batman, and the new 'Star Trek' series. As usual, respectable film groups might disagree, but this is movie making at its best, and I'm glad some people are still working hard to deliver.",Null,0,2,8 August 2011
Cars," Hand another one to the Gods of Publicity
","I've been a fan of Pixar for most of their releases. From the charming 'Finding Nemo', a film that proved that it is possible to have a heart in the middle of the newest technology, to the well-orchestrated action in 'The Incredibles', and the pathos in both 'Toy Story I' and 'Toy Story II'. It was possible to believe that screen writing still mattered in this institution, and then we have a major crash in 'Cars', a film that stands out because it is derivative, unimaginative, and possibly one of the most boring of its generation.There is still plenty of talent around the film, with both Owen Wilson and Paul Newman doing good work. Yet the color scheme is pretty dull, and the dialogue never sparkles. In fact, it feels contrived and annoying most of the time. It is an insult to those of us who are paying good money to be 'entertained'. During the screening I attended many children kept asking to go to the bathroom or were asking too many questions. This being a sure sign that the screen did less than hold their interest.There is another big fault with the film, and it is the design of its characters. They all have the same blank look, wit none of the emotions one did find in the previous Pixar animated films, plus it was very hard to believe that those cars in the movie really had the ability to be anything else but boring cars. They looked and behaved like cars.It is time that Pixar looks back at itself and keeps itself from falling into the same trap that most studios are finding themselves in: Let's concentrate on doing intelligent work and develop those ideas beyond the board room and the sales pitch. Audiences are bound to wake up, and it is not a good time to make these expensive faulty guesses.",2,9,27,13 June 2006
Gone Girl," It Must Be Cold in Hell
","David Fincher knows how to pick his choices for movies. He's gone from the nightmarish but brilliant 'Se7en', the puzzling 'The Game', and list goes on and on, but nothing will prepare you for the sharp portrayal by Rosalind Pike of the fantastic character that is the heart of 'Gone Girl'. Throughout the film, she shines, radiating this cool, cold beauty, matched only by the cold design of her intellect and the execution of the movie.At first, I thought having Affleck play her counterpart was one humongous mistake, but it actually works well because Affleck's range gives him enough room for us not believe that he can never be a match for her. It's obvious from the beginning that he is nothing else but another step on her way to something much bigger and better. Yes, there are a few seconds when we think it is possible to up her game, but if that were to happen, it would feel like cheating. It's nature game that it's the survival of the fittest, and if he is to make it, it's not going to be her choice. In fact, I think it's pretty courageous of Fincher that the film ends the way it does.Everyone involved in the film is fantastic since they're not afraid to show their flaws, their doubts, the fact that it's after all, a cold and unsympathetic world. We never root for anyone because we're surrounded by vultures, ready to prey on the leftover of the other vultures. Children are nowhere to be seen, except for a couple of shots where they hurriedly leave the scene. If anything, they are weapons to trap and destroy your opponent or worse, they're to be used in order achieve bigger goals.A man soon becomes the presumed guilty party in the disappearance of his wife, a woman who is seen by many as a stranger and difference creature. She is after all, from New York, and this is a small town where affairs happen, but murder is just something else. The rope gets tighter and tighter, and we have no other expectations that the mystery will be solved and Affleck will get his due. Before the deal is done, the first of the unexpected turns happens, and designs change because of fate. Here is where everything we think is coming takes a completely different spin, but the tone and the mood remains.This is where the cool beauty of Pike gives way to her cool mind, and things become uglier as we discover what is really going, and how she is one of the most resourceful people here. It becomes clear that it would take a miracle to upset the natural order of things, and the realization is not how it will end, just bad the ending will be.I overheard some people walking out of the theater expressing disappointment, but that only made me realize, how well the resolution is executed because this is after a work of art that has taken plenty of chances both in its written source and the translation to the cinema. Unlike 'Tattoo' where emotional involvement went subzero in its American adaptation, this one maintains its rotten heart beating quite strongly. There is not much affection or happiness involved. This is not a movie about love, but a movie about how dark human nature can be. There is very little bloodshed because even the big scene is meticulously executed, almost begging to be admired rather than for shocking purposes. Sharon Stone's character in 'Basic Instinct' would be a mere apprentice if she hanged around the characters in this movie.Behind the camera and in absolute control is Fincher who manages to give Missouri and the Mississippi a cold, gray and steely look and feel that has probably not been seen before. It's an incisive look at how humans really behave when the fantasies of love go away for whatever reason that might be.",10,4,18,2 October 2014
Django Unchained," A Little Too Much
","Let me make it clear. I did enjoy most of it, but I also found myself looking at my watch and hoping it would end sooner. If there was a film this year that more than deserves the adjective excessive, this is it. It's a decent film, with plenty of action, some very funny scenes, and three of the best performances of the year: Jackson's house slave is almost as good as Washington's performance. He's an interesting and complex character, somehow who we can't even imagine existed. He's the darker twin of Scarlet's mammy in 'GWTW', way darker and just as fascinating. There's of course, another star turn by De Caprio, puzzling, magnetic, depraved, and ruthless, and Waltz creates another memorable character, a foreigner who can't comprehend what's going on in his world, but who doesn't stop from taking advantage of the situation without losing his soul.'Django' is a hybrid of Westerns? and a very strange take on slavery, looking at it through Tarantino's special lens. He's unable to edit himself, and while he builds the tension and almost never loses our interest through Django and Schultz quest to rescue their 'lost princess', I kept wondering why he overindulges all the time. Things don't clash here, they explode with such magnitude that I was wondering why wasn't 3-D involved in the process. I kept looking for guts flying and what happened to the NC-17 rating.There is much praise to give to the fact that he takes risks with his use of language, and there is not a boring conversation in the entire film, but when there is confrontation, you almost feel like ducking or you'll be hit by some of the flying organs. Much of the praise here should go to the way the Old West comes alive with the costumes and art direction. There is also the amazing job Robert Richardson does with his camera, making the film look and feel like one of those Spaghetti Westerns he's paying tribute to. I loved the way he brings in Franco (the original Django) and interacts with this movie's hero. There's of course, some Ennio Morricone, and a few other touches that show Tarantino's adoration of the genre.Is there a story? Well, barely. A lot of the film is about the feel of it, like getting on a ride without expecting much depth, and to be fair, there shouldn't be a IQ test or some confusing plot twist to ruin the entertainment, but I think Spielberg knew how to control himself in 'Saving Private Ryan' by limiting the massacres to the first 20 minutes. A little restraint would have helped here. Who knows? Tarantino might have achieved his masterpiece.Another detail that is puzzling me. We're hearing all this praise for the movie, like it's the second coming of Peckinpah or the latest collaboration between Benton, Penn, and Carpenter. It's as much fun as the best '60's B movie, but I am not sure about those accolades out there. Where was all this praise for the 'Indiana Jones' films? Maybe they should have included more flying body parts and some more colorful language? Still enjoy it for what it is... a ride that has plenty of movie syrup in it.",6,118,217,31 December 2012
Get Out," Most nerve wrecking movies in years
","Living in a world full of remakes and turns that might get too !such praise because there's very little to inspire and make the audience gasp. When the real thing comes about, one wants to relish it, embrace it, savor it. 'Get Out' has it, showing it from its introduction to the last frame. There's no wasted second here. We are surrounded, line the protagonist with a threatening and stifling atmosphere. With the stirring and spooky soundtrack that enhances perfectly a fresh take on the trapped prey. The movie works because of the various talents involved. Nothing distracts because of its perfect balance. Eyes convey fear, much surprise, emptiness, signs that something is very wrong and things can get really ugly. Revealing anything beyond the premise in the trailers that show our protagonist will be facing racism of a very strange And evil type. There are a lot of dark forces at work, some embodied and projected with terrifying gusto by the actress portraying a cold professional with a heart of steel and the coldest eyes one is bound to see this year.Will he escape? Who are these freaks behind the peaceful and welcoming facades? What motivates their actions? Go and see the ways work in an almost perfect thriller that really scares and thrills and makes its audience jump and clap in all the right places.",10,7,19,26 February 2017
Drive," Style and Power = Gosling
","Going along for the ride will take the audience through some tense and stylish moments. The players are just stock characters one has seen before; yet two manage to stand out. Gosling's mysterious driver, a man who has apparently seen quite a bit and has developed nerves of steel, without sacrificing his soul. On the flip side is the ruthless head of a crime 'family', a vicious man who executes a crime without second thoughts, tolerance, or respect for human life. All that matters to both of them is to achieve their respective goals.The entire film appears to exist somewhere between Lynch's surreal universe and the Noir netherworld of the 40's; yet this one carries quite a punch because there is nothing subtle in it. People feel love, anger, betrayal, and a core of basic emotions. Much of the narrative is spent as we observe a character slowly considering his options, without allowing us much insight into who they are, where they come from, and where the ride might take us. The camera loves both the strength that propels both Brooks and Gosling as it register in their faces. There are no wasted words or moments here. Things start, brew, and eventually explode.Much will be said about the violence in some scenes, as heads are literally turn into mush in many ways, and the witnesses to the incidents freeze in disbelief, and so do we. The film will leave an impression on you because of various particular pieces, particular the car chases and a couple of executions.There is much to like here, but it also demands much from the audience, and if we give it our time, we will be rewarded, so go along and enjoy the drive.",Null,1,8,18 September 2011
Insidious," Truly Scary Tale
","'Insidious' raised the bar high for future directors of 'scary' movies. James Wan keeps that camera on people long enough to see and understand their feelings. He also knows that too much sometimes is just too much. It's the quiet and the suspense that freaks us out because we just don't know when something or someone is about to strike. A comatose child, garbled static, concerned and irritated adults... they all add up to us forgetting it's a tale of possession and the supernatural. We become invested in the future of these people and the ultimate fate of the young boy.It's always dark in just about every scene, with people both on and off the screen straining to see if we can believe our eyes. Ghosts appear, threaten us, leave enough clues so we can't doubt the reality of their existence, but what is worse than knowing others might just think we are crazy?Byrne and Wilson are very effective as the afflicted parents. They're young, and the film's believability factor increases because they look like modern people who wouldn't be acting irrational unless something bad and special would be truly be invading their lives. I like how so little time is wasted in dialogue and much depends on their reactions to all the supernatural happenings. The film actually picks up steam as they move to a new house, and things just happen to get worse.So well put together is the movie that I could ignore how much it borrows from other movies, from the rocking horse, to the marks left behind by others, to the anachronistic music and the appearances of the mysterious children. It doesn't matter because we have a good director putting it together, and veterans like Hershey providing support.Enjoy the transformation, the decline of reason and the futility of what we always thought would work, and don't despair, there's plenty of originality, too, and everything works when the mood is just right.",9,0,0,5 January 2016
The Theory of Everything," All The Pieces Fall into Place
","Jones and Redmayne, what a couple. I was kept thinking that it had been a while since we had such a perfect match in the movies, and it was specially a treat to have this kind of chemistry with two people who are not stars/celebrities, taking away from the material, plus the fact that they are both wonderful performers, and it couldn't get any better with a great job done by the director and his team. What a perfect universe and what a treat for us.Hawkins and his wife, the story. It all begins in Cambridge, as two plain but smart and sensitive people fall for each other. Not sure what liberties were taking with the real people's personalities, but it's refreshing to see a film that concentrates on the wonders of falling for each other, and it's simple, perfect, organic. It doesn't take away from giving us enough to understand each of their personalities, and there's no big drama, except for the eventual introduction of the muscular deterioration, but every element is worked around the relationship between these two very special people, a man who revolutionized the world of Physics, and a woman who couldn't be more different from him if we had concentrated on philosophical or theological angles. These two don't let two matters derail their emotions, and it's not that they live in a perfect world, or that they are in a perfect relationship. It would be a boring story otherwise.Hawkins health deteriorates, and the prognosis is not good. He's give a couple of years to live, and this is enough to kill a budding relationship, but one hasn't counted on the strength and the level of the attraction between him and his future bride. They marry, have kids, support each other, and eventually encounter a few bumps on the road, and things get interesting.As previously stated, they have a 'normal' relationship where they care and love each other, and there is a strong core because their relationship is based on genuine affection and friendship. They undergo a period of intense stress, as it becomes obvious that she needs help, support, and she is after all, an academic. All of the attention is on him and his achievements and handicap. Her life is on the verge of falling apart, until Jonathan shows up, and to put it mildly, it does complicates things a little because a bond established between her and him, and unexpectedly between Hawkins and him.One has to remember that things are bound to change, that the universe has rules, and this applies to relationships, too. The Hawkins stand by each other, but they are not invulnerable, and eventually more chemical reactions happen, and life changes. New people come in, some unions change, partners change, and life moves on. What doesn't change in this film is the emotional pull it possesses, and the audience is bewitched by its power, as we continue admiring the beautiful work done by this team. I was a bit hesitant at first because there were comparisons to 'My Left Foot', but the work here is more subtle, and the emphasis is not on the physical acting (though it's quite impressive). Instead more is done with lines, with looks, with more subtle approaches. One can almost hear the heartbeats, the power of a sigh, expressing desire, love, or frustration.The backgrounds and the technical work is impeccable and helps the overall effect. This is a work of art where nothing gimmicky deters from the main idea. Yes, we see a very special man, with a very special mind, but most of all, we see the human being and his wife, his passions, the fact that his thirst for knowledge might originate from something truly special inside of him. I can't explain otherwise how he landed such a wonderfully spiritual partner. The film ends with a strong emphasis on the word 'hope'. He hoped for more than a couple of years, and his life went on for a lot longer. We only hope that most people who yearn for something as wondrous as some of the stuff we see here, have their dreams come true because unlike this film, life is hardly perfect.",10,12,19,29 November 2014
Frozen," Quite Good!
","Though not as inventive or as gorgeous as the fantastic 'Rise of The Guardians', an animated film that didn't get as much recognition as it deserved, 'Frozen' is way up there, especially after a couple of years that hasn't shown much in the way of storytelling. Films have been impressive in their presentation, but their tales have been, to say the least, a bit thin.Going back to sources that are close to 'The Little Mermaid', is no coincidence that 'Frozen' (loosely based on 'The Ice Queen') gives us quite a charming film. The music is good, not on the level of 'Mermaid', but good enough to support the film, to hum along with it, and is a good match to some gorgeous visuals, and three or four animated characters. I was particular impressed by Olaf and the two sisters, especially the Ice Queen, who had more depth, both in its animated portrayal and personality.The story tells us of the conflicts brought upon a pair of sisters, as one has the gift/curse of transforming her surroundings into a deadly combination of beauty and cold. People will admire the transformation but will also shiver because of the fairly realistic presentation of the power and harshness of this type of environment.An accident separates two sisters who love each other, and on the day of the older sister's coronation, an emotional outburst sets off one tragedy after another. Soon, the hero/heroine must find a way to bring everything back to normal; however it is pretty clear that it won't be an easy task, and most importantly, things are not always what they seem. The main idea here is that beauty is dangerous in one way or another.'Frozen' is piece full of wonders, strikingly beautiful and with the ability to connect in many levels with both children and adults. We will all love Olaf and his innocence, will understand the need to restore the broken bond between the sisters, and will also yearn for the love that everyone wants in their lives.The film is very good.",9,2,5,7 December 2013
2012," A total disaster
","It must be said that it will be hard to top the scenes where L.A. disappears because of the catastrophic events in the thin plot line. If only, someone had decided to put the care that went into the visuals, revising, editing, and maybe writing some good lines. It's possible. As we have seen before in the 'Star Wars' films, many other action films, and even some of the many sources of inspiration for this project, there is more to a good film than just a lot of CGI.Watching John Cusack play action hero is always a thrill, especially when the poor man doesn't have much to say, and we have always appreciated him for being able to speak in more than monosyllables and present the most trivial of events and dialogue in quite a sophisticated manner. He's a thinking actor. In here, he benefits from the fact that we are always distracted by the disaster that is either happening or is about to hit the screen.It's amusing to see how much could actually fit in '2012' and somehow we were not completely exhausted by the end of the movie. I thought the iceberg was a little too much, but the crowds were happy...The film is not boring, but it's just a bit too much, after all a thrilling ride is exciting, but how much can we expect from a total disaster? from the end of the world? and did anyone catch how those people got on board. It doesn't give us much to hope for if anything like that ever happens.",5,1,1,26 November 2009
Peaceful Warrior," Remarkable and Truly Inspiring
","I had seen this movie come and go a few weeks ago. Suddenly, it came back, along with some interesting talk about it. I'm glad I saw it and strongly recommend it to everyone out there. Be warned, it will require that you concentrate and pay attention to its message. There are no hidden agendas here; it simply demands that you look at yourself, dispose of all the extra baggage that you carry and focus on the present to make the best of it.There are questions about how it all came together, and what some of the symbols mean. For instance, who is the old man? Is he a God like figure, or personalized intuition? Why did our young protagonist get a chance that others didn't? Where does faith lie in the middle of the drama? It probably doesn't really matter since the message remains the same: It's time to put a little more effort and truly go after what you really want.The young man in the film just happens to be an athlete who gets a second chance and blows it! Still, there is more to be discovered and pursued. In fact, it might not all be over. I loved the way 'Socrates' interacts with his disciple, slowly teaching him the ways of knowledge and meditation, leading him yet not enabling and influencing his choices, allowing him to learn from his own observations and mistakes. In short, teaching him to believe in himself, yet never diluting the impact of the process, painful as it might be.The film moves very well, and there are moments when we are not quite sure what we are witnessing. It's spiritual, or is it paranormal? Is it a tale of faith, a ghost story, a love story, a tale of reckless youth. Whatever it might be, it's truly inspiring and soul searching. It will probably help a few members of the audience reflect on what is going on with themselves and the world around them, and how much power we truly exert on our destinies or chose not to have? There are inspiring films, and there are gems like these: movies that are entertaining, soulful, full of feeling, intelligence, and not in any manner condesending and obtuse. This is a film that trusts its audience and encourages them to search whatever, specific truth, they might be needing.A classic.",10,2,4,1 April 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," The Last Stand?
","There are so many definitive moments in this film that the title appears to fit, and before forgetting, I advice you not to leave the theater until the lights are on and the credits over.Once again, the mutants versus the humans. Prejudice at its worst is making life miserable for the mutants, and now the cure takes on a really dark tone because it essentially validates the point of view of many who see different as bad and something wrong. Add to the central plot point, that Magneto and Xavier are still pretty much clashing with each other, though the film establishes early on that they do understand each other's different natures.All of the mutants are back, and this time there is no denying that each actor is fully able to handle each character's nuances very well. Halle Berry acquits herself beautifully with her performance as the ultimate weather freak. Then we have Hugh Jackman, throwing all of his Shakesperean training behind one of the most emotional moments of the year. Here is a man who is not afraid or unable to show emotions: a true cinematic hero in my book. Ms. Jansenn is formidable as the most powerful of them, a force of nature who can certainly cause more damage than anyone can predict.There are many wonderful moments in the film, and they make the film very enjoyable. In addition to the clever storyline, there are special effects in this film that need to be seen and recognized for they're flawless and amazing.Enjoy the 'Last Stand', because it might be just that... or could it be?",9,7,14,28 May 2006
Room," It's Room, It's Home
","Watching 'Room' is an intense experience for it's the story of a woman (ma) who fights for the survival of her child, the one source of happiness and strength in a very limited world, a place that could have killed her long ago. At first, we see the interaction between mother and Jack. Through the eyes of a very gifted director, we are able to almost feel their hearts beating, how their souls are almost like one. He depends on her completely because it's all he has known. She has insulated him from pain and created a world inside their prison. He's happy, and that sustains her. It's what makes her endure the visits of her kidnapper. She has become one with the child, but one day she realizes he will grow up, and this place will not be sufficient for either, especially for him. Jack is a bright and inquisitive young boy. He has learned to read, and he is beginning to wonder. She knows it won't take long for his soul to break because he's like her, a part of her: a sensitive soul that needs to grow and develop. There's much love here, but there's plenty of sadness and horror, too.One day, she fashions a plan to secure his freedom, and at first, it's not good enough, but with a modification, it succeeds, and this is barely the first half of the film because unlike other stories and film makers who take the easy road and simplify the dilemma or the problems of the main characters, this film has taken us to the edge of the precipice, and if you thought the life in the room was hell, things are about to really intensify.Transitioning into normalcy is not as simple as it's in the fairy tales, and just like Larson and Tremblay have already proved themselves as accomplished actors, their performances become even more exquisite in the second half of the story. We got to know them as they spoke about the world. We knew how simple their existence was, how controlled, and how dangerous it was, too. We became part of their world, and now as the doors of freedom are open, we begin a long road to adjustment. It is not easy. It might have more pain than we realized.Most people are happy to see Ma (Joy), but Jack represents many things to others. For those with a big heart, he's a bright and scared little boy who will most likely be o.k. after a while. It's the immediate family who have the toughest time since the transition is sudden and very emotional. Joy's mother tries the hardest, and it's a good thing she's around. Others experience a myriad of feelings which will affect both Jack and his mother. Her prison has changed her, and her expectations don't quite match her perceptions. It's at this moment that I was so impressed by Tremball's performance, which is better than most of this year's praised performances, adult or otherwise. He communicates his emotions through body gestures, glances, strong lonely yearning with his eyes, as he goes through the new trauma the big world has for him.It's a long and painful road, but it has a good resolution, one that feels real and universal, one that doesn't rely in long speeches, beautiful photography or any sort of overblown productions. This is as heartfelt as they come, giving us another reason to believe that we haven't forgotten to be human.",10,2,7,16 January 2016
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Stiller's Big Holiday Present to Us
","From the moment the previews showed up a few months ago, I knew we had a special film, and the whole feeling was reinforced when very little changed in the trailers as the movie's debut was around the corner. There was a feeling of expectation and exhilaration by the visual glimpses about Mitty's quest. He was looking for a dream, and we wanted to go along for the ride.The story is a complete delight, with a conclusion that will have your spirit soaring. Walter Mitty literally dreams all the time, spacing out during crucial moments, as if he's avoiding facing reality. What becomes apparent from the beginning is that he's one of us, and that he wins us over right away, as he at a crucial moment in his professional and emotional life. He needs to complete a very important task at work, employment which he might lose at any time, and since deadlines are tight, he must also confront two key decisions as soon as possible.He's had a special and professional relationship with a star photographer, who apparently thinks highly of Mitty, and things becoming complicated, forcing Mitty to travel all over the world to find the photographer and a very special photograph/negative. Walter Mitty soon finds himself in a world very different from what he has experienced so far. He grows in many ways, lets himself live every moment, and through Stiller's inspired camera-work, we experience every amazing moment with him. We are able to see and feel the wonder of being in such remote locations as Greensland, Iceland, the Himalayas, and everywhere he goes. There is comedy here, but it is of a very special kind. It is funny because it lightens and empowers the soul. Watching him show his skater tricks, the thrill of a bicycle race, climbing a mountain, swimming with sharks. It has been done before, but we somehow feel like we are part of the wonder.There are all these epic moments, as we see Walter discover so much more in the world, and it is the quiet moments that take over as the movie reaches its amazing conclusion. His eventual meeting with Penn, and the last ten minutes of the moment are powerful in ways we have seen in previous classics like 'It's a Wonderful Life', 'E.T.', and some of those movies that make you feel the wonder in life. In a world of digital 'wonders', we see a movie that tells you that there is nothing if there is no connection to the heart or the soul or whatever makes us special. When Mitty finally sees what the special photograph is, it'll be challenging to not to feel something jump inside your chest and you experience tears of joy because of the powerful moment.'Mitty' deserves recognition and admiration for it is a good film, with a solid set of performances, an inspiring and refreshing story, much more cinematic than anything this year. It doesn't need foul language to make us laugh, or idiocy of any time to appeal to all of us. It certainly boasts some of the most amazing cinematography of the year, and it has arguably the biggest heart in anything released this year.Five out of five hearts.",10,2,5,29 December 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," excellent adaptation
","In regards to the previous of those people who hated the film, this is NOT a literal adaptation of the story.  It's an adaptation which concentrates on character development, continues to show a masterful command of the medium with its stunning photography, brisk editing, and quite wonderful special effects.  It's NOT a real tale, but based on real human qualities and flaws. By the way, 'The Godfather' is good, but it's not REAL, either. By the way, movies are supposed to entertain and teach us a few things, and some of us should try a little harder to do just that. If you like the book better, that's your option.  Some of us like to keep open minds and enjoy things for what they are.",10,0,0,25 December 2002
The Mist," Darabont and King Might Have Just Made The Perfect Horror Film
","Darabont and Stephen King joined forces together and landed at #2 in the list of the top 250 films of all time in this website, and that other movie constantly shows up in many of the most admired and beloved films ever. Subsequent films haven't been of the same quality, but their latest collaboration is certainly as close to a masterpiece as anything that came out in 2007. This is a film that others will have to be measured against.Here is a film that strikes a perfect balance between the graphic and special effects elements with an insightful, philosophical, and incisive look at the complexities of human nature when confronted with its deepest fears. A small town in the state of Maine is suddenly enveloped by a mysterious mist, an element that hides something that could be highly dangerous and might harbor the final apocalyptic moments of the human race. Darabont builds the tension from the opening moments of the film, as he introduces a freak storm that is a harbinger of more horrific things to come. He is in firm control of his camera and his crew, as the odds are stacked against the people of this city. They have found refuge in a small supermarket and are as safe as they can be for the time being, but tensions are brewing within the group, and little by little religious fanatics and pragmatists find that there is a very thin line between sanity and madness.This is when this movie truly takes off, the exchanges between actors of the caliber of Marcia Gay Harden, a woman who is a zealot and truly thinks what is happening is a sign the end is near. Before we know it, she has whipped the crowd into a frenzy that produces devastating results. On the other side, the group led by Thomas Jane is finding that actions just have to be taken soon, or the end will truly be near.Watching Gay Harden's character descend into the very logical madness she believes is truly frightening, even more frightening than the creatures King has managed to conjure this time out. The effects are used sparingly and are very effective, as the monsters come out at key times in the film, striking the humans down and festering whatever strength they might have.In the end, and the end of this film is truly apocalyptic in its intensity and message, we might be led to think that hope lies somewhere at the end of the road, but watching the measures taken by man when facing the end is indeed devastating. Getting to this very emotional conclusion is an exhausting and rewarding journey; experience the cathartic moment will wipe the audience of whatever resistance they could still have. All of this is accomplished by Darabont's excellent direction, and a very haunting score by Mark Isham, a musical genius whom we don't get a chance to hear very often.There are a few original moments in 'The Mist', but we have seen a lot of it before, and hopefully detractors will admire the fact that Darabont has paid tribute to some of the finest films ever made in this amazing film. You will gasp even more as you recognize classic references to 'Alien', 'The Thing', 'The Fog', 'Children of Men', 'Poltergeist' and a few others horror films.It is truly my hope that the members of the critic unions and the people who award that standard of quality for film-making look beyond their preconceptions of the themes that should be recognized at the end of the year. Here is a very intelligent and insightful movie that forces to look inside of what believe, or what we are, and what might eventually become when faced with the truth. The beauty and the power of the word is very evident here, as is the use of light and shadow to portray the demons that we all fears, and of course, the film manages to utilize the talents of their actors to create feelings and images that otherwise would be just average and taken into the realm of the sublime.'The Mist' is a great movie!",10,7,16,1 December 2007
The Bourne Legacy," Exciting and Renner is a Good Lead
","The Bourne films are entertaining, having Damon as a lead lends depth to the mysterious agents. This time Jeremy Renner gives us a more visceral force, and though he's not Superman, he certainly demonstrates that his abilities are special.In this entry Renner is facing extermination, and he is survival mode for most of the story. Mostly, he is on his own. For the second half of the story he teams up with Dr. Shearing (Weisz), one of the people behind the project who finds herself facing death because of her association to Cross and other agents.There are some thrilling scenes in the film; some remind us of the tension in Alaska, a place where beauty and danger seem to exist harmoniously, and it doesn't hurt to have a computer-operated drone to raise the tension levels for a couple of the super soldiers.We visit a few worldwide locations as Col Byer (Norton) expects a clean resolution to his orders. Norton matches Renner in the intensity scale, though his role is different as he represents authority and is ready to justify the means in order to achieve his goals. Everyone of his words drips with authority, arrogance, and there is no room for interpretation or argument.The final part of the movie has some exciting chases in the heart of Manila, as we see Cross try to escape one very surprising, last-minute adversary, who might prove to be his match. It is in this part that the direction weakens a little because executing this type of scene must be very difficult. It is not bad at all, but there are moments when the editing falters a little bit, and that might weaken the overall effect of this confrontation. The best thing about the film is that it leaves us with a taste for more proving the fact that as long as there is charisma and talent involved, combined with a hero and a villain that are almost equal matches, we do care about what happens up in the screen.",8,4,9,12 August 2012
22 Jump Street," Chemistry of the Best Kind!!!
","When I was about to give up on modern comedies, here comes a sequel that outdoes the original ten times or more. Tatum is excellent as the slowest of the pair, proving he's a very good comedian, both physically and delivering some of the funniest lines in the movie, and his partner, Hill, redeems himself from the depths of 'Wolf' with a turn that shows how talented he can be. His multidimensional geek fully forms a perfect whole with the physical and sweet jock turn by Tatum.Before we can catch our breaths, the leads are back in school, this time in college trying to stop the viral distribution of a new drug. We all know how it will turn out, but the set up is to put these two in an environment where they will not fit because of the obvious. Hill, well spins his character in a different dimension and takes on a romantic and bromantic persona. His romance and break up scenes rank way up there with the zaniness of 'Some Like it Hot', and we are not prepared even in the more open times for some of the exchanges between the two actors when every other lines has a double meaning. This is classic comedy. In particular, the scene in the psychologist office had the audience laugh out loud because absolutely no one on screen was tuned to the same channel, and it kept getting funnier and funnier. For a moment, I thought I was watching 'Tootsie' and some of its best bits when the main character was having a nightmarish experience. This time, Hill and Tatum do an amazing job by taking their bromance into new levels.Tatum is definitely having the time of his life, as he finds his soul mate in school and apparently his destiny in life. Here he is living his dream, succeeding at every possible endeavor, being popular, sharing every moment with his newly found friend. This is serious competition for his undercover buddy, and the writers take flight with it when we see the reactions in Hill's face and their further exchanges.The silly action scenes and the vulgarity that peppers and ruins much of what they call comedy nowadays take a second seat to the development of characters here. We're not sitting listening to boring expositions or innumerable descriptions of bathroom humor. Yes, those elements are carefully placed, and what comes out is the silliness, the naivete and stupidity of how the characters deal with their relationships with each other. What might have been vulgar in another film, here ranks with some of the best comedy in the movies. There are many tributes and references to those films throughout '22'. Be ready to acknowledge the talents of Allen, Benny H., and a few others as winks are given to the audience. This might not be highbrow comedy, but it is beautifully delivered. Much of the credit once again goes to the incredible work by Tatum and the fine support Hill gives him. You will be laughing out loud over and over.There is one scene that has the explosion of a parent in a visitation day, and Ice Cub's outburst is one of the funniest ever on film. His rantings and reactions to a sudden realization about something one of his undercover agents has done was a moment to treasure because of his excellent timing and the rest of the cast's facial reactions. Whoever wrote the screenplay did his homework and made sure that the skeleton didn't go in without every other element to make a fantastic comedy. So many times we have been given trash, full of unnecessary and stupid jokes that are more shocking than funny. The recent 'Neighbors' being a prime example of everything that can go wrong with miscasting, misfired lines, and lazy direction.To close, there is beauty in all kinds of art. We have incredible harmonies in rock and heavy metal anthems. Class and perfection doesn't only occur in historical and pretentious comedies. Those are bound to be disappointments because they appeal to people who think only a particular type of productions should be considered fine entertainment. Some of the classics surprised us because we didn't expect much at first, but we felt pleased, entertained, and we were moved with the depth of what lied behind the the facade. '22' is a whole piece to be savored and enjoyed, and to laugh out loud, too.HAVE FUN!!!!",10,23,39,14 June 2014
Cars 2," Where did the Pixar magic go?
","Technically the film is flawless. Seeing the film one can't help admiring the progress CGI has made over the last decade, and the use of 3-D is not bad throughout the movie. You'd think that when Pixar's admirable staff couples with its obvious technical advantage, they'd be hit the bullseye again, and... the results are borderline disastrous.There is a great premise here. Actually, a few premises that go nowhere because there is just too much happening, but it is all muddled as we try to keep up with a spy plot that is nothing but uninvolving, as it is herd to tell the good guys from the bad guys, and then we have the simpleton stuck in the middle of it, the fish out of water, the friendship angle, and all the cute stuff that might have been added in order to bring some charm here, or maybe it was just there because they could afford it.It is a constant gabfest, and even the wondrous visuals feel bogged down as we have to constant to an endless series of conversations that are neither amusing, dramatic or clever, just way too long and at best flat. Pixar works best when the drama is clear, personal, simple. Who can forget the amazing personalities of the trio in 'Up'. The characters don't have to be people, look at Kevin and Dug. The family in 'The Incredibles', and many more come to mind. There is just something forced about the characters in this film. They're underdeveloped, and we're supposed to like them. It's even more detrimental when the opening short has the fantastic characters from 'Toy Store' take on a faux vacation and squeeze every possible laugh out of the short.It is at least disappointing, and well, there is always an annual offering by Pixar, and next year's should be much better. Hopefully.",3,1,2,10 July 2011
Ghostbusters," It's Murray's Party
","'Ghostbusters' has a place in our heart because it's silly entertainment, the kind that we looked forward to seeing when we were children. We loved ghosts stories and special effects that scared us just enough, nothing with gore and slashers. Just an old fashioned time when we had fun looking at ectoplasm and enjoying the heroes' adventures when they tried to solve the problem. It was comedy with special effects, and 'Ghostbusters' works for the most part.Yes, the effects are a bit cheesy. Maybe they're meant to be that way, and it's got an innocent feel to it. The ultimate monster is a marshmallow man that will destroy civilization as we know it. One's worst fate is to be slimed or turned into a dog, and it's a lot of fun most of the time, but it could have used more Bill Murray and more editing to give us a better experience.Most of the joy is seeing all that talent in the screen. Bill Murray's dry approach is just a delight. Everything from his one-liners, his gestures, and his exchanges with Sigourney Weaver who is truly a sport while sparring with him, growing to like him as the film progresses, and Rick Moranis plays his nerdy part so well, it's hard not to start laughing every time he jumps in the scene. Everyone else does well, but the three standouts are the ones mentioned before.NYC is threatened by a surge in supernatural activity, and soon references such as the key master are thrown around. It's all very simple. People are possessed, bureaucracy makes mistakes and our heroes get to save the world. One goes to see the film to have a good time.",7,3,3,31 August 2014
Gran Torino," Another one of Eastwood's Great Works
","I started wondering if there is a more consistent filmmaker working in Hollywood now, someone who can be held to the highest standards and who achieves his goals in a more graceful and flawless manner. For the last decade, Eastwood has delivered one amazing film after another. Most couldn't believe that he could top 'Mystic River', 'Million Dollar Baby', and others along the way. Then in 2007, he comes up with two fantastic movies, and 'Gran Torino' once again defies expectations and proves he is one of our best directors.It's amazing to see how this man can be both behind and in front of the camera and with his nonsense style, is able to direct a story that touches both our hearts and our minds and put together a performance that is a great achievement on his own regardless of the fact that the star is also in charge of the entire project, too.'Torino' explores the relationships between generations and members of different cultures, including representatives of various ages and origins, using language that once would have been considered ruthlessly cheap and derivative, but here because of a tight and insightful screenplay serves its purpose well. 'Torino' walks a tightrope, through a mine field of potential problems and backlashes and wraps up its very emotional story in one of the most satisfying endings ever in a movie.Walter is a character who has seen his shares of changes and somehow has built an apparently satisfying world for himself and his family. However because of experiences that are eventually revealed, his existence has not been perfect, and in his later years, he manages to find ways to redeem himself, help himself, and others.'Torino' is a hopeful film, a lesson in how humans grow and can aim for better futures, lives, relationships by showing us how sometimes it helps to give each other a hand, putting preconceptions and prejudices behind; yet not forgetting that transitions are bound to difficult and bumpy.One of the most amazing elements in the film is Eastwood's solid turn as the man who must learn to find a reason to live again, even when this can only be done through the most unexpected ways. His Walter is captivating, dynamic, powerful, and moving, one classic role that is bound to be remembered for years to come.",10,2,6,19 December 2008
The Hurt Locker," Plenty of explosive noise and situations, but
","There is a misunderstanding than having a message is 3/4 of the entire product. In most situations, engaged and intelligent audiences expect some type of emotional link to the theme in the movie. Most of us love recommendations, and many a film has benefited from incredible word of mouth when it had been previously dismissed or ignored by either critics or studios, and many classics were born. In fact, this is a situation that occurs more often than one realizes. Movies like 'The Breakfast Club' are proof of that. The problem is when the opposite occurs and suddenly the hype is so intense that one can't help but feeling confused as to what could be missing from what the screen shows.'The Hurt Locket' has some impressive scenes, some camera-work that a few would believe resembles cinema verite, more documentary style than feature presentation. There is also a very impressive performance by the lead actor, who should be credited with doing wonders with his limited screenplay, one that demands too much from an audience, who seems to be disconnected from the drama in the screen, full of shocking situations, but so devoid of emotion and drama. For a while, I was wondering if it was because there is so little depiction of non military faces; most of the times the camera was focused on the soldiers, and true, most of the perspective should be theirs, but it is like having a good piece of steak without any good seasoning.We're literally bombarded with horrifying situation after situation, but we never leave our state of numbness. Here is selfishly addicted human being who seeks instant highs from a job that many would rather die than perform. In fact, I think in the end that might be the message of the film, that it is all irrational, and that people like the central figure of the film is what perpetuates the tragic conflicts.We have suicide sacrifices, night holocausts, one of the dullest chases in history, a face off with a mysterious taxi driver. All of these intense moments fail, and one is only disturbed when the camera strays from the soldiers and takes a quick glance at those people who might be the most dangerous element of all. This is where the movie flounders, when there is so little emphasis on showing the two sides of the mix. One just doesn't work without the other.There are some very effective moments, one of them has our antihero facing a DVD salesman, and it is an opportunity that is not fully utilized because once again because we really never know what his involvement might have been. In fact, as he departs the story, we get into a household, and tension skyrockets because we finally have a potential exchange of points of view, and it all degenerates into a comical escape from an upset housewife.This is a film so out of kilter that it is the quiet moments that impact the most and will probably be the ones we will remember. We know war is irrational, that it might lead to even worse outcomes than most believe, but we have seen enough of the violence, the hardware, the testosterone moments before. This is like having a perfectly good musical piece ruined because someone believes that having every possible instrument play simultaneously will make a bigger impact. It is not the case. There has to be a balance, and the only thing hurting at the end of this film is the fact our intelligence has been insulted again by a group of people who can't see beyond the fog, the dust, or hear anything beyond the noise. Go back and see what the best moments were in war films, those when the noise disappeared and we looked straight into the eyes of those who were in hell. Screaming never made anyone feel, it just made us look.",5,3,9,9 January 2010
X-Men: Apocalypse," Coming Back with a Mission
","After ending half-frustrated by the latest entries involving my favourite super heroes, it's good to see that someone in Hollywood hasn't forgotten how to put together a great comic book action film. With the Oscar Isaac providing a solid center for the ultimate mutant/villain, this side of Voldemort, we have a troop of very talented people making return appearances, some promising newcomers who are more than welcomed to return in the newer entries, and my hat off to the fact that we have one screenwriter, keeping the vision focused, and the action tight despite the story going on for quite a while. It is commendable that it's a very long movie and not two parts, a trend that turned many of us cold.Here is one intimidating villain, one that could easily destroy just about anything crossing him or in front of him. His origins are unclear, but he/it appears to be powerful enough to run a tight ship back in the golden days of Egypt. He has positioned himself as the supreme 'God' and is apparently in the midst of a renewal/recharging cycle when a little coup-d-etat manages to recover the freedom for that civilization, and in a quieter, subtler note, it appears to lead to its decline and that of the entire world.Isaac's villain is a marvelous and intriguing creation for he is no angel and no demon either, and he has more human qualities than many human themselves. He is also very centered in what he wants and needs, and his plans are precise from the beginning. He needs to rebuild his empire and seeks the best of the mutants to achieve his goals. He is also generous in providing them with the energy and support they need so they can do a good job. His choices are interesting, and he knows how to appeal to them. It is at this moment that we wonder what his true nature is.He comes close enough to achieve what he sought to do because he's a great commander. His presence is enough to rattle a few nerves and inspire fear even in the most powerful of his adversaries. It helps him that some of the mutants are not sure on how to use their gifts, and it takes several tries and some confidence building situations to make them take charge.In the end, the day is saved by an unexpected presence, and one of the most satisfying qualities of the film is that these teams work as real teams, providing each other with the strategies and tactics as needed. There is very little display of ego or emotional trauma. It's a dirty war, and it has to be fought to the end. Prepare yourselves for a great roller coaster ride and be sure that the X-Men are coming back with something even more exciting next time.",10,7,16,29 May 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Perfect Wreck
","I was ready to give five out of ten stars, and then these people couldn't have done worse!!! There goes one of the reasons one goes to see these movie, and let me tell you: It's not any of the scatterbrained villains they came up with this time. I haven't seen a sorriest trio. There is not an ounce of personality, an attempt to give anyone of them any qualities worth mentioning. It's all flash, aimless technology, the fanciest of elements all thrown together, with no sense of intelligence or direction.Parker is back, perky as ever in his alter ego, enjoying every minute of his job as the webbed superhero. His personal life is running into several problems, as he thinks Gwen shouldn't be exposed to anymore of his adventures. His guilt is too much of a burden, and in addition to that, there are family problems by way of his scientist father.This film makes mistake after mistake by not focusing on what's important, not understanding the genre and its evolution. Just recently, 'Captain America' and 'Thor' have produced sequels which hold on to some of their best elements and engage with more complex themes. We're not expecting 'All The President's Men' here, but we want to be entertained because the villains are scary, powerful and worthy challengers. What we get is a half baked bunch of ideas which appear to fizzle before their plot resolutions, and in a desperate attempt to pump some life into the DOA film, a character is sacrificed, and the choice couldn't be worse. Oh yes, it's the most intense moment of the film, and it breaks our hearts because it's about the only thing in the movie that has any resonance. I remember when Spock loses his mother and almost loses Kirk in the latest reincarnations of 'Star Trek'. The moments are memorable, and the films never stop dazzling in their takes of the genre. Here, we almost wish the film became quieter, and we would have Romeo and Juliet instead. Sadly, we're left with a bunch of empty tin cans, and three villains that have neither enough inside or outside. They don't look or act like anything that will be remembered.There's some snappy editing, and Spidey still glides, jumps, and summer saults with plenty of class throughout Manhattan. His chemistry in and out of his suit is amazing with his real life partner. One of the greatest moments in the movie has him delivering a message to her, and watching them have a little 'domestic' dispute before he goes to defend us poor mortals, we can see this is the perfect team: She's the brains, he's the muscle. And the scatterbrained team behind this film goes and destroys this amazing team.There's an inspirational moment as Spidey recovers his will to fight and protect, but once again, the film crashes and severely burns with one of the worst endings in movie history, a stupid and pathetic one if there ever was one. We have seen revengeful dragons, backstabbing gods, and the impending doom of science gone awry in in recent months. The end of this film is begging Hollywood to kill this franchise because like Spidey, we might not have reason to live anymore.R.I.P.",3,19,54,4 May 2014
Ex Machina," It Might Sound Familiar and Yet Get Ready to Be Pleasantly Surprised
","Everyone knows what happens when man plays God? Apparently, we haven't learned our lesson from watching this happen over and over, and sometimes the problem appears to be solved. Mostly, it is disaster. 'Ex- Machina' presents a new twist on an old story.A scientist and a young man get involved in an experiment to see when machines are able to gain consciousness and are able to learn, feel, and a variety of feelings which might not be the best humanity can offer. At first, it's perfectly obvious who is in control, and it's a terrifying portrayal by Isaac, who looking both intense physically and psychologically seems to be able to manipulate technology, emotions, in every way necessary. We go in with the idea that nothing will escape this man, and that the experiment will have a tragic ending for everyone around him.Soon we get to meet AVA and she's a fascinating piece of work, cold and detached at first, an amazing technological computer with enough latex to show her gender but enough displayed to remind you of her origins. Little by little, she appears to be programmed to lead the young scientist into a very confusing psychological trip. He is being manipulated by both the creator and his creation, or is it by him only? Isaac always is in control, even when he is drunk. He has designed the environment, set the rules, and he's after all a genius.Matters become complicated when the three characters begin to do peculiar things. The race is on, and it is difficult to gauge who has the lead. By the time we get to the end of the story, everything is even more confusing, until the last ten minutes when we realize that manipulation was at the heart of the situation, and that most everything is explained, but we still wonder.So God creates beings in his own image and then makes sure than he retains the upper hand. We have seen this theme in recent movies like 'Prometheus' when an entire race is deemed unworthy of survival, and the travelers need to eliminate every trace of them. There are enough pieces of the puzzle around in 'Ex-Machina' to give us clues, but the mystery and the philosophy are two sides of the same coin, and as I said before, it could go either way.'Ex-Machine' explores what being human is. What separates us from other beings. Who made us? Did we evolve on our own? Is there such as a thing as evolution? Mechanical or otherwise? What is the future of technology? 'Star Trek' has explored this issue before, and characters such as Data make you wonder. In this film something magical is achieved as we are given a drama full of emotional twists, where we see machines behaving like humans, and humans turning into machines, or is it what we just saw or heard?***** out of *****.",10,8,14,26 April 2015
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Beauty and The Beasts
","'New Moon' is the type of film that would appear immune to reviews and close scrutiny; however this adaptation is probably one of the best tributes to its original source, and the sources that might have inspired by Meyer. It holds up pretty well, with the story of the tragic and romantic liaison between the seemingly broody, but otherwise normal Bella, a girl who just won't quit in her quest to be with the love of her life, even if that means breaking a few hearts as she gets there. She is intriguing, intelligent, impulsive, and a bit reckless, the perfect character to appeal to young people. Then there is Edward, the lovesick vampire who doesn't know how to fix the various threats to their relationship.They do have a few problems, a vengeful and powerful female vampire, the possibility of an all-out war with some impressive werewolves, one of which has a personal score to settle, and then there are those Italian beings, one of which appears to find Bella mystifying enough to keep her alive.I quite enjoyed the couple of unexpected twists, the way the sequels have been set up, and most of all the emotional shading Weitz has brought to the tale. When the change of directors was announced, I thought the formula had been ruined, but just like the Potters' latest entries, this has been a breath of fresh air.Much credit should be given to the three leads who bring each character to life, showing nuances missing from the characters' development in the story. Stewart broods with enough conviction to make us belief her emotional involvement is quite special, and Pattinson embodies angst and hopelessness like very few actors, and the most welcome surprise is Lautner's tortured and broken-hearted werewolf, a worthy opponent and contender for Bella's heart.The film is quite good and very enjoyable.",9,2,12,27 November 2009
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," This film is Fantastic!!!
","When the first film was over, I was disappointed because I wanted MORE!, feeling cheated that this cool quartet of super heroes had done their job, and the credits rolled... kind like 'The Sopranos', without the hype. Here is the sequel, and this film rocks! Mr. Fantastic and the troupe are back, with their powers, their very distinct personalities, and plenty of charm, ready to save the world, showing how a team works, like a true family.Best part of the movie is everything, from its impeccable special effects, demonstrating how special effect technology keeps improving, and how a simple story, when well developed and acted can produce chills down people's spines. While I'm seating in the audience, the children were reactions varied from: 'that was bad' to 'awesome, awesome, awesome...', and the best tribute to any of these films, 'that wasn't boring at all, much better than....' The film moves quickly and in a very dynamic manner, giving us enough to understand its plot, giving us more insights into each of the characters' background and personalities, not overburdening anyone with unnecessary pathos and too much drama. Although the dying scene did bring a couple of tears to my eyes.'Fantastic Four' works because it respects its audience and doesn't pander to us, giving us something that might look impressive in a treatment, but it's poorly executed. The cast is first rate, and it shows, and now on to the introduction of a new classic character: The Silver Surfer. This dude is blazing hot, as played by Doug Jones and rendered by the top notch CGI team behind the film. It's not just a showcase for the amount of money spent on the film, but a valid, powerful, and interesting new addition to the world of action/SFX cinema. Here's an ambiguous figure that gives something to fear and wonder, a power that used properly can be the best that could ever happen to humans; otherwise it's a valid fear.Dr. Doom is back, with his insidious nature, ready to outsmart our heroes and gives us a little trouble. Not a minute wasted here.Run and ride the terrific silver wave! This is so far and without a doubt the best action summer film so far, the contenders are not even on the same league. Hollywood does learn its lessons!",10,23,39,17 June 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Fincher's Masterpiece Blend of Craft and Emotions
","David Fincher has been one of the most impressive directors of the last decades, switching genres with an ease impossible to many of other overrated directors who chose safe themes and approaches. His latest is probably the closest he comes to a standard epic drama, but there is very little that is standard about this gorgeous, impressive, and very moving film.Fincher follows the rather special life of Benjamin Button, a man born looking like he is in his eighties, who finds his way to the loving arms of Queenie, a woman who will raise with the tender and selfless she seems to dispense so naturally. Their scenes together are likely not to leave a dry eye in the house. One can almost feel the love on the screen. As Benjamin grows older, he encounters a series of special characters and discovers that a full life requires understanding and sacrifices, regardless of whether the process is chronologically correct.He encounters people who make a mark on his life, and each incident is highly valued by Benjamin, stressing the positive over the negative. He understands some people shape us and our destiny, and we must learn to appreciate their contributions. As the epic continues, he discovers love, sex, courage, the irrationality of some events in every person's life, and as the center of the story, one very special person, who will be his loved one until the day he dies.It's wonderful to see how Fincher hits the right notes and uses a marvelous musical score, some of the most breathtaking cinematography of the year. Yet, in order to turn this from just an ordinary tale to a masterpiece, he must rely on the acting of all the participants, in particular, Swinton, Pitt, Blanchett, and the superb Taraji P. Henson. These performers convey depth and complexity with simple looks, their work more difficult to carry out because of the extended amounts of make up and special effects.Watching Pitt grow older, yet become older could have been a very distracting gimmick, but the maturity and intensity of his performance carry the film easily; his various scenes with Henson, as mentioned before are the emotional core of the character, shaping his eventual relationships with the other women, particularly the one who will become the love of his life, and will eventually be at his deathbed.'Button' is an amazing work of art, a movie that seldom is made because it requires dedication, vision, an understanding of the beauty that surrounds us and exists inside of us. Some people call it a showcase for the power to impress others with technology, as I see it, 'Button' employs our technological advances to put together magical imagery that enhances the inspiration, imagination, and the hard work put together by people like Fincher and Roth and their flawless cast.'Button' is the diamond at the top of a year that has given us its share of jewels.",10,2,5,28 December 2008
Lincoln," Daniel and Lincoln
","Watching this extraordinary film a second time, it confirms my belief that a great/good/excellent film will only improve with age and reward you enormously. Unlike other contemporaries, it's easier to enjoy and admire every single bit of the study of Lincoln's last weeks. The story deals with remarkable political maneuvers that took place in order to pass the Anti-Slavery Amendment. What makes the film different from the typical political biography is the way it incorporates the intimate moments of his family life, and how it is affected by the historical events that are destroying the nation.Armed with an army of very talented performers, led by Daniel Day Lewis at his best, Spielberg restrains himself and lets the erudite screenplay take flight. Impeccable art direction and costume design help recreate the era. Michael Khan and John Williams are also on hand to give us a fluid film that is rich and alive, with every conversation being a joy to behold, and when it reaches its climax during the final vote scene, one wouldn't expect to feel such a thrill, but it is unavoidable when there is a director of such caliber. This film couldn't be any further from a big action blockbuster, but the audience's reaction is about the same: pure exhilaration.Some of the joys here involve just about any scenes with Day-Lewis because he doesn't appear to be acting but channeling the man himself. He presents a full human being, with both emotional and physical loads, endowed with sensibility and guile and able to envision what the multiple consequences of his actions could be. There is one scene when he weighs the various alternatives and puts on his lawyer hat to evaluate his next move, and it's a marvelous option to understand such a special historical figure.Tommy Lee Jones, as the cranky politician is not far behind as he also knows the way things must be done in order to retain the respects of his followers and manipulate the ultimate compilation of votes. Sally Fields is effective as the emotional and scarred wife who has a big investment in the ultimate passage of the amendment because the current political situation had direct effects on her family. Equally good are the rest of the supporting casts, which includes names such as James Spader, John Hawkes, John Straitharn, and Hal Holbrook.Overall, the film works as a drama and a historical retelling. We might never know its accuracy, but its soul is there, along with a direct message about how Lincoln saved this country and made indelible contributions to the history of the world.",10,4,9,19 November 2012
Children of Men," Cuaron and his portrayal of hell on Earth
","It is seldom when you see a movie and call it a classic the first time out. This remark is not necessarily referring to something innovative and original, but it is a clear appreciation of how seldom we see a master at work, and here is Mr. Cuaron giving us another example of his remarkable directing abilities. He has already given us 'A Little Princess', 'Y Tu Mama Tambien', and one of the better Harry Potter entries, and this time he turns visionary and presents us with a visionary masterwork to make us think about the consequences of our actions.The film is not preachy and overacted, and it certainly works beautifully because of Cuaron's command of the camera and his reliable cast. In truth, the cast does very well under his direction, but one can almost sense any other good actor would have been if guided by Cuaron. Cuaron's film moves quickly, never faltering and calling too much attention to a particular aspect. It just depicts a horrible, not too distant future, and it benefits from having technology that allows Cuaron to fully express his vision.The entire film is bleak, and most people will be captivated and might be repulsed by the images, but it is never average. It delivers what it is supposed its themes and images. The last third of the film will envelop you with its sounds and capture your spirit, as it shows that hell is something we are fully capable of creating.The film ends abruptly and this might upset a few. It is sort of an ambiguous ending, and we can only rely on the power of optimism and faith to put the rest of it together. It is a tribute to Cuaron that we don't feel critical, only thankful we have gotten this far, and we are still hungry for more.",10,1,4,7 January 2007
Million Dollar Baby," exquisite and delicate work of art
","Usually there is so much hoopla surrounding films that come at the end of the year, and 80% of them are disappointing when they finally screen. Some of them flying by in colorful shells with technical wizardry but little emotion. Others manage to touch the soul and teach us how to confront the wonderful mystery of life. Eastwood has put together a sensitive study of damaged souls and hope. He gives an opportunity to appreciate life and not to give up in the pursuit of our of dreams.Eastwood, Swank, and the always wonderful Freeman move effortlessly and interact with each other with fantastic precision and grace. It is hard not to think of them as fantastic performers and give them their much deserved dues. In an era when people are so fascinated with quick flashes and light analysis of important material, comes a small film that envelops and doesn't let you go. In my second viewing I felt I discovered more of its richness and grew to appreciate it even more. I truly hope that when Academy Awards (which supposedly honor the most accomplished work of the year), the acting, direction, and every other aspect of this film is recognized accordingly. There has been other phenomenal work out this year, most in small films. Don't let this be a make up year or a year that will eventually be recognized by 'should have been' remarks. This million dollar baby is really worth every single buck...",10,5,9,9 January 2005
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," The truth is not so simple
","Nothing is simple here; there is a high level of complexity to the mystery at the heart of the story, and that drives the film ferociously to the very satisfying ending, one that will not leave cheated or confused. The movie is finely tuned, giving the audience much respect for their intelligence, and plenty of pleasure, as old cobwebs are cleared up and the thriller builds up its tension, captivating us, introducing us to memorable characters. These are full of flaws and demons, forces that control and haunt them, leading them to perform actions that could be either punishing, purgatory, or cleansing. Much is left to be the imagination of the viewer, as if the need to know adds excitement to the chase and the hunt.Much of the fascination centers around the performance of the mysterious female investigator. The character is intense, hurt, angry, and resolute to find justice. It is clear that something tortures her, and her desire to tie loose ends serves some sort of purpose not clear to us, and it is possible the resolution to these questions would eventually be known to us. What is most obvious is that we have discovered a fantastic new fictional character, one who is powerful, creative, astute, and dangerous. Much in the way Clarisse in 'Silence of The Lambs' needs darkness to help her recover from earlier trauma, Salander has plenty of emotional baggage, and her fury is the fuel that keeps her going. At times, it blinds her, with her rage take plenty of risky chances.In the end, the mystery at the heart of the film is solved, and there are shocking revelations, a couple of action pieces, giving us a peek into the distorted mind of the criminal, and a glimpse into what our heroine's past might be.There is a powerful and complex family in the middle of the interesting plot, one with its set of skeletons in the closet, one that is not shown in the kindest of lights; yet there is careful peeling of the layers, and much resistance to bait us with unnecessary red herrings. The introduction of possible leads is done intelligently, as rays of lights and color to add more dimension to the story and the characters.'Girl' is dark and intense, with people who live complicated lives and have met or seen pain in horrible ways. We don't see the episodes themselves,but see the results of those events, and how they might have shaped their future. It is not a comic book character, but one with real dark forces lurking in the past, and we are left hungry for future revelations. It's satisfying to know writers are still coming up with original story lines, and that somehow these make it to the movies. People familiar with the series also have reasons to be frustrated, but if this film is a sign of what is to come, three might be our magic number.",10,2,5,25 March 2010
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Integrity and decency
","Clooney's film presents the themes of integrity and decency with an assured hand. It depicts journalism as an ethical and responsible function that is compromised and attacked by others who might have interests other than the public's at hand. 'Good Night' reintroduces us to the historical period where some innocent people might have prosecuted without any evidence of a crime, where the pervasive atmosphere of paranoia overtook common sense and allowed some individuals to become drink with the power of manipulation. It reached levels of madness and indecency, as journalists such as Murrow began questioning intent and agendas. Soon, Murrow became the target of people like McCarthy, who refuse to surrender the spotlight and the power they now command.In 'Good Night and Good Luck', there is never any of the frenzy and heightened emotions so common in media films we had before. The issues are critical and important to the nation, the events are highly emotional, but Clooney assured direction keeps us calm while we observe and study this part of American history. It's interesting to note that some of the speeches by Murrow in the opening and closing scenes are so relevant to today's atmosphere. We live in a country where the media exerts so much power and so rarely it educates us in what is really important. Once I asked a friend what would happen if all the newscasts were canceled one day? He replied 'not many people would complain', then I replied, 'what about sports events?'. His sarcastic comeback was: 'it would be the end of the world'.In conclusion, this film will probably receive well deserved accolades for its fine craftsmanship and performances. Its glorious black and white cinematography enhances and makes us focus on the content, and the accurate and detailed production values support the outstanding performances and directions. It deserves an audience and plenty of awards. Will the public find it? Maybe if they run commercials during some fluff, and then again, we might be busy getting snack or playing with the remote.",10,9,18,9 October 2005
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Evil versus Innocence
","When the camera finally fades, one is left with a sense of loss that is impossible to overcome, there should be shock, anger, or some other intense emotion to counteract the final minutes of the film, but unlike films involving children and death or evil, 'The Orphanage' comes to mind, this one lacks complexity because of the perspective taken by its director. It is a serious film that asks to weigh the beauty of innocence and unawareness of the horrors that become become so embedded in our nature when we're adults. It recalls the fact that many children will call any type of meat chicken because they're unable to understand what categories are. Bruno is beginning to develop his understanding of good and evil. He understands less than he feels, and he can pick that something is wrong; yet not enough to help him do enough for himself and his new found friend.There is fine work in 'The Boy', particularly the mother whose existence is shattered when she realizes how horrible her connections to Nazi Germany truly are. Her is husband is too self involved in his crusade to realize the harm he is causing his family, and at the heart of the story, Bruno's life is still basically, a game.There some illogical developments in the movie, as we have very little tension in some of the scenes involving the children's meetings at the camp's fence. The chemistry between the two boys is perfect, as both of them are representatives of a world that does not have any room for them, and the metaphor might become a bitter reality if the adults fail to recognize the scope of their mistakes.Maybe the film would have been more successful had it been treated as a fantasy, a dream, or a comedy in order to infuse with the contrast that it lacks here. as it is now, it's very simplistic and a bit underdeveloped, yet there is no denying its intended impact.",8,3,5,27 November 2008
Brave," Beary Beary Good...
","Pixar rebounds from last year's weak entry with a vivacious, delightful, and exquisitely rendered tale of growing up and independence. Merida's adventures detail her period of adjustment to what society expects from her, and how this might be in direct opposition to what she dreams of becoming. In between we have her mother, the queen, a strong presence who has for years tried to keep things in order in her kingdom. With her jolly husband and her four children, things are a bit challenging.It is time to join the various kingdom with a prearranged marriage, and the day of the tournament, things don't quite go as expected. Soon, Merida has struck a deal with a legendary member of the forest, and things go from bad to worse. This being Pixar, it all happens in a very entertaining way, making the story move fast, with plenty of visual gags, and enough emotions to pull a tear or two from the audience.Merida begins to appreciate what she is about to lose, and she must race against the clock, as a spell will become permanent in two sunsets, unless she is able to realize a way to fix her mother's condition.The film is at best enchanting, as we travel through the Scottish lands and listen to the various clans interact with each other. The film retains a magical aura throughout, even in the most intimate scenes, and how far we have gone with CGI that now it seems to blend or recreate nature in a more convincing way. Kelly McDonald and Emma Thompson give royal performances as Merida and her mother, and it is my pleasure to note that know every single pair of eyes, particularly the mother bear have an incredible real and affecting look.This is a film that will bewitch its audience and extend Pixar's standards to new highs. A classic.",10,4,8,7 July 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," Everything Works!!
","'Guardians of the Galaxy' is easily the most exciting and pleasant surprise of the year. Personally, I was hooked the minute I saw the preview which gave us hints of the fun coming our way. Fighting over a walkman, mocking the superhero's name, and that irreverent raccoon. Of course, there's no way to dislike anything Zoe Saldana does, and there is much, much more to love here.This movie appears to be paying homage to a few science fiction classics, particularly the original freshness and humor that made 'Star Wars' such a legendary title. Star Lord joins forces with some impulsive characters and try to stop the evil forces from grabbing this magical and powerful sphere that can alter the universe.It's hard to describe the film. It suffices to say that it's an exciting ride from beginning to end because it has action, some sensational special effects, killer funny lines, introduces terrific characters that come across as sensitive, human, and heroic. There are beautiful spaceships, and everyone is literally and figuratively having a blast.You will laugh, be moved, root for the various heroes, never get tired of the 'one-line' tree man. The voice work by Bradley Cooper is as good as Robin Williams' deranged Genie in 'Aladdin', and can anyone complain about having Glenn Close and John C. Reiley in the same movie? And to be top everything there is the terrific scene at the end of the credits.",10,4,9,1 August 2014
The Imitation Game," Ironic Turn of Events
","Benedict Cumberbatch is the soul of the film. Armed with one of the most intelligent scripts of the year, he has managed to convey all the forces that lived inside a very special human being, Mr. Alan Turing. He was the man who for whatever circumstances, was able to understand the laws of logic, math, and strategy, in order to solve a riddle that would lead to saving many human lives and ending one of the worst catastrophes civilizations has endured.Recruited by a secret organization, Turing and a team set out to solve a complex set of codes that will allow England and the allies to stop the Nazis. It is a challenging task, and it appears impossible because of the laws of probability. There are just too many possible combinations. Turing, however, is a brilliant mathematician, and with the support of his team, and the invention of what many would consider the first computer, he makes enough advances to give the allies an upper hand. That is not enough because of the complexity of the matter, but he might have been a key element in ending the war.It is a world of secrets, and this motif evident throughout the film, as everything around the project is secretive. Some people know bits and pieces, and even those who supposedly know everything, are only allowed to reveal bits because otherwise, events might turn out differently. The bosses manipulate secrets to get results, the members of the team know enough to destroy each other, and most importantly, if one of these secrets came out at the wrong moment, the results could be catastrophic.In the end, the main secret comes out, and what results is one of the biggest tragedies that could have happened to the civilized world for a life is destroyed, a man who saved many others with his passion and his drive, and his skills. For years he lived in self-imposed darkness, aware of his limitations and living in fear, and when he is finally exposed, he gives up the personal. At the end, he's recognized for his achievements and 'pardoned', but there is a concluding and ironic note of sadness because the civilization he struggled to save is the one that destroyed him.Cumberbatch carries the film, giving a raw portrayal of a moment torn by his own frustrations, a man who is good, can't truly fight he knows and fears, who in spite of his constant turmoil, puts others ahead of him. Yes, he is arrogant and knows he's special, but he is still a human being, and this shows. It is a difficult role and an amazing transformation. One that doesn't need vanity psychodrama or tricky egotistical trips. Life is complex, hard, and way more interesting than anything than can be written as fiction.",10,5,13,21 December 2014
Jurassic World," Raptors!
","Movies are made to entertain us, and 'World' does a very good job. It brings back the park, enhances it with new rides, and giving us state- of-the-art special effects. Twenty years ago, the illusions were breathtaking because they were fresh, and the technological advances keep raising the bar, and like one of the protagonists in the film said it: audiences keep demanding bigger and better.There is something winning about seeing those mythical creatures come back to life and teach us the error of our ways. One shouldn't wander into their territories and expect no consequences, and we should have learned by now that playing God is a recipe for trouble. We have seen the T-Rex in action, and the devious raptors cause plenty of chaos. Why would anyone want to bring them back after all the havoc they caused in the last three films? Because we have audiences that are hungry for their adventures.Scientists have gone completely crazy now as they use genetic engineering to come up with a more terrifying looking beast that unfortunately combines many of the species used to produce its distinctive look and qualities and as a certain scientist tells us that you can't have something that looks scary without other behavioral traits.The new dinosaur is bigger, meaner, and more psychotic than its other relatives. It manages to trick the park security and before we learn how to say its name correctly, he goes on a killing rampage, having a definite taste for targeting humans. In an interesting twist, raptors are back and can be trained to work as 'security'. The idea is interesting and laughable since we have already forgotten these creatures aren't exactly docile.Here comes Chris Pratt, with his matinée idol presence, being a bit of a 'raptor charmer', or maybe he's just a very good teacher. He has taught them well and earned somewhat their trust; he just doesn't know that these raptors might soon discover they have an unexpected alliance with some of the park's other residents, and it doesn't involve being friendly to humans.There is plenty of spectacle as children are being chased, nannies and other security personnel become dinosaur chow, and the park manager can fashionable wield an automatic weapon and run even faster than some of the other people in five-inch heels. Howard has plenty of fun playing a female Indiana Jones and is Pratt's match. She's also quite an aunt to those nephews she neglects and almost feeds to her new park attraction.Lastly, one mustn't forget this is like a park ride. There is not much to think about, just get on it and enjoy the new offerings, the thrills, the looks, and the scares. Otherwise, stay home and read a book because this is not food for thought but a thrill for the audience.",9,18,44,20 June 2015
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," visually and emotionally satisfying
","Tim Burton has redeemed himself with this interpretation of the classic story by Dahl. He has put together a group of talented and charismatic performers who bring out the spirit of the original story and enhanced it with amazing production values. Yes, it's different and at times, it feels odd, but it contains a good message which it delivers in quite an entertaining manner.The beginning is reminiscent of 'Edward Scissorhands', introducing us to Charlie's family and setting up the big scenes to come. Freddie Highmore's Charlie Bucket is a sensitive and quite mature youngster who has been raised with good values by two generations of his family. They echo the strong family relationship of 'The Waltons', and Burton makes sure the early scenes display both sweetness and uniqueness. These folks might be honest but they are also very interesting to listen and look at.The early segments also introduce us to the other four children who play important roles in the development of the story, and it's a hoot to see some of their introductions. Here's when we first encounter the twisted sense of humor that connects the rest of the film and makes the experience in the factory a true delight.There are moments in the factory scenes when Burton appears to be trying a little too hard; however it is the originality of his approach, coupled with some of the most incredible art direction presented in a modern film that makes the film a treat. There are a couple of musical number that would have inspired Busby Berkeley.He might not be the main reason the film succeeds, and yet his performance is once again a triumph of the amazing talent Johnny Depp has. His Wonka is to put it mildly 'odd'. His speech and his facial expressions captivate, repulse, and hypnotize at the same time. He commands the screen and easily fits into this wondrous universe.Be ready to enjoy the ride and appreciate that Hollywood is capable of creating magic. Here is a film that justifies big budgets and respects the value of good source material. Depp, Burton, and Hightower are names that Oscar should keep in mind at the end of the year.",9,5,9,17 July 2005
World Trade Center," A Masterpiece from a Passionate Director
","Stone has directed some of the best films of the last 100 years. He, along with Spielberg, understands the power of a good script, a good story, good cinematography, good editing, and most importantly, the ability to connect and make his audience react. 'Word Trade Center' offers him another opportunity to handle material that cannot be ignored. What is special about this project is how Stone manages to make a flawless and superb film that does exactly what is supposed to do without compromising or disrespecting its audience, as many contemporary films are doing lately. This film doesn't have a bloated running time because it is compact, direct, without an ounce of fat. It also contains a very tight screenplay that does not waste anytime with pontification or over-sentimentality. What we see is enough to breakdown any emotional resistance we could have about the material (as if it that was possible). In addition, we are able to see a story told in a very interesting way, though not in real time, in a series of scenes that are slow, deliberate, and direct.Stone's assured direction keeps the details intimate and personal, yet it provides a connection to the universal emotions that bring out the best in all of us, without ignoring the fact that there are also some negative counterparts. With the help of a very talented production team, the film boasts a perfect blend of technical, old fashioned film making, and smoothly integrated computer effects. It is an impressive piece of work, and it surely deserves to receive as many accolades as possible at the end of the year. It is an important film because of its themes and its execution. This is definitely one of his best works as a director, showing many in Hollywood that it is possible to captivate and relate to an audience, going beyond a concept, an idea, a production meeting by carefully integrating every element of cinema and always respecting the audience and the material.Earlier on, we were witnesses to the talented Streep in two very good films. 'WTC' has four marvelous performances from actors who have done good work in the past, but now stand out in a year that might not have great films but some very performances. 'WTC' is an excellent film because the very talented Maria Bello once again shows that she can bring life to a character from very deep inside. She is a tower of strength, besieged by her own crisis, and she conveys her distress with an economy of gestures and words in a lovely and expert performance. Cage does very well in his restricted physical setting by carefully transmitting his emotions with his voice and his eyes. He is excellent, and Pena equally matches Cage's superb work. There is the most conventional work, not less effective acting by Gyllenthal who surpasses anything she and her brother have done in the past, as she portrays the distressed wife, who is unsure of what will be expected of her as the events unfold.'WTC' is an amazing film and hopefully will be recognized by many for what it is, an example of how powerful good cinema truly is. For those who view Stone as a political headache, watch the film without any preconceptions and just witness what real talent can do.",10,5,12,9 August 2006
Prisoners," Jackman reaches new heights in the depths of hell
","It would be easy to compare this film to many classics that came before. Maybe they served as inspiration to produce something that would make any of the masters proud. Polanski, De Palma, Hitchcock, and Demme come to mind. Here is a director who has availed himself of what could rank with the best scripts ever written: a piece so tightly constructed is almost impossible to look away. We are grabbed right away when the children are abducted, and slowly the grip tightens until it's almost unbearable. We want to know the truth, we want to relax and hope for the best, but this is not going to be a smooth ride by any means.Two daughters disappear during the holidays. We have obvious suspects, but as we soon learn, the investigation will not be short or simple. The trail grows cold, and we have many frustrated parties. The police hits a dead end. One of the parents goes absolutely mad with rage and despair. Another succumbs when she is unable to look at evil on the face. The other couple feels helpless, and the younger siblings are also undergoing their own torment.One of the suspects appears unable to communicate what he might know, and this leads him to become an abducted of sorts. Before we notice, we have another possible criminal darting and out of the picture. In less capable hands, we would feel like we're being cheated, but this is a valid move by the writers, and it pays off handsomely in the end. A maze becomes an essential key to solving the problem, but this maze is a hell of a challenge.As we reach the last third of the film, we begin to reach the conclusion, but instead of losing steam, the film becomes even more gripping, giving us satisfaction unlike nothing seen in recent movies. The last time I sat at the edge of my chair was in 1991 when Clarisse wandered into hell at the end of her quest. There is an obvious tribute to that film here, and it will be talked about for ages because it at the forefront in this film's conclusion, a moment that is bound to become a classic.Jackman, Davis, Howard, Leo, Bello, and Gyllenthal do some of the best work in decades, but if we are to single out a performance, we have Jackman as the tortured father who might not like what he discovers as he searches for his daughter. It is a devastating performance, one to be studied and discussed because it shows what an actor is able to do with the right support: a beautiful script, a director who values and understand what is important in the making of a movie and doesn't rely on technology or gimmicks, and an actor who knows that in order to play any role, he must dig deep and not hold back. Jackman does just this and we are in awe.Just remember these words: THE END. The way you see any other conclusion this year will never be the same.",10,3,6,22 September 2013
Silence," I Can't Believe
","'Silence' is en experience, a trip into the hell some 'padres' went through during their attempt to spread the Christian faith in Japan during the 1600's. The film tries to give us a peek into the treatment of the priests once the locals decided to institute a policy that found the practice of forbidden doctrines illegal and punishable. When the movie opens, we go straight to the depiction of some of the ways Japanese tortured some of the Christian followers.Next, plans are approved to start searching for one missing priest. It's the duty of two young priests to locate him, save him, maybe even do a little Christian work to save and enlighten a few souls. This is where the problem begins: There's something sloppy about the way the quest is introduced, and we have three characters who don't seem to even believe whatever comes of their mouths. One looks doubtful, the other is eager but his his eyes don't project any fire, and one seems to have wandered from another period, setting, and faith, maybe even another picture. He looks militant, irascible, doubtful this will have a positive ending. It seems as if he knows this is all futile--their enterprise and maybe the whole act of watching this film.When the two young men arrive in Japan, our own torture begins, as we listen to dialog that is both incomprehensible and stilted. Never we get into believing that these people have any commitment to anyone but themselves. I'm not sure if it is the acting, the directing, the endless scenes that appear to go in circles, never revealing or truly pulling all the different layers of a complex theme. The setting is dark, grungy, inhospitable, and very foreign. It is never clear why they decide to start their journey in the middle of the winter, or what appears to be the very foggy season in this island. It becomes annoying.Bring on the never ending series of psychological, physical, and amazingly, very little exploration of theological questions. In 'The Last Temptation of Christ' one is willing to overlook some strange casting choices because the central figure is powerful, and well played by DeFoe, giving us a new perspective of what one of the most famous people in history must have gone through. Here, Rodriguez looks lost, both within the story, and Garfield is never anything but a selfish, whiny, and sick looking man of the cloth. I couldn't help thinking about the other long suffering fictional character of the year, Lee in 'Manchester by the Sea'. At least, we had a solid portrayal of pain, guilt, and impotence. 'Silence' doesn't even give you a hint of any of those emotions.In addition, the length of the film is unbearable. Much doesn't happen for minutes. We have shots of the surroundings, conversations that highlight the redundancy that weakens the film. It is not as if there was nothing to discuss or explain. It felt like a jackhammer kept going and going, keeping us from engaging, from developing any sort of rhythm and connection to the material. The depiction of the torture and persecution never stopped, getting to the point that the ordeal of the troops captured by the Japanese in a recent World War II film appeared more like a prank by a bully. The torture scenes are not something to avoid because they're too graphic; however it feels like the ones being tortured are the members of the audience because we either have to suffer through the weak dialog which goes nowhere or another way in which the bad guys show their bad qualities, and/or, the Christians keep experiencing hell.There is a very reliable team behind the production. Sadly, there is also a pervasive realization that nothing really works. Landscapes and close ups are admirable in their clarity but drained of any emotions. The lack of musical score is jarring making the 'silence' way too overbearing and boring. Costumes and sets might be accurate but feel empty because the characters are poorly presented, and I was wondering where the editor went because we could have easily removed 1/2 of the film, and we would have gotten the same amount of pertinent information. The only scenes that appeared to really work involve Liam Nesson, an actor whose presence and delivery allows us to have an idea of what really is going on. To make matters even worse, this makes every other performer look even worse.If anyone wants to see how spirituality can be shown, with and without the explicit reference to a particular faith, through beautiful cinematography and the perfect marriage of sound and visuals, check Mallick's 'The New World'. For now, some real silence seems more than appropriate.",4,81,148,24 December 2016
Logan," Jackman's Powerful Turn
","'Logan' is that very rare movie which is a taut and solid drama, with a superb turn by the marvelous Jackman, giving it his all, showing a range not seen since Heath's Joker interpretation. It's almost like being the other side of the coin, a good man, tortured by guilt, tired of his dark odyssey, a champion who is not allowed to quit, even though his pain has levels which are not unbearable both physically and mentally. 'Logan' wishes this all ends soon, and the audience will not be disappointed, but they will be both sad and happy that the film presents a very realistic and appropriate ending.On the other hand, 'Logan' is still a super hero movies, but with a huge heart and much intelligence and respect for the source. Having the powers not become the center of the film, but the family drama makes the film more powerful. There are strong bonds here, with Xavier doing his best to control Logan's tortured nature and his shock at the discovery of the new relationships he is now facing. Jackman's eyes are extraordinary, providing us access into his private hell. He's in agony for most of the story, and he uses his body expertly to convey just how difficult it is to even move around. If you consider, that the adversaries are now some of the strongest he has ever encounter, the outcome doesn't look very good.If Jackman wasn't so good this time, a lot of the credit would to the newcomers, especially the girl who plays another version of a very familiar mutant, as moody and overwhelmed with much emotional turmoil. What is very impressive in that performance is the conviction demonstrated by young girls over the last year. Just like the performers in 'Strange Things', the young ones here are complex and far reaching. There's hardly a happy moment here, with bodies scattered all over the country as Logan tries to reach safe heaven.'Logan' is a over two hours, but one knows its conclusion is not the end of the story. A big chapter ends, and we want to know what is next because as the baton is passed, we now the quality will continue, and under the careful production, direction, writing, and editing of team headed by Mangold, we should more than pleased with the results and wish there is more coming, as dark and as painful, but with a little hope.Enjoy!",10,2,6,4 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Moving Along
","'Ultron' comes and delivers most of what the trailers promised: a darker, more complex vision of what the superheroes must confront in order to keep this planet going. Maybe it was too ambitious to begin with because after all, we have technology, mythology, and a dash of romance in there. If you care to make it more complicated, we can a bit of disfunctionality and the issue of artificial intelligence overriding the intent of its creators.'Ultron' is more of what we got the last time out, but it might be a little more than we should have. There are big explosions, close calls, sacrifices, and the development of some very interesting relationships between humans, Gods, and machines. The fluidity of how can transform into another is one of the film's highlights, and rarely we get to see the flaws in these beings, and we see plenty here.Of course, we see monumental displays of technological destruction, and Ultron is one of the best villains we have seen in a while, beautifully rendered by the latest wonders of CGI and perfectly brought to life by James Spader who can make wonders happen with in the unlikeliest of characters. He makes us admire and hate Ultron. He's after fighting for what humans want: a perfect life, and if this requires the destruction of those flawed humans, well, let it be.I have seen a few negative comments here, and that might be because once again, we have been given food for thought, and that's a bit of task for those who just want to see mindless fun (another 2015 blockbuster) come to mind. There's plenty of admiration for Science Fiction/Fantasy that explores issues and situations which have a foothold in reality. I keep thinking about those communicators in 'Star Trek', the allusions to soul, life, and artificial intelligence explored in 'TNG'. Go and have a little fun, and dare to ponder along the way.",9,1,5,3 May 2015
Hotel Transylvania," Having Fun with The Monsters
","It feels pretty good when people take an old story and put a fresh spin on it. 'Transylvania' is a great new entry in the world of animation movies, a genre that has been thriving for the most part in the last couple of decades. In the new film, Count Dracula and to a certain extent, some of his monster peers discover that family life can a bit stressful. That's in addition to having to deal with centuries of problems with humans.Things get so bad that Dracula builds a 'resort' where misunderstood creatures can find peace and protection from the rest of the world. It also helps him deal with his 118 year old daughter. It all appears to be working until one day, an adventurous human soul wanders into the castle, and things become even more complicated for all parties involved.Soon, we have Dracula trying to contain the damage, keep up appearances, and eventually trying some unorthodox methods to solve his problem. The film, like 'Paranormal' earlier this year shows plenty of heart, tolerance and has us entertained throughout the movie. In fact, the film remembers to bring in music, comedy, and some sharp and clever dialogue. There is plenty of vocal talent in the film, all contributing a bit to the overall effect. Kevin James, Sandler, Drescher, and Gomez are among the standouts.'Hotel Transylvania' deserves plenty of recognition, and most importantly, should be enjoyed.",9,5,8,30 September 2012
The Dark Knight," A Thrill for the mind and the senses
","After several outstanding actions movies this year, we get the idea that filmmakers have finally started doing justice to the original sources, the stories of heroes that are flawed, strive to conquer evil and maybe eventually better themselves and the world. We had the joy of traveling the road with 'Ironman', with its flawed protagonist who tries very hard to use technology to defeat his nemesis. Then Indiana Jones makes a return appearance, showing how age is taking its toll on his armor, giving us a couple of surprises and quite an ending for its installment. The much improved 'Hulk' benefits from a leaner screenplay and a great performance by Norton, but nothing prepared for us the magnificent achievement that the sequel to 'Batman Begins' turned out to be.'The Dark Knight' is almost a perfect film. Its sole blemish is a bit of miscasting, taking away a bit of the believability of the main character. Leaving that aside, we welcome back Michael Caine's Alfred, with his blend of sarcasm and fondness for his protégé. Then Morgan Freeman's imposing technological wizardry, still works very well, as he must now decide whether he should follow Bruce Wayne in his new path. Oldman's commissioner takes on more responsibilities and makes more dangerous choices, some of which will shock the audience.It's the new arrivals that add the punch to this film, first Eckart's Two Face is a wonder to behold in his transformation from the ultimate knight in shining armor to the tormented villain who descends into madness as the film reaches its conclusion. However, it is the wonderful and bewitching Ledger who has the winning hand and turns what could be a regular drama into a powerful epic where evil has no reason and knows no fear. His Joker is a perverse, demented, and killing machine, a creature that knows no boundaries, doesn't know the meaning of remorse or probably listens to his conscience anymore, if he ever had one.His series of crimes begins with an assault on a local bank, and the execution of the heist is explosive and unforgiving, and if the audience is still catching his breath from the explosive happening, this sets the stage for worse things to come. Soon this metropolis will have turned into hell and the Joker is king, with Batman soon struggling to find ways to control the chaos and realizing this might be the challenge of his life.Ledger's performance has many shades, incorporating a range of emotions hardly seen in any movies before. His madness is a very cool act, a performance for those who want to pay attention to the repulsive actions of a criminal who wants to test the mettle of a society that is slowly thinking into something more horrible than they want to believe. He knows this and grabs them by the throat, soon having them confront their fears and their natures. Words like unbelievable will come to mind as we seen him do his joyful, demented celebratory dance, telling others that the world is about to end. If the film is not perfect, Ledger is, a force to behold, and an intensity to match, and this where Bale comes.Bale doesn't disappoint, and he delivers his most solid performance, as his caped crusader must use his wit, physical stamina, and his sense of morale to vanquish his biggest challenges. Bale is now tormented by guilt and pain, like he has never seen before, and he might soon discover that he is someone he didn't know.'The Dark Knight' is indeed a masterpiece, a film that weaves many elements, rarely seen in escapist entertainment, such as the superhero genre. We have a story dealing with human duality, with political and social ethics, with the fine line that separates sanity and madness, and what each might be. There are many floating metaphors in this film, such as the coin, the choice, the colors, the meaning of what truth really is. It is a fantastic achievement, and it should be honored and recognized by everyone who sees it.",10,2,5,22 July 2008
Everest," Challenging Nature
","'Everest' is the type of film that one wants to see because it offers the opportunity to see a very special part of the world, the most impressive mountains on the planet, majestic, forbidden territory, the ultimate challenge for those who dare to go there.The story introduces a group of people who are apparently ready to take on the challenge. Some are going for the first time, some are veterans and have climbed a few of the other peaks in the chain. It becomes apparent that they will be able to handle most of what is there, and some might not make it, but what we don't know is how different the outcome will be because one element they haven't considered is the unpredictability of the elements in nature.We are giving a passable amount of background, which becomes a weakness here. There's too many characters to follow, and the screenwriter just fails to focus on two or three of them, trying too hard to introduce too many, neglecting to focus on what should have been the main element, the challenge, the power of the mountain, the impending possibility that nothing should be taken for granted. Considerable care goes into telling us what could happen if something goes wrong, but it never feels as if we are there with the expedition members. We get to see them play the roles, but they are sketchy performances. We know we have jocks, addicts, adrenaline junkies, etc. We never really get to know anyone. It's a pity because Gyllenthal, Brolin, and other fine actors are given little to work with.One thing that stands out is that the trip never feels that special. Yes, the winds are there, the storms are loud and deadly, the temperatures can maim and kill you because they're part of the film, but the emotional build up is weak, and we see something that is neither a good documentary or a very dramatic film. It's supposed be a thrilling ride, but we get something that never reaches that level.",7,1,2,17 October 2015
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Much to Praise in This Outstanding Adaptation
","The Potter films have been getting better as they are released. Some of the subtleties that were notably absent from the first two entries are now very much in evidence, and unlike other series, the main actors have developed and grown into more assured professionals; a fact that is remarkable, considering that the young protagonists must hold their own against some classically trained actors. In particular, Daniel Radcliffe is so confident that he owns the screen with visual expressions that allows us to understand the growing pains of the character, his turmoil, and his ever increasing crisis.Very much in evidence is Potter's frustrations as an intense smear campaign is underway to do everything that is possible to allow Voldermort to raise his armies again. As Dolores Umbridge makes a sensational and devastating appearance at Hogwarts, she manages to censure and stiffle the training of anyone who might lead to instability and support of a possible rebellion. Dolores is an instant villain, a blend of two styles, the solicitous hypocrite who is not afraid to be duplicitous and brags about having two sides. She's a frail old lady with a nasty streak.The film shows the underground revolution that is brewing at Hogwarts out of desperation by Harry and his close friends. What takes plenty of description in the novel is succinctly presented in the film, as we see the evolution of evil, the dangers of censorship, and the ever brewing nastiness that will come back as Voldemort reappears.The entire film is exciting and dark, quiet but threatening, and it explodes in all its glory during the last 1/2 hour as good now must confront evil, and Harry faces the demise of another close associate. The film is enhanced by a quiet and insistent score heightening the underground tensions that are part of the Potter world. There are the adolescent yearnings between Potter, Hermoine, and Ron, delightfully played by Watson and Grint. There are some amazing new entries, such as Evanna Lynch playing Lovegood and Natalie Tena, playing Nymphadora. I also appreciated the extra time given to Oldman, Smith, and Gambon, who can now show their characters' details a bit more.Be ready to do some explaining to the younger ones about what is now happening in the Potter universe, where there is more emphasis on the preparations for the final battles, with some foreshadowing about what might be the final result. Words like prophecies and destiny are now carefully stressed in main parts of the plot. Is Potter going to survive? or Will he lose everything like his nemesis states?It is a haunting and beautiful film, one that does no disservice to the prose of Rowlings, who has been inspired by other classic pieces, but now has created her own universe, which has now grown beautiful and real in the series of adaptations, the last of which is probably one of the finest and most powerful.Expect amazing camera-work and special effect wizardry in the last section of the film. It is an instant classic.",10,6,14,12 July 2007
Into the Wild," Into the Soul of a Man
","'Into the Wild' is not the sort of picture that seems to bring to mind Sean Penn. True, he is one of the most passionate, dedicated, and intense performers to work in Hollywood, a man who has given us some of the best performances in the last two decades. What he has done is to go behind the camera and transfered that passion into a work of enormous sympathy, compassion, and spirituality.In the novel, it is not very clear what drives the obsessive behavior of Alex (Chris). In the movie, the forces are somehow more positive but the results are still tragic, with a slight difference in the tone of the closing scene. It is not the end what matters but the journey, and the journey, as presented by both the novel and especially, this very fine film is something to behold.The movie takes us back and forth in time and expands on some of the background and motivation behind this young man's odyssey. We are given information as to what happened in his home, and there are still subtle hints as to how he sought and acquire the need to connect with happiness, the one thing he yearned and which, in the final epiphany proves to be somewhat ironic. As played by Hirsch, the revelation is heartbreaking, but as I mentioned before, it's those glorious moments where he somehow connects to what he thinks he wants that raise this film into very special places.To be able to achieve that, Penn's directorial job is perfectly supported by a truly amazing cast, which includes William Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden, Jena Malone, Vince Vaughn, and in a lovingly portrayal, Hal Holbrook, whose every minute in the screen shows the yearning for companionship and the effects of true love on people. The film clocks in at almost two hours, and every minute is precious, full of emotion, feelings, potent forces that appeal to us, yet simultaneously scare us.It's gorgeously photographed, and scored with much insight in order to deepen the effect of the story. It's a movie that should be viewed by all, regardless of whether we understand the message at first. The truth is that it's hard to imagine anyone not affected by it.",10,5,11,22 September 2007
Blood Diamond," Bloody Overkill
","It's hard to dismiss work by Di Caprio as something substandard, and Zwick has in previous occasions come up with work that transcends the physical and shows us what our spirit can achieve. There is plenty of good intentions in this film, and I'm glad it exposes something of the horrendous crimes that are seldom publicized for some of the peoples in Africa.What I found disturbing in this film is the amount of violence that has somehow found its way to the final cut, and the problem with having too much in it is that it does result in a state of numbness. It's still horrible to watch as it is effectively portrayed in the film, and it hovers too closely to a caricature. 'Hotel Rwanda' brought hell portrayed hell effectively, with enough shown to us so that we could understand the intensity of the tragedy. In here, hell is threatening to kill the heart of the film, as it becomes the central protagonist, keeping us from connecting to the human tragedy that is at the heart of the film.Fortunately, we have an actor like Hinsou, who is able to show us how his soul is traumatized as he sees what goes around him, with his immediate family's situation and with the people who are dying and killing each other in front of him.There are very powerful moments in this film, particularly the ones showing you the destruction of innocence, as children are brainwashed and indoctrinated into becoming monsters to serve a different type of regime. Sadly, even DiCaprio can't lift the film beyond an average level where machinery rules and the soul disappears behind the use of technology and special effects. He is much more effective showing us the turmoil in the soul of his character in 'The Departed'. In here the transformation from manipulator to benefactor rings a bit phony. It might not be his fault, but it might be the interpretation of a script that needed a little more work to expose this tragedy in a more impacting manner.'Blood Diamond' is just too much of something... horrible and violent as it could be.",6,0,3,11 December 2006
Pride & Prejudice," Romantic, Classy, and Very Delightful
","Once upon a time there was a feisty lovely woman who was ahead of her time, and she managed to ruffle a few feathers on her way in her quest to find the love of her life. This would be a rather simplistic way to put in words what happens in this charming and bewitching film. It isn't the first time we see an adaptation of the Jane Austen title, but it is one of the times when we feel rewarded and very satisfied with its design.It is hard to fail when the supporting cast an imposing Judy Dench, giving us another one of her powerhouse and scene stealing performances. What makes this film a joy to watch is the casting behind the heroine of the film, Ms. Knightley, who at 18 years old, can hold her own against one of the most formidable figures of British cinema. She does a very capable job in her handling of Austen's precise vocabulary, and she projects both a fiery spirit combined with lovely intelligence, and shades of alluring sensuality. There are powerful, quiet scenes in this film where all hangs around what the camera is able to capture, and it is when the chemistry between both leading actors flows that we know the film works best.In addition, we have faithful portrayals of the rest of characters in this tale of social classes. There are marked differences between the wealthy class and a family that barely hangs on to middle class. The fine characterization of all the female archetype is something to behold. We are treated to range and variety, and consistency in the great performances all around.There is much to admire in the love story (or is it stories). It has depth, feeling, intelligence, respect for its audience, and some of the most enchanting cinematography in a year where there is a wealth of riches for cinematographers. The detail in the camera work leaves you breathless in a few key scenes, and it's consistent throughout the film, where very nothing is left to chance. It is lovely work. The costumes and the art directions are also quite special and will probably be honored later this year.Here is proof we can still go to the movies and let true talent shine through. I do admire celebrities and their tours to promote films. What I do treasure is seeing that the hype is based on solid qualities and not just the result of desperate attempts at creating make believe. Knightley made quite a splash in both 'Bend It Like Beckham' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean'. She is only 19, and so far it looks like the best is yet to come. Austen would be proud of her performance, and we should be glad we have stars like her in our cinema heaven.",10,2,4,13 November 2005
Elysium," Is this the worst science fiction movie ever?
","I never thought Jodie Foster could be in a bad film? It seemed unbelievable that Damon could be part of something so terrible? Yet it has happened. Other than some neat special effects, we are once again treated to a film where the outline never grew to a completed project. Here are the rich versus the poor, a bit of programming that could change history, and yes, poor people speak Spanish and rich people converse in French. On top of that the main thug speaks in an intelligible accent, and Elysium resembles a hybrid of Beverly Hills and Southern Florida. This is just the beginning.There is the martyr figure played by Damon who is on his way to redeem himself from making a few mistakes while being young. An old girlfriend shows up with a sick child, and the rebels in the late 21st century look even worse than the citizens of 'Waterworld'. While we follow the thinnest of stories whose end we can see from the beginning credits, we are also treated to some of the most jarring and jumpy camera-work ever seen in a big Hollywood production. The dialogue is at best amateurish and not very interesting, particularly when we think about how sophisticated audiences are nowadays.What is worse is that we don't have much to care about in this film. The best about the villain is how well she dresses, but even her acting feels listless. She might as well be ordering food over the phone when she wants some spaceships shot down. Then there is the look of the technology of the period. Everybody's spacecraft looks like something out of a cereal box, the robots are cheap copies of something we have seen before, and we really shouldn't care for this. After all, 'Star Wars' was at first big on charm, story, and a great mix of editing/direction. This time the goal must have been to mix every target.What is next? We are all waiting for J.J. to come through and save the genre, again?",2,23,48,11 August 2013
Alice in Wonderland," Interesting, Intriguing, and Imperfect
","When you hear that Tim Burton and Johnny Depp are going to experiment and collaborate in a project based on one of the most mind bending books of all time, you know there are possibilities for this become a feast for the senses, and it's extremely disappointing when the magic is not strong or satisfying enough.Much of the problematic situation occurs with the dim 3-D experience where colors that were enticing and wild are muted. In complete contrast to some of the beautiful displays in 'Avatar', this wild ride doesn't even get to shine or boast a palette that would make the whole event more bewitching.In addition to the color scheme, Burton's reins are not quite in control. The character of Alice appears befuddled (as it should be), but the myriad of supporting denizens of Wonderland can't seem to go beyond just being 'strange'. Much of problem originates in the fact that they have very little to work with. The situation is tense in the real world, but not very interesting in Wonderland where rivalries are mostly boring exchanges of plain good old boring remarks to crazy power hungry threats to chop off body parts.Amazingly enough the younger members of the audience seemed pleased, and that might be the producers' original intent, but thinking parties might be not be satisfied with this bland mix. Pixar seems to pull the trick, I just wonder how crazy the experience would have been in the right hands. Maybe, there is the possibility the sequel might be saved?",5,2,5,7 March 2010
Avatar," When Lighting Strikes
","James Cameron does learn from his previous efforts and keeps getting better and better, and he has come close to achieving perfection in his latest production, the marvelous and wonderful 'Avatar', a film with non stop energy that entertains, teaches, and delights us. Though not completely original, the film shines because its elements all fit into place and take us through experiences which will probably never be matched or surpassed in the silver screen.'Avatar' is the story of the conflicts between two worlds, one protecting his idyllic environment where everything has a connection to an unifying force and spirit, and another one that continues to self destruct by greed and lack of insight. As we are introduced to the wonders of Pandora, an ironic name if any, the wonders begin. Cameron has given us sights and creations of amazing imagination, with the fauna and flora that parades in front of our eyes, fantastic beings with much more life in them than most of any previous CGI creatures, come to mind the dinosaurs and gorillas of 'Jurassic Park' and 'King Kong', but the new animals show more force and agility, and what takes our breath away is how real their interaction appears to be.The crowning jewel are the humanoids native to Pandora, tall and proud blue skinned beings, lovingly rendered by computer programs that rely heavily on the performances of the cast. A million years ahead of the work done with similar process by Zemeckis in the disturbing 'Polar Express' and 'Christmas Carol', the people from Pandora manage to express their emotions quite eloquently, and those emotions range from jealousy to heartbreak. Most incredible work is done by Worthington and Saldana, as the central couple who must learn to understand and appreciate each other.Humand eventually try to encroach over the people of Pandora's natural resources, by any means necessary, and a epic battle results because of the destruction of secret sites in order to break the natives' spirits. These are powerful scenes, full of an intensity rarely seen in epic/fantasy films, and the last hour of the film delivers what has sorely been missing from the latest entries by Scott in 'Kingdom of Heaven' and Stone's 'Alexander', a vibrant and powerful collection of physical confrontations where survival is the key element, spectacle is mixed with sheer will and determination, and the results are magnificent.Finally, I can't heap enough praise upon this sensation movie, the best of 2009, one that is as powerful as 'Departures', as imaginative and entertaining as 'Star Trek', full of some of the wonder of 'Up', and with great performances that recalls the amazing work of Robin Williams in the 'World's Greatest Dad' and Jessica Biel's and Kristin Scott-Thomas in 'Easy Virtue', films that like 'Avatar' are worth a second or third viewing because they aim and hit their respective targets because of their pure cinematic power. How does one know that a film will become a classic? When one leave the theatre and can't wait to see it again for the sum of its parts, not by misreading the power of a single performance and hoping the luster will compensate for the mediocrity of the rest of the film, or by hoping that a set of clever lines will turn a screenplay into gold. Cameron has made sure 'Avatar''s separate parts all work in tune, from its performances, to its screenplay, to its editing, and special effects, never forgetting that what matters the most is the fact that its heart beats with enough conviction to connect to the sense of wonder in all of us. A great film.",10,40,66,30 December 2009
Selma," That mark was so close
","'Selma' deals with key events in 1964 and 1965. It shows how difficult it was for Johnson to maneuver politics and eventually pass legislation to protect the civil rights of all the citizens in this country. Of course, nothing would have happened without the drive and dedication of Martin Luther King. He inspired and convinced many to see what was happening in the South becoming a political and spiritual leader to many, advocating patience, resilience, and non-violent approaches.Of course, it's not easy to change society overnight, and there were many obstacles along the way, many of them a very dangerous and hateful nature. People were hit, tortured psychologically, rights were dismissed under the most ridiculous and evil circumstances, and innocent lives were destroyed along the way.It is almost unbelievable to see how this happened only 50 years ago, watching how men justified their actions under the most illogical reasoning. It is heartbreaking and infuriating to see how voting rights are denied, a dying culture continues, with the support of ignorance and violence. The best scenes in 'Selma' is when we are witnesses to the beating of people asking for their rights, and we wonder who is worse, the executors of the beating or those who just stand there fueling the fire, or tacitly approving.One of the most fascinating aspects of the film is listening to politicians being afraid of change, of alienating those in power. There are comparisons to looking at the talk of helping other countries but ignoring our own needs. Unfortunately, something happens here, and the words don't quite match the powerful images.At times 'Selma' feels like an amazing achievement showing the epic moments. There is also plenty of power in the portrayal of the African American leader, but something else fails to make a connection. Still, the film is a pretty powerful reminder of the forces and events that have shaped this country.",7,6,14,10 January 2015
Grindhouse," It restores back the magic of cinema
","Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, in particular the latter can create some extraordinary cinematic material. In fact, this double feature is as close to perfection, as it can be, indirectly paying tribute to all the elements that made going to the movies a lot of fun: silly and enjoyable previews, cheesy music scores, over the top acting, and interesting and enjoyable camera-work. There is on minor negative elements, and it is having the unnecessary and rather distracting 'cameo' by one of the filmmakers, whose acting skills are practically non existing. Had Rodriguez stayed with his otherwise capable cast, he would have ended up with a flawless film.Everything in the features work, from the quick, smart dialog, to some of the most eye-popping special effects in a major production in quite a while. This film treats us to a shower of amusing, disgusting, and gross make up work that would Romero, Craven, and Roth blush. As jaded as audiences have become, we couldn't help but cringe at some of the bloody mess flying perversely on the screen.Rodriguez once again shows how multi talented he is, as he in charge of the very interesting, scratchy camera-work, the dialog that never stops entertaining, and his relaxed but precise direction to make his cast rise to the occasion. I kept wondering how much was spent on this film, and I can probably guess that it's just a fraction of what other 'event' movies cost. One can only dream that this diverts the attention back to what makes the art of cinema special and steers away from relying so much on overpaid and overrated talent who hardly strives to produce good work anymore.Hollywood continues moving to achieving another golden crown in 2007.",9,2,8,8 April 2007
The Artist," A Real Valentine to the Movies
","Without the need of 3D, its beauty and its power will jump at you. Set in the 1920's and early 1930s, 'The Artist' shows without unnecessary complications how movies became a part of our lives. George Valentin is one of the icons who rule the world of cinema in silent pictures. He is adored by fans, and he knows it. What he doesn't expect is that times are changing, and he should at least be cognizant of it.Soon, the world is different, and George must face the hardships the market crash, poor foresight, and the arrival of sound in cinema place on him. The film gives us an entertaining look at Hollywood, as silent films are played inside a silent film, and all the drama surrounding the production of such films, the effects on the personal lives of actors, and most importantly, the powerful cultural forces that films are.For a century now, they have become part of our lives, and actors like Valentin and Miller are stand-in's for figures like Garfield, Garbo, Swanson, and some of the stars who faded or managed to survive. The personal tragedy of Valentine is a love letter to the joys movies give us. Playing like a silent film, the film and his performance are a joy to watch. Every gesture reminds us that every look resonated on the big screen, and how important a well written screenplay has always been. Yes, the actors might have mugged the camera in more than one occasion, but there was a pure force up there, beyond special effects, and the influence of research and marketing. We have always gone to the films to be entertained, to see our stories up there.'The Artist' tells a universal story: the way people live, love, survive, make mistakes, learn, and move on. Valentin has to deal with a series of obstacles, and what's outstanding is that he makes every second of this film rich and touching. Dujardin, the actor, could have been a silent movie star. He proves it with his performance, and he shows what a marvelous actor really is now, as he is able to tell a story with his face, with his eyes, with physical dexterity. All of this is accomplished with the assistance of a great director who respects and loves the films that inspired him. One is able to see the various tributes throughout the film. This film flows and has a strong real heartbeat from its first frame, and its exuberant conclusion is a sweet testament that there is still hope for us, movie lovers. Here is a movie that should be playing in real movie theaters and not be treated as if it belongs in a museum. Ironically, unlike the other tribute released this year, so dependent on the themes of time, I never looked at my watch this time because I didn't want this gem to end.Forget color, 3D technology, crazy camera moves, get in line and prepare yourself for a rare and truly satisfying experience, a movie that will help you relive and understand what an amazing time one can have at the movie. I wanted to see this film again after it ended, and I'm sure most of us will probably see it over and over.",10,1,5,9 December 2011
La La Land," Dreams Don't Come True
","'La La Land' has been receiving dozens of accolades about its look, its stars, its love of musicals, and its ability to transport us to a world long gone from the American movies. Damien Chazelle exploded in the movie scene with 'Whiplash', a movie that burst with emotions, music, and strong performances. In fact, music was a living character, a force that captured the protagonists souls and bewitched the audience. It seemed only natural that Chazelle would try a more ambitious project, a full-fledged musical, inspired by the golden age of musical, and that somehow would keep his feet on the ground.Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling play a couple of dreamers who fall in love in the city of dashed dreams. By the time they meet, she has been to too many auditions which led nowhere. He's a lover of jazz, a form of music that doesn't really appeal to the masses, but it is his obsession, and he doesn't appear to be the compromising type. He finds himself often, and he chooses to ignore practicality over dreams. Maybe that's what attracts him to the aspiring actress, or maybe it's the fact that she is a looker and a charmer, with a dash of innocence.The film has them going to parties full of vapid personalities and possible contacts. These parties are at best hollow, expendable, and also serve as backdrop or props for the next musical number. There were times when I wondered how these two characters managed to even become guests in those settings. There are many 'holes' in this musical, and too many instances where one feels like the team is trying too hard to show creativity. He drives an old, loud, and hip convertible. She somehow can afford a Prius with what appears to be a part time job as a barista in, check this, a movie studio.Musicals are about dreams and don't stress reality and accuracy over dreams and the magic of its music and sets, but even 'Singing in The Rain' didn't hold back in its portrayal of the negative in Hollywood. It didn't hold back when showing the prototypes in the parties, and at best, you were part of the help if you ever made into a 'party'. We have seen spontaneous and magical musical numbers take over reality in many films, the ones in here fall short in many ways.Much has been said about the 'freeway' opening number, and I wanted to like it a lot, but there was no fire in the performances, the dancing, or the quite boring setting. There wasn't any particular challenges in the dancing, and the lyrics felt amateurish at best. It wasn't a good beginning for a musical because it didn't even hint at better things to come.'La La Land' improves as it goes on, but the quality of the lyrics remains a problem. The melodies in the smaller numbers fare better, almost approaching lovely a couple of times, and since it's a fantastic with touches of realism, it's pretty sad. The only time I felt like I was really witnessing magic was the bit in the Observatory, conveniently opened after closing hours, and when we're given the alternate 'take' on what their lives could have been.Emma is lovely, and Ryan does a good job portraying the jazz piano player. Romance and chemistry register, and there are moments that show the director and writer understands the world of entertainment, but it also reveals that there's a limit to what he knows. It pains me to compare it 'Singing in The Rain', but that other movie had its heart and mind in the right place, an exuberant song and dance piece that had insights on what lied in the heart of the beast, showing the duplicity in the hearts of some of the members of this world. Dreams came across loud and clear, in vibrant colors. The hunger to belong and be more successful was apparent in the physical routines. 'Fame' which portrayed the world of the aspiring singers and dancers bursts with physical force in all of its numbers. It never needs to call attention to itself.Maybe the problem is that for a musical about making it and trying to keep dreams and love alive in the city of dreams, it does not offer much in the way of magical settings. The brush around the Observatory is not pretty, especially the first time we see them dancing. There are hints of greatness, but they come too far in between.Maybe we want to like it too much, but let's be honest it scores big in effort. It doesn't do too well with the finished project. I kept having flashes of 'The Artist', 'Fame', 'Singing in The Rain', films that delivered in quality both lyrically and visually. I wasn't angry, just disappointed because I wanted to like it more. Maybe a bit more time rehearsing, getting a better lyricist, focusing more, etc. could have made its heart beat with a stronger, more interesting form of energy.",5,21,39,20 December 2016
Super 8," An Instant Summer Classic
","When I first saw the preview and read the teaming of Spielberg and Abrams, I crossed my fingers and hoped it would be much better than the sensational preview. That preview gave us a taste of what was coming, without telling us the entire story or trying to show us the latest dazzling special effects or the new tied-in merchandise. The movie is just what we expected: an exciting, warm, and most satisfying summer adventure/thriller.Most of the film is quite entertaining and amazing for the most part, from the great job done by all the child actors, particularly fanning, who has a difficult role and acts mature beyond her years but manages to retain a hint of innocence. She is part of a group of pre-teens who are engaged in making a super 8 movie, full of cheap and shocking special effects in order to fulfill their dreams and avoid the less than perfect real world situations they have to deal with everyday.The plot is simple, and it has the children, literally becoming part of a scenario involving a rather suspicious train wreck. As the story moves forward, strange events occur around the small town, and soon the children must confront the ever threatening military forces. At this point, it is where the film becomes more interesting because instead of just concentrating on the noise, visuals, and the overwhelming special effects of other summer releases, this one looks inside the relationships between the main characters, and we get to understand their history and might be able to predict the final outcome.Soon, we have friends dealing with love problems, father/son misunderstandings, and some difficult alliances are formed where the audience doesn't have to feel like an uninvited guest to the party where only the actors seem to be enjoying a exchange of 'clever' lines that are only thrilling to them, or the producers and directors hope the lull in the action can be 'improved' by a desperate insert of loud and confusing noisy and poorly choreographed or edited special effects.The train wreck is as thrilling, if not even more sensational than the one in 'The Fugitive', and when things explode, we are treated to some old fashioned cinematic tricks. This time we want to dodge the flying debris, while we hope the actors don't get hurt or mauled. The danger looks and feels genuine, not just a pastiche of very expensive CGI.So, with the combination of good acting, expert directing, and a solid piece good, old fashioned solid screen writing, we have a film that recalls the best of the 70's and 80's classics, a tribute and a refreshing new entry on its own. Both Spielberg and Abrams have added their own personal touches: a sense of never ending wonder, with masterful handling of a mystery that relies more on us participating on its slow revelation than on just a half-cooked attempt at giving us a poorly developed idea.Five stars all the way!!!",10,3,10,11 June 2011
Life Is Beautiful," What an Achievement
","Benigni makes the film. I believe if it had in someone else's hands, it would probably not work, but there is something about this man's facial features. Somehow he connects with you, and yet he's so different from everyone else. Most of us can't conjure fairy tales and magical moments like his protagonist. What we can do is feel fear, love, loyalty, and a lot of the emotions that he sometimes shows and tries to disguise in order not to cause more pain.The story takes us through the separation period of an Italian man from his wife when the Nazis arrest him and his young boy. The father has to create a scenario to protect his young kid from the horrors that surround them. He tells them they are playing a game, and that if they do it right, they will win and see their wife/mom again. It is not so easy to carry out, and with creative gestures and, bewildering, funny lines, we laugh in the middle of this tragedy. Still, we are sad because it's all a fantasy, and the odds are that this will not end well.The most heartbreaking part is the ignorance that is part of many of these characters' lives. His 'friends' appear to be unaware of what is going on. Normal lives continue in an isolated oasis, away from imminent death. Guido tries hard, almost succeeding, and we get to the bittersweet ending, something that will remind many of those doubted this premise was going to work, that this is after the way life works. It's full of surprises, and some of them are not beautiful.There are many winning elements in this film. At the top are the performances of the main characters. We have a lovely score that underscores the extremes that co exist in the same universe. We have the evils of World War II and the beauty of the love between the various members of the family. This is a film that must have been difficult to sell, produce, and realize, but it succeeds and delivers another perspective about that horrible period in history.",8,3,5,8 July 2014
Up," this big heart doesn't have a chance to be heard
","Once again, I shouldn't have trusted that preview, or it might have been that the short before 'Up' was so wonderful, or was it that the mostly silent introduction to our main character was nothing short of glorious... somewhere, though, this film lost its ability to touch in the way other Pixar and animated features have done in the past.'Up' is supposedly about achieving our dreams, discovering who we really are, learning to adapt to the changes life brings to us, and so many other themes that it is a wonder we even recognize them, as the film changes from an intimate portrayal of two lonely people to a rather hectic adventure that barely rises above average.The animation is, of course, superb, and the vocal work by all the people involved is first-rate. Problems arise when we notice than other than the amazing prologue, most of the good stuff has already been show in the preview. The other sections don't quite muster enough emotional power to make us care. For instance, the vistas aren't impressive, the set action pieces near the end don't carry much wallop, and it's hard to have a movie that lacks. The film just feels like some non-threatening film that is paying tribute to movies that had originality and the right tone. I couldn't help wondering what people like Spielberg and Zemeckis could have done with this movie, and the echoes of 'Wall-e' kept haunting me, as I remembered the lyricism of that movie that made us remember what it is like to be human in the middle of all these choking technology. 'Up' doesn't quite take you up for the ride, or make you feel 'up'. There is no cathartic moment, no real payoff, and the best moments are the sentimental moments when pictures of their loving relationship is on the screen.Marketing can do wonders, and this will be a huge moneymaker. Hopefully it will only receive the credit it really deserves, and audiences will be wiser so next, we enjoy something beyond a small, sweet film that couldn't quite give us what we expected.",5,36,87,31 May 2009
Woman in Gold," Seeking Restitution
","Based on the true story of a woman trying to get back her properties more than 50 years after leaving her homeland because of Nazi persecution, 'The Woman in Gold' offers an idea of how difficult it is to fight the big guys, without making the film a complex courtroom drama or diluting every element to make it overly sentimental. In the hands of Reynolds and Mirren, the main players in this drama, we get a satisfying and entertaining movie.Told by mixing contemporary and flashback footage, we learn about the origins of the artwork that Maria is trying to recover from the Austrian government. Her parents, uncle and aunt collected and commissioned art pieces in their prosperous days in Austria, only to see it stolen and appropriated by different people before some of it landed in famous museums. Maria must fight a 'will' written by her aunt (the lady in the portrait), with the help of a young lawyer who might or might not have enough stamina and experience to fight the big legal firms protecting what the other side now claims to be deeply associated with Austrian identity, ignoring a few legal complications along the way.The best part of the film is watching the interaction between Mirren and Reynolds. She's old and tired, with fire in her heart and the disposition to fight whoever blocks her way, but she is also old and tired, and this is beautifully portrayed by Mirren. There's a big heart in her, and she takes on a motherly role to push Reynolds to fight her battle. She's full of tough love, eventually turning the business relationship into something deeper and more meaningful.Reynolds might not have been the most obvious choice for the attorney, but he does a decent job here, showing that he has the spirit to learn and the perseverance to honor or maybe live up to a pair of talented and respected relatives with ties to the Austrian motherland. Something clicks inside of him as he visits that country for the first time, and with the support of his client/friend, he is willing to risk his professional and personal lives to accomplish what many see as an impossible enterprise.The flashbacks are exquisitely done, and the actors portraying the younger Maria and her husband (Max Irons) are very good, especially the younger Maria who resembles Mirren in her looks and attitude. She grows up from a rich and moody socialite to survivor who must find a way to America, a place where she will be able to have a future. Her ties to her family are strong, and her eventual decisions are difficult to make. The recreation of the period is exquisite, and it's always a pleasure to have the movies take us back to the past or to another land, so we can learn a little bit more about ourselves and/or human nature.In conclusion, here is a movie with a message, with entertainment, and with a little bit of history, so that we don't forget and hopefully we won't make the same mistakes again.",9,16,23,6 April 2015
Love & Mercy," A Classic Musical Biography
","'Love & Mercy' is a rare film showing us the artist, the artistry, the joys of creation, and the torture experienced by genius, as it exposes the differences between them and us normal folks. Throughout history many of those artists have been characterized as being strange, abnormal, weird, and at times, sick. Yes, they have special chemistry and aptitude that put them in a very special category, and Brian Wilson, wonderfully played by Dano and Cusack is indeed a special type of man.Throughout his life, Wilson experiences all types of pain, from the overbearing ego of his father who demands too much from him, doesn't know how to express his frustration except through verbal and physical abuse leaving irreversible damage in Wilson's body and psyche. Add to Wilson's background, some type of mental condition which allows him to develop creatively but also exposes him to stimulation overload.Enter a psychiatrist with dubious intentions and an evil/mean streak, and we have plenty of drama, which is added to the already difficult and complex process of creating a masterpiece. For years, the musical talents and success of the Beach Boys have made them very successful. Eventually, they have found a way to dump their father and keep evolving musically. The question is how far are they willing to go, allowing Wilson to try new visionary and experimental sounds. Studio musicians seem to be able to appreciate his new approach. It's problematic for the other members of the band who have come to rely on a successful formula. There are references to how the music business is changing and how other famous bands are inspired by the Beach Boys' harmonies, and how the Beach Boys are willing to try some of that other group's concepts.Watching a song develop from an idea, an emotion, to a series of different takes, adding or dropping sounds, notes, veering from the norm, hearing the basic lyrics and melodies, then watching as layer after layer is added is indeed a breathtaking miracle.There is also the human drama, the encounter of Wilson and the woman who eventually saves him from a horrible fate. Elizabeth Banks is marvelous as the beautiful, insecure woman who can relate to other people in distress and must eventually go beyond what she believes she is capable of doing to fight for the man she loves. As a young Wilson, Dano is a latent time bomb. He is constantly raw, waiting for anything to trigger an anxiety attack or a nervous breakdown. Some see his reactions as maybe those of a fickle artist, but he cries for help, joking that maybe he's already losing it. Sadly, others can't recognize it. Through the use of sounds and visuals, coupled with superb editing, we get a cinema experience that blends the energy of 'Whiplash' with the tension of 'Foxcatcher' and it certainly delivers the artistry and psychological nightmares that a certain theater hinted at.Most impressive is the work of Cusack, as the frail and vulnerable older Wilson. His eyes project pain, ask for help and seem lost as he is exposed to the ravages of medication and abuse by his doctor. Banks is attracted to him, falls in love with him and is helpless for most of the story because even she appears unable to understand how she can get through the legal and psychological baggage she and Wilson carry.It's a great film, one that grabs you, evokes strong emotions and never forgets that at the heart of great work there is a certain degree of pain. It makes you understand how something is born, and much like a human being there's much to endure during delivery and development.",10,1,3,20 June 2015
Don't Breathe," A Night in Hell
","Three teens venture into an old man's to steal his money and find out that it isn't that easy after all. It sounds like a simple premise, but by the movie is over much has happened, and there are plenty of twists and turns along the way.What the two young man and the young lady find is way more dangerous and darker than anyone could expect. To begin, in spite of his blindness, their prey is not as defenseless as they hoped, and soon they become his preys, as he hunts each one of them throughout his home. Suddenly they discover there is one more person in the house, and this person sheds more light on the nature of the old man's motivations.Their battle is long, with the advantage changing through some lucky or unlucky move, and the intensity of their encounters grow as the story goes on, reaching a resolution we suspected but not quite turning out that way. 'Don't Breathe' succeeds because it's thrilling from beginning to end, though we really never get to know much about the characters, there's enough to develop some sympathy for the two parties. Yes, everyone is a criminal to a point, both driven by different types of madness and the need to survive or outsmart each other. Stephen Lang's feature and great physical shape make his ability to deal with the younger people. There are very few lines in the movie, but the conversations are rich, without a wasted moment. Be prepared to stay glued to the screen, waiting, with much suspense threatening to take your breath away.",9,8,17,28 August 2016
Beauty and the Beast," musical magic
","For starters, one can never go in, expecting the level of perfection the original had. In 1991 we were given heaven in the shape of some of the most magical lyrics writtenâ€‹ anywhere. The animation wasn't spectacular, but the film was special and had plenty of soul. It was a great picture. The newest entry has new songs, which are decent but nowhere near as spectacular as the original score. However, the new entry does really well in most instances.The new cast shines providing much of the reality and magic to the living furniture. They, after all, are human. Emma Thompson is strong and sweet. The rest of the cast does a decent job. And there is Belle who in spite of not being a professional singer manages to handle the songs nicely. No superb singing, but she's not a singer, she's alternate misfit. Unlike recent musicals, this is one is touching and fill of memorable and deep interpretations. There's plenty to him along even in the new songs.I like what they added to the story. Tiny bits that give you some insight about many of the main characters. The prince is not just a beast, but a product of his upbringing. Belle is more complicated and with much going on in her heart and mind.The musical adaptation is fantastic. The village opening number will leave breathless and the people behind the art direction, sets, and costumes deserve the highest praise. Gowns look glorious and the sets made me believe we were in the middle of an opulent setting. Great job.Simply, adaptation great films is problematic from the start, yet no misfires here. Condom tops his precious musical entries and manages to keep that soul intact, making us believe in an intelligent romance.",10,8,21,18 March 2017
Sicario," A Sheep in Wolves' Clothing
","I read somewhere that Emily Blunt's part was originally written for a man. After seeing this film, it's something that doesn't make any sense at all for all the heart and sensibility she brings to the role would not exist. It's not about innocent but of complexity and a driven sense of dedication and commitment that have no place in our world anymore.She plays a government agent that through her achievements manages to stand out and catch another agency's eyes. Soon, she's asked to volunteer a take part of a task which might satisfy both, her thirst for justice, and the others' needs. Gradually, she discovers she might have made an unwise move, but the option to back out becomes more and more complicated as the case unfolds.From the ultra violent opening scene to the emotional conclusion, Blunt shows her full potential as a woman who is navigating a truly difficult journey. She's shocked when she 'discovers' the nature of her involvement, but this doesn't prepare it for the surprises that keep coming her way. Clarisse from 'Silence of the Lambs' had a relatively easy time because she was facing her own demons and a monster she admire. She has no devotion to any of the people she's chasing or even worse, the rather muddled plan she's become a part of and which she wants to stop at any costs, just to find out she might even lose her life if she continues her way of thinking.We know from the trailer, she will be facing some despicable people involved in the drug/cartel world. What she doesn't understand is how intertwined good and evil are, and though we know one doesn't exist without the other, the film shows that the lines have become more blurred as we get to learn throughout the film.Blunt is exceptional as the reactor to the unfolding events, and Del Toro is perfect as the mysterious and devious 'Medellin'. Brolin and the rest of the cast do very nicely in minor roles. There are hints at the private lives of these soldiers, yet it's interesting how the only families we get to see are those who are in the 'bad side'. This is important in the end, as we hear that families are key to the heart of the story, and one of them tries to rationalize that anything done has definitely not a personal angle in this dark business world.It's not an easy film to watch because people do get hurt, and it's rare to see any goodness at all. Children aren't shielded from evil, and they're damaged goods no matter which side they belong to. Look at the last scene. Still, there's good in here, and Blunt is part of the little there is, but it's her counterpart that surprises us the most because even in this world of darkness there's a little bit of hope among the wolves for a little lost lamb.",9,3,8,27 September 2015
Departures," Dare you not to love this movie
","The first time I knew this film was special was when it received a very special award a few months ago, beating the favorite to win, but there was something about the description and the preview that intrigued me. After seeing this sublime piece, I have to say you'll be missing out if you don't do the same.'Departures' plays like a lovely symphony, carries you like a breeze, with its exquisite and touching direction, flawless and sensitive performances, and one of most memorable and beautiful scores ever to accompany a film. There are so many moments during this movie that one can't help but feel a connection with the most powerful of our feelings, wanting to surrender and rewire ourselves to be able to express our emotions in ways we have forgotten.A frustrated musician needs a job and happens to be hired in as a man who gets the deceased ready for their funeral rites, apparently a job that many people consider below respectable standards. As we discover during the film, our protagonist has his own appreciation of what this new position means, and little by little, we learn, pretty much like he does, that there is more to the job than we originally understood.Luckily for him, he finds some supportive and well developed characters along the way who show him how to restructure his life again, among them is his lovely and charming wife who is probably one of the nicest characters ever on a film. There are the mother and father figures, who give him some long forgotten knowledge, and he learns much as he assists the families of the people he works on.In the end, after a pretty strong cathartic conclusion, there is most likely not a single dry eye in the house; yet one doesn't feel manipulated in any way, but grateful we were able to accompany him during his reevaluation of what life and love are. 'Departures' deserves every accolade, recognition, award, and praise it receives because it explores our humanity, asking us to revisit what makes us what we are, and ways in which we can become much better than what we are.",10,2,4,6 June 2009
Some Like It Hot," ultimate comedy
","Jack Lemmon is downright hilarious in this one because he plays his role with gusto and seriousness. There are moments in this film so crazy, so impossible to believe, and yet, because of this man's superb acting job, we are in comedy heaven. Lemmon's Daphne is one of the most incredible and masterful acting jobs in the history of cinema. His comedic exchanges with each of the other actors in this film are a wonder to witness. When he is with Monroe, we never doubt he has become possessed by the spirit of his creation. Minutes after his engagement, watching him plan his wedding is a riot, and no one can keep a straight face while he is dancing with his soon-to-be fiancé.Billy Wilder once again proved his talent as one of the most multi-talented directors in Hollywood as he guided all the members of his troupe to this terrific films. One can only wonder if this can ever be replicated in any way.Give yourself a treat and enjoy a film that was a classic the minute it came out, and it only gets better with time... 25 years since!",10,2,3,17 August 2005
Jack Reacher," Another Cruise Surprise
","Tom Cruise takes on challenging projects. All I heard and read about was that he wasn't a good fit for the part because of the physical differences in size, height, etc., and by the time the film ended, I have to admit that I couldn't have cared less what the character looked like on the printed page. What matter was that Cruise carried the picture quite well, with sheer determination to convince the audience this was a man who was able to think independently and most importantly, that others should take seriously.Cruise wanders into the middle of a conspiracy to help the authorities bring the guilty parties to justice. He becomes a crime suspect as the investigation deepens, and he has a couple of close calls as the film reaches its explosive conclusion. 'Reacher' feels like a 70's thriller. It's intelligent, with enough intrigue and twists to make the audience think and keep us engaged. It doesn't talk down to you, is full of elaborate and unbelievable plot turns. It has the perfect balance of action with the terrific car chase and old fashioned ambush, and there are very intelligent conversations as he and his lawyer friend (Pike) figure what is really happening.Cruise might not look like a young action hero anymore, but that hasn't stopped people like Ford and Neeson from scoring big at the box office, and now he is showing some strength in the way he portrays his characters. I'm glad they left out the romantic element, and we see more of a camaraderie or sympathy towards his female colleagues. There is a very touching scene involving a woman who tells him that she expects that kind of mistreatment, and we see through his eyes that he knows exactly what is happening.Pike is excellent as the attorney who gets trapped in the middle of the conspiracy. She is strong but shows enough vulnerability to carry the final scenes. We are not witnessing the birth of a superwoman, but instead there is this modern, intelligent and analytical human being who knows the situation might be troublesome, but she won't run away or act like the typical damsel in distress.I was particular impressed with the cinematography and the music. It validated my belief that Hollywood, when it tries really hard, is able to bring back an era, or the feel of one. Yes, we have cell phones here, but with the inclusion of the Camaro, and the way the camera zooms in and out of some alleys and the quarry scene, I felt like I was looking back at some of Friedkin's or Coppola's best dramatic work. There are scenes where you can almost feel the spirit of 'The Conversation' come to life, and it is almost impossible to recreate that car chase in 'The French Connection', but I had fun watching this tribute.'Jack Reacher' is a very good film, and I wouldn't mind seeing one or two more sequels in the series.",9,4,15,23 December 2012
Les Misérables," Les Horribles
","I went into this film with high hopes since the cast has some very talented actors, and then I remember it was a musical, and most of these people can't sing. 'Phantom of the Opera' had a similar problem with its lead performer; however the leading lady was superb, and the direction quite spectacular, and it didn't hurt that the songs were good. That's not the case with this big, horrible mess.In addition to being one of the most boring movies ever made, there is very little to like beside some sets and costumes, and the fact that Hugh Jackman can hold a note for almost a minute. Other than that, Hathaway overacts, Crowe looks disturbed most of the film and appears to be missing something. I can't even find words to describe the emotions I discovered with Helena and Sasha. They finally met their match. For years, these two have survived a few cinematic bombs, but this movie is the equivalent of the Black Plague... Very little is left standing.With a camera that seems to be on some type of epileptic seizure, a very truncated story line, and one of the most incredibly unappealing and forgettable song scores of the last hundred years, it's hard to enjoy something that calls itself a musical, but doesn't quite have anything remotely close to a melody. For more than two hours, one hears something akin to the scratching of nails on a blackboard, and why does everyone wear so much rouge? A few years ago the director gathered some of the best British and Australian talent and won a Best Picture Oscar with a very weak film. This type the trick doesn't work because the material and the direction are outstandingly weak.If the musical genre doesn't suffer a painful death after this, nothing will be able to kill it. If Jackman's character got 19 years in jail for stealing a loaf of bread, I can't even imagine what a judge would give the producers and directors for creating this tuneless torture. Fantine was lucky to meet her maker in the first 20 minutes... We had to endure 2.5 hours of this horrible experience.",2,89,169,12 January 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Father and Son Connection
","The first 'Guardians of the Galaxy' was a welcome surprise, with engaging characters, funny lines, and a great portrayal of friendship in the most unexpected places. Times goes on, and relationships evolve and deepen in most cases. So in the end, there's plenty of action, back stories are connected, and it sort of makes sense.The gang is at the center of mess started by Rocket when he steals some valuable items from their employers. Retaliation promptly involves a gang of thugs in pursue of our gang, and things become more complicated with the arrival of Peter's long lost father. This results in a series of interesting moments between father and son, but there's a nagging feeling that something doesn't fit, or that the whole truth is not out being told. The mystery keeps the story going, until the explosive revelations in the last section of the film.The same elements that made the original successful are back, with everyone still displaying affection for each other in their own peculiar way. Rocket is rough at the edges but can't hide his soft side. There's plenty of cuteness in Baby Groot, and Saldana and Pratt are still working out the 'unspoken' aspects of their relationship.One should enjoy the visuals for most of the film, and the story unfolding with the best coupling of pop music and a story line since 'Mamma Mia'. There's a sense of nostalgia that wasn't present in the first film, and using some obscure pieces makes their success even more interesting.The bottom line is this works well, and we're looking forward to Groot's next growing phase.",9,28,47,8 May 2017
The Da Vinci Code," Flawed but Not Boring At All
","After having read some of the early publicity on this film, I headed out to a screening of the film with a bit of hesitation since I expected a big, boring, convoluted mess. Add to that, the unexciting and hesitant direction of Howard in both 'Cinderella Man' and 'The Missing', I was ready for the worst possible experience. I was surprised when I became engrossed by a film that moved very nicely and was very faithful to its written source.Most of the film is in fact, very entertaining, and it is enough of a minefield to make a few people quite nervous along the road. It keeps its central premise, which will keep people arguing over the possibilities of historical cover-up for quite a while. In fact, seeing some of the arguments, presented visually will probably have a much stronger impact than some of the prose in Brown's novel. There are some handsome flashbacks depicting some of the elements of the cover-up, and the fact that now we see the road to discovery that our leading couple must take to 'uncover' the truth makes the experience more believable; the power of cinema is indeed great.So, why does the entire experience feels a bit like we've been cheated? It's not Hanks (or his hairdo's) fault. He plays his role very well, and his co-stars are delightful because their characters are for a change well developed. Another positive aspect of the film is the fact that Howard's direction is this time more on target, allowing us to relish the moments where witty, intellectual exchanges are happening. Academics can be proud that their depiction in the film makes them look like real people who seem to know their subject matter. McKellen's character is memorable because there he is fully dimensional, not the collaboration of a research group who is trying to appeal to as many possible teenagers in an opening night. It was truly refreshing to see a film where scenes were framed and the camera-work wasn't the result of an appeal to an ADD-afflicted audience or filmmaker. Watching a thriller where we see what is 'happening' on the screen is more effective that quick cuts that are trying to give us an illusion of action and poorly executed attempts at being clever.There are some problems in the last third of the film, where we are witnesses to some rather upsetting liberties taken by Mr. Goldman who couldn't leave its good source material alone. It is distressing to see how some of the ends were 'quickly' tied at the end, an some of the resolution has taken a turn that was apparently tacked on to push more buttons but look more superfluous than anything else. Goldman was either experiencing a lack of confidence in the strength of Brown's subtle ending, or maybe he was looking to showcase his talents as an adapter who can't leave the integrity of the source alone. Do we really need to see more of 'followers' there at the Chapel? Wasn't her performance strong enough? Also, what in the world is going with the dynamics of the relationship of the members of the radical order? It is especially in this section where we question the integrity of a filmmaker who can't handle controversy...The film works mostly because it does serve an intelligent thriller with a premise that might open up interest in looking back at history and ourselves for sign of sorely missed intelligence in contemporary films that ironically seem of to be of anything else but intellligence. 'The Da Vinci Code' gives us proof that there is still some true talent in Hollywood, that it believes good acting can still make a film a success. It is time we go back and revisit good, old fashioned screen writing, competent use of technical effects in both visual and computerized craftmanship to serve the whole, instead of just overpadding the film with flashy visual and sound effects, that end up becoming the center of attention. Here technology serves a purpose, other than numbing our common sense, our brains, and our abilities to enjoy intellectual questions.The film has a tough road because it needs to appeal to those who read the novel, and those didn't but wonder what the hoopla is all about. Maybe there will be a succession of related theme projects, and let's welcome them if they induce a little thinking from our side, and hopefully it prods the so called Hollywood crowd to move away from pure marketing to what is required from those who want to be recognized as true artists in the medium.",7,1,5,19 May 2006
Titanic," Cameron Sets a New Standard for 3D Quality
","15 years after this classic first hit, it's back, and now it looks and sounds better than ever, and some recent releases look so muddy and artificial in comparison. Here Cameron uses his expertise to improve on the technical aspects of 'Titanic' without sacrificing what already worked. Nothing gratuitously calls attention to the new '3D' transfer. Instead, it enhances the gorgeous and meticulously produced movie. The spectacle glows with renewed strength, and each performance, each costume, each set now looks remarkable, all contributing what a true cinematic experience should be.As everyone knows, our stars are not reciting Shakespeare. The focus is on the relationship, and how two young people connect with each other. Surrounding them is cast of real and fictional character that gives us a little insight into what it was like being in the doomed ship. People look and act the part. Each class defined by the parameters of their own creation. Cameron understands the passengers on this ride. Zane, Bates, De Caprio and Winslet all do remarkable work, and it's still a question why De Caprio wasn't recognized by his peers when the film first came out. He is central to the success of this confection.In the end, the film, like the title will go on, having us choke on the emotional highs, the times when we understand what gives us humanity and hope, and when we see that humans share so much and are so far from perfect, but we just keep on going, and we will have dreams even after the worst of nightmares.It deserves repeated viewings and much praise. Thank you, Mr. Cameron.",10,3,6,4 April 2012
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," You Know Who... W O W
","I have been looking forward with the new chapter of the series with much anticipation, and though Mike Newell is one of my favorite British directors, I was rather anxious. My opinion now is that he should take the series all the way to the end because he has done a formidable job conjuring all the types of magic to make this great film.There is much to praise in this film: From the lead teenagers to the entire sporting cast, all of whom are at the turning point of the Harry Potter storyline. Now, their lives will never be the same, as they grow up and most confront the fears within themselves, and the most terrifying villain in the movies in the last decade. Ralph Fiennes brings to life a rather repulsive and malevolent creation that instills fear in both its prey and the audience. He fascinates as he destroys. From its original mention in Book I, we have been waiting to see who is the mastermind behind the attacks to Harry, and now we're face to face with a character few people would like to have an argument with. The fifteen minutes or so Harry and Voldemort share the screen are disturbing and wonderful, full of emotions that give depth to the stories but were neglected in the first two films, and barely stirred in 'Azkaban'. Things are indeed changing, and there is no turning back. There is some humor in the film, and the characterizations are much better than before. Our heroes have grown, the vistas have grown richer, the music more sublime, and just like everything else both the forces of good and evil are stronger and getting ready for the final battle. There is still much energy and story left, and if the directors keep the pace, we will not be disappointed.There is so much to like in the film:<ul><li>The World Cup of Quidditch (fantastic) - Hermoine's and Ron's exchanges - The Cemetery Scene - The Tournament's Three Challenges...</li></ul>As I mentioned before, I could talk about it for a while, and I couldn't do it justice. Thank you J.K. Rowling for your amazing creations, and we're much indebted to you, Mr. Newell for finally capturing the spirit of Potter and sharing with us. It's indeed a treat!",10,0,1,19 November 2005
The Godfather: Part III," Heartbreak
","In the saga of 'The Godfather' it became unimaginable to believe Coppola could top his two previous achievements. Part I and Part II shine because of their terrific performances, but the films as a whole needed some serious editing, and there were problems with the pacing. Most of those aspects were fixed in the third installment, and the performances continued to be pretty flawless, with the exception of Sofia Coppola, a last minute replacement for the I wonder what she could have done with the role Winona Ryder. Coppola is not bad, but she can't match the sterling work by Paccino, Hamilton, Keaton, a magnificent supporting cast, and especially the dark turn by Talia Shire, who takes a role that would have made Lady Macbeth a serious attack of paranoia.This film is a visual stunner, and it brings together the best of the previous two movies, as musical themes are revived, key plot points are revisited in order to explore the dynamics of the present time drama. The audience knows Michael Corleone will never be able to achieve respectability because of his previous dealings. It is impossible to him to repair the familial bonds as Kate (Keaton) returns in a dashing performance to advocate for the future of her son against the will of her ex-husband. She still hesitates and fears him, but she is willing to confront him. To add an explosive touch to the mix, enter Andy Garcia, the soon to be heir to the Corleone empire, and whose ties to the family are already problematic to begin with.'III' shines in more ways than one, with its traditional first act, presenting the players, the series of turning points in the middle that set up the grandiose last act, where dialog is kept to a minimum and events keep unfolding to the tragic end, a scene that will break more than a few hearts in the audience, as Michael, an ruthless icon of power discovers that his world has been shattered in a way he will be unable to manipulate.'Godfather III' is just the right way to end a great story.",9,3,6,24 June 2008
The Fountain," Is it all coming from her book or his mind?
","Unlike 'Requiem' I found this film to be upsetting, upsetting because the style overpowered its substance. In 'Requiem' the universe and many of its forces are destroyed by the fragility of our abilities to resist the darkness that can annihilate us. It is tragic to see how four individuals are ripped to pieces as drugs take over their lives. There is, ironically, beauty in the way the director presented that horrible tragedy.Here we are dealing with more beauty, but it is all disfigured by the presentation, a movie that should have immeasurable power, is delivered mangled by the way, magnificent performances, a lovely score, and a terrific idea, fall secondary to some very interesting special effects and some confusing editing. There is so much potential in the way the story hints come across, and somehow, we are left with a very repetitive delivery of sequences that do not have any new meaning as more is 'revealed' about the story line. Instead, they feel repetitive and burdensome.The effect is puzzling because we have some strong acting by both Jackman and his leading lady, Weitz. They look believable and shouldn't become a problem because they are fantastic actors and not stars. They are attractive and effective in their parts, and here is where the problems are. Their acting doesn't complement or enhance the story. It shows how weak the narrative is.It starts promising, as we are witnessing some spectacular and violent odyssey in the middle of the Mayan lands, soon we're pulled into some existential worlds that might or not exist, and before we know it, we are dealing with some tremendous amount of suffering and guilt, and yet, it feels hollow as the film never takes flight.There should be more buy in about the power of their love since it appears to transcend time and matter, but a terrific score and very good acting is not nearly enough in this case. There is not enough concern with the need for a great script. It is not all a matter of style. It should be a perfect marriage of both. Too bad, since this film was coming with so many expectations. Maybe next time, we can get some more of the real thing.",6,0,3,23 November 2006
The Departed," Slow and first but then it's a wild ride
","Scorcese does it again, delivering again quality entertainment that is flashy and exciting but needs a bit more heart. The beginning of the movie hints at what could have done to make it better. All in all, the result is quite a piece of entertainment, with some outstanding performances, in particular De Caprio and Damon as the two sides of a character that is heavily manipulated by circumstances and a Faust-like figure.Damon, in particular, is very good in the way he portraits an ambitious yet hesitant corrupt police officer. He is a despicable character, who still manages to pull a few sympathetic punches. De Caprio is upstaged by Damon a few times, but he is still very effective. Nicholson presents another variation of his naughty persona, with a twist of evil to make it interesting enough.The man in charge is definitely Scorcese, still at his best with material that involves deceit, violence, and plenty of crime. The movie moves very well most of the time. The final 30 minutes are superb, but in perfect and unfortunate counterbalance, the first 1/2 hour is a bit thin and slow.It could have been an instant classic. Instead, it's a very good film. Enjoy it.",8,0,0,15 October 2006
Glory Road," Inspirational, Moving, and Exciting
","Contemporary films have fallen into two categories: Important and Irritating. Important films are 'apparently' whatever is nominated for the Oscars or is never seen by anyone in the country, except those people who live in the big cities. Irritating is just about any silly effort by the Studios to catch on the latest trend or to make outrageous amount of money without being creative.'Glory Road' is an important film because it tackles with issues that shaped our society and paved the way for positive changes into the fabric of our lives. It is set in the recent past, and some of its images reawaken the horror many in this country experienced. It is realistically portrayed, with fine characterization, and simple storytelling that presents its main points in direct and accessible ways. We are entertained as we learn about the past, and how we can prevent it from hurting us in the future.Josh Lucas and the rest of the supporting cast do a fine job reenacting an era that hasn't been long and forgotten. I'd rather see a movie of this caliber and with such a big heart that stand around, waiting for the latest soulless remake. 'Glory Days' might not break any new ground, have the stamp of a famous director, break any new box office records, but it's moving, as it touches its audience with a message that is relevant and carries hope and many other positive qualities.It's an exceptional film.",10,4,15,22 January 2006
The Witch," Old Fashioned Horror
","It's been a while since we have been treated to classic movie making, a period piece where there's strong emphasis on shaping well-defined characters that go beyond simple sketches and are able to project various types of emotions, draw us into the drama, which in this case is more intense than recent releases because it takes time to develop but is firmly grounded on its themes and takes big chances, using realistic dialogue, natural cinematography, and some pretty incredible costumes.'The Witch' succeeds because everything in it is carefully tended. The opening scenes have the community dealing with a religious crisis. The camera moves around showing every detail of the austere life this community lives. They live under strict rules, in a new but dangerous world, and we have just learned, one of its members chooses to leave the safety of the small settlement and try their luck near the cold, dark, and very scary forest.As if the world wasn't full of extreme situations that involve hard work, raising cattle, growing crops, and having a severe case of bad luck, there is someone living inside the dark forest, someone who might eventually destroy each and everyone of this family. At the beginning, crops start going bad, the animals sense some mysterious force is approaching, and a very young baby is snatched away by 'the wolves', but it soon becomes clear that there is no animal, but a supernatural being that manages to becomes stronger after committing a terrible deed, something that must have taken a lot of debating before it made it to the screen.Events continue, taking each of the members through a slow decay of their inter-relationships. At the center of this is the young girl who is blamed for the loss of her younger brothers, the very strange twins whose behavior hints at some type of dark influence, a guilt-ridden mother whose faith is faltering, and a father who is seeing how his world is about to implode.The film is as naturalistic as it can be, and this makes the horrors appear stronger and very real. The branches of the trees are haunting and alive with forces we don't understand, but this is no art piece, and when nature (in the shape of otherwise, innocent looking creatures) strikes, we know we're dealing with something that will most likely cause a lot of destruction.The world is a cold and nasty place; it's always gray. The sun never shines, and the wind looks like it might just kill you. The night scenes are spooky, and we don't feel safe, completely relating to what the various characters go through. Making the situation worse is that there are children involved, and we are witnesses to a quick deterioration of whatever strength the parents might have. Soon, we see how the forces around them begin to create divisions among them.Another family member is abducted in one of the most shocking scenes in modern cinema, slowly leading to more horrific events, each of them striking even harder than the one before. The film is so powerful that it even uses one of the most popular representations of evil, and it is as if we've never seen it before. When we realize who or what it is, we know we are in the middle of the circles of hell. Much will be said about the ending, but since we have grown used to this great directorial effort, giving us a carefully designed and powerful film, we might excuse the flight of fancy that takes the last minutes of the film. Yet, if that being's intervention looked and felt real, why isn't it possible that we believe that such a situation is possible.One of the best films of the year so far.",10,8,17,24 March 2016
Jersey Boys," The Music is the Soul of This Film
","One can't help but join in the joyful portrayal of these classic songs. Yes, Eastwood has adapted the play into a very good musical, with his usual restraint and an amazing attention to detail. We are treated to an old fashioned musical but with an interesting twist. The songs weren't written for the movie or the musical; they were integrated into it, and we get to see where they come from, who wrote them, who performed them, and whatever the main characters were going through at the time.It's interesting to see the background of Valli, and how he put family and loyalty ahead of everything else. He was always grateful for the favors people did for him, leading him to take on the arduous task of paying a gargantuan amount of money incurred by one of his friends. The story shows him from a naive 16-year old to his sixties when he reunites with the band for his induction into the hall of fame.The road to success was colorful, and this is where we learn about The Four Seasons' association with some infamous people. Some of the members had records (and not the musical ones), and Frankie ended up asking for favors from some people your mother wouldn't advise you to be seen with. 'Jersey Boys' does show all of this a rather benign way because this is after all not 'Macbeth' or 'Madama Butterfly', but there are exhilarating highs (each one of the musical numbers), and some very sad scenes dealing with family issues and the low points of their career.Overall, the performances are golden, and the singing is very good. Chills will go down your spine when you hear the first performances of the film, and 'Sherry', 'Big Girls Don't Cry' are plenty of fun to see performed live. The true highlight of the movie is the rendition of 'Can't Take My Eyes Off You', a number that revived Valli's career and allowed him to go back where he belonged.It's not a perfect film, but a highly enjoyable one, well directed and performed, and with an impeccable production. You will not believe your eyes when you see the sets, costumes, and the art direction that is shown here. It was almost like time a bittersweet nostalgic ride to a time where people were a little more innocent.",8,1,22,21 June 2014
The Holiday," A very Likable Bunch
","Nancy Meyers can make them like they used to. This old fashioned comedy shows the talents of an interesting quartet of movie stars that do very well playing relatively normal people. Cameron Diaz continues to do well with light comedic parts, and Winslett, is of course, a fantastic actress who appears to be able to handle just about any genre. The revelations are Black and Law, who haven't really handled romantic with this much finesse. They're both charming and look like they've been doing this for a long time. There is something engaging about Black, and how he can portray an everyday man very well. Law who has tried this before, glows this time out.The film is both touching and funny, and what makes it work is the good chemistry between each of the two pairs of leads. As a n added bonus, there's a great turn by Elli Wallach, as the representative of a generation that is not being honoured in Hollywood anymore, that of the writer with the insight. He charms his new friend (Winslett), and through her, we experience what most movies now lack, heart and the ability to connect through good and clever dialogue.In the end, 'The Holiday' is not much more than a cute, romantic film, something that we'd like to see more of, a return to a time where everything works out at the end, with the necessary bumps of course.",9,4,8,15 January 2007
Zero Dark Thirty," Be Prepared to
","Well, this was certainly an improvement over the overrated predecessor / prequel. For the first hour, watching the film was the equivalent of enduring the torture shown in the film, much worse... In fact, I have never seen so many people get up and go to the bathroom or get some much needed caffeine. Mercifully, this very long film has a very good second act, but it doesn't redeem the rest of this film.There is attention to detail but very little suspense/dramatic flair for the first two thirds of the film, as we just witness plenty of conversations, meetings, kind of see the process that leads to the ultimate find of the century. Unfortunately, unlike the much better 'Argo', it is all shown with no regard to pacing. Much of the acting here consists of frowns, a couple of frustrated stares and the inclusion of a couple of expletives to spice up the dialogue. Personally, I don't know how these type of words make anyone look either tough or intelligent. Some people have been impressed by the type of acting we see here, but acting is supposed to provoke some type of feedback from the audience other than drowsiness. Mercifully, the director places a couple of suicide attacks when we are about to collapse from exhaustion, and interesting enough, we don't really care what happens to the people in those scenes.Unlike, Affleck's film, we never really get to understand the background of the people involved, particularly the film's protagonist. It's almost like if we are supposed to develop empathy, but other than some pouting and some cutesy scrawling on a piece of glass, we don't seem much emotional range here. Yes, there's a sole tear at the end, and an honest exchange between Maya and her boss when he demands to know what else she has done before, and the answer is as puzzling to him as it is to the audience.We do get to visit more exotic locales, rarely get to know who inhabits these regions. They're nothing else but pieces of the art decoration in the movie. To be fair, many of the American agents are nothing but stereotypes. I read somewhere that this heroine and some of the colleagues where compared to the people of 'The Silence of the Lambs', and that the unraveling of the events here is similar to 'All The President's Men' drama, and the truth is that people who made that evaluation should go back and study Pakula's masterpiece, a film that gave us personal involvement, intrigue, and exposed the audience to all the participants' nature. We felt the fear of those who dared to speak. We understood the way deep throat made his approaches, and the difficulties encountered by the reporters. Nothing like that occurs here. We might as well be viewing a bad travelogue where the camera zooms in and out of the different locations, but we don't even talk to the locals.However, the whole thing is not lost because when the much, much, much awaited mission finally arrives, we are treated to very good scenes, and things finally pick up. From the moment we see the specially designed aircraft to the scene when the final identification is made, we are treated to almost a completely different film. There is tension, suspense, some very effective editing, and events hit with the right impact, even the technical aspects of the film are renewed with much more dynamic energy. It is dark, and we feel the claustrophobia of the night vision goggles. We finally dread and welcome the force of the explosives. We have human faces and emotions on the faces of both parties. There is a very touching scene involving a soldier and a child. And, we have the imminent race against the clock, as the enemy forces are about to arrive. Now the explosions make sense, and we only wished the rest of the film matched this.Overall, character development is very poor, and the story suffers from endless repetition. It is the reenactment of one very important historical event, but it has not been given the proper treatment. Thankfully, other Hollywood talent has put together projects that deal with similar themes, offer us more information and enough historical exposure to what leads to actual events. I was one of many who got up and cheered when the plane flew out of the danger zone in that other film; this time I was just cheering because the ordeal was finally over and I could run out of the theater.",3,42,87,4 January 2013
Steve Jobs," Talented? Not Charming At All
","If there's a reason to see this movie, it is: Michael Fassbender,a performer who channels the essence of the character, be it real or fictitious. His addict in 'Shame' seduces everything in sight and breaks your heart when one realizes how corroded his existence is. The tortured man in '12 Years a Slave' befuddles us with the love/hate affair, full of guilt that he carries on with one of his slaves. Here, he portrays an iconic figure that very few people really knew but many endured. If we can say the adaptation is based on factual evidence, we can certainly pity the individuals who got too close. According to the film, he felt he had enough talent to believe in himself and his creations. It seemed as if he didn't appreciate their contributions but used them. One particularly upsetting moment in the film has him threatening one of his former partners/employees, failing to admit or recognize the other's contributions. It feels like he's running a plantation, with employees being nothing more than slaves. There's very little to like about this man.Then we have the family angle, and it's even more problematic because even though he is given information in numbers, he still chooses to believe whatever he wants. It doesn't matter that his daughter hears or sees the poison coming out of his mouth. Even his faithful assistance tries to find ways to lessen the possible psychological damage to the child, but it seems to matter little to him until the child 'plays' with one of his programs. Then he chooses to reward her.There are other moments when you wonder what's going on in this film. It's like the stage is set to show us how idolized he is. However, we can't help feeling it's all a set up. Are these real people or hired help to fill the auditorium? You can never feel even admiration. It's all choreographed to look like something, with little emotional resonance.Overall, it's pretty hollow, with pretty, snappy dialogue, a very good performance by Fassbender but not much more, except two very long hours filled with what seems to be much earned devotion.",6,1,2,25 October 2015
Crazy Heart," Masterful Performance by Bridges
","There have been times when a great performance pushes the level of a film that is barely mediocre to 'overrated'; thankfully this is nowhere near the case here. Here is a performance that can not be praised enough, with plenty of emotional force, subtle, skillful, and at times, overwhelming in its depiction of a man whose spirit has lost its way, and who might not know what to do with a second chance.Bridges has proved himself one of our best actors around, with plenty of bravado and sexiness in 'Against All Odds', and much innocence and wonder in 'Starman'. One is bound to be entertained and not cheated in any movie he might be a part of. What he has achieved in 'Crazy Heart' is at times indescribable because it is an accomplished performance, a rich, heartbreaking, exhilarating turn. With the camera on him at all times, there is no room for a false move, and this man delivers something to be treasured.'Bad' is a man who has lived hard and played even harder. He is suddenly facing the consequences of his actions, and when given a couple of hard wake up calls and the opportunity to find some real happiness, he is not able to make the best choices. The question here is whether he is going to be able to conquer his demons or fade away in a haze of alcoholism and despair.There is some pretty good direction and acting here, and it is not all Bridges'. His entire supporting cast is strong and sensitive, especially Colin Farrell, as the young man who tries to come through for his mentor but is having a tough time getting there.'Crazy Heart' is not your typical country biopic, or a lesser attempt at building much out of nothing. It explores real emotions and human flaws. It doesn't want to teach anything, but it lets us in as observers, and we might be able to come up with our conclusions while listening to some good music and watching some great performances.",10,3,8,8 January 2010
War of the Worlds," Top notch Sci-Fi Entertainment
","Here's finally a remake that gets it right! Spielberg's most assured direction together with one of the most terrifying scores since 'Jaws' and some of the most outstanding visual and sound effects ever in a film results in a fantastic evening at the movies.The film deviates very little from the original novel by keeping the spirit intact and paying full homage to HG Wells' descriptions of the invaders' nature and weaponry. Spielberg and his screenwriters don't sanitize the material by taking the ugliness from the devastation brought by the invaders and the disintegration of human values in its aftermath. There is true despair, horror, and paranoia going full blast in every scene of the film. Every emotion runs high.Movie lovers around the world should rejoice and appreciate a fine work of art that works as a great action film. Spielberg has once again shows why he has lasted so long in this business. There is fine support by all the members of its cast, particularly Miss Fanning whose range keeps expanding and delighting moviegoers all over the world.",10,2,9,30 June 2005
12 Years a Slave," Right on Your Face
","A real life story of a man who was victim of the society of the times, a world where the color of your skin set you back in the eyes of many, and that allowed passions and injustice to rise to levels so dangerous, even those who knew right from wrong fear to speak up. Imagine what it must have felt for African Americans who were seen by many as the property of the rich, who had no rights, and who lived in constant fear of being killed, abused, or at least treated as a human being of the worst kind.A 'free' man is somehow kidnapped and taken back to the South for profit. Once he is outside of the safe haven where he has lived all his life, he has no resources as no one will offer him help of any kind. Soon, the audience become witness to different degrees of torture, abuse, rape, and the mistreatment of this man. He loses his voice and the ability to defend himself for any sort of belligerence and rebellion will result in more unjust punishment.There are those masters who recognize the evil at the core of the whole concept of slavery, but money rules this world, and as long as these types of contract are produced, the humanity of the slaves disappears. If there is a way to lessen the level of disgrace is to transfer them into a similar type of hell; at least they won't be killed. Here is where the movie excels by presenting the different types of personalities who supported this society: from the coldhearted businessman who sees nothing but dollars to the tortured plantation owner who struggles with his position but does very little to end the situation. Then there is the indifferent types, and the conflicted simpletons who end up in positions of power and are subject to emotional conflicts and mood swings.The cast is universally top notch, with strong support in the technical areas to evoke an era that has not been gone for too long. We see the recreations of plantations, both inside and outside, the reenactment of atmospheres where lack of tolerance takes a secondary spot to humiliation of the worst type.You will have a front row seat to lashings and all sorts of unspeakable acts, of peeking at the soul of man in love with a slave and himself a slave of what society offers him: he's the master of his property and the slave of a world he doesn't understand but that he must serve.The film is a work of art that sometimes asks too much from its audience. It is not perfect but close to it; yet it might be its power that is overwhelming or just a strong reminder of what we are capable to creating, enduring, and that we must struggle to resist and conquer.",8,1,6,26 October 2013
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," I have seen Jesus!
","This is a film that made my day, put a smile on my face, and made me believe in films again. One goes to the movies to be entertained, to see something that doesn't happen everyday, and Hollywood, as of lately, seems to be think there are only two types of good movies: The ones that make a ton of money, or the ones with a 'serious' message that end up winning all the awards. Apparently, the other ones aren't good enough, and boy, are they neglecting most of the good stuff.For starters, this is a joy to watch. It has the same tone of 'The Breakfast Club' a whimsical and true recollection of what it is like to be a young person, searching for companionship and understanding, and still not bound by society's adult demands. When the characters interact in the film, there is much fun to be had, even when the practical options are well, more logical. Kids go out, meet, enjoy a good concert, have too much to drink and have consequences to deal with, but it's all lighthearted, and everyone knows it's some sort of imaginary fantasy.After all, people don't fall in love in seconds, and you don't get to have all your dreams come true overnight, but where else are you going to have a piece of chewing gum with that kind of history? Then there is the chemistry between the two leads, something that is rare in movies nowadays, one that offers you an insight into the working brain of two young people with much more than sex and special effects in the script.People will talk about this film for a while because it is enjoyable, fresh, and something worth discussing. It has a couple of shocking moments, but they are funny moments, silly stops on the trip that Nick and Nora allows us to become a part of. As they said in '39 'follow the y...' wait a minute, wrong movie, but same ton of fun.",9,52,77,2 November 2008
Wedding Crashers," Quality Crashing
","I have been hearing rumors about this movie for a long time, about its themes, some 'colorful' scenes and a audiences' reactions. The preview wasn't as exciting as I expected, but I have always been fun of Wilson and Vaughn, and who could resist the pairing of Walken and Seymour? So I decided to spend my hard earned money and partake of the communal experience. In the end, I have to say that I wasn't completely disappointed because this film has some truly hilarious moments, and the chemistry between some of the principals works very well. It even has some classy cinematography and art direction... even some really good acting.The concept behind he film works very well because there is the depiction of friendship and the various relationships in the family members feels real and honest; though leaving out the artistic brother wouldn't have made much of an impact.Wilson and McAdams have work very well together, taking us along as they develop a sweet and touching relationship. There are some genuinely touching moments as they take simple walks along the fantastic estates.True, I attended this film, expecting a raunchy, crass, hilarious, and downright bawdy time, and there were scenes that fulfilled my expectations. What made me enjoy the movie even more was that the filmmakers considered that taking those aspects too far would have resulted in overkill and another dumb teenager flick. Their film was 90% good, and I just wished that the unexpected and rather unwelcome one-note cameo in the movie had been taken out. It wasn't necessary, reeked of lack of talent and almost sank the film. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are good actors and comedians, capable of emoting emotions beyond loud and simian screams. Maybe the inclusion of the character in question will highlight this performer's fault and lead to his eventual removal from a business that has suffered in the past year of lack of originality and too much reliance in marketing research that takes the usual way out. True, a series like 'Faces of Death' provokes some type of sick attraction, but that doesn't necessarily reflect quality or talent. Please, stop overpaying vulgar and simplistic performers and bring back what really works: talent.",7,5,11,16 July 2005
Edge of Tomorrow," Thrilling?
","Tom Cruise has had an amazing career. Lately, he has embraced action films, and we have gotten some good entertainment. 'Mission IV' was very exciting. 'Jack Reacher' was not bad, either, and how can we forget his 'War of The Worlds'? Sadly, 'Edge' leaves plenty of disappointment in his deja vu story. The whole thing is not a complete mess, but there is much to leave disenchanted.The first thing you notice is that movie budgets are escalating so out of control that all we are getting are faded cinematography. What is happening? 'Waterworld' and 'Mad Max' looked like real movies. I say leave all the artsy tendencies behind and give us something that is not straining our eyesight. CGI must be much better now, and we don't need to hide those imperfections.The second thing is the excessive amount of 'time travel'. We get it. He is sent back and must learn from his experiences. Half way through the film, we are exhausted because too much time has been invested on this gimmick. Some people have equaled this movie experience to a video game. Well, if you enjoy repetition, this is the holy grail of action movies. Otherwise, take a few bathroom breaks.There are some good elements here. Emily Hunt is surprisingly effective as an action heroine, tough, good looking, smart, and more than a match for Cruise's confused army man. In one of the film's twists we discover that she's not the world's savior, more of a support system, an inspiration, and that's kind of a pity because she definitely shines here. I have loved her before, but she's an action star here.There are some funny lines, and they keep you from falling asleep, just not enough, and those aliens must have stopped by the concession stand because they're out of control. It's hard to appreciate what they are capable of doing, and threatening is not something that comes to mind. Mostly, annoying! We're hoping they were truly defeated, and that we don't get a sequel.",4,2,9,7 July 2014
Whiplash," Superb Entertainment
","We are at the end of the year, and superlatives are handed like candy in Halloween. Sometimes the films are about serious themes and are immediately branded as classic, and actors ushered into the pantheon of the immortals, only to be forgotten in a few days. It's a rather special moment when one runs into a film that doesn't need the superlatives, not because it hasn't earned them, but because it is pure perfection, with every note playing beautifully, every nuance, every loud beat reaching us at the right time. This is the case of 'Whiplash', a hard driving, entertaining, and very satisfying piece. 'Whiplash' benefits grandly from a pair of intense performers, giving us probably what could be the best of their careers, and in the case of J.K. Simmons, it just caps many years of very good work. Miles Teller is just beginning what I certainly hope is an illustrious career. He stole the show in 'Footloose', and he's one of the brightest spots in the rather silly 'Divergent'.The film is the story of a man trying to find that new musical genius, one who believes you have to push beyond rational limits to make that diamond truly shine, even when some of the methods are a bit unconventional and borderline abusive. Then there is the student who firmly believes he can be that special one, but he might never get there because of his personal hubris, and the fact that his teacher might not give him the chance he needs.Tensions mount as teacher drives student to frustration, unbearable amounts of pain, and the point where he might doubt his true potential. In addition, we have twists of fate that are likely to derail everyone's plans, and in a terrific conclusion, a musical ride, unlike anything we have seen recently, making recent musical entries recoil in shame because they lacked both soul and talent. Here we have the beat at its most alive, matching the intensity of the performances, the beauty of the photography, and with masterful editing strokes, pushing us in the audience to witness what joy it is to see all of the pieces of a good movie team work in perfect unison.Teller shows what a physical performance can be, and he the dazzling Simmons to match and play along with. Both are leading performances and hopefully will be recognized as such. It's a perfect team, with the necessary balance to make everything work.Come and go along for the ride, and you'll truly see plenty of diamonds shine, like the most beautiful of those stars before they were told they were doing a very 'good job' and started settling for less.",10,0,2,25 November 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Loud and Flat Failure
","De Caprio is the heart of the film, a daredevil whose motivation seems to be a misguided desire to acquire as much money as possible. He lives his life as a constant dare, using and abusing the investments of others, gambling with his personal relationships and his own health. He constantly endangers his life and those who are closest to him. It seems like he is capable of stopping this fall, but he keeps sinking and sinking. We could say he has a survivor's nature, but he carries with a very intense death wish, too.Usually, it's easy to understand how people like him become so successful. There's gotta be a bit of charisma to their natures, so that we can see how they seduce the rest of the world into following them. Unfortunately, the main lead here lacks that quality, and in one of the worst casting choices in recent history, what we get is a man who is not full of life and youth. He himself become his own iceberg as he reveals his 'age' early in the film, and De Caprio hasn't looked that youthful in decades. This is not to say that De Caprio doesn't try, but he's not a good fit for this role. About three years ago, in 'The Social Network' we could see the recklessness and drive of man who could lure you into a trap. There's no way that seems believable here, especially when you see the people he surrounds himself with. His wolf can't cast a spell, and he can hardly bite.Mercifully, we are not treated to the hyper kinetic editing and camera work we usually encounter in Scorcese's films, but he's found other ways to annoy us. He intermingles 'Infomercials' throughout the movie, as if we need reinforcement about the seductive power of his character. They are sometimes ridiculous, and I doubt that is the intent. There are also liberties with the source, and it's a pity because the text is a delight to read, giving us the opportunity to wonder how something that is definitely based on reality can appear so unbelievable. The movie tries desperately to portray the excess and trappings of wealth, but there is nothing sexy about the constant parade of prostitutes and the overuse of obscenities, which occur at least every other minute. The books gives us time to breathe. Nothing like that is ever possible here, and that's why the film feels flat, not necessarily boring, but it fails to crackle because it's just too much of the same, never showing us where all the madness originates. There's little fire, just an endless portrayal of stupidity.Not all is lost (like in that other film) because we have a rising star here. Margot Robbie makes quite an entrance and gives the best and most solid performance here, enhanced by the mess the rest of the cast comes up with. She's a formidable beauty, with lots of ambition, an overpowering stare that will let you see that she is not afraid to seek ambition, but she is still a full human being, capable of distinguishing between right and wrong. She reminds you of a more powerful Sharon Stone in her earlier films, and she is as talented as she is gorgeous. Here we see how one person can become obsessed with another, but it also makes you wonder why anyone would even stray from such a beauty. Oh, yes, I forgot it's perfectly obvious drugs can totally ruin your life and turn you into a monster.The film is way too long, with more than a dozen scenes that could have been eliminated because they don't add anything to the story flow. We wish we could see more of the FBI agents, and it would be helpful to see why Wolf doesn't seem to find any way to listen to his father, a wonderful and underused Reiner.We can guess the film's ending from its early frames. It seems as if all the energy goes into the presentation of the material, and little consideration is giving to the dialogue, other than peppering the conversations with redundant expletives. Parading naked people around, having snorting line after line of that white powder, or coming up with sound blasting songs to underscore a point is a brutal point to deliver a message. Just recently the Coens gives us a more dimensional creation with no more than a few ungrateful remarks here and there. All the time I could only wonder how it was that this film escaped the stamping of that NC 17 rating because its only success was the abuse of visual imagery and irritating language that loses its impact as it appears in an endless barrage of mind numbing utterances.",1,292,556,25 December 2013
Bram Stoker's Dracula," A Love Story with a Powerful Heart and a Great Bite!
","Many have tried and few have succeeded translating this masterpiece into the great film it should be. Yes, there are hints of power, romance, and unexplained hellish forces at work in the 1931 Lugosi film. However, rarely has a master given us as memorable a film as Francis Ford Coppola was able to create with the expert team of filmmakers and actors in this movie. For starters, having Wynona Ryder play the role of the beloved Mina is one of the best pieces of casting ever thought by Hollywood. She's as smart and passionate, a force of nature who can't understand the extent of her spell over her doomed lover. Ryder is capable of showing emotions and passions in a few minutes with a gesture or a look. In the title role, Oldman is grand. He portrays the vicious demon in three incarnations, and yet, by the end of the film, we know that the forces that control him are beyond his control.There is some unsatisfactory prologue that explains what led to Dracula's downfall. It all ties to a source of despair and despondence, an act that alienates him from what society at the time considers its biggest foundation. Losing spiritual connection isolates him, forcing to become an entity that brings about horror and pain to others. The reasons he does this all lead back to his own failure to save his love and, eventually himself.Oldman is brilliant as the old vampire who schemes his way into London, and though his original intent is certainly beyond owning some pricey real estate, his ultimate goal is his reunion with his princess. Mina, is at first confused and derailed herself, as her prince slowly seduces her back into a relationship can end terribly.Beyond the passionate storyline, we find some terrific camera-work, sumptuous art direction, costume design, and luscious score. the film never strays from its portrayal of passionate love, lust, and spiritual redemption., It is a powerful yet lovely and delicate portrayal of the only force that save and doom you: Love.",10,3,5,15 June 2007
August Rush," You Will Love This One!
","There is a bright future for the main star of this movie, a young man with enormous potential as an actor, because of his ability to embody warmth and pure love. His face conveys innocence, deep feelings, connects with whoever the audience might be in rare and intense ways.Freddie Highmore is a very special child, one human being with the ability to hear the beauty and the music that connects us all of us. He just hears sounds, and the symphony created by the beings and objects that surround him. There is so much bliss on his face that we can't help but liking him. His life is far from perfect because his talents attract harassment from those who can't understand his world. In addition to that, he is a ward of the state and misses the parents he has never met.One day, he decides to find them, and we join him in his odyssey, a wondrous journey where he meets other children in the care of the Wizard, a mysterious man who might even be another link to August's own conception. As we follow, the boy on his quest, we are treated to the back story of his parents, and their own ordeals. Both are at first unaware this special young man exists, and though we can see the ending a mile away, it is still exciting to see what obstacles lie along the way to happiness.The film is tremendously enjoyable because of the terrific music that is part of the film's score, and with the spark in the eyes of the three main performers, we truly understand and believe that some people are just able to capture the joy in the musical arts, and it is the beauty of this film that somehow we are able to partake of that very amazing feeling.You will be moved to tears more than once, and that climatic scene tops almost anything done in the last few years. It is a film that hints at the criminal demise of films like these, films that embrace what is positive in humanity and in this world, films that are able to portray a variety of emotions, ranging from sweet innocence, to the very special act of love between two young people, without getting graphic, vulgar, or too creative.Go see it!",10,1,3,29 November 2007
The Reader," What Did We Learn?
","Stephen Daldry knows how to tell a story, knows how important it is to  make each of those characters relevant and indispensable, more  importantly, emotions are finely portrayed, but it is the cerebral  quality of his work that both impresses and irritates the audience.  Somehow, he let go of his control and made 'Billy Elliot' exuberant and  glorious, with each note and emotion spilling out of the screen. His  restraint might have lessened the impact of the dark nature of the  tragedy in 'The Hours'; somehow the balance continues in 'The Reader',  a powerful testament to the complexity of humans and their  interactions. In 'The Reader' learning occurs, consequences, origins,  and motivations are carefully explored and analyzed, leaving out some  of the mystery for us to decide. Choice is key here, and some choices  are carry a bigger weight than others.  The marvelous Kate Winslet, who should be honoured for the quality of  her work, with as much recognition as it is humanly possible portrays  the central character of the story, a woman whose life might have been  shaped by unfortunate events, mostly undisclosed to us, and some of her  own genetic makeup. We, as the lawyers and the students in the film,  get to evaluate the evidence and choose to make a statement to justify  hers and our own ethical standpoints. It is the intricate and deft  interpretation of Hannah that anchors the story. Although, the story  follows Michael and their relationship from his teenage years to the  devastating conclusion, the film succeeds because Winslet is able to  show every bit of the confusion, rationale, and emotion that her  character possesses. She seems cold and detached, but as we look, we  discover that there is more to her than we can see from the moments we  see her on the screen. Hannah carries secrets inside her soul, somehow  keeping herself alive, surviving, living an austere existence that  hypnotizes, seduces, and repulses those she encounters.  Michael is seduced by this mysterious woman, and his own future is  shaped by those moments they spend together. What he doesn't realize is  how big of an effect their time together will have on his life. Their  early scenes are powerful and presented with a strong sense of realism  and brevity. They're probable the best of the film and might have to be  reviewed to understand how key they are to the further growth of  Michael's life and reactions to others. Winslet does not say much, but  her manipulations provoke her desired effects.  As their paths diverge and meet, their relationship changes as one  observes the dramatic turn of events that brings them together again,  and how Michael's actions have dire consequences for both of them. It  is during this period that we think we begin to see how relative  everything: what is moral and immoral, logic and emotional, simple and  complex. Highs and lows are hit again, as we become more involved in  one of the most powerful and dramatic moments of their lives.  In the final act of the film is when Winslet and Feines do some of  their most outstanding work ever; she even surpassing her masterful  turns in 'Revolutionary Road', and 'Eternal Sunshine'. Every gesture,  every look, every enunciation add details and shed light to who they  were, are and might become. It is subtle work, haunting, and  bewitching, the work very few people are able to do.  'The Reader' reaches its amazing conclusion with a couple of scenes  that might break whatever little strength we might still have left.  'The Reader' isn't an important work, but it is a work that should be  recognized by the quality of its work, a finely tuned and produced  piece of cinema by people who recognize how magical, powerful, and  intelligent films can be.",10,123,173,5 January 2009
Jaws," Less is More
","It's an intense movie, a powerful movie, a very entertaining film, and a very good one. 'Jaws' works because it packs a strong punch, deftly directed by a young Spielberg, a man who made some interesting choices to make the film, and the end result couldn't be more satisfying.The film tells the story of a monster white shark that terrorizes a New England beach resort. The nightmare escalates as the number of victims increase, and a hunting party runs into a series of problems. This leads to more fatal results. Eventually our trio of heroes gets a chance to fight the shark, which proves to more challenging than expected.Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw are three very different men and actors; yet in this film their work is remarkable in both their individual scenes and as a group. It is their group work that stands out because they are almost in every scene in the second half of the movie. They are excellent in their quiet moments as we learn more about each character's background, and also while combining their expertise to kill the beast.Spielberg filmed almost all of the water scenes in the open ocean, making it difficult for the entire crew, but the film looks and feels real. Had technology been more sophisticated, the film would be perfect in its technical aspects, but it might be those challenges that drove Spielberg to become more creative while planning his shots, telling the story. What amazes me is how little we see the shark. I wonder what it'd be like if the movie was made now. It'd still have his mark, and his ability to direct has remained constant, always trying to give us quality in a variety of genres.Many people were scared enough to stop swimming after seeing 'Jaws'. It worked because it is direct, about a real creature, and not marred by the overuse of technology. Proof of its quality is that since it came out, there have been few stories that even came close to what 'Jaws' achieved. It's a classic.",10,2,5,3 September 2012
The Wrestler," A Wounded Hero
","This statement is almost contradictory, but it truly reflects how many will perceive the lead man in 'The Wrestler': It is a lovely film. It is lovely because it acknowledges the good in most of us, even those who look, act, or are different. The people who inhabit the world of 'The Wrestler' are faded shadows of people with incredible potential and missed opportunities. What is admirable about them is their ability to keep going, to survive, to continue fighting for hope and love in the middle of their damaged world.At the center of this dark and miserable world is Rourke's broken wrestler, a person who is hurting both inside and outside, a character fully developed who has punished himself in such a way he's now pain the consequences, and it is as hellish an existence as we have ever seen. He has gotten to the end of a life where he can't find admiration, support, love, or even a simple moment when there is not a painful reminder that is life is failure. Watching Rourke in the fight scenes Ia almost a torture because of the way each blow, each injury, each close up reveals how new and old injuries have been created.The director also takes us inside his soul and doesn't pull back as we learn, experience, and suffer his frustration at his unsuccessful attempts to reconcile with his daughter (Even Rachel Wood) in a superb performance. Most touching are his several scenes with Marissa Tomei, another hurting survivor who has learned to keep going by isolating herself emotionally from anyone who can be a potential source for more emotional disappointment. Tomei's stripper is tough, sweet, still confused, and unsure of what her perspective about dreaming again might be.The most amazing revelation is Rourke's broken man, a character who should be all accounts quit, give up, stop trying to breathe as he discovers that nothing in this world seems to work in his favor, but he keeps going, limping, gasping for oxygen, pushing a heart that threatens to destroy the possibility of a new day. He looks around, looking at the daily reminders of his pathetic life, and he forges ahead, hoping something will work out today or tomorrow.He gives an inspiring performance, and as the screen goes blank before the closing credit, takes on a soaring trip into a place where anything might be possible, and yet there is always the disturbing wake up call that kills our hopes again. It is a breathtaking and painful film to watch, but we must treasure it because it shows how strong we can be when facing darkness.",10,1,2,4 January 2009
Dark Shadows," There Goes Another Classic...
","Being a fan of the original TV series, it was exciting to hear the very talented Johnny Depp and visionary director, Tim Burton, a man known for his ability to create new worlds on the screen ('Edward Scissorhands', 'Nightmare Before Christmas'), it was only expected the Gothic source material would be just a perfect match. A look at the prospective cast members, coupled with the craze for vampire / magic in films, and this was going to be an explosive mix.Instead, the fizzle is not there, in a gorgeous film with beautiful art direction and costumes, very talented performers such as Eva Green, in a terrific turn as Angelique and Michelle Pfieffer as the Collins matriarch. Unfortunately, Depp is a bit too weird this time, overacting, and well, Bonham-Carter has proved herself so many times before, but this time, there needs to be more than just uncanny resemblance to the original actress in the series. 'Dark Shadows' just doesn't work beyond its great look.There is a hint of a outline here, based on some of the source material, but the script is poorly written, and the actors can't really deliver if they don't have much to work with. Somehow, there are mentions of dark magic, curses, broken hearts (literally), vampires, love, hatred, ambition, and check... werewolves, but it never goes beyond these all being items on a checklist.It is sad because we want it to work, and it could have worked had better hands been utilized such as a more appropriate director and a script doctor. We have recent examples of material that has been revived and adapted with amazing results: 'Star Trek', 'The Avengers', 'Planet of The Apes', etc. Hopefully, someone will take a stab at this again and do it justice for 'Dark Shadows' has remained alive in the hearts of many because it is terrific material. It's dark, involving, alluring, bewitching, and magic, but that goes with 'Once upon a time there was a terrific TV series where both juicy drama could work with a dash of camp, even when the sets were never as good...If you want to kill a couple of hours, go and see it, enjoy the visuals but leave your heart outside for Angelique said it well, when she talks about her broken heart...",8,2,5,14 May 2012
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Jackson does it again
","Yes, 'The Hobbit' is a short novel, but Jackson is not a man who makes small movies; luckily for us, he can take an idea and with the help of his wife and the best available team, he allows to see worlds that dazzle and inspire us. Yes, coming up with three films from such a short narrative is a daunting experience, but after a shaky start, he managed to expand the story into a wondrous set of films. His latest is probably as good as any of the original LOTR trilogy.In the latest entry, Smaug is disposed of pretty quickly, and this is a bit disappointing at first because he's after all one of the coolest creations in any movie. Yes this dragon is both hot and cool, and having Cumberbatch voice him is just a joy. Don't worry because what follows is more of the spectacle and drama we expect from Jackson. He has plenty of substance in here, and it is as usual dazzling and magical.The elves shine, and having Blanchett make an appearance is a stroke of genius. She's embodies the glamor and magic that is at the heart of these films. In this one, she makes quite an entrance, topping anything her character did before. Gandalf, is of course, the soul of the films, connecting most of the worlds and clarifying their ideas once in a while. He's also good at surviving and helping out those in need.Two actors stand out in this story, Armitage who becomes a more complete character, as he must overcome his sudden descent into the world of greed and power. His scenes where he is fighting madness are some of the best acting of the year, and he has great chemistry with the other actor who has managed to keep this story going, Martin Freeman. Freeman keeps improving with time, as he finds himself in the middle of the political and action nightmare, somehow getting his hands on really important objects, which will either help or destroy those who might get their hands on them.Of course, like the title indicates, the film is mostly about action, and in all the madness that leads and results from these events, there must be a solid foundation for all of these to have any meaning. There's loyalty, the fight for control, power, greed, animosities going back hundreds of years, fantasy and plenty of magic, and it is all there in glorious 3D, with the best of any production teams designing armors, props, worlds that originated in Tokien's imagination. There are all kinds of emotions with love affairs that might be doomed from the start, family dramas, friends who find themselves at odds, brotherly love, family love, all that will together result in one of the epic events of the year.I'm noticing the film is not getting much love from critics, and it's not fair because it's one of the biggest achievements of the year, where equal care has gone into working on its heart, its philosophy, and of course, everything else that one can expect in an action movie. Last but not least, its heart beats strong with the support of a superb, brand new score by Shore, and a fantastic tune, sung in the credits by Billy Boyd. Overall, one of the best and most unforgettable films of this and any year.",10,13,27,15 December 2014
Inception," The Power of Dreams and Nightmares
","First of all, it's all a big, dreamy metaphor! The best thing about dreams is that just about everything is possible in them. Nolan has put together a film where just about everything technical and aesthetic is wonderfully done; reality is shattered where every law of physics and logic is ignored, and our characters jump within realities in order to achieve what they seek, or is all just happening within a more limited space? In all honesty, the emotional weight of this movie is not as powerful as the dark forces that propelled the rivalry in the 'Dark Knight'. For instance, nothing comes close to the scene where The Joker and Batman face each other in jail, and they have to acknowledge that one can't exist without the other. One knows that is the corroded nature of both their existences, and a similar proposition is stated here, and it is up to the audience to decide whether that is true.De Caprio does some good work here, not as emotional and consistent as his 'Blood Diamond' turn or as relaxed and fun as 'Titanic'. As a matter of fact, it's a bit too close to his turn in 'Shutter Island', another movie where the look overpowers the heart. Except that Nolan is a much better director when manipulating his audience, and he does an exceptional job here by showing us the alternate realities, and the dreams within the dreams. Particularly impressive are the last 45 minutes of the movie until it reaches its climax, and this is where the debates begin. What have we been watching for the last two hours? Is it one of the ultimate possibilities of science and its manipulation of the mind, as characters invade the private world of someone's dreams? Or are we looking at a very sophisticated of a personal nightmare that might be affecting someone's perception of reality? The ending is shattering because it could either solidify the whole concept, or imitate the universal reaction we all have after we have been part of a sensational adventure, only to realize that it is just a fabrication of our minds? Nolan's film is not a perfect film. It becomes at times a bit monotonous in its emphasis to be the perfect development of a fabulous idea. Yes, it has wonderful elements, such as Zimmer's score, and some solid acting, but there are moments when it invites a yawn or two. In the end, one can't say it is disappointing; yet it is missing some of the emotional forces that inhabited some of his other films. One can't help but wonder if De Caprio had given us an equal amount of pain as the one he showed in 'Revolutionary Road' or the range he was able to show in 'Catch me if You Can'. Still, after some of the fare Hollywood has produced this year, this film stands among the best, and it deserves to earn Nolan some of the recognition he truly deserved last year.",7,1,4,17 July 2010
WALL·E," Mixing the best of humanity with a touch of the divine
","It is ironic that the portrayal of a lonely mechanical being is the best reminder of what is best in all of us, of the divine spark that makes us special, able to create, not destroy, of keeping our hopes and spirits alive. 'Wall-E' charmingly presents the idea without preaching, and its warnings are presented with no distractions, the consequences of our present lack of respect for ourselves and our world is shown in sad, broad strokes. 'Wall-E' is part of the landscape, but he stands out because his spirit is able to break through and recognize that something is amiss, and that his 'heart' beats strong waiting for the right moment to set things back in the proper order, even when that might not be his true intention. However, something has changed him the robot with the ability to feel and love. It is up to us to learn the lesson by watching his sweet odyssey.At first, Wall-E leaves in a desolate universe, a place that was once wonderful and strong. His program keeps him performing a routine that keeps him going; along the way he picks up and discovers thousands of little treasures that he saves in his 'home'. Eventually, his routine is shattered with the arrival of a stunning new presence. She literally and metaphorically storms into his world, and he is not the same anymore.Amazingly, it is the introduction of the setting that breaks our hearts, and it is the marvelous depiction of the courtship between EVE an Wall-E that restores our faith in the power of the 'human spirit' because even though the mechanical wonders created through the process CGI, there is something sublime and divine in the mix, and it comes through in the portrayal of two beings that are representations/versions of what we can and might be if we get to believe in our own potential. As I mentioned before, there is a message here, subtly presented, unspoken but powerful enough to move worlds and travel through galaxies, to hit us with its universal power. This is an important movie, and it we really pay attention to its wonderful story, we can get far.How did it get so good? It is put together with several references to the best of many of the best films that have ever come out. It combines the forces of creative talent and the inspiration or the forces that are unleashed when a great film comes. The vision of '2001' with the heart of 'E.T.' finally explodes through the eyes of a simple, everyday robot that still has faith and believes in wonder. Even through the moments when the film becomes a 'thriller', Wall-E as a character retains his innocence and never transforms itself into an empty headed display of fancy CGI work. In fact, he remains, a rather unsophisticated looking collection of mechanical pieces that has done well this far, and needs only more thing in his existence to be complete. When EVE arrives, we know she will be the perfect complement, and in the most exciting parts of the movie, EVE (wonder about the symbolism here), with her actions, allows humanity to pull through.'Wall-E' is breathtaking, funny, sad, always engaging, and a masterpiece in every sense of the word, a work of love, consistent, accessible, beautiful to look, sweet in its depiction of a situation that is of utmost importance to everyone who lives in this world. Its message is clear, and it is not anyone's personal agenda or a direct attack on anyone. It is just a call to look back at what makes us the best we can be, to our ability to pull through in the worst of times, to that special feeling that we can't understand, but that we all yearn for, the ability to love ourselves, as well as the rest of what is around us.Typically a classic earns five stars; this time I wish this film could earn more, let's make it five gold stars...",10,5,10,27 June 2008
Arrival," Science, Soul, Feelings, and Time
","We do learn from experiences: good and bad. Also, we will succeed in life if we manage to look at life from all possible angles (figuratively). The more we are exposed to, the more successful we are likely to be. However, we need to be able to still in touch with our emotions and others'. In this challenging and engaging Science fiction film, we get to see how both rationales can stand next to each other, and they're all embodied in a character beautifully played by Amy Adams, who makes quite a comeback to solid acting after a couple of less than satisfying movies.Here she is a linguist, one of, if not the best in the world. She knows her standing because she's trained herself to be the best; yet she is also able to understand how language functions, and how it has evolved, and most importantly, it can't exist without context and communication. This is what the movie is all about, and it's obvious from the beginning. Still, more than a few in the audience are going to be sidetracked by their own expectations and the very remarkable design of the film.Based on a short story, the film is expanded both visually and thematically, involving the audience with its plot, and more importantly, with the level of execution by its director and its main star. Adams takes on the role, uses her eyes, voice, and body to convey all the emotions that are clashing inside of her. She tells her team that one must try different approaches to understand what the aliens want, that one must not give up. In the meantime, we are given flashbacks of her life and some dark moments that must have shaped who she has become. Not everyone of her family scenes are sad. There's much love and happiness in there, too. They're bittersweet, and somehow, they're connected to what she's trying to decipher.Twelve mysterious spaceships, which somehow bring to mind the monolith in the 2001 movies are hovering in different part of the world, challenging each of those regions, taunting them with the possibility of something terrible on the future. Still, a few of the scientific teams break through, only to have a few of them end up tragically, and one of them set on starting what might possibly be, the end of the world.Adams proves to be the key to the resolution of the mystery, and it's a bit of a shock to realize what is really happening, and how essential she is to making sure that things turn out o.k. Unfortunately, she must deal with some interesting variables: the political agenda of some countries, the unwillingness to trust each other, and the inability to have faith and to dream.Circles are essential to the story. They come in all shapes and designs, and they are the way the alien species communicates with Adams and the other people around her. There's a bit of a competition between the scientists and the linguists, until they realize they need each other. Also, we get to see the creatures in some disturbing close ups which make us understand why humans are, to say the least, stressed because we are very limited in our beliefs and sometimes can't see beyond what is front of your face. They can't see that the aliens are willing to communicate, that they might share some similarities with the human race, and that they might need each other. In the tradition of H.G. Wells, the great Science fiction films work with both our feelings and our abilities to rationalize whenever possible.Villanueve keeps you hanging and might test a few people in the audience who are expecting for something flashy and dazzling to happen. It does, it is electrifying to know that stories can still be told without resorting to a barrage of unnecessary special effects. This film has the brain, the heart, and the intelligence to treat us with respect and to even throw some philosophies for us to ponder what it is that we are doing with our lives, and how time is really more than anything a circle, a perfect shape that is all over us in the universe and we certainly learn to take it for granted. You won't after you see 'Arrival'.",10,4,15,13 November 2016
The Blind Side," Bullock rocks!
","I have enjoyed Bullock's work for the last two decades, even since her fresh face showed up in 'Speed'. She was the perfect damsel in distress in 'The Net', and she has shown a comedic side more than once, most recently with good results in 'The Proposal'. Her latest entry is mind blowing, as she takes on a real life inspirational icon and walks away a winner.What this film gives is more than an inspirational tale and a positive message, one that one rarely hears in a crowd-pleasing movie. It's a proved formula, but one that is botched more often than one would expect. Here we have the underdog and a protégé, a story that we know will usually result in a few tears and quite a thrilling conclusion. This time out, the formula veers a bit and it works well, as the focus is not placed on our underdog but on the forces that shape him and help him succeed. There is also plenty of love thrown around, and the most interesting thing is how sincere the whole mix feels.Bullock plays a wealthy southerner who takes it upon herself to rescue a most unlikely prospect; with her tough love and support, he eventually reaches his goal, not without giving us plenty of opportunity to see that her road will be a little bumpy. What is most satisfying about Bullock's performance is how deep and complex her approach is. She conveys several emotions simultaneously as we listen to her deliver lines that are close to a bit overdone, but take on interesting tones with her looks and gestures. In one of my favourite scenes she must face a group of thugs and the steely delivery is as much as crowd pleaser as Dirty Harry's 'Make my day'.There is a lot to like in 'The Blind Side', with strong support by the secondary characters, and the way the story is kept from becoming over-sentimental. It moves well, and it does give you a refreshing twist on something we have seen before. Here it all depends on how it is executed and much of the strength lies in Bullock's inspiration both on and off the screen.",10,2,5,27 November 2009
The Shawshank Redemption," Exploring your own soul
","Rarely has a director connected so well to the spirit of a story, and with the impeccable work of Morgan Freeman, whose narration is nothing short of perfect, and Tim Robbins' everyman, 'Shawshank' delivers an almost perfect film. Frank Darabont has opened up the short story and created a work that explores what lurks in the souls of people. He has added details that allow us to understand how the human spirit manages to survive in the worst of conditions. He also shows us that beauty lies in just about any place in this world.The film moves very well, taking us for a long and rewarding ride. Characters age and evolve, discovering how their relationships with others always have consequences. Tim Robbins remains at the center, and he becomes, for most of the film, an observer, our representative in a world that could destroy you if you let it.We relate to the men of 'Shawshank' because they are our representatives in a microcosm of society. We observe as we participate and see our reflections in a mini study of emotions and mind games.",9,0,0,1 August 2005
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," One star and that's for Keaton's effort
","There's always a slot for a movie every calendar year for the one film that everyone praises but hardly anyone understands, likes, or comes close to fathom why it receives such accolades. 'Birdman' and its entire cast and crew (with the exception of Keaton) have taken that spot, dislodging 'Boyhood' out of this position. Still, 'Boyhood' had Ethan and Arquette, which made it passable.'Birdman' feels like an inside joke, and it never escapes that categorization for it constantly repeats its wink wink attitude. It keeps calling attention to how much it knows about the world of theater and its actors, so full of insecurity, mental trauma, every possible mental instability you can think of, and most importantly inmeasurable amounts of egocentric devotion. It is always, not so subtly calling attention to how hard it is to be a real actor, how much drama there is, and how special those beings are.Keaton plays an actor who wants to be taken seriously by giving Broadway a try, and it's not an easy task because for starters, he doesn't trust himself as being anything else but a long-gone matinée idol, and this is in spite of his fans who keep jumping out of nowhere. You'd think that'd keep his ego satisfied, but where would the film go if there was no drama? So the four writers behind this mess keep piling up the tragedies... an addicted daughter, a possibly cheating girlfriend, who might or not be pregnant, a loving ex-wife who can't stay away in spite of the 'attack', a manager who seems to offer too much support, a hateful critic, the local bar... I kept wondering when the Thelma Ritter character was going to make an appearance to liven things a little, but we did have an Eve Carrington type in there, somehow modified to make it look fresh and more psychotic. I never thought I would dislike anything Norton did, but this film managed to make him and Watts totally useless, and these two have been formidable, especially Watts in her last films. She's wonderful in 'St. Vincent', showing she's capable of delivering great performances, and to make us feel even worse, there's that lesbian kiss, making me yearn for her sublime turn in 'Mulholland Drive'.So much is wrong with this film that it would take pages to express the disatisfaction. The dialogue is borderline unbearable, making us wish the fictitious 'Birdman' strike them dead. These people can't stop talking about their 'problems' because if they didn't have them, their lives would be even more boring. It's just plain unbelievable that all actors carry that psychological weight. Are there any happy Broadway types? Even Watts is not happy she finally made it?Then there is the gratuitous nudity. There was something strange about that preview, and it did hint at both something special and something really wrong with the film. To be fair, had the film concentrated on the Keaton character, it would have soared. This happens way too late in the movie, and it's an incredible flight of the imagination, but the road there is just mined with too many pretentious and incompetent attempts at being 'original'. I haven't heard that many yawns and sighs in one theater as I did this time. It's just an utter mess.The subject of the theater and acting has been explored and shown with fantastic results, classic performances, and most importantly with superb examples of insight and drama. 'All About Eve' and 'All That Jazz might be the best of those films, and I can recall O'Toole, Finney, Weist, and a few other very talented actors and directors showing that type of life can indeed be full of drama, wit, insecurity and human comedy. 'Birdman' only shows everything that can go wrong with trying to pretend that you do know what is going on.Finally, don't get me going on those long hand-held shots... There was once a film about some criminals that was praised to heaven for something similar, and that certainly didn't make it a better film. In this case, it's supposed to be intimate; instead it's annoying, intrusive, disturbing and just another example that along with the interminable number of close ups, it only makes us feel extremely nauseous.",1,501,1014,10 December 2014
The Conjuring," Good Old Fashioned Horror Fest
","James Wan is a very good director, capable of carrying out an atmospheric piece, with a solid understanding of his material to put us right in the middle of the action and let us have a relatively good time.Here is a real-life story of a family haunted by evil spirits. The question is whether they will be able to survive the ordeal, and why is this case so special to a couple o the best demonologists in the United States in 1971? We do find out after a tight exposition in which little by little the family suffers through different manifestations of the evil entity. The young girls are tormented every night as the clock stops at exactly 3:07 a.m., and soon, their mother is plagued by a series of physical ailments that can be tied to nothing good. The crisis intensifies as children disappear, and the spirits of the ghosts start manifesting themselves in terrifying ways.With the help of excellent art decoration, we are surrounded by a house that looks like it has lived through some serious demonic occupation. It looks damaged, destroyed, tired, in addition to terribly scary. You know anyone with some common sense should stay from it, and we start wondering why it is that these people do not remove themselves soon enough. They get their first warning as one of their family members is attacked earlier in the film, but through a logical but quite so understandable excuse, they are forced to stay.Everyone actor in the movie is wonderful. With Lily Taylor playing a nonsensical but loving mother who sees her world shatter slowly and painfully, as each of her beautiful daughters is exposed to more psychological and physical torture. The apparition themselves help enhance the mood, as we see decay and destruction, and soon, with the help of some research, we learn the origin of all these ghosts and their reasons for causing such havoc.In the last third of the movie, the film takes on some spiritual and religious overtones, and it will all depend on how you view these themes, but you are bound to be compelled to look at the fight with good and evil, and it is quite remarkable how much new special effects can simulate realism of this type. The exorcism in the last part of the film is violent and quite intimidating. This is no quite 'The Exorcist' a perfect blend of different genres and almost letter perfect direction and craftmanship, but it reaches high and delivers some good and strong old fashioned thrills and chills.",9,1,3,22 July 2013
Prometheus," Dpn't Miss The Point. Look at the whole picture.
","Scott continues to make quality films and defy a direct association with a particular genre. He has tackled just about everything and proved himself one of the best film directors of this and the previous century. This film will be another of the jewels in his crown, a film that will most likely earn its share of detractors because they, either don't agree with the questions it raises or with the fact that it does require a bit of thinking. To be fair, it would be impossible to explore the theme subject matter in two or three hours. Most importantly, this is not just a science fiction/fantasy film. It, like most important science fiction landmarks, looks ahead and introduces ideas that will most likely be the genesis of important ideas and/or exposure to many to new concepts.Before going on, it bothers me to see how people jump to embrace films that give us a 'concept' and is never fleshed out, or a preposterous idea of something that is downright ludicrous but that is hidden behind excellent production values; yet it is clear that there no 'soul' or real substance underneath. 'Prometheus', on the other hand dares to pose the big question about our origins. It is not an original idea, but the screenwriters and Scott have revisited something that sits in the hearts of scientists and theologians who want to know the 'truth'.In the film, the prologue can baffle a few people in the audience. Who is the 'humanoid' and what happened to him and after his disappearance? Later on, as the crew finds its way into the other planet system, we are teased by the hieroglyphics which resemble writing we have seen before. Furthermore, the supposed DNA connection will rattle a few cages. This is fascinating material, and it looks like fiction now, but as science evolves and continues to explore the wonders in Nature, we must realize that the ideas are not so far-fetched. Still, the film is not a dissertation, but an entertaining exploration of themes that have been introduced before. At least, we are not dealing with a puzzling and frustrating monolith, a drug-induced trip into existential connections between the past and the present, or a trip into the dreams of a dreamer...What we have is a tragedy of sorts, which originates from humans and androids interacting with a universe that is too dangerous and complex to understand. There is the spirit of rebellion against injustice, very well developed and played by Fasbender's David. We add our spirituality and its undeniable link to science, and as if this is not enough, the realization that to humans, just about anything else outside our bodies, is really 'alien', and our bodies' immediate reaction involves prompt defense. It either vanquishes the invader and ensures our survival, or as the film depicts, it leads to our doom.'Alien' had the ultimate predator, an organism that needed a place to incubate its young ones. There were times when it resembled an insect in the early films portrayal of its society. Eventually, we began to realize that it was effectively ensuring its survival by mutating into something that resembled its host, as it shows in 'Alien 3'. This film might clear some of those early appearances, or it could confuse you even more, but the final scenes' revelation if you are paying attention will make perfect sense, considering our own history.I really liked the way Scott connected the first Alien's images with what he gives us in the final third of the movie. Now we see what the destroyed spaceship means, how we might never be able to conquer such creature, and most importantly, and this is a personal wish, we get to explore, investigate, and find out what these artists are saving for a more extended explanation of who the 'engineers' are, and what is the origin of their present attitude toward humanity.The film is exciting, gripping, and very entertaining, giving us a great blend of the best cinema can offer you in ways of production values, acting, and some thoughtful screen writing. It also benefits from a director who can make you feel the darkness inside our fears, our souls and wrap it all up in a repelling but beautiful package. Giger lives on, as we get to see, and I wonder more sets, either inspired or designed by him. There are a few surprises, a whole new number of set pieces that will be remembered as classic cinema, and even better, an important film that is not afraid to ask questions and challenges us to be a more reactive audience. We had enough of empty style, here we are like David in the film, witnessing a document that might awaken that 'fire', that 'soul' that is in us, but we have chosen to ignore as we sit placidly, encouraging more empty, beautiful, huge, silly productions. This is a beautiful film, a nice compliment to a universe that is not as impossible as we thought before.An instant classic.",10,5,14,8 June 2012
Wonder Woman," Grace, Intelligence, and Strength... What's Not to Love?
","I'm in love with Gal Gadot because she's gorgeous, has an amazing presence, captivating us with her ability to look like a bigger than life figure, retaining enough warmth and heart to get you misty eyed. After so many heroes with some sort of trauma in their backgrounds, and an overload of sensory stimulation that passes as entertaining for many in the audience, I'm glad the pyrotechnics are toned down, except for a climax that I supposed had to be there. We get some characterization that has rarely been seen, with a few exceptions, and the writer keeps things moving so well that it's hard to believe we sat through 141 minutes.The story focuses on Diana, Wonder Woman, a special creation of Zeus who is not aware of her role in the universe, but who knows she must somehow help the human race survive and get better. There's, of course, a villain that is as powerful as she is, and this one is clear about what he is supposed to do, and if you pay enough attention, I'm sure you can figure what figure he's standing for. It's an interesting inclusion in this type of movies, but then again, we're giving a nice first act that takes us back to some exciting mythological background, with a film that treats the Amazons, and women in general as full human beings, valuing both their physical traits, their spiritual core, and their intelligence. Diana might be naive about a lot of what goes in the world outside her area, but she's strong, adaptable, and willing to learn without sacrificing her faith on what she believes in.With the support of Chris Pine, she manages to learn about what humanity has done, is doing, and is capable of doing. The question is what she is willing to accomplish or whether her role needs to be redefined. It's a bit heavy at times, but it's kept simple enough to let us enjoy the story and the movie, and having such a capable actress makes the experience remarkable.There were times that I was laughing at the innocence and joy Gadot gives her character when she enjoys the simple experiences of life. She has a wonderful laugh and light that shines brightly when she sees something that is precious for many. She is also great about portraying the dark times, the disappointing and the pain of losing something that she treasures.Let's not forget the very cool emphasis on her powers, her tools, and the way the director (who happens to be lady). She's graceful while she fights, but she's no weakling. There's are shots that remind us she's of royal origins, connection to Gods, and she's still somehow a very powerful human being. She can get hurt, but she's also really good making sure she protects herself and battles her enemies.There are 'quiet' moments, and Gadot is superb in those, too. Her entrance in the gala is a stunner. Jaws will drop at the way she carries herself. We see also how beautiful and expressive her close ups are when she realizes there's something going on with army friend. She's a hero, a leader, a soldier, a lover, a friend, and a goddess both from her mythological origins to her moment in the silver screen.",10,15,35,2 June 2017
The Queen," As Good As It Gets
","Helen Mirren is a superb actress. For nearly one hour and forty five minutes she becomes Queen Elizabeth II, giving us a glimpse of what it must have been for that remarkable woman during a very stressful week of her life. Director Stephen Frears demonstrates what assured directing can produce. The film flows easily from beginning to end, carefully weaving a narrative where everyone gets a chance to present his / her view.Mirren perfectly portrays the conflicted monarch who must balance her set and conventional views with what it is needed from her during a critical time in the history of her country. Suddenly she risks becoming archaic and portrayed as a unfeeling monster, a characterization that interacting with her famous daughter in law she managed to develop in the eyes of her country.With the astute intervention of her newly elected Prime Minister, things might take a turn for the better. The end result is not surprising because it is by now public knowledge, what is fascinating is the trip there, an emotional ride with enough class to appeal to the old guard and intense dramatic components to make even the most cynical member of the audience react and get all sentimental.The film has exquisite production values, with gorgeous camera-work and a magnificent musical score that fits its theme very well. It is a pleasure to know Frears has come up with another royal winner.",10,2,4,7 October 2006
1408," Was this as bland for you as it was for me?
","There is more than one saving grace in '1408'; unfortunately, it is the tour-De-force by Mr. Cusack that literally kills everything else here. The concept is fine, the special effects are sometimes very impressive, but the whole project feels like the accompanying documentary that shows up in a few DVD's... it is not the movie, it doesn't have the dramatic core that makes the feature presentation appealing, either good, bad, superb, or awful. What is so distinctive about this film is that it feels very bland, devoid of any life, inspiration, or difference between the highs and lows.Cusack, the non believer, pretty much, along the lines of the most interesting 'The Reaping', where an intense Hillary Swank became personally involved in finding redemption and salvation for a town and others, as well as herself. In '1408', a reporter is now in the middle of a world that he doesn't really believe in. Clunkily directed and written, Cusack goes from a typical assignment to a nightmarish one, where is quickly besieged by his own demons and a few other unexplainable events, and he learns that the occurrences that he has somehow disregarded as impossible, are indeed more real than he ever thought possible.There are some 'chilling' moments in the film, as Cusack realizes that he has lost all control, and a couple of times we see the moments that would have startling in a much better movie, here look like apathetic first rehearsals. There is a moment when Cusack searches for numbing liquor, and instead he opens a window into the manipulative connection between horror and reality. In the climax, there is another upsetting scene, with the power of a bad 'Three Stooges sketch'.Maybe it's the anticipation of seeing an experiment with Cusack, who is an intelligent and capable actor. One expects much more than this amateurish result. Cusack somehow typecasts himself. He looks rather familiar, perhaps in the way he is presented. There is not much that is different from the Cusack we have seen in films, like 'High Fidelity', 'Must Love Dogs', or a few other movies. In fact, his physical appearance might be a drawback here. Had more time been invested in smoothing details and had someone taken the time to look at the director's work before the entire film was shot, we might have come up with a much better movie.There is something known as suspension of disbelief, but I doubt even that can help here. So, American audiences have already used much of that when viewing 'Spiderman 3', 'Shrek 3', and 'Pirates 3', after those three there is not much left, and '1408' is the first casualty of the summer. Hollywood, you have the resources, use them and come up with another Golden Age; well, maybe you can at least get close enough to silver...",4,2,9,22 June 2007
Fifty Shades of Grey," Romantic Hoopla
","Based on one of the best selling titles of the century, 'Fifty' introduces us to two unlikely candidates for a romantic match. He's has a disturbing set of ideas, originating in a mysterious liaison with a friend of the family. She has managed to remain pure in the modern world but surrenders to his magnetism when they meet. She's warned, but she still lets herself be trapped into his luxurious and dominant trap.There has been a lot of controversy about what one was expecting to see in the film adaptation of the novels, when the package is delivered, the results are at best handsomely produced, well cast, but somehow has a truncated spirit, whatever that might be. That is the dilemma here: it tries to be both, and it's like having oil and water. Someone is going to get burned, and it might be the audience.It's a handsome film, with depictions of a world we might never get to experience. There are sport cars, helicopter and gliders, expensive presents, clothes in a very exclusive and rarefied universe. He's all about money, power and control. On the other hand, she comes from more humble origins and has worked hard to achieve her present condition. She might be intelligent but has no idea on how to deal with relationships or judge characters.Dakota is pretty, and her Anastasia is a lovely creation. She has expressive eyes and lips. Her nature is more emotional and vulnerable, with apparently average ambitions for her potential mate. Running into Mr. Grey proves troublesome because he's, well, more demanding, seductive, interesting, and maybe more of a pain in more than one way.There is not much of a courtship. It is all presented in broad strokes. They meet, and the fire is ignited. He is aware that she might not be good for his designs; yet the implication is that he's now contending with new emotions and forces. For us to understand what impedes his embracing of this amazing love relationship, we might need to read the subsequent chapters or wait for the sequels.So, we have flashes of what made the book a bestseller, without her commentary and reflection. Here is for us to see how a screenwriter had adapted a very straightforward but problematic relationship. Yes, there are hints and demonstrations of this being a Cinderella story, of this going into the pantheon of great love stories, but it's burdened by its origins. Is he a psycho? Is she just plain dumb. You would think that with all that money, therapy would have been more effective.Then, there is the abrupt ending. They want to clear the air, fight, and soon we have an awakening, a door opens and shuts on us, leaving a very frustrated audience. We know it's not over, but I wonder how many people are going to be unsatisfied because these characters are after all, shells of some individuals who could be fascinating to know and find out more details about. We have seen a 'love' story between two very pretty people but who have no idea where this might be going because they're forcing themselves to keep their eyes shut, their minds confused, and their intelligence bound.",6,2,8,14 February 2015
The Wolverine," A Vulnerable Hero
","We had a deluge of super hero movies lately, and we are in danger of going numb because of overexposure. I keep wondering how is it that we don't get tired of reading those comic books. It might be because we invest a bit of our imagination in the development of the stories. In the movies we are the mercy of someone's interpretation, and it takes a very talented director and his/her team to engage us completely. At first, I wanted to give full credit to Hugh Jackman, an actor with plenty of charisma who makes you care for the character on the screen, and Wolverine is quite a fantastic creation that would have been a mediocre entry in the hands of less capable artists.With the help of James Mangold, the film gives us plenty of humanity, this time making Wolverine's world a little more complex. The entire movie rides on his shoulders and his adventures as a newly mortal hero. He is still pretty formidable, but now he faces more difficult circumstances, as he is not able to heal as quickly, and there are several foes who might be able to destroy him.Women are pretty strong characters here, even the repeated apparition of Wolverine's Ex. Something that a few people can find disturbing and unnecessary, but it helps us understand Wolverine's psyche. The issue is resolved by the end, and people should be satisfied with it.This film is a bit more sophisticated than the other entries, at times feeling exotic because of the locale. Marigold gives us a fast and exciting film, with some quiet segments in between exploring the new relationships that Wolverine encounters. Overall is a pretty good movie.",9,11,23,28 July 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Dark Diamond
","When Nolan and company set out to conclude their Batman trilogy, they probably had no idea it would get this far and would take on this shape, resulting on a couple of unexpected public reactions. From now on, it will always be associated with the word violence. It's not the most violent film ever, but it's so well made that it conveys the sensation, visually, through its writing, acting, and directing that it might be. The film is more complex and satisfying than its predecessor, though Bane, its central villain is pure evil, an entity that no matter how much is explained throughout the film, emanates pure, ugly violence, and for many in the audience will no have any redeeming qualities, regardless of its ending. It should be acknowledged that the successful depiction of this character's nature is Tom Hardy's excellent in its portrayal. Secondary viewings might be required to fully appreciate that much more lurks beyond his obvious nature. Watch his eyes in the final scenes of the film, and you might barely begin to understand who he might be.Bain is just one of the elements that make this film shine. There is the mysterious 'Cat' or Catwoman, as some people might know her better, and some of us might even want to change her identity to something else by the time the film ends. Women do very well in this film, and Scarlett Johanson has some serious competition when one admires how wonderful Anne Hathaway is. It's just amazing that she manages to outdo the really good work Pfieffer did in the second movie Burton did with the Batman characters. Hathaway drips with physical power, and there is plenty going on behind her motivations and her complicated, flawed persona. It is truly enjoyable to see her interact with Bruce/Batman. She is too smart not to see what's going, but this makes it more difficult to make crucial decisions as the plot grows darker and darker.Then, we have the young cop who tries to uphold justice and save the world. Lewitt has never looked so good and after 50/50 has developed into a much better actor. He's not just a cop, a detective, someone who needs a mentor. His goal is to achieve a place of greatness, maybe alongside Gordon and/or Batman. Whether he might survive the ever enveloping growing hell around him is up to the designs of Nolan and company.There is a very interesting, intelligent, and demanding screenplay at the heart of the story which is expertly directed and executed by Nolan's superb hand. He understands his characters, knows how to keep the film intelligent, respecting its sources, and making the citizens of his fictional world as real as possible. In smaller roles, great actors like Freeman, Caine, and Oldman shine. No one is neglected, and no detail is left unsupervised, details that only help make the film much better.In the end, we go to this films to enjoy a great film, with expertly balanced technology and good old-fashioned character development. Everything clicks here, and this is what happens when classics are born.",10,6,13,20 July 2012
Mother!," Is There Any Hope?
","'Mother!' takes story telling into a different territory. Is it a horror story? Or does it just have horror elements in it? Is it a big allegory? What are we watching? Truly, there are questionable choices all over the film, but not much can be said against the work done for those involved. It's not confusing. It's just different.We're supposed to believe it's a horror/love story because there is a couple and underexposed film, making the setting look a bit dark. This is a choice I am never fully capable of understanding. I'm glad we have Jennifer Lawrence, doing the best she can with her part, and Javier Bardem, though underutilized, gives a galvanizing performance. At the heart of the story, there is a connection between the environment and her character. It's not quite that easy to see how the connection evolves.A couple of two very different characters, a lovely, younger, and a bit more compliant young woman is married to a sophisticated, more mysterious older man who casts a spell on her. She's hesitant to cross him, and though he supposedly loves her, we can see that the devotion doesn't really go both ways.In the opening scenes, we see their relationship is at best tense, with her asking reserved questions, almost afraid to say the wrong thing. He looks tired bored, 'uninspired', waiting for the new idea, the new 'spark' to strike. This occurs when a couple comes in to shatter to pieces what little peace is in the house. It's a this time moment that I wonder whether the film should have called house, but then by the end, I realized 'mother!' was after all a better title.Things move slowly, as we see the dying man capture the writer's attention, and if he was barely paying attention to her, he's has now fallen under the spell of the newcomers. These multiply before we realize an invasion has come in after a tragic events, and any semblance of sanity and a sense of home is destroyed.Jennifer's character eventually gets pregnant, starting the second act of the story. Once again, things get settled, and both the child creates some type of bond between them. He's also inspired to write a new book. What happens next is where things go wild. Mobs arrive, worshiping whatever word is written in his book. Fanatics go to extremes, leading to a warlike atmosphere, which could destroy everything and everyone in the home.It's at this point where people are either say they like or hate everything that we have seen so far. There's nothing wrong with the performances, both Ed Harris and Michelle Pfieffer are dark and creepy, not a model family, in spite of having been together for a while and having two children. Everyone who wanders from the outside comes him with some type of darkness attached to them. People make passes at her, other violate their privacy, destroy or disrespect their surroundings. Truly, it all fits the whole; however there are bits that could have been executed better.'Mother!' is not a boring or particularly challenging film. It has big ideas, powerful sections, and overall it works, though it might not please all who see it.",8,7,20,16 September 2017
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Compare and Contrast
","Recently, Woody Allen has not been at his best. There have been some rather forced thrillers that started promising but rambled on, losing their impact. The spark and appreciation for the fine elements in human relationships had almost vanished. For years, we could count on him for combining drama and comedy, for giving us the feel that we were enjoying some light entertainment, with tons of self-deprecating humor, but we were really exploring the depths of human imperfections. He could make us think, rejoice, laugh at ourselves, at others, and a great time was almost guaranteed. Hilarity existed alongside reflection and guilt, and gems like 'Crimes and Misdemeanors', 'Bullets Over Broadway', and 'The Purple Rose of Cairo' forced to look at the world around us and more importantly, at each other.'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' does not reach the heights of some of those classics, but it missed by very little. Had Woody played with its length a little more, done some careful editing, and the film would have exploded in ways that very few works of art do nowadays. Maybe some of the ethereal beauty of its setting managed to lull him into relaxing a little too much. The film is gorgeously photographed and captures both the intensity and the peace of Barcelona and its surroundings. The emotions of the visitors are almost palpable, and some of the locals' own feelings come through.'Barcelona' could be seen as just a love affair that gets out of control, well, in a very special way, since there are four people at the heart of such relationship. We have two hot-blooded local artists unable to maintain a healthy commitment together because of the fire that lives in each of them. A very impressionable American who yearns for things she doesn't understand and that she might not want. In the hands of Scarlett Johansson, this character is interestingly portrayed. As is the case in Allen's work, women are very strongly written. It is a difficult role to play since we must learn to understand what motivates her, and how this is also perceived by others. It is a character that would have earned more than a critical look in other times. Allen gives her more dimension and tries to explain what lives in the soul of Cristina.Along for the ride is Vicky, the one female role that could have been eclipsed by everyone else, but it is the quiet turmoil in the heart of this woman that makes it stand out. Everyone else jumps recklessly in the middle of this love feast. It takes a bit of analytical discomfort for Vicky to eventually surrender to the old world's charms. She is attracted but scared by the offerings of this exotic universe, and it is her objectivity that allows for some balance because at the other end of the spectrum are two Spanish powerhouses, flawlessly played by Bardem and Cruz, reinforcing their newly appreciated talents.Bardem does an amazing job playing the seductive artist, a man who appears very self-assured and apparently has no time to waste on games. He puts the cards on the table and lets others join in at their own discretion. He is smooth, very likable, and quite a cad. We can't help but looking at the subtlety of his maneuvers and somehow see that it all should be problem free. However, he does have a past, and he can't sever his ties to the very unstable ex-wife.Played by Cruz, this woman is a powerhouse, somehow who can't and won't rain her spirit, This lady has no problem expressing herself, can't be accused of never being direct, and she provokes quite a reaction on anyone who happens to cross her path. As already mentioned, there is still a bond between her and Bardem, and neither lets go, aware there is probably no way their paths will ever be completely separate. In the film, it is the chemistry produced by putting Cristina, Bardem, and Cruz that fascinates the viewer. Nothing will turn out as expected, and as we are amazed by the fireworks, we also get more than a peek at what resides in each person's heart.It is quite a comeback for Allen, one that should have been bigger and more widely admired, one that might never seen the light of a director's or a revised cut, one where the parts are sometimes more powerful than the whole. Making the film in an exotic locale, with two very talented Spanish actors certainly helps Allen. It is also noticeable that he appears to be missing, yet one character can almost pass as is alter ego. It wouldn't be a Woody Allen film otherwise. 'Barcelona' is another gem on his crown as one of our best filmmakers.",10,10,23,18 August 2008
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Majestic Storytelling
","Most of the time it's the casting that makes a film and keeps us coming back for more. This is the case for 'The Golden Age', the sequel to 'Elizabeth', a film that turned Cate Blanchett into a star, introducing her considerable talents to the masses. In 'The Golden Age', Blanchett is given more screen time and the opportunity to show the range she is capable of, giving us a portrayal that is complex, rich, exquisite, and ultimately glorious.As a matter of fact, it's hard to imagine anyone else, having the power this actress is capable of showing on screen. She carries the film, and it's her ability to interact with such varied characters that gives the film its strength. It all depends on the chemistry between her and the talented actors that support her, particularly, Clive Owen's rogue pirate.'The Golden Age' depicts another critical moment in the life of the Virgin Queen, as she must find the strength in herself to gather the support and strength she needs to save England from a brutal military attack by the Spanish Armada, the most powerful navy at the time. Elizabeth must deal with family issues, ethical issues, sentimental turmoil, another self-confidence crisis, and much more intrigue and attacks from both the Spaniards and their supporters on both sides of the ocean.There are scenes in this film that will be remembered as perfect examples of what cinema can achieve, as the camera frames key characters during critical times in the story... Most impressive are all the scenes in which Cate participates, as she is able to show the amazing nature of a woman who endured much criticism and political turmoil and eventually transformed herself and her nation into one of the most powerful empires in the world.There are interesting analogies in the film, particularly as Elizabeth adopts one life over another and allows her spirit to soar, vanquishing any negative impulses and nurture the surrogate child that her country becomes. According to the film, she finds herself incapable of finding an equal mate because of special circumstances, and then she rediscovers the strength that she has always possessed and turns into the leader everyone will respect, follow, and somehow adore.'The Golden Age' is a very handsome film, with superb production, and some spectacular costumes, exquisitely worn by Ms. Blanchett. It's definitely on its way to becoming a classic, a proud example of what some might call an intimate epic.",10,58,96,1 October 2007
Saving Mr. Banks," Almost a Great Movie
","Here comes the story of the mysterious lady behind 'Mary Poppins', and it's a very interesting one. Emma Thompson brings to life the cantankerous author who has a few personal issues with transferring the rights of his precious creation to Disney and Company. She's concerned she will trivialize the material and not honor her heroine properly.Most of the film is entertaining while showing us the interaction between Travers and Disney and his associates. In fact, had the film been this way 90% of the time, we would have a classic. Instead, it swings back and forth between the negotiations, pre production of the film, and Traver's reactions to the relatively vapid California culture, and the revelations of what happened in her early years in Australia. It is clear she is not able to enjoy or consider variations from her fixed perspectives.Eventually, the mystery is resolved. Travers and Disney reach a compromise of sorts. He gets his hands on the books, makes his movie, and has a huge critical and commercial hit. Travers is able to experience some sort of cathartic moment, yet it is clear that not everything was up to her standards because there were some artistic choices she deemed not fitting.Emma's Travers is very good portraying a woman who has a difficult time adjusting, but she is able to show her slow transformation from a rigid spinster to a woman who is capable of understanding how others view her creation and don't mean to disrespect her or her sources. Clearly, she, little by little, becomes a fan of the songwriters, and once she is outside the entertainment world, she is able to connect with her driver because they can relate to some of the same material.The film is lovingly produced, and as I said before it's best when showing the production of the movie. There are problems with the childhood scenes, mostly because most of the incidents are not clearly defined, and the dialogue is at least vague. Colin Farrell does a very good job as the guilt-ridden father, and Rachael Griffith makes quite an impression as the prototype for the strict but caring nanny. The jewel in the crown is Thompson who is able to earn our sympathy as the can't help but her express her very frank views about a world she thinks is nothing more than thinly disguised parade of illusions with no much essence or heart.",8,1,6,15 December 2013
Beowulf," Hollywood slayeth another classic
","'Beowulf' has survived countless translations, adaptations, debates, interpretations, and readings, and it finally has reached the Silver Screen. Promoted with a beautiful series of posters and a couple of mystifying previews, I wondered whether it would be a successful production.Successful is a matter now of perspective and interpretation. If the film brings in the dollars, it will be clearly referred as a hit. On the other hand, purists and other more discerning individuals may have a bit of a problem with some of what's going on here.In this version, there are some points to admire, including a rather sharp technical 3-D version that highlights some of the production values. There are also a couple of amusing moments, in addition to many rather puzzling changes to the original text. In particular the aversion of the main characters to anything resembling clothes. There are moments when the audience might even wonder about the sexuality of the characters, and Hollywood managed to get a PG-13 rating for this movie.Video game addicts might find some fun in the rather loose adaptation of the classic poem, which is now devoid of soul and engaging action. There are some amusing moments when we see a very thin plot involving a mythical hero and a few rather pesky monsters, and their bewitching mother.Sadly, the action is few and far in between, with most of it happening because the audience gets to exercise their neck muscles avoid being picked or poked at with the many objects Zemeckis managed to 'place' in front of the camera to showcase the 3-D effects. There is very little memorable in the film, with so much wasted acting talent. Winstone, Wright Penn, and Hopkins are among the casualties of a program that has improved somewhat since 'The Polar Express' but still manages to show the characters as if they had way too much mead... It looks like stuff is way to powerful to ever lose that glazed look that was spooky in 'Express' and is rather distracting in this movie.'Beowulf' is not a classic or a thriller or a very entertaining film. It's another pretty package that fails to deliver what in essence is a timeless tale of the eternal conflict between good and evil. Yet, I do understand that Angelina Jolie's looks is definitely a terrible thing to waste, and was Beowulf Greek? I thought this was a Nordic legend...",3,7,16,16 November 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Top this one!!
","2007 is proving to be a remarkable year. Whereas the creative bombs have been bigger and yet made tons of money, we got films like these, giving us exactly what we demand from movies: loud, entertaining, interesting, funny, and thrilling, without an ounce of tedious dialogue or unnecessary flash. Bruce Willis knows how to pick them, and he works hard at making sure he delivers what we want.McClane is a lethal weapon again, targeting just about what he needs in order to achieve his goals. Military Planes, trained assassins, trucks, cars, automatic weapons are all just different types of hurdles that he overtakes, not without a bit of risk along the way.His detective is still pretty lively and gutsy, with a caustic sense of humour and ready to dispatch batches of sarcasm, as the situation demands. This time he must somehow from the country from an economic and cybernetic catastrophe, and though he is a little behind in technology, he manages to take advantage of a computer hacker, who might or not help him bring down the terrorists.This film shows every bit of the budget, as cars, roads, buildings, elevators, people, computers, and more are blown up and scattered all over the screen. It also contains a couple of scenes that immediately become classics, as McClane uses a helicopter for target practice and finds new ways to leave a flying plane.There is not a single boring moment in the film, and this is the biggest compliment a Hollywood movie can receive this year. It is a bit over 2 hours and is as lean as a thriller has ever been made. The only reason it doesn't get full marks is because of a bit of puzzling facts, is this all happening on the 4th of July? Why are so many people in suits all over the cities? Still, if you like loud, entertaining, and exciting films, this one is as perfect as they make them!!",9,2,5,8 August 2007
Thor: The Dark World," Loki Loki Loki
","The best things about this type of movie is their looks and the right action/tone. 'The Avengers' did an amazing job last year, finally getting us in the right groove. The first 'Thor' introduced us to an amazing looking world, and it had enough humor to keep it going, but it needed something else, a more defined villain. Then came Loki, and he is on his way to greatness.A more powerful enemy is threatening the entire universe, making the conflict personal as even family members become targets and apparently nothing is spared. The last time we saw Loki he had been captured and was now a life prisoner, but circumstances demand that Thor join forces with him, risking betrayal at any time, but the alternative is annihilation.There is more humor in this movie, and definitely more darkness, destruction, and death, and the plot twists are more interesting than in the first one. Apparently, practice does get you on your way to perfection. So be prepared to be surprised pleasantly, even though you will, as it has become custom, be yearning for a couple of years to go by so you can see what the next adventure will be like.In the meantime, let your imagination go wild as Thor must reluctantly join forces with Loki, who has a couple of surprises up his sleeve, and be ready to meet some new faces that will most likely give us some entertaining moments in years to come. Here is a hero worth of a sequel, and so is a villain who, like wine, improves with age.",Null,2,6,10 November 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force is Confused
","J.J. Abrams gave us so much, and if we had been paying attention, we would have noticed that most of the cheers emanated from our recognition of the old guard and our affection for what once was a welcome return to old fashioned fun. It looked like it was impossible, but Episode IV transitioned into 'Empire (Episode V)', and one of the best films ever (of any genre) came forth. After the disastrous trilogy that we were subjected to a few years ago, it was encouraging to see how the best elements of the original trilogy was about to make an appearance.There was very little in the previews to come up with a definite idea of what the new film was about. It appeared as if there was a crisis in that universe, one that required the return of some of the original characters to come back and power the rebellion against the new and improved new criminal order. Following a familiar mold, we are introduced to the new heroes; sometimes being a little too faithful to the introductions in 'Episode IV'. What it lacks in originality, it more than makes up with the casting of some of the new actors. Rey (Railey) is an instant star, a girl whom the camera loves because she's attractive and dynamic, and she embodies the personality of someone who has special qualities or powers. There's no overacting here. Here's someone playing a bigger than life character and looks as normal as anyone. Fin (John Boyega) is a perfect blend of bravado and comic relief. Both are characters that we want to see over and over. In supporting roles, Phasma, Poe, and Hux, are played very well by Christie, Isaac, and Gleeson. Then the miscast of the century, which stings badly because just like the baddie in the original trilogy made quite an impression in the opening scenes if 'Episode IV', and we only heard his voice (Jones), the new baddie leaves the worst possible taste in our mouth, and not because of his impending threats to the new heroes but because the acting derails what could be the development of one of the best villains ever. At this moment, I started praying that Abrams pulls a 'Stoltz' move, and we are spared from more suffering, as we grind our teeth in frustration when everyone around here shine like diamonds, and there's this huge crack which mars the impact of the drama.Otherwise, be prepared to enjoy the adventures of the familiar faces, triggering nostalgia in us and handing the baton to the new generation. It's a familiar affair, with enough mystery left to develop more stories in the next films. Who is related to who? What is the bond between the two people in these couple? How did things go so bad that the bad guys made such a comeback? How does Luke fit into this whole new universe?Finally, nothing would work if the spirit of Yoda wasn't channeled back, and in a tribute to the most mysterious and mystical crew member of the Next Generation, we are treated to one of the vocal performances of the year. Fresh from her Oscar winning role, where she used her face in an expressive way to communicate pain, she is back, confident and wise, and for such a young lady, Nyong'o positively steals her scenes, proving that she is not a one-hit wonder but a talented performer.Yes, the Falcon is back, and by the end the line up will have shifted quite a bit. Let's just hope that corrections are made, so that the new entry shines the way it should. If once Fox saved that classic, we're hoping someone can restore order and balance to the force because as it is right now, the threat is not coming from the ideas but from the poor execution by one of the central performers.",6,15,32,17 December 2015
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," An Amazing End to Harry's Adventures
","David Yates has done it. He has directed the perfect companion to a wonderful literary work. The conclusion to Harry's adventures was one of the best books in the series, and when it was turned into two films, people didn't exactly approve. The first half was a meditative study (calm before the storm), the bridge to a dark and exciting final chapter. In here, characters have fully developed, dropped their inhibitions and must face their destiny. No one hesitates anymore in this battle. Voldemort's goal is to conquer, and Harry seeks to end his threat.This film works well with technology, especially 3-D, giving it some of the depth it needs in some of the terrific battle scenes, some involving magical creatures, and others enhancing the good old fashioned swords or magic wands matches between villains and heroes. Truly, they succeed because of all the acting and writing talent involved. The drama hits all its targets, the sadness, the violence, the evil, the connections between the past, present, and future. Nothing is left to chance, and every note rings true.Harry's quest is to destroy the various objects that contain the dark master's soul, and through some creative plot devices, things don't quite come out the way we expected, but the results are satisfying, and every great hero needs a great villain, and the match is satisfying.We get everything we want from the eventual meeting of souls, the romantic revelations, the soul baring events. There is one guarantee, very few eyes will remain dry by the end of the film, and all questions regarding what and who is evil will be answered. Snape will be given his due. Overall, it's a terrific piece of filmmaking.Sometimes the hype manages to kill our expectations, but here is a case where the end is exactly what we deserved, a rich, rewarding, and magical movie: a true work of art.",10,0,2,15 July 2011
Unbroken," Enduring Hell
","There is too much praise going around for films that are trying too hard to be original, whimsical, or creative. There is a big difference between taking on a project and carrying it out to its successful completion. 'Birdman' and 'Boyhood', have in my opinion fallen short because they look good in paper but are at best boring and/or puzzling. 'Unbroken' is based on a real life story, and Ms. Jolie has put together an excellent adaptation of that biographical account.From its opening scenes, it feels right. She is capable of recreating periods in history, giving them a realistic atmosphere, a tone that remains through the entire film. It treats its subject matter with sympathy and accuracy. We meet Louis Zamperini when he is a troubled and impulsive young man. The young man playing him portrays with fire and frustration. We see how he will eventually change into the man with an iron will that will survive a stay in hell.I was hoping we'd get more of the flashback scenes because they convey the sense of loyalty and support a family gives. I kept thinking how much more I would have liked 'The Godfather II' if Coppola hadn't overdone his own flashbacks. There is true affection here but not over-sentimentality. It transitions well to the scenes where Zamperini is shown with his air force buddies. He is a strong man who believes in being loyal but has a hard core. Jolie understand this very important part of his character, and that is what makes the most difficult part of the film watchable and has us rooting for Louis's success.The movie is a bit long, but it moves well, and it engages us, as we see Louis grow into a more confident man, a man who just won't quit while trying to achieve his personal goals, and who will probably dry trying to protect his point of view and his loyalty for his country. The time he spends in Japan is like living in hell, and facing his Japanese counterpart is hypnotic and scary. Here is a man who hates with conviction, with his own share of negative baggage, and we know that something is wrong with his personality, with his beliefs. That is not a matter of politics or loyalty. His personal attacks on Zamperini feel focused, personal, originating from some internal demon that propels him forward. We are curious to find out what is happening inside his head, and we know he might eventually kill Zamperini if he is allowed to do so.Jolie has proved himself a winning director, giving us another perspective of what it was like to live through this kind of torture. It is not meant to be explained, and with the help of some excellent writers, she has taken us inside a man's soul, his exposure to horrible evils, and his inner desire to survive and never stop. Yes, it would have been interesting to learn more about what allowed him to forgive in the end, but it is still a rich experience, enough to show us what he had to endure and how he managed to surpass it.A winning film.",9,6,14,28 December 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A dazzling masterpiece
","Mr. Jackson has created the perfect ending to an amazing adaptation of the classic literary masterpieces. He has taken an unmanageable array of literary devices and narratives to present us with incredible visual passages, emotional journeys, and seamless blends of new technology and old-fashioned storytelling.Just like its two previous chapters, RTOK is of epic proportions. With the assistance of adept editors, the different story lines are integrated and keep us engaged for nearly 4 hours. We get to the rewarding payoff where all will be resolved.ROTK is a nearly perfect film, and some people might argue that its various endings might lessen the impact of its conclusion. It's hard to walk away from such magnificent storytelling with a simple ending. It's at least interesting to at least explore the many possibilities that such a tale might lead us to.",10,2,4,1 August 2005
Munich," Extremely powerful look at history
","People should learn from history, and yet we keep on repeating some vicious circles. Much praise is to be given to Spielberg's courage for exploring a moment in history that many would choose to forget. There are outstanding moments in this film, from its near perfect direction by Spielberg, a man who seems incapable of making a bad film to Eric Bana's moving portrayal of a man tortured by circumstances he has very little power to change.The film is not perfect, moving a little too slow at times and would have benefited by the removal of a few redundant scenes, but it carries a big powerful punch, one that it isn't easy to ignore. In fact, there were a few people discussing it outside the theater, and it amazed me how little they had chosen to understand.It will probably be a controversial work of art, and that is what is supposed to be as long as it makes people 'talk' instead of choosing other more destructive ways to solve problems. It is a movie that should be seen, discussed, and used as an example by people who want to make the world a better place.",9,2,4,26 December 2005
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Remember Who is the Real Enemy?
","The middle installment of 'The Hunger Games' comes with a series of challenges. How do you build upon an intelligent and well made first chapter? Making it more complex? Louder? More special effects? The key is to concentrate on what worked before and add a couple of challenges for both the main characters and the audience, and make Jennifer Lawrence more intense.The film is very satisfying as it continues the battle between our heroine and the president of the futuristic dystopia. She now has won the sympathy of the restless middle and lower classes, and they have begun questioning what is going on at the Capitol. The president knows this and doesn't want to be upstaged either as the center of attention and knowing his power base is slowly deteriorating. He makes it clear to those around him that she needs to be eliminated one way or another, but he also knows this won't be so easy with a person who is about to ignite a revolution if she 'disappears' from the public eye.In 'Catching Fire', the 75th anniversary of the games has a different spin. All of the previous winners become candidates for the new edition of the games. This promises a bigger spectacle and a more challenging situation for our heroes. The big question is how does she save herself and those she cares for since the rules only allow for one winner? It becomes a battle of the wits, followed by physical traps designed by the computer programmers behind the TV broadcast. Anything is fair game, and the contestants don't really have the advantage. Soon enough the players are facing all sorts of killing machines, living and artificial, and they keep us entertained for a good hour.Be prepared to deal with the fact that this is just one more step to the conclusion, and you probably have guess who will win this fight. What is interesting to see is how the books are interpreted, and also how Jennifer Lawrence and a very capable supporting cast deal with this exciting adventure.",9,0,18,23 November 2013
Godzilla," I love this monster!!!
","Let's be fair. It's not the best Science Fiction movie of the year. That honor still belongs to 'Captain America', but it surpasses the mess of 'Spiderman (2014)'. It's truly a valiant effort to revive the glory of that amazing beast. We don't really understand its origin. There's very little mythology but much to admire and enjoy, and the creature has literally tons of personality to boast.Let's get the bad out of the way first. Why is it that recent special effect films are so dark and hard to see. It defeats the purpose of having to pay extra for those stupid 3D glasses. If you want to charge a premium, make the best possible film, and change the setting from rainy, cloudy and dark to something that can really give us the best possible experience. Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg can do it. Why is it so difficult for the rest of the directors? Second, get yourself a story editor and check what you have before you put it on film. It's going to be expensive, and it'd better make a little sense when we see the final product. It is a horrible experience to sit through long and boring movies that gives us nothing to savor. 'Godzilla' has its share of those moments when nothing really happens, and there's so many shots of military equipment we can handle. We went to see the film to see the monsters fight each other and demolish cities. We don't want lovey-dovey stuff, and we chose not to be scientists, so take the overload of technical jargon out of the way. Hope the sequel shows that.If you are going to hire great actors, give them something to do. Four great performers here stand around, uttering borderline nonsense or just staring at each other in the most painful ways because they are supposed to be feeling frustrated (according to the storyline), and they are probably very upset because it must be hell to be doing this in front of green screens or a very thin script. Binoche's role could have been played by a no-name actress, and what in the world is Watanabe doing here, other than lending some panache to the film? Cranston could be sleepwalking here, and I would hate to say that Taylor-Johnson could win an Oscar for 'Kickass' in comparison to his role here.Now the good stuff. 'Godzilla' himself is a superb creation. Finally a monster that looks scary, and that we can cheer for since he's our savior. He actually moves realistically and makes a hell of a fighting/grunting/battle cry. I love to see him do that, and this is as much fun as watching some combination of Zumo and Wrestling, with a side of debris and atomic waste. I was so into the fight that I forgot the lizard himself could spit atomic fire. That was so cool.The 'villains' (bad monsters) are also something worth seeing. It would have been more fun if we could see more of them. We have to strain our eyes through all that smoke, rain, shadows, and a myriad of obstacles blocking the way. Why? We paid to see the animals, not millions of dollars on those other wasteful effects. I might want to see something else in the sequel, and I mean really SEE them. However, these two kick that horrid Electro character from the spidey movie.The sound was terrific. We were surrounded by the right combination of explosion, noise, screeching howls, booming electro magnetic waves and the works. The visual effects were a bit more disappointing, but I am glad that the film makers went for Honolulu and San Francisco. New York is an awesome place to trash, but we had enough of it, and L.A. could probably look better after it's destroyed.Anyway, go and root for 'Godzilla'. The audience clapped and cheered. Maybe there will be a director's cut and we'll have less talking and waiting and more of the good old lizard. A winner!!!",8,2,4,18 May 2014
Looper," Imagination is NOT dead!!!
","The premise for this movie was exciting from the previews, but it gives away almost nothing of what goes on in this very exciting and original Science Fiction piece. Gordon Lewitt, who seems to be in just about every other film this year, most of them being quite good, is back, playing a very interesting role. This one combines physical action and great acting.Lewitt is a looper, a hired killer who is set to eliminate targets as they are sent back from the future. In order to 'retire', he must retire a very special target. The film picks up when this special target escapes him, setting off a series of dangerous events. For the rest of the film, Lewitt chases Willis. Soon the tables turn, and another target pops in the radar.This target, beautifully played by Pierce Gagnon is bound to send shivers down the audience's collective spine, and this is where the film really shines. As an ensemble, Lewitt, Blunt, Gagnon, and Willis do the kind of work rarely seen in a Science Fiction film. The last third of the film is where the movie hits some amazing highs: the story has quite a few unexpected turns, there are some jaw dropping special effects, and all culminates in a very emotional ending.I'm not sure what the budget for this film is, but creativity abounds, and there is a bit of a retro touch accentuating the 'cool' feel of the piece. Gilliam would be more than pleased. This is a film that works because it doesn't pressure into liking it. It earns our awe and respect.",10,4,17,30 September 2012
Life," Destroyer of Worlds
","'Alien' is nearly 40 years old. It was such innovative and strong idea, both visually and as a concept that it has spawned a few sequels and prequels. Some came close to the originals; others were interesting ideas that weren't fully developed. 'Life' arrives, clearly inspired by the 'Alien' franchise. The best it can offer is an interesting and formidable new species, not as striking as the 'Alien' monsters, yet it is quite a unstoppable force, and it doesn't give the crew much of a chance to fight back.It becomes clear from the beginning that providing a source of nutrients and energy to the 'martian' is probably not a good idea. It soon becomes apparent that these scientists were not prepared to deal with an experiment of the kind. Many theories are discussed, and one can see a few of the members of the crew dream of instant fame. It never occurs to anyone that the new passenger might have an agenda of its own.'Calvin' grows fast, adapts easily, and develops a taste for killing anything that might be a block to its survival. Although it never says a word or tries to communicate, the message is clear: You don't have a chance because I'm deadly and quite smart. The lesson to be learned is that you'd better leave what you don't understand alone.The creature is not the most impressive when one finally gets to see it. It might be a little too beautiful to inspire terror. Its actions show otherwise, and suspense is effectively shown with the editing and lighting of the sets. It helps that Reynolds and the rest of the cast give believable performances, but something is missing. Yes, there's a threat, there is a nasty being, and the odds don't look too good for any of the humans aboard the ship. What's lacking is the sense of mystery and raw fear we had in the source of inspiration. No one knew what was going on. The goal was to survive, but dark passages and something that looks like it came straight from hell really sent shivers down everybody's spine. Through all its growth stages, one didn't want to think of anything else but survival. There were no technical or scientific explanations. One attacked, and the others ran for as long as they could.In 'Life', this life form is clearly misunderstood, even in its early stages. There are moments where logic disappeared. Other stories have shown that we fear even the smallest of beings, with viruses coming to mind. Why are the doctors so blind to taking the necessary precautions to deal with 'Calvin' when it begins to show signs of maladjustment? Everyone seems to forget that poking any unknown creature might most likely result in some aggressive reaction.The film is entertaining, but it is dark, and one never feels completely engaged by anyone in the crew. Somehow we can't relate to people who haven't really defined or understood the basic rules of life's development. Did they ever read Darwin? It's best to turn off your mind and be ready for two hours of illogical but thrilling fun.",8,2,7,26 March 2017
Cloud Atlas," Probably The Most Dazzling Film of the Year
","Six stories and many lives have common links in 'Cloud Atlas': the quest for love, freedom, or freedom to love. Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, and a very good supporting cast make this an epic ride that is bound to impress and move you over and over.It's hard to describe the experience because it is something to be enjoyed and admire as the directors take you from one era to another, slowly unfolding stories of love and friendship. References are made by different characters about what has happened before. Sometimes these references are inspirational or heartbreaking. While this is happening, we get to witness some wonderful period recreations that enhance the idea that history is an essential part of us, but it is the human relationships that make us special, and somehow life is a matter of one door closing and another opening to allow us to continue this cosmic trip.We see people breaking through the chains of slavery and violence, homophobia, ignorance, social classes, and more. Politics and some dark references about the future of humanity are put forth, and it is up to the audience to discuss them. Much of the brilliance here is the acting jobs by the various actors who must create different personas, and yet keep the common link alive. There is the issue of reincarnation, but get ready to be thrown a few curve balls, and a lot of the fun is how we might be fooled by the excellent make up jobs.More impressive is the fact that the film was directed by three people, and it has a strong unity reinforcing the various messages. 'Cloud Atlas' will definitely remind you of the power of cinema, the strength of human emotions, and having faith in the power of love",10,3,8,12 November 2012
300," Isn't It Ironic?
","Good things happen when there are good actors in the main roles. It took several weeks before I changed my mind about even considering going to see this film. The preview just didn't seem to draw me because of its look, and yet, I'm glad I saw it. Ironically, of all the 'period pieces' we've been getting lately, this is the one that works the best. Unlike 'Alexander' and 'Troy', the portrayal of the hero is flawless and quite believable. Here is a military genius, whose hubris, along with other excellent qualifications anchor the film in a more believable way than Farrell or Pitt could. Butler's king is more than a grunt or a figure head. He is a man who truly believes in his mission, is determined to take to its inevitable conclusion, regardless of whatever unsurmountable obstacle might be on the way. It doesn't help that the cast looks terrific, and everyone of the soldiers appears capable of handling the superhuman expectations the audience and Leonidas has of them. This time, even the fact that we know the adaptation is based on a graphic novel, is not a problem. Maybe it even fulfills the audience's wish when the illustrations come alive in a satisfying manner. For example, with the help of the production team, and some interesting editing and camera work, the soldiers look both real and fantastic. Their physiques, obviously, the result of some interesting collaboration, help us almost believe that we are seeing an epic battle.'300' benefits from having a very strong female supporting character. As Leonidas' queen, Lena Headley, is both royal and strong, the type that we rarely see in period pieces. She deserves her rank and is a powerful figure in her own circles, with definite and decisive say on her husband's decisions. She is supportive, sexy, and intelligent, and she manages to steal a few of her scenes. Connie Nielsen came close in 'Gladiator', but the writers didn't give her enough material to explore the possibility of her character being more than eye candy.Finally, here is a film that evokes a long gone era, a period where real men fought in an almost feral way to protect what they thought was worth defending. Losing the character of Butler at the end is not something to bemoan. He goes in a very dramatic and sensational way, and who says that he can't be brought back. He is a superhero of sorts, a man who lives for posterity through history, legend, and a touch of marvel.",9,3,7,11 March 2007
Kingsman: The Secret Service," 100% Percent Satisfying: Action Galore
","Who would have thought Colin Firth could play such a suave James Bond type? He displays enough cockiness, looks quite dapper in his custom made suite, and can probably pick up any babes he wished if we had more time in the movie. Jackson also has the time of his life, with his speech impediment villain. In addition to that, we are treated to the training phase of the future spies, and unlike 'Birdman' where there's nothing funny, this parody skewers the genre, giving us action fan plenty to cheer throughout the entire movie.We have the gadgets, the action scenes, the incredible requests to earn certification and become a member of the select few. We meet the fatherless hero who must prove himself worthy of the recognition and hone his natural talents to be able to save the world. Who wouldn't love the poisonous tip oxfords, the cool pens, key chains, and doesn't that umbrella come in pretty handy before and during a lethal encounter?In order to give the film more panache, we have to include Michael Caine, who has already graced a few 'Batman' films with his class, and Mark Strong adds a touch of cerebral ability, as he must prove his resources are after all, important to succeed in this era. What is most important here is the amount of fun we have throughout the film? Loved the intimate dinner between the two adversaries, the sexy villain who proves to be quite a challenge during the entire adventure, and it is plenty of fun to see some of those selected few get their due, as they find themselves once again worthy of salvation just because they have more money than the rest of the world. Of course, the villain plans are both hideous and hilarious as we see which groups are depicted in the movie. Most of them are one step short of getting into that type of frenzy anyway, so it wouldn't take much to trigger that type of behavior.This is a movie that is a bit over two hours, but we don't want it to end because it is so much fun. There are films out there that are overpraised because it looks like they're trying to be original as they criticize, satirize, or make a half-hearted and pretentious parody of other genres. 'Kingsman' is an example that the film makers are able to wink an eye and tell us these types of films are excessive, with just too much of nothing in order to pack it with special effects to hide its creative weaknesses, but this one also shows that you can show intelligent commentaries without dragging or calling too much attention to it. I can't remember how many times I look at my time during 'Birdman', but I had forgotten I had a watch or a cell phone while I laughed and rooted for the heroes and villains equally, and there were a few unexpected turns which gave me some faith about the simple fact that we can still hope to find some fresh material out there.We might getting too much of the Marvel universe, with a break needed soon. It is also important to note that originality and creativity and their blend with comedy and action are really difficult when they were done. A good work of art doesn't try that hard to call attention to itself. Instead, it's all there, and it flows naturally on its way to its well-deserved recognition, without the overeager critical support to tell us how great it is, when it really isn't.",10,2,10,15 February 2015
Easy A," A Star to Watch
","Year after year truly outstanding acting goes unheralded because it is not surrounded by dark, moody themes, music or photography, is included in a period piece, or somehow it's part of a costume drama. As if those elements are necessary to recognize quality and confident work, such as the one Emma Stone delivers in this cool and insightful comedy, which honors other classic such as 'Say Anything' and 'The Breakfast Club' among others. It is presented as just another high school comedy, but it has plenty of bite and is tightly written, embracing, supporting, and presenting its message clearly and without a 'quality' package, relying mostly on Emma's sweet and strong performance, as the intelligent young man who misjudges the social forces in her high school world.Many might think it is an analogy of the present world we live in, as fingers are pointed by a group of self-righteous teens who think everyone who doesn't subscribe to their agenda, and others who tend to 'help' but end up causing more trouble than it is needed. As the story develops, we see Olive engage in a series of moves that eventually turn her from a unrecognizable teen to a loose and extremely popular member of her high school, though one with a tarnished reputation.Small favors turn against her, lies pile up, and soon she must find a way to go back or surmount these obstacles. It becomes a difficult task, but eventually with the support of her quirky family, and a long time admirer, circumstances improve. Be prepared to be entertained and surprise by the sure and strong monologues, the funny exchange of lines, and the way Emma holds her audience captive, yet this doesn't prepare us for the fantastic scene in the gym where she tells the world she is not an average girl.'Easy A' works in many different level and joins other interesting and representative works of contemporary society, leaving a legacy that takes a bit to be recognized. In past years, works like 'I Love You Man' and 'The Breakfast Club' were dismissed as silly and light. This year we're surrounded by 'serious dramedies' that combine badly written and offensive serious themes with a dose of sex and death to make us think we're witnessing important material. The psych of teens is rarely presented with such clarity, and performances like Stone's should be honored.",9,0,0,11 December 2010
Click," What If?
","Sandler's brand of humour is quite accessible and yet, it can be an acquired taste. What Sandler does very well is relating to its audience and not talking down to them. In 'Trick' the protagonist represents us all of us, our wishes and frustrations, our dreams and nightmares, and that's what makes the movie so successful in meeting its goals.The screenplay is deceptively simple, carrying us through the different stages in the lives of an average family. Here is lovely wife, two charming children, and an ambitious, driven father. With the assistance of a mysterious scientist, the father is able to skip through what he thinks are the worst times of his life, and eventually he unleashes a series of events that make him realize that his life is not so bad after all.There are the usual touches of raunchy humour that one encounters in every Sandler movie, and those details keep it real. The performances are uniformly good, with Beckinsdale shining as the devoted wife, and some priceless cameos by Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner.One wasn't ready to get hit with so much in depth in this type of movie. It was refreshing surprise to see that movies like this and 'The Weather Man' last year can make one realize that as humans, we are capable of so much, and yet we keep wasting the potential to care for ourselves and others.",9,1,5,28 June 2006
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Fun, Fun, Fun, Fun, and Just More Fun
","Pixar is going to have a tough time taking the Animated Oscar away from this troupe. Without going into much detail, and this type of film shouldn't be deconstructed for much depth and hidden meanings, let's just say, our quartet and the associated penguins have finally hit the target, not once, but over and over.We have a film that didn't reveal much in his early previews and saved much fun for the final release, and it's a ball!! It seems as if everything visual gag, every joke, every nuance, every special effect just works. When I attended its screening, young and old people were laughing out loud, relating to the highs and lows of each character, and as I mentioned before, every single one of the characters has finally found a way to shine, with none of the extended and sometimes painful exposition pieces that dragged the original down. It's beautiful to see when a project of this type works because as of lately, we have been getting some pretty contrived entries that forget to let that heart beat loud.It's fun to see the penguins take on a much sympathetic approach without sacrificing some of their quite daring personalities. They are not sweet, just a bit less mean than before, and this time they manage to even top themselves in the resourceful and imaginative categories.One of the most pleasant surprises is the female antagonist, voiced by Frances McDormand, an interesting choice for this type of entertainment, but a most successful performance in every aspect. She is an instant classic from the earlier sections of the film until its closing frames.Here is a sweet, silly, charming, and very entertaining movie, something that will be hard to top, if there ever is a 4th entry to the series.",10,1,3,17 June 2012
Inside Llewyn Davis," Does anyone really get it?
","'ILL' is a film that we could admire. It certainly shows a lovely recreation of a period long gone, and it has a cool soundtrack, but we wonder if by the end of the movie, we really got what just happened. There is some type of odyssey, with enough references by a very talented pair of writers/directors giving us another artsy exploration of a flawed person's life.In here things just happen, and we're part of an audience who could be driving by a car wreck or a beautiful building, so we respond accordingly. The story's protagonist is certainly having a really difficult time that he seems to bring upon himself. His opinionated and arrogant persona certainly helps him derail whatever opportunity he might have to improve things. It certainly doesn't help that his fate appears to be written. Life appears just to be one messy circle.There's one big question here: Who is that 'gentleman in the hat'? Why is he so aggressive? Is he Llewyn's conscience? Just a figment of the extraordinary imagination the Coens are able to conjure? He is there at a critical moment, and we wonder if we just sat through 90 minutes to understand there is no hope here.Our 'hero' jumps from sofa to sofa seeking help and shelter. He appears to take this for granted and rarely appears grateful. He visits people whom he appears to have wronged and shows little remorse. Even at times when he's given a way out of his mess, he finds a way to ruin the opportunity. We don't get much of a background, but we truly know his black cloud has been around for a while.The film is hypnotic, as we follow him around time, interacting with people who in one way or another try to tell him that his dream might not happen exactly the way he wants it. There's a mention of his ex-partner, and we wonder what drove Mike to his ultimate fate. A few people manage to remind him what will his 'hubris' lead him to. Goodman's physically compromised character is a hoot. He tells us so much with his body language, and his santeria speech is a winner. Then we see the authorities at work, the power of bureaucracy and the simplicity of a poisonous remark. I want to thank the Coens for allowing F. Murray Abraham to use his facial expression and a very minimalistic dialogue to deliver one very effective strike.As I mentioned before, there is much to admire here, but it's not as good or entertaining as 'Oh Brother Where are Thou?' or even the mysterious 'The Man Who Wasn't There'. Here we are again, seduced by the critical mermaids, and are we being misled like the people who accompanied the mythical Odysseus? Is this tale another illusion or the victim of an illusion created by others?",8,1,4,23 December 2013
Gangs of New York," waste of talent
","I am bit baffled by some of the comments and reviews about this film.  It is almost as if I saw another version of the film or a completely different movie.  Every one of the actors in this film wandered around, clueless, never showing any range whatsoever, and lost in a gargantuan production with no heart, sense of logic, or a semblance of a storyline.  It is disappointing because the people involved have been wonderful in previous efforts.  Why is it so hard to admit that even geniuses like Scorcese make mistakes?  This is not within miles of his previous masterpieces. 'Gangs' is bloated, boring, baffling, beautiful in a distant, garish, and strange way. It is unbelievable that with so many people involved no one had the guts to say 'this is not working'.  Please open your eyes, be honest, and admit that sometimes films just don't work.  Don't surrender yourself to a self-induced mirage caused by the fear to be perceived as clueless.  Honestly, I was disappointed, and I just hope next time the master will get it right.",1,12,27,3 January 2003
The Cabin in the Woods," The Ultimate Treat
","One of the best compliments a horror picture can get is that the suspense worked, and it was really spooky. It has been ages since this has happened in a film like this, 'Cabin in The Woods' goes a step further than some of the classics, whether it follows a straightforward narrative or it approaches its main themes in an innovative way. This film will probably end up pleasing most of those who see it because it has a lot to offer to just about any member of the audience.It all starts in the expected way, with five college students spending some vacation time in an isolated location, doing every little thing that can get them in trouble, and most of the plot for the first half of the film follows the expected pattern, with an interesting subplot slowly developing in the background. Soon, 'Cabin' begins to show how impressive it is.What makes the film so good is that it keeps surprising you, even when you think you have figured its angles. Stereotypes soon turn into something else, minor characters begin to resonate in unexpected ways, and the jolts are genuine, as we see them in a refreshing perspective. It'd be cruel to reveal some of the developments in the last third of the film, but here is where most of the fun is.The audience is in for a treat as myths are revisited, some story lines are spun in, well, cool ways, and there is even a special appearance by a beloved figure near the end of the film. In the end, be prepared to relish a visual feast, with many a chance to enjoy a good scare, a good laugh, and to appreciate that as long as people have imagination, we will be pleasantly surprised.",10,4,17,24 April 2012
Spectre," Elegant and Dramatic Turn of Events
","It's hard to dislike any of the entries that have Daniel Craig, the man with the rugged look and damaged psyche but who is able to wear and execute the necessary outfits, tasks, and gadgets of the 007 program. It's this program that is in danger of disappearing. It feels at times as if this is the conclusion of the entire series. Where does it go? It has explored outer space, underwater, and just about every exotic land in the world, but now it has all come together, and Mr. Bond has a long list of scores to settle with some ghosts of his past (hinted at in 'Skyfall').We have a new 'M', and it's not easy getting used to the new Moneypennies and Q's, but they're capable and likable, and we will grow used to them because they have been modernized and given a bit more room than the classic roles they're based on. Moneypenny goes goes beyond flirting into breaking the rules for her 'boss'. Q is definitely more expressive and as frustrated as ever when Bond can't seem to understand the proper administration of the new toys.In this chapter, Bond is again going rogue and trying to save the world and heal his soul as he puts together the various elements of what led him to become 007. He might not like what he'll find. However, we are certain to have a ball as he demolishes entire blocks and buildings in several parts of the world. We don't have jets, but helicopters come alive and do very well here. The segment in Mexico City certainly is a lot of fun, though those crowds were a little unaware of the show in the sky.Bond proves in this chapter that he has a big heart, and that he is beginning to show his vulnerabilities. He the knight who comes to conquer and save the damsels in distress, though he's reminded by his long lost 'brother' that he does leave a trail of broken hearts and destruction wherever he goes. I enjoyed how this film is a bit on the old-fashioned side, giving us car chases, fist fights, and a bit of technology without drowning us in techno babble or going crazy with the effects. There is more time for drama, and points are made very clear as to who is who and where they come from. The relationships between the main heroes/heroines and enemies is quite fascinating, enough to send all of them into some serious therapy.Tribute is paid to a lot of what has made Bond such an icon, from the gorgeous long-hair feline, to the classic Astin Martin, to some of the gorgeous ladies who participate in the many adventures of our hero. Belucci represents the classic beauty, and we have the new generation who is able to use a gun and dress with plenty of style. We get that overgrown terrifying killer who appears unstoppable and will present Bond with one of his biggest challenges.All in all, the film is a lot of fun, a bit long, but never boring.",9,22,45,8 November 2015
Her," Scarlett gives all her soul to 'Her'
","Jonze has surprised us before with the power of his imagination, and this time he comes very close to perfection in both his writing and direction. With the support of Phoenix at his very best, Adams, shining, ironically, without any distracting make up and period outfits, and showing Mara's soft and vulnerable side, he goes very far, but it's in Johanson's vocal talents that he manages to fuse everything and find the soul of his film.The premise is unbelievable, though we live in a world where people are addicted to technology. Somehow, when the proper material is written, and the situation imagined, plus touching and insightful dialog comes forth, we are in a brand new world which makes total sense, touching our hearts, exciting our intelligence, and giving us new faith in writers' original thoughts. A lonely and insecure letter writer decides to interact with a new type of computer technology, and to his surprise, he gets way more than he originally expected, as 'Samantha' begins to show that she is more than a program. As the story moves on, both of these characters begin to change, to lower their inhibitions, and to develop quite a bit of a complex relationship.It's here that Jonze and Phoenix are the perfect match because it takes real talent to work with real talent, and through Phoenix we believe that such a relationship can actually exist. Phoenix shines here, radiating all types of emotions, as he falls for Samantha. Yet, the film and his acting would not be so strong if his partner wasn't equally wonderful, and Johansson does spectacular work, better than any of the performances than have been praised through 2013. Those other talented performers have used their bodies, faces, and voices. Johansson is using only his voice modulations, and every feeling she must convey is there. She is joyful, full of wonder, anger, frustration, disappointment, and anything Jonze is capable of coming up with. We love to listen to her interactions and 'personal' musings. She learns to grow from artificial intelligence to develop a soul and eventually transcend to another level. It's an amazing achievement.Not to take anything from Phoenix who carries the film to its ambiguous ending, as he is ready to take the ultimate step with Adams' character who appears to be dealing with similar issues. At first I was upset with some of the faded and dreamy look of the film. It had an unreal feel, and though it might not be totally necessary, it enhances the overall atmosphere of how artificial intelligence and dreams might not be that different from each other. By the end, it is another element of this fabulous film that blends delicate touches of what our civilization and human nature associates with love, pain, and relationships. Arcade Fire provides a quiet and different score, and the piano pieces are lovely and great support in their respective scenes.This is an original film, with a big heart, with an amazing soul (thanks Johansson), and most importantly, a piece that doesn't insult our intelligence by passing some tired situation or shocking set of images as anything remotely close to talent. There is no dazzling technology, camera work or flashy editing, just an incredible amount of universal love for the art of story telling and its perfect marriage to cinema. The best movie of 2013.",10,1,4,10 January 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," One of the best cinema offered in 2008
","Danny Boyle has come up with some interesting cinema, certainly defining himself as someone above average. What he achieves in 'Slumdog Millionaire' is transcend the line between inspiration and a miracle, awakening an emotional connection to the very special element great cinema can deliver. The packages might have changed, and the contents are more controversial and maybe a bit more tied to reality, certainly taking us to an exotic local, teaching us that our world extends beyond our freeway and limited perception of how more than the other half of the world's population has to deal without certainly preaching to us.The tale of two brothers' lives is told to us through episodic flashbacks tied to an episode of India's 'Who Wants to be a millionaire?'. At first, the story introduces one of the brothers as being the subject of a very strong interrogation to find out whether he is being truthful about some knowledge that might be relevant to the game. As he answers the questions, we discover that this young man's life story might be more interesting than we originally expected.There is an element of freshness in the way the story is presented, as we accompany Jamal through his life odyssey from a young child in the slums to a man who is determined to save those he loves. There are some strong emotions in the film, and Boyle's direction keeps the film dynamic and engaging.Prepare yourself to be overtaken by emotions as varied as joy, pity, happiness, anger, revulsion, surprise, and an exhilarating conclusion rarely seen in movies anymore. This film has made me grateful to be alive and that we still have people in cinema like Boyle who understands the power and beauty of the medium. He knows that the perfect mix of a great story and the respective imagery can provoke unforgettable memories in its audience.",10,526,825,9 November 2008
Mad Max: Fury Road," Action Films Will Never Be The Same
","Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are two wonderful forces of nature, bringing to life and into a hellish universe two characters who become classics from the beginning. Mel Gibson gave us the first interpretation of the role, but it took revisiting the material and finding a new actor to truly present what Max is all about. Hardy is a jaded creation who exists to survive. He has that hard look, driven, and with all of his priorities set to survival mode. He recognizes that you can't sit still here, and there is no sense in worrying if you want to live.He finds himself prisoner of a set deviants/mutants that plan on killing him for sport. Max soon finds himself in the middle of a car chase that will eclipse anything else you have seen before. At first, he observes everything around him, as he is on the hood of vehicle which is the stuff nightmares are made of. In the opening scenes, he manages to go through something that could be describe as the place where hell touched Earth, with lighting storms, sand storms, wind storms, and just about anything else that can be thrown at him. He pulls through in what many less ambitious directors would have saved fr the final frames, but in 'Fury Road', this is just the beginning, and in the hands of George Miller, a man who is around 70 years old, we get what was just a promise in the previous films.The universe is fully developed, with just about every hellish detail up on the screen, every element coming together in almost a magical way for not much is spoken to allow a skilled director to extract emotions, reactions, and powerful images from what his camera captures, a much impressive achievement when one considers the amount of spectacular moments throughout the entire film. As I said before, the opening scenes only serve as the launching pad of what will be recognized as many as unbelievable, breathtaking, and utterly satisfying.In this film, vehicles will burn, crash, tumble, fly, and spit fire continuously, and the drivers are not just ridicule caricatures like those in a recent release. There is power, disgust, hate, hunger, envy, and almost anything else you can think of emanating from everyone on the screen, even the angelic wives/prisoners are not empty shells. One can feel every emotion by letting Miller's sirens seduce and leads into total shock and admiration, not believing that what we have seen is possible. Here CGI doesn't overpower and sterilize the content. Many action films suffer from a mismanagement of resources. Here Miller works with what he knows best, but he still uses CGI to increase the power of what one sees in this movie. Very little looks fake, and nothing is sacrificing to reckless waste of money.Miller has given us a film that captures the magic of movie-making, the realization of its power. This is the masterpiece many dream of, where nothing and no one is spared. Every penny is showcased one way or another. There are no egos to satisfy, just goals to achieve, and these are accomplished. Miller should, like others before him clean his favorite space at home in order to display whatever type of recognition he seriously deserves. Much has been made of a gimmicks recently. 'Birdman' tried to blend the mania of a troubled mind with harsh reality,and it sorely failed. Here is film which entertains, never bores, and certainly is able to mix intelligence, the hells which some beings carry in their souls, and the possibility that a future like Max's might not be that distant. The film is not fantasy, it's the type of science fiction which shows the almost certain possibility of what might be coming.I never understood why some films had a certainly look, but they lacked vision, charm, or anything remotely intelligent, and the disappointment hurt. No one will walk away from 'Fury Road' because Miller respects the audience, understand that unless some is 'real' and we are able to somehow relate, the experience will be meaningless. 'Fury Road' combines the best of acting and craftsmanship. It's pure, powerful, and it delivers a visceral punch, making the best use of everyone of our senses, giving us an experience that feels fresh and visionary. Miller hasn't copied anyone, instead he has set the bar high for many, and maybe he will be that inspiration that will give many an idea of what it takes to make an almost perfect film, something with much imagination and power, something that is quite remarkable, considering how Hollywood has started cannibalizing its own classics and/or surrendering to the desire to just mass produce movies. Here is a film that proves that it's possible to dream, even if the images are those who will make you wonder if hell is here on Earth.",10,19,38,14 May 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Against All Odds
","Mel Gibson has made unforgettable films. When he brought back the Mayas during their civilization's last days, it was an incredible montage of sounds and landscapes. Here was a window into the past, fully complemented with a Mayan language soundtrack. He did a much more and controversial portrayal of the days leading to Christ's death. People complained about the violence in his films, and he's not to disappoint his audience with his new entry, a tribute to the heroism of a soldier who refused to carry a weapon, even to protect the members of his battalion but who had no qualms about risking his life to save others.Our hero is introduced as a very agreeable and ultra charming member of a community who has been exposed to the ravages of war before. His immediate family is traumatized by what the father saw while he was in the service, and because of events in his home, he chooses to dedicate his life to peace and to help others. Eventually he must confront what society expects of him, and he becomes the target of prejudice and the beliefs of others. Soon, he clears his name, only to find himself in the nightmarish world of war.Gibson puts together a sensational and more violent, realistic view of battle. There's just enough gore to upset you, but the display of explosions, shootings, and attacks shows little restraint. The tension and the horrors are all there, and one can't stop looking at nastiness and illogical nature of war.Now it's only time to wait and see the accolades that are coming to the team who put it together, and like 'Mad Max' last year, the team has shown us that magic can still happen at the movies, with a solid source, great storytelling, and direction of the best type.",10,11,21,6 November 2016
The Social Network," You'd better pay attention
","'The Social Network' is a film full of special moments, moments where we are treated to footage that will become classic, and many will be studying and discussing in the near future, learning how to find ways to pay tribute and possibly imitate the artistry of some very talented people, particularly, Mr. Fincher, a man who has already given us plenty to discuss and keeps delivering some spectacular work.'The Social Network' comes very close to being perfect, almost flawless, and with the exception of two key scenes where, ironically, the stylized language and an arguable casting choice become blemishes on an otherwise beautiful and stirring film. Earlier on, 'The Ghost Writer' combined all the elements and deliver a film that showed the maturity and growth of one of the masters of cinema, and to be fair to Fincher, this is a vast improvement over 'Benjamin Button' a film that appeared a bit detached at times, and that might have been much too gorgeous for its own good, forgetting to add the right amount of emotion in a film that need to be, if anything an explosion of passion and the celebration of love and life. There were plenty of sparks, but the climax failed to come. This is not the case here.'The Social Network' has moments of devastating emotional power. It moves us because it gives exactly an opportunity to see how success happens, how the various elements must be in place, and how talent, passion, and the desire to eliminate the competition takes you all the way to the top. The main character lashes out at one attorney and makes it clear to him and us that it all depends on focused and driven you must be 'on what is really worth it', and this makes all the difference.'The Social Network' shows the best and worst of humanity, an expose of what supposedly happened when one of the biggest Internet enterprises was designed and set up. It is admirable to see how the different players are given an opportunity to present their perspectives. It's scary and heartbreaking at times, and there are moments when we shudder at the realization of what we can be capable of doing, of how far we are willing to push the boundaries to get what we want.'The Social Network' has several spectacular performances, a joy to behold and admire given the young age of most of its cast. Their work is impressive because they are relative newcomers, and yet they seem to understand their characters and the material that inspired the film. In particular, Garfield's acting is nothing short of wondrous and perfect, not surprising since he had an spectacular turn early in his career in 'Boy A', a film that shook your soul, mostly because of the way Garfield realized his character. In 'The Social Network' it is reactive performance that highlights the essence of the tragic relationship, as he finally understands what he is dealing with. It is a classic moment of such powerful repressed surprise and fury, we can only gasp.'The Social Network' is not to be missed because much like 'The Ghost Writer' earlier on, gives a rich and satisfying experience, not a bag of tricks where fx tend to overshadow brilliant ideas. Fincher explores once again the darkness of the soul, and this time his work is not as graphic and violent as he showed in 'Seven' and 'The Fight Club', true masterpieces on their own right, but it's the fresh and innocent look in the face of academia and what might be hiding there that shocks us because the film is not truly about business enterprises but about how one eventually has to make a choice between what is right and wrong, and I think, if only we paid attention...",9,1,2,6 October 2010
The Great Gatsby," Sad Adaptation of a Wonderful Book
","First of all, the good things: The period scenery looked wonderful.Here is a movie that should have been handled by someone who loves the period, understands the subtlety of this type of literature, and most importantly, might have some familiarity with the period. When Woody Allen explores the period or thereabouts, we know for sure there is a sense of nostalgia. He knows how to recreate the period and respects its particulars, from its very distinctive look to its very specific music.This adaptation suffers greatly from its anachronisms. For God's sake, what is a hip hop piece doing in the middle of this very boring love story. There were times when I was praying that the new ice age started so an iceberg would go by and put us out of our misery. Everyone with the exception of the actress who plays Jordan Baker and Joel Edgerton appear dazed from the ultra kinetic camera moves and some really blurry 3D. Maybe the audiences who saw it in plain 2D avoided the dizzy spells our group endured.A doomed love affair, plenty of yearning, grief over lost time, misunderstandings, obvious division of social classes, and so much wonderful material is recklessly ignored so we can be dazzled by some sloppy CGI. My mind kept wondering where was Peter Jackson and the team that put together 'King Kong' where we needed it, and in popped the hope Ang Lee could add some of his classy direction and find the hope and pain Leonardo and Carey failed to find in their characters. Yes, they look sensational in their well-crafted outfits, with their dazzling jewels and expensive surroundings. Yes, their souls are nowhere to be seen or much importantly felt.They knew each other, only to find themselves trapped by her failure to pull through, and as it is expected, there is too big of a chasm between them to make this succeed. We expect tragedy, and it hits with a bang, literally, with the expected debris flying all over the 3D screen.There is no memorable line, no tribute to the literary masterpiece this came from, only half-hearted deliveries and a tepid narration that contributes little to a classic story that is now certainly doomed. Nevertheless, it looks good for a while.",Null,7,14,11 May 2013
Hustle & Flow," Intense study of human emotions
","The premise behind the film is simple. An unsatisfied man is unhappy with its present life, and he must make the necessary changes to achieve satisfaction. It's simple, but the portrayal is complex, and the performances are vibrant and superb. The film moves along a bit slowly at first, but once the set ups are taken care of, its energy and possession are relentless. Howard does a sensational job with his character, and he charms you as he repels in the beginning scenes. The rest of the cast is equally good.The idea of presenting how music originates is not original. What makes this film work is its sincerity and grittiness. It's a film to be treasured and admire, one that will have you cheering for its characters and might ask to take a look at your own life to see if anything needs to be done, now...",9,0,1,13 August 2005
Sully," Demonstrating Integrity
","Clint Eastwood is still going strong in his 80's, and Tom Hanks has high standards for performing. Having those two legends together is always a treat, and Hanks' portrayal of the modern hero is among his best work. Everyone knows about the captain who saved the lives of his crew and the entire passenger load. He achieved the impossible by landing a plane in the middle of winter on water that could have easily resulted in drowning or freezing to death. He became and hero, and most mortals were grateful he had saved many from certain death. There was still an element out there who wasn't looking for the positive and tried really hard to discredit Sully.The film is designed in a very interesting way, showing snippets of the day when the landing took place. There are also alternate scenarios; some created by the anxiety in Sully's mind after the event took place. Then, we have simulations ordered by the investigative body to show that Sully's choice might have not been the wisest. It didn't seem to matter that he was successful. It feels vindictive and irrational, and the movement almost succeeds in dragging our hero into a big mess.Hanks' Sully is a quiet and a bit of a surly character. One doesn't seem to see much of an extrovert there. He does his job, the best he can, and he displays plenty of heart and integrity, a quality that comes in full display when he faces the investigative panel. He's sure to remind them that there is more to the aviation industry than relying on machines. He reminds us of the stars of the past, and if you think it's impossible to show another Hanks' character who shows what it means to show the best of humanity.The film is short but packs plenty of emotions. We see the torture and self-doubt, the aftermath and the trauma that Sully undergoes. The slow revelation of who his character really is. We see his exchanges with his family, with his colleagues, and with his opponents. We see subtle changes, but all of them are just facets of a complete person.The technical moments of the film are perfect reproductions of the event. We see the moments before, during, and the crucial rescue moments after the landing. We become completely aware of the pain, the fear, and the horror that the impending threat of death feels like. It's Eastwood's at his best, showing a drama, a thriller, and a character study, all in one.",10,8,12,18 September 2016
Cinderella Man," film-making by the numbers
","There's currently quite a bit of apprehension in Hollywood regarding box office numbers, and the production of films like these doesn't reassure the marketing teams out there. When the preview first showed up a few months ago, I was underwhelmed by the fact that I could almost see the strings being pulled, the music cued in, and the fingers pointing to what we were supposed to react. I was hoping that those warning signals would be dispelled by the actual film. Let's just say that a train wreck wouldn't be an appropriate comparison to 'Cinderella Man'... at least there would be something real and moving in the disaster.There are problems when: 1) The art direction overwhelms the story. 2) The leading actress has only expression throughout the film. 3) There are several shots of children while the big event is going on. 4) The camera spends more time away from the actual action in the ring. 5) One starts rooting for the 'evil' contender. 6) Tributes to other films start popping all over the big dramatic scenes. For a while I thought I saw a shot of Robert DeNiro in color doing his 'Raging Bull' close-up in a couple of the fights. 7) The pacing drags only to be broken by corny jokes... 'turtles' anyone? 8) There is no suspense. 9) Transitions are at best muddled. 10) The film feels longer than the three extended versions of the LOTR put together.Too bad... I expected better.",1,18,44,5 June 2005
Alien: Covenant," There's a dark voice in hell
","I'm still waiting for Ridley Scott to match the sheer perfection of the original 'Alien' for it's such a work of art that David would truly appreciate how the game of cat and mouse puts that original crew to hell, and we feel every bit of anxiety and horror as the film progresses to its climax. It's indeed a thing of beauty.There's much beauty in 'Covenant', but it highlights the horrors of the human mind and the power of creation, which wouldn't exist without destruction and some mayhem. To begin, the movie begins a decade after the end of 'Prometheus' and things start falling apart in many ways, only to get even worse when the new crew arrives in the new planet. It's during this segment that it becomes clear that these group of people have an incredible and lethal enemy to face.David eventually makes an appearance, and we quickly learn what happened in this 'relatively quiet' world when he and the doctor arrived. The seed that was planted in 'Prometheus' has blossomed into a horrific being, a twisted version of Genesis if we mixed this with a quick descent into Hades, and a mutant emerges with even a darker vision of the future. It's something that makes the original 'xenomorphs' look like bunny rabbits.Things continue to decompose into something worse. There is a combination of quiet philosophical moments that make you cringe as you hear discussions that make you wonder what the original engineers' plans were, what made David take such drastic actions, and how his 'brother' will interact with him, and who will cross the line first and why.Fassbender knew he had the role of a lifetime when he decided to play the two parts (Walter/David). He is such a master of precise diction and able to evoke feelings and emotions with a simple look. Words are most of the time unnecessary as we see his mind planning the next move. Unfortunately for the rest of the cast, the spotlight never leaves him, and even the new and improved monsters do quite a bit of impressive damage, we continue to hold our breaths, waiting for David and Walter's next moves.The film is gorgeous and gives us at times a treat when we feel the claustrophobia and fear which were staples in the original. There is plenty of contrast between what see as beauty, and what others consider a manifestation of their own conception of what is beautiful. Scott is in control here, and the film will require people to be a little cerebral regarding the science / philosophy behind the creation of the monsters. If we have seen a manifestation of complete evil, 'Covenant' will give you a taste of what it might be.The ending is truly diabolical, setting the stage for whatever is brewing in the minds of the screenwriters. Let it be said that a film is as good as its main villain, and we certainly both yearn and fear to see what is heading our way.",10,47,92,18 May 2017
The Wizard of Oz," A Strange and Wonderful Musical Journey - A New Appreciation
","Dorothy has never gone away. In a new reincarnation, the glorious 1939 musical is back, remastered to be presented in 2013 3D IMAX technology, and what could have been another gimmick turns out to be quite an enhancement. It doesn't distract from the original masterpiece because every single element remains strong, as a reminder of what it made 'The Wizard' such a landmark in the cinema world, especially outstanding because 1939 was probably one of the best years in cinema.There are so many elements to like in this film, from its very simple and touching story of a quest back home. In the story a simple Kansas girl travels to the land of her dreams, only to realize home is where the heart is. During her trip, she is joined by the most amazing friends she could have. She is accompanied by a smart friend, a sensitive friend, and a friend who needs a little more confidence. In other words, with her innocence and them, we have the perfect person.The marvelous score includes 'If I had only a brain, a heart... We're going to see the wizard... Follow the yellow brick road... If was king of the Forest', never faltering, hitting the wrong notes. It is a great collection of tunes that easy to love, hum, and most importantly support and advance the story. Of course, 'Over The Rainbow' leads the way into the wonderful world of Oz, and the rest of the score must keep up with the high standard of the classic.Who will ever fail to appreciate the flawless performances by Garland and her supporting team: Bolger, Hamilton... Everyone is wonderful. There are the amazing special effects, which even in the grandeur of the IMAX screen are still quite remarkable for the period. This movie is by all means, a treasure, a classic, something to be loved for the ages.",10,5,7,17 August 2005
The Martian," Scott and Damon Give Mars Back Its Good Name
","Ridley Scott has given us some of the best films ever, tackling every genre from romance to Science Fiction. We will never be able to see Science Fiction the same way after 'Alien', which blends horror, science, and drama so well that people are still studying the film. Hearts stopped as both technology and outer space biology gave us the best monsters of the 70's. He went on to improve on '2001' by taking the mind of artificial intelligence and have them play God. Here, he goes back to the resilience of humans, and with a bit of humour, plenty of heart, and a very intelligent marriage of old fashioned story telling and much respect for the promising future of space travel, he gives us a new cinematic gem.'The Martian' creates a universe where a human learns to use his resources to overcome adversity and very unlucky night when he's left behind by his crew. He must find ways to survive, to let the rest of the universe, especially Earth, know that he's alive, but that also means that they must find a way to get him back and save face while dealing with politics, the limits of contemporary space science, and the ability to make a film that refrains from relying too much on special effects, but which has its feet strongly planted on common sense and realism.Damon is wonderful as the man who keeps up his spirits and uses every bit of knowledge to keep going. His acting hasn't been this good since he gave us the dark leech in 'Ripley'. Here he has a heart, a brain, and plenty of courage as he faces every possible obstacle that he faces. Unlike other films out there where knives have suddenly become less lethal than before, this man is threatened by equipment that pierces his suit and his abdomen, which makes him cringe and shudder with pain and whose body shrivels as he is running out of food. There's a terrific scene where his eyes sink in despair as he is confronted with the loss of his garden, something that signifies his imminent death. He's no superman, just a regular human being who fights to keep both his body and spirit alive.Almost as good as Damon are the rest of the supporting cast, which work each role to find options to bring him back to Earth. 'Gravity' gave us plenty of thrills and emotions. Things are subdued most of the time here, but the climax is proof that people like Scott are able to use the best of what is available to them and give us quality film making. We are soon joining the rest of the human community, cheering, holding our breath, wringing our hands as we await for his success. 'Argo' gave us a taste of what a good old fashioned crowd pleaser can do. 'The Martian' takes it even higher because we get to bond and identify with this 'Martian' who happens to be the best scientist on that planet.Funny, exciting, rewarding, intelligent, and perfectly directed, just the way movies used to be, should be, and hopefully will be in the future.Thanks Mr. Scott.",10,7,15,17 October 2015
The Fighter," Knockout Performances
","There has been a trend this year to show the darker side of nature in movies, both on TV and on the movie screens, and 'The Fighter' continues to expose those festering qualities that prevent us from bonding with each other and might end up having some very toxic results. However, 'The Fighter' shows an interesting point of view, as it balances the negative with some redemptive moments; some of which shine because of a very outstanding group of actors.For starters, Melissa Leo and Amy Adams surpass any work they have previously done as the obsessive and supportive female leads in the story. Leo, as the mother who is blind to her own powerful interventions and interferences, almost leading to the destruction of her own children. Adams, is a tower of strength, with a caustic underside. She is a vulnerable woman who has grown tougher because of her own life experiences, and she finally finds someone who understands and needs her. Still, she must now face a group of siblings who might prove to be more than she wants to handle.In 'The Town' we saw how the environment shapes the nature of human beings, and finding success is pretty elusive. In most cases, the results are the reverse and tragic. Mark Whalberg's Mickey has reached that crucial moment in his life, when he must choose to detach himself from a stiffling family environment and pursue his dream, with the proper support. It is time to go for his life's dream, and though it might be a little too late and very difficult because of Dicky's (Bale) constant self-destructive moves and their aftermath, Mickey might never see his dreams come true.Bale, who has done superlative work in more than a dozen films, from his superb debut in 'Empire of The Sun', completely outshines everyone else in the film, and regardless of the barrage of publicity out there, his is a leading man's turn, dark, subversive, suicidal, pathetic, emotional, and an effective and affective portrayal of a man who is about to hit bottom, someone who is now apparently unaware of how much pain his actions can cause. As the older brother who is now addicted to drugs, he can't see the way he is dragging everyone else into his own hell, especially Mickey, a resilient but sweet character who can't break away from this situation.Eventually, fortunes change, and we see how it is possible to produce change. 'The Fighter' never really explodes or overwhelms. In 'The Wrestler' pain was intense both visually and emotionally, almost reaching torture levels for its protagonist and the audience. Here, there is a restrained sense of despair and even exhilaration is portrayed in an almost muted way. We want to ride the emotional waves of the main character, and this hardly happens. Unlike 'Milk' where there was a documentary feel that make the events appear almost real, there is something amiss here; yet even that sense of detachment can't keep us from admiring the magnificent work done by Leo, Whalberg, Adams, and most impressively Bale, an actor who understands and undergoes the transformations required by the roles he chooses. It is impossible to imagine a darker Batman, a more demented yuppie, or a more traumatized child. In this movie, his physical and emotional transformation will bewitch you and add you to a list of admirers who have followed an artist who keeps delivering knockout performances, a true champion.",8,9,11,20 December 2010
Up in the Air," Let a little light in
","There is a dangerous to adaptations, especially when some of the substance is left behind; then there's the issue of casting choices... 'Up in The Air' has been receiving plenty of critical attention for what it has to offer. As a member of the paying audience, I have to go in with raised expectations and run into the dangerous situation of being disappointed by overzealous professional reviews. In the case of 'Up in The Air', I fell into the 'wish I had seen the same movie... category.' For starters, there seems to be a perception that if a movie is neither a comedy or a straight drama, it is special. Take away some of the lighting or underexpose the film, and now we have a serious movie. Throw in some clever dialog, and you are hitting high marks. Well, unfortunately, a good movie should connect with us in the audience, as it delivers its message and connects to our universal truths. It's hard for me to sympathize with any of the characters of the film, except for those at the end of the firing squad, and they become a bit monotonous half way through the film.Clooney plays the jaded business type, who for most of the film gets by with its suave demeanor. Other than his business suit, I found him hard to believe, especially as the type who wants to prove others that he might have the answers. There are moments of brilliance in his performance, in the last 10 minutes, as revelations become clear to him, but I couldn't see any other person but the star, most of the time. Unlike Harrison Ford, who doesn't resort to make up or major costume changes to create new characters, Clooney appears one dimensional most of the time. Then there is the Alex character, played with wonderful depth and richness by the amazing Vera Farmiga. She is the total opposite of Clooney, rich, sensual, mysterious, powerful, and very determined, played with such perfection that the twist at the end is solid, not ever feeling like a cheat.The film tries hard to reach the heights of 'Juno', a much clever and better written, directed, and developed presentation of the complex nature of people's behavior. The film is a series of events loosely connected by a trio of characters, never really explaining what makes them tick, and it tries to convince us that we know something by them uttering a few key lines in the big scenes, to 'reveal' their motivations.In the end, this is a small film that might have been better shown in more detailed complexity, as s TV series, with more developed, better presented situations to give us a clearer picture of where these people have been, where they're going, and what their most likely outcome will be. Somehow, the only thing clear is that the package must be sold, and Clooney makes for some great, first impression, but the box is unfortunately, half empty, and most of the stuff that is missing is the stuff that really matters.",Null,3,6,28 December 2009
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Hitting New Lows in Cinema
","Hollywood has produced amazing comedies over the last 80 years, with glorious results such as the crisp, gender confusion lines in 'Some Like it Hot', the hilarious horror spoof given to us by Mel Brook in 'Young Frankestein', and we have been treated to a few comedic gems by the new renaissance in animation. There are talented comedians in Hollywood, and it's always fun to see them at their best. Robin Williams and Steve Martin come to mind.Sadly, whatever is being advertised as funny and comedic in this piece of junk, is not even remotely close to the films mentioned before. For starters, it has another lead performance by a man who has taken the magic out of 'Bewitched', provided the low point in an otherwise great film 'The Wedding Crashers', and has routinely confounded us in the audience with a little bit of discrimination and taste.This waste of 90 minutes encourages us to walk out and recoil in disgust as several of the 'characters' express idiotic ideas in sounds that can only be describe as offensive, screechy, and remotely human. An expletive has been known to be funny in the right situation, and sometimes a hint of bawdy humor goes a long way. In this film, we are constantly clobbered with vulgarity, raunchiness, and loud, rude, and moronic dialog.2006 continues to be peppered with titles that will rank among the worst ever in Cinema, and this if anything will be more than competition for the title of the worst of the worst, if a certain mystical water creature doesn't snatch that dubious honor. Let this be a reminder to the producers and 'creative' minds in Hollywood: you shall fail if you continue to treat us this way; sincerely, we are not all looking forward, living, or seeking role models among the lowest common denominators of humanity.",1,13,45,4 August 2006
The Godfather," Quite a film
","Everyone raves about 'The Godfather' and its achievements. I say it's all a matter of opinion. The performances are probably what makes this film a work of art. It'd be nearly impossible to find another film where Diane Keaton, Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, and the rest of the cast do work of such quality. Even in the sequel, they begin to slack off (with the exception of Keaton and Pacino). What this movie also benefits from is the power of the story, but there are moments where the overall mood becomes oppressive and a bit too slow.The film is a joy to behold, with an evocative score, sensational photography, and many other great elements. Would I put it up there at the top of the heap? There are other films that are more consistent, whose elements work well as a solid unit and deliver more satisfactory results.",1,15,63,1 August 2005
