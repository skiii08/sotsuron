Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good entertainment, great effects and a good set up for the series
","I really enjoyed this movie.  I am a huge Star Wars fan and was worried that my expectations were too high, especially since there have been many bad reviews.  I decided to go with an open mind.Sure, some of the acting was a bit stale and Jar Jar Binks gets tired fast. It wasn't jam packed with action either like some perhaps expected but that's OK because the story, as a foundation, didn't lend itself to tons of action.  On the other hand the action they did have was absolutely fantastic!Star Wars and Empire are still my favorite but this beat out Jedi easily. I thought it was a great set-up for the rest of the series.  Go with an open mind and enjoy it.",8,0,0,22 May 1999
The Mummy," Lots of fun to watch
","I must say I enjoyed this movie quite a bit.  Acting was ok, story predictable but the effects and sequences were great.  It was very Raiders of the Lost Ark having similar scenes and similar humour stylings.  Not a masterpiece but lots of fun to watch.",8,0,0,19 May 1999
The Beach," Quite entertaining
","I thought this was a pretty good movie.  I'd heard that it had been panned by critics but I was entertained.  The story was interesting and I thought Leo did a good job acting, as did the rest of the cast for the most part. It was very different from what I expected, I guess I really wasn't expecting anything.  Certainly not a nicey. nicey film, quite violent, and the story dragged a little at times but worth a go for sure.",7,1,1,16 February 2000
Enemy at the Gates," Almost great, but not quite
","This movie was really close to great.  It's hard to say exactly where it missed.  The love story part was a tad too cheesy I think.  The war scenes were fantastic, very well done.  I was horrified when I was supposed to be. The truth of battle being a terrifying, confusing and dirty business was well done.  The acting was also quite good. Ed Harris in particular is very good as you might expect.  I guess it must be something in the pacing as I looked at my watch twice, both times during the romantic bits.  Don't get me wrong, I'm actually a sucker for romance but there was just something not quite right. My wife complained that Russians shouldn't sound British and maybe they shouldn't but at least nobody was trying (badly) to sound Russian which would bother me more.All in all I could recommend this for the fighting/sniper scenes.  It's decent but it's not great.    7/10",7,0,1,9 April 2001
The Sixth Sense," A really good movie
","Wow, I finally saw this movie on video last night and it was great.  The story-line was fantastic and the acting was also top notch.  It had good suspense and just the right amount of creepiness.  It had me right until the end.  It's definitely the kind of movie you talk about after.",10,0,0,3 April 2000
