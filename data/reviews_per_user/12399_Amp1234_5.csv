Iron Man 3," What a let down
","Let me start by saying that I enjoyed the first film. I thought the 2nd film was alright, nothing to rave about. I've seen movies that I dislike, don't agree with, or just didn't enjoy. Rarely do I hate a movie. I hated the third film. Absolutely hated it. My work bought us tickets to see it as a team-building event, and they got tickets for the 3D version. What a waste. The action sequences are incredibly mashed and blurred in 3D. I had no clue what was going on during fight scenes. If I had my way I'd never see another film in gimmicky 3D again. I was beginning to enjoy his bond with the kid, and then the 2nd half of the movie came in. Holy crap. It's as if the writers just said 'screw It'. The plot twist with the mandarin was aggravating. I don't think I've ever been so let down by a comic book villain before (and I've seen batman & robin). All the critics that came out and said that Ben Kingsley was one of the best villains ever were either bought out or just unfunny jerks. The political elements in the film are pointless. At one point they have the president captured and they mentioned they're going to drown him in oil Why? The main guys beef is with Tony Stark. The PTSD tie in is in poor taste. 'Hey we can cure your PTSD but you have to REALLY want it'. Cruel, and shameful to be used as a plot point.Now for the whammy at the end they removed Tony's shrapnel in his heart like he's getting his tonsils taken out. The WHOLE premise of the first two movies is that he needs the power source to live and it was too risky to remove.If they make another Iron Man, I might just wait for the Blu Ray. This one ticked me off.",3,3,7,6 May 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," I thought it was a good sequel
","I had no expectations for this film and I think that's why I liked it. Unfortunately a jerk movie critic spoiled some of the plot twists, without warning. Even so, it was a good film. The CGI was spot on, and this film had a lot more action than the first Abrams rendition. A lot of people complained that it was loud, dumb and unoriginal. That's not the case at all. I personally have never seen any star trek prior to these reboots. Any content in the film is new to me. I'm aware of all the characters, like Kirk, and Spock, as it'd be hard not to know of them. But it was established in the first film that this was an alternate universe. They were changing the flow of events for every character. Even if Abrams pulled ideas from previous episodes or movies, it's not the same.It's also a double edged sword. If Abrams ignored any of the previous movies, or episodes, fan-boys would be upset that he veered too far off from the originals. Now they complain that they're too close to the originals. Ugh.It was a good sequel, which is a rarity nowadays. The only reason I'm giving it a 7 is because it was good, but it didn't blow me away. Would I buy it? Yes. Would I see it again? Yes. Did it change movie history? No.I'm now looking forward to see what Abrams can do with Star Wars.",7,1,6,20 May 2013
Pirate Radio," Atrocious
","I saw this movie when it first came out, while on a date. I'm not going to give away any plot points because that would first require a plot. Here, I'll save everyone's money and time. A while back ago, there was a ship that played music that was considered illegal. Boom. There you go. You're welcome. That's all you need. You just saw the movie. It runs about 2 hours long, and it feels like 5 hours. My date and I both wanted to walk out, but having paid the outrageous price of movie tickets nowadays, we couldn't bring ourselves to it.Very seldom do I hate a movie, but I hated Pirate Radio. I honestly can't say a single redeeming quality of the movie. More than once during this torturous cinema did I feel like walking up and punching the screen while yelling obscenities. I honestly would've felt better if some criminal came by and robbed me of my 14 dollars prior to seeing this. At least then the money would've likely gone to a better cause than supporting the studio that green-lit this film.It's movies this bad that make me want to take a hammer to my fingernails just so I have an excuse to leave. I understand that it could just not be my cup of tea, and some people like this type of movie that lacks a plot. I'd compare this to 'Waiting', or 'Dazed and confused'. One of those movies where it's 90% dialog and, 5% people doing stuff, and 5% plot. This is one of 3 or 4 movies I've seen that totally deserves 1 star.",1,1,5,2 October 2013
American Hustle," What a waste of talent.
","Severely disappointed. I don't usually see movies based on critics reviews, but I had a lot of high hopes for this film. It was raunchy, and pointless. The story was not all that intriguing from the get go, the dialog was dry. The character development was slow and pointless. Yes, I understand the director, David O Russell is all about characters and simple plots. But, if the characters aren't interesting and you don't have a plot to fall back on, you just have nothing. At one point I did feel like walking out. The scene cuts are brutally long. Alfonso Cuaron has mastered the extended cuts. David O Russell has butchered it here.The only positive note is that our movie tickets were free, so we didn't actually pay to see it. I don't recommend this film. Don't believe the hype behind it.",3,3,6,3 February 2014
The Hangover Part II," Same Jokes- Different Location
","Let me start by saying that I love the first Hangover. I bought it on blu-ray and saw it at least 3 times in the theater. It was a great comedy and surprise sleeper.You can't say the same about The Hangover II. There were no surprises. It was the exact same movie, with the same re-hashed jokes, in a different location. I saw this in the theater when it came out, and the movie simply wasn't funny. I laughed one time the entire film. Honestly, I felt gypped that I had paid for it. My girlfriend that saw it with me had the same sentiment. She laughed 0 times.That being said I'm not looking forward to the 3rd installment unless they come up with a new plot, and some different jokes.",3,1,3,4 March 2013
