It," Overrated? A bit. Good? Maybe.
","I went into 2017's It with decently high expectations. I haven't read the original door-stopping 1000+ page novel that it's based on, but I did watch the incredibly silly TV mini- series. And while I ultimately came out disappointed, the film wasn't without its high points.The film takes place in the fictional town of Derry (in Maine, of course. Can't be a Stephen King story without a mention of Maine) in the late 80's (as opposed to the 50's, which is when the original book and the mini-series takes place), where a mysterious, evil force simply referred to as 'It', who takes on the form of a clown named Pennywise, appears every thirty years to feast on the fears of children. A group of misfit kids known as The Losers Club then must band together to take down the evil creature, all the while battling the evil forms the monster assumes.First, the positives: the child actors in this film do a fantastic job. They all have chemistry with one another and deliver their lines convincingly. Some of them may be a little one-dimensional, but they're all still really likable. The final battle with It feels triumphant because we've come to like these kids, which is always something a film should do. The forms It takes are bursting with creativity, even if the scenes they're placed in vary in spookiness. Pennywise himself is also pretty great, with Bill Skarsgård being able to almost match Tim Curry's intimidating (but also silly) performance in the original mini series.That said, this movie also has a lot going against it. This is one of the most tonally inconsistent films I've seen in a while, with scenes shifting from '80's music montage' to 'spooky predictable scares' within a matter of seconds, and it doesn't feel like an artistic choice. It feels like the producers wanted to shove in as many scares as possible, whether they fit in the scene or not, and it ultimately results in none of them standing out too much. As cheesy as the original mini-series was, it knew when and when not to attempt to scare the audience; as opposed to the 2017 movie where it feels like it's throwing something at you every five minutes.The bully characters, like in the original mini-series and a lot of other Stephen King stories, are extremely one-dimensional and unnaturally cruel (except for at least two bullies in the movie who may actually have restraint). The movie tries to give the main bully a little bit of explanation for his behavior, and it makes some of his mannerisms make sense, but in the end he's just another Stephen King bully. There are also points where it's kinda hard to tell if the movie's trying to be intentionally or unintentionally funny. Richie's dialogue, while endearing, I didn't find that funny. Meanwhile, in almost every one of It's encounters with the kids, he does something that may or may not have been intentionally funny. Not to spoil anything, but there's a scene in the climax where he lives up to his 'The Dancing Clown' subtitle and I'm not sure whether it was supposed to be funny, spooky, or both.In the end: 2017's adaptation of Stephen King's It is a mixed bag. Its scares are predictable, occasionally unintentionally funny, and far too plentiful, but the monster designs are creative. The child actors do an excellent job and their characters are super likable, but the side characters suffer from Stephen King stereotypes. The film's climax is incredibly triumphant, but it doesn't save the film as a whole. However, despite the film's numerous flaws, I didn't regret seeing it.

Halloween," An uneven yet effective classic
","Being the movie that popularized many of the tropes we see in slasher movies, does it still hold up? Much like Night of the Living Dead, the film manages to surpass the limitations of its budget and deliver a scary, occasionally uneven, experience. The slow pace and use of John Carpenter's minimalistic, yet effective score builds an atmosphere of dread, and the relatively smaller scale of the movie (the main setting is basically a single neighborhood, three houses at most) lets the viewer become familiar with their surroundings before the killings begin. The shots of Michael Myers appearing in and out of the darkness, as well as long shots of him from across the street, help give him a real presence and make him an effectively creepy villain. Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance are both excellent in their roles, with much of the supporting cast doing decently as well. Unfortunately, the film isn't without its moments of narm. While some times they're used effectively, the movie has an annoying habit of playing some loud, piercing sound effect whenever Myers does anything in the background, and it's not as effective as just having no sound effects and letting the audience take in the shot he appears in. A lot of times the dialogue can be hokey, and the ADR of Curtis' voice during the final chase can be pretty laughable ('THE KEEEEEEEEEYS!'). There's also the unfortunate matter that many of the scares can be seen as predictable because the film practically codified them as clichés, so modern viewers may find the movie boring as a result. That said, I still highly recommend Halloween as a great seasonal movie. The acting is mostly solid, the score is iconic and used well, Michael Myers makes for a great, creepy villain, and the smaller scale of the movie gives it a unique feeling of familiarity. If you're interested in the origins of the modern slasher movie, this is the movie to watch. Seven fake out scares out of ten.",7,0,0,1 November 2017
