The Ring," If the suspense doesn't kill you, something else will.
","I love movies that force me to play detective, and this movie does it for me.  From the beginning of the movie you are left hanging with one question..... 'What the hell?'The movie opens with a couple of girls talking about a seemingly urban legend about a video tape than when watched, causes the death of the viewer in seven days.  Of course the two girls build on skepticism shared by the audience until one of the girls dies--apparently she saw the video seven days ago.From that point, you are taken on a journey of disturbing images, unanswered questions, and unlikely revelations.The protagonist played by the beautiful Naomi Watts (Mulholland Dr.), a journalist who was related to the girl who got killed in the beginning of the movie stumbles across evidence about the videotape.  Unfortunately she ends up finding the video and watching it (Dumb idiot).  Ultimately believing that she has 7 days to live, she goes to great lengths to solve the mystery, and we are right behind her.This movie puts evidence and disturbing images in front of you and lets you analyze what they mean and how it pertains to the whole mystery. And in the end, when you think everything is resolved, the mystery continues.  It's a rollercoaster ride of tension and horror.  This is probably the scariest movie I've seen since Event Horizon.",8,0,0,16 October 2002
Spirited Away," More emotion than Mononoke.
","I went out of my way to catch this movie at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood and was blown away.  I'm a big fan of Miyazaki but have only seen Castle of Cagliostro, Princess Mononoke and now this. Where Princess Mononoke was high on action and environmental issues, Spirited Away is high on emotion and issues of love.When the movie begins, you are greeted with Miyazaki's astonishing art work and animation.  The bright colors and subtleness bring peace to your eyes. The story keeps you glued to your seat as it takes you to incredible places and introduces you to amazing characters.Miyazaki puts a 10yr old girl as it's protaganist. Her innocence, wits, and amazing courage make for a great heroin in this amazing adventure.  A la Alice in Wonderland.If anything, this movie made me feel young again.  As more and more incredible things unraveled before my eyes, I just sat there wide-eyed and full of wonder.The musical score by the legendary Jo Hisaishi (who composed scores for most if not all Miyazaki movies) is as usual astonishing.  His music combined with Miyazaki's artwork, makes scenes more breathtaking, suspensful and emotional.Catch this movie if you can find it.  You'll be taken on an adventure you will never forget.",10,2,3,22 September 2002
