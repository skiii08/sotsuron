The Rock," Rock´s hard
","I must say that I often go to the cinema, but very often not always satisfied, but The Rock is hard. I can only say that it is one of the best action-movies ever made. The combination with Connery, Cage and Harris rocks. And it doesn´t get worse when it is a Bruckheimer/Bay cooperation. Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson have produced some of the best films in movie history, and when they join forces with the director Micheal Bay it can´t go wrong. The soundtrack is the best of all of my 21 year old life, beacuse that it fits like a glove on the hand. There is not one song like other great movies that make it good, but the whole CD. If you haven´t yet seen the movie or heard the soundtrack (not combined), I strongly recommend to buy them both, I have.",Null,1,1,9 February 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great acting, great music but not yet as great as it can be.
","I have like millions of other waited a very long time for this masterpiece and when it´s finally came, I got a little disappointed. Though it´s great it could have been even better. Can´t say what´s missing, but something it is. Great sound and when you are in a theater you can almost feel that you are a part of the story. Can´t say that I know Ewan, but he was very good in his role as Obi-One. I hope that all of you who read this will go and see it. Though it is not a ten, it´s surely worth seeing.",8,0,0,5 June 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," Superb, Youth Comedy!!!
","Good to see that youth comedy´s are back in the game once again. Who haven´t starting to get tired of all of those drama comedy´s, who are not worth a dime. Now, you can see young stars on the uprising, and great acting in the same time. I saw it, and I loved it, see it you too.",10,0,0,26 August 1999
Independence Day," ID4 - the best sf movie yet
","Independence Day is a new movie with a very lot to offer. I think it´s great and can compete with the best, (Star Wars - trilogy). You can hardly say that these movies are alike, but George Lucas 'Star Wars' and Devlin´s & Emmerich´s 'ID4' are great sf films with a lot of good special effects wich makes the movie rise a lot above the usual genre. Not to mention the good actors as Bill Pullman, Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, Mary McDonnell for example. Great shots, and a tribute to the sf company wich made it seem so real, that hardly no one can say that it didn´t happen for real.",10,0,1,6 April 1999
