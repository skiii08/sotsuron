Airlift," Historically inaccurate and overrated
","I really hate it when Bollywood makes a movie based on a true story and completely distorts the facts. And what is going on with all the retarded ratings for Bollywood movies?!! Come on guys, Indian cinema has so much better than what's represented on the top 250 list. An 8.7 for this is absolutely ridiculous. I feel bad for all the non- Indians who trust the rating and go on to watch the movie and swear never to watch a movie from India again.Firstly, this movie has a lot of similarity to Hotel Rwanda. Especially the first 3/4 of the film. From the chaos happening outside, random killings, soldiers showing up at the place they were hold up, bribing of officials and so on. Although infused with its own original elements too, the movie was shamelessly ripped off.Secondly, the historicity of the movie. The movie made it look like there was some kind of genocide of Kuwaitees going on outside. While there were about a 1000 civilian deaths throughout the conflict, The depiction of random killings and rapes is absolutely ridiculous. Also, the actual airlift was downplayed by the Hotel Rwanda ripoff bits. Felt that should have been given more attention.Thirdly, why did they have to use an Indian guy to act as an Iraqi general.
