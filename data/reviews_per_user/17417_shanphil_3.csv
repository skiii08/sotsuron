Quiz Show," A fictional account that I cannot abide
","What is the problem with Redford? Is he trying to ruin the lives of people or sully their memories at the expense of their surviving family memories families. Like JFK before it, I can only hope that those who watch this movie will seek the truth. It is not in this movie. Charles Van Doren was not getting back at his father. His father was a wonderful, not boring, professor at Columbia. The Geritol marketing director played by Scorsesee (sp?) was not aware of the fraud. And neither Van Doren nor Stemple lived the lives stated at the end of the movie--apparently to give it a dour ending. Redford commits the atrocities of money and capitalism that he said he was targeting. Redford, the fake mountain man, grew up in Santa Monica and is just another Hollywood virtue monger who should examine his own virtues before speaking about (er, fabricating) the lives and virtues of others.I will admit that when I first saw this movie, I thought it very good, but after seeking the truth, I cannot in good faith give it more than one star. I will not recommend movies that criminalize innocent men and besmirch admired professionals without evidence.If you are interested, there is a Hollywood history of such Constitutionally protected atrocities. You should also search out the truth about the wife of William Randolph Hearst portrayed as a worthless woman in Citizen Kane. She wasn't a worthless woman and she was living and crushed by the movie. Hollywood blames Hearst for killing this great movie, but if he did it to protect this woman, he is to be admired. Just because it is protected by the constitution doesn't make it right.",1,11,24,23 October 2007
Love Actually," Objectification of women
","If you like movies that completely objectify women, this is THE movie for you. There is only one strong and confident woman in the entire movie (Emmma Thompson) and she's is punished harshly for it. All the other women are subservient to the men who treat them as objects and they get their men. (I suppose arguably Laura Linney's character doesn't let the new man in her life control her, but actually she allows an existing man in her life do so. I appreciate her love and loyalty to family, but, once again, a woman subservient to a fault.) If you watch this movie with the artificial world view that women are merely objects for men, then it is 10 stars. Watching it with the reality that they are much more valuable than that leaves me giving it 3 stars. I cannot recommend this movie. And it saddens me that people think of this as a Christmas movie. Open your eyes, people! (Written by a man.)",3,4,8,16 December 2016
