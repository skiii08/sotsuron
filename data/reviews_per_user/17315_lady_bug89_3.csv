National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Not exceptional, but has something that makes you wanna watch it to the end
","I actually liked this second movie, apart from my tendency of disregarding sequels. It's the sort of movie you would go to on a quiet holiday afternoon. It will certainly keep you in tension, although at some point the story line becomes predictable, especially if u remember the first movie well enough.Personally, i found the whole idea with Mount Rushmore hiding the City of Gold a bit out of place, but, all in all, all the tricks and clues they present have made me wish to know more history.Apart from all this, it certainly had some funny moments, great actors( including Helen Mirren, whom i was surprised to see ), and some cool ideas, like driving on red light and hacking the London police database to get the photo .",7,1,3,1 January 2008
Lost in Translation," Well, i have definitely lost my words...great great movie
","After seeing this movie, i still can't snap myself out of this state of profound meditation it gives. There are just so many metaphores in the movie, you have to take 5 minutes and get back to the bitter reality.It took me 5 years to watch this movie, and only because it slipped my movie addict overcharged mind. But apart from the junk I happen to see everyday ,'Lost in translation' is by far the most beautiful and meaningful movie I've seen lately.The story line is simple, a neglected wife and a middle-aged actor meet, from all the places possible, in Japan, in a classy, standard hotel. What do they have in common? Insomnia and a feeling of always being in the wrong place with the wrong people. Did you ever get the feeling you're the only normal , sane, human being on a 5 miles's area ? This feeling of being inaproppriate creates quite an unique bond between them. There is a very vague sexual tension, because their connection is more a spiritual one, a mutual understanding.They are both married, both unhappy, and somewhat disappointed of what life turned out for them. But they find answers and strength and most important hope , in each other . From Bill Murray's cute and innocent little jokes to the final scenes of the long awaited kiss that was bound to happen,the movie just leaves you breathless. In the ending, I could almost feel the tension, the moment that was bound to come, the departure, the returning home to the usual routine. I finally understood that those special people we meet in life,that mean something,those moments won't last, and that makes it all so beautiful and worth remembering.I can't imagine anyone else but Bill Murray playing Bob Harris, the role fits him perfectly, and as for Scarlett J., I have always thought that all her acting is done with so much passion, and she's so natural.In the end, it's a movie about loneliness that brings people together, and that changes into something greater than love, greater than friendship..watch the movie and you'll get it...",8,0,4,27 January 2008
Love Actually," You can't say u like romantic comedies if u haven't seen this one
","I can't stop watching this movie every year around Christmas, it just gets me in the cuddly, corny mood, and it practically makes me put aside all the worries and troubles i have had all year long, reminding me of what really matters : family, your loved ones, sitting back and enjoying life's greater schemes.I just love the way it slowly uncovers the stories, each of them carrying a specific type of love : secret, betrayed, shy, childish and innocent, outspoken, brotherly , ...And you absolutely have to admit it has such an admirable cast, I mean, Hugh Grant and Emma Thompson ( a couple that without doubt reminds you of Sense and sensibility ), Liam Neeson, Julianne Moore, Colin Firth ( my favorite actor for romantic comedies ) and many more...And I have to say my fav stories are that of the singer and his manager and the one of the guy who's in love with his best friend's wife( that was really unpredictable ).So, if you are in a mood of a romantic movie, no matter what time of the year it is , i strongly recommend this movie, because after all, ' Love Actually is all around ' , 'written in the wind, it's everywhere you go...'",8,1,2,5 January 2008
