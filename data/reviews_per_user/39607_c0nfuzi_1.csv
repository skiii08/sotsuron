Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," jay Leno meet jackass meet crash
","so f-ing funny. the added value is only the daring & pushing the limit of politically correctness... over and over. that's enough. jay Leno, referring to the interviews that jay Leno do with the people on the streets and get surprised by their answers. in this movie we are surprised by the answers, funny yet sad, and the reactions which are simply funny. jackass, for all the stunts, daring and funny.and crash, the Oscar movie of 2005, because it depicts the gap of social evolution between not only the us and the rest of the world, but also between the states. we already know that, but this is a funny way to remind us that the world is crazy.nobody cares about that, but i have to point it out anyway. the story line is easy, the ending is lazy, and some scenes aren't as genuine as we would like it to be.",8,1,7,6 November 2006
