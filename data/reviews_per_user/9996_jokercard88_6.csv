Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," um... so what if it's funny
","Um... So what if it's funny. The humor is only based on him being a outlander and it isn't clever (save a couple laughs like **him jerking off outside of Victoria's secret**). However, the plot is nearly nonexistent. The noticeable plot links involve **giving up on marrying Pamela Anderson and being broke in the streets of California for one day (both underdone and clichÃ©).** And as for the fortunately (yet slightly) edited climax it wasn't funny and it creeped me out.....but granted it WAS pretty funny to the point of redemption. The comedy suceeded in keeping from getting old. The narrative was alright and I did keep my expectations high for a thirty minute period (about the middle for when my judgement starts kicking in. Should've seen THE PRESTIGE or FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS and just rented Borat.",7,0,3,8 November 2006
Requiem for a Dream," I never knew a movie could be this sad
","Oh my god, I cannot believe this movie.  I mean, I never knew a movie could be THIS sad.  Schindler's List, Forrest Gump, what not...Can't even compare.  This is one depressing movie even in the middle of the film I was crying. Enough of that though.  Let's talk about why this movie was so sad. First off, you have your average four city citizens.  Your average mom, very nice and challenged with raising her son without a father and when some show calls and says she's won the right to be on TV, she takes pills to help her diet. her son who has a beutiful girlfriend he loves very much.  His girlfriend who, in order to get money, has to dress up, with makeup and clothes ect., and er, hem persuade them (what happens in her story near the end is insanely sad in fact, it's the saddest part of the film).  Then his friend who is black.  His friend, Tyrone, gets deep in the drug selling market.  He's getting deeper and deeper into it to the point where the only way out is to go to jail. Show this to your kids, and they're free to skip health class all they want because this movie is more persuasive than any crap educational documentary.  It's just so sad watching four people you care about getting tortured by drugs.",9,0,1,21 September 2002
Finding Nemo," It was a pretty good story, but the jokes were LAME
","I was prepared to love this movie like Monsters Inc, but all things considered, FN really let me down.  The story and pixar graphics make this a great rental, but barely worth the price of admission.  Some of the characters were likable, the angelfish, Dory, who suffered from short term memory loss was easily the best character, and Nemo was ok but the broken fin thing was retarted.  The word 'retarted' also speaks for just about all of the jokes.  'Lookie, it's a turtle speedway, but turtles are slow'...ha ha ha-no, not funny.  If you want a decent kids movie, check it out, cuz it's a movie you won't fall asleep over,m and your kids will enjoy it. 6/10",8,0,0,10 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Not quite as good as the first/Merry and Pippen's story was the best
","There are a few flaws this movie suffers from, and let me clear them away first, then I'll say why Fellowship is better (and it is).  For one, Merry and Pippen's story wasn't nearly as long as the Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli story or the Froddo/Samwise/Gollumn story.  This is a shame as Merry and Pippen's story was the best.  Pippen transforms into a much more leader quality person.  He's the only character in Two Towers that show signs of character development.  His disision         (!POSSIBLE SPOILERS IN THIS NEXT SENTENCE!) -to convince the tree-men to attack Isengard- (.END OF SPOILER.)was brilliant and probably my favorate part in the movie.Second, the part where (!YET ANOTHER SPOILER!) -Aragorn falls off the cliff, then later arrives (late) at the fortress of Helm's Deep- (.END OF SPOILER.) was very forced and affected the next few scenes in the Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli story.Taking those flaws into account, the movie still might've been better than the first in the trilogy, but there's more that makes it not as good as the first.  This isn't a flaw though, it's just a different style, and one that I don't like as much (or just aren't used to).  While the first movie was straightford with all the characters in the same spot, the second has three seperate stories.  The one with the most screen time is my least favorate, the shortest story is my favorate.  The switching between stories is well done, but let's hope at some point everyone will get together (or just the four hobbits, that's also fine) in the third movie, and I also hope the hobbits get as much screen time as the other three.There go all my complaints.  Otherwise, Two Towers is everything I wanted and more.  The battle at Helm's Deep is an epic battle in every sense of the word (Legolas sliding down a staircase on a sheild is classic).  The camerawork is spectacular and a milestone in movie history.  Love the ending!",8,0,0,5 January 2003
Sin City," violence never looked this good
","First off, there's a couple of things this movie perfects ten times better than any other movies ever released. The sometimes poetic yet sometimes tough narrative that runs throughout the whole movie is without a doubt the best I can recall ever hearing in a movie. The stylized violence (And believe me it's worse than Quinten Tarantino's TRUE ROMANCE) is the most brutal and cool looking violence ever. This is heightened by the also stylish black and white and red all over animation. And the best moments that the two things collide is when the violence that really pushes the envelope is censored by a scene when the character and the blood is plain white and the background is100% cell shaded black.However,the plot is a mixed bag. When the movie begins, the incredible narrative and animation blow you away. fifteen minutes into it and it was the best movie I ever saw. However, thirty minutes later, it still felt like the introduction. The shifting back and forth through characters and the constant murders never slowed down. While the narrative was still incredible, the beginning of the plot would never give way. Later on however, and I was enjoying myself once again the violence was even better and the unpredictability over who would make it on top this time made me truly enjoy the movie again. The violence was bloody and the gun fights between characters was unpredictable as even ten shots to the chest would not kill even the lesser important characters (meaning only the cops).And the last link in the plot of the movie was probably the best part (besides the stunning beginning) as the character at the start, Bruce Willis's character (my favorite of the three narrative characters) selflessly saves the lead female character.so with perhaps the best presentation value and an unpredictable plot, this movie is definitely worth seeing.",8,1,2,3 June 2006
Gangs of New York," (I have yet to see Two Towers but...) this is the best of 2002 so far!
","Outdoing 'The Road To Perdition,' GoNY is a massive time machine that TAKES YOU BACK TO INDUSTRIALIZED, NORTHERN AMERICA (circa 1840's or so). You feel like you are actually witnessing the rivalry between the natives and the dead rabbits.  THIS FILM IS ONE HELL OF A MAGIC CARPET RIDE THROUGH TIME!  The costumes, locations, everything  extremly convinces you that this IS industrialized America you are witnessing. But you feel that you aren't just witnessing life in industrialized America, you feel that you're witnessing a guy, more or less like you (provided your a male of coarse) who is devastated at the loss of his father (which causes him to be less like just about any of you).  You feel like you're witnessing this man constantly pondering whether or not to avenge his father's death.  As if there's a telepathic bond between you and him, you're telling him:'kill that son of a b!tc#. The acting is superb.  Cameron Diaz transitions excellently from fairy tale Princess (Shrek), to street wise hooker/theif/'turtle dove' (that's...what kind of role she plays after all) and is entirely convincing. Leonardo DeCaprio is good for some parts of the film and is perfect for annoying love scenes, HOWEVER, DECAPRIO ISN'T CUT OUT TO BE A HISTORIC BARBARIAN, HE DEFINATLY NOT AS STREET WISE AS EMINEM IN 8 MILE.  DANILLE DAY-LEWIS (as Bill the Butcher), HOWEVER, TURNS IN ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMANCES IN A LONG TIME (since Fellowship of the Ring perhaps).  He's the perfect villan, he maintains eye contact with who he's speaking to, he speaks his line like he means them, he acts his part enthusiastically, he's simply brilliant! The violence is startlingly high.  MARTIN SCORSESE IS TRUELY A MASTER AT DEPICTING VIOLENCE (see Taxi Driver and you'll know what I  mean).  The first fight scene between the natives and the original dead rabbits is brutal and well choreographed (excellent camera shots).  The later fight scene between the revived dead rabbits and the natives is even bloodier, yet confusing.  There are too many things going on at once and the shroud of smoke makes it even more confusing.Overall, the only thing keeping this film from perfection is the confusion the last battle scene causes and the scene with all the nude hookers (we would have gotten the idea that they were hookers even if they were dressed).  The ending is simply excellent.10/10, best film of the year so far (w/out seeing Catch me if you can, Adaptation, or Two Towers).",7,0,0,23 December 2002
