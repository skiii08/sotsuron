The Sound of Music," Don't Miss it
","Movie for everyone everywhere. One of the movies in those times which can be seen anytime. Music is good and songs excellent. The initial sceneries are enthralling and create more interest for the movie. The roles were enacted superbly. Have seen it multiple times and enjoy it vividly every time i c it again. The music touches your heart and the lyrics are written very well. The direction and the locations are perfect. The characters apt.A simple movie which does not involve any thinking and can be enjoyed with complete relaxation. One of the Best dramas made. It has all the mixture in it and never in the movie is there a scene kept for the sake of keeping it, everything is just perfect.This is a masterpiece which gives boost to the movies of this kind. The new generation prefers thrillers actions and horrors and simply think these kind of movies to be slow and boring, but this one really contradicts them and is one movie where time passes by... The movie has a little bit of austrian patriotism and the climax dedicated to it.Overall an excellent movie to enjoy with family and a good movie to enjoy in lonely times :)",10,1,8,29 May 2005
City of God," You can neither hide nor run and you eventually end up getting caught
","Another movie with one of the characters narrating the story.In this case a real life story. The direction is just perfect. If he had just shown it as a single long story it wouldn't have been that effective. Breaking up the whole story and connecting them from one to an other was a perfect idea which worked out perfectly well. About the movie , city of god as i cud perceive it was mainly a city of blacks where violence is at its peak. Gangsters,Drugs,Deaths,Gunshots are pretty common for the people living in the city of god. Maybe this sounds common as we see this in many movies, but what is uncommon is that a person burying his alive wife, a young boy killing all the people in a motel, small boys who can hardly speak roaming around with guns etc. Part of the story is based on revenge. Everything for just the desire of a person to become the boss of hoodlums. An excellent movie with a strong story and perfect depiction of reality.",10,1,3,30 July 2005
Man on Fire," Its the movie which is on fire not the man :)
","The best action movie of 2004 with all the sentiment added like a caviar. Washington's en-action of the character is flawless and fannings is the cutest kid who only knows to be happy in life. The whole movie revolves around Mexico city where kidnappings are at the peak . Daniel is dakota's bodyguard and when fanning is kidnapped, he is on a blaze, Thats where the title comes into picture - 'A man on Fire'. The movie is violent and has pretty nasty scenes but are masked by the good nature of Creasy(Washington) and (Pita)Dakota. The part where both get together is very good and enjoyable. And the revenge just depicts how much Creasy loved Pita. All in all a fantastic movie, a masterpiece worth watching.",10,0,2,3 September 2005
The Truman Show," MindBoggling
",How great can a persons imagination be?? is the question ppl ask when they finish watching this masterpiece.Don't start doubting yourself after seeing this movie. The point worth mentioning is it is a recursion .. u watch the people watching someone else :)) Jim carry with one of his best performances. The direction and screenplay were just perfect and the settings too good to be true. Overall its a collection of gr8 things. The movie is about Truman(Jim Carrey) in a small island and guess what there are people watching Truman other than you to be precise. Because of his childhood incident he is afraid of water and so he never left the island.The overall performance was good though majority of the time its Truman on the camera or shud i say cameras. The climax is excellent signifying what a human wants and that no one wants the world to be perfect and safe. Its just a get together of goodies. Don't miss the fun and the adventure of Truman and his show.,10,0,0,5 June 2005
