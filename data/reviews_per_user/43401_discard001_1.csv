Iron Man 3," 'Unbelievable'... but not in a good way.
","This was a Disney/Marvel collaboration. Perhaps one problem was that it was too much Disney and insufficient Marvel.The thing I was conscious of at many points throughout the movie, was that in ridiculously violent fights between unarmored and unprotected simple flesh and blood humans... no one gets hurt. In Road Runner cartoons, when the anvil flattens the Coyote, it's quite funny due to its ludicrous overstatement. But the real parts of a movie involving humans -- which are intended to be believable -- really need to remain believable... or it's asking too much from a mature audience.As a Science Fiction lover, I am more than willing to suspend my disbelief for the sake of immersion into a new idea. I loved the first IronMan, and have watched it many times. So I will gleefully imbue a robotic suit with any levels of strength and power the story may require. That's fine. Bring it on. Thrill me. But I know the limitations of an unaided human body. We all have one. And what I saw far too much of, against human flesh, was a level of coyote-flattening violence that was utter nonsense.Despite the fact that I have no doubt IronMan will break US domestic box office records, as it already has overseas, I think that 'Oblivion' was the far better movie so far this summer./Steve.
