The Ring," Better than most
","Its hard to come by a scary movie nowadays,my best guess it will not dissapoint the majority of horror fans out there.Pay no attention to high profile critics such as Ebert who call this movie boring.Boring NO creepy YES.The ring is simalar to feardotcom but much better,the  ring deliveres the gooda expecially at  the end of the moviee.Bottom line this movie will end up going to  horror movie heaven where all the other good horror movies go.",Null,0,0,22 October 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," 3 times the charm
","I  will not waste your time  commenting on the two prior movies.If for some possible reason you have not taken revolutions yet,do not be disscouraged by all the poindexters throwing religion and all this intillectual mumbojumbo at you.Straight goods is you got your goood side you  got your evil  side and the hero and tthe viillan kind of like Luke skywalker  and Darth Vader.You get to watch them kick each others  ass hoping near the end of the movie good will win.Yes its been done before but never this good.Ive seen thousands of movies and this is up there with the very best that goes for the whole trilogy as well .",Null,0,0,11 November 2003
