Child 44," Russian pronunciation?
","Tom Hardy speaking with a Russian pronunciation and the wrong grammar when everybody else speaks normal English is the most stupid thing I have ever seen in a movie. For this alone, I'll give it 3 stars. As for the plot, which is based on a real event, the famous Chikatilo murders, it's been done a lot better in another movie with Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland. I don't remember the title,though.",3,4,9,28 March 2017
