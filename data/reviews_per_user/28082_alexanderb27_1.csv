The King's Speech," A wonderful film which is definitely Oscar-winning!
","The King's Speech was not essentially aimed at people my age & I was quite surprised that I thoroughly enjoyed the film throughout!The movie is about George VI who is required to speak publicly to the UK & to most of the world. However, he has a stammer.The King's Speech shows you the journey of how the Duke of York went through many methods to try to overcome his speech difficulties.Firstly, the acting was fantastic! Colin Firth fits perfectly for the role of King George VI & Geoffrey Rush was perfect for Lionel Louge! The rest were great in their roles but Timothy Spall didn't fit the part of Winston Churchill.The whole film kept me on the edge of my seat and there were quite a few moments which made the audience giggle! The screenplay was fantastic and the visuals were amazing! There is so much to say I just can't fit it all into a review!Overall, a simply brilliant film and I recommend it to everybody even if it's not normally your kind of film. A well-deserved 8/10!",8,0,1,13 February 2011
