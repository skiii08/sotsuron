Antz," The only Woody Allen movie I really enjoyed!
","My son and went to this and we both thought it was extremely good. The cute little story and the Woody Allen character are interesting. This is probably the only movie that has Woody Allen in it that I really enjoyed, maybe because I didn't have to look at him.Anyway this movie is a must see if you enjoy fine animation movie making!",8,0,0,27 October 1998
The Butterfly Effect," Not your typical Hollywood Movie
","This movie leaves you thinking afterwards. Sure there may be some wholes in the story line, but it has a flavor of a European movie. It doesn't end like you would think it would, but ends where you can use your imagination. Do your self some good, go see the movie with an open mind. I agree with most of the positive comments about this flick. Be young in your heart and just go with the flow.",10,0,1,1 February 2004
The Game," What a ride!
","This is Michael Douglas's best movie. I enjoyed him and really liked the story even if at times it seems impossible, suspend belief and enjoy this ride.Nice photography too!",10,0,1,21 October 1998
Mission: Impossible II," I am Tom Cruise fan...but this movie:(
","I just went and saw this movie. Talk about over kill on long drawn out scenes. The motorcycle chase and the fight scene that follows were so drawn out. I realize this is Hollywood, but this tries to be like James Bond, Face/Off and it just doesn't work for me. What a waste of Mission Impossible stuff. The Utah scene is good. The actress is very sexy and seems like she has some acting talent. I am one of the few people who really enjoyed the first Mission Impossible. This is one of Tom Cruise's worst films. I really liked him in 'Eyes Wide Shut' 'Jerry MaGuire' 'Rain Man' etc, but this is a movie that you could watch and not listen to and still know what is going on! I really wanted to like this flick, but I find it lame.",1,1,2,27 May 2000
Pretty Woman," Better on DVD
","I watched this on DVD and really enjoyed more than the first time I watched this movie, especially listening to the audio commentary by Gary Marshall.",8,0,0,21 October 1998
A Beautiful Mind," It's About Time
","This movie deserved all the awards it received, if not more.Excellent story telling about a difficult subject. I was most touchedby the strong bond of love that existed between John and his wife. Iwas glad to have watched this and to of  learned more aboutsomething that I thought was not discussed openly in America.Hollywood got  this right for finally giving Ron Howard andCompany their proper respect.

Vanilla Sky," Thought provoking!!! loved it
","I really liked this movie and it is not your typical main streamHollywood film. I am glad that Cruise did this flick. The movie goesby really fast and then end is where some of the loose ends getstied up and explain. However, I still think I will need to see it againto offer what  I believe the story evolves. This picture is like an artpicture I think, people will see different things in the texture andthat's what I found enjoyable.",9,0,0,17 December 2001
The Godfather," The Best adaptation of novel to Movie
","Well the Godfather is really one of the best adaptation of novel to book. I know that there are probably few of the newer viewers of this movie who read the book, but if you first read the book when the book first came out in the 70's and waiting patiently for the movie to be released you weren't  disappointed in the movie. I think it is the best gangster movie and if you are fortunate to own the DVD you are in for a treat. There are lots of goodies here.
This is a movie that is just a good story and it makes you feel fo this family.",10,0,2,22 October 2001
