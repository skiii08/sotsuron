United 93," An amazing film honoring the brave passengers and crew on flight 93
","United 93, written and directed by Paul Greengrass, tells the story of the tragic events that occurred on September 11, 2001 when four planes were hijacked, one of which was United Airlines flight 93. Aboard flight 93 were forty passengers and crew members along with four male hijackers. Those four men had the intentions of crashing the aircraft in the nation's capital Washington, D.C. The United Airlines aircraft did not hit its intended target, instead it crashed in Pennsylvania. United 93 shows that in the face of danger people from different backgrounds, cultures, religions and social status can unite for the common good.While no one truly knows what happened on flight 93, the film does a magnificent job depicting what may have occurred on that tragic day. Although the people on board the flight and those working on the ground were all important to the entirety of the film; I found three characters that were vital to the story. Major James Fox (playing himself), Ben Sliney (also playing himself) and Trish Gates (as Sandra Bradshaw) played their roles very well and made them realistic. While everyone was confused about the number of hijacked planes and where the planes were headed, Major Fox, Sliney and Bradshaw remained as calm as to be expected in such a difficult situation. Another aspect that made the film all the more worth watching was the actors and actresses in it. None of them were famous or even remotely known, which allows viewers to be drawn into the story.Although there is more diversity among the passengers in United 93, the theme of the film reminds me of the movie 10,000 Black Men Named George. In that film thousands of African-American men were uniting in order to improve the civil and economic rights of black people. The fight may have been very different, however it was very important that everyone come together as one and 'fight' for what was right or what they believed in. The individuals in 10,000 Black Men Named George united and changed the course of history. The passengers on United flight 93 also worked together as one and prevented certain events from happening.Music and lighting were key techniques used throughout United 93. Low key lighting was used during key moments and especially in the cock pit of the aircraft. High key lighting showed the importance of the passengers, the unity among them, and possibly to show the heightened awareness that the terrorist had towards the passengers. The music in United 93, which was directed by John Powell, also contributed to the film. The music enhanced the mood and the theme of the film.United 93 is an overwhelming film that shows the devastation that was witnessed by many on September 11, 2001, and is important because it shows how people can be brought together. The movie is not necessarily about what the government and certain agencies did wrong on that fateful day, but what forty people did that was right. United 93 gave a new meaning to 'United We Stand Divided We Fall.'",10,3,6,22 March 2008
