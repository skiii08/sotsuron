Hereditary," A slow paced family drama with ultimately no pay off.
","I went into this film knowing exactly what type of film it would be, having seen The Witch, that I found to be a slow paced 'artsy' attempt at horror and It Comes at Night, which I highly enjoyed, but even with that prior understanding of this film type I still came away disappointed. This film was nothing more than a slow burning family drama that in the last 20 minutes became a slap dashed cliche ridden attempt at a horror film.
 The trend now seems to be for a horror film to be taken 'seriously' it needs to shed all aspects of actual horror...all these 'artsy' horror films that are just long winded drawn out borefests. 
 This film could have been great, the score was on point, the acting was great but it just lacked any attempts to be scary at any point.
3/10. Try better.",3,3,6,19 June 2018
