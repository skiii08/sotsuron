The Blair Witch Project," Horror in its most pure origin.
","***** out of *****The Blair Witch Project is a movie worth watching. Being already a cinematographic phenomenon I think deep analysis should be made. Miryck and Sanchez have accomplished something only Hitchcock in Psycho, Carpenter in Halloween, Kubrick in The Shining, dePalma in Carrie and Spielberg in Jaws had before.I know that a lot of people are (and will be) disapointed, because this film is not a 'fright' film. You don´t see the murderer running behind his victim or listen a creepy frightening violin chord every time the director wants you to get scared. It is not a movie filled with popular teen TV stars dressed in the latest fashion clothes geting butchered.
This movie is about what really scares us. I think movies like Scream, Scream 2, I Know..., I Still Know..., Urban Legend, etc are good horror movies, but the kind of fright they make you feel is the kind of terror you feel when someone is holding a gun to your face to robe you. The Blair Witch...manages that kind of pain you feel when you´re alone at night in your house and suddenly you hear a creak or a noise and you don´t know its origin, where it came from... It could be anything...And that is more frightening.Heather, Josh and Mike are such excellent actors and the movie is filmed and edited in such a way that the desperation, the nervousness and the fear they feel are transmitted to you automatically. The creepy and eerie aspect of the trees in the night (and even by day) contribute to the excellent atmosphere created here and its necesary to make you feel there... with them, being the fourth student on the project. This is not a fast paced movie. In an intelligent move, it takes its time and starts slowly, increasing speed in the second act and finally ending in a way that you´ll feel someone has crashed you against a glass window at 500 miles per hour. Believe me, it´ll leave your heart pounding a lot of time after you leave the theater. Just remember terror lies not in what you see, but in what you hear and don´t kow where it comes from...and can´t see...Warning: Watch the Documentary 'Curse of the Blair Witch' and visit the official site before you watch the movie...you´ll enjoy it more...",Null,0,1,12 November 1999
Armageddon," 'This movie is a big joke'
","** 1/2 out of *****When I saw this movie´s trailer, I got excited beyond belief. I knew that like in Deep Impact, America would manage to save the day...again...in the same year. Don´t get me wrong, I love the United States, specially Disneyland, Houston and Las Vegas. But why is it that when the world´s in danger, us third world countries have to wait for americans to save us? I know it´s because we don´t have the economical resources, but what we do have is extremely brilliant people...but let´s get back in track...I think that what happened with Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer was the same thing that happened to Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich. Bad Boys and The Rock were excellent movies. So what they did, was to think of an excuse and with it create a 'story' and put it on film.I expect when I go to the movie theater, to see more than things being blown up... I expect to see some story, care about the characters or something. None of this things happened with Armageddon.For starters, Bruce Willis was cast to act as Bruce Willis, at this point, I really can´t remember his character´s name. Now, there are some irregularities with this movie... Explosions and sound can´t happen at space, because there´s no oxygen! Remember elementary school? With no oxygen there´s no fire? Steve Buscemi´s character (from whom I can´t either remember his name) starts firing a remote controlled automatic machine gun...Why would they carry a machine gun into space? Did they expected to fight some aliens, or to even find any? I loved Jonathan Hensleigh´s writing on Jumanji and Die Hard:With a Vengeance...but, what happened to him on this one? The lines of his characters were so irrelevant, that I really dídn´t care for them: 'The clock is ticking' (Why is this line so famous?) There was another scene that excited me when I first saw it, but then I thought about it and was kinda illogical...If they´re activating the nuke, to detonate it from earth, by simply pushing a button, is there a reason for the weapon to have a timer? Or was it just an excuse for the 'clock is ticking' line, or for the blue wire/red wire sequence? The other thing that was an assault to my senses, was the vertiginous direction. No image lasted more than 5-6 seconds. There were some scenes where I couldn´t understand what was happening. I did liked the New York destruction scene, but is it easy (or logic) to hide an asteroid the size of Texas, after the massive destruction of a city, to the whole world? What I did liked about this movie was that I was so worried about Willis´ team succeeding in their mission, that all improbabilities slipped past through my mind. Trevor Rabin´s score was excellent, but it was difficult to pay attention to, it with all the sound effects. This movie is better in just one thing than Deep Impact, it cares about the world´s reaction. In Deep Impact, the matter was treated as a local problem, without caring for the rest of the world. I do love action movies, and even vertiginous ones (The Rock, The Peacemaker and Crimson Tide) but if you make an excessive use of your cinematographic elements you can make a mess out of your movie.",Null,0,1,25 January 1999
Independence Day," 'Not too believable'
","**1/2 out of *****I discovered something about Devlin and Emmerich with Stargate that I confirmed with ID4 and Godzilla...their films start with good suspense, but they reach a point in wich their products take a dive into the deep oblivion of cliches. They start writing their scripts by thinking of a movie with epic proportions, but by the time they get to the third act, they have made such a mess of the story that they don´t know how to finish it and think of an extremely desperate resolution.ID4 trailers were amazing. To me, it was the must-see movie of the year. And the movie starts with the beat of a rock music track. Devlin and Emmerich knew how to capture a sense of reality on the scenes of the chaos and fear the arrival of spaceships the size of cities would cause. Even the cities´destruction scenes were amazing, but after that, the movie failed to surprise me. And the lines! What´s wrong with you guys?: 'The clock is ticking' 'Time´s up' 'Now that´s what I call a close encounter' 'You know how I like to make an entrance'Here in Mexico, we call those kind of lines...'Gringadas' But I know it´s unfair to blame all americans for the things a reduced group of people do. I usually reply: 'Why is Mexico never included when something happens in a worldwide level movie?' I´m glad we weren´t included on this one. At least the thought of being one of the few countries that weren´t destroyed, makes me think it´s really good to be a small country after all.Then I tried to visualize The President Of The United States aboard a fighting airplane defending his country... Hard to imagine. There´s also one point of the movie that troubles me... With all that technology, wouldn´t the aliens have an anti-virus for a simple human computer virus? Kind of ilogical, isn´t it?I Know a lot of americans clapped and cheered on the movie theater... patriotism is a rough feeling. I would´ve too, even cried with the president´s speech if I had been an american or if the movie had been mexican...I have to accept that. O.K., the special effects, were great, but a movie cannot rely only on it´s FX. Everything this movie left me with, was one question...How many times has the United States saved the world? (cinematographically speaking)...",Null,0,1,25 January 1999
Titanic," James Cameron´s vision of one of the greatest tragedies of all times
","***** out of *****I have to be honest. I saw this movie in the United States  (In Houston, to be more precise), and I was extremely reluctant to see it, because when I first had notice that Cameron, one of my favorite action directors was going to recreate the Titanic tragedy, I thought: 'Where´s the fun in that?'So, I sat down with a large popcorn in one hand and a large coke oin the other, expecting to see Cameron fail BIG TIME! I have to say, that when the movie started, the music and the underwater scenes of the Titanic on its underwater and cold grave haunted me. And when the movie finished I was so shocked, that I couldn´t even speak.I´ll start with the cinematographic elements and then I´ll continue with the personal ones: The movie´s cinematography is beautiful,the edition amazing, the costume design is excellent, but the art direction and set design... I have to say that the artists that worked on this film, deserve all the existing awards for that marvelous effort. James Horner´s music is extremely beautiful and it is used in the exact moments...It is at times so subtle that it can make you weep and at moments it is so intense it can make your palms sweat. Leonardo DiCaprio makes such an excellent performance that there were times I could swear he is really like that. Kate Winslet is perfect as Rose DeWitt Bukater and the loneliness and desperation her character feels is so well portrayed that I really cared for her. James Cameron made a movie so beautiful and well researched, that he managed to create a movie that is a perfect amalgam of the historic, drama, romantic, disaster, fiction and even the action genres. The movie is in its first hour and a half, a movie in which we get to know the characters. We get to care for them or hate them. Then, the Titanic, crashes with the iceberg (Some people gasped at the moment we were first confronted with the iceberg as if they didn´t know that moment was inevitable in the movie), and the movie turns into an action movie, with dizzying chase scenes. The disaster feeling of the movie is always there...and you sometimes, can feel crushed by it. What I also liked about this movie, that at first was one of the main reasons I didn´t want to see it, was its TITANIC budget... Waterworld´s publicity was its budget and that movie is one of the worst movies I´ve ever seen...so I thought, what could change?...Oh! But not Titanic... Every cent of those 200 million dollars is on that screen, and that is something I appreciate about every Cameron film I watch. I think this movie deserved those 14 Oscar nomination and the 11 it won, because James Cameron and his team, outdid themselves for this movie. The research Cameron did, and the way he manages to make fiction, alternate with historic moments is magnificent. I cried...this movie´s vision about the tragedy is so well done that I couldn´t avoid it, and I still cry every time I see it.In the movie a character says: 'Even God himself couldn´t sink this ship'. Well... that ship sank, and I don´t know if it was God or Nature but what I do know is that someone tried to teach Humankind a lesson...James Cameron makes a movie, approximately, every three years, and because of that, his movies are so exact in every detail. I will be desperately waiting for his next movie...It will no longer matter if he changes to another genre again...",Null,2,3,9 February 1999
