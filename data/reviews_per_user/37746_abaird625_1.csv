Captain Phillips," A must see movie!
","This movie surprisingly kept me at the edge of my seat. When I saw the trailer I thought that there was going to be non-stop violence throughout. I was wrong. However, parents that are reading, it is very violent despite its PG-13 rating. It is rather disturbing and bloody. You have to remember though that it is about pirates who try to take over a ship. This movie was astonishing though. Quite honestly, I believe that it is Tom Hanks's best performance yet. The pirate leader was great too. That was surprising since his current job other than the movie is a cab driver in Chicago. He had won the audition. I would not recommend this movie for someone under the age of 14. It is a very mature concept for kids. The end was very disturbing and little kids would not sleep for a while. It is definitely worth seeing and I will definitely be buying it when it comes out.",8,2,5,16 October 2013
