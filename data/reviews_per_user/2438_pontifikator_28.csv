The King's Speech," This is a well-done film with insight into historical events which may have an impact on current goings-on.
","The movie revolves around the relationship between Albert, Duke of York and Lionel Logue. There were no transcripts of their training sessions, of course, so what exactly happened seems to me to be based on creative license, although a member of the Logue family served as adviser to the filmmakers and Logue kept diaries and wrote letters. Not much is known of his techniques for working with stammerers, but the movie suggests that Logue worked with his clients as friend and confidante. As Logue works with the future king, we learn that his father (George V) pressured all his sons into becoming more like the father. This pressure and several other problems seem to have lead Albert to stammer. The movie unfolds with considerable humor and much warmth. The two protagonists spar, as the Duke of York is unaccustomed to familiarity from anyone, much less an Australian commoner, but they find a common ground based on trust. It's almost a boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl plot as the Duke learns Logue is not a doctor and has no credentials. But Logue regains Albert's trust, and the movie builds to the climactic scene where the newly-crowned George VI makes his inaugural speech to his subjects. The moment is beautifully done with great musical accompaniment. Despite the seeming lack of interest and drama, the film is interesting and dramatic. The film is well done and worth seeing, even though it lacks gunfights and narrow escapes from alien thugs.And now a moment's worth of historical context:The oldest brother (at the beginning of the movie he's the Prince of Wales) is first in line to succeed his father. The effects of George V's pressures on his older son are more subtle than Albert's. The real Edward was linked romantically to several older women, most (perhaps all) of them married. His last affair was with an American woman named Wallis Simpson, who was divorced from her first husband and married to her second when her affair with Edward began. His family strongly disapproved. King George V was working with other European leaders to staunch the bloodletting Hitler was causing, mostly by what has been called a policy of appeasement: give Hitler what he wants and hope he stops. Hitler, however, was an immoral sociopath who wanted only one thing: more. Eventually, Stanley Baldwin then Neville Chamberlain failed as Prime Ministers to stop Hitler's aggressions and demands. We need to keep in mind that during the Great War (now known as World War I), Great Britain lost an entire generation of young men in war -- a loss the English did not wish to repeat. It was very much in the interests of the citizens of the Commonwealth to avoid war at almost all costs. In the film, Logue's sons appear to be of draft age, so the potential loss of his children is quite real. We think today of Churchill as the speaker of Britain's anguish and desires, but the monarch was expected to rally the citizens and be the mainstay of a nation very much against war should war break out.George V was very much up to the task, making the first radio broadcast by a British monarch and requiring his two sons to do so as well. The Prince of Wales had no stammer, but the Duke of York had a severe problem. His wife, Elizabeth, encouraged him to see doctors, and he was plagued more by them than he was by the stammer, which remained despite all treatment. Eventually Elizabeth was led to Logue, who convinced Albert that he could be cured. George V died in 1936 at the height of tensions in Europe, which saw Nazi Germany swallowing countries with the consent of other countries and rearming in violation of the Treaty of Versailles. The Prince of Wales became King Edward VIII. However, Edward refused to renounce his affair with Mrs. Simpson and instead announced that he would marry her. The King of England is titular head of the Church of England, and the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Prime Minister stated that the marriage was not acceptable; if Edward married Mrs. Simpson (her divorce was in the works), the prime minister would resign and no one would take his place, causing the government to fall. Edward decided he could not give her up, and he chose to abdicate. Edward was named the Duke of Windsor and after his marriage his wife was the Duchess of Windsor. During this time, Princess Elizabeth (daughter of Albert and Elizabeth) was about 10 years of age. What impressions this made on her I do not know. However, I can't help but think that the current Prince of Wales, Charles, and his marriage to Princess Diana and his affair with Camilla Parker Bowles, followed by his marriage to Camilla after the divorce from Diana and her death, has reminded Queen Elizabeth II of the crisis involving her father and his older brother.King George VI developed lung cancer (an irony you'll appreciate after seeing the movie) and died in 1952 from coronary thrombosis at the age of 56. Elizabeth succeeded him at the age of 26. At 84, she has given no indication of resigning, allowing Charles to ascend to the throne; he is 62. The Queen Mum died at the age of 101; Queen Elizabeth II may have a long rule ahead of her yet.",7,1,3,2 January 2011
Casablanca," One of my 3 all-time faves
","This is the best movie I've ever seen, ranking as one of my three all-time favorites.* Bogart and Bergman are pitch-perfect in their roles, Rains is debonair and corrupt, Veidt is snakely and villainous as he should be, and Henreid is forgettable, but who cares? We even get Sidney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre, along with S.Z. Sakall.The typical movie is boy meets girls, boy loses girl, boy gets her back. In this version, Rick has already lost Ilsa, he gets her back, then he gives her up for the greater glory of France. Well, okay not France but for democracy and all that's decent. The dialogue is excellent with more memorable lines in each minute than most other movies generate in the whole show.Sigh - they all come rushing back: 'Round up the usual suspects!' 'Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.' ''I came to Casablanca for the waters.' 'It's a desert - there are no waters.' 'I was misinformed.'' 'Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.'The movie presents Rick as a cynical egoist, interested only in preserving himself. But we learn from his dossier that he's been involved with freedom fighters in several countries, then we learn of Ilsa. We decide that Rick is a cynic because she broke his heart, and he thinks he was a sap. Cynicism is a shell. Ilsa walks into his gin joint and back into his life, and Rick's shell thickens before our eyes. Of course, as the movie goes on, we see his shell melt away, and Rick emerges as the hero we knew was hidden deep inside all along. The dialogue is excellent, and so is the directing (Michael Curtiz). 'Casablanca' is full of minor characters who add to the richness of the world Rick lives in, adding depth that his character hides. Through his interactions with them, their affection for him and his gruffness toward them, we see his cynicism for the shell it is. Inside that steel exterior beats a heart of concrete.The ending is superb, melodramatic, and heartbreaking without being maudlin and tearjerking. Noble, but not overdone, maintaining the breeziness and snappy dialogue in the face of Nazi jackboots. (Okay, so jackboots don't have faces, but you get the point, see.)Everything works. It all comes together and stays together throughout the whole movie.*I call 'Casablanca' a movie because it's a great romantic movie about a guy and a girl. I call 'The Dresser' a film because it's about marvelous characters, and we get to watch their development during the film; 'The Dresser' is art on a high level. 'The Princess Bride' -- I dunno where it fits. It's just my favorite fantasy epic swashbuckler that rises so far above whatever genre it is that it doesn't fit anywhere.",Null,1,2,18 September 2011
The Big Lebowski," A well-deserved cult classic with a stellar cast
","This is a well-deserved cult classic. I won't call it Chandleresque even if it is based loosely (really loosely, dood) on 'The Long Goodbye.' It's a stand-alone comedy in its own right, and the characters are totally off the wall and completely credible. It's filled with laugh-out-loud funny scenes (the spreading of the ashes on the ocean is a stand out), John Goodman is huge, and John Turturro is totally over the top.The movie bears repeated watching over the years, and you'll appreciate the small things more as you stop following the plot and start following the bits that are going on during the scenes.",Null,0,1,3 January 2012
As Good as It Gets," A fairly shallow comedy with very good laugh lines
","This is a fairly shallow comedy with very good laugh lines, very well played by the actors. The deep problem is that Jack Nicholson's character, Melvin, is seriously sick and hates women, leaving me to wonder why Carol (played by Helen Hunt) falls for him -- and the only clear motivation is selfishness on both parts. She's the only one who tolerates his despicable behavior, and he pays for medical care for her sickly child. It's a funny movie, but it has some serious weakness in my view as to the characters' development. I would contrast Carol's behavior with that of Muriel's (played by Geena Davis) in 'The Accidental Tourist.' In 'As Good as It Gets,' Carol's love interest remains his sick, obsessive-compulsive self. In 'The Accidental Tourist,' Muriel and her son have helped her love interest grow into a relationship with her. I consider 'As Good As It Gets' (a more telling title under my view) to be a Hollywood ending where old, powerful producers and directors get their way with young, attractive would-be stars.",7,0,0,6 November 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Great shallow movie
","This is a great shallow movie. No pretensions, great action, great jokes, pretty good actors. Directed by the well-known Gore Verbinski (no? not well-known? C'est la vie) and starring Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, and some woman I forget.Like Tommy Lee Jones, Johnny Depp has pretty much stopped acting and started playing the same role in all his films. (Tommy Lee Jones is now acting like Richard Crenna in Hot Shots! Part Deux or Wrongfully Accused or maybe Rambo IV, I forget.) But I digress. Depp here plays Jack Sparrow beautifully (and famously as Keith Richards), and the film kept me laughing from the opening scene to somewhere near the end.It's a great buddy film, although lacking the ensemble acting of 'The Princess Bride.' The bad guys are not really bad, the good guys are really, really good, and our hero gets the girl. The special effects are excellent and used to good, uh, effect: creepy when they should be creepy and hilarious when they should be funny. I was sorry when it was over.",8,0,3,21 August 2010
Hot Fuzz," One of the funniest movies I've seen
","Co-written by Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, directed by Wright, and starring Pegg, this is one of the funniest movies I've seen. I compare it to the 'Hot Shots' movies by Abrahms and Proft. Part slasher flick, part buddy movie, part action picture, this film keeps me laughing all the way through every time I see it.Pegg plays Sergeant Angel, a hot-shot cop that no one can stand. He's in a big city, and his boss sends him to a small, rural village just to get rid of him, hoping Angel will resign out of boredom. However, Angel discovers a crime ring in the small town. The supporting cast is great: Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall as detectives Wainwright and Cartwright -- or is it the other way around? The Equalizer's Edward Woodward, One of my favorite scenes shows Sergeant Angel doing research to discover the murderer. It's played the same as all those Schwarzenegger movies where Arnie's character is suiting up for the assault, jamming knifes in sheaths, shoving ammo magazines in assault rifles, jerking harness tight -- while Angel is photocopying newspapers, highlighting words, circling errors with dramatic music adding tension and excitement!The movie bears repeated watching, as you get more of the jokes when you pay more attention than the dialogue warrants at first watch. The movie includes every action movie cliché that you can remember. It's incredibly well-written, and Pegg nails the role. I think Wright and Pegg really hit their stride here.",8,0,0,14 April 2012
Constantine," Contains a spoiler
","'Constantine' has the best Satan I've ever seen (in a movie). Peter Stormare (also in 'Fargo') brings true savoir faire to the role of Lucifer. Keanu Reeves plays the hero, John Constantine, and my initial reaction was that he couldn't carry it off. I pictured Constantine as a hard- bitten dick like Sam Spade, and Reeves just doesn't have it. However, his attempt to be hard- bitten grew on me -- maybe Constantine is really a gentle, caring guy trying to play tough. I think it works.The plot is taken from a comic book that I've never read. I think it's called 'John Constantine: Hellblazer,' or maybe just 'Hellblazer.' I don't care. Most movies based on comic books suck pretty bad, and I had low expectations on this film. But 'Constantine' very much exceeded my expectations solely because of Stormare and Tilda Swinton - more on her later.Okay, the plot. Angela Dodson (Weiss) is a Catholic woman whose sister appears to have committed suicide, a big no-no in the Catholic Church. This means the sister (Isable, also played by Weiss) is refused a Catholic funeral and will burn in hell for all eternity. The name Angela is obvious, of course, but it turns out that Isabel means 'God's promise.' Constantine has a reputation as a sort of supernatural private eye, so naturally she seeks him out and puts him on the case - did she fall or was she pushed? So Constantine and Angela pursue the case in this world and the next, learning there's a plot to let Satan and his minions overrun earth. Can they foil it? Of course.Director Francis Lawrence keeps the film moving, lots of action and special effects (although I though his depiction of hell was mundane), unburdened by boy-girl sparks between our hero and his client (it is a comic book, after all). Two pieces of casting makes the movie rise above its comic book status: Stormare and Swinton.Swinton plays Archangel Gabriel. I have no idea if the role was written with a man in mind, but if so, no concession was made for Swinton to play it. At one point she's seen in a mannish suit, and I don't recall references to Gabriel's gender (and I may well have forgotten -- what gender are angels, anyway?). She plays the role to the hilt. At one point, Constantine says with all sincerity, 'Gabriel, you are insane.' Best line in the movie, in part because it's totally true. Gabriel has definitely gone off the deep end, and Swinton plays Gabriel not as a thrashing lunatic but as utterly sincere.Stormare plays Lucifer with all the panache of a mafioso who's got a job condemning to hell everyone that he can, he's good at it, and he likes the job. Total confidence, total competence. There are a couple of special effects hinting at his satanic powers, but it's pretty much just Peter Stormare giving Satan character. I really liked his work.",7,2,4,24 May 2009
Catch-22," Brilliant screenplay
","Directed by Mike Nichols, the screenplay by Buck Henry is totally brilliant. The novel by Joseph Heller is itself brilliantly written, with nuances and subtleties many readers miss. Henry caught the gist of the novel and got it on screen, using the device of returning again and again to an airplane with a scene we don't fully see, showing us a little more each time, then fading to white as we get the voice over of the next scene. We get the circularity of the novel and the scattered sanity of Yossarian as he struggles to keep his shredded reality less tattered if not totally intact.The cast is incredible. Nichols gives us an all-star cast without the drivel of such disasters as 'A Bridge Too Far' and 'The Longest Day.' The cast includes Alan Arkin, Martin Balsam, Richard Benjamin, Buck Henry, Bob Newhart, Anthony Perkins, Paula Prentiss, Martin Sheen, John Voight, and Orson Welles, among many, many others.Henry had to make a movie out of the novel, so he made some hard choices, excising characters and situations that some find disappointing. My suggestion is to see the movie as the movie without comparing it to the book; on the other hand, I'm astounded at how well Henry captured the essence of Heller and his work. Jon Voight is chilling as Minderbinder, who is in my very humble opinion the lynchpin of the movie. When Minderbinder tells Yossarian, 'Then they'll understand,' the full impact of World War II (and who's the real enemy) shatters Yossarian's weakening sanity.For me the end of the novel and the end of the movie are unsatisfying, but the ride is still worth it.Trivial notes concerning the people involved in the movie. Mike Nichols also directed 'The Graduate,' with Anne Bancroft and Dustin Hoffman. Charles Grodin (Arfy Aardvark) was supposed to play Benjamin, but couldn't agree on a salary with Nichols, so Bancroft suggest Dustin Hoffman to Nichols - she'd heard about Hoffman from her husband, Mel Brooks, who had just signed Hoffman for his movie 'The Producers.' Hoffman bailed on Brooks and did 'The Graduate' instead. Norman Fell (Sgt. Towser) played Benjamin's landlord in a short scene (also involving Richard Dreyfus) in 'The Graduate.' Bob Balaban (Capt. Orr) was in 'Midnight Cowboy' with Jon Voight (and Dustin Hoffman, of course). Buck Henry wrote a TV series for Richard Benjamin (Major Danby), who is married to Paula Prentiss (Nurse Duckett). Orson Welles (General Dreedle) did the voice-over narration for Mel Brooks's 'History of the World.' Mel Brooks and Buck Henry developed 'Get Smart.' Bob Newhart (Major Major Major) and Peter Bonerz (Capt. McWatt) were in The Bob Newhart Show together. And Susanne Benton (Dreedle's WAC) had a completely unrelated role in the totally unrelated 'A Boy and his Dog.' Hollywood is a small town.",8,13,17,10 April 2011
Pan's Labyrinth," An interesting movie of the magical realism genre
","This is an interesting movie. I believe it is of the magical realism genre: the director (Guillermo del Toro) has, in my opinion, left wiggle room for two views. In this film, Ivana Baquero plays Ofelia, the daughter of Carmen (played by Ariadna Gil). Carmen is recently widowed and has been wed by the influential Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez) at the depth of the Spanish Civil War. Carmen is pregnant with Vidal's son (he knows it's his male heir and will brook no dispute).Vidal is a heartless murderer, stamping out the revolutionaries to keep Spain safe for Franco and the Catholic church, and much of what del Toro puts in the film is a denunciation of both. Del Toro is excellent in his drawing of Vidal's character - we see Vidal in his dressing room and on the battlefield, compelled to heroics by his father's heroic death in battle. Vidal is a monster: sadistic and heartless. He is reality in the Spanish civil war.Ofelia spends time reading fairy tales and believing them to be true. Her mother chides her gently; Vidal takes her to task more strenuously. Del Toro shows us Ofelia's fantasy land, and we are left with enough vagueness that some can say her fantasies are real and some can say her fantasies are her escape from the hell of the war. And given the monster in her life, who can fault her for her escapism?If the fantasy is correct, Ofelia is the daughter of the king and queen of the underworld, and she strayed above ground for too long and lost her memory. She needs only to find her way back to assume her rightful position as heir to the crown. She finds a faun in an old maze who proposes to test her to see if she really is the princess, and she accepts the challenge. In the fantasies she faces monsters and monstrosities, sometimes failing, sometimes succeeding. If her fantasy is reality, she passes the ultimate test and goes to her mother the queen and her father the king of the underworld, takes the throne and lives happily ever after, beloved by all her subjects.We are, however, given an alternate universe. A heartbreaking world where the monster is her mother's husband, where life has no value, and where no one can pass the ultimate test. If this story is reality, she fails and does not live happily ever after.You choose which version to believe is true, and then you can think about what your choice says about you. Pay attention to all the details, fairy tales, rules, and books. There is a rich story in this movie, and your attention is well-rewarded.",8,1,4,1 April 2011
Battleship Potemkin," Propaganda that surpasses its intent
","This film is first and foremost an object of communist propaganda. It was directed by Sergei Eisenstein in 1925, and it glorifies the mutiny on the ship against the officers of the czar in 1905. The film is silent, and it is more noted today for its use of montage than for its message. Eisenstein's direction is far ahead of its day, foretelling many of our modern techniques.The story is that the men on board the ship are routinely flogged, fed rotted meat, and treated as subhuman scum by the officers. At the point where they rebel, a dozen or so men are going to be shot for not eating their soup. (Yes, really - not eating their soup was correctly viewed as insubordination.) The enlisted crew convince the armed guards to come over to the side of rebellion, and they take over the ship. All of the officers disappear, and we never learn their fate. One sailor is killed by an officer, though, and his body is taken into the port of Odessa where it lies in state. The thousands of citizens of Odessa file by his bier (where there is a sign 'Killed for a plate of soup') and weep. I found this completely lacking in credibility, but it was necessary for the uprising for the towns people to join in brotherhood with the ship's men. Hundreds of citizens hop in their boats and sail out to the Potemkin with more food than could possibly be eaten.The famous scene where the czar's police march down the steps shooting people occurs, the crew of the Potemkin launches a broadside against the opera house, symbol of the czar, then turn to face the approaching squadron of czarist ships. The Potemkin sails out to meet the squadron and do battle if necessary. The rebelling sailors ask the squadron to join them in their rebellion against czarism, the squadron does, and they all live happily ever after under the red flag of communism.The issue is why is 'The Battleship Potemkin' seen as a great film, while Leni Riefenstahl's 'Triumph of the Will' is seen as nothing but propaganda, dragging her name down in villainy for ever after?I'll propose that 'Triumph of the Will' glorified one man, and that its groundbreaking uses of tracking shots, cranes, and the like were broken under the weight of its intolerable burden: Hitler.Eisenstein's film, on the other hand, pioneered the use of new editing techniques to tell the story of plain men who rebelled against their oppression. No one monster is singled out for glory in 'The Battleship Potemkin,' so after the years have passed, we can look at it more objectively.Eisenstein's use of montage was to juxtapose several shots in quick sequence, pumping drama and meaning into a scene where one static shot would have remained empty. With his quick cuts of individual sailors cheering and showing exultation, we get a more personal feeling of their excitement than showing ranks of more or less faceless sailors waving their caps. Eisenstein showed us not a crew but individuals. The famous scene on the steps of Odessa is actually long and contains a large number of stories, not just the pram rolling down the steps with the armed police marching down after it. Eisenstein shows up rich and poor, lame and healthy, joined together to happily embrace the rebellion of the ship's crew. He shows a series of shots of individuals gleefully cheering and talking to each other, saying All for one and one for all. We get to know each person in the happiest moment of their lives. Then the czar's police show up with bayonets fixed to their long rifles as they march in step down the long stone staircase, shooting people as they move, stepping over the bodies in step. And it's not just people - it's the humans we saw and exulted with minutes ago.What Eisenstein does in the shooting scene is to show, for example, a woman on the steps looking up, shouting in fear. He shows her again from a closer view. He shows her yet again as the camera dollies in to a close up, then he cuts to a close up showing blood running down her face, her glasses broken over her eye. Without a zoom lens, this is the same technique used by Hitchcock in 'Vertigo' and Steven Spielberg in 'Jaws.' Eisenstein forces us to see that woman's face and the horror of her murder is forced upon us. These shots probably also qualify as jump cuts, and they certainly violate the rule of continuity, as we see the same person repeatedly from different positions as the camera is moved in on her as quickly and relentlessly as the approach of her killers.We see the human cost of bravery on an individual level rather than a crowd, which would make the scene have less impact. This was a great insight on Eisenstein's part: the cinematic impact is in the person, not in the mob.Eisenstein is mostly successful at drawing our attention to the abysmal life they lead as subhuman parts of a well-run machine, then at their excitement and freedom after they mutiny. The problem is that Eisenstein was promiscuous - we get the same exciting montage of scenes of the men raising the boarding stairs and stowing them as we get of them hauling up the cannon shells and gun powder and stowing it in the turrets as they prepare for battle.Although the propaganda aspect is a little ham handed in the scenes concerning the dead sailor and the townspeople, overall the film works for me as an example of the Soviet view of montage. Eisenstein's photographic compositions were excellent, and his use of the ship to frame the action kept my interest piqued during some of the longer, uninteresting speeches.",8,1,1,23 November 2009
Taxi Driver," Brilliant movie
","Martin Scorsese's brilliant 1976 film about Travis Bickle has the best music score I've ever heard. Bernard Herrmann died the day he finished his recording sessions for the movie. Herrmann did the music for the radio broadcast of 'War of the Worlds' and the films 'Citizen Kane' and 'Psycho,' among many others. The score for 'Taxi Driver' has no memorable songs, no hit singles. It's tied inseparably to the visuals, searing and complete. The opening of the movie is riveting, with steam coming from the manholes and a cab appearing through the mists like some monster from a deep lagoon as Herrmann's menacing, sinister score fades in and out. When you've never seen the movie, you don't know what it's about, but you know immediately it's going to be bad. And it is.If you haven't seen the movie since it came out, it's time to see it again. It's been over thirty years, and Scorsese still has it nailed. It's riveted down and bolted. He welded it. It's still a scorching movie. DeNiro plays Travis Bickle, a Vietnam vet with the scars to prove it. Inside and out. Bickle is seriously mentally ill. He's Holden Caulfield back from the Nam.* He keeps telling people he's got to do something, but he doesn't know what. We know he's going to explode, and we wait with a sick feeling in our stomachs for the carnage.Jodie Foster was 12 when she played Iris, the child prostitute. It's amazing to see her and realize how good she was. Her scene with Harvey Keitel when he talks her out of running away is mesmerizing. (Some scenes were shot with her 19 year old sister as a body double, by the way.) And her lunch with Bickle is totally natural. She was a star right from the beginning, holding her own with Robert DeNiro and Harvey Keitel. Incredible.Keitel is Iris's pimp, the epitome of all that makes Bickle sick, the scummy garbage of New York. Named Matthew, Iris calls him Sport, and she loves him. He manipulates her relentlessly and shamelessly because he makes a lot of money having a 12-year-old whore in his stable. 'You can do anything with her,' Sport tells Travis, then he spouts a laundry list of filth, sickening Bickle. Keitel is one of my favorite actors; I've never seen him fail in a movie, and he doesn't disappoint here. Sport puts a name and address on Bickle's urge to do something.I've seen Cybill Shepherd in two movies where she played similar characters: Betsy here in 'Taxi Driver' (with Albert Brooks as her opposite number) and 'The Heartbreak Kid' as Kelly Corcoran (with Charles Grodin playing her suitor). In both movies her character is pretty much empty - a blonde who's gotten by on her looks and who has no personality. Betsy provides a whitebread, sane counterpoint to Bickle. The problem is whether we're better off being the sane counterpoint, involved in an election campaign where nothing the candidate says means anything, surrounded by whitebread, incompetent, safe, well-meaning people who truly care whether the candidate's bumper stickers are printed correctly.Betsy sharpens our focus is on Bickle as he slowly spirals down, letting slip his facade of control, losing his grip on himself, in his solitary hell. Herrmann's score gives music to Bickle's seething anger and danger, underplaying the tempest we feel must be raging unseen in the black night of Bickle's soul. We never see Bickle's torment on his face, but we know his flat affect is the mask of his will to do something, anything to let loose his locked-down demons.'Taxi Driver' has lost nothing over the years. The characters, the directing, the music all work. See it with a good sound system.The movie was produced by a threesome that included Julia Phillips, author of 'You'll Never Have Lunch in This Town Again.' If you haven't read that book, I recommend it. It's free at your local library and well worth the price of checking it out. She also produced 'The Sting,' 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind,' and a few others. She had a lot to say in her memoir, and she said it well. Julia Phillips died of cancer a few years ago, I'm sorry to say.*To carry that analogy further, Iris is both Holden's prostitute and Holden's sister, Phoebe. Bickle protects her.",9,0,0,27 February 2010
Lost in Translation," Excellent, thoughtful movie
","Sofia Coppola wrote and directed this quietly excellent movie starring Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson, and some other people who don't matter. The gist of the movie is that Bob Harris (Murray) and Charlotte (Johannsson) are alone in Tokyo with some time on their hands. They begin a caring, affectionate, sex-free relationship that can't go anywhere, and then it ends.Coppola contrasts the weird, alien world of Japan with relatively ordinary Americans stuck there for various reasons. Charlotte's husband is there on a job; she tagged along because they're recently married but she can't be with him while he works. Bob is a has-been American actor who's still popular in Japan, so he's paying the bills doing commercials for a whisky. Coppola does an entertaining job using Bob to show the discrepancies between the mores and lives of Japanese and those of Americans. Bob meets Charlotte, and each has the opportunity to share their mutual alienation with someone alike. Coppola's script is very good, and Bob and Charlotte's relationship grows naturally, although we know it's doomed because of their age difference. (Actually, it was nice for a change not to have a gorgeous twenty-something falling in love with a fifty-something guy, which seems to be the fantasy of all the men in Hollywood.) Johansson and Murray are wonderful in the film. The characters' relationship becomes relaxed as the two get to know each other and grow more comfortable with their affection, and the two actors wear the roles well. We follow them around as they explore Tokyo, have fun, sing, eat, and such - just a couple of tourists. The scenes of Tokyo, whether on the street or through their hotel windows add meaningfully to their lostness.Nothing much happens during the movie. We see the characters meet, grow together, then part as their worlds take them in other directions. It's a life we've all lived and know. A very good adult film that lets us look in on the lives of other competent adults who handle things appropriately for their ages -- things including loss.",8,2,4,6 December 2011
Burn After Reading," The Coens nail another one
","The Coen Brothers nail another comedy with a wonderful cast playing wonderful, screwball characters. This movie is a riot. The cast includes George Clooney, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, Tilda Swinton, and Brad Pitt.Malkovich is superb as Osbourne Cox, a fired CIA agent who writes his memoirs in defiance of the agency that dumped him. A copy of his memoirs ends up in the hands of the employees of a local gym - Linda Litzke (McDormand) and Chad Feldheimer (Pitt), who are incredibly dumb and driven. They try to blackmail Cox, and the story spirals into complete chaos.George Clooney should stop acting for anyone other than the Coen brothers. I don't know what they have that brings out the lunatic in Clooney, but every time he's in a Coen movie, he does the best job he's ever done. He's a good actor the other times, but for the Coens, he's one of the best of today's actors. Malkovich is excellent all the time, and he's used by the Coens superbly - well, I said superb about him a paragraph ago, but it's still the right word. His physical comedy here is hilarious. He's a great actor, and he gets to let it all out as Cox.Among the nice things about this movie is that there are no babes (well, maybe Pitt, but we'll think more about that later), no slow-motion martial arts fights, no big gun fights with full automatic weapons, just funny scene after funny scene, with a few shockers thrown in to keep us off-balance. Pay attention - you'll be well-rewarded. I don't think there was a wasted scene in the whole shebang.",8,4,5,22 July 2012
Little Miss Sunshine," A sick, genius screenplay
","Michael Arndt wrote a sick, genius screenplay. I saw reviews for 'Little Miss Sunshine' when the movie came out and passed on it. Whatever the descriptions were, they totally missed it. This is a very funny comedy about failure. Epic failure.'Little Miss Sunshine' was directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, and it stars Greg Kinnear, Alan Arkin, Steve Carell, and Toni Collette, along with others. Arkin won a best supporting actor Oscar for his brief time on the screen, and Arndt won for best original screenplay.I don't know who did the costuming (I assume Nancy Steiner), but the clothes were wonderfully awful, especially little Olive's choices. (Mom's clothes sucked pretty bad, too.) Dinner seems to have been take-home buckets of chicken all too often, given Grandpa's comments. All the details of a harried, wrecked homelife get nailed in the opening scenes. Nobody has time to think about dress or food, much less be good at anything.In this family's life, everything goes horribly wrong, and it's so horribly funny that I had to keep backing up the video because I wasn't through laughing when something else happened. Lee Marvin said his horse should have gotten an Oscar in 'Cat Ballou,' and the family VW van should have in 'Little Miss Sunshine.'Although ostensibly about Olive's quest to win a child's beauty contest, this movie is no more about beauty than 'Bull Durham' is about baseball. If you liked 'The Station Agent,' you'll like 'Little Miss Sunshine' (and vice versa).",8,1,4,21 March 2011
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," A slow slog
","SPOILER RIGHT OFF THE BAT-------------------------I hope it's not a spoiler to say that Ford does shoot James somewhere near the end of the movie. I thought it would never get to that point, though.The cinematography is very good. I enjoyed looking at many of the scenes. But the parts of the movie I liked best were the voice overs. And when you like the voice overs better than when the characters are characterizing and expositioning, there's a problem. I understand the movie was cut originally to four hours, and then it was trimmed down to the two and a half hours it was released in. I'd suggest cutting another hour out.The part of the movie after Ford shot James was the best, so I'd leave that as is. I'd figure so many feet per minute. Then I'd just take a scissor to the parts in front of the assassination until I'd cut an hour's worth of feet out. Snip here, snip there, then see what I'd left in. I'd be satisfied with whatever was left.I understand Casey Affleck got rave reviews for his complex portrayal of Bob Ford. I think Brad Pitt was playing Warren Oates. I really liked Paul Schneider as Dick Liddil and Kailin See as Sarah Hite. The problem I have is that the movie was a series of scenes, some connected with each other, some not. Sort of like portraits of people. Long portraits. Like you're sitting there watching the portrait process as the paint dries. Great cinematography, lots of pretty scenes. But the only thing that got the movie going was the voice overs where we're being told what happens in between the static portraits and landscapes.Until the end, when we see Bob Ford and his brother Charley spiral into self-parody and death. The life of Jesse James was made less interesting than the unraveling of the life of Ford.Roger Deakins was cinematographer for this film, and he's been involved as cinematographer or director of photography for a few score others, including 'Sid and Nancy,' 'Barton Fink,' 'The Hudsucker Proxy,' 'The Shawshank Redemption,' 'Fargo,' 'The Big Lebowski,' 'O Brother, Where Art Thou,' 'Intolerable Cruelty,' 'The Lady Killers' (you can't win 'em all), 'Jarhead,' and 'No Country for Old Men.'Andrew Dominik is credited as director and writer.",4,7,11,19 June 2010
Bridesmaids," Not a chick flick -- guys will like it, too
","Although called a female comedy, this is chock full o' laughs for the guys, too. Co-written by Kristen Wiig and Anne Mumolo (who also has a small role), 'Bridesmaids' stars Wiig as the woebegone near-spinster who has a knack for picking losers as her lovers. It was directed by Paul Feig, and co-stars Maya Rudolph as the bride who picks Wiig's character as Maid of Honor. This was Jill Clayburgh's last movie before her death from cancer. Somebody picked great music for the movie, and the Wilson Phillips performed at the end. The writing and the performances knocked my socks off. 'Bridesmaids' was nominated for Academy Awards for best original screenplay and for best supporting actress for Melissa McCarthy for her role as Megan. Although McCarthy shines, I preferred Rudolph's performance, but I don't pick 'em for Oscar Awards. Both Rudolph and Wiig are alums of Saturday Night Life, and the movie abounds with others from SNL. Judd Apatow is credited as producer, although there is a string of names of other producers of various sub-types.Casting was stellar. I don't know how much Allison Jones had to do with it all, but she deserves an award for picking the right actors for the roles. Casting Jon Hamm as Ted, Annie's jerk boyfriend, is only one of the strokes of genius in this movie. This is not a momentous film worthy of preservation for the eons, but it's a drop dead funny laugh-out-loud movie. At two hours, it'll fill up an afternoon quite well on some dreary cold day you don't want to go out.",8,1,3,20 April 2013
The Princess Bride," One of my faves
","This is one of my three all-time favorite movies, and I'm not really sure why. Everything just works. Rob Reiner, the director, nailed it. Peter Falk and Fred Savage nailed it. Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, and Andre the Giant nailed it. Christopher Guest totally nailed it with his villain-with- the-flat-affect characterization of heartless, truly heartless, evil. Even Mark Knopfler nailed the score.How can you not love a movie with the characters 'The Ancient Booer' and 'The Assistant Brute.' I've watched it several times since it came out, and it draws me in every time. It's a truly iconic fantasy.My current theory on why the movie works so well is that the characters seem to respect each other. The Dread Pirate Roberts, Inigo, and Fezzik not only respect each other as adversaries, they seem even to care while they are adversaries, making their morph into friends completely credible. It's ensemble acting at a high level, and it makes it almost necessary for us the viewers to care about them, too.",Null,1,3,12 July 2011
Revolutionary Road," Powerful and subtle
","This bleak, bleak film was hard for me to watch. Leonardo DiCaprio absolutely mesmerized me as Frank Wheeler, and the supporting cast was phenomenal. Kathy Bates and Kathryn Hahn were heartbreaking; Michael Shannon was alternately dead and manic as the certified insane version of Frank and April Wheeler (April was played by Kate Winslet). But I'm getting ahead of myself.Frank meets April and they get married. April has dreams of becoming an actress, but she's lousy. Leonardo DiCaprio's attempt to soothe April while blowing off her ambitions was utterly believable. DiCaprio's Frank is a shallow jerk with no soul and no ambition. I didn't know DiCaprio was this good. 'Revolutionary Road' shows their lives together in the Fifties, as they end up in the march of grey flannel suits in grey, sterile lives. Shannon's character, John Givings, gives voice to their hopeless emptiness. Frank and April make a big decision to blow it all off, move to Paris, and live a happy, fulfilling life. April actually has a plan, and it looks like she can pull it off. Her dream of being an actress may have foundered, but getting out of the rut of suburban Connecticut, office life in Manhattan, and forced parties and entertainment definitely looks doable. The characters in this movie are relentlessly human. From the beginning, Frank has no real appreciation for April's dreams, but he eventually realizes she's a human being with some feelings. They have two kids, and Frank wants to be a good father to them, and succeeds for the most part. He's not perfect; neither is April; but who is? As the years pass, Frank seems to be more aware of April's needs, less inclined to dismiss her. I watched their ups and downs, but there was a serious note throughout that kept me edgy, upset. Thomas Newmans' music echoed the tension without being tense; his theme was brilliant, spare.The picture of life in the Fifties shown in this film is stultifying, claustrophobic, suppressive. One had to give parties, one had to dress correctly, one had to say the right things ('Oh! You shouldn't have! This is _too_ good!') - one had to conform. Frank had the peer pressure of conforming at the office, and April had the wifely peers pressuring her at the home. This kind of pressure makes diamonds. Or it crushes souls. It was a pressure that welded Frank and April into one crushed soul.April doesn't seem to realize consciously her need to get out of the Fifties; Frank doesn't have that need at all, but he goes along because he intuits that it's a requirement. April has their tickets, their passports, and their dreams all in her hand, ready to go. She even has her job lined up. She'll support them while Frank looks after the kids and looks for work. I watched April's happiness with dread. It's the Fifties. Wives didn't work. Wives didn't support the family. Winslet's April has the brains and the ambition, the soul, that Frank lacks. But it's the Fifties. There's nowhere for her to go with it. There's nowhere for a woman's dreams.'Revolultionary Road' is powerfully subtle. And the end I was left drained. Empty. There's no Hollywood ending here. I kept thinking of Rick telling Ilsa, 'We'll always have Paris.' In 'Revolutionary Road,' I knew they'd never have Paris.",9,0,1,5 October 2009
Across the Universe," A stellar performance from Julie Taymor
","Another star performance from Julie Taymor. It helps if you like the Beatles, since 'Across the Universe' is a story connected by Beatles songs performed by the various actors, with cameos from the likes of Joe Cocker, Bono, and Eddie Izzard. Taymor is a fantastic director, and she gets fantastic performances from her cast and crew.And then there's The Beatles. I've seen and heard their songs covered by artists for lo these 40 or 50 years, and it's amazing how much can be gotten from their words and music. Taymor and her performers wring The Beatles dry in several of the sets. Pairing a dead white Vietnam vet with a Detroit ghetto kid with background vocals by a black choir was inspired. And Taymor gives us the best visualization of American foreign policy I've ever seen.Not everything worked for me, but what didn't work for me may well work for you. It's over two hours, so be prepared for a break or two, but it never dragged for me. Taymor is inspired, and she got a cast and crew that was inspired as well. Great effects, great choreography, great lighting, great performances. Be aware that the cast does not imitate The Beatles, they sing the songs within the context of what's going on in the movie. This leads to some interesting differences in what you thought the songs were about. And never fear: the songs stand up to it. The Beatles were that good.",8,0,0,4 February 2012
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A great story with great feeling
","Directed by David Fincher, this movie is based on a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, published in 1922. I've read the short story, but ignoring it when I review the movie is easy as there is basically no connection between the two. I review the film on its own merits, which are many.The cast is great: Brad Pitt, Tilda Swinton, Elias Koteas, Cate Blanchett, Taraji P. Henson, and more. The script takes the concept of the short story and goes in completely different directions, taking a path that borders on overly sentimental. Benjamin is born at the end of World War I as an infant who is apparently about seventy years of age, nearly blind from cataracts. As he grows, becomes a toddler, then a pre-schooler, crippled with arthritis, frail, and elderly. He can only watch his peers at play through his glasses. As time passes, his health improves and he becomes more able. It becomes clear that he was born an old man but that he is getting younger as time goes by.Benjamin's mother dies giving birth and his father, horrified by the appearance of his son and by the death of his wife, at first considers throwing the infant in a canal (the movie is situated in New Orleans) but he ends up leaving the baby as a foundling at an old folks home where little Benjamin fits right in. He's taken in by Queenie, a black maid at the home, and her boyfriend or husband, who is the cook. Benjamin is raised as their own, with no mention ever being made of race. I really liked this although it's impossible to conceive of the reality of a race-blind New Orleans in the Twenties, Thirties, Forties, Fifties, and Sixties. Benjamin calls Queenie 'Momma,' and he's treated by all as her son.It's a heartwarming story from the time we meet Queenie, with age as the defining metaphor. In the old folks home, frail elderly come in, dead go out, and young Benjamin watches it all through the cataracted eyes of a pre-schooler, then a pre-teen, then a teen as the hormones kick in and hair starts to grow on his body. As befits the little old man that he appears, Benjamin is wise beyond his years, and we get a wizened view of life. I didn't really get any depth from the movie. It was a great story with great feeling, but no great lessons. And that's fine. It ran about two hours and forty-five minutes, and it held my attention throughout. It's well-written, with good characters, good dialogue, and good visuals.I highly recommend the short story, whether you've seen the movie or not. Neither will spoil the other as there are no plot similarities at all. The story is much more bitter-sweet than the film. I recommend all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's short stories. He was excellent. Many, maybe all, of his short stories deal with youth and the failure of its promise. The story of 'Benjamin Button' deals with it in reverse. The movie misses that entirely, as a Hollywood film must. The ending of the short story is one of the best I recall.",8,1,2,12 May 2012
Avatar," Good basic action film
","AvatarThis motion-capture film is directed by James Cameron. I saw it in 3D Imax, and I recommend that version for the effects. The plot is nothing special: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl.Our hero is Jake Sully, and he's a paraplegic whose twin brother died. His twin was scheduled to control an avatar on the planet Pandora, an avatar cued to his DNA. Since they were twins, Jake can take his place but hasn't had the training, so we get to watch Jake get all the stuff explained to him so we know what's going on. Obvious plot device. Generally, the planet Pandora has a mineral we want for commercial purposes, but the planet is inhabited by people who are connected physically and spiritually to the entire planet and its biosphere, and these people don't want us taking their stuff. Jake is sent to the planet's surface where he assumes the shape of a local inhabitant through the magic of science - he's an avatar with full mobility again. His goals are (a) get the inhabitants to agree to us taking the mineral and (b) failing that, discover how to destroy their home most effectively so we can take the mineral with least cost (in lives and money). Naturally, Jake falls in love and becomes one with the planet himself. He leads the aliens to a successful uprising against the hostile corporate take over.The plot has been compared to 'Pocahontas' and 'Dances with Wolves.' I'd guess that's fairly accurate. It's not a bad movie as movies go - good action, great effects. The bad guys are too cartoonish for my tastes, and the ending is deus ex machina, which I didn't like. However, the 3D Imax experience overwhelmed my sense of good film and gave me enough pleasure to like the movie.The effects people and the art and visual designers really knocked my socks off. One of the problems with computer-generated imagery and motion capture movies is the sterility of the 'sets' and the lack of grounding of the characters in the world they're supposed to be inhabiting. When real people walk the real ground, they affect the ground - when cartoon characters walk on the ground, there's no disturbance. 'Avatar' gets around this in part by having a world that is phosphorescent, so when the characters step on things, the things glow. In other scenes, however, the computer-generated characters float on the ground without interacting with it. There's no real feedback from the environment to the characters.The visuals were compelling - I got a little motion sick from some scenes, just as I would have in real life. The 3D camera work really works - I felt some of the objects were definitely in front of the movie screen - and Cameron didn't play it for cheap thrills. (They were very expensive thrills.) I think 'Avatar' is a major step forward in motion picture production, comparable to the coming of sound and color.There are, of course, problems. Motion capture means we see computer-generated characters. Whether you care about what is basically a cartoon is not something I can predict. I don't foresee motion capture as a wave of the future, but that may be a reflection of my generation rather than an accurate forecast. My habit has been to see and care about characters played by Jimmy Stewart, Humphrey Bogart, Morton Downey, Jr., George Clooney; Meryl Streep, Audrey Hepburn, Tilda Swinton, Ingrid Bergman.Additionally, the bad guys were so overdone they left me vaguely sick. There were no redeeming virtues - the bad guys were bad all the way through. We had no background that gave us reasons; we had no internal struggles with what would have been right. I'd contrast these cartoons with Heath Ledger's The Joker in 'The Dark Knight.' His character was fully developed, and we understood his evil and felt sorry for him. In 'Avatar,' Quaritch and Selfridge had no depth.Ultimately, the world Cameron created and the story worked for me. I think, though, that seeing it in 3D Imax made a significant difference from watching in 2D. I recommend seeing the film in 3D if at all possible. I think the 3D Imax effects cover up a lot of sins.NOTES ABOUT IDEOLOGY AND SOME American OBJECTIONS. SPOILERS.Some Americans see this movie as anti-American, anti-capitalism, and anti-religion. While I'll lend some credence to those points of view, they're overblown. I've read about pre-literate humans and their rituals for thanking the animals for sacrificing their lives so that the humans might eat them, and the aliens in 'Avatar' have this same ritual. I think having it here helps establish the world of the aliens and connects me to it: their world is the world of our Stone Age ancestors, where everything is connected and life is lived among creatures who have a right to exist. This is the basis for the objection to taking the minerals from the planet. It all has a right to exist. By casting the villain as corporation with military muscle, Cameron picked an obvious target. He did it badly, though, and that's my objection. It's possible to read the movie as a rant against the rape of our planet. It's possible to read the assault on a Stone Age populace as an attack on American military ventures in the Middle East. It's possible to see the exposition of the alien 'religion' as an attack on American monotheism. I though it was just a movie with good action and great special effects. It wasn't good enough for me to take seriously as a metaphor for anything. From my point of view, the people who were offended by the movie tell me more about themselves than they do about the movie. Your mileage will vary.",6,4,8,6 January 2010
The Artist," It didn't speak to me
","It's a silent movie in black and white. I'm perfectly willing to accept it on its own terms as silent; it didn't come across as a gimmick to me. And I take it as a black and white -- not gimmick there, either.Still, 'The Artist' didn't speak to me. I'm accustomed to watching silent movies, and I'm used to longer scenes, superbly composed camera shots of empty sets or of actors sitting silently as they muse. 'The Artist' seemed to me to be completely contemporary in its compositions and pacing. Where others see a paean to the lost art of silent film-making, I saw a contemporary movie that happened to be in black and white and silent. It quickly became apparent that 'The Artist' was a take off on 'A Star Is Born' with a tip of the fedora to 'Singin' in the Rain' -- which tipped me off it would have a happy ending. Sure enough, our hero, a star of the silent screen, laughs off the advent of talkies and becomes a has-been while the girl he meets and introduces to motion pictures becomes a talking sensation. I judge the movie to be about a half-hour too long, dragging us along as our hero sinks into oblivion, alcohol, and poverty, while the heroine becomes the talk of the country in talkies.There was one scene which I found riveting. In a sequence after he dismisses talkies, our hero is in his dressing room and rattles a glass. It's the first sound we hear from the movie. He's startled, and he makes noises among the objects on his dressing table as if the world in which he lived had been silent before but now there's sound. But he himself could not speak. We see him silently scream at his image in the mirror. Then he wakes up sweating from a dream. It was a fascinating thing to do -- to have sound effects without dialogue in a silent movie. I thought it dramatized his fears very well while commenting on the nature of silent movies by stepping outside the bounds of the screen.Unfortunately, the plot was obvious, the actors did not do anything I thought amazing with their silent roles, and the cinematography was too modern for my tastes. It was an interesting experiment, and I won't say it failed, but it did not bring me into their world as other movies have done.I recommend contrasting this movie with Fritz Lang's talkie 'M,' where Lang uses sound but has long stretches of utter silence as we watch the characters interact with each other and their world. 'M' has the best use of sound I can recall. Lang's 'Metropolis' is a silent film that I recommend for his brilliant compositions and lingering portraits of his actors. 'Metropolis' was released in 1927, the year 'The Artist' is set in at the beginning.",6,9,17,12 February 2012
The Fountain," A mystery: Why is the search for the Tree of Life called 'The Fountain'?
","Darren Aronofsky wrote the screenplay and directed this film. It's beautifully filmed, but a mishmash of a story. I believe the confusion arises because of a detail that is a spoiler, so I'll put that at the end. The trailer and advertising of the film market 'The Fountain' as science fiction, and that's dead wrong. It's an aching romance story hanging on a quest.Hugh Jackman plays Tomas, a doctor trying desperately to find a cure for cancer. His wife Isabel, played by Rachel Weisz, is suffering from the disease and has only a short time to live. She asks for more time with him and gives him a book she's written; he opens the handbound volume and begins to read as she sleeps.We are taken from the present to Ferdinand and Isabella and the quest for the discovery of the Tree of Life in the New World, inhabited by the precolumbian, prechristian 'natives,' and Tomas is now a conquistador, relentless and heartless in his search. Later we find ourselves in the far future, where Tomas still searches for the Tree of Life. Then we return to the present as Tomas plants a seed at his wife's grave.Much happens despite my short description. This may be a film of the magical realism genre (or maybe not - who can tell?) where Aronofsky created a reality in which desire and longing can change reality. The problem is that the film remains indecipherable at normal viewing levels, and we're left with an experience more like 2001: A Space Odyssey - we leave breathless over the experience but clueless over what it meant. It's a great looking movie, but it may not make a lot of sense. I'd compare it to Donnie Darko - Aranofsky left too much out. But here's where my suspicion comes into play.SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER In the opening scenes, we see Isabel ask for time with Tomas, and he's too busy. He gives her short shrift and sends her away so that he can continue his research. His research fails, of course, and Isabel dies. But that scene is shown three times, and in the repetitions, the rejection is softened, then eliminated. At the end, Tomas plants a seed at her grave that grows into a tree. The seed he plants, however, is not a seed but a dead husk. It's planted in the dead of winter. It cannot grow into a tree. My suspicion is that the film is Tomas's restructuring of his memory of his life. His search for a cure failed, he failed his wife by devoting nothing to her when she was dying, and Tomas is creating a fantasy where he spent his time where it would have done good - in loving care of his wife.The conquistador's search and the futurist's search for the saving tree of life are metaphors of course for the physician's search for a cure. The problem is that all three searches are doomed to failure. The search is for the benefit of the searcher, and Isabel is left to fend for herself. My final question is whether this ever sank in for Tomas, whether he realized his quest was better left undone, that Isabel should have mattered more. I think this is an issue broader than the movie, and if Aranofsky had been able to get this more front and center he would have had a great movie. When the quest becomes more important than the person, tragedy ensues.",Null,1,2,18 January 2010
The Reader," The Reader
","'The Reader' is about damage, betrayal of unimaginable breadth and depth, and the fantasy of undying love. David Kross plays Michael as a youth, Ralph Fiennes plays Michael as an adult, and Kate Winslet plays Hanna.NOTE: There are spoilers in this review. I've typed in an alert. If you haven't seen the movie, you may not want to read the spoilers.Michael's damage is shown in the very first scene, as the elder Michael deals rather poorly with a woman who has slept over. The damage is caused by the statutory rape of Michael, with his joyous consent, in the summer of 1958 when he was fifteen; he was the willing seductee of Hanna, a woman not quite old enough to be his mother. Young Michael glories in his sexual awakening, but as we see the damage in his later life, we understand that the effects go beyond Michael, wrecking the lives of everyone who loves him.It is good to see the movie treat the fifteen year old Michael as a fifteen year old: Michael has no understanding of Hanna and what is going on in the adult world. Hanna makes him cry, a perfectly fifteen year old response to his hurt bewilderment. Hanna keeps herself secret from Michael, begrudgingly telling him her name, calling him 'kid,' berating him for following her to her place of work. She moves from her apartment with no notice, and Michael has no way to find her. His first betrayal. The damage to the young Michael comes to the fore, and we see his inability to have a relationship with his family and with girls his age. As time goes by, we learn that Michael (still played by Kross) goes to law school in the Sixties, fails to relate to his classmates, and is in a seminar with advanced students. The indications are that Michael is quite intelligent, even among his law school classmates.As part of his seminar, his class sits in on a trial. The proceedings bring Michael to a shocking realization concerning Nazi Germany. It may have been that the people murdering the jews were ordinary people with ordinary lives, people who had families and were loved. If these were ordinary Germans who became monsters, their betrayal of morals, standards, and humanity far exceeds Hanna's betrayal of Michael. The quandary of how to understand family members who were loving parents at home and murderers and worse at work is beyond Michael's (and our) intellectual powers. These betrayals wreck Michael's life. We watch the older Michael, who has failed in his emotional life but succeeded as a lawyer, as he tries to rebuild his relationship with his daughter. Our last view of him shows Michael beginning for the first time to tell his daughter of his affair with Hanna and all that followed, and we have some hope that he can heal himself from his deep, terrible wounds.SPOILER SPOILER SPOILERAs part of his law school seminar, the class sits in on a trial of extermination camp guards, and Michael is shocked to find that one defendant is his Hanna. His shock turns to horror as he learns that her betrayal of him is nothing compared to the psychopathic betrayals she recounts in court as matter of factly as if she were deciding what to buy for lunch.During the trial, witnesses recount the horrors they suffered in Auschwitz and its work camps, where Hanna was a guard. Hanna's testimony leaves the viewer stumped as to whether she is borderline mentally incompetent or completely and utterly immoral. References are made to Germans knowing what was happening in the Jewish extermination camps and blindly ignoring it, so my guess is that the issue of her competence/immorality is a broader question: can we all be so willfully bind? So mute? And there is the deeper issue faced in Germany of dealing with a family member who was involved in the Holocaust. How could Michael (or anyone) have loved such a person, been blind to whatever was within Hanna (or any family member) that allowed her depraved behavior.Michael realizes from circumstances at the trial that Hanna is illiterate and ashamed of it. Rather than admit she cannot read and write, she falsely confesses to having written a report which places her in charge of the guards. Michael faces the question of bringing her illiteracy to her lawyer's knowledge, and he chooses to keep silent. When she alone of the six defendants receives a life sentence, Michael bears some responsibility for its severity. He has been mute, when he has information that could have lessened her sentence.Eventually Michael comes to terms with the reality of his fantasy love, and he begins to dictate books into a cassette recorder, which he mails to Hanna in her prison. I believe this is an attempt not to relive the happy past but to recapture a happier part of it; however, there is no redemption, not even any forgiveness. The attempt falls flat. As in the real world, there can be no forgiveness for the Holocaust. The Holocaust is irredeemably evil.His idealized love for the idealized woman is not merely shattered. His fantasy is blasted, dis-integrated, atomized. For Michael, the only recourse is to end the fantasy which has prevented his emotional growth as a person. At the end of the film, we see that Michael has accepted what happened and has decided to return to life however belatedly. At last Michael shoulders the responsibility for the heavy burden he placed on himself and others.This is an exceptional movie that deals with adult themes and problems in all their messiness, and there is no rainbow at the end. Not a happy ending, but an ending with promise. A promise absent not only from Michael's life for decades but from the lives of those who loved him.",8,0,2,3 July 2009
Inception," 'Inception' is a very good, _very_ fast-paced action movie.
","Directed by Christopher Nolan, 'Inception' has a brew of actors and action that kept me riveted to my seat for the entire movie. It was nice to see Joseph Gordon-Levitt all grown up from 'Third Rock from the Sun.' Tom Hardy stood out as one of the team (Eames); Cillian Murphy was well-cast as the perhaps weak-willed scion of a ruthless businessman father; I don't think I've seen Lukas Haas since 'Mars Attacks,' and he's cast here as a loser; Tom Berenger had a role as father-figure/mentor for Murphy's character; and Michael Caine had a small part as Dom Cobb's father with an unexplained British accent. And Cobb, of course, is played by Leonardo DiCaprio.I did not see the movie in iMax; I can't imagine what it would have looked like. The action was a thrill-a-second, gunfire and explosions all around the characters even when it was unnecessary, floating without gravity, fist fights, race car style driving in city streets, and much, much more. In my view, the special effects were excellent, keeping their place within the script, although losing 10 or 15 minutes of action would not have left me wanting more (run time as it is is 148 minutes).In the world of this movie, Cobb and a team of specialists can invade a person's mind through chemically-induced shared dreams and learn secrets from the victim. Cobb is hired to try to plant an idea instead of stealing them. In the dreams, of course, nothing is real and physics is (are?) violated on a whim. Cobb fundamentally has no control over either his victim's dreams or his own, which keep intruding.Overarching the whole shebang is Cobb's ongoing relationship with his dead wife, the well- named Mal (pronounced in the movie as if it were Moll). Ultimately, Cobb's intended victim and Cobb himself become so intertwined that both have to be saved from a state known as limbo, where the subconscious never awakes. Cobb can save the whole plot only if he saves himself. The depths and levels of subterfuge and game-playing is mind-twisting, but Nolan never loses his place, and neither to we. Very good script and direction to keep us all on track.I did get tired of Ariadne, whose only purpose seemed to be to voice the problems Cobb was going through and drive home to the audience how precarious Cobb's grasp of reality was. There were a few plot holes, as well, but nothing glaring - stuff was glossed over, everything Cobb's team needed was at hand, too many guys with automatic weapons miss our heroes only to be downed by one shot from a pistol - enough problems that keep me from giving it a better rating. My other misgiving is that Cobb's relationship with his late wife and his concepts of dream and reality were given short shrift in favor of action. At my age I wanted more of the backstory on why he was so in love with her and a better resolution of their relationship. C'est la vie. It's an action movie, after all.I give it a seven and a half on a scale of ten.",7,3,8,18 July 2010
Beowulf," CGI characters and sets well-used for the story
","Directed by Robert Zemeckis, this is a 'performance capture' film. It stars performances by Ray Winstone, Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich, Robin Wright Penn, Brendan Gleeson, and Crispin Glover. Oh, and Angelina Jolie. Performance capture, also known as motion capture, basically means the actors wear skin tight clothes with markers on them and act in front of a green screen. Later, computers render the performance digitally, with costumes, sets, and even the characters created by algorithms. For some people, this is a killer, and they can't accept the movie as a movie. I have some agreement with this. Wright Penn's character, Wealthow, was a blank for me. Whatever expression the actress gave the character, it never showed on the CGI face. Brendan Gleeson's Wiglaf, on the other hand, was totally credible throughout. But you must know that the sets, the costumes, the scenery, and the characters are all generated on computer and do not look photorealistic at all. My perspective was that I was watching a comic book playing out on the screen, with excellent illustrations and an actual story. In one scene, we see a dragon swimming underwater, breathing fire and making the water boil around its mouth - I thought this was excellent. The fantasy aspects of 'Beowulf' worked wonderfully. But when the characters talked, the motions and facial expressions weren't real, and often I had no feeling that the characters were walking on whatever surface they were supposed to be on. Overall, I was not so distracted from it to have it spoil the story for me. And 'Beowulf' certainly tells a story.Scriptwriters Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary took liberties with the original story, an ancient English heroic poem of uncertain date and origin. I've read a translation of the poem, and the movie does not follow it too closely, but the screenplay is epic in itself and worked well for me. Scholars may be disappointed, but movie goers will not be. This is an action drama, with enough emphasis on character, loss, flaw, and disappointment to keep the adults in attention.Because the movie is computer generated, the art aspects of the movie can really come to the fore. I did not feel ever that the performance capture aspects were used as tricks; Zemeckis kept the story in the forefront, with the animation as the servant of the story at all times. Both the old king (Hrothgar, played by Hopkins) and Beowulf (Winstone) had their flaws; no comic book (nor Old English, neither) heroes they. The artwork surrounding the characters was outstanding, in my very humble opinion, and added to the feel of the story.I am a great fan of illustration, and I saw the movie as excellent illustration with very credible plot and characters. It has great action, although some may find the gore a bit much in the battle scenes. Because the performances are in computer, I think the scenes are more realistic than live action battles, and this realism may be disturbing to those that are disturbed by such things - you know who you are.Glover performs as Grendel, and he gives a very interesting performance, taking Grendel far afield from the epic poem by making Grendel a touch more human than monster.A couple of notes: Beowulf and his kin are not being called 'geeks' in the movie; they are 'Geats,' natives of a no longer extant kingdom somewhere in Scandinavia. The most feared animals in Europe during the Dark Ages were bears. As was common among unschooled folk, it was considered bad luck even to say the word bear, so other terms were made up. In England, the common word was 'brown,' the color of the unnameable, which at the time was pronounced 'bruin.' In Scandinavia, bears were referred to as bee-wolves, a word combination having no meaning on its own now called a kenning. The Scandinavian spelling of bee-wolf was - you guessed it - Beowulf. So our hero is a bear, the most fearsome creature on the continent. The characters refer occasionally to their worship of Odin. Gaiman has written a novel called 'American Gods,' which has Odin as a central character. Other forms of Odin's name include Woden, Wotan, and surprisingly Mercury. Our day called Wednesday is a form of Woden's Day, the germanic form of the Latin Dies Mercurii, also known as mercredi in French and miercoles in Spanish, which use the latinate form. (Why we pronounce Wednesday 'wenzdi' is another question.) Additionally, Gaiman wrote 'The Sandman' series of comic books, which brings me back to the visualization of this movie as a comic book in action with most excellent illustration.",7,0,0,19 June 2012
Moonrise Kingdom," Meh.
","I guess my hopes were too high. I saw the previews and locked in on who the actors are: Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman, Harvey Keitel, Bob Balaban. How could the movie fail?And yet it does. Scripted by Wes Anderson and Roman Coppola and directed by Anderson, the movie is about a couple of 12-year-olds who run away together. Kara Hayward plays Suzzy and Jared Gilman plays Sam, and the actors are good. Sam's look of quandary was appropriate, and Suzzy was a vicious little delinquent -- which I liked. However, their story was muddled by all the back stories of the adults. There were a large number of kids in the Khaki Scouts who never really had a chance to let loose. And there was absolutely no ensemble acting among the grownups. Swinton and Keitel in particular were totally wasted in their brief roles. There was a great deal of promise, but it was never achieved. Wes Anderson is an A-list director with lots of quirky movies: Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, to name just three. Unfortunately, the story doesn't carry the actors. It's too scattershot, and too many of the characters were empty costumes. There were lots of laughs, a nod or two at other movies, but it left me empty at the end.",Null,20,37,30 June 2012
RED," Think 'Space Cowboys' for the CIA
","The conceit of this movie is that a group of retired ex-agents for the CIA can out-gun,out fight, and out-everything current employees, all without mussing Helen Mirren's coiffure. Think 'Space Cowboys' for the CIA.Overall, the movie works. The script by Jon and Eric Hoeber is excellent. Someone required that Bruce Willis's (age 55) love interest be a younger woman, so they cast Mary-Louise Parker (age 46), which is not as bad a stretch as I expected from Hollywood. 'RED' also stars Helen Mirren (65), Morgan Freeman (73), John Malkovich (57), Richard Dreyfuss (63), and Brian Cox (64), with a cameo by Ernest Borgnine (93). Karl Urban (28) played the poor current agent opposing all that goodness.This is definitely an action film for the Ensure set, but the action probably will work for all ages. It's way over the top. People are blown up non-gorily in towering infernos of flame and smoke. Our heroes never kill any good guys, although they will stoop to knocking them silly. Willis does his patented smirk, and Malkovich pretty much steals every scene he's in with a loony-tunes character that many actors would die for, but few could do.The gist of the plot is that a number of retired agents have been marked for termination with extreme prejudice, and Willis, Freeman, and Malkovich are on the list. Willis finds out the connection was an extraction in Guatemala, and he puts together the team of retirees (marked R.E.D. by the CIA - Retired, Extremely Dangerous). Parker gets pulled in because she knows Willis and happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The aging -- no, make that aged -- former agents kill the bad guys, blow things up, and generally have a whooping good time talking about the old days and how much tougher things were in their youth. I was worried about Mirren being able to pull it off as a killer with automatic weapons, but she handled it with graceful aplomb.The violence is so over the top it's cartoonish (think 'Home Alone' violence cranked up more decibels than you care to hear), and when our heroes are shot, it's touch and go for as long as the script needs to tug our heartstrings, then the next scene they're fully recovered and in another fight. Nothing is to be taken seriously, and the script is fast-paced and witty. Not a great movie, but a very good one.",7,2,3,18 October 2010
