First Man," Slow but good
","This movie was incredibly slow and long. It was also very loud. Earplugs recommended. Also it was very sad. A lot of death in this movie. Not sure how much of this story is true(the personal life of Armstrong)but overall, a good movie. Ryan Gosling is so overrated, but he did a good job. I recommend it and would see it again, with earplugs and tissues.",7,4,8,12 October 2018
A Star Is Born," Too much hype for a mediocre movie
","The trailers for this movie were very misleading. I thought it was going to be about how a famous country singer finds a girl and inspires her musically, challenging her, and falls in love in the process. The movie seems to be more about his demons and how she tries to help him while starting a challenging music career. The trailers looked like this was an inspirational movie. Honestly, one of the saddest movies I've seen in a while.Just a little forewarning: there is a lot of drinking, drug use, and cussing. Every other word was the f bomb. At least there was no nudity. Bedroom scenes were very brief. I really don't like Lady Gaga, but The acting was great and the music was incredible. Was the movie overall good? Yes...good, not great. This type of movie is just not my cup of tea. Another overrated movie to add the the list. Don't believe all the hype, it really wasn't that great.",7,2,5,22 October 2018
Ready Player One," Fabtabulous! Brilliant! Super awesome!
","When my husband dragged me to see this in theaters, I brought a book! I kept saying this movie would suck! It had me from the opening! My new favorite movie of all time! It used to be Ever After, but now I can't get enough of this movie! I loved everything about it! I have it on every night when I fall asleep. I wouldn't change a thing! It's weird that I love it so much since I hate everything about the 80s, but this is was AMAZING!!!! I highly recommend this movie!",10,0,1,22 August 2018
La La Land," Epic failure in bringing back amazing musicals
","Words I heard from so many people about this movie prior to seeing it was epic, spectacular, classic. I was so excited to see it and had such high expectations going into this film, especially since I just adore Emma Stone. I was sadly disappointed. I don't see what everyone else saw. I did enjoy some of the singing and dancing, also the desire to bring back the amazing and inspiring classics of original musicals. This was all just so epically wrong. Where do I even begin? The plot was not very inspiring, but kinda boring. The end was the worst ending to any movie of all time. I really wanted to not only like this movie, but love it. I just can't. It was meant to bring back the dead epic Hollywood musicals of Fred Astaire, but it was uninspiring and just altogether an epic failure for me. This movie made me cry, not Notebook cry, but like George Cloony playing Batman cry.",4,11,16,12 April 2017
The King," Disappointing
","Where do I begin? This movie was incredibly slow and boring, which is crazy since most of it involved battle. The lighting was terrible, the acting was only ok. There was a lot of fiction in this movie, that really didn't add any greatness to it at all, so it defeated the purpose and left us with this garbage. Don't waste your time.",5,4,11,16 November 2019
Black Panther," Snorfest
","I have tried watching this movie at least 10 times, a few times in the theatwrs and then at home now that we own it. Every single time, I fall asleep in the same spots. I wake up every time somewhere(always the same)then fall back asleep. I still have not seen this full movie beginning to end. I have admitted defeat and don't really have any interest in trying again. I don't understand how people credit this as the best Marvel movie ever....in my opinion, this movie is highly overrated, definitely the worst Marvel movie(including The Spiderman movies with Tobey Maguire, Fantastic Four kovies, and The Hulk movies), and just plain borning.",2,8,12,31 March 2019
