The Blair Witch Project," Just pure morbidity is what keeps us watching this
","This is an amateur film. It's simple. It's just like a documentary. When we watch this 'film', we feel a strange morbid curiosity on what's appearing on the screen, very similar to a voyeur's curiosity. I knew it was a fiction, but I tried to believe it was real (that's what it was supposedly made for, wasn't it?). Once I found myself believing what I was watching, I entered into the atmosphere, and this is what I found: morbidity, just that. Ah, and lots of boring minutes of footage, which will scare us only if we think that they are real footage images, where everything could happen as they are real.All in all, this is my conclusion: This isn't a horror movie, the same way that porno movies aren't erotic films. I could call this a 'hardcore horror film', and I find this idea pretty disturbing. I can't imagine what kind of films are to come in this line but with higher budgets. Perhaps a pseudo-snuff movie...? Too much for my sensibility.I gave it a 6 out of 10, and I still don't know why I didn't give it a 1.",6,0,2,31 October 1999
G.I. Jane," I liked it... that's all I can say
","It's disconcerting to see Demi Moore in such a different role in her career. You can't imagine the main actress from Ghost as an elite military corps member until you see her. But the fact is that she does it, and I must say I don't dislike her work at all. Of course, this isn't a film for every taste (it's not a pacifist movie...), but you'll enjoy it if you like the films in the line of First Blood or The Dirty Dozen. At this point I can even say that this film is better to me than First Blood in some sense (for example, its perspective isn't so epic, and the characters are more human). The only things I don't like are the continuous zoom effects in the last part of the film. I still don't know what they are supposed to be... But there's good acting, good tempo, appropriate music, and, why not, another good production from Ridley Scott with which you don't have time to get bored. I also must say that after having watched the film I don't feel like joining the elite forces at all :-), but anyway my rating is 7 out of 10.",7,1,3,16 August 1998
Unbreakable," Unbreakable broke my hope on Shyamalan
","It's been several months since I saw this film. Shyamalan's first work was really impressive to me. I even compared him with Stanley Kubrick. But now I must take that back. It was just an illusion. The Sixth Sense by itself is a masterpiece, but this second work from M.N.S. is horrible. This film is something like trying to make a work of art from a pile of trash. I never liked comics very much, I must confess, but this is too much for me. How can a comic be mixed with reality without stating (as Superman, Batman, etc. do) that it's just a comic, not reality? This film does a sort of trying to make us believe that comics are something real, in the same mood that Stargate tries to make us believe that there was a civilization from outer space in the Egyptians' time. This second premise is of course much more consistent and it's well developed.Technically, the film has no flaws. The cinematography is quite good, the music is acceptable (although not good), and the acting is correct (not good, either). But the idea behind the plot is simply impossible. In my opinion it's something unbelievable under any circumstances. And this second cameo from Shyamalan really annoyed me. Does he think he's Hitchcock...?
By the way, Mr. Shyamalan, what will be your next work? Trying to make us believe that Little Red Riding Hood was real...?4 or 5 out of 10",5,0,0,1 September 2001
Memento," A new concept: The first retroactive film in history.
","The best point about this film is that it's NEW. There isn't a single film in history (I think) with this structure. But, together with that original structure, we find a really good story (to be told backwards). One of the most interesting films I have ever seen. I don't know if the film can be used as a reference as I can't find any other situations to make more films with this structure. What's sure is that this is a film to be seen again and again (forwards and backwards).To see this film backwards, you have to start forwards with the black and white scenes until you reach the end, and then continue backwards with the color scenes.9 out of 10.",9,0,1,13 July 2001
The Others," Amenábar is a great director
",This is one of the best films of the year. Psychological horror at its best. No makeup or special effects are needed. The only shame is that I already knew the ending because there is a very similar one yet. But I love it despite of it. Amenábar is a great director (and also a great composer...!). There is very good acting and a solid plot. The ending scene is pure art. It reminds me Citizen Kane's final scene.I can't say anything else. I don't want to be a spoiler.7 or 8 out of 10.,8,0,0,11 September 2001
Insomnia," Finally I could see a good thriller
","Some days ago Woody Allen came to Spain to receive the prestigious Príncipe de Asturias Award, and he had time to express his personal opinion about Hollywood today. His recent film Hollywood Ending is a clear critic of what Hollywood has become. I have to say that I agree with him. Films are more and more expensive, but the results are worse and worse. It seems like there are no good writers yet, and films like The Red Dragon (which I saw today in its Spanish première) are -in my modest opinion, of course- a demonstration on how empty of ideas a film can be. But Insomnia is an exception among dozens of low quality films. It has a really good screenplay, with very good original ideas, and, also, the printed result is great. Al Pacino is splendid (does he overact a bit or is it just my imagination? Maybe it's only my imagination). Robin Williams is correct, he does his role well (it's his second bad guy role in just a few months) and the rest of the cast are also quite good. The opening scene is simply captivating. And the edition of the whole film is wonderful. It's a pleasure to see the first minutes of Pacino's scenes, full of short shots perfectly combined with plenty of subtle details. I enjoyed the whole film since it began until it ended. Nice story, perfect screenplay, solid acting, good music, wonderful cinematography and editing and good directing. A really good film. One of the best this year. 8-9 out of 10.",8,0,0,25 October 2002
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," One of the best Westerns of all time.
","This film is entertaining, funny and dramatic. It has everything I want to find in a movie, and thus I will say that it's one of the best Westerns ever made, in my opinion. The couple Redford-Newman is explosive, and here it's just outstanding. If you haven't seen this film yet, prepare everything before sitting in front of the screen, and consider yourself a lucky person to see this film for the very first time.My rating is 9 out of 10.",9,0,3,11 September 2000
Crash," A depiction of selfishness and altruism, or the eternal fight between Good and Evil
","OK, this movie covers the issue of racism and also about the American society, but there's something deeper in here.You can see both mechanisms of survival in the human being: the instinct of survival of the individual (egoism) and the instinct of survival of the species (altruism). They both are present in every human being, and they are 'transfered' from one human being to another in a 'contagious' manner. When somebody is under the control of selfishness, he is virtually a hero for himself, and a killer for everybody else. There you have Cameron, a non-violent Buddhist man whose life you get to find caught under selfishness, with no fear to be killed by a gun, maybe even wishing to be shot as a sign of compassion for himself, who's willing to stop his suffering after other people 'transfered' so many negative emotions to him that now that instinct is taking his life under control. And you can find that apparently hateful policeman, John Ryan, who abused a woman in the first minutes of the movie, saving later her life after a car accident, in this case, under the control of altruism, and acting as a hero, not for him, but for that woman. It's the perpetual fight of Good and Evil, depicted in a precise and understandable way. The policeman's father has a painful disease, and he transfers all his anger to his son day after day, who feels each day a little more helpless about a former compassionate person he truly loves. When we get to know that fact, we suddenly see him under a completely different point of view. The movie seems to tell us, 'you see? it's just a matter of knowledge', and we even understand his madness: as spectators, we don't catch his anger any more. Fear, anger, desire, attachment. You can see all negative emotions which, according to Buddhism, cause suffering to humans, which in turn makes our ego grow and veils our minds. Other movies, like Star Wars, show that 'force', and also how easy it is to fall into 'the dark side', but no movie showed before, without metaphors, and with so much detail, how human nature works.Suddenly, in the middle of madness, a combination of coincidences makes a miracle happen: a gun doesn't kill a little girl. That's a drop of Good which turns upside down a whole ocean of Evil, and shows that altruism, illusion, positive emotions... Good, in a nutshell, is our way to go, and also the strongest tool for survival provided by nature.And this latter 'miracle', and other scenes in the movie, like the one where Jean Cabot is angry and doesn't know why, and one minute later falls down the stairway, make me see this movie even in a deeper way. The Celestine Prophecy comes to my mind, with not just instincts involved, but the universal energy (something like 'qi' from Eastern philosophies) flowing among humans in the form of positive and negative energy, and a superior ego controlling each of our lives in every detail as a master puppeteer. Within this framework, that miracle wasn't just a coincidence: it was one part of a kaleidoscopic reality where universal energy forces coincidences to happen. In other words, the little girl, with her innocence and true love, made that possible through a change in what we know as reality. This concept is very close to Buddhist karma.Finally, this movie can also be interpreted from a scientific point of view in the form of the theory postulated by Richard Dawkins in his book 'The Selfish Gene'.In any case, it serves as a hard criticism of the actual selfishness present in the American capitalist society, 'preached' by Ayn Rand in her bestseller books, which have got to be almost as popular as the Bible, a line of thought that is spreading from the USA together with psychoanalysis to other countries like France and Argentina as a cancer in society. There are older movies which cover this issue in a metaphorical or allegorical way. One of my favorite ones is Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), remade in 1978.Crash is a great movie, worthy of the Oscars it got. Watch out, there are two movies with this name in 2004.",10,0,3,9 March 2011
Léon: The Professional," When a professional killer is a good person...
","This is one of those strange films where people who are supposed to be 'bad guys' are actually the 'good guys' in the story. Léon is a professional killer who can't do anything but kill. He's almost perfect when he works, but has one weak point: women and children. I don't know if such a character is possible in real life, and I'm not sure about the message of the film, if there's any, but the fact is that I find good acting, good music and a film with which you don't get bored. My rating is 7 out of 10.",7,2,5,10 October 1998
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Number 1 at the top 250 list...?
","I still can't believe that this film is at the very first position at the IMDb top movies list. This film has very good special effects, but it has (of course in my opinion) several weak points. Firstly, the music, which is a bit boring and very similar to Titanic's soundtrack at times. Secondly, there's a lot of stuff like 'Oh, this is the son of...', or 'I remember when I was at this or that place, which was marvelous and blah blah blah...'. This kind of lines in the script (something you don't know a priori but you have to accept although you haven't seen it with your own eyes) often gets me angry. Thirdly, this kind of movie can only fully satisfy people who like this kind of stories, and, unfortunately, I am not one of them. In any case, this movie MUSTN'T be above The godfather, Schindler's List, and even Star Wars. I can't believe that more than 30,000 people have voted an average of +9 points over 10. It's simply incredible. I am sure that this rating will go down a lot in the future. This ISN'T the best film of all time... let's be serious about this.My rating is 7-8 out of 10, of course trying to be objective, as I don't like this kind of stories, as I said before.",7,0,0,13 January 2002
Armageddon," When shall we watch a good asteroid movie?
","When I left the theater after having watched this film, I was... confused. I felt as if I had just drunk two litres of beer. I thought there should be no limit to the amount of action in a movie, but this one has TOO MUCH action, so much action that you have no time to understand what's happening. The situations are simply impossible, the errors appear when you don't expect them, and the plot can only be defined as horrible. I you want to feel like drinking alcohol tonight, then I recommend you watch this movie, the experience is pretty close to it. I you don't like alcohol or want to watch a good film, then it would be much better to rent The Godfather or Close Encounters of the Third Kind and watch it at home again.",6,0,1,13 August 1998
American Beauty," This is what I wanted Almodóvar to be...
","This film has humor, drama, suspense, sex, violence... and beauty. Imagine you take all the good ideas from the Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar and put them together making sense. The result could be pretty close to this film. The characters (unlike in Almodóvar's films) are realistic and credible, and the result is something wonderful. I liked his movie. My rating is 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,9 February 2000
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The best film made by Cameron
","Good acting, spectacular effects, action, suspense, emotions, funny moments, and... haven't I said it yet?, there's a story. This is in my opinion the best film ever made by the perfectionist James Cameron, in his most genuine line. In the screenplay there's something I don't easily find in films of this kind: a good beginning and -what's even more difficult- a good ending. My rating is 8 out of 10.",9,5,7,16 August 1998
Pearl Harbor," We need a change.
","I find this film one of the most difficult ones to comment. It has so many good points and so many bad points that you can think it's either a good or a bad film.But, to avoid that complexity, I'll try to recall them and write them down here, and let you construct your own conclusion. Of course, you have to keep in mind at every moment that this is the most expensive film ever made so far. So these are the points.1) The music. I place it at the first place because it is in my opinion the worst thing in the movie. This film needed a soundtrack by John Williams, for example. He would never have used that 'minor seventh' chord for almost all the scenes (including both love and war scenes), which makes the film so emotionally flat. In Gladiator we have a good example of what music can do to a film (not to mention Star Wars...).2) The script. Pearl Harbor has a really poor script, based on a simple and original idea but poorly developed. In Saving Private Ryan we have a simple and original idea brilliantly developed. The film is so predictable that 1 hour before its ending I already knew it (I think that even before that...). It's a paradox in a film which is based in a fact that's basically one of the biggest surprises in history. Well, you could say 'but history is already known', and you would be right, but the film isn't already known until you watch it. In Titanic I really was surprised when the ship collided...!3) The look. This film succeeds in creating another world for us. We feel transported to another time, with plenty of details, and that's something remarkable. The nurses look like fashion models, and Evelyn puts lipstick on her lips in every scene, but I'm not really sure if things were that way in 1941.4) The special effects. Pearl Harbor has one of the best special effects I have ever seen. The war scenes are so real that they can override all the bad points we could find. A lot of CGI has been used, but it's well done and looks real. As a result there is the best recreation ever made of what the Pearl Harbor attack could be. As in Saving Private Ryan, we find ourselves inside the battle and understand what those people should feel.5) The message. I know that films don't necessarily need a message, but this one needed one. And it really has one, but with a wrong envelope. In Saving Private Ryan, the old man at the cemetery asks his family if he is a good person. He has no physical injuries, but his soul is badly damaged, and desperately asks for a redemption to rip that black ghost away from him. We call this CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, and there's nothing of this in Pearl Harbor. Rafe and Danny kill a lot of people and pass through extreme situations, Evelyn lives the worst nightmare in her life, and after all of that we don't see any change in them. Most war films from the past (being most of them propaganda films) are the same way. That's NOT real, and doesn't help at all to send a message as we don't identify with the characters.You can make your own conclusions. This is mine: Film industry has lost its aim, which used to be art. They live for the moment, and don't care for anything but money. Nowadays a lot of good special effects are the perfect passport to success. All the other elements are chosen by its impact on masses rather than by its artistic value. And the artistic value is what really makes great films adored by masses, but in a long term.If you are curious about my rating to this film, here it is: 6-7/10.",7,0,0,9 July 2001
Independence Day," Oh, why...?
","Here is another super-high budget film, with lots of effects, and lots of everything. The resulting film is quite impressive in the action scenes, but... let me ask...Why...? Why did they have to include such a president (in the best Air Force One style) and not a more credible one...?Why...? Why did they have to include a drunken pilot instead of some other credible character...?Why...? Why did they choose Will Smith for such a role when he was still in people's mind as the funny Fresh Prince of Bel-Air...?Why...? Why a NASA candidate had to be living with an exotic dancer...?I could continue with many more questions, but I think you get the point.All in one question, I'd like to ask:Why do they spend so much money and do the hardest part of the film so well done and spoil the rest of it with so many strange items...?Is it perhaps that the writers didn't receive enough money to write a better screenplay...? Sincerely, I can't believe it. And nowadays there are lots of films in this same style, I mean, with lots of money spent in the technical aspects of the film and horrible screenplay and/or actors.Is it perhaps that they knew that people would like the result? Is it perhaps that I'm wrong and most people really like that trash...?Or is it perhaps that they thought that the film was too horrifying that they had to include comic elements to make it a lighter horror film...?Maybe there is no explanation at all, but in any case I think they failed in their intentions whatever they were.5-6 out of 10 (just for the effects).",7,4,8,29 May 2001
Saving Private Ryan," An excellent war movie, among the best
","This is probably one of the best war films ever created. The sound is incredible, the images are sensational, and the acting is very good. It maintains a high level in all its other aspects. The first 5 minutes of battle are just what I expected. There are many original points not present in most war films, and there are even funny points in the dialogue. Ah, one more thing... I also must say that perhaps I made a 'mistake' before going to the theatre: I read the user comments at the IMDb... In them, people say things like 'it's the best war film in history', or 'I'm not the same after watching this movie'. Well, I must admit it's a great war movie, but nothing else, at least for me. Of course, it's not the best film ever created. Anyway, you shouldn't miss it. My rating is 8 out of 10.",9,0,0,18 September 1998
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Disappointing. It's not the Spielberg I know.
","When I went to see this film, I said to myself: 'If the first part was good, then this one will be terrific...' I prepared to see the sequel of Jurassic Park, but what I saw was just several more dinosaurs with no plot and no message. Perhaps if we prepare to only see two hours of special effects, then we can even enjoy it, but the fact is that the first time I saw it on the big screen I left the theatre saying to myself: 'What a bad movie...!'. There are so many bad things in it (the 'feather weight' T-Rex that Ian can carry in his arms as if it was made of plastic, the acrobatic abilities of Ian's daughter, a horrible tempo, the impossible characters and their lack of development... Spielberg should never have made this film. It's a negative point in his career, and money isn't everything when you're a genius. My rating is 5-6 out of 10.",Null,0,1,20 September 1998
Schindler's List," A beautiful film about the holocaust horror
","Undoubtedly, this is a masterpiece, one of the most recent ones created in cinema history. Can a movie about the holocaust be beautiful? Of course it can, and here we have an example. We have more than three hours of poetry about the human nature, about love, about hate, about madness, about egoism, about altruism, all of them mixed to produce the human being as what it really is. It's a film that cleans our soul, makes us feel like humans, and makes us understand a little bit better the aim of the Human Race. John Williams gave the most beautiful sound-track he ever created to set the emotional background this film needed.",10,142,268,6 August 1998
2001: A Space Odyssey," An epic odyssey of sensibility
","2001: A Space Odyssey... its only title brings undescriptable feelings to our minds. A film 20 years ahead of its time, where music and images form a perfect work of art. We're so lucky that Kubrick made the correct decision with the musical choice. Perhaps the original soundtrack composed specifically for the film was a great soundtrack (probably it was), but in the 'spatial dance' scene I can't imagine anything else but the Blue Danube. The result is an epic dance where the dancers are two pieces of human technology, with the Universe as the dance room and silence as the only witness.It's one of the few films I have seen that enhances the book on which it is based. The dialogue almost doesn't exist in this film, and also in this aspect we find that Kubrick made the perfect choice. Words aren't necessary when Nature talks with its own language. Even in the dialogue scenes the images take precedence over them, making the dialogue just a collateral element. As a conclusion, I must say that only a genius could make a film like this one. Kubrick is one of the few 20th century geniuses, together with Einstein, Rachmaninov, Picasso, Orson Welles...",9,0,2,15 April 1999
Singin' in the Rain," This is what I call a classic!
","This is one of the best movies of all time, and possibly the best musical ever made. Prepare to enjoy the music, the gags, the story, the colors, the romance...I won't say much more about this classic. I guess everything has been said yet.9-10 out of 10.",9,2,5,11 September 2000
Total Recall," An unforgetable film
","This is in my opinion one of the best Sci-Fi movies of all time. The story, the screenplay, the music and the acting are really brilliant (Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sharon Stone do their best), the special effects are very good, and the film as a whole entity is unforgetable. A Total Recall is what they don't want the main character to have, and a Total Recall is what comes to your mind when the end of the film arrives, and only then is when you understand what the script made you forget at the beginning. A film to be seen twice at least. My rating is 8-9 out of 10.",9,1,3,13 September 1998
Shrek," Great entertainment
","This is one of the most entertaining films I have seen this year, if not the most. The landscapes, scenarios and characters are wonderful. The plot is a bit (more than a bit) predictable, but all the other aspects are excellent and the result is a good film. The renderings are at times even better than A Bug's Life's. Some shots really look like they are real. Of course there's a lot to do yet with CG animation. One example is the full-body animations of the characters. The donkey moves pretty well (although not perfectly), but the rest of the characters aren't natural at all. The close-ups are simply unbelievable, anyway.I recommend you watch this film. It's funny and entertaining, and the computer graphics are fantastic.8 out of 10.",8,0,0,19 July 2001
The Sixth Sense," One of the best horror films of all time, and an allegory of alienation
","Last week, when I left the theater after watching this film, I had the strange impression that I had just watched something great. Today, one week later, I'm still convinced that I was right.When the Horror genre seemed to be poured out into mediocrity with films such as Blair Witch Project or The Haunting, a new one has just appeared which with no doubt deserves one of the highest places at the all-time horror movies top list.Nowadays it's very difficult to surprise people with a horror movie, or simply to scare people. Everything seems to have been said and done yet. But The Sixth Sense really does both things, so we wonder, where is the secret of The Sixth Sense, if there is any? To find it out we can start by analyzing some of its aspects. Firstly, Bruce Willis does one of the best performances in his whole career (if not the best); Secondly Haley Joel Osment does an Oscar-deserving performance as the boy Cole; thirdly, the secondary actors are close to perfection; fourthly, the screenplay is one of the most imaginative ones we have seen since lots of years ago, with the best ending I could ever have imagined; and finally the music and the sound effects are really impressive, raising the stressing moments to the highest level.Until now, what we have seen is plenty of good points, excellence in all the film details, but not the real secret. The real secret is (and only can be) something present in every aspect of the movie and at the same time independent from each other. What I mean is the DIRECTING. I certainly could write a thousand lines about the directing of this movie, about its structure, about its developing, about the visuals, about the ideas we could extract, but the only thing I will say about it is: Stanley Kubrick is born again! Shymalan has just become a new star in the movie sky, a new director and writer to add to my all-time top ten list. In fact, when I went to see The Matrix, what I expected and didn't get was something like this, and now I'm so glad that Cinema has finally given it to me. Thank you very much, Mr. Shymalan.This film can also be viewed from another perspective: it also shows how some people are not able to see that they are emotionally dead. There's a lot of people in the USA and also in other countries who only see what they want to see, just like in the song Nowhere Man, by The Beatles. The psychiatrist was trying to cure the boy, and he didn't realize that it was *his* problem. Sigmund Freud suffered that kind of problem, and now his teachings are extended all over the USA and other countries like France and Argentina.",10,0,1,28 January 2000
The Matrix," It's not what I expected (too COOL for me...)
","I expected to see a very special film, ranked #20 at the IMDb Top 250. I thought I'd have something like a stunning experience... but I was wrong. What they didn't tell me is that The Matrix is just a manga film aimed to the young public. Perhaps 10-15 years ago (when I was 15-20 years old) I would have enjoyed these almost two hours and twenty minutes of audiovisual events, but now it's not the case. Many people have discovered what they thought to be a new idea in cinema. Well... unfortunately, it's not new. And the way the story develops itself is out of place for me. What I mean is that it's not a film for older people, as it enhances all the elements of children's play and all those FANCY things young people like (the COOL music, the COOL glasses, the COOL walking style, the COOL guy, the hyper-blast finale that reminds me an episode of Mazinger Z...), and just assumes everything as the way things have to be. There are no adult references, just a show where adolescents' dreams come true. Nothing really intellectually moving.Don't let me be misunderstood, it's not a bad film, but it's not enough for me, at least to be at the 20th position in the list.
There are good visual effects, and there is good sound. I didn't get bored. But it's just another film, not the one. Crying Freeman has less effects but is better for me. 7 out of 10.",7,1,2,25 June 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A really great Sci-Fi movie
","This is one of the greatest Sci-Fi films ever made. I have seen it so many times that I can remember every detail and every word in the screenplay, and I'm sure there are lots of people who can do the same. But the best experience is when you watch it for the very first time. Then is when you really feel the magic inside this fantastic masterpiece of the SF genre. The scenes I like best are the opening scene with the background planet covering the screen all the way long, the scene of Luke thinking and watching the suns of his home planet as the evening falls and as a wonderful music shows his feelings, and the battle just after the 'escape' from the Death Star. The only not so good thing I can say about Star Wars is... Mark Hamill. He's the main actor and looks like he's the secondary. Perhaps Harrison Ford isn't so mature as in his later works, but he's brilliant anyway.",8,1,2,2 August 1998

Fantastic Four," Very good film recreation of a comic !
","I knew what I was going to see when I went to the theater several weeks ago. And it didn't disappoint me at all. Unlike Shyamalan's Unbreakable, this film assumes that it's just a comic and everything happens like it does in them. The spirit of the comic was very well captured, the special effects are pretty good, and the film as a whole is entertaining. The ending is perfect for a sequel: It lets you waiting for the next one. I'm sure there will be Fantastic Four II, III, IV and even more.I'm not a comic fan, but I liked this movie. More than Batman Begins (2005) although less than Superman.",7,1,3,30 July 2005
Gladiator," I was disappointed
","I heard and read that this film is a classic, and thus I expected a really great film. But it's not the case. This film has a serious lack of character development despite it lasts 2 and a half hours. Together with the character development, we can see a poor ambient development. We just see a huge coliseum and thousands of people computer-generated. Just that. We don't see closeups, we can't see the feelings involved, and we feel no empathy at all (for a good example of a well done job, see Kubrick´s Spartacus). The camera moves in the fight scenes are acceptable for films like Saving Private Ryan, set in a time where cameras did exist, but not for a Romans' film... They just seem to be used to make us more difficult to find goofs, and that is a dirty trick in a so expensive movie. Another point is the acting. The actors are not bad, but they don't look like people from the 2nd century. OK, nobody knows how they were, but I am sure they weren't like people from the 20th century. I mean, the dialogue, the way they move, the feelings they show. You can use the same acting and the same music in a film set in the Middle Ages and we wouldn't note the change. If we forget that Ridley Scott is the director and Steven Spielberg is the man behind the production company, we just have a mediocre film. I still can't believe that The Sixth Sense got no oscars and American Beauty took them all. Mr. Spielberg, you are rich enough yet, so please let talented people do their thing and stop your 'This is the greatest film ever' propaganda in a Microsoft style! And you, people, please look with your own eyes and don't follow the stream. Dreamworks is making really good products, but not everything is gold...",7,0,0,20 May 2000
Back to the Future," A masterpiece
","I have seen this film dozens of times, and I always end up watching it from its beginning until its end without a single eye flick. This film is absolutely marvelous, and Michael J. Fox is perfect for the role he plays. There aren't many films which don't let you get up from your seat until the credits are scrolling, and this is one of them. It's incredibly funny and entertaining, so much that it creates addiction.My conclusion is that this film is nothing but a work of art. Although it's in a key of comedy, it reaches the excellence necessary to be a masterpiece. It's very difficult for a comedy to reach that point. The Odd Couple and The Sting are another two examples.My rating: 10 out of 10.",9,0,1,8 December 2000
