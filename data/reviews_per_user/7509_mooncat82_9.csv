Requiem for a Dream," Almost a religious experience
","I have actually watched this film several times now.  I am disapointed that it was so rudely passed over by the oscars..I thought Ellen Burstyn deserved the acadamy award for this, and can't believe it was given to Julia Roberts for Erin Brockovitch instead!!  Admittedly, the film is dark, even depressing..but it gets under your skin.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to see a great performance, and a seriously thought provoking film of innocence inadvertantly surrendered to drugs.",8,0,1,25 December 2001
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Only as good as Johnny Depp
","Caught this film last week and have to say I didn't think it was the greatest thing since sliced bread, but Johnny Depp and his over the top campy performance delighted me.  It was worth seeing just because of him.  I like that Depp chooses unusual, frequently non mainstream films, I think he is a decent actor.  His facial expressions in this movie were priceless and I giggled through much of it.  My suggestion..wait for it to come to cable tv, but enjoy it when ya want to just relax and have a little fun.",5,1,2,29 August 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Incredibly well done!
","I know it didn't follow the book word for word..but of all the Lord of the Rings movies, it was absolutely my favorite.  Visually it was fantastic. There were a few flaws, but they were absolutely forgivable.  I have no complaint and will see it again.  It was 'love at first sight'",9,0,0,25 December 2001
American Beauty," No winner
","I finally saw American Beauty the other night. I like to see all the oscar nominees.  I was really stunned that this movie was nominated for an academy award. The movie got off to a slow beginning. The characters were incredibly dislikable. The issues were cliche, and I think if the overall message was supposed to have been 'there is beauty all around us, even within all this ugliness', that it was so subtle as to be practically insignificant. The movie simply wasn't beautiful enough for me to pull it out of all the ugliness. I found it disturbing, with little depth. If these people are 'modern archetypes', then please just kill me now because I sure wouldn't want to be living in their neighborhood, I don't think I do, nor any of the rest of us..at least I hope not!  I have never been so stringently opposed to a particular movie winning the oscar in my life.  This was one of the least uplifting films I have ever seen..my feeling..just not that many good movies made this year and American Beauty is one of them. It is elevated to a status it doesn't deserve. It frightens me a little that people seem to identify with it so strongly..are we really such an angst filled people? I found it depressing and ultimately disapointing.",5,0,0,27 February 2000
Being John Malkovich," clever surrealism
","Being John Malkovich was a clever somewhat sophisticated film that kept me interested. It is most decidedly quite offbeat, a Salvadore Dali meets Monty Python kinda movie. I didn't find it particularly hilarious, but humorous and very well acted. I didn't even recognize Cameron Diaz in the role of Lotte and was surprised as I could be that it was her. John Malkovich himself completely stole the show, he was absolutely charming and brilliant. I found it a fun movie, but would not recommend it to everyone. If you like a far out concept that toys with the absurd, this is a good movie for you.",5,2,4,28 February 2000
The Sixth Sense," Surprisingly good
","I didn't expect The Sixth Sense to be nominated for an oscar, since horror is so often overlooked, and since Hitchcock is gone, there just aren't that many good horror movies around anymore.  This film surprised me. I was glued to my seat through the whole thing. Not normally a big Bruce Willis fan, I thought he did a great job. Now I don't know that I would have chosen it for an Oscar, but when I discovered it was nominated, I got a small tingle of satisfaction that it made it. This was a clever movie, suspenseful, perplexing at times, but all coming together in the end in a flash of insight.  I enjoyed it completely and recommend it to anyone who loves a good ghost story.",10,0,0,27 February 2000
The Matrix," Awsome sci fi
","The Matrix might be the best science fiction film I have ever seen. The story was a provocative exploration of reality that kept me riveted to the screen with never a dull moment. It was cleverly executed with wonderous special effects that weren't just a light show, not just dazzle, but a spectacular addition to a world of incomprehensible impossibility. The acting was only so so, but the storyline itself was so cool that even average acting couldn't subract anything from the winning formula. It was action packed and entertaining beyond most science fiction films out there today. I am sure all the sci fi heads have seen it already, but, I would recommend this film to anyone seeking adventure. If you love a roller coaster, you will love The Matrix..have fun!  Wheeeeee",9,0,0,28 February 2000
Donnie Darko," New Cult Movie
","The first time I saw Donnie Darko, I came away feeling perplexed and creeped out. I liked it, but just didn't get it. Now I have seen it five times. I absolutely love this film. I am not a teenager, I am a forty something bonafide movie freak.  When people ask me, what is the movie about, I say, it's about an adolescent boy that is visited by a demonic looking giant bunny, it's about time travel, it's about the many paths that we travel in our lifetimes and it's about the consequences of our choices.  This movie touches something very personal in me. This is not just a 'teen fluff' film. It is haunting and thought provoking. The music is appropriately haunting as well. It is wonderfully cast and the acting is impeccable. As a rule, I don't buy movies, but I will buy this one. Even the cinematography is wonderful, the slow motion and backward shots. This is not a film for young kids. I think the bunny would scare them senseless because it is surely terrifying to look at. I am surprised the film is just now receiving so much attention, but I know it's because it is on cable all the time, I guess it was a sleeper at the box office. This is one of the most provocative and interesting films I have seen in a very long time, but I suggest you watch it more than once because it isn't an easy concept to grasp, and it would be easy to dismiss it as inconsequential. I think Donnie Darko is quickly becoming the new cult movie of our time, and am of the opinion, it deserves that distinction.",9,0,0,29 August 2003
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Laughed out loud at George
","This wasn't the best film I ever saw, but there were components to it, that I enjoyed completely.  The soundtrack is most excellent, especially for those of us who are lovers of traditional and bluegrass music.  George Clooney was the funniest..many of the scenes cracked me up.  It was a compelling, light hearted rendition of the Odessey..Much fun was had by all.",7,3,3,25 December 2001
