The Hangover," Hilarious
","This movie is hilarious!I don't think much more needs to be said about this movie other than just repeating that The Hangover is a really hilarious movie experience to enjoy.Watch it with friends and you will laugh non stop. I guarantee you will, it's so funny.If I try to get specific about any of the plot it will just ruin the fun for you, because so much of this movie is about the surprises that pop up and the unraveling of the mystery of where these guys lost their friend while they were drunk.Zach Galifianakis is incredibly funny in this and every joke in the movie is great!Not the best movie ever but for pure laugh value it is a really hilarious movie.",8,1,2,3 March 2014
