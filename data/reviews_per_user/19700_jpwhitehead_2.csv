Black Swan," you should already know what this movie is about
","It was visceral, truncated, reminded a lot of Harold and Maude; please don't ask me why. The film flew about the topics of awareness and psychological and professional adventitiousness but it did not dwell for too long. I saw 'Nina' as having an exacerbated and untreated DID (disassociated identity disorder) or what we used to call an MP (multiple personality). But then again, maybe not; maybe its all exegesis. The film was brilliant and my first Aronofsky for the most part. I realize the budget was low but I lost a little in the digital image. The sound for the film made it up in a big way. I enjoyed the film on a gut level and the characters became like caricatures in a certain respect which I attribute to the image and screenplay. As far as being a psychological drama, it didn't really offend my sense of people with mental illness. In conclusion I applaud Aronofsky for not hamming up the titles which follow people with mental illness their entire lives, the subtlety was necessary and appreciated. It screened like a dream to me, albeit a nightmare, but a well wrought stripped down visceral dream.",9,3,7,2 January 2011
Alice in Wonderland," a great film for children
","I know there are many reasons I liked this film. Linguistically it was just shy of genius but I think Lewis Carroll had something to do with that. No, no it was that this was the first film I had seen in a long time that expanded the concept of mental illness to children in a friendly way.It had me laughing when no one else was! It was beautiful and not impossible to guess what Burton was getting at visually. Just a beautiful, brilliant film. 9 stars... It has been a rarity for mental illness to be portrayed to youngsters. we simply haven't known how to do it. Lewis Carroll did with his book but it almost seems to me with less confrontation. The actors and actresses were wild looking. The redemptive advice Alice gives to her aunt about dispelling delusion was classic. This is something I have been waiting for, now about trying The Phantom Tollbooth.",9,4,13,5 March 2010
