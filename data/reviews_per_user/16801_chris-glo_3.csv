Casablanca," Bergman & Bogart - a Fantastic Pair!
","I have always adored Ingrid Bergman. This woman could say more with her eyes than any other actress ever filmed. I have seen just about every single Ingrid Bergman film and have never been disappointed. And Bogie? There never has been or ever will be another like him. His performances will always stand out, no matter how many years pass. Another outstanding performance in this film is by Paul Henreid, who plays Victor Lazlo, an underground hero and bane to the Nazis. There is a part in this film that always overwhelms me. At Rick's place, the Nazi soldiers have all gathered and start singing their 'National Anthem' much to the chagrin of the rest of the customers, who are mostly French. France has already fallen and is occupied by the Germans, so these people are very downhearted at hearing this Anthem being sung. At that point, Lazlo (Henreid) walks over to the band and demands that they play 'La Marseillaise', and they do, causing everyone to stand and sing, showing their allegiance to France. The German singers are then drowned out by the French. It is overwhelming and is like a look into the future of the war and Hitler's ultimate defeat. If you want to see a war film, without the blood and guts, but with fine, intelligent and outstanding performances, look no further than 'CASABLANCA'.",10,1,2,4 April 2005
Ben-Hur," One of the finest movies of all time!
","What do you say about a film that has everything? In my opinion it is THE finest Biblical epic ever made. Charleton Heston as Judah Ben-Hur is one of the greatest performances ever filmed. He WAS Judah - and all of his co-stars (Stephen Boyd, Jack Hawkins, Martha Scott, etc...) they WERE who they portrayed. The musical score was absolutely Miklos Rosza's finest. Never before in any film I have seen was so much feeling conveyed with the music. It was fabulous the way the Jesus' life was intertwined with Judah's. This film gives everything that should be given; If you are a religious person, it fulfills and affirms everything that you believe. If you are not, it still gives you a glimpse of Jesus's life, his teachings and how hate can turn into love by faith and example. I have seen this film at least 30 times and it still never fails to move me keep my attention. So, what really is the greatest film of all time? Gone With The Wind? Citizen Kane? There are others but don't decide until you have seen this one. It will touch your heart and soul forever.",10,2,5,4 April 2005
Munich," Still waiting to be 'entertained' by a Spielberg Film
","OK- I was nervous about watching this film because ever since approx. 1993 Mr. Spielberg has been in this 'tell the story as graphically as you can' mode. Grant you, Schindler's List is outstanding - it told a very sad story and very graphically. The trouble with producers/directors today is they have all forgotten the key to successful entertaining: you have to be an ordinary person who knows what ordinary people like to see. Now which do you suppose is the most entertaining war film: something like Sergeant York or Saving Pvt Ryan??? Saving Private Ryan was a great film but left me feeling so overwhelmingly sad, I could not watch it again. Sergeant York (w/Gary Cooper, re: WWI) is a film that anyone can watch over and over again because it leaves you feeling proud and happy. To all of today's directors and producers I say this: Life is very complicated in this day and age. I truly believe more people want to watch something to help them ESCAPE from real life and/or make them feel proud and happy when they leave the theater. PLEASE STOP with the true-to-life extremely graphic crap. Also - what exactly was the purpose of the sex scenes?? What extremely poor taste to include the sex with a pregnant woman scene! It had nothing to offer the story. Did this film entertain me and leave me happy?? NO - but it did further my disgust with all of the violence which already overwhelms this world. I fear this is the last Spielberg film I will venture to see.",6,0,3,18 September 2006
