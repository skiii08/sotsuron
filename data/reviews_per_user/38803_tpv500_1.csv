Requiem for a Dream," Beautifully gritty, Powerful, Trance-like, Substantive
","What a treat for folks who want some meat on their movies! You'll get sucked into the characters' worlds immediately and feel their pain-- just like you used to before pre-fab, one-size-fits-all film scripts became the norm. While the plot itself is no surprise, watching Burstyn will consume you. A spectacularly directed, photographed and edited film. Even the sound editing is something special. After you've seen the movie, check the web site, which is as different as the film itself.",9,1,1,22 October 2000
