The Incredible Hulk," An Enjoyable Yet Unfulfilling Blockbuster
","The Incredible Hulk is positively jam packed full of action and excitement. It contains impressive CGI visuals, a malevolent & power hungry adversary and scenes which will have you on the edge of your seat. But unfortunately this is not enough.The Incredible Hulk is a film which isn't terribly diverse. It seems to only switch between the fugitive lifestyle of the protagonist & some sort of conflict; where he is being either being pursued, or engaged in a fight whilst in Hulk form. It didn't seem to branch out enough from a linear form, nor did the pace of the film crescendo.The acting however is well done. Edward Norton plays the worn out but nonetheless strong and enduring Bruce Banner in a convincing manner. As dos William Hurt in playing the emotionally detached military General.Whilst The Incredible Hulk (2008) is in no way a continuation or sequel to the movie Hulk (2003)... It's hard not to compare the two in order to decipher which one has the most potential.'Hulk' has a much more cartoony style in it, which i found much more engaging. In contrast, 'The Incredible Hulk' decided to follow a more darker and gritty style. The comparison is similar to comparing Batman Begins with the older Batman movies. You can't help but ask 'Is a guy who turns into a green, muscular beast when he gets angry really something that's meant to be taken seriously?' Overall the movie is good for some thrills, decent acting & impressive eye candy... But not much more.",7,5,8,18 June 2008
