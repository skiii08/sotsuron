Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Another great destined to become classic
","George Lucas' intention was to make movies akin to the Saturday matinee; I believe he has more than accomplished this.  The latest movie is a departure from the previous three being that it is geared more to the younger crowd. I saw this movie the first time with my wife and I enjoyed it. I saw it the second time with my children and I loved it right along with them.  I have taken my kids a third time and I enjoyed it more than ever.  This movie has really encouraged my kids to get excited about science and engineering. Both are trying to figure out how they can construct their own Pod Racer. There are many movies that can have a negative impact upon our children; this one has had a profound positive impact.  Although the critics may not have liked it, the effect upon my children confirms that this will become another all-time classic.",10,0,0,19 July 1999
