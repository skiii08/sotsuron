50 First Dates," Great Beginning and Ending, Boring Middle
","The Latest from Adam Sandler is no Punch Drunk Love, but it's better than Happy Gilmore and is in the same vein as The Wedding Singer. In similar fasion to the latter, this movie stars Drew Barrymore as Sander's love interest, with a slight twist in the state of her character's short term memory.This film has some great interaction between the two characters in their first few scenes, but eventually it disintegrates into predictable slop. I nearly fell asleep.
** MINOR SPOILER ALERT **
However, the ending of this movie redeemed much of its value. Instead of some magical resolution where Barrymore's character regains her memory ability and they live happily ever after, Sandler's character makes the decision to stay with his love even though her condition remains the same. That spoke volumes to me regarding true love... something that his former movies lacked even with a love story.",7,0,0,13 February 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," It's Star Wars, and it does just about everything right...
","To keep this review short and sweet, it's Star Wars, and it does just about everything right. While sometimes I feel odd because I really enjoyed The Phantom Menace, I will say wholeheartedly that this movie surpasses Menace in many ways.There are a few shortcomings in Clones, as the story hits a few bumps in the road on an otherwise steady course of action and solid dialogue. There are a few scenes where the CGI is slap-you-in-the-face obvious, but for the most part it blends wonderfully with the live action and actors.One thing that will be hard for people to do is compare this movie to the original Trilogy, which is something I think is not fair. These last two movies (and the one to come) have a very different feel, pacing, and obviously a different style of action. This is not your older brothers Star Wars, but it's still a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.",9,0,0,16 May 2002
Van Helsing," It's fun, but not perfect.
","This kind of movie is not intended to be taken too seriously, but what it does intend to do, it does well. Action, adventure, a little comedy and even a splash of romance round out this film.It's too dark for the kids, but if you're not afraid of heights, you'll get a cheap thrill out of all the swinging, falling, and flying. If they haven't already, I imagine Disney will make a Van Helsing ride. I'd pay!The CG is well done, but not perfect. I think the subject matter makes that forgivable, however. I already know it's a fantasy, and as long as you choose to get into the movie, you won't mind at all.",9,0,0,15 May 2004
The Wedding Singer," Adam Sandlers actually demonstrates multi-dimensional acting abilities!
","This is the first Sandler movie I've seen where he actually demonstrates acting skills! It is just as funny as his other works, but I can actually stand to watch this more than twice. His other films lose their punch after watching them more than twice, but The Wedding Singer has enough depth to enjoy multiple times.",9,1,1,2 March 2000
