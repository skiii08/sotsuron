Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," a nauseating muddy mixed up mess
","The film is a nauseating mixed up muddy mess, from beginning to end. Incredibly gimmicky and shallow. Nearly unintelligible dialogue. The gimmickry present reminds one of how the works of Arthur Conan Doyle should *not* be turned into CSI, Batman, or James Bond. And sadly other recent works within the 'Sherlock franchise' fall prey to this evil temptation (eg: the BBC's recent Sherlock series). Save your brain. Save your money. Keep your lunch in your stomach. Avoid this film. Instead seek out works with Jeremy Brett. Other portrayals by Robert Downey Jr., even by Benedict Cumbersplatch / Smebersmoch / Hoobersmich / Cumberbatch, are rather akin to shallow harlotry in my view. Mostly unconvinced. Forced. Contrived. Gimmicky. But Jeremy Brett's portrays were near perfect. So search for them instead.",1,5,10,11 November 2014
Gravity," Boring. Pedantic. 5 minutes worth of 'real material.'
","Incredibly boring and simplistic plot. Pedantic performances, particularly by Bullock Whiz-bang CGI is nothing more than porn to the Oscar-voting crowd. Whatever Hollywood produces - they have to vote for. They have to vote for something, and give an Oscar to something - however shallow, uninteresting, boring, pedantic, etc.Too bad Clooney wasted his time on this one. And the plot would have been much better if Bullock's character would have 'bought it' within the first 5 minutes.In fact the whole movie should have been 5 minutes long. That's pretty much how much 'real material' the film had. 5 minutes. The end. Boring. Stupid. Pedantic. Move on.",1,4,9,2 March 2014
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," a vacuous vehicle latched onto by philistine fools
","Disney's approaching the philistine mega & evangelical churches was a disgusting marketing ploy along the same lines as the equally disgusting yet aptly bloodthirsty worshiping 'Passion of the Christ' - it's all a sign of the times. A time when corporatism and warmongering and religion go hand in hand. A time when the worship of money and power match up quite nicely with what was wrought from 2000 years of bloody history from organized religion.But what the mega & evangelical church pastors didn't bargain for perhaps was a plot-less heartless mess of the film. Knowing how it was being used by the churches & Disney cast a wide shadow which almost prevented me from seeing it. But I did see it Christmas day. And what I found was a soulless movie. A movie which matches up with the soulless corporatist warmongering which modern conservative churches wallow in today in America. There was no plot. No feeling. The talking animals were absurd, and their talking disgraced & demeaned what our fellow animals really are - just as Disney's films did in the past.The only useful thing I got out of the film was thinking again about the whole absurd nature of the mythical Jesus's resurrection. Lewis makes a vague reference to it with when the lion sacrifices himself. But what does he sacrifice himself for? Why does he do it? Because of an arbitrary and chosen law. An adherence to 'old magic.' 'It's all poppycock,' I thought, 'just as is what Christians claim happened with their mythical Jesus, in paying for sins passed down to us by our fathers. The concept that sons & daughters must pay for the sins of their fathers is a reprehensible concept,' I thought some more.So perhaps the church preachers succeeded in having a message conveyed, by latching onto Disney's corporatist fascist greed in a disgusting marketing attempt to use religion to market their mess of a film - but the message conveyed is perhaps not what the preachers wanted perhaps. The synergistic marketing conveyed a message that organized religion in America today primarily worships at the feet of fascist corporatist warmongering. And the film itself, with it's vacuous & wrote nature, shows that it's little more than a self serving vehicle for the corporation known as Disney, a vehicle which the philistine evangelical churches latched on to to serve their own selfish interests.The poor person centered teachings of the mythical Jesus are far removed from these blatant but vacuous attempts to suck ever more of the uneducated & increasingly disenfranchised American workers, into an ever increasing sense of self denial & delusion - but a state of self denial which serves New American Fascism. Yes, fascism is on the march in America, and sadly Lewis's Narnia is yet another victim.For comparison, the Narnia story as conveyed on PBS a few years ago was more interesting. But I recommend not wasting your time on this latest mess. Instead, go buy the expanded DVD versions of Lord of the Rings, and maybe check out the PBS Narnia version from your local library or buy it - if you were a fan of the written version. But don't waste your time on this wannabee imitator - on this vacuous soulless sham of the film latched onto by preachers who love war, money, and corporatist power wrought through disgusting marketing synergies. Bletch. Away from me you trashy film. Away from me thou philistines.",1,9,24,26 December 2005
Brokeback Mountain," cardbord cutouts - not believable
","The professional reviews for this film are strange. Some loved it. A few thought it was formulaic. One wanted more body fluids to show up in the gay sex scene. I didn't have the later sentiment. It's possible it was formulaic perhaps. It wasn't particularly moving for me though either. What I came away from the film with was this impression: The movie was believable up until the first gay sex scene. And all the subsequent gay encounters were not believable either. At one point one of the two core cowboys met another presumably gay man and he asked him out. I watched in disbelief and wondered 'how the hell did he know that third man was gay?' It was as if they both had built in gay-dar. Maybe since I'm not gay (so far as I know, but I'm pretty sure not) maybe I don't have a keen gay-dar spidey-sense, and perhaps I cannot recognize it in others. On the other hand perhaps the best option is to go with my first and continuing core impressions on this one, and that is this: all the gay portrayals in this film felt fake and artificial and like cardboard. Perhaps the more emotionally malleable or infantile among us saw great & deep meaning & value, & sucked up all the stuff which selected professional reviewers saw through as trite formula. As for me I found the film boring, not satisfying for the most part, and largely not believable.",4,3,31,26 March 2006
