The Rock," Peep This Reviews
","Note: this is the only proof available that Michael Bay can make a competent and enjoyable film. Everything else associated with him seems to be cinematic cancer. It's an amazing action film. Too bad he spews out live action cartoons that are easily digestible to mainstream audiences. This one is a keeper, no doubt",7,3,4,9 July 2017
Black Swan," Peep This Reviews
",An intense psycho-sexual thriller set in the world of professional and cut throat ballet. Beautifully blurs the lines of reality. Amazing performances from an exceptional cast. Goes along nicely in the same vein of 'the Wrestler'. Both tales of performers who use their body and movements to tell a story for a paying audience. Two sides of the same coin?,8,1,3,9 July 2017
The Big Lebowski," Peep This Reviews
","I think it might be against the law to make a list of cult movies and not include this. It wasn't too warmly received when initially released it has since spawned numerous books, annual conventions and a notoriously hilarious edited for television version. Lots has been said and written about it. It's one of the ultimate cult films.",9,0,1,9 July 2017
Green Room," Peep This Reviews
",One of the most intense films I've seen. It's an original and exciting story of an indie punk band trapped by neo-Nazis skinheads lead by Sir Patrick Stewart. A departure for him in terms of roles but one he owns like only he can. This movie delivers the tension like no other. A perfect movie for fans of horror and punk. I felt a personal relationship with these characters being a touring musician.,7,0,3,9 July 2017
Oldboy," Peep This Reviews
",Although I'm not thoroughly familiar with Korean movies. I can safely say this is the best one I've ever seen. The story is engrossing and the action is off the charts. This movie embraces the taboo topics that most movies would ignore or play down. Steer clear of the American re-make and check this out.,8,0,2,9 July 2017
American Psycho," Peep This Reviews
",The condescending attitude of the 1980's as seen through the eyes of a serial killer. Or is it just the sick fantasies of an extremely disturbed individual? It's extremely humerus and also filled with explicitly stylized violence and lots of blood. It's such a unique and twisted tale of insanity and vanity.,8,0,1,9 July 2017
The Shining," Peep This Reviews
","The most cerebral horror movie ever. It's more of an interpretation than an adaptation of the Stephen King novel. Easily one of the best and most effective horror film ever made, yet there is a very small body count but lots of blood. It's eye-witnessing a man's slow descent into absolute madness. One of Kubrick's best. Transcends true terror into art.",8,2,5,9 July 2017
Salt," Peep This Reviews
","It's easy to say this is a female 'James Bond or 'Jason Bourne' but it far excels such a description. In fact it's got better action than some of those movies. The action is very stylized and a bit over the top at times but it's consistently engaging. Forget Tombraider this is Angelina Jolie as the ultimate female action lead. Very well directed and features an exceptional cast who play everything very seriously even when it feels a bit silly, this is a big plus.",7,9,11,9 July 2017
Being John Malkovich," Peep This Reviews
",This movie is magnificent. It's tough to describe because it's one of the most off the wall bat-s!@t crazy plots ever conceived. Imaginative and inventive film making at it's best. A must see to believe that it was actually made. You never know where this movie is headed which makes it super enjoyable.,8,1,1,9 July 2017
Collateral," Peep This Reviews
",One of the best murder for hire films ever. Forget all those 'Mission Impossible' movies. This is the ultimate Tom Cruise as a bad-ass film that you'll ever see. And this is on top of the list of best Jamie Foxx performances (I would say he's only better in 'Ray'). A great stylish thriller with truly beautiful cinematography.,8,0,1,9 July 2017
The Machinist," Peep This Reviews
",Paranoia? A murder mystery that might not have actually happened? An emaciated Christian Bale? Affectionate prostitute? All of the above. This is a nightmare (not in a derogatory way) that slowly reveals itself right before your eyes. More proof of how gifted and committed Christian Bale is as an actor. Can be genuinely hard to watch at times.,8,0,2,9 July 2017
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Peep This Reviews
",Really surprised this hasn't gotten more attention. The absolute perfect blend of humor and over the top graphic violence. Rednecks. Dumb college students. And some of the best death scenes you'll see. Delivers the gore and the laughs. It's also very re-watchable and something you'll want to see with friends.,8,0,0,9 July 2017
28 Days Later...," Peep This Reviews
","This is the film that started the craze of fast moving infected un-dead people as opposed to the slow lumbering ones generally portrayed up until this point. A precious and over looked jewel in the crown of zombie movies. After 'Night of the Living Dead' and before 'The Walking Dead' there was this...and it is marvelous. A modern horror classic with great performances, beautiful cinematography and doesn't skimp on the gore.",8,0,2,9 July 2017
It Follows," Peep This Reviews
","A truly scary film for real horror fans. Every once in awhile a film comes along that redefines it's genre. In this case it's the supernatural horror variety. It's an expertly made film that is endlessly clever, doesn't rely on cheap jump scares and is genuinely unsettling to watch at times.",8,0,1,9 July 2017
Drive," Peep This Reviews
",Someone I know compared this to 'The Transporter' and action films like that. Not at all; that's like comparing a gourmet restaurant to a fast food joint. This film is beautifully shot and is masterfully acted. It is incredibly intense and has an amazing soundtrack. It transcends beyond a standard action film and becomes a dramatic experience that stays with you.,8,0,0,9 July 2017
The Mist," Peep This Reviews
","Director Frank Darabont had previously adapted two classic Stephen King tales into unforgettable films. One of which is heralded as one of the best movies ever made. Ever. So he goes to tap that well of Stephen King's material once again. He decides to venture out of the setting of period prison films into something that would be considered a more typical horror movie. A mist full of deadly creatures trap a group of people in a prison that's taken the shape of a supermarket. Tempers flair, people butt heads and a gripping story begins to unfold which has an ending that is radically different from it's source material but in King's own words is better than what he had originally written. How often does an author say that about an adaptation of his/her work. Um...never. Great film and worth watching in full color and in black and white as it was originally conceived.",8,0,2,9 July 2017
The Game," Peep This Reviews
","David Fincher is well known today for 'Gone Girl', 'The Social Network', 'Benjamin Button' and 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo' but this is an early film in his career that is also one of his best. A psychological thriller that is genuinely mysterious and constantly taking turns at unexpected points. Michael Douglas gives a pitch perfect performance as does Sean Penn, who may not have much screen time but steals every scene he's in.",8,0,1,9 July 2017
Gran Torino," Peep This Reviews
","My favorite Clint Eastwood movie...and I honestly can't really describe why. I just absolutely love this film and it was an instant masterpiece after I saw it for the first (of many) time. It's a drama that at it's core is simply about an individual grumpy man's version of 'family' evolving and changing. But it masterfully mixes family relations, race relations, intense drama with some well placed humor. I just hope that as both an actor and a director that this priceless film doesn't get lost in the vast shuffle of Mr. Eastwood's filmography",7,2,3,9 July 2017
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Peep This Reviews
",This some how manages to be the most unique and wonderful romantic comedy/drama ever but also the most depressing. Anyone who has ever gone through the break up of a serious relationship will identify with this film. Easily one of Jim Carrey's best roles. He masterfully handles the mix of drama and restrained humor.,8,0,0,9 July 2017
Taken," Peep This Reviews
","This movie single handily solidified Liam Neeson as one of the best action leads in modern films. He expertly handles the drama and intensity of the story as well as the phenomenal action sequences. He's done action before this and after this but this is the only must see. It's a very re-watchable movie with unnecessary sequels, just stick with the original.",8,0,0,9 July 2017
Grindhouse," Peep This Reviews
","This is a movie not just watched but you experience. You have two brilliantly trashy films from two incredibly talented directors that are sandwiched in with the best faux trailers ever, it's soo good that a couple of the fake previews become actual fully developed movies in their own right. A great double feature with some really fun goodies in the mix. Side note: while the films are available individually, it's best seen as one. Especially because you'll miss out on most of the trailers which were expertly made by some fine directors.",8,0,0,9 July 2017
The Fly," Peep This Reviews
","Be afraid. This is the epitome of 'body horror'. No need for CGI, this film is full of some of the best practical effects and costumes you'll see and they still hold up to this day. One of David Cronenberg's finest achievements. Just wow...be very afraid. A rare instance where the re-make is vastly superior to the original.",9,1,1,9 July 2017
In Time," Peep This Reviews
","I avoided this movie because I judged a book by it's cover. Sci-fi action thriller where the minutes and hours of your life are literally currency that people will kill for. That sounds interesting, oh but it's got Justin Timberlake in it. No thanks. I was wrong. Not only does the fast paced plot keep you fully engaged but JT holds his own, Amanda S does her thing and Cillian Murphy steals the show. It's well written, well acted and wonderfully directed. The visuals are soo good that you could turn off the sound and watch it.",7,1,1,9 July 2017
The Witch," Peep This Reviews
",To class this a horror film is misleading. It's tag-line is 'A New England Folktale' and that sums it up perfectly. Yes there are elements of horror and yes there is a witch but this is more of a drama than a horror flick. It's an exceptionally well made movie and worth watching but if you're more of a jump scare/gore fan this may not be the movie for you. If you want a really good folktale that's creepy than it doesn't get better than this.,8,1,2,9 July 2017
Man on Fire," Peep This Reviews
","Denzel Washington and Tony Scott have made 5 films together. This is the best of that bunch from an incredible actor and influential director. It's brutal and unrelenting and I absolutely love it. It's emotionally powerful and gripping while also featuring fantastic stylish shots, a very talented ensemble cast with vicious but realistic violence and action",8,3,4,9 July 2017
Army of Darkness," Peep This Reviews
","The 'Evil Dead' series gets lots of deserved love. But in the midst of all that love the original film, it's re-imagining, the comics and now TV series over shadow part three. Just because it doesn't have 'Evil Dead' in the title this is an epic film. Slapstick humor, violence, gore are all on display in this criminally under-rated masterpiece of a the beloved franchise. Side note: There are many versions of this film available due to many different factors most involving the studio not approving of certain aspects of the film. It's all good but the bootleg/director's cut with the original ending is the must see.",6,0,0,9 July 2017
The Wrestler," Peep This Reviews
",A prime example of an actor completely disappearing into a role and becoming a character that you forget is fictional and becomes a whole new person that could easily exist in reality. A very powerful and emotional story. Don't hesitate if you think you need to like professional wrestling to enjoy this thoroughly engrossing movie. This is a performance by Mickey Rourke that needs to be seen over and over. A master class in acting. Makes for a great double feature with 'Black Swan'.,8,2,2,9 July 2017
1408," Peep This Reviews
",In a world that's over saturated in adaptations of master of the macabre Stephen King's works it can be tough to stand out. But creams rises to the top and this is one of the best. The premise is pretty simple but fascinating and it's executed marvelously. Relies on tension and mystery for it's scares not mindless gore.,7,0,1,9 July 2017
Jackie Brown," Peep This Reviews
","It seems that this gem becomes overshadowed sometimes by Tarantino's other films. But it's easily one of his best. It's got all his classic elements: smart and witty dialogue, unique characters, a constantly weaving plot and his trademark violence. Plus it has that classic 'Tarantino' soundtrack filled with some truly wonderful tunes.",8,5,6,9 July 2017
True Romance," Peep This Reviews
","Visionary director Tony Scott brings an early Quentin Tarantino script to life. The cast is beyond amazing (Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman Samuel L Jackson & more) especially the leads that play an amazingly lovable couple, the dialogue is witty and smart (some of Tarantino's best), the violence is bloody and realistic, plus plenty of dark humor. What else could you want in a movie? Side note: apparently Brad Pitt's stoner character was the inspiration for 'Pineapple Express'.",9,3,4,9 July 2017
Beetlejuice," Peep This Reviews
","Before Michael Keaton was Batman or Birdman he was the ghost with the most. So is this the best haunted house movie ever? Well if you like the strange and unusual with your spooks than this is for you. One of Tim Burton's best, prior to putting Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp in everyone of his films. Great score and practical effects bring even more to the table. Honestly not sure how this got a PG rating...because it has one of the best F-Bombs ever. Seriously. EVER.",8,1,1,9 July 2017
