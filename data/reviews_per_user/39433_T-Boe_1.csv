Requiem for a Dream," Horrible and raw, but probably a necessary watch.
","This is a tough film to watch, because the main theme is of addictions and their consequences, and how we're never really in control of them.I didn't enjoy watching it at all, it's actually quite terrifying, because it illustrates so well how addictions can consume and ultimately ruin lives. Initially, you tend to think that you have nothing in common with the 'drug addicts' portrayed in the film. But as the film progresses, you learn more about the characters and their spiral out of control, and it becomes evident that they are relatively normal individuals, each with their own issues, but with ambitions and dreams as well. Then you begin to question how detached you really are from them.Drugs make up a large part of the film, but it definitely isn't a film about the effects of drug addiction. Drug addictions are devastating, you don't need a film to tell you that. Rather the film explores how and why the individuals got into their positions, and when you realise this, then it becomes really tough to watch. I can't really explain further why I think this film is good. There are some things which I thought didn't have to be in the film, like a rather pointless (in my opinion) sex scene. I will probably never watch it again, and there is no real solution to the message it sends. I don't even know if it will change me or my outlook on things significantly. But it deserves a watch if you've never seen it, it may change your life.",9,0,1,19 August 2012
