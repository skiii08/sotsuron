The Blair Witch Project," Poor!
","This is a case where there was certainly a lot more thought put into the marketing campaign than was put into the movie.  If you are going to do a film without at least an outline of scripted dialogue at least have individuals who are talented enough to improvise.  What you have here over and over is a group of people who cannot think of anything to say except #@'!%* this, @#!^&* that, #*^%!' her or him or it.  Innovative?  Hardly. I found it hard to believe that anyone would be frightened by this silliness. A total waste of time.",2,0,2,21 May 2002
Once Upon a Time in America," Extremely disappointing.
","What a disappointment this film continues to be.  The first time I viewed the film many years ago I attributed its failure to being too severely edited for time constraint reasons.  I was wrong.  This new extended version just adds another hour or so of more confusion and general boredom.  What a waste.  This film has some of the finest production values you could ever hope for.  Some of the sets are like time capsules. However, unfortunately for the this viewer the movie comes off as often incoherent and self-indulgent.  Some reviewers seem to like Morricone's soundtrack.  I personally found it to be extremely grating.  Don't be mislead, 'The Godfather' trilogy this isn't.  A true waste of a lot of time for the viewer and a collossal waste of movie making talent.",6,4,9,24 December 2003
Stalag 17," Good for the time but the humor is severely dated.
","I remembered liking this film very much 40 years ago, but after watching it recently I was startled by how dated it appeared.  For me what was most distracting was the juvenile humor of the characters Animal (Robert Strauss) and Harry 'Hot Lips' Shapiro (Harvey Lembeck).  Not only is the humor juvenile but both of them have much too much screen time.  I would imagine it worked much better in the stage play.  Holden, Graves, Brand, Preminger, etc., of the supporting cast are excellent as usual.  Unfortunately, there is way too much silliness going on in this POW camp for the movie to be taken very seriously.  When a German guard gives his rifle to a pow so he can play volleyball it completely loses any claim to realism and should be treated strictly as a comedy.",7,4,6,26 August 2003
The Great Escape," A POW camp more comfortable than many 3 star motels.
","Even conceding the fact that this POW camp was run by the Luftwaffe and not the SS this has got to be the silliest representation of a POW camp ever put to film and I include 'Hogan's Heroes' in this statement.  At least 'Hogan's Heroes' admitted it was a comedy.  After viewing the Germans represented in this piece of malarkey I am surprised World War II lasted 6 months.  I remember wondering when I first saw this as a teenager why the Germans would allow a person in solitary confinement to have games to play.  Now I know 39 years later; they wouldn't. Considering how heroic the actual events really were it is shame to see them made to look so cartoonish in this vehicle for Steve McQueen.  Good thing for him the German's didn't know what was being planned in all those private POW rooms available to those crazy flyboy prisoners.  I noticed on the DVD box someone called it the greatest World War II movie ever made.  If it is then I guess the WW II veterans I talked to were really embellishing how tough it was.  I am not completely panning this movie because it is fun to see some very good performers in their younger years (I gave it 5 out of 10).  However, having seen this movie in 1964 and in 2002 I can't say it has aged well at all.  I suspected it was a sanitized piece of propaganda in 1964 and am quite sure of it now.",5,12,28,30 August 2002
