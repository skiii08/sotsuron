Vertigo," I don't care what critics say -- I didn't like this movie.
","I am a huge Hitch fan. And I do think that Vertigo was very artfully done and a technical masterclass BUT the plot is weird, misunderstood, complicated, creepy, and drawn out! There were some key moments that I enjoyed. But, the main plot being that a ma was obsessed with a possibly possessed woman is just weird like I said.Like I also said, the film is a artful success (e.g. the beautiful Golden Gate Bridge shot.) It is Hitch's first color film and it looks really good in color. I also think the costuming is superb. the Los Angeles scenery is pretty cool also.If you are in to classical films like Gone With the Wind or Casablanca this will probably please you. If you like mysteries and don't mind it being over 2 hours, you'll probably like it too.Also, if you are expecting a regular Hitchcock film (you know a suspense piece), Vertigo will be a disappointment.It's just okay for me.",5,6,17,12 December 2006
The Devil Wears Prada," A stylish and funny comedy that's spot on.
","The plot: okay so the plot is a little bit predictable but I think that it is still very fun to watch it unfold in front of you. I mean it's a little Ugly Betty and Princess Diaries but it's fun.The performances: First of all, Meryl Streep's performance is superb. She was literally perfect as Miranda Preistly (and the hair is rockin') Anne Hathaway as Andy Sacs is pretty good. I mean it's as good as usual. Emily (Miranda's assistant) delivers a solid performance. She's sarcastic so it's pretty funny.Anything Else: This movie has a lot to do with style so you basically feel cool just watching it. And how bad could that be. Meryl Streep is so mean it's funny. The costumes are great. The New York scene is awesome and they make plenty of Starbucks references (which is awesome lol.) The dialogue is very funny. Everything about 'Prada' is very funny.",7,2,4,18 December 2006
