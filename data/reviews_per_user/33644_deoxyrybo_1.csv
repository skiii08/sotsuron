Hereditary," Seen it Twice, just to be sure. Yeah...It's totally Forgettable
","Looks good. Filmed well. Well shot, whatever (what doesn't 'look' good these days). Really good acting. Some creepy scenes, definitely, but overall, if some of your film friends are referring to it as a 'slowburn' movie, that is an understatement. I would call it a 'slowbore' because it was really, really, really, really, really, boring. A few scenes, maybe 4, kinda woke me up a bit because they were creepy. Even with the big reveal at the end how it goes all witchcraft/prophecy I felt totally disconnected to the male character who becomes the main character all of a sudden, revealed in the last few minutes.
The reveal is definitely creepy, but I found myself scratching my head and promptly removing this movie from my collection as nothing I would ever watch more than twice! Mind you, the scene where she's crawling on the ceiling is probably the coolest and creepiest part. I'd say watch it once just for those scenes.",5,1,3,4 March 2019
