Source Code," Better than expected
","From the trailer I expected an action focused film, but it ended up being a fun science fiction exploration that felt natural and as if the audience is in the same position as Jake Gyllenhaal. If you enjoy science fiction for with ethical and character issues then this is a good movie for you. Though it could have been more of a mystery or thriller style movie, the focus really is on how Gyllenhaal's character develops rather than the dramatic situation. Sometimes the next step or plot event that progresses the movie feels too easy and in once case contrived. Don't expect a lot of action despite frequent explosions. Definitely an interesting movie that touches on hypothetical ethical issues.",7,0,1,5 November 2011
Rango," Unusual, fun western
","Rango is very fun to watch for fans of Western movies with twists. It reminds me of Kung Fu Panda in re-creating the feel of cult classic Kung Fu movies. The setting and supporting characters feel like a Western though exaggerated for humor, but it makes the characters more appealing and easier to sympathize with. In addition there are fantasy elements of destiny and supernatural phenomena that make it very different from unique and were a really pleasant surprise for me. More generally the plot is predictable, but the pace of the movie feels great. The movie grew on me the more I watched it, with Rango going from an annoying and out of touch with reality to fairly endearing. This movie is also beautiful. The desert scenes were gorgeous and the characters had great detail and expressions.The humor is odd and dry. There are death scenes, so I wouldn't necessarily say this is a good movie for kids. A humorous, weird, comedic but respectful Western that was really fun to watch.",8,1,1,29 November 2011
