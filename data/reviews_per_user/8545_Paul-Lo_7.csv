The Avengers," The Avenger Review
","*When: 2012/4/28 20:00*Where: Dream Mall, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.*How: Driving to theater.*Why: My cellphone company Taiwan Mobile invite me, a member of VIP, with two free tickets to see this movie.*Whom: went with my friend PingZong. Originally, I'm not that kind of big fan for the comic books and want to yield to another friend, however, he's busy that day, so i just went with the other one.*What: despite of some irrationality of the movie, what it inspires me is the idea of making an elaborate story with diversely sub-stories and some hints in them and converge later into a cohesive one. The idea should be huge with key features across the sub-stories so that a major one can subsequently consolidate them. Some idea of scene doesn't fall into the traditional and surprise and impress you then.Conclusion: a good one for recreation.",7,0,8,28 April 2012

","1. need pilot colleague's help - Parents could also drive the development of children by exceling parents' efforts and achievement.

Life of Pi," the Will
","*When: 7:20, 25th Nov. 2012 *Where: Maichilai, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.*How: Driving to theater. After exercising.*Why: Ann Lee create a film which is echoed well from the critics. although I didn't successfully join the Taiwan Mobile VIP due to seats too much near screen for my Mom, I decided to go to see it and share with Janet.*Whom: Myself.*What: Despite of the confusion about which one of the stories is true eventually, there are some deep meanings inside of the film. The father next to me was yawning in some quiet scene. Maybe he's still figure out the essence of it. The great things I enjoy are the artistic design and natural arrangement of 3D. The core idea delivered from this film is not only the will of survival but also a philosophy of life in an unknown adventure.*Conclusion: a great one for refreshing.",9,4,8,25 November 2012
Man of Steel," imperfectly good.
","*When: 20:30, 16th Jun. 2013 *Where: Vieshow, KH.*Whom: Ting *How: Drive; 2 Movie Vouchers *Why: Storied and Produced by Christopher Nolan.*What: Final fight scene is a little bit unnecessary outrageous. From audience point of view, they are invincible and how would there be a win by these fists and fights. One of them would be good to speak out 'it's gonna be forever with these.' And the things should be added more in are the bad sides of Clark to demonstrate he was not always that good to make him a more believable person with real life experience and recover back from the inside of him. I like the point that the bad guy is not always from a standpoint of view of purely evil with a reasonable cause which relates to the good guy as well. This way it shows us the mixed and complex feeling of characters which reflect our own selves. It's realistic but not that realistic enough to become an adult movie like Batman series since the aftermath of the fight is enormous without any sad or sorry from the nationwide leader and humans' point of view which means not all people are that good enough to think of him as a good guy and ask him to responsible for the recovery. However, if this is the case, superman will somewhat feel like batman. :-) This is just my thought. Maybe the next installment would be much darker like the Dark Knight.",7,0,1,16 June 2013
Aladdin," A Spectabular Journey
","This is a wonderful movie that deserves the look.
The movie is beyond my expectation.",9,84,228,21 May 2019
Mission: Impossible II," John Woo ruined Everything.
","I don't know if the script was also being written by the director or not.If yes, I think it's a 'No Wonder Why It's All His Fault.'If no, I think John rewrote the script (to fit his simple mind).Bottom line: don't let him touch any good franchise.",1,2,5,25 July 2018
The Wolverine," Arrangement of Scene is not bad.
","*When: 20:50, Aug. 1st 2013 *Where: MaiChiLai, KH.*How: Drive *Why: an escape of exhausted work day.*Whom: Myself.*What: I like the scenes of the arrangement regard less of some plot were not really understood. The struggling inside the actor is good. I didn't actually see the version of comic one but this one in movie doesn't actually need to be the same as the original. I like the character who is full of justice and has emotional history and cast out the daemon inside of him. I don't judge too much detail of the movie just to capture the spirit of the plot and script.*Conclusion: good.",8,1,6,1 August 2013
