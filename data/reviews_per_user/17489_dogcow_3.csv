The Blair Witch Project," TOTAL GARBAGE! HUGE CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST RIPOFF!!!!
","With all the hype you would think this movie is actually scary but naaa...its total garbage, it makes you dizzy, the ending is incredibly disappointing. If you wanna see a faux-documentary that'll really make you p**s your pants watch Cannibal Holocaust. And leave this movie where it belongs, in the garbage bin.",Null,0,1,24 July 1999
Man on the Moon," Carrey does a great Kaufman impression...but
","At first i thought wow, Carrey does a hell of a Kaufman impression, he talks like him, acts like him, and even looks like him....but then i thought...maybe its not carrey doing a kaufman impression, but andy doing his jim carrey impression ... something to ponder while watching this wonderful film.",10,0,0,25 December 1999
Life Is Beautiful," Life is Beautiful and so is this movie!
","I am not much for the foreign film drama stuff. (usually the only subtitled movies i watched are kung-fu), but I had seen Benigni in Johnny Toothpick and also in Son of the pink panther. After he won the academy award I went to see this movie and found it to be one of the most touching films I've ever seen. Its perfectly balanced first hour is hysterical while the second is sad. During the ending i did something i've only done at a few other movies. I cried. You probably will too.... even if not by the end of the movie you too will see that this is a truly great film and the title holds very true... life is beautiful.",10,1,2,30 April 1999
