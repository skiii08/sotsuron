First Man," The movie is just noise
","The movie is 2+ hours.. I watched the first 1 then left, so did more than 10 people.. it is just noise noise noise.. Also I believe the movie was filmed with a no anti shack and a fully defective zoom in camera..Bad.. I don't understand how it got 7.7 review.. 1.7 would've been fair..Sorry Armstrong... the movie sucks",1,9,16,28 October 2018
