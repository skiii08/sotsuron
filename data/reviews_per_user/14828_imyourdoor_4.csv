Sucker Punch," Don't Judge a Movie by its Title????
","Hello folks its the guru again but this time here with a new Title coming in at #2 for its opening week. Okay, where do I begin, how about the introduction.Gotta give props to the writers, the storyline is pretty cool. The main character basically loses her mind and goes into a mental institute where there she explores the imagination of her mind/journey.Basically chicks kick ass and actually know how the fire big guns, ha ha. But another great point was the graphics, they were also neat, but not so original. And almost, if you notice there are a lot of scenes that intertwine with other action movies. (how bizarre) So chicks kicking ass, cool storyline, and pretty neat graphics. Go figure.I give it only one thumbs up for the computer stuff that was great!Other than that it was basically a regular college girl flick meets a high school hunk (in dream that is)Okay tata for now!",6,1,4,29 March 2011
Just Go with It," Ps: I am gonna say that, ...
","First off, its an Adam Sandler/Jennifer Aniston film. Who can complain about that, right? So funny meets funny drama, I likes it. The humor was excellent and I seriously thought the two mixed just right. Okay on an island vacationing what better than to throw a super model in the mix. hint hint Brooklyn Decker shows off her newest acting career being along a supporting cast to say the least. It worked, what can I say.So, drama as couples try and solve life issues all in one vacation, pretty much. Jeez, where's the excitement of dipping your feet in the pool, oh wait!, Jennifer Anistion shows off her gorgeous body and nails the role of an ex. Plus that Dave Mathews character plays a great supporting role and the music is a plus too.Don't wanna sound so over going and boring, yet, just expect Adam and Jennifer thats all I can say without giving any of it away.Cheers guys, and please go spend your well earned money you will enjoy this one, I promise!skotti signing out.",7,1,3,30 March 2011
The Dark Knight," This movie sincerely drenches an actors talent
","The Dark Knight is a movie for the books to say the least. The completeness of it beautifies the sliver screen at its greatest. It touches all genres and caps it with epic action scenes along with the storyline as well. I was impressed by the effects especially. The acting was also tapped with perfection coming from the eye of a camera. The wardrobe and the props were spectacular and very trendy. What I really liked about it too, was how all the stories happening intertwine in a very cool way. The Joker's performance was astounding. That role, in my opinion, was one of the best that I have seen to date.I hope the next Batman will take the footsteps of this film. As a fan, I am eager to see what the creators come up with. The Batman films have always really came through when talking about a sequel. So, this makes it interestingly insightful. Anyhow, The Dark Knight is a must see again and again. Speaking of that, its about to start on TNT, gotta go!",10,1,3,12 February 2011
Rango," If your ready for a great adventurous animation, Here it is!
","The names Rango! Here is a great flick for youngsters and for old youngsters like myself. This movie has a little bit of everything. It begins with the four charactered owls that happen to narrate throughout the whole adventure.Rango is a lizard that finds his way into the wild west as everything is happening. He meets a lot of interestingly put people. As it seems, a lost lizard, greeted into an old western town, becomes a local, and saves the water supply; to make it short. However, included into the journey is the humor that Johnny Depp brings along with a really cool story, and the characters are super cool and funny too! It had me giggling aloud. I was impressed by the creation and the scene animation if you will. They did a really good job on the scrip and how the story unfolds. It had me guessing and I never knew what to expect. And, there was never really a dull moment. Not to mention, the old Spanish set was spectacular and the music as well.Another high point to the viewing was that it touched not only comedy scenes but also a dramatic take put together with action scenes! I loved it! I truly recommend this movie for all genre driven fans.Ps: Look out for all the catch and find stuff, Hawaiian shirt (hint hint)",8,0,2,13 March 2011
