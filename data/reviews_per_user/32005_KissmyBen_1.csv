Requiem for a Dream," I can't believe I'm in love with a movie starring Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans.
","Best Movie Ever.I came out of this movie feeling weak in the knees, and I thought I was going to vomit. Never before has any media made me feel that way before. This movie is not for the faint of heart, but everyone should see it, anyway. How anyone can use drugs after seeing this movie is beyond me. I've never seen a piece more visceral and engaging than this film. And if you haven't seen it yet, BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN to see the unedited version. I don't know how much was cut out, but it was too much.",10,0,1,12 October 2001
