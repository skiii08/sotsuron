Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 1 down, 2 to go
","Episode I was just what I expected it would be; the beginning.  I know there are several out there who condemn Episode I because it did not live up to the first three installments.  I agree.  It was not even close to being as epic as the other three.  But you have to remind yourself, the first three was years after Episode I.  Star Wars is a story from a book.  The first chapter is almost always spent introducing characters and developing scenes and plot.  Take, for example Tolken's 'The Hobbit'.  The first couple chapters, some would say, bore us with so many names and events, its overwhelming.  But that is what makes it worth while in the end.  Which is what we have all already experienced with Episodes IV, V and VI.  However, Episode I seems complex due to the fact that, because of the first three, there are several unanswered questions and one gets the feeling Lucas is cranking this one out to start on Episode II.I loved this movie.  One thing I did that may be helpful for those of you out there is not to watch any promos. Stay away from all the trailers.  Go into the movie not knowing much at all about it.  Lets face it, we all already have our own expectation for what we should be seeing.  Don't let the ads create new ones.  It is my firm belief that promotion ads and marketing can sink a movie.Before I end, I do need to add one thing.  Couldn't they have found someone better to play Aniken.  Every time this kid opens his mouth, my skin crawls. Oh, and a little less Jar Jar on my movie burger thanks.  Too much tends to come back and haunt me later.",7,1,2,14 September 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Oh, how it pains me.
","This is the second time I have commented on this movie.  The first time, I was at a loss of words as I was still awestruck.  Now, as I read through other comments, I return with a fire in my belly.  Anyone who has anything negative to say about this movie is missing it.  I hear about poor action scenes, acting that is lacking something, missing events from the book, the list goes on.  They say a movie is great if and only if all the acting is great, the plot has little to no holes, it must flow, it must meet a list of criteria.  I say that if you watch this movie, or any other, checking things off a list, you have missed it. To love this movie the way some many Tolkien fans have, is to remember 2 things.  1 - Let go.  Don't anticipate every move. (no matter how predictable)  Enjoy what you see and hear and feel.  Do you ever notice that children enjoy movies more than most adults.  It is because they have no expectations or demands.  They simply let go.(# 1 is true for any movie)  2 - LOTR is a very long story.  Sure there seems to be relationships missing, characters are not round, story lacking.  There is a much bigger picture there than the just the 3hour movie we all saw.  My take on LOTR.  This movie is what epic stories are about.  Mr. Lucas could take a few pointers from Mr. Jackson.  There is something old and historic about the characters and how they are portrayed.  It is a fictional story with fictional people in a fictional time.  It only makes sense to leave you guessing to an extent.  And most of the time, the actors/actresses say more without speaking.  Each character is full of fear, terror, doubt and urgency; and we see it in thier faces. The visuals and effects are so rich and full of flavor, our eyes eat up every scene. 
This is a great movie, because after I have seen it and am leaving the theatre, I feel like I have just came back from a trip.  My mind is still in the movie, reliving the events.  It's great because I jumped when I was scared, I laughed, I wept and I felt anger.  This movie made me feel.  That is what makes a great movie.  Thomas Edison failed at many things, but it does not take away the fact that he was a great scientist.  'To say a rose is but a rose, is to catalog it before it has had its chance.  Look at the rose.  So many shades of red and pink we have never before noticed.  Feel the soft curves of its peddles. They are firm, yet fragile; tender and warm. And when you smell it, it exudes a fragrance like no other. . . LOOK AT THE ROSE.  Simple, and common. . .and so very wonderful.'",10,1,1,10 August 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Magical!!!!!
","What can be said about this movie that hasn't already been said.  What words to use that haven't already been uttered.  If  you are a fan of Tolken, see this movie.  There are many who I have heard saying that there were several holes, it didn't stay 'True' to the book or some of the relationships were not complete.  Oh well!!!!  Few movies do not have holes, what movie can be 'True' 100% to the book and as far as the relationships, this is the first of three.  Relationships have time. This is a great movie.  Its like watching a Rembrant painting come to life.  So vibrant and illuminating.  I will see this movie again.  Maybe then I can say more.  I am still a bit awestruck and I find myself at a loss for words.  See this movie, you won't be disappointed.",10,0,0,28 December 2001
Braveheart," Wallace!! Wallace!! Wallace!!
","I have read all the complaints about how this movie is historically inaccurate.  It portrayes the Scots as noble, 'goodie goodies' and the English as the evil oppressors.  And in doing so, creates a false belief in what really happened.  If you went to this movie for a history lesson, then you went for the wrong reason.  And you probably didn't like it. ITS A MOVIE!  And a great one at that.  If you ever watch it again, look at Gibsons eyes.  There is such rage and passion, and many did not see that because they were busy saying, 'This text doesn't say it happened that way.' Movies don't have to be 100% accurate, they do have to be believeable within the context of it's time and place but not accurate.  See this movie and enjoy it.",9,3,5,10 August 2002
