United 93," The Real Flight 93
","The real United flight 93 called in a bomb scare and became silent until it landed at Cleveland's Hopkins Airport under the guise of a bomb scare. There coincidentally another plane with a similar bomb scare out of Boston that landed after it's mission was called off. It was on the news and FEMA's evacuation is on many 'conspiracy theory' websites. 93 is a lie and many people know it. Although I didn't watch the movie I can only guess 'it did a very good job of making you feel the way you should feel when you think about these types of things'.Here's that infamous conspiracy theory movie with proof of timed detonations followed by an account of United 93: http://video.google.com/video play?docid=1519312457137943386Reported by 9News Staff Web produced by:Liz Foreman 9/11/01 11:43:57 AM A Boeing 767 out of Boston made an emergency landing Tuesday at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport due to concerns that it may have a bomb aboard, said Mayor Michael R. White. White said the plane had been moved to a secure area of the airport, and was evacuated. United identified the plane as Flight 93. The airline did not say how many people were aboard the flight. United said it was also 'deeply concerned' about another flight, Flight 175, a Boeing 767, which was bound from Boston to Los Angeles. On behalf of the airline CEO James Goodwin said: 'The thoughts of everyone at United are with the passengers and crew of these flights. Our prayers are also with everyone on the ground who may have been involved. 'United is working with all the relevant authorities, including the FBI, to obtain further information on these flights,' he said.
