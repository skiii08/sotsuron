Mission: Impossible III," M:i:III? Are you serious?
","Let me begin by saying that this film is immensely entertaining. There are some intense action sequences that are a lot of fun to watch. Also, there are some nice twists and turns in the plot. However, several slip-ups in the film prevent it from becoming a good movie. First of all, this film never acknowledges what type of movie it is. Is it a spy-thriller? Is it a shoot-em-up action flick? Is it a B-movie? J.J. Abrams and the writing staff never clearly identifies the film with any of these sub-genres. Is it possible that the film fits all three of these categories? Also, Owen Davian, portrayed by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, is plain and simple a poorly scripted character. There is absolutely nothing to his character. All we know about him is that he's evil and he's a sadist. What a waste of Hoffman's vast talent. I really hated Davian, but I really didn't have any reason other than he wasn't a nice guy. And finally, why does this film have to rely so much on advanced technology (that probably doesn't even exist)? Many of the action sequences cut corners by using technology. I mean, what ever happened to good old-fashioned espionage?",4,7,18,7 May 2006
