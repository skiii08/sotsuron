Miracle," Best hockey movie ever made
","I had the opportunity to see Miracle over the weekend and I must say it was moving.  I would call it a male cry movie.  It told the story pretty much as it happened.  I was on the edge of my seat for most of the Olympic portion of the movie and I had to hold back applause as I wanted to stand up and cheer each goal and each save.  Even knowing the outcome of the Russia game firsthand, I sat in my seat biting my nails and my nerves were shot.  I consider this the best hockey movie ever made and I want to call it the 'Rudy' of hockey.",Null,0,0,9 February 2004
