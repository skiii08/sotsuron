Walk the Line," Walk The Line- Excellent
","Joaquin Phooenix delivers an excellent performance as the memorable Johnny Cash. It also seemed as if he was Johnny Cash. I loved Reese Witherspoon's performance as June Carter. She delivered a touching and strong performance. I teared up at the end when Johnny proposed to June. He promises loyalty and his love- 'You're my best friend, June.' I teared up because I realized that he doesn't lie to June because they remain faithful until they die. I loved to hear Phoenix sing, and he sang just like Cash. The best part of the movie is the scene where he delivers Folsom Prison Blues. This is an excellent film and those are a couple of reasons. Go see it if you haven't. 9/10.",9,0,0,16 January 2006
Chinatown," Roman Polanski's Greatest Work
","This is one of the greatest films ever made. It is a well-rounded movie containing classic scenes and quotes. This is truly a great story, and I like the fact that it is indirectly based on William Mulholland and is set in Los Angeles in the 1930's. Robert Towne, the screenwriter, did a magnificent job but Roman Polanski was right about the ending- I won't spoil it- which Towne was so much against. Jack Nicholson delivers one of his strongest performances as a Private Detective J.J. Gittes who faces many problems and uncovers many things that soon lead to a memorable night in Chinatown. Nominated for 11 Oscars, it won one for best screenplay, Robert Towne. This movie received an R Rating for no reason- there is hardly any violence, language, but there are some scenes that are kind of explicit involving really just dialog. This is a must see for anyone. 10/10.",10,1,3,16 January 2006
Citizen Kane," One of the greatest films ever made
","I am sure that many would agree that Citizen Kane is one of the greatest films ever made. Unlike the films of its day, Citizen Kane is shot magnificently- the cinematography is far superior than most films both nowadays and in the the past. This film was the one and only film that deserved an Oscar sweep in 1941, too bad. A strong performance by Orson Welles, a great story, and simply put- a masterpiece, make this the greatest film ever made. No wonder it is taught in film schools throughout the world. Roger Ebert stated that if there was one movie he could watch deserted on an island for hundreds of days, it would be Citizen Kane. 10/10 Excellent.",10,1,3,16 January 2006
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A true classic
","Dr. Strangelove is a true American classic that will always be one of the greatest movies ever made. It is a funny, satirical work that takes place during the Cold War. Peter Sellers delivers a classic performance as Dr. Strangelove, President Muffley, and Captain Mandrake- three performances! His acting wasn't as strong as it could be, but Dr. Strangelove is a truly classic character. George C. Scott delivers a strong, supporting performance along with Sterling Hayden. There are performances from James Earl Jones and Slim Pickens, as well. This is one of Stanley Kubrick's best movies and if not his greatest work. This is a must see for anyone. 9/10",9,2,4,15 January 2006
Jarhead," Wonderful Cinematography- False Story
","This movie is a bunch of bullshit. The Marines are shown as a bunch of perverted bastards who are brainwashed and are stupid. I've got news- just because one egg is rotten, it doesn't mean the whole dozen is. Basically, they show the Marine drill as abusive and not tolerable by any ordinary person. You know what? This is just a diss on the Marines. Who said boot camp was easy going for any branch of our military. The message is just not 100% true about our Marines. Overall, I believe that Jamie Foxx was and is the bomb and is very likable. The way the film is shot is very good and since I admire the Marines I like this film, not the message of the film, because I do not believe that the Marines are the only ones that are like this. 8/10.",7,0,2,16 January 2006
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Great movie
","This film covers a period in American history when Communism was on everyone's minds, and therefore the movie leans heavily on the subject. Edward R. Murrow is played by an excellent actor, one of the strongest performances of the year. George Clooney, Jeff Daniels, and Robert Downey Jr. also star and do very well. If there is one film that deserves to do well this year it is this movie. I like how it is filmed in black and white, which is more admirable over color since it is more common nowadays. George Clooney's best work as a director, and his best acting performance is from Syriana, however, this year. Excellent film, not great, but a must see. 10/10.",8,2,4,16 January 2006
Titanic," Awful
","It is insulting to think that this film was well-received. I guess it would be tragic if a film this well shot and expensive was turned down. Think about it, for one, Leonardo DiCaprio, as usual, delivers a crappy performance that is almost laughable, and so does Kate Winslet and the other people in the cast. Secondly, there is no great story- it is just a love story in the midst of an event that everyone knows about. Thirdly, the only reason it won Best Picture at the Oscars was because of the ending which is often mocked in commercials and the main song which is recognizable to anyone. The only reason it was a Box Office success was because it's the Titanic! It is a major event- no one was looking for a love story! Nothing goes for this movie except special effects and a nice song- PATHETIC!",4,1,5,16 January 2006
The Departed," terrible- and i'm not joking
","Throughout Scorsese's film career, his films have been so over rated. Let's tear this film down. Jack Nicholson- same old performance, different guy. The problem with Jack is that he acts because he wants Oscars, not because he is great, or even cares for acting. Secondly, how many times have I heard him talk the same way- pulling a joker on us. Leonardo DiCraprio, as usual, crappy, over rated performance. I swear that Scorsese has something going on with DiCaprio. He just is not a great actor and I must admit his performances make me laugh. He has a Bostonian accent, then an American, Bostonian, American- give me a break. I remember how Titanic was nominated for 14 Oscars, NEARLY EVERYTHING, except Dicaprio's performance. Hmmm, I wonder. Mark Wahlberg and Matt Damon- crappy acting again, only saying the 'f' word every other word to get a ridiculously stupid point across. Many people failed to see how this film robbed another movie- Infernal Affairs- which is much better than this film. Why was the film met with so much praise? Because of the casting and direction. Believe me, if Scorsese hadn't directed this and/or if this film didn't have an all-star cast but still had the same look- it would have been seen as a 'B' movie that would go nowhere. And that is what it is. Completely over rated, just like Goodfellas, but only ten times worse. The story was crappy, and the ending was very stupid and ridiculous. Scorsese needs to pack up his stuff and go home. He is in a desperate search for Oscars, which resulted this time in pity for him. The only reason Scorsese won was because of POOR MARTY, NEVER WON AN Oscar. LET'S GIVE ONE TO HIM SO HE DOESN'T FEEL BAD AND REALLY KNOW THAT HIS WORK SUCKS. As for Best Picture, I am really disappointed with the Academy. Another sympathy award for the years of crappy films of Scorsese- and to illustrate this further, JACK NICHOLSON PRESENTED THE AWARD WITH DIANE KEATON! Again, sympathy for mediocre actors just so we could see their faces light up- so Jack Nicholson may wrongly think inside that he is the main reason the film was great and should've been nominated instead of Wahlberg. BS! We must admit that Clint Eastwood is the master but was pushed aside this year all because of a sympathetic academy and many other as well. Little Miss Sunshine and Letters from Iwo Jima were the best films of 2006. Screw the wannabe mafia movie that can't even top the Godfather.",1,1,6,12 March 2007
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Forgotten Classic.
","One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is a forgotten classic. When was the last time anyone talked of it. It is a true shame because it is a great movie. For a movie that beat Jaws at the Oscars, it seems as if you would expect more from this movie. Nevertheless, I believe it remains a true classic story of friendship between McMurphy and Chief. Debuts done by Danny Devito and Christopher Lloyd are pretty funny. Nurse Ratched also does a wonderful job despite being a bigot. There are many scenes involving loyalty, humor, wit, and drama. It is a well-rounded film as a result. It won five Oscars including Best Picture and is Rated R for language and brief nudity. A must see and a classic. 10/10.",10,2,4,16 January 2006
Raging Bull," The greatest boxing film ever made.
","People speak very highly of Rocky and other boxing films. This is truly the best of all boxing films. All others are cheap imitations. Cinderella Man, Rocky, Million Dollar Baby, and Ali are not as good as this film. It is magnificently shot- EXCELLENT CINEMATOGRAPHY- the score works wonderfully with the story- the rise and fall of boxing star Jake LaMotta. I am convinced that Robert DeNiro delivers one of the greatest acting performances of movie history. He is literally up there with Marlon Brando and rightfully received the Best Actor Oscar of 1980. I am shocked that Raging Bull did not receive Best Picture. Maybe for its time, the language and sexual dialogue was not too appreciated. Don't let this deter you from seeing the movie. Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro work very well together and this is Martin Scorsese's greatest film. Taxi Driver, Gangs of New York or GoodFellas could not top this film. A true cinema masterpiece. 10/10.",10,2,2,27 January 2006
The Deer Hunter," Awful- hardly a classic
","I have no clue why this film was received so well. It has nothing going for it. There is hardly anything strong in Christopher Walken's acting, he had a very short performance- why did he win the Oscar? I can't see the point of the movie. The only point that was really illustrated was that people who come out of the Vietnam War were, for the most part, screwed up and brain washed. The wedding sequence is incredibly boring, it is truly a film about trailer trash America, and it seems that Robert DeNiro is the only one who shows good acting along with Meryl Streep. The only scenes that really give the film any hope, are the deer hunting scenes in which incredible choral music is heard. This film is not great- but it isn't bad.",9,0,0,16 January 2006
Munich," Munich- no point.
","This is probably Spielberg's average film. It is not a classic, it is not great, it is not terrible. It certainly is a good thriller, like a deadly chess game. Many have said that it is a great film, a classic- bullshit! It is a well shot film but it does not have a great story. Who the hell wants to watch a film about vengeance that does nothing in the end. Peace is the moral- something that cannot be stressed amongst the Israeli's and the Palestinians. It has some surprising scenes of frontal nudity and brutal violence that are always stressed by Spielberg for whatever reason. In the end, the vengeance the hit man leads turns into a whole bunch of nothing that the hit-man recognizes himself as he is slowly losing his team. Spielberg surprisingly then shows us a sex scene between the hit man (Eric Bana) and his wife in conjunction with the murders of the Israeli athletes and John William's score which is emotional. Again, Spielberg shows us more violence and tries to pull off a classic scene- you're not going to do that during a sex scene- the scene of the murders is already not classic. Spielberg was trying to pull off a Godfather sequence- ain't gonna work. The only thing I admired about the movie was the message- vengeance will not solve the problem, only peace will. 6/10.",6,1,3,16 January 2006
The Godfather," The Greatest Movie Ever Made
","This is the most powerful and greatest movie ever made. It has its mistakes (see the goofs section) but I am sure many would agree with me. Marlon Brando delivers the best acting performance in movie history and Francis Ford Coppola directs brilliantly, no matter what Robert Evans or Paramount thought. I think Bob Evans should have shut his mouth during production of this film because he would have ruined its greatness had Coppola lost his will to direct under his constant complaining. Al Pacino delivers a slightly good performance, Jimmy Caan delivers a great performance along with Robert Duvall. Several quotes and scenes make the movie memorable and to this day, powerful. This is a must see for anyone. 20/10.",10,0,2,16 January 2006
