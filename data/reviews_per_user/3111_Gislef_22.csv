The Devil's Advocate," Thumbs up for Pacino & script, Thumbs down for everything else
","First of all, Pacino.  For big bucks, this is probably the best performance as an actor as Satan in a movie.  Although John Glover is just as effective, without the hammy overacting/ranting, in 'Brimstone' (1998).  Pacino's performance is a tour de force.Although a lot of it is Pacino, the role of the Devil is also nicely scripted.  You kinda think that this is what Satan would really be like - just one of the guys, really.  A guy who knows what he wants and goes gets it, all with a perfect contempt for the Almighty.  After all, as they noted in 'Bedazzled' (another source of much of the Satan portrayal here), God won't even let you undress in private.Unfortunately, surrounding Pacino is...well, nothing.  Mr. Reeves is his normal enigmatic obtuse, emotionally bland self. Nothing is really conveyed of the character other than that he's a self-centered jerk.  Which, granted, is kinda Satan's point in the first place. The rest of the characterization is...eh.  Characters come, characters go, characters brutally die.  Naked women cavort before us, which I can kinda get into, but it doesn't really contribute much.  And what's with the demon faces?  Is Satan possessing them?  Have they given themselves over to Satan? What has Mary Ann got that lets her see these 'faces'?And the ending...arrgh.  A 100% copout.  I thought this kind of stuff went out with 'Dallas,' but no such luck.  There's a (mild) twist at the very end.  Basically, they might as well have had Keanu click his ruby slippers together and say, 'There's no place like home.'Overall, because I'm big on the whole good/evil God/Satan dichotomy, I gave this a marginal 'thumbs up.'  But catch any given episode of 'Brimstone' (yeah, right, after Fox cancelled it in Spring '99) and you can see much the same thing.",6,1,4,24 April 1999
Gremlins," Another Great Dante Flick
","Joe Dante seems to have some connection directly into my head, as his films never fail to entertain me.  Gremlins is no exception, as it basically parodies the old Universal horror flicks, monster movies in general, small town movies and plays like Our Town, and throws in a whole lot in-jokes and sight gags as well (see Trivia).  The Gremlins remain to this day the most grotesquely loveable 'monsters' in screen history.",8,0,1,15 April 1999
Unbreakable," If you don't like comic books...
","...you're probably not going to like Unbreakable.  It's that simple. Unless you like good-vs-evil dichotomy-exploring flicks (yeah, like those are just overwhelming the public these days). Unbreakable is basically a Watchmen-type exploration of what 'superheroes' would really be like, and how they come down to us through myth and (urban) legend.  The movie is basically a two man show between Willis and Jackson, and they're both up for the job.",7,0,0,27 December 2000
Batman Returns," Like Batman, I'm dichotimatically torn...
","...by Batman Returns.  On the one hand, there's a good story here (Bruce Wayne sympthasizing with both the Penguin and Catwoman, and even Schreck's concern for his son gives him a sympathetic moment or two), an interesting Biblical motif, some good fight sequences which help to maintain the image of Michael Keaton as the Batman, and some generally interesting elements throughout.On the other hand, Keaton seems to think he's in a comedy movie, playing almost all of his Wayne sequences for laughs.  He was blown off the screen by Nicholson's performance in the first movie:  this time around he's blown off the screen by three less-powerful actors/actresses overacting in concert.And _oh_ do they overact.  When Christopher Walken is the most subdued bad guy in any movie, you know you're in trouble.  The Penguin isn't so much Dickensian as disgusting as he eats raw fish, bleeds black, and bites off noses.  Pfeiffer goes too overly humorous as Kyle, too overly aggressive as Catwoman.  These are the comic book characters reinterpreted and stripped down to their _very_ basic elements.  I don't mind that they're different from their comic book counterparts, but they're (ironically) much more two-dimensional than their four-color equivalents.Meanwhile, with Keaton struggling against his overacting villainous counterparts, everyone else gets short shrift.  Michael Gough is the only other character to remain at all noticeable.  Gordon and Chip Schreck are mildly memorable, but can you really picture anyone else in this movie a day after you've watched it (except for SNL actress Jan Hooks, and maybe the memorably icy Poodle Lady)?  There's really just too much going on here, ending with a big penguin missle-launching blowout.The second in the franchise, BR remains somewhat entertaining.  But it's big, flashy throw-everything-we've-got-and-hope-it- sticks approach is a predecessor to the Schumacher 'epics' that are to come.",6,2,4,12 April 1999
Blade," Buffy without the Angst
","Wesley Snipes is unrelentingly stone-faced throughout this whole effort, leaving us with N'Bushe Wright to give us someone to root for and a audience point-of-view person.  It's technically a very proficient movie, but it tosses a lot out at you and the two vampire hunters (Blade and Whistler) aren't portrayed as likeable enough to really engage our interest.  The vampires are more interesting characters.  Although I'm still not sure exactly how you are 'born' a vampire. The finale is a bit of a let down:  La Magra is a god who... makes the main bad guy's eyes glow red and makes him hard to kill.  Not exactly the vampiric apocalypse that was promised throughout.  The Buffy TV series does it with a bit more style.",Null,0,2,8 September 1998
The Thing," For Suspense, This Can't Be Beat
","The Thing is literally painful to watch at times, much in the way that the original Alien is.  You know that pretty much nobody is going to get out alive.  The script doesn't even bother to offer the hope of an out - the characters are doomed and they know it.  In some ways, that makes it a better movie than Alien:  there's no escape pod and little expectation that the beautiful woman will get killed.  Like the Alien crew, these people aren't paid to confront the unknown, or really know or care anything about it.  It's better than the original, which I never found that interesting anyway.",8,0,1,15 January 1999
Pitch Black," Okay concept expanded to good movie
","Pitch Black isn't really a classic, but it takes a basic science fictionscenario that's been done to death since Alien in a lot of low-grade B- and Z-movies, and makes it a fairly high-budget decent production with good characterization of most of the players. van Diesel is the definite star and a definite anti-hero (not a villain, really, although people often confuse the two). The rest of the cast isn't really that well developed, and there are some gaps in characterizations (Johns in particular is never really drawn convincingly enough to explain his eventual betrayal).The alien monsters are well-done, although one wonders why the evolved a sensitivity to light on a light-intense planet. There are some other plot holes, such as the fact that the original colony had lights that weren't solar-powered: how'd they all get killed? And sometimes the characters can move around quite easily.  Riddick gets from the cave to the colony pretty easily with no lights, and Fry does the same with one puny little light. And they both get _back_ to the cave. But on the way back with Imam and Jackie they have no end of problems.Still, the movie moves along at a pretty good clip, and there's no character so weak that it really flaws apart. Overall, I'd recommend it to fans of the genre.  It's more action-adventure and horror with sci-fi trappings, though.",8,0,0,26 March 2001
Duck Soup," The Best Comedy Ever?
","Debatably the best Marx movie, although I rank Night at the Opera very close.  This is the kind of thing they should do today, but the closest we get are the Airplane/Police Squad/Hot Shots movies.",9,1,2,17 August 1998
Die Hard 2," It's No Die Hard 1...
","...but other than that, there's very little going against the second in the series.  It helps (but not enough) that the character realizes he's basically in a sequel.  There are some minor variations in the formula, but basically the movie relies on the Bruce Willis' charisma and humor, and elaborate action sequences.  William Sadler is okay, but no Alan Rickman (or Jeremy Irons in #3).  It's still enjoyable, though.",8,68,105,18 December 1998
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Generally enjoyable, but surprising it does well in America
","I have to admit, I'm surprised this movie is so popular in America. It's a very non-Occidental flick. I enjoyed it, however. There was a deep passionate romance, and a more restrained one. I typically found the main characters interesting.My main problems is that _some_ of the flying/fighting sequences did look rather weird, particularly early on. When the defiance of gravity is used in conjunction with martial arts, it is excellent. When it's simply characters pointing their arm out Superman-style and flying through the air it looks a bit goofier.Also, the desert flashback in the middle does tend to drag on a bit, bringing the movie to a grinding halt after about ten minutes.But generally I enjoyed the various characters and found the plot engaging enough. There isn't really one 'central' plot, and I'm not convinced they intermesh the various threads as well as they could have. Still, I would recommend it.",7,0,0,16 April 2001
Event Horizon," *yawn*
","Despite an excellent cast, impressive visuals, and a huge F/X budget, Event Horizon (essentially Hellraiser in space) ultimately goes nowhere.  The plot doesn't make much sense in spots  and the inner fears of the crew are never really explored in any but the most peripheral of ways.  Overall, a disappointment.",Null,1,4,18 August 1998
The Evil Dead," It's...well, a Horror Movie
","Evil Dead has some off-beat horror.  But Bruce Campbell really doesn't come to the foreground until the back half of the movie.  Much more horror than comedy, and unless you're looking for the Raimi Trademarks in this early film of his, you'd be hard put to distinguish ED from many other 'evil spirits possessing bodies and killing others' movie of the era (like The Evil).  It's a good horror movie, but not a spectacular one.",7,1,2,15 March 1999
There's Something About Mary," Weird caractiures (sic), but fun ones....
","These people (hopefully!) don't exist in real life.  They're all incredibly overdrawn and overdone (Matt Dillon in particular).  But at least they're not stupid or clueless, unlike the folks in Dumb and Dumber and Kingpin. The characters seem just close enough to 'real' that the audience can sympathize with them.That, and the Farrellys hit on some real painful moments that men at least can sympathize with (the penis in the zipper, the fishhook in the mouth).Other than that, funny, tasteless movie.  If you don't like that kind of stuff, then this isn't the movie for you.  But it seems to have a bit more 'heart' than the other Farrely movies.",8,0,0,22 December 1999
Total Recall," Talk About a Schizoid Movie!
","Like The Running Man, an original concept is taken and bent pretty seriously to make a Schwarzenegger action flick.  The parallels between the movies are uncanny.  In both, the basically-written scenario of a fairly normal Average Joe  thrust into a bizarre situation beyond his control...is turned into a hugely muscled supra-man blowing away folks left right and center.  When TR forgets that it is a Ahnald flick it's actually pretty entertaining and intellectually engaging.  But then the producers remember who their star is, and throw in some gratuitous violence and standard Ahnald one-liners.  But the mind games aspects are few and far between.  The casting is well done - Ironside, Cox, and Stone are great villains, and even underrated folks like Roy Brocksmith and Michael Champion get their moments.  But don't go in expecting a great s.f. movie.",6,0,1,19 March 1999
Hercules," Not for purists...
","...but this is Hercules in the 90's what is?  It's Disney, for pete's sake! Like Raimi, Tapert and Sorbo are doing any better over on Legendary Journeys??  And are there really that many Greek God purists out there?Hercules is a fun kid movie, with enough sly humor, in-jokes and adult-ish plot developments to keep the parents interested.  James Woods is the standout here, in the comedic role of his career.  Tate Donovan is kinda bland (like most Disney male heroes).  I wasn't that impressed by Danny DeVito doing...well, Danny DeVito.  Everyone else is competent or a bit better.There are a few plot holes: why does Zeus have trouble defeating the Titans the second time around - how'd he do it originally?  Doesn't Hades _ever_ check up on his (obviously incompetent) henchmen?  Hades seems rather...Satan-like, what with the soul-trading and deals and stuff.I thoroughly enjoyed the musical score is enjoyable throughout, though. The Muses struck me as a bit over the top (and why do they keep talking about the 'gospel' truth? - that's a Biblical reference.).  I'd rather have heard the characters sing (and shouldn't Hades have got a number?), then hear the (literal) Greek Chorus chipping in from time to time.Generally, though, it's an enjoyable flick, somewhat of a return to form for Disney after Pocahontas and Hunchback.",8,2,3,14 June 1999
Army of Darkness," If You Think AoD is Horror...
","...you're sorely mistaken.  AoD is a throwback (and a parody, much as Monty Python & The Holy Grail is ) of the big box-office epics of stuff like Excalibur.  The 'horror' elements are basically relatively insignificant, and AoD effortlessly parodies fantasy action/adventure f;ocls by transposing a modern-day man into medieval times (much like A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court).  The first two Evil Deads are basically an excuse for this movie, so don't look for any real continuity either in plot or Ash's characterization.  You can see the seeds of Raimi's revisionist/historical Hercules/Xena here, whether in the non-existent nod to historical accuracy, or the goofy fight scenes.",9,11,22,15 March 1999
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Irons + Jackson don't equal Good Sequel
","Only the presence of those two actors save DH 3 from being a rehash of the previous two movies.  Yes, in a way it's a direct sequel to the first movie (rather than the remake that was DH2).  But it's basically the same 'things are not what they seem' scam of the first two movies:  the vengeance subplot is a triviality at best and probably the most entertaining part of the movie.  Willis' character does need an active partner, and Jackson fills the role admirably, but he's about the only saving grace.  That, and Irons' twist on the 'you killed my brother' revenge plot.  It's entertaining, but I'm not sure there's anything that really could have saved it without a total rewrite and going into new territory story-wise.",7,1,2,18 December 1998
Kingpin," It's Okay...
","I wasn't that impressed by the movie.  There were certainly funny moments, but sometimes they went for obvious laughs (i.e., Munson's hand coming off during his opening frame in Reno), where you can see it's coming and it's _still_ not funny.  Bill Murray and Randy Quaid seem to be having fun overacting, but Vanessa Angel is pretty much a non-entity, demonstrating here why Weird Science - The TV Show is probably going to be the pinnacle of her career.  Harrelson basically plays an unlikeable bastard.It also strikes me that the ending is somewhat flawed.  Even in most slob-type comedy movies, isn't there a requirement that the bad guy get his comeuppance?  The only 'triumph' of the climax we're so divorced from that through most of the movie that there's no impact when we find out about it.When the gags click, they're very funny.  The whole Amish community sequence in the beginning is hilarious.  However, there's an awful lot of blank space or duds between the gags that do work.Overall, Kingpin is relatively funny, but it's not as insightful as Ferris Bueller, nor does it spit out the gags the way that Airplane! does.",6,0,1,21 June 1999
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Still One of the Best...
","Despite the pale sequels and imitations that have since followed, Freddy Kruger remains in this, his first appearance, an actual scary, ruthless dream avatar, without the devotion to F/X and one-liners of the later works.  This is considered a classic by many, and deservedly so.",Null,0,0,1 September 1998
Cube," It's a 90 minute Twilight Zone episode
","And if you like TZ, that's all well and good.  There's no real explanation for the goings-on (only a vague X-Files type conspiracy theory), but not a lot of TZ episodes stood up to rational analysis either.You do have to wonder who built this thing, since other than the Cube itself, nothing seems particularly 'futuristic'.There are a few questionable premises.  The implication is that the characters all have skills that contribute to their escape.  Well, first of all the doctor doesn't.  Secondly...this implies this is a deliberate test that particular characters with particular skills were all placed together. But then we're led to believe the whole thing is random.  So...which is it?There are also some minor nits, like who cleans up all of the many (presumably) bodies that have gone before?  Why does no one clean up Rennes' body, so that it is left behind as a plot point?Some of the math seemed a little shaky to me.  And I wasn't too impressed with the math whiz.  She has to look at a three-digit even number for a couple of second to figure out it isn't prime.  Ummm, hon, if it ends in an even number, it can't be prime.  If it ends in a '5', it can't be prime either, but she actually has to stare at it for a couple of seconds to figure this out??The characters themselves, however, are interesting enough, given that we're not seeing them in the best possible light.  Maurice de Wint, an underrated Canadian actor, probably gives the best overall performance.  His switchover to savagery is a little too abrupt (one second he's saving the doc, the next he drops her) for my tastes.  And the writers can't resist giving him a Jason-like 'return from the dead' sequence.The other characters are an interesting lot.  I wasn't impressed with deBoer (but her 'talents' on DS9 often escaped me as well), but David Hewlett is perfect.Overall, Cube is not your typical film, so going into it expecting a happy ending is probably not a good idea.  It does make you think, though, although its most important issues (Kazam's final escape) are not spoken.",8,9,16,20 July 1999
Beetlejuice," A Great Black Comedy
","While Michael Keaton is the 'name draw' despite his character's relatively small screen-time (and as he cuts loose in one of these occasional 'insane' roles that Keaton likes to take on), the real focus is on the rest of the cast.  Baldwin and Davis are great as the bewildered ghosts, Ryder is great, and Jones and O'Hara (often overlooked) are great comedy actors.  There's a kind of 'anything goes' attitude to the whole thing, giving Beetlejuice's antics a Robin Williams-sort of improvisational air (how would Williams have played the part)?  Keaton is still great though:  he doesn't even bother to try make his character likeable, but just kind of sweeps you along.",8,1,2,20 January 1999
Evil Dead II," A Rack for Sam Raimi...
","...to put his off-beat brand of humor on sums up Evil Dead 2.  Basically it's a Bruce Campbell vehicle, as his lantern-jawed hero (is it just me, or does Campbell look like Jay Leno's brother?) stumbles through incredibly gruesome and hilarious encounters with the Deadites.  Actually, ED2 does tend to drag in spots while Ash is alone in the cabin, but picks up a bit once a new batch of cannon fodder...I mean, the rest of the cast show up. Overdoes itself intentionally to excess as a parody of the blood n' gore of both the original Evil Dead and horror movies in general.",8,2,3,15 March 1999
