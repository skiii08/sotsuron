Requiem for a Dream," For me this is the best film ever made
","I don't know too much about film. I have seen many, but haven't studied them in detail or produced any myself. Perhaps a typical viewer? For me this movie is my personal favourite. If I had to choose regardless of genre, this is the one. No other movie has shaken me so much in such a way. It is the one film where I can't find any flaws. The story is perfect, it is told filmatically with excellence, the music is among the best film music I have heard, and the actors impress me massively. Each part wouldn't necessarily win an Oscar (though I believe they would have deserved it), but they all work seamlessly together, creating av overall perfectly told story that everyone should experience.",10,1,2,5 October 2006
