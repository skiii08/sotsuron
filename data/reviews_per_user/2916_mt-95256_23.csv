It," Excellent, terrifying and one of the best horrors of all time. Expect a nail-biting, scary story as well as a sweet coming-of-age story
","Often when you look at click-bait lists of 'Top 50 Horror Films Of All Time', you see the same films listed over and over; 'Nightmare on Elm Street', 'The Shining', 'Dawn of the Dead' and 'The Exorcist'. This is why it's so refreshing to see a new film with the potential to jump straight to the top of these lists. Over the last few years we haven't had many; Insidious and The Conjuring perhaps, but the amount of new entries is limited. Ever since the first trailer dropped like a bomb on the internet, there's been an inescapable hype circling It. Now it's finally here, it's a relief to see that the hype wasn't for nothing and, even more fortunately, It deserves a special seat in any Top Horror list.One thing left out of the marketing was that this is only the first film, something that's only revealed at the end. It's only to be expected; King's original novel is too long to fit an average 2 hours; also most films nowadays that enjoy any hype or success inevitably become franchises – especially when something like It becomes a record-breaking success scoring an impressive estimated $117 million on its opening weekend.Although the prospect of having yet another franchise to keep up with is worth a groan, this film isn't an irritatingly shameless attempt at building a world no one knows if they want (like with The Mummy earlier this year). Despite leaving questions open and unanswered at the end (thus requiring the second film), this film would otherwise be a strong film able to stand on its own, without a franchise behind it. Fortunately they didn't cram the whole book into one film since it would lose a lot of its strength – a great aspect of the film is the pacing, details and insights we get into each and every character. Still, this doesn't mean that the story within the film is flawless. Whilst we all understand that many questions posed at the end will be answered in the sequel, it does seem initially underwhelming and annoying not to give us any answers at the end. In the finale we find out what Pennywise has been up to, all of it not quite seeming straightforward – and then it's over, without giving us any clue to ponder on while we wait for the upcoming chapter. The end does get a bit ridiculous to be honest; the idea of a group of young children being able to confront a supposedly powerful, murderous monster begs belief.These issues towards the end aside, however, this film tells the story of Stephen King's novel excellently and with terrific pace. It's as much a coming-of-age story as it is a horror, with the director and writers allowing as much time for us to get to know the kids as they do for the scares. We don't just see a whole story revolving around Pennywise; if anything Pennywise is just the catalyst that causes the group's bond to become so strong – the real story is about the end of childhood and coming to terms with our fears. This theme and message comes across organically. The story of the group is often sweet and funny – it's not all dark and scary, oft-times coming across like a Spielberg film, Super 8 or Stranger Things. The real strength of the children is really down to the actors. Child actors can sometimes be a gamble, especially if the whole film revolves around them and it's not a movie for children. Yet any gamble here certainly pays off, since every young actor in this film is terrific and worthy of every ounce of praise they get. Having a balance between delightful, nostalgic scenes of childhood and sinister scenes of horror has a double effect; it gives us a variety of strong, rounded characters performed by hugely talented young actors to make up an excellent ensemble and the scary scenes become even more potent by contrast.It's these scary scenes that initially draw such a huge audience and they deliver the scares in spades. Mature and well-shot, there are scenes here soon to become iconic, their film techniques studied for decades to come. There are some jump scares, but they are good, satisfying and never cheap, rather the tension is built up to a wonderful climax in each horror-imbued scene. Excellent horror- cinematography aside though, Skarsgård's Pennywise is the real horror star. A perfect successor to Tim Curry's iconic original in 1990, there should be as much credit given to the design and make-up behind the clown as there is to Skarsgård's performance. Creepy and sinister with an unnerving smile one minute, then, with just a small change of facial expression, the next minute the monster within becomes obvious and absolutely terrifying. Neither underused or overused, Pennywise is certainly the hideous joy that delivers what everyone wanted from this film – an irrational phobia of clowns.The film also takes advantage of the various scares that chase the children. If clowns don't give you the shivers, then something here will. The range of scare means no specific fear becomes boring and overseen. The film also goes one step further in bringing horror from the parents of the group. Sinister and perverted, there's more than just a vicious clown on the loose and the dark aspects coming from the children's very homes make it all the more captivating and unnerving.Whether clowns scare you or not, this is without doubt a horror film that you need to see. Sinister, tense and undeniably terrifying with an intricate, scary plot, it's also sweet, innocent and very funny with a nostalgic and thought-provoking insight into childhood. The scares are big and enjoyable and Pennywise is the horror icon we all want. Everyone's favourite dancing clown is back to float this movie to a success and you should want to float too.",8,4,10,11 September 2017
Hereditary," A Masterful Nightmare You'll Never Forget
","TL;DR<ul><li>Incredible for a directorial debut from Ari Aster</li><li>Unforgettable in all the good (and horrifying) ways</li><li>Slow start that reveals a well-developed plot</li><li>Includes one of the most shocking and unpredictable scenes in cinema</li><li>Eternal sense of dread - horror throughout the entire film</li><li>Doesn't need to rely on cheap jump-scares</li><li>Brilliant performances from whole cast</li></ul>When a trailer can proudly boast that a film is 'from the producer of The Witch' (presumably referring to producer Lars Knudsen), that's more than impressive enough credentials to lure in even the most discerning horror fan. Though many may not have seen The Witch, it definitely made an impression, provoking a lot of talk about it. Hereditary is similar; it's absolutely not for everyone... but it's impossible not to talk about it, let alone forget it. Even more incredible for a directorial debut, Ari Aster has created a horror masterpiece that will provoke nightmares for generations to come.As has been made clear by some disgruntled audiences (for whom I admit having an ounce of contempt), it is rather slow to get going - but that's not to say it's ever boring. On the contrary, one accolade Hereditary can be proud of is that it is never dull. It starts more like a drama about a family learning to deal with the passing of a family-member, but it's only when the horror really kicks in that we start to see the film's fantastically well-crafted story. Even before this point though, there is a sinister undertone; a threatening atmosphere that never lets you feel comfortable or safe. Once the horror plot starts to take shape, it's enjoyable to discover the little pieces of information, only really allowing you to understand at the very end. In fact, at the end there is a line which is a little too on-the-nose, explicitly explaining the plot for anyone who fell asleep half-way through. But it's a well-developed plot that may be light on jump scares, but is heavy on everything else. The U-turn is unforgettable, sticking in my mind as one of the most shocking and unpredictable scenes in cinema.There's a reason Hereditary is being hailed as this generation's The Exorcist. There are several moments in The Exorcist which have gone down in cinematic history; running down the stairs backwards, the spinning head, the act with the crucifix... to name just a few! Several shocking, even chilling and downright terrifying, moments are found throughout Hereditary, especially at the end. Not to say that there are no scares until then; an eternal sense of dread lasts throughout the film and culminates in pure terror. A little silhouette in the corner of the screen that different members of the audience will notice, gasps of shock rippling through the auditorium; countless decapitations; enigmatic moments that will haunt your dreams. Hereditary is a sophisticated horror, not needing to rely on cheap jump scares to terrify. The music is used brilliantly too, able to heighten tension at just the right time.The cast really sell it too. Even with a small one of just four or five main characters, they all pull their weight. Despite irritating crying throughout, Alex Wolff contributes more than in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle; a noticeably different character at the end, Wolff's Peter is the unsung protagonist of the film. One scene in particular, involves him just sitting at the wheel of a car for an endlessly long time, all his character's emotions and thoughts easily legible from just his face and eyes. Byrne's Steve takes a while for his character to really become layered and interesting, but when all hell breaks loose and only Annie and Peter are aware, you don't know whether to feel sorry or frustrated with him. However, it's Toni Collette and Milly Shapiro who really steal the show. The fact that, along with director Aster, this is Shapiro's first film is astounding. Even without the disconcerting make-up, Shapiro's performance is the very definition of creepy - but the film wouldn't be the same without her. Collette's Annie's slow descent into madness is where the film really comes alive though. It's a steady progression and every look and line can be read in various ways. You'll feel sorry for her until you're terrified of her.There are some horrors, like the recent Truth or Dare or the seemingly unending series of Purge films, where I think it's a tacky genre watched by people who don't really want great films. But every now and then comes a film that saves the whole genre; A Quiet Place, Get Out, It... even Mother! if you count that as a horror (and I certainly do)... and of course Hereditary. This has everything you could want from a sophisticated horror - enough jump-scares to keep it entertaining, an eternal sense of discomfort and dread, shocking twists, a constant mystery and a terrifying climax - and all this from a feature-length directorial debut. Whatever comes next for Aster, let's hope it inherits the quality of this film.",8,1,2,29 June 2018
Darkest Hour," A Big V for Victory!
","TL;DR<ul><li>One of the year's strongest biopics</li><li>Narrow scope works very well, focusing on just a month and so giving so much detail</li><li>Informative and enjoyable</li><li>Excellent performances from the supporting cast</li><li>Brilliant set decoration, cinematography and direction</li><li>Witty, well-paced writing, though occasionally heavy and exhausting</li><li>The Oscar is absolutely deserved for Oldman (and the make-up) - an incredible performance</li></ul>----------------------------------Every year it seems we can expect at least one Oscar-nominated film recounting the life of a historical figure (this year we have two, Darkest Hour and I, Tonya). These aren't confined to one season, however, and there are numerous biopics coming out all the time. Not all of these are a hit, many being critically panned. However some biopics lauded, both by critics and audiences alike; Darkest Hour is one of these films, instantly becoming an example for the biopic genre in general, largely due to its focus, managing to mix story, struggles, history and personality seamlessly.While many biopics try (often in vain) to chart the life of a great figure from birth to death, Darkest Hour instead narrows its scope to a crucial, captivating month in the life of its protagonist. Churchill is a fascinating character and to tell the whole story of his life in just one film is too big a challenge to really do the man justice. Instead we go on an often intimate journey with him and his early struggles, many of which a great deal of the audience will not be aware of. Personally I had no idea that Churchill experience so much criticism and doubt even by members of his own party. Since there's a lot of history to learn as we watch, heavy expositionary dialogue is almost inevitable. At times such intense and heavy conversations packed full of information can become exhausting and one might find their mind wondering slightly, in need of some light relief. This relief isn't provided often, but that's not to say the film is devoid of comedy. In fact, Oldman's performance of Churchill himself gives us a great deal of comedy to lighten the tone and really improve the overall personality of the film. Still, even when there's a lot of serious discussions going on, it's never dull and always well-written, not getting too bogged down in the dreary and unnecessary details. The moments when we see the full personality of Churchill come through is when the film shines and Anthony McCarten's script perfectly captures the image of the man about whom we hear so many stories. However this is mostly down to Gary Oldman.Oldman is certainly the heart and soul of Darkest Hour. Even if we were to forget the make-up, his performance is outstanding; but with the Academy Award-winning make-up it's incredible how he is transformed and how successfully he embodies Churchill and brings him to life before our very eyes. This is all best seen in a scene that probably never happened in real life - Churchill heads on into the London Underground by himself, astonishing the passengers and chatting with them all. This is Oldman's Oscar-winning performance at its finest; story is temporarily forgotten, and it's an absolute to joy to watch him just be that character, disbelief absolutely suspended, either willingly or unwillingly. Though Gary Oldman certainly seizes the film, the supporting cast support very well. Mendelsohn takes a different approach to King George than Colin Firth, making this character seem more his own, and Pickup and Dillane are perfect as stuffy politicians. Yet it's Scott Thomas and James that are the strongest in the supporting cast, giving both Churchill and the film a strong, kind and womanly touch that the overly male-dominated film needs.Director Joe Wright and director of photography Bruno Delbonnel also include gorgeous aesthetics. The set decoration is sublime, fully immersing us into a WWII London and letting it come to life. More than this, it's all shot beautifully and sometimes theatrically, with some of its cinematography inspiring. These all come together to strongly emphasise either the isolation or the triumph Churchill feels at different points throughout his story.It's obvious from all the talk and even the poster that this is Gary Oldman's film. It's important to remember though that there's so much more to enjoy and applaud. With excellent writing, directing and cinematography, an emotional and realistic WWII London is brought to life, supported by an excellent cast. This is all topped off by an incredibly transformed Gary Oldman, fully evoking Churchill and giving us the performance of a lifetime. A big V for Victory!",8,2,5,11 March 2018
Deadpool 2," Bigger, Better, Bolder. Maximum Laughs and Action.
","TL;DR<ul><li>Beat the sequel curse - better than the first one</li></ul><ul><li>Better story with more heart</li></ul><ul><li>Story takes a surprising direction</li></ul><ul><li>Not bogged down in origin stories</li></ul><ul><li>Plenty of jokes and references, never falling short on comedy</li></ul><ul><li>As much a comedy as it is a superhero film</li></ul><ul><li>Breathtaking, exciting action sequences</li></ul><ul><li>Humanises Deadpool more</li></ul><ul><li>Returning and new characters all a joy, but never steal the light from Reynolds</li></ul><ul><li>Best post-credits scene yet (yes, even better than MCU)</li></ul>------------------------------------------------Despite the wide variety of characters in Marvel comics, Deadpool has always been a unique; the Merc with a Mouth has won the hearts of comic fans worldwide and more recently the hearts of film fans too with 2016's Deadpool. The first film was an excellent portrayal of the character, Reynolds proving the perfect choice for playing the inimitable Wade Wilson. Hopes were naturally very high for the sequel, but, as with all follow-ups, there was a worry that it wouldn't live up to the original; that it would perhaps go too far or be just a rehash of what we've seen before. Fortunately, that's not the case - if anything, Deadpool 2 is better than its predecessor, with a better story, more characters and much more references and humour. Still, although this film succeeds on every level, it still struggles to be quite as unique and memorable as the titular character himself.The story in Deadpool 2 is hugely better and more entertaining than the previous one, jumping straight in with full-on Deadpool action and leading on to a genuinely engaging narrative. Unlike the first, this one doesn't have the handicap of being bogged down in an origin story. This results in a better story with much more heart and more even more comedy. In fact, the story takes a fairly surprising turn, taking us in an unpredictable direction. Despite the sheer volume of promotion for this film, it's commendable that much of its plot details were not leaked ahead of time. As much as it mocks fellow superhero films, in this respect it's an improvement on Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, a film that was famously criticised for giving away the main antagonist at the end as well as the inclusion of Wonder Woman.On top of this, it has a different feel to a lot of other superhero films and comes across as notably fresh even in an already saturated genre dominated by the MCU. A lot of this has to do with how Deadpool is different and how humour is at the heart of both the character and the film. There are plenty of references which can make anyone laugh, particularly film and comic fans though. It takes a certain boldness for a film to ridicule itself, but it definitely works to its advantage here. There's even wise-cracking and jokes in the middle of intense action scenes, never falling short on laughs. These jokes make the otherwise breathtaking and exciting fight scenes that much more enjoyable. It's just as much a comedy as it is a superhero film, arguably even funnier than most comedy films released. This is precisely what we need in this genre, making Deadpool 2 stand out even though coming out just weeks after record breaking superhero film Avengers: Infinity War.Since wise-cracking and comedy is at the heart of Deadpool's character himself, it then comes as no surprise that this is without a doubt Ryan Reynolds' film. Once more completely throwing himself into the role, he's proven himself yet again to be perfect as Deadpool. This film managed to give him a chance to humanise the character, giving us a more emotional Wade amongst the ceaseless joking. Not that our titular hero gets edgy at all - that duty is served perfectly by newcomer Josh Brolin. Even though we've just seen him as Thanos, he makes an excellent adversary to Deadpool as Cable (although he's still called Thanos once in one of many great one-liners), with a large heart underneath the gruff, rugged persona. Another newcomer, Zazie Beetz also fits in very well as an opposite to Deadpool, rolling her eyes at all his jokes and quips, often effortless managing to steal the spotlight in some of the action scenes. Julian Dennison too is very welcome in his role, only his comedy talents seem slightly underused - still, he's gone from Hunt for the Wilderpeople to a more mainstream film. Hopefully this is a step in the right direction for a up and coming star. Other supporting characters return fresh-faced and excited to continue, but they never manage to steal the spotlight from Reynolds.Anyone who enjoyed the first film is guaranteed to enjoy the second. Everything that we liked from the former returns, this time bigger and better; more story, more characters, more action, more laughs, more heart - think Avengers was the only excellent superhero film this year? Think again. It's almost as if Black Panther was a starter, Avengers was the main, Deadpool 2 is dessert, and Ant-Man and the Wasp will be coffee. Not only is it impressive for Deadpool to stand among the MCU titans, but dessert has never been so fun.",8,6,14,1 June 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Packed with Marvel references, gorgeous action and more genuine laughs than most comedies, Thor: Ragnarok is an absolute blast!
","After a total of seventeen films in less than ten years, it's pretty safe to say that Marvel has safely established itself as a popular, successful franchise with its own identity. Known for comedy, references to its other films and comics, and epic, fun action, every Marvel film is at least enjoyable. However, there are some that peak; some that can be included in the best Marvel films - and sometimes best films in the superhero genre. Films like this are the first Avengers, The Winter Soldier, Civil War, Guardians of the Galaxy - and also Thor: Ragnarok. Definitely a highlight so far in the Marvel anthology, Thor: Ragnarok is one of the best, delivering everything you want and expect with a little bit more, brimming with fun, personality and action.Anyone who's seen director Taika Waititi's vampire-comedy mockumentary What We Do in the Shadows will likely expect his inimitable and delightful brand of humour to extend to his Marvel entry (perhaps they've learned since getting rid of Edgar Wright from Ant-Man). It's fortunate that he kept his comedy as it really delivers and fits in well with the comedic personality that Marvel has crafted itself; some of their best films are also, by no coincidence, also the funniest (something DC fails with) and Waititi has continued this trend, while keeping the laughs fresh and genuinely funny. Not that this is a out-and-out comedy - not all the jokes are intended to make you laugh out loud; but they never feel forced and all lend themselves to the personality of the film (and the franchise) and really maximise the fun we have watching the movie. After all, this is a film about a traditional Norse God as a superhero fighting alongside a big, angry, green rage monster - it's important to have fun with it!'Fun' is certainly one of the best words to describe Thor: Ragnarok and it doesn't extend to just the laughs. Other enjoyable elements include references to the wider MCU to excite geeks and non-geeks alike. They all fit in well and seamlessly, not a shoehorned, forced reference or cameo; they all seem organic and make sense to the plot. It's delightful to see Dr Strange, even just for one scene, and to be able to spy glimpses of the Tesseract and a fake Infinity Gauntlet. These add to the rewatch value in a few years time.The crazy, kinetic action really does extend to the whole of the film, from beginning to end, each sequence excellently choreographed. It doesn't shy away from its roots from comics as some of the fights are just as delightfully eccentric and over-the- top. Still they never cease to entertain and, more than that, some are just stunning to behold; the flashback to Valkyrie battling Hela the first time, her army atop a hoard of winged horses soaring through an orange sky only to be cut down by swords and spikes flying towards them in slow- motion. These are gorgeous scenes and Waititi and cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe should be proud; the beauty of some of Zack Snyder's superhero moments, but in a good film with much more personality.Most of this movie's joy lies in its characters though; at the end of the day, it might be funny and the action might look cool, but if we don't love the characters, we won't love the film. Back again we get the usual ensemble of returning characters - Thor, Loki, Odin and Heimdall. All are as regal, fun and charismatic as ever, Hemsworth and Hiddleston in particular; it's wonderful to see these actors develop their characters over the last few films into lovable parts in a franchise full of heroes we already love. I feel Hopkins deserved a little more screen time and a chance to get more emotional, but, ever the professional, he makes the most with what he has (and is exceptionally good as Loki pretending to be Odin). Returning characters from elsewhere in the MCU Dr Strange and Hulk also add to the delightful ensemble; it's nice to see Strange solidifying his presence in the franchise after just one film (particularly when comparing to Tony Stark having been in six so far, not including post-credit cameos). It's a relief too to finally give Hulk a decent amount of screen time and for us to get to know him as opposed to just Banner; they're two distinct characters within each other and it's about time we get to see more of everyone's favourite rage monster.The new characters introduced in this film are all excellent worthy additions to the Marvel roster and bring a refreshing touch with them. Tessa Thompson is excellent and charismatic as kick-ass female hero Valkyrie, able to confidently stand among Thor, Hulk and Loki. Korg may not be quite the same character he is in the comics, but Waititi takes this part (who wouldn't give themselves a minor role in the MCU if they can?!) and really makes it his own, saving lots of the quirky laughs for himself. Cate Blanchett too is a particularly fantastic villain, sure to stand amongst the best Marvel villains so far, heads and shoulders above the likes of Malekith and Ronan. She's less generic, less monologue-y and never boring; able to kick ass and be just as evilly sexy as Helena Bonham-Carter was as Bellatrix (or is that just me...?). And of course there's Jeff Goldblum who's as Jeff Goldblum as he's ever been - who doesn't love that?!Thor proves himself to be the God of Thunder and Thor: Ragnarok proves itself to be one of the Gods of Marvel, standing proud amongst the best so far. The whole movie's an absolute blast, packed with references, gorgeous action and more genuine laughs than most comedies. An excellent film to round off Marvel in 2017 - let's hope Black Panther keeps up this level of excellence.",8,85,160,29 October 2017
Ready Player One," Ready Player One - everything you could ever want from Spielberg and more!
","TL;DR<ul><li>A different sort of videogame movie - about videogames and not based on a specific one</li><li>Fun MacGuffins</li><li>Tons of videogame and film pop culture references, making it so much fun to watch</li><li>Brilliantly original and immersive world</li><li>Beautiful and stunning CGI</li><li>Electric and adrenaline-fuelled action - improved with references</li><li>Characters unlikely to become iconic, but still very likeable</li></ul>There's no way around it - Ready Player One is definitely a videogame movie; a dedicated one at that... but not in the way you might think. While most 'videogame movies' are merely adaptations of existing videogames (eg. Prince of Persia, Assassin's Creed, Doom) and mostly totally rubbish (the recent Tomb Raider aside). However, there's a smaller, less appreciated genre of videogame movies that are wildly different, in that they are instead about videogames, not based on any ones in particular, allowing for a lot more freedom; incredibly these films are often well-received and liked (something that can't be said for the Mario film). There aren't many but the few that are around have seen packed audiences and positive reviews from critics - there's Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Disney's brilliant Wreck-It Ralph and even Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, which certainly got more favourable reviews than any Resident Evil film. Now there's a new one, and Ready Player One might be the best yet. Steven Spielberg returns to fine form with an immediate classic - a more traditional story that's still utterly modern, a fun rollercoaster ride from start to finish and an absolute joyful masterpiece with references that will make repeat viewings a delight.The story isn't too dissimilar to other Spielberg adventure flick Indiana Jones, a shameless MacGuffin-led adventure, with clues and hidden meanings to the next piece of the puzzle with fights peppered throughout. As I've said before, this is my personal favourite genre and it fits very well within this film. All the trials/ games to find the keys are distinct and unique, each as exciting and action-packed as the other, crammed with film and videogame references.In fact it's these references to film and videogame pop culture over the past 40 years or so peppered throughout the film left, right and centre that make up its personality and makes it so much fun to watch. There are almost an endless number of references, though you can't fail to wish maybe there were a few more nods to other popular games - Pokemon, Zelda, even Skyrim. Regardless of how legally challenging it would be to allow these in the film, there are so many references in general that you don't really need any more, otherwise it would veer close to being too saturated and gimmicky. Instead the film is brimming with enjoyable references (Back to the Future, Overwatch, Terminator, Iron Giant, Mario, Goldeneye, Halo to name but a few off the top of my head), enough to be fun, funny and to seem real - because let's face it, if the OASIS existed we would cram it full of references to everything under the sun. It's all blended beautifully and seamlessly with the orignal world Spielberg has created with Ernest Cline, author of the novel.More than just being a load of fun, the references enrich the otherwise incredible and electric action scenes, making them varied, fun and terrifically unique. Take the final battle: in no other film could you have the protagonist firing laser blasters from a Back to the Future-styled Delorean, throwing a bloodthirsty Chucky doll into a battlefield, one side being an army led by those Halo guys and Tracer from Overwatch while Iron Giant is battling it out with mecha-Godzilla. That's just a drop in the ocean for a film like this, with such glorious action filmed only in the way a master filmmaker like Spielberg can. Even the backdrop to the action is incredible, with so much detail and still being well animated. In fact, the work that has gone into the CGI has to be applauded as it's omnipresent and is used very well, completely immersing us into an incredible world.On the other hand, though, there are no characters as iconic as, say, Indiana Jones. Whilst the designs of each avatar are brilliant, well-animated and varied, they're no match for a man with a hat and trusty whip. Still, these aren't dull characters; there's an eclectic group of great characters that are a blast to spend the runtime with. Ben Mendelsohn plays the traditional Spielberg-esque antagonist Nolan Sorrento, in a great performance oozing with villainy and malevolence. At first Mark Rylance seems rather bored with his part as OASIS creator Halliday, but when we get to know the character we can see that it was an understated, well-played part, perfectly showing us a man with limitless imagination who struggled to connect with the real world. The central duo, Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke, are strong and consistently likable, able to engage the audience both as themselves and as their avatars, with Lena Waithe being an easily amiable side-kick. Simon Pegg was underused though and it's a shame that not enough characterisation and screentime was given to the rest of the High-Five, namely Sho and Daito who remain rather unimportant characters that seem to be there just to bulk up the group.Steven Spielberg gives us an electric, exicting and visually stunning glimpse into the near future, breathing fresh life into videogame movies and Macguffin movies. This is Spielberg going back to doing the type of films we love him for - old-school Spielberg doing a modern film, with non-stop action, fun and an exhaustive list of pop culture references that means we can watch it several times and always see something new. Ready Player One is a fantastic blockbuster that's sure to blow you away. Ready Player One? More like Ready Player FIVE (stars)!",8,0,2,3 April 2018
"I, Tonya"," Margot Robbie Leads an Excellent Cast to a Gold Medal
","TL;DR<ul><li>Unique style makes it personal and stand out</li><li>Great soundtrack</li><li>Goodfellas vibe to the whole thing</li><li>Tracks a lot of Tonya's life but the focus narrows in on 'the incident', improving structure</li><li>Phenomenal performances, particularly Margot Robbie and Allison Janney in particular</li></ul>-------------------------------------------------You have to admit, I, Tonya came out at a pretty perfect time; with the Oscars just around the corner and the Winter Olympics in full swing, Margot Robbie's latest ticks both boxes with a film about ice skating worthy of its three Academy Award nominations. Bringing a sporting legend to life, I, Tonya is a well-made, strangely captivating film.The style chosen by director Craig Gillespie and writer Steven Rogers is a unique, interesting one and works very well. Starting from her childhood and tracking her life up until the present (more or less), it's absolutely a biopic, but it's given a dash of personality and realism by occasionally having the style of a documentary, with the actors recreating the real-life interviews and the editing cutting the talking-heads to fit in seamlessly with the rest of the film - the nomination for editing is well-deserved. Having the actors break the fourth wall and talk to the audience, both in the talking heads and fitting into the action, makes the story seem a lot more personal and works well, also fitting with Tonya's rebellious persona. In fact the constant personal narration (along with the fantastic soundtrack) gives off a strong Goodfellas vibe that works well.Most of the film is about the characters though, the latter half specifically being about how they react and handle the aftermath of 'the incident'. The cast are all wonderful, without a weak link. Even the comic relief in Paul Walter Hauser doesn't detract from the film's tone and is used in moderation to lighten things up. It's especially refreshing to see Sebastian Stan flex his acting talents more than we often see him in the Marvel films, with his Bucky character relegated to just brooding and not giving off much of a character. Here however he's given a chance to deliver a well-rounded, complex performance, playing a character we really shouldn't like, but Stan makes the pathetic and aggressive Jeff almost sympathetic. This complex performance extends especially to the Oscar nominated performances by Margot Robbie and Allison Janney. Robbie makes a wonderful lead, fully embracing the 'bad-girl' persona of Tonya Harding, while still making her empathetic and likeable. With such a charismatic, intricate performance, it's not surprising she's been nominated. Janney in particular is one of the most interesting characters though, easily stealing every scene she's in and really making the part her own. It would be so easy for her character to be seen as an abusive villain, but instead she makes her more complex than that. Like with all the characters, Janney's excellent performance portrays her character as neither good nor bad, neither likeable nor unlikable. She's a flawed person and is perhaps the best thing in the film.I, Tonya is nothing if not refreshing; a uniquely styled biopic which breaks the fourth wall, is effortlessly entertaining and captivates audiences worldwide with flawless performances of very flawed characters. This one easily steals a gold medal.",7,10,15,28 February 2018
Molly's Game," A Winning Hand for Aaron Sorkin's Directorial Debut
","TL;DR<ul><li>Captivating plot, but starts to run out of steam in the second half</li><li>Poker games are fun and exciting</li><li>The script is perfect, with plenty of examples of witty, snappy dialogue</li><li>Wonderful cast - particularly Elba and Chastain</li><li>A promising directorial debut</li></ul>---------------------------------Much like Tarantino, Aaron Sorkin has come to be known for his writing; impressive, snappy dialogues that have a real impact, are clever and funny and certainly add to a film's quality. However, unlike Tarantino, he's not known for his directing - yet. Confined for the most part to screenwriting, Molly's Game signifies a first for Sorkin, letting him trying his hand at directing as well as writing, something many have hoped to see for some time. So how does his directorial debut fare? On the plus side, Molly's Game is an enjoyable, well-done film that sucks you in and gives you a captivating plot with the sort of snappy and detailed script we have come to expect from this master writer. Despite this, there's still not much that lets the film stand out and be special - as you might guess, Sorkin's script stands out the most. Still, this doesn't mean he should hang up the directing hat just yet, because there's plenty to enjoy in his debut.The story is an intriguing one (especially since it's based on reality) and the writing emphasises this, really sucking you in from the beginning. But watching countless poker games and listening to complex legal jabber weighs the film down, making it run out of steam about halfway through. Though frequent, the poker games are exciting and rarely cease to be fun to watch, with Sorkin managing to make the tension on the table jump through the screen to the audience. This extends to other elements, particularly the way it's filmed and the narration by Chastain. The style and visuals are impressive for a first-time director and work very well - clearly Sorkin understands what makes film a special and unique medium. However the process of building the 'business,' while initially fun, ends up wearing thin as things get more complicated, slightly repetitive and not explained too much. On top of this, flicking back and forth from the poker games to Molly's scenes with Jaffey, complicate the narrative in an already slightly complex plot (although with a character like Jaffey being played by Elba, it's very welcome to have him peppered throughout the movie). Sorkin also certainly adds messages and a heart to his film, but this can often be lost in the end amongst the beefy plot.Despite the occasionally convoluted plot however, so long as an audience has enough attention, it's not too hard to jump back on board if you get lost. This is mostly due to fantastic writing, something we have come to expect (although still take for granted) from Sorkin. Whatever flaw that can be found in the film, can equally be made up for by witty, fast-paced writing, which embellishes the whole film and adds a tremendous amount of depth to the characters. Once again he proves himself to be one of the master bards of our generation. At times though you just want the script to slow down and relax, for us to feel comfortable and not be prepared for constant verbal jousting; it can be exhausting, especially around the point where the film begins to run out of steam.Still it's brought back to life and we're made to be constantly aware and entertained by the wonderful cast who are all on top of their game. With a decent supporting cast including the likes of Michael Cera, who seems to slowly be distancing himself from Superbad's Evan (a character he seems to play frequently), Chris O'Dowd and Kevin Costner, proving to be a much more interesting father than in Man of Steel. The centre-point of the film revolves around Idris Elba and, even more so, Jessica Chastain, who really are the heart and soul of the movie - along with the script, of course; but who knows how this script could have fared with another cast? They are both excellent and play off each other very well, their scenes with one another electric at all times. Chastain is the one who really steals the scenes though, consistently captivating to watch and apparently effortlessly showing the progression of Molly.All in all, Molly's Game is an impressive first time directing for Sorkin and shows his transition from writing to directing will hopefully be a smooth one, particularly if he can direct his own wonderful scripts. At times you can tell he consulted with friend and fellow director David Fincher (with whom he worked with for The Social Network), so I think we're yet to really see his own style and what he can really bring to the director's chair. A promising debut with a top-notch script, intriguing plot and excellent performances from the leads, Molly's Game is a winning hand.",7,0,3,12 January 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Five Stars for Three Billboards; Dark, Gritty, Funny, Thought-provoking
","TL;DR
<ul><li>An instant classic</li></ul>-Bleak, depressing but always hilarious in only the way McDonagh can be
-Excellent script from McDonagh
-Relevant, engaging story told at a perfect pace
-Incredible performances from an A* cast
-One of cinema's greatest cliffhanger endings
----------------------------Take one look at the list of nominations this awards season and you'll see a long list of excellent films, but there's one with a strange title that stands out - Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Not the sort of catchy title that studios often look out for, but writer-director Martin McDonagh is anything but ordinary, something this film certainly proves. In fact it's fortunate that the awards have picked this film up, since otherwise a film like this could have been lost. Instead, the awards buzz have given Three Billboards a certain hype. Combine that with the reputation McDonagh has gained from such excellent films as In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths (the former in particular being an all-time favourite of mine), does this film live up to the excitement? Absolutely yes. An incredible film with perfect performances and a first-class screenplay, McDonagh has given us a refreshing classic that's sure to be lauded over for years to come.Strange as the story may seem, it's oddly captivating and by no means ever boring. Despite Mildred being the protagonist, we don't necessarily just take her side as the story encompasses a range of characters in the town; we see as much of Mildred as we do aggressive cop Dixon. The story really succeeds in challenging the audience's perspective and expectations. It doesn't require a big, Hollywood-style plot; instead it's small and intimate and is all the stronger for it. This allows for a more thorough and detailed look at the characters and the effects the story has on them, making it the sort of film we need today, particularly with countless stories of sexual harassment and racial attacks we hear in the news. It's a film with a story that implicitly challenges us to question our society and helps us perhaps to see some things in a new light. Add to that the best cliffhanger ending since The Italian Job (1969) and you have a story which sticks firmly in your mind.Similar to In Bruges, another pro of its small story is that it allows the script to stand out, something very important in a McDonagh film. One of my favourite contemporary writers (his play The Pillowman is one of my absolute favourite plays), Three Billboards' script is perfectly exemplary of McDonagh's type of writing; bleak and depressing, but with plenty of dark humour peppered throughout, all the while thought provoking and challenging. More than this, his way of writing allows for strangely beautiful language, where profanity is just part of the poetry. The script is particularly good at balancing tension with constant comedy; you could be on the edge of your seat, waiting for something bad to happen, while laughing the entire time. It's a strange sense of unease that you bizarrely can't fail to enjoy.As big a fan as I am of McDonagh, however, he can't take all the credit. The casting is first-class and each cast member is excellent. Presumably McDonagh's got a thing for 'little people' since Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage takes over midget/dwarf duties, as opposed to Jordan Prentice's disgruntled actor in In Bruges. While not particularly important to the overall story, Dinklage's character's inclusion adds a nice bit of variety to the town's population and it's nice to see him play the opposite of Tyrion Lannister - mostly sober and a bit less successful with women. Still, he seemed a bit underused for such a successful actor at the moment. Abbie Cornish's Anne also doesn't seem to be given the screentime she deserves, but when her character's married to Harrelson's Willoughby, she's always going to be dwarfed by him. Harrelson is once again effortlessly likeable and 'cool' as the town's police chief, not becoming the antagonist you'd expect him to be. On the contrary, while you'd think we'd be on Mildred's side for the entire film, instead we find ourselves almost sympathising with Chief Willoughby more. Harrelson does an excellent job of balancing emotion and humour. Rockwell's Dixon is more arguably the 'antagonist' of the film if you need to apply the label somewhere, who again balances the humour in his character very well with his aggression and stupidity. He could easily have been a very detestable character, but Rockwell's portrayal is so charismatic and he progresses throughout the film's entirety to the point that our opinions and perceptions change. At the heart of the whole drama though, stony-faced and angry, is McDormand's Mildred. Playing fierce and fiery wonderfully, McDormand is the one who really sells the film and it's her character's personality that carries the film just as much as the script.If you liked In Bruges, you'd certainly like this. If you like any film with wit and comedy, you'd like this. If you like films set in a microcosm which question and reflect on our own society, you'd like this. The only problem is that there's a shame there weren't five billboards to make a five-star pun... McDonagh solidifies his talent with his third consecutive great film, this one being his best yet. With an incredible script and a perfect cast, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is an instant classic, able to challenge an audience and make them laugh the whole time.",9,2,5,16 January 2018
Justice League," There may be lots of flaws, but certainly not the disappointment we all dreaded. Fun characters, exciting set-pieces and a lighter tone. Very enjoyable!
","Comic book plots occasionally have a tendency to be slightly complex and convoluted - not in this film though. On the contrary, the plot here is so simplistic to the point where it isn't really important at all. The Mother Boxes are extreme McGuffins and when you think back on the film, the story isn't really what jumps out at you. In fact, more than that, the story is forgettable and just a bit dull. There are no twists or surprises or any fear or suspense at all. On top of this, there's a very confused structure, where in the first half it's as though the film can't decide whether it's about the world coping after Superman's death or if it's about Steppenwolf's plan to conquer the world. It all feels a bit mixed up and results in some scenes seeming out of place and boring in comparison, slowing down the pace of the film. It also feels as though the story was very light and we miss a middle. With a decent start and end, the middle does tend to waffle a bit; though there's a fun fight scene, there's not much else, resulting in a bit of a rush towards the finale. This is a shame as the middle section could really help us get to know the characters and give them room to grow – as well as improving the plot and giving it a chance to develop.As light and dull as the story is though, the fun rarely comes from its plot; the best parts without doubt lie in its action and characters. The former, however, lacks potency because there's no threat at all within the story. Yes, the fight scenes and set pieces are amazing; there's a variety of action, well-choreographed fights and a kinetic energy (especially when all characters are working together) that brings an exciting energy to the film and is a joy to watch. However there's rarely a feeling of doom when the only vulnerable characters in any danger are a rather obscure and irrelevant Russian family as token civilians who are easily saved – no one else is ever in any peril and so the stakes really don't seem particularly high.Still despite this, it really is difficult to care when the action looks this good. As with each and every Zack Snyder film, though he doesn't often make good movies, you can always count on them excelling in the eye-candy department and Justice League is no exception – this is certainly a film that deserves the full IMAX 3D experience. With impressive CGI, thrilling action set pieces and wonderful costume design (particularly for Aquaman) this is an absolute treat for the eyes and there's lots to enjoy just in aesthetics. Sadly though, it's not all good news; there are frequent scenes where the use of green screen is painfully obvious, standing out amongst all the other good CGI; and it looks like the recent controversy surrounding the more scantily clad Amazonian warriors had a right to come up – these costumes are ridiculous and nigh-on pornographic. It's a shame that while Wonder Woman took one step forward with regards to sexual equality, Justice League took two steps back.Still the highlight of the film is certainly the characters. All of them mix well, their interactions together being a high point and each of them remaining unique and interesting with their own brand of comedy. I can't help but wonder how much of the lighter tone and comedic moments were down to Snyder or Whedon who completed directing Newcomers hold their own and can easily stand next to current favourite Wonder Woman. Momoa brings a comedic version of ultra- masculinity to Aquaman which fits really well and Miller's Barry Allen is certainly the comic relief that was needed in the DCEU, fully personifying all the comic book enthusiasts in the cinema and easily encouraging a whole audience to laugh. Gadot continues being perfect as Wonder Woman, bringing so much more than her beauty to the role, but being an inspirational character that stands out. Affleck seems to be more comfortable as Batman than in his previous outings and certainly shows promise. Amy Adams as Lois Lane and J.K. Simmons as Lieutenant Gordon are criminally underused considering their talents, yet despite brief appearances they make the most of their screen-time. The only weak link in the cast is Henry Cavill who still can't hold a torch to Christopher Reeve. Too dry and wooden with only a couple of facial expressions, it's a shame we've yet to see Superman develop a personality; in comparison to his fellow teammates this stands out as a stark contrast. If anything, his appearance made little difference to the story and perhaps the story would have been the same (or maybe better) without himThe other weak link of the film is certainly Steppenwolf, the villain. With very little character or personality, Steppenwolf here just appears as a random, generic bad guy threatening to conquer the world. His 'evil plan' is dull and simple, easily thwarted and is of very interest. Considering the roster of characters DC have at their disposal it seems strange and disappointing to have chosen this to be the Justice League's first threat.Despite their recent wobbly track-record, fortunately the first live-action film of Justice League is not the disappointment so many dreaded. Leaps and bounds ahead of the first three films but certainly not as excellent as Wonder Woman, Justice League suffers from a lacklustre plot, iffy structure and painfully generic, boring villain (not to mention the Amazon costume controversy). However, luckily we have great actors playing lovable characters, wonderfully exciting and kinetic action set-pieces and a more light-hearted tone with comedic moments that gives the whole film a unique personality. Though not all critics may like this film, this is certainly a crowd-pleaser and, at last, it feels like DC are on the right track.",7,1,3,20 November 2017
Dunkirk," A hauntingly beautiful film that succeeds on every level. A classic in the making and one of the best war films made
","Christopher Nolan is a big name in cinema today. A master known for bringing a sincerity to excitement; a man known for amazing and successful films; and a director known for long runtimes. Dunkirk is not a long film however. In fact it's Nolan's shortest film for some time with a runtime of just 106 minutes. However, this isn't something to be worried about; there's still plenty crammed into these 106 minutes with little to no padding. Every minute is absolutely worth it and they all add up to a modern masterpiece of war films.Set in 1940, allied soldiers from France and the UK are being pushed back to the beach of Dunkirk, where they wait patiently by the sea, hoping desperately to be rescued before the Germans catch up to them. Set around this we follow three distinct stories that converge together as the film goes on. We open with Tommy (Fionn Whitehead), a British soldier, stuck at the beach for a week, desperate to survive no matter the cost. Secondly we have Mr Dawson (Mark Rylance), daring British yachter, who sets off to Dunkirk in his yacht, accompanied by Peter (Tom Glynn-Carney) and George (Barry Keoghan), keen to save the soldiers stuck across the channel, lasting a day. Finally there are RAF pilots Collins (Jack Lowden) and Farrier (Tom Hardy), protecting the soldiers and ships from the skies against the unrelenting attacks of the German planes.In many ways, Dunkirk isn't so much a war film as it is a horror film – perhaps they are both equal parts horror and war films (though a more unconventional horror film maybe). While not nearly as gory as many contemporary war films, from Saving Private Ryan to Hacksaw Ridge, the violence here is no less horrific, proving that blood and guts aren't necessary for the horror of war to have an impact. The scenes of war aren't trivialised; there's no violence for violence's sake. In fact as an audience, we almost rather there were no violence; you find yourself biting your nails, screaming in your head for them to run away rather than turn and fight – quite the opposite to your normal summer blockbuster. A lot of this is achieved through the sound. From Hans Zimmer's haunting score (he's on top of his game on this one, though the lack of a noticeable theme tune is a shame) to the scream of the German planes and the thud of the bullets and bombs as they find their unfortunate targets. These sounds are done so well; so loud and vivid, they're terrifying to hear and really strengthens the scenes of war you see on screen.This does however result in the portrayal of Germans as being a faceless enemy, devoid of any humanity. Although this is realistic in how the soldiers would have viewed the Germans, bolstering the immersion, it means that this film lacks that touch of humanity seen in an enemy which is often a really powerful element in war films (particularly in films such as All Quiet on the Western Front). In fact human touch in general is arguably the only main flaw of the film, with characterisation very muted and subtle. In there being no padding and immersing us in the horrors of Dunkirk, there's very little time for us to get to know the characters and let them grow. This isn't to say the characters are boring and we don't care about them (quite the opposite), but there's no memorable character to emerge from this – with the possible exception of Rylance's Mr Dawson. Despite this the actors do very well with the very few lines they're given. Tom Hardy and Jack Lowden have great chemistry even from different planes as brave fighter pilots. Cillian Murphy in particular stands out as the shellshock soldier you could almost hate at some point, if it weren't for Murphy's terrifically complex performance squeezing sympathy from you. A strong opening film for newcomer Fionn Whitehead with an equally good performance from Harry Styles. Rest assured he's not the disaster many feared. Leagues above singers-turned-actors like Beyonce and Rihanna, he can sit up at the top with the likes of David Bowie and Ed Sheeran (yes, I actually liked his cameo in Game of Thrones). British acting royalty Kenneth Branagh as Commander Bolton and Mark Rylance predictably are the acting highlights, bringing the patriotism in spades and much needed strong screen presences.However the reason lots of lines and exposition isn't necessary is simply because Christopher Nolan is an expert filmmaker, realising that the true power of cinema is to show, not tell. This is a visual medium and is always at its strongest when it can show the story better than it can tell it. Again working with his same director of photography from Interstellar, Nolan lets Hoyte Van Hoytema to perfectly capture the horrors of Dunkirk. A single, well-crafted, beautiful but terrifying shot can say more than 106 minutes of pure dialogue ever could; and nearly every shot has that kind of power. This is a quasi-masterclass in cinematography, showing the true power and versatility of film's ability to portray story and emotion simultaneously.A hauntingly beautiful film that succeeds on nearly every level. What it lacks in lines and characterisation, it makes up for in nuanced performances and plenty of emotion, the horror and realistic portrayal of war coming from the expertly crafted shots and excellently edited sound. Miles away from your typical summer blockbuster, Nolan's Dunkirk is a roller-coaster of fear, noise, war and emotion – already bound to be a classic.",9,0,8,14 August 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Absolute Perfection - Exceeds All Expectations and Blows You Away. Best Marvel Film Yet.

Just wow. For a film that generates so much hype in the months running up to its release, it's incredible when it not only meets expectations, but exceeds them to the point where even more hype is garnered. There are so many words to describe Marvel's latest - emotional, epic, fun, stressful, scary, hilarious, incredible. In about 2 and a half hours you will laugh, you will cry and you will cheer. It's a phenomenal achievement, the biggest marvel of Marvel yet, and a huge round of applause is warranted to everyone involved in the film. You don't need to be a fan to love this film.It's a very simple story without lots of twists and turns, making it very easy to follow - that is, provided you've seen all (or at least most) of the films so far. For those who have been at least casually following this monumental cinematic series, everything will make sense and the characters are already known. By letting the previous films set everything up, that allows Infinity War to pack so much more in the film and just get on with it from the word 'go'. The ever-important Infinity Stones themselves are much more than simple McGuffins - the film makes the audience care about them, Thanos visibly becoming stronger with every one he collects. It's not just as simple as Thanos collecting six stones, however. Instead this doesn't follow the usual superhero story or structure, instead being utterly unpredictable, allowing the audience no respite or way to prepare for the madness that occurs. This is a very different type of superhero film, Marvel able to break away from the mould. This is a strength of the film and they absolutely do not shy away from it. This is best seen in the ending which will go down in history, along with the likes of The Italian Job. It's a bold, brave finale - in a way I would have preferred a slightly more rounded end, but the film is too daring for that, instead setting things up for Avengers 4 perfectly (even in the post-credits scene).Considering there are over 30 characters the audience will recognise, the directors and writers have done an excellent job of balancing the characters, all seen through the structure of the film itself. Structured more like an episode of Game of Thrones, we follow different groups of characters as the climax slowly comes to a head. One moment we'll be with Iron Man, Dr Strange and Spider-Man, the next we're journeying across the galaxy with Thor and the Guardians, and next we find ourselves with Cap, Falcon and Black Widow. No character seems particularly side-lined or unimportant and the structure allows for each and every character to make a solid contribution and get their fair share of screen-time.Whereas Age of Ultron had more of an emphasis on story rather than characters, Infinity War is the complete opposite, the characters coming together instead being the main point of the film itself. It's a relief then that, besides all characters having a fair amount of time, they are all fantastic and an absolute joy to see all together in one film, every group seeping excellent chemistry. It never feels forced or gimmicky, but instead authentic and natural to see them all team up and work together. It also emphasises how perfectly cast all the characters have been over the years, able to hold their own and interact with everyone else so brilliantly. With so many characters, a film like this shouldn't work, but incredibly it does and is all the better for it. None of the groups are ever the default boring one (unlike Frodo and Sam in Lord of the Rings), but they are all lovable characters with exciting plot lines. On top of that they're all hilarious. As ever, Drax might be the funniest; but there are jokes from Stark, Strange, Quill, Groot, Rogers, Okoye... the list is endless. In a film with so much heart and action, it's amazing they managed to fit in so much comedy. It's beginning to sound like a clichÃ©, but this is absolutely the funniest Marvel film yet - certainly funnier than the majority of 'comedies' that come out these days. Even the new character Eitri played by Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage gets his share of laughs. The biggest surprise with regards to characters however is Thanos. While his cohort may be formidable yet fairly bland (with the exception of the brutally sinister and downright scary Ebony Maw, played by Tom Vaughan-Lawlor), Infinity War's central villain Thanos is an exceptional antagonist, brilliantly played by Josh Brolin. As terrifying and intimidating as the monstrous purple alien may be, there is a quiet, emotional side to him. Unlike many villains, he's not looking for power for the sake of power. There's an element of humanity to him and he genuinely believes that what he's doing is for the good of the universe. This is not an antagonist to add to the ever-growing annals of forgettable villains - Thanos is the formidable foe we needed and wanted. No longer will Loki be the best Marvel bad guy by default. Will he go down as the best superhero villain since the Joker?Of course it's not all laughs and chasing stones. As expected in a film like this there's action - lots of action. It's appropriate that the word 'war' appears in the title since this is by far the most action-packed Marvel film we've seen. Despite the nigh-on non-stop action, it never gets boring or seems like too much. With a rich plethora of characters comes a wide variety of action and fighting styles. No two characters fight in the same way and so the action always seems fresh. It's a pleasure seeing all these characters we have grown to love come together and fight with one another. The CGI and fight choreographing is incredible and the battle scenes are beautifully filmed. Definitely worthwhile being seen in IMAX!The biggest downside is having to wait a year to find out what happens next, with no clues in the upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp or Captain Marvel in the interim (since they're set before the events of this film). Still, if the next Avengers film is anything like Infinity War we're in for another incredible treat. With terrific character interaction, hilarious comedy, sublime action and a shocking ending that will keep you awake at night - it's all perfect. The 10 years Marvel has spent leading up to this has been absolutely worth it. A splendid and monumental achievement. All hail Marvel - but beware, Thanos will return...",10,25,50,28 April 2018
A Quiet Place," A Loud Cheer for A Quiet Place - Gloriously Tense and Intense!
","TL;DR<ul><li>A unique horror film; mature and well-filmed without copious amounts of gore and cheap jump scares</li></ul><ul><li>Engaging horror concept</li></ul><ul><li>Simple story with family at its core</li></ul><ul><li>Exceptional use of sound</li></ul><ul><li>Not scary, but very tense and suspenseful</li></ul><ul><li>Well-acted considering lack of lines</li></ul>-------------------------------The horror genre is a tricky one to get right. All too often horror films are sub-par, a sick parody of its own genre, pandering to the lowest common denominator with copious and unnecessary amounts of gore and cheap, poorly filmed jump-scares - not to mention the countless sequels (how many Saw and Friday 13th films are there now?). Sad as that may be, there is a silver lining; namely, in a genre saturated with bad films, whenever there is a genuinely decent, different one, it gets the appropriate attention and praise it deserves. Recently we got Get Out - a different, unique horror film that audiences and critics alike adored, partly due to its strength and partly because it stood out in an otherwise iffy genre. Now we have A Quiet Place - while it may be wildly different to Get Out (in terms of plot and scares to name just a few), it is comparable in how it seems to have made a splash, bringing in a large audience and receiving universal praise and adoration. Indeed, I think it's fair to say that we haven't seen suspense like this in a film since the Master of Suspense himself, Alfred Hitchcock.The story itself is very simple with its core concept being the main driving force. While it may not be the most original concept (monsters in videogames love being blind but sensitive to sound; from Until Dawn to the clickers in The Last of Us), it's done exceptionally well and completely sells the concept to the audience with its commitment being absolute. The first part of the film is noteworthy for its detail, showing us the fascinating intricate workings of a life spent in total silence, each and every character consistently tense and aware, waiting for things to go wrong. And, as is inevitable in a horror film, when things do eventually go wrong, it's incredible how tense and exciting the climactic final act is. It may not be scary, but it's hard to think of many films that have mastered suspense and tension like this.The use of sound is exceptional and really well done. It's almost a shame it didn't come out sooner; at least an Oscar nomination would have been likely. This is proof that cinema is not just a visual medium and that what we hear can be just as potent as what we see. If anything, hearing but not seeing is sometimes more powerful, raising tension and letting our imagination do the work. From foley to music, the sound (or occasionally the lack of) is the main 'character' and reason for seeing the film, making it so unique. The music from Marco Beltrami in particular is worthy of note, always quiet and understated, used to punctuate the film well, make it more dramatic, but never detracting from the power of silence. Still, with sound and silence being so important, it's tricky to know how to recommend watching this film; you really do need the immersion that a cinema provides, but there's no feasible way to control coughs, sniffs and the noisiest culprit of all, popcorn. Maybe it's best to win the lottery and have you own private home cinema.The cast does a decent job considering the remarkable lack of lines, relying instead on complete physical acting. This is particularly impressive for relative newcomer Millicent Simmonds and another excellent title to put on Noah Jupe's filmography. The chemistry between real-life couple Emily Blunt and John Krasinski comes through and helps strengthen their on-screen relationship with a strong, believable romance. The only issue is, without many lines, it's difficult to craft unique, special characters and to know them intimately. But the tension between Regan and Lee is the aspect that stands out best, really selling the central theme of family.A Quiet Place is a special, unique horror that shows what can be achieved by this genre when it's not pandering to the lowest common denominator. With an engaging concept and impressive physical acting by the cast, it's a small, intimate film with huge tension. Hitchcock may have been the master of suspense, but sound hasn't been used this strongly before. Is this the year's best horror already?",8,2,4,13 April 2018
Coco," Another Masterpiece from Pixar - bring tissues and get ready for a new favourite
","TL;DR
<ul><li>One of Pixar's absolute best</li><li>Original, relatable and adorable story</li><li>Beautifully animated with stunning visuals</li><li>Genuine Mexican representation and a love-letter to its country</li><li>Catchy tunes that will tug at your heartstrings</li></ul>------------------------------------------It seems strange, but I remember a simpler time when Pixar only had a few films under their belt; Toy Story (1 and 2), A Bug's Life, Monsters Inc. ... They quickly became famous for delivering outstanding films with excellent animation and a heart that appeal to adults as much as their intended audience, children. Now, releasing their 19th film, Coco, Pixar have built up such a strong reputation that their films can't fail to bring with them not only hype and excitement, but astronomically high expectations. Occasionally they trip up (the Cars series comes to mind...) but they've never made an outright bad film yet. So is Coco the one to stop their perfect run? Absolutely not - if anything, Coco shoots right up to the top Pixar films of all time, happily nestled among the best films (animated and otherwise) of all time.As they've proved time and time again, Pixar can give one hell of an amazing, original story. Whether it's toys trying to return home, a fish finding his son or ants fighting for freedom, Pixar always manage to find a story that everyone can relate to in some way; a story where someone is searching for something important to them. Coco, yet again, gives us a relatable and universal story about music, family and self-discovery. More than this though, they deliver an original, creative story that's as entertaining as it is moving. Sweet and touching as we've come to expect, this film particularly focuses on the importance of family, acceptance and love embedded in an exciting story which never gets stale.Of course it's impossible for it to get stale and for us to feel bored because the film's just too beautiful. Though now at the point where we rarely even acknowledge it, there are instances where we can see how advanced CGI has become. Coco is a perfect example of what can be done today, with stunning visuals and incredible attention to detail. It is one of the most gorgeously animated Pixar films, with as much detail and thought going into the 'real world' as there is in the eternally colourful Land of the Dead. The film absolutely sucks you in with a vivid world saturated with exquisite colour and designs.Indeed, these would be nothing without the culture of its subject in the first place - Mexico, itself an extraordinarily colourful place. Pixar seem to have in a way dedicated this film as a love-letter to Mexico, its people and its culture. This is far from cultural appropriation some may have feared; instead everything here is utterly Mexican, somehow managing to disguise occasionally exposition-heavy dialogue and make learning fun. Even the language, though predominantly English, still includes many Spanish words, from the basics like 'gracias' to more specific words like 'ofrenda.' There aren't any token references to culture; instead Pixar have absolute commitment to the culture, something which is absolutely commendable. This extends even to the cast, all being ethnically appropriate with only the small exception of John Ratzenberger, Pixar's 'good-luck charm' who's in nearly every Pixar film somewhere.One aspect not often celebrated in Pixar films is music. While Disney films are often animated musicals, Pixar films are usually just animated films, music confined just to the soundtrack. Instead, Coco places music front and centre along with family as its focus. Beside the gorgeously composed score from Michael Giacchino is music from the very talented Robert Lopez (one of the geniuses behind The Book of Mormon, a show packed with wonderful songs) and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, the couple who notably created those catchy and unforgettable songs from Frozen. Whilst there may be no 'Let It Go' in Coco (a relief to parents worldwide), 'Un Poco Loco' and, more than this, 'Remember Me,' are wonderful songs that will stay in your head and be sung as favourites for years to come. 'Remember Me' especially is the one song guilty to make you weep in your seat towards the end (make sure you watch this in 3-D - you need the glasses to hide those tears!)It might seem like a daring move to make a 'children's' film about death - but, yet again, Pixar prove they can make a film about anything and still find a way to make it outstanding. With an original, sweet story, gorgeous visuals, wonderful music and genuine Mexican representation (a real middle finger up to Trump), Coco is a beautiful, magical film that can't fail to delight audiences worldwide - an absolute masterpiece. Bring some tissues, but get ready for one of your new favourite films.",10,0,1,17 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Forget the haters - The Last Jedi is big, bold & exciting with brilliant characters, shocking story developments and beautiful action scenes. Star Wars at its finest
","TL;DR
<ul><li>Comparable to TESB, but still different</li><li>All parts of plot substantial and interesting</li><li>Flicking between storylines emphasises the film's long runtime</li><li>Exciting questions posed in the last film given underwhelming answers</li><li>Several surprises you won't expect </li><li>Plenty of references to older films</li><li>Lots of comedy - perhaps too much?</li><li>New planets are imaginative - particularly the final planet</li><li>Incredible fight and battle scenes - Star Wars action at its best</li><li>Characters new and old are important to the story</li></ul>When it was announced that Disney would be buying Star Wars and adding more films, there was widespread fear and moaning on the internet. However, Disney found our lack of faith disturbing and our doubts were suitably crushed. But what now? Can lightning strike twice and can Rian Johnson pull off something as wonderful as J.J. Abrams? The answer is a resounding yes.TFA has often been compared to ANH, where there are a number of striking similarities. Therefore it's long been assumed that TLJ would continue along a similar vein, being alike to TESB. However, whilst there are certainly similar aspects, TLJ is a very different beast to TESB. Now we know the characters, the plot is split in 3 parts, much like TESB was split in two. But neither of these storylines feels like a 'side-quest.' Instead they all feel like substantial parts of the film, keeping the story fresh and engaging, coming together perfectly.One minor issue with flicking back and forth is it emphasises the films long length of 2 ½ hours. Whilst the pace never feels slow or boring, its skipping from one story to the next does make you realise the long run-time. But when it's so enjoyable it's hard to care. On top of this, not much has really changed. Whereas sequels should take the overarching plot further than the first, not much is different and it feels as though some significant plot point is lacking. Additionally there were some potentially big, exciting questions posed in the preceding film which are wasted, some great potential just being thrown away, almost as if this film doesn't want to be included in the overarching narrative.Also every blockbuster now insists on including so many comic moments it becomes a quasi-comedy. On one hand, the comedy in TLJ is very funny and it adds a fun characteristic to the movie's personality. On the other hand, it verges on overstaying its welcome, occasionally going a gag too far.Still, we do get to explore more planets. The world of Star Wars is a big one with unlimited potential and part of the original joy was seeing things we'd never seen before. With CGI as incredible as it is these days this challenge is becoming harder, yet the creativity of Star Wars' galaxy still taps into our imagination. It's safe to say that Las Vegas will soon see a Star Wars-y element to it. Luke's planet is also a lot more fleshed out and not as barren or boring as it could have been. After all, who doesn't want to run away to an island populated by those adorable Porgs?! The final planet we find ourselves on is stunning. A thin layer of what looks like snow hiding a mass of deep red salt that, when disturbed, goes flying into the air, a gorgeous rich burgundy cloud of dust floating around, contrasting with the pure white ground - an incredible backdrop for a thrilling climactic battle. This is the sort of look we really need and want from the Star Wars sequel trilogy. The CGI in the prequel trilogy made that galaxy look very different to the original. What the sequel trilogy excels at is faithfully continuing the look and feel of the original trilogy whilst subtly updating it to feel more authentic. It's a joy to see that along with the references to the originals to revel in the nostalgia; yet the message it also gives is a good one - especially for a beloved franchise transforming to suit the modern day (for better or worse); namely it's fine to look back fondly and smile, but it's important to be able to move on and look to the future...The newer films certainly improve on action scenes. Take any space battle or light sabre fight you want from this film; they're all thrilling, edge-of-your-seat stuff, giving you a big enough adrenaline rush to boost you into hyperspace. TLJ shows us Star Wars action at its finest; quick, fun, kinetic, explosive, acrobatic. It's all wonderfully varied, excellently choreographed, seamlessly performed and beautifully scored, with the returning John Williams remaining the biggest behind-the-scenes hero of the Star Wars films.The biggest bridge between trilogies is the characters. We have a pleasant mix of classic and new characters. The original characters are still highlights, with many an audience incapable of giving a cheer when they see Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, R2-D2... and yes, even C-3PO. They don't appear just as cameos though; these characters bridge the gap between films and are crowd pleasers (along with all the nostalgic references and appearances), but more than that they are genuinely included within the story as substantial roles. This isn't just a brand new trilogy, but the use of these characters show it's an expansion of the Star Wars saga, emphasising how this is one continuous story. However we see a different Luke Skywalker here than before. Still time has passed since ROTJ and it's important for characters to progress... Their inclusion of Carrie Fisher's General Leia was done very well (apart from one particular strange scene in space) and often felt like a fitting tribute.The new characters can stand proudly among the classics. Rey and Finn come back, each leading their own storylines confidently, both developing their characters; Ridley going from naïve to more confident, and Boyega as always being a consistent to joy to watch. Hux get more time on-screen to shine and uses that time well, establishing his character much more. Kylo Ren goes deeper and brings out the conflicted nature of his character effortlessly, showing us the real danger is how we can never trust him. Serkis could have been a memorable antagonist, but isn't given the chance. Newcomers Del Toro, Dern and Tran all put their own unique touch on the franchise, Tran's Rose in particular lending a personal, more human touch that gives us pause to think and reflect on our own world. The best character change is Isaac's Poe. A stand-out character from TFA, he's given more screen-time, his electric energy permeating his scenes. Then there's BB8, who, while not used as frequently, still steals the scenes he's in.Star Wars: The Last Jedi has proved to be a divisive entry in the franchise. This came as a surprise to me as I came out of the cinema with a huge smile on my face. While it may suffer from a long run-time, thrown-away plot-points and maybe a bit too much comedy, TLJ is excellent and enjoyable. Big, bold and exciting with brilliant characters, shocking story developments and beautiful action scenes, this is the Star Wars film we needed.",8,1,3,22 December 2017
The Shape of Water," Instant Classic and Sublime 'Adult Fairytale'
","TL;DR:<ul><li>Phenomenal style - sound and visuals bring this vivid world to life</li><li>Beautifully shot</li><li>Thematically rich</li><li>Wonderful performances, particularly by Sally Hawkins</li><li>An instant classic, one that will improve with every watch</li></ul>------------------------------------------------Guillermo del Toro isn't a new director by any means; an expert and renounced filmmaker, he already has a few masterpieces under his belt (such as Pan's Labyrinth) along with a few blockbusters (like Hellboy or Pacific Rim). Now he's back with his first film since Crimson Peak in 2015...and it's wonderful, as good as Pan's Labyrinth, if not better. A modern reselling of a classic Beauty and the Beast-esque tale, Shape of Water is an instant classic, a fairytale film with a dreamlike quality about love, humanity and so much more.The first thing to notice in this film is the style, one that Del Toro absolutely commits to and makes exceptional. It's a beautifully romanticised view of the 1960s, with a wonderful soundtrack and exquisite set design. Imagine Bioshock with a love story. From sound to visuals, the style is unique and breathtaking, absolutely sucking you into a dreamlike world absolutely fit for a 'fairytale' such as this. Even monotonous parts of Sally's life are shot beautifully and Del Toro proves to us once again what he's capable of directing.However it's still Del Toro and anyone who's seen one of his films, from Pan's Labyrinth to Crimson Peak, knows that he has a penchant for the weird and wacky. Weird and wacky in this case though has never been so beautiful and emotional. Straddling themes of love, politics and what is is to be human, this is a film that will no doubt be studied and loved for years to come, with it improving with each viewing.Taking just the story and way it's filmed alone it's a wonderful film already; but it's the cast that make it that much more magical. Michael Shannon often plays the bad guy, but there's a reason for this typecast - he's perfect as it. He doesn't necessarily need to shout; with just a look and a mumble, he crafts an intimidating, unpredictable character that poses as an ominous threat throughout. Octavia Spencer is another one typecast, often playing a sassy lady who's prejudiced against (in this case by Shannon's character, believing himself to be God and everyone else, Spencer's character specifically, to be below him), yet she effortlessly excels in this role and is the perfect friend to Elisa. On the other side is Elisa's other friend, Giles. His friendly, but timid character grounds a film with so much craziness and lends some much needed comic relief; sweet and lovely as the film maybe, it's not a light, easy-going comedy. Zelda and Giles are the perfect friends for Elisa, one being black, the other gay, they understand her struggle as a mute and not being able to fit in with a prejudiced world. This is a struggle personified further in the Amphibian Man, animated wonderfully with terrifyingly realistic gills and colourful scales. Straddling the boundary between animal and man, Doug Jones physical performance really sells the character and the theme it represents. The real star of the cast, however, is Sally Hawkins. With next to no lines at all, her performance is stand out. We fall in love with her without her needing to say a word, similarly to the Amphibian Man. It's this similarity which really brings them together, but it's her performance which stands out the most. With every emotion and thought showing on her face, we feel strongly for this character, sympathising her with every step. Never quite given a chance to shine before, it's wonderful to see what Hawkins can do, able to command such screen presence without a voice and to show her character's struggle vividly.The Shape of Water is an incredible, beautiful and sweet film that will touch the hearts of moviegoers worldwide. A cautionary tale with a plethora of themes and messages that anyone can identify with, this will be a beloved classic, loved more and more with every re-watch. A magical, fairytale that deserves each of its 13 Oscar nominations. It may not win them all, but it certainly deserves the recognition and praise. A masterpiece and an instant classic.",8,32,60,23 February 2018
American Made," A few too many montages and some underdeveloped characters, but funny & fast-paced with non-stop laughs and thrills
","Biopics can be a tricky genre, their conventions prone to becoming stale and boring. Yet Liman and Cruise together brought us a refreshing and intriguing take on sci-fi/action films in Edge of Tomorrow – can they do the same for biopics? In short, yes and no. Though a simple but exciting story well-told and fun to watch, the biopic conventions and structures are the same we've seen before and become a little monotonous and repetitive.In terms of structure and story it's very reminiscent of lots of crime biopics, particularly Scorsese's Goodfellas and The Wolf of Wall Street; there are so many similarities – fans of these films are bound to enjoy elements of American Made, rife with innumerable montages and voice-overs. The problem is, once you take a step back and really look at it, there are just so many. A couple of scenes, then a montage with a voice-over, then another scene, followed by another montage accompanied by a montage; rinse repeat (and repeat). This is the structure the film follows for the majority of its run-time and it does start to wear a little thin, feeling repetitive.Still, the plot itself is fairly light and simple while also being fun and entertaining, charting the progression of Barry's journey from rags to riches (and inevitably rags again), yet within these montages they cram so much in, it feels like an epic journey with a huge story. So much enjoyable detail is packed into these montages while still keeping the story flowing at an excellent pace that we never really get tired of the constant montages. They're fun, often amusing, and bring so much for us to enjoy. The film just doesn't slow down for you to think, evoking its protagonist's adrenaline- seeking nature – this is where so much of the fun and personality in the story come from.More than this though, the montages are a perfect showcase of the style and personality the director injects into the film. The voice-overs are perfect accompaniments to the fun montages (full credit given to both Tom Cruise for his delivery and Gary Spinelli for his excellent screenplay), but it's the director's style that makes this film a fun affair, constantly laughing and poking fun at the danger Barry frequently finds himself in. It's light and comedic, with animated maps that are like a cross between Indiana Jones and Dad's Army. The music choices too aren't only authentic to the era, plunging us headfirst into the 1970s and 1980s, but really put us in the giddily excitable mood we should be in as we enjoy watching Barry get away with everything. It's a fun, cocky style that suits the main character and drives the film.While Cruise's performance is spot-on, his portrayal of Barry Seal is similar to many other characters he's played; lovable, but cocky guys who always have a smart way out, laughing in the face of danger all the while. In many ways really he carries this film, showing his real talent as an actor since we never get fed up of nearly 2 hours of nigh on constant Tom Cruise. Still this is largely due to the fact that the script rarely gives anyone else a chance. The character we see the next most of would be Domhnall Gleeson's CIA man Schafer, who is wonderfully ambiguous as we never know whether he's good or bad, whether Barry should trust him or not. He keeps this going for the whole film and plays well opposite Cruise; it's just a shame he doesn't get a chance for his character to develop to the extent it could have done. The Medellín cartel too are excellent, a careful balance of welcoming charm with a sinister undercurrent of cruel menace and violence.Sadly many other characters are unfairly marginalised, not having the screen time they really deserve. While Caleb Landry Jones has a nice brief turn as Lucy's annoying, trouble-making brother (a very similar role to his one in Get Out just a few months earlier), it's all too brief. This extends to the four pilots Barry recruits to join his little gang. Each of these characters could have been unique and quirky, befitting of the film's style and really enriching the roster of characters. Instead they're left by the wayside, occasionally appearing for plot-points or small laughs. It felt as if they were only included for the sake of accuracy to real life, whereas they could have been developed into wonderful little characters. Sarah Wright's Lucy however is the biggest missed opportunity. Continuing the comparison to The Wolf of Wall Street, Scorsese really did something excellent with Margot Robbie's character, Naomi, that part alone making the huge star she is today. If only the script had allowed for more to be made of Lucy in American Made. Beautiful, effortlessly sexy and loyal even when the going gets rough, Wright's portrayal is excellent and it's a joy to watch her. However, it feels like with a bit more she could have been more than just eye candy and the 'wife-left-back-home', the family scenes seeming less important that the money-grabbing main plot. Her inclusion improves as the film goes on, yet it still feels as though more could have been done with her. Funny, fast-paced and with tons of enjoyable detail in more montages than you can count, this is a fun, stylish biopic which you can't help but enjoy. Though the structure (particularly the montages) can become repetitive, not much is done to make it stand out or refresh the biopic genre and despite the film focusing too much on Cruise when there were some potentially excellent characters left on the side, this is a crime-comedy-biopic that never slows down, giving you all the thrills and excitement Cruise's character is in constant search of.",7,1,3,30 August 2017
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," An Ideal Sunday Afternoon Film. Ultimately Unremarkable, But Perfectly Pleasant
","TL;DR<ul><li>Absolutely English and proud to be so</li></ul><ul><li>Easy-going but enjoyable enough story</li></ul><ul><li>A little too long and the mystery can sometimes be a little underwhelming</li></ul><ul><li>Predictable plot</li></ul><ul><li>Heart-warming characters and solid performances</li></ul><ul><li>Ultimately unremarkable, but perfectly pleasant</li></ul>--------------------------There's a strange genre that seems to have been around for a few decades now. Some may call them comedy, drama, romance... though usually they incorporate genre tropes from all three. Yet the most common element that runs through them all is that they are 1.) sweet, 2.) able to be enjoyed universally and 3.) unequivocally English - with the crème-de-la-crème of British thespians and, quite often, set during WWII. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society (no, the title doesn't get easier to say the more you try) absolutely fits alongside those types of films being lovely in every sense (though sometimes a bit too lovely) with a pleasant story and great cast. Still, there's nothing special or unique about the film itself that allows it go above and beyond the existing classics.It's an easy-going, yet interesting story that effortlessly commands an audience. On the other hand, however, it takes a while for the story to get going, eventually exacerbating the other issue of the film being too long for what it is (ideally a film such as this would run in between 90 to 105 minutes). On top of this, the plot is fairly predictable; it's not too challenging to guess the ending before even the half-way mark. Still, it balances the stories of Juliet's relationships with the hunt for Elizabeth well, making the film part mystery - although it is admittedly a shame that most revelations concerning Elizabeth's eventual disappearance rarely seem like ground-breaking discoveries. Still, it's an enjoyable story, but this is mainly down to the characters who make it up.The real joy of the characters is not only watching them open up to Juliet and slowly tell her the story of Elizabeth's disappearance piece by piece, but by getting to know them and seeing their personalities unfold before us. This is strengthened by solid performances of heart-warming, well-written characters. Even the more secondary characters aren't glossed over and make genuine contributions to the film. From Goode's the paternal publisher to the smarmy Powell's American boyfriend, able to carefully tread the line between being simultaneously charming and repulsive. The group of society members themselves are the ones at the very heart of the film itself. These characters are the highlight of the movie, each of them unique and individual, able to portray the connection between the characters in what they do and say. Lily James once again proves to be a wonderful lead, charismatic and lovely to watch. It's difficult to predict a Mike Newell film when he's so diverse; from directing the likes of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire to Four Weddings and a Funeral, there isn't anything specific we can expect from him, other than he has the ability to craft entertaining and enjoyable films - though nothing quite as iconic since Four Weddings. The story and writing are enjoyable and the cast really sell it; while it may be ultimately unremarkable, it's nevertheless perfectly pleasant. An ideal film to watch with your feet up on a lazy Sunday afternoon with the whole family.",6,4,9,23 April 2018
Murder on the Orient Express," A solid whodunit thriller, but a mixed bag. Despite a few missed opportunities, Branagh leads a phenomenal all-star cast with some excellent performances
","It's strange to think that over the last 10 years or so we've had two popular incarnations of world-famous detective Sherlock Holmes, but no real big incarnation of Christie's wonderful Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot. Although the David Suchet series only ended in 2013, these episodes never reached the heights of popularity like we saw with Benedict Cumberbatch's or Robert Downey Jr.'s Sherlock. So it's about damn time something was done about it – so thank you Kenneth Branagh! Adapted from one of Christie's most famous novels, this version of Murder on the Orient Express brings with it a very impressive cast for Branagh's Poirot to interrogate his way through and find the murderer. We've seen Branagh take on Shakespeare and even Marvel so how does he fare with a bit of Christie? Well, fortunately the excellent and varied cast keep the film consistently engaging, captivating us as only these fine actors can do; but a lack of consistent style and slightly messy reveals overshadow what could have been quite an exceptional whodunit.As far as the actual story itself goes, it really is exceptional; it's difficult to fault Christie and her intricate plots and director Branagh and writer Michael Green really do put across the story well. Yet the way the story's told doesn't quite seem to do the book justice. We've seen from BBC's Sherlock that when filmed well investigations can be delightfully exciting and lavishly filmed in a really stylish manner, flashbacks and effects utilised in a way to make each revelation and finding of a clue thrilling. Here however, clues are often underwhelming and almost forgettable, their importance not necessarily highlighted leaving it a little cluttered and making us feel slightly lost at times. All this culminates in a slightly underwhelming finale where we're still trying to play catch up with Poirot and navigate the maze of clues and motivations.Still, despite this, detecting and investigating the murder with Poirot can still at times be fun, feeling like we're part of the action. This is best done right at the beginning during a sort of mini-case, similar to small action scenes at the beginning of James Bond films; this scene in particular is done very well. A lot of this is down to the quips and jokes that come from Poirot, really making his character and adding a personality to the film. Sadly this doesn't last for the entirety, actually starting to stop around the time of the murder. This is a shame since the film loses an element of its personality when the laughs stop. Still, when they're there, they really do help for us to fall in love with Poirot.Most of that though is down to Kenneth Branagh, whose performance is excellent. If you think David Suchet is the only one who could play Poirot, this film will convince you otherwise. With an understandable and mercilessly non-annoying French/ Belgian accent, Branagh's incarnation is absolutely likable and played to perfection; you can't have too much of him and that wondrous moustache. The only issue though is perhaps there's too much Poirot; if you weren't already aware of the rest of the cast, you'd be forgiven for thinking they were all unknowns instead of A-list actors. This is definitely a Branagh film, with everyone else in supporting roles but then again, when he's as great as he is, it's really hard to care.This doesn't mean to say that the rest of the cast are just throwaway celebrity cameos. On the contrary, where the middle section is less detecting and more a series of interrogations, it could easily edge on being dull and monotonous. However this is saved by sharp dialogue and, more than this, the excellent cast. It's a shame they don't interact together more; we usually see them with Poirot as opposed to each other. Still the cast is eclectic and all-starred – quite simply an absolute joy to behold. They make every scene polished and fun to watch, each delivering stand-out performances with unique characters with different sides, never letting us know who we should trust.Then again, that's what you expect from a whodunit – a tense atmosphere where you can't trust anyone. Sadly there's rarely a particularly tense scene, something that feels particularly lacking. Considering they're trapped in a train because of an avalanche, snow surrounding and isolating them, the barren outside a deathly cold mountain, you'd have thought this would be an excellent way of heightening the claustrophobia and sinister atmosphere. Instead, although the scenery is beautifully filmed, it looks more like a Christmas card than a deadly setting for a murder investigation.On the whole a solid whodunit thriller, but a bit of a mixed bag. While the style, atmosphere and slow unveiling of the mystery isn't as strong or fun as it could be, Kenneth Branagh and his inimitable Poirot moustache leads a phenomenal all-star cast with some excellent performances. With a sequel set up in the end scene, I think you can rest assured that before too long Poirot will be on the case again.",6,8,20,5 November 2017
Black Panther," Exciting, fresh and everything I hoped it would be - one of Marvel's best yet.
","TL;DR
<ul><li>Stunning aesthetics</li><li>Commitment to African culture and Afrofuturism is wonderful with terrific results</li><li>A very colourful film</li><li>A refreshingly different feel for a superhero film</li><li>Exciting, fast-paced and varied action</li><li>As much comedy as you'd hope from a Marvel movie</li><li>Great performances with a strong supporting cast and one of Marvel's most compelling villains</li></ul>Black Panther is a special film in a number of ways. Not only is it the 18th Marvel film and the last one before the big third outing for the Avengers, but it's big for black culture and Afrofuturism, being the first big blockbuster superhero film featuring a black lead and, more importantly, a nearly all black cast (and crew). It's a step in the right direction for an increasingly out-dated and politically incorrect Hollywood, with arrogant 'white males' quivering in their seats. More than this, Black Panther is an incredible movie, more than a worthy addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The aesthetics are inspiring, every inch of Wakanda utterly African, each scene evoking a strong and exemplary sense of Afrofuturism. Black Panther is absolutely committed to the African cultures it portrays and the effect is not only different, but visually stunning and incredibly colourful. More importantly, it never feels forced, gimmicky or frequently mentioned, constantly reminding people how PC they are. Instead the blend of African cultures embodied in Wakanda feels natural and organic and its detail is wonderful at every level.In fact the aesthetics throughout the whole film are gorgeous. CGI, as expected in a film of this calibre, is second-to-none, but the cinematography alongside really captures the beauty of Wakanda, the wonders of a fictional technologically-advanced African country brought to life. Wakanda, stunning as it is, also feels fresh; Black Panther isn't just another superhero film with the titular character fighting their way across New York City. This freshness stretches throughout the whole movie, making it seem like a new kind of superhero film and putting to rest any doubts that Marvel's films could become stale or repetitive.It is a Marvel film though so there are some aspects that we come to expect; some that are welcome and some that are happily missing in this movie. One is the comedy, which is abundant throughout Black Panther. With plenty of laughs from beginning to end - coming from M'Baku (Winston Duke) and Shuri in particular - it helps in allowing Black Panther to fit effortlessly into the broader personality of the MCU. Origin stories are also expected in superhero films, but here that is forgone, something that adds to its strength. It never gets bogged down in origins or unnecessary details explaining comic book lore; instead, like with Spider-Man: Homecoming, it just gets going and tells us what we need to know as it goes, letting exposition fit neatly into the film and never letting it slow down the pace. Superhero action too is worthy of praise as it is some of the best we've seen yet. With multiple films of this genre coming out every year, it's understandably becoming difficult to impress an audience. However Black Panther has a slightly more fresh approach to its action; not too deep-rooted in unrealistic sci-fi/fantasy, the action is fast-paced, fun to watch and brilliantly choreographed with varied action. This latter point is largely down to Black Panther being almost an ensemble film. While the focus of the story and a lot of the action is on T'Challa, he's not the sole interest of the film. Instead we often see him fighting alongside Nakia, Okoye and even sometimes Shuri. Each with different personalities as well as fighting styles, this lends a varied approach to the fight scenes and make them so much more interesting to watch. Yet the highlight is still the titular Black Panther, with expert martial arts and gymnastics blending together to be an absolute joy.The joy doesn't stop with the action though. The quiet times are sometimes just as much fun, with the cast clearly having a blast. Chadwick Boseman builds on his debut in Captain America: Civil War, still retaining the characterisation from that film, but expanding it and making us love this character even more. Wise, strong and determined, he makes a fine King for Wadanda; but funny, sweet and loyal, he makes a fine superhero for the MCU. Boseman excels at bringing out all sides of T'Challa and we can't wait to see more of him in later this year with the rest of the MCU by his side. By his side this time though are a fine group of characters who could maybe even give the Avengers a run for their money. Okoye has a harsh-edge to her and watching her fight is incredible, yet Danai Gurira gives us a soft edge that she only reveals occasionally, making her enigmatic character more appealing. Letitia Wright and Lupita Nyong'o too bring so much personality to the film, often stealing scenes from the titular hero himself. Michael B. Jordan makes a worthy antagonist, actually being one of Marvel's best villains yet. Since their history of villains hasn't been great to date, you could assume that that isn't too high an accolade, but despite that he is a sympathetic villain with a likeable, funny side - the sort of villainy that made us all love Loki - supported by fellow bad guy, Andy Serkis returning as Klaue. Though not appearing much, he certainly makes his mark and lives up to the character's reputation. Martin Freeman's return as Ross is also very welcome and never a gimmicky, unnecessary reference to the wider MCU; instead he is allowed to develop a part that was too small in Civil War. This time he fits in organically and his American accent is as impressive as Andy Serkis' South African.It's safe to say that all the hype for Black Panther was worth it because it really is everything we wanted it to be. With exciting and varied non-stop action, plenty of comedy and an excellent ensemble of characters it fits into the rest of the Marvel cannon seamlessly. And while this one forgoes the sometimes unnecessary origin story, dives into a great plot and actually gives us an enjoyable villain, the best thing that stands out about Black Panther is how fresh it feels and looks and how committed it is to the inclusion of African culture and inclusivity. Yet again Marvel have delivered another outstanding film that instantly soars towards the top of the list.",8,39,85,18 February 2018
The Greatest Showman," Pleasant and Entertaining, but a Mess - Not the Greatest Show
","Around Oscar season there's always a musical there that promises to be the next big thing, often attracting Oscar nominations. With eye-catching trailers promoting catchy songs from the film along with a stellar cast that appeals to the whole family, naturally there are high hopes for such films; Les Miserables, La La Land to name a couple of recent ones - but you can take it back to the likes of Mamma Mia! or Sweeney Todd, not to mention classics like The Sound of Music, Oliver, Singin' in the Rain... Musicals can make a big impact on popular films and it's wonderful when they get it right. One look at the trailer for The Greatest Showman and it seems as though this film has similar aspirations - so does it hit the heights of other recent classics? Sadly, no; whilst this film may be sweet at times and entertaining enough to keep you going until the next musical in about a year's time, this is unlikely to become a classic family-favourite.On the surface, the story of Barnum's unrelenting climb to fame and success seems like quite an interesting one. Indeed, throughout the film there are numerous moments where the story is quite captivating. Sadly, these moments are too few in a film like this. Instead the story comes across as cluttered and unstructured. As is all too typical in a biopic, the challenge of including so many important events in one man's life becomes too much, resulting in so many things just happening; and not in the beautiful, well-choreographed way you see in John Lewis's advert about a girl growing up. Rather, the important events of Barnum's life are glossed over and just happen without giving us too much detail, almost as though we're given an edited version of the film. Getting married, having two adorable children, secondary characters falling in love, building a successful business from nothing, buying a big house... All these things just happen in between scenes and rarely give us much detail to feel as though we're with Barnum throughout his life. On the contrary, it's as though we're trailing behind, picking up the pieces and have to imagine how these things came to be. Of course the age old rags to riches element of the story is inspiring and entertaining as ever; combined with the the musical side of things, it's 'feel-good' factor is emphasised, but it's often lost amid a lack of structure and detail.Still, where dramas and musicals differ is the music, something very much present in this film, though on the whole it comes as very hit and miss. Partly my old-fashioned taste in music and love for classical musicals is to blame; but whilst I can appreciate some catchy tunes and good voices, it doesn't always seem to fit in with the tone and period of the film. This isn't to say that the music always has to fit in with the period of the film (often it doesn't but still works well - Hamilton for example), but the music numbers tend to stick out like a sore thumb instead of integrating itself seamlessly into the rest of the film. This is occasionally since there are instances of songs being noticeably shoehorned in and not occurring organically. Adding to this that the songs are obviously pre-recorded and don't look natural, means that this isn't the prize-winning element that it should be in a musical. On the other hand though, there are some dance sequences that are well-done and very enjoyable to watch. Sadly these don't scream glitz and glamour like Barnum deserves, and are occasionally underwhelming, but when the dance scenes work well, they're great fun to watch and compliment their songs well.So whilst the songs may be a bit underwhelming, fortunately the cast is not; the main cast is excellent and using brilliantly... Yet this seems to come at a the price of ignoring the rest. Hugh Jackman is stand out and his charisma and charm permeate each and every scene, letting him almost carry the film singlehandedly. He's effortlessly likeable and makes the otherwise occasionally irritating ambitions of P.T. Barnum much more palatable. Michelle Williams too is a wonderful addition to the main cast, lending a much needed human, heartwarming and loving touch that she displays marvellously. I've never yet seen a film where Williams isn't terrific and even this film is yet another example of how she deserves every Oscar for which she's been nominated (currently four times). Rebecca Ferguson also makes the most of her role as the counterpart to Williams' comforting wife, oozing sexy sensuality, but she certainly deserved more screen time. Disney stars Zac Efron and Zendaya come together in this non-Disney musical and do their thing well - Efron still hasn't lost any of that pazzazz that made him a hit in High School Musical and it's great to see him back in the genre, managing to be a great match opposite Jackman. Sadly though the romantic sub-plot between Efron and Zendaya isn't fleshed out or allowed to develop much. It just happens while Zendaya remains largely silent. Perhaps this is a way of emphasising the race issue her character suffers through, but within the confines of the circus cast, it would have been nice to allow her character to flourish and develop before us. There are other characters besides these, but sadly the filmmakers seem to have left the majority of the circus cast as a footnote. We have the impressive Keala Settle as the Bearded Lady and Sam Humphrey as dwarf Tom Thumb as spokespeople for an entire roster of interesting characters that make up Barnum's Circus. Aside from a short Full Monty style audition scene, we rarely get much of a look at them, let along many lines allowing us to get know these performers. Instead potentially the most interesting people in the film remain in the background for the majority, relegating them to being uncharacterised freaks - it's a real missed opportunity.Barnum may have been The Greatest Showman, but this isn't the greatest show by any means. Not to say it's all bad; on the contrary, it's pleasant and can easily entertain... but not much more. In a film riddled with missed opportunities, it tries so hard to dazzle and inspire us with awe that it forgets fundamentals in storytelling and characterisation. Much like Barnum's character, The Greatest Showman sets its sights too high to really pause and appreciate what's there already. Still, for an easy-going family-friendly musical, you could do worse.",4,1,2,1 January 2018
Pitch Perfect 3," Aca-trocious. Not funny, not entertaining and just embarrassing.
","TL;DR
<ul><li>Just awful</li><li>Ridiculous, boring story stuffed with silly side-stories in a failed attempt to engage the audience and not let them realise they've run out of ideas</li><li>Music from the other bands only emphasise the annoying noise coming from the main characters</li><li>The dance choreography is good, but sadly the editing doesn't allow us to enjoy it</li><li>Anna Kendrick is likeable as ever, but is playing the same character she always does</li><li>Hailee Steinfeld needs to go back to how she was in True Grit</li><li>Rebel Wilson is truly awful - crass, unfunny and annoying; an insult to comedy</li></ul>Pitch Perfect 3 wasn't my choice of film to go and see; and if there's ever a fourth, yet again I won't choose to see that one either. Sadly though, despite protests, attempts at compromise and pleas that I hadn't seen the others so it wouldn't make sense, I was dragged, kicking and screaming, into Screen 4 and told to be quiet and enjoy it. Enjoy it I did not, but at the very least I did stay quiet... Quieter than one should be in a comedy, without a single laugh emanating from my cringing face. I can only pray I won't be dragged to a mess like this again. Unfunny, embarrassing and incoherent, it baffles me that any film of this calibre can make it to a trilogy.The story is absolutely incoherent and not engaging in the slightest. It's akin to an X-Factor documentary more than a musical film. Giving up on their careers for a competition isn't the sort of message Hollywood should be giving to millennials struggling to get to grips with adulthood and heading to Europe is the most cliched move you can imagine - naturally every American franchise heads to Europe as soon as they run out of ideas. The competition itself means very little to the overall plot, with the writers having to shove in plot lines like Beca's romance and Amy's daddy issues to fatten up an otherwise depressingly thin and unengaging plot. Though it may be strange that the most boring story is the central one that the film revolves around, the really sad irony is that the side-stories are in fact the more interesting parts of the film. It's as though this film can't decide what genre it is or even what story it should be telling. This results in the film being even more infuriating.'Perhaps the music can save it,' I hoped. Sadly, unless you like subpar cover groups, this is unlikely to be the case. It's problematic when other groups are more talented and entertaining than the central one you're supposed to care about. If you were ever unsure about a cappella, this will not make you a fan. At times you'd be forgiven for assuming they were some sort of Alvin and the Chipmunks tribute band instead. At the very least the dancing is choreographed and performed well, allowing the dancing to be the best element to the movie - it's just disappointing the editing can't allow the camera to pause on one shot long enough to let us appreciate it.It's recently been said that modern American comedies are not what they used to be; this film is simple proof to back up that claim. The characters should be charming, funny and enjoyable to spend time with. As it happens, the cast of The Bellas are a strange bunch, but not in that charming, quirky way so many coming-of-age teen movies are. They're not particularly endearing, although at least they do work well together and come across as good friends - largely in the way they speak over each other, constantly cheer each other on, have group hugs... This can't fail to make you in the audience feel like an outsider, not welcome to join in and be part of The Bellas. Not that this is a bad thing; with a group of characters who are so similar, ditzy and brainless, I think I'd rather spend an hour and a half with one of the other groups. The main spokespeople for The Bellas is mainly confined to three main characters; namely Anna Kendrick's Beca, Hailee Steinfeld's Emily and Rebel Wilson's Fat Amy. I'm still confident that Anna Kendrick has the ability to broaden her range of characters - she's been playing the same sort of person for years. Still, despite her wasted potential in this film, she's fortunately likeable nevertheless and it's a relief that she's the central character as opposed to one of the others. Similarly, Hailee Steinfeld showed excellent promise years back when she got an Oscar nomination for her role in True Grit. How the mighty have fallen; it's noticeable that no other Oscar nominations have come her way since. If she were to distance herself from films like this and apply her likeable personality and brilliant talent, she'd be fighting the awards off with a golden stick. Sadly the third main character we see far too much of is Rebel Wilson. How she seems to be moderately successful I'll never understand. The polar opposite to Kendrick and Steinfeld, Wilson's not at all likeable, nor is she anywhere near as funny as her character was intended to be. With desperate, pathetic jokes and crass humour which shows an utter lack of wit, I can only hope that her lines were improvised and not written; such an embarrassment couldn't fail to end the careers of the writers (assuming there were any writers, I wouldn't be surprised if there weren't). The only saving grace in terms of comedy are Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins. Although not all their jokes hit the mark, their lines are the only sections of the film that bare any resemblance to comedy and they really do deserve more.Without seeing the previous two I can't comment on them, but I'm sure they can't possibly be worse than this. Perhaps one of the worst films I've seen in a while. It makes other disappointments in 2017 seem wonderful in comparison. Good dance choreography and occasional enjoyable music, can't save a film drowning in irritating noise from The Bellas, an incoherent central story consistently distracted by side-plots, ditzy and annoying characters talking nonsense over each other and unfunny, crass and embarrassing attempts at comedy that fall flat on their face, with most of them coming from one character in particular... Pitch Perfect 3 is so far from 'perfect', I can only hope that a fourth will never come to pass.",3,3,6,3 January 2018
Incredibles 2," 'Incredible' Film That Was Worth The Wait
","TL;DR<ul><li>Stands out amongst other superhero films</li><li>Weaker villain - as is plan and motivations</li><li>Fewer messages than the first</li><li>Elastigirl demonstrates stronger female agency - Disney/ Pixar is doing things right!</li><li>We see more of the characters</li><li>Good humour</li><li>Its style is still unique and enjoyable - blend of 60s Bond films and superhero genre works brilliantly</li><li>A sequel worth waiting for</li></ul>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Nowadays we expect superhero films at the cinema (can anyone remember a time when there wasn't at least one being shown?!). But in a time dominated by Marvel (or DC and Fox trying desperately to keep up) it's refreshing to have a superhero film that a.) isn't based off a comic book, b.) isn't from the usual Marvel, DC etc. and c.) is animated (although that's bound to change with the upcoming Teen Titans Go! To the Movies and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse). Not that Incredibles 2 is completely original - the '2' makes its sequel status clear, but it's been a long 14 year wait since the first... Back in 2004 the only superhero movies we really cared about were Raimi's Spider-Man films... So how does Incredibles 2 fare in an age already saturated with superhero films?There was something undeniably special about the first film's plot - it had moral messages both explicit and implicit that pleased countless audiences. Many went away with Syndrome's line ringing in their ears - 'When everyone is super, no one will be.' Ultimately the villain's plot and motivations in Incredibles 2 pale in comparison to Syndrome, as does the character itself. It all makes sense during the film, but after it feels forgettable and devoid of a powerful message. Additionally, I can't help but feel robbed of a large final encounter - but maybe we've become accustomed to Marvel's structure...On the other hand, it's impossible to walk out of Incredibles 2 without noticing some of the powerful messages conveyed; specifically it's brilliantly relevant and timely feminist message. Let's face it - Elastigirl is a better hero than Mr. Incredible; he's basically a non-green Hulk who hits things hard whereas there's no limit to what Elastigirl can do by contorting her body - she absolutely deserves the spotlight in this sequel. But more than that, Elastigirl's role in this film demonstrates another sense of female empowerment that Disney is doing so well at the moment. Not that Helen Parr is ready to stand up to the likes of Elsa and Moana, but it's definitely a step in the right direction and a good female role model for the young audience.The sequel also gives us an opportunity to enjoy more of the family dynamics within the Parr family. Although edging on the patronising side, seeing Bob cope with the reversal of the traditional roles adds in a nice bit of comedy, particularly his exhausted face as he deals with Jack-Jack's refusal to sleep and his rising frustration in the face of Math he was never taught. Incredibles 2 allows more of a focus on the family itself, giving the film a more unique feel to the original. As a result, we see a little more of each character; we see more of Violet and her effort to deal with her teenage angst; we see much more of Frozone; and we even see a more maternal side to Edna... It's even better to see more of Jack-Jack, a character who was noticeably side-lined for most of the original.However the best returning aspect is the style itself. As with the first film, Incredibles 2 marries the 60s era James Bond style with the superhero genre - a beautiful match made in heaven; Michael Giacchino's rollicking brass-dominated score is stronger than ever, strongly evocative of the old Bonds, and the set design is impeccable. I don't know if it was just me, but on top of everything else the music and aesthetic was one of my favourite parts of The Incredibles and I'm just happy it's as good in the sequel as it was back in 2004.Waiting for sequels (whether we know they're coming or not) is not unusual; after all there were over 30 years between the two Top Gun and Blade Runner films and more than 50 years in between the two Mary Poppins outings, not to mention the countless gaps between Star Wars and James Bond films... even Finding Dory came out 13 years after Finding Nemo. On the whole, I think it's safe to say that the sequels we wait for are worth waiting for (let's forget Godfather: Part III and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull for now...).It may be 14 years since the original but Incredibles 2 is just as enjoyable as the first. Though it may lack the bold heart and strong messages of the first, the characters are out in full force, kicking ass and making audiences laugh in style. This is the sequel we wanted - able to stand proudly amongst other superhero films that have come out in the meantime. As was integral to the film itself, Incredibles 2 is proof that we need more of Pixar's Supers!P.S. The Pixar short film before the film starts is just as adorable as ever (especially once you get to the end).",8,1,2,14 July 2018
