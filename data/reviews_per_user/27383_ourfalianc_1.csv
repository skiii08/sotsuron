United 93," Very Strong Movie
","Wait for video. Not worth a night out at the movies - I just saw this movie in the theater last night and it wasn't all that great. Although I knew how it was going to end, I couldn't help but hope that when they stormed into the cock pit that they were able to grab control of the plane and at least tilt it up but we all know that sadly that did not happen. To see a depiction of what it was like on board was gut wrenching - awful to see all those people say their final goodbyes, the tears, the anguish and some even had hope that they would be OK and get out of this alive. It was definitely hard movie to watch. Throughout this movie, you can't help but wonder how it would be possible for so much miscommunication and initial disregard of the first hijacked plane - how much time was wasted and how little it says about the control towers who had to turn on CNN to see what happened to flight 11. I think this movie provided some insight to Flight 93's fate but it could've been better.",6,1,3,8 May 2006
