Walk the Line," Terrific Musical Biography
","'I Walk the Line' is a great musical biography of Johnny Cash. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I've read criticism of it saying that it is the standard rock star film of battling drugs, etc, but Johnny Cash is anything but your normal star. He commands a respect to this day that very few (maybe Bob Dylan)do. The acting is outstanding on all counts, as Juaquin Phoenix does an amazing job portraying Johnny Cash. Even better is Reese Witherspoon as June Carter; what a terrific, inspiring performance. And of course, the advantage that a musical biography has over other biographical films is the great music, and there is a lot of it: 'I Walk the Line', 'Ring of Fire' and several other of Cash's legendary repertoire. The only reason it didn't get a 10 rating is because they downplayed the religious aspect of Johnny Cash's life, and the importance that his Christian faith had in what happened to him. I get tired of movie producers being almost embarrassed to delve into the subject of faith; his faith was a huge part of his life and it shouldn't be brushed aside like this. Otherwise, this film is terrific and I highly recommend it, especially to those who love great music. If you were not a Johnny Cash fan before watching this, chances are you will be afterward.",9,4,8,20 November 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Fancier than the Original Without the Heart
","Tim Burton's version of 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' certainly is fancier than the earlier version that starred Gene Wilder. The special effects are better, the music is hilarious, it seems a bit glitzier. There is only one problem; it lacks the heart of the original movie. It almost seemed to me that Tim Burton was more determined to make fun of the story instead of respecting it and it's message of goodness vs. selfishness, etc. To me, Gene Wilder is a much better Willy Wonka than Johnny Depp. Johnny Depp seemed too weird, almost like Michael Jackson. I could relate to the boy much more in the earlier version, and Jack Albertson was more believable than the boys relatives are in this film. The film does have its moments; the other kids are played terrifically, the special effects are terrific. The music routines were especially funny.To sum it up, this film's strength is also it's weakness; the humor, while providing moments of hilarity, also leaves one with a sense of shallowness, as though there is nothing in the story that is a serious message. I'll take the original film over this one, thank you.",5,0,2,13 August 2005
It's a Wonderful Life," My all time favorite film!
","For my money, there is no better film that this one. Excellent acting all around, including one of Jimmy Stewart's best performances. An uplifting film and I think the most heartwarming conclusion of any film in history. Hard to believe it didn't do well when it first came out in 1946. An excellent lesson in failure and redemption. A great movie not only for Christmas, but any day of the year. Donna Reed is excellent as Stewart's wife, and Lionel Barrymore is outstanding as the greedy banker. And of course, there is an angel, but if you haven't seen it (I can't imagine anyone who hasn't) I won't spoil it for you. I have watched this film countless times and never get tired of it, and I can't think of very many films I can say that about. Not only a must see, but a must own in your library!",10,1,5,25 June 2005
