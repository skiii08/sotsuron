Hereditary," it amazes me how this movie rates more than 3
",There are no words to describe the worst movie of the decade. There are low budget B or even C movies that are more pleasant to watch than this horrible mess of nothing. In mathematics it would be described as follows: 0+0 =0,1,0,3,27 January 2019
Mother!," This is a prank
",There is no other explanation. People who may have rated this with more than 2 stars are probably paid by the producers to do so.....This is by far the worst movie anyone can watch. I am 40 years old and I have been watching movies for the past 22 years (past 10 years 1 movie a day). There is no movie that I can remember that goes as LOW as this one. It is disgusting. It has no plot. The famous actors play absolutely no role to the movie. It could as well be any kind of citizen taken out of the street and it would still have the same result. Such a crap movie. Please make yourself a favour and do NOT waste 2 hours of your life.....you do it then you shall remember my words.....for those who already saw that I am sorry....,1,1,1,26 December 2017
