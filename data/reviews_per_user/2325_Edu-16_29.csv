The King's Speech," Words fail me
","Best film we've seen since English Patient.What a treat to be reminded once again that films are in fact about people and their relationships. The more believable these are the more we are drawn in to the magic and can share the emotion. In 'The Kings Speech' we have a film that draws you in utterly to the intense and crucifying pain of a stutterer, one who just happens to be heir to the throne of England and at a time when one particular live speech might influence the course of history.Despite the possibilities of pomp and circumstance, the style is austere, claustrophobic even. The last shot aside, its foggy out, rooms are sparsely furnished (even the palace!) and the camera is forever on the faces of the 'beyond words good' cast. This invites the closest scrutiny of the unfolding relationship of Logue and Bertie, and in every possible degree this is found 'pitch perfect'.From the opening scene, where Bertie walks up the steps to give his address at Wembley, you know you are watching something rather special. The miked stutter echo-ing over the silent and increasingly embarrassed crowd will long live in my memory I think. So will the scenes in Logue's consultation room, where the film had some outrageously funny moments, but at no cost to the building tension.I have no hesitation in recommending this to anyone, of any nationality, creed or age. That it is about the English royal family is purely incidental in my view. This is an acting tour-de-force and an inspiration to one and all.",10,1,2,23 January 2011
Howl's Moving Castle," Poetic, beautiful - a total delight
","Thanks in part to the equally wonderful 'Triplets of Bellevue' - the family have recently discovered that there is a whole world out there of imaginative and beatuiful animated film making. We've seen quite a number lately from Hayao Miyazaki and others - but to my mind this is our favourite so far.The story is of a plain girl who is turned into an old maid by a witch who is in turn in love with a wizard called Howl. The girl goes to work for Howl in his 'moving castle' as a cleaning lady and meets and befriends various characters during her adventures. Her relationship develops with Howl against a backdrop of a futile war and her struggle to find her youth once more.There is so much visual imagination in this film that you find yourself hitting 'pause' a lot to take the scenery in. It deserves the time. Some vistas are barely on screen for more than a second - but will take your breath away.The voice overs are well done - but I particularly liked Lauren Bacall as the witch of the waste. The music is equally stunning - with a main theme you never tire of. All in all - superb.PS. If you liked this - then you should also check out 'Whisper of the Heart', and 'Laputa'.",Null,1,2,20 May 2006
Mission: Impossible III," Mission should you accept it - to write something original for a change
","Ludicrous escapism - nothing new, nothing very clever. Loud and hackneyed.Cruise in cruise control - he's done this a million times before. The other actors are not asked to do much more than stand around admiringly and look loyal.Was there anyone in the cinema who thought for one moment Cruise was going to die at any stage? Of course not. So the dramatic tension generated by all this daring-do? Zilch.Oh for something with as much wit and style as the last movie that starred both Cruise and Hoffman - Magnolia.Go see Match point instead.",Null,2,4,20 May 2006
Minority Report," Over-rated
","My expectation level was high before this one - but all I can say is what on earth was all the fuss about?  It's okay - has some interesting scenes/ ideas.  But yet again it was let down by a poor script and some gigantic logic flaws that I just can't suspend my disbelief for.It's funny how Ill glibly accept that it is possible to see into the future, but - as a for instance - when Cruise returns to the police HQ and walses in through a back entrance one door away from the Precogs and use his 'old eyes' to fool the 'security' system - I nearly choked on my popcorn.   Since Cruise has already been marked as a pre-murderer at that stage, are we being asked to imagine that his 'access' records haven't been removed from the system?  Come on ?!!!  Are we idiots ?And as a final straw we realise at the end of the movie (and yes SPOILER ALERT) that the baddy (who is guessable from reel minus several thousand....) could have simply lured his victim to somewhere outside the Precogs 'range' rather than rig up an extremely complicated scene just to fool them.  Unfortunately the entire motivation of the plot is based around this act/ stupidity so it is very hard not to get extremely browned off with this film.As a final comment I thought that the movie lacked humanity.  THe treatment of the Precogs was hideous and immoral - but no one passed comment or even cared.  Even their attendant was clearly abusing them.  I found this very distasteful and completely unexplained.Of course going Nationwide with just 3 precogs was always going to be interesting.  How exactly would they cope with the additional workload of the entire country ?  They were a one off experiment remember....I will ask again.  Does anyone ever sit down and QA the logic in movies?  If anyone in the industry is listening - you guys need some major league help on the old plot logic thing.  I happily offer my services.",Null,0,0,27 August 2002
Gravity," Visually stunning - but little else to talk about
","Enjoyed the movie - great to look at, but there is so little to talk about afterwards. You can only say 'wow, that looked incredible' so many times. There is no character driven plot or development - other than two rather obvious clichés. Cynical astronaut who has been there, done that. Timid space newbie who has to wise up pronto to survive. There is also plenty of cheese here. In fact our journey home had us picking over the physics and continuity errors - of which there are a few. Never a good sign I think.Acting wise - Clooney has been a lot better than this - and has been given the job of perking the thing up. Bullock is OK - but nothing out of the ordinary. The picture will win possibly 4 Oscars - but none of the big prizes. Over -rated at 8 something.....will find its place among the late 6s in time....",7,1,3,27 October 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Entertained at times - but overall, disappointed.
","I took our two girls (aged 9 and 8 and suitably decked out as pirates) to see what was for us an eagerly awaited sequel. Over-all I was disappointed, but I wouldn't go as far as to say 'don't bother'.There are some great set pieces - that are amusing and well done. But the problem for me and my wife was that the film seemed to solely exist as a vehicle for these set pieces - with little or no attention to a narrative that reasonably took you from one to the next. This is something that the first film had going for it. The three-way sword fight was a great example of this - the motivations for why all three would now all want to kill one another - especially after the feeling of camaraderie at the end of the first film - was insufficient and unconvincing....Second point was that although it was over 2.5 hrs long it seemed 'rushed'... For us the film never really 'breathed'..and lines were 'spilt' out, rather than enjoyed...Third point I'd like to make is about Jack sparrow. In the first movie - despite appearing intoxicated most of the time - he was still clearly rather smart and had a sense of honour. In Dead man's chest he basically sells out William Turner - with no plan to return and rescue, and little sign of remorse... This is not the same man at all, and even a return to fight the Kraken at the end fails to make up for this for me... Plus - second time around the drunken word play, logic bits were verging on embarrassing I felt. I'm afraid the actor just didn't nail it for me this time around......or else maybe this character was only good for the one movie....Hell - there are some laughs, and as I say the set pieces are brilliantly done. The kids loved it of course, and although I wasn't as disappointed (make that angry) as I was after Matrix 2, I don't think this a worthy successor to what was a marvellously entertaining original.",5,2,3,9 July 2006
12 Angry Men," Superb
","Seen this one 12 times now - and never tire. Perfect acting - perfect script - superb economical ballet of juror prejudices and revelations. No2 to Shawshank in my book.....Claims that this is too liberal in outlook bear witness to the polarisation in US politics today. 12AM stands up against bigots, racists and ignorance. If this is liberal - then shouldn't we all be liberals? Fondas character represents everything that could be great about the united states. Sad to say the America of today is more represented by the other members of the jury.Today there is no room for ambiguity. Those courageous enough to be publicly un-certain - are mocked. This is a recipe for extremism. This is how innocent people die.",10,0,1,14 October 2004
The English Patient," Perfect, draining and stimulating
","Not much point adding to the praise already heaped on this movie.  I've read through a number of critiques and it seems that many are of the same opinions about this glorious film.  I was surprised to see a few negative points made though.  Two of which I'd like to address.'We disliked the film because I didnt like any of the characters' - or variations on this.  - This was an odd criticism I thought to make about a movie.  I don't think that I liked the main characters very much myself. Selfish people who pursued their passion at the expense of all others.  But for me, it was this that elevated the film to greatness since despite my feelings towards the lovers, I was still shattered by the ending.  I'm not sure you can criticise a movie because you don't like the characters portrayed within.  Seems a bit unfair.  This film just doesn't make any compromises to the modern taste.  The characters were honest ones, beautifully played and I didnt have to 'like' them.  The second class of comments I reacted to here were along the lines of - 'It was boring and tedious - nothing happens'.  This is so much more a reflection of the reviewer than of the film that I'm quite glad to see these comments here.  There are certain items of intellectual equipment that you need to appreciate this film, and sadly not everyone has them.  Perhaps not everyone wants them of course (certainly not governments!).  99/100 films are made for the lowest common denominator - (with the money to go to the cinema that is!).  Every so often, you get a film that requires the audience to 'think' and to have attention spans of more than the length of a Cola add.One of the greatest movies of all time.",10,2,4,15 January 2000
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Should have done Magicians Nephew first
","This review courtesy of someone who grew up in a house called 'Narnia' (replete with lamp-post in garden)- and as an adult who now owns a boat called 'Dawn Treader'. I guess I'm a bit of a Narnia nut in the same way that King Kong is a bit of a monkey. I read the Chronicles many many times as a child and I've recently had the pleasure of reading them all over again - to my own children.All of which means (a) I'm not very objective about the film - and (b) I had some major 'views' about how things ought to be done prior to the screening.For those out there with similar Narnia heritage I think you will be pleasantly surprised. I personally enjoyed the effort a lot - and on only a very few occasions did I sniff disapprovingly into my popcorn. The kids (9 & 7 respectively and with a mere single reading under the belts!) loved every minute of it.The good things. Lucy ( in looks a sort of mini Ann Widdecombe for all you UK politicos out there) was very good. Think the director must take a lot of credit for her performance. If Lucy had been bad, then this venture would have failed. Thankfully she shines. The others children I thought were a little ho-hum with Peter being the weakest.Tumnus was excellent - although our more cynical time applies some rather uncomfortable sinister overtones to the scenes with Lucy.Yes the Beavers were fun - as was the fox. Could have done with more explanation about the whole 'animals' talking thing though. It's remarked on rather too briefly I thought. (One of many problems with doing this book first instead of The Magicians Nephew - which explains the genesis of Narnia, how the animals start speaking and where the white witch comes from etc.) The White witch? - pretty good I thought, although maybe a little one dimensional. However I didn't like her 'home' which I felt as others have noted derivative and out of place in look and architecture to the rest of Narnia.Aslan - bang on. There is nothing CGI cant do now. (My brother and nephew wanted Aslan to be larger relative to other animals. My recollection of the book suggested he changed size to fit the occasion - so I had no problems myself) The stone table scene. Excellent and very true to the book.Now for those elements that were for me less good.The wood. Maybe I have the drawings from the books too much in mind - but for me the wood should have been darker, more canopied and claustrophobic. More like being in a wardrobe in fact. And I never felt a sense of size about the wood, or indeed the rest of Narnia. I felt the camera stayed too close the action - and we needed some longer shots. Especially felt in the first meeting with Tumnus - which in other regards was very nearly magical.The battle at the end. Okay so the charge of the Riders of Rohan is perhaps the most impressive film image of our generation - but it's not really what Narnia is about. I craved for something a little smaller in scale - a little more personal and intimate.The waterfall/ ice flow scene. Utter nonsense and superfluous to a story that hardly lacks for dramatic drive. Why he didn't just follow the story as written Ill never understand. The wolves weren't sinister enough in looks either - although I have to admit the 'Jaws' moment with Edmund was suitably scary.The game of cricket and broken window episode. Again - the story as written with the escape from the visitors party and Mrs McCready was subtler and more interesting.Okay - enough gripes. By and large I did enjoy the film and I look forward to the next. I have concerns that as a book Prince Caspian (which I always felt was the weakest) may not support a very interesting movie. I hope that there is commitment to do all of the rest - or at least as far as Dawn Treader - which I think will make a fantastic vehicle for a film....",7,21,35,11 December 2005
Finding Nemo," Fin-esse
","FN is a beautiful, touching and highly amusing story that will be enjoyed by millions for decades to come.  It's really too different to Toy Story 2 to make a fair apples 4 apples comp, but since TS2 is the benchmark here, I'll give it a go anyway.FN is better looking.  The detail is immense in every scene, and I suspect this alone has generated alot of second viewings from those (like myself) who want to make sure we didnt miss anything first time around.TS2 is funnier - or rather has a sharper ' more adult' sense of humour. FN has some laugh out loud moments, the seagulls in particular I thought were positively Aardman-esque.  But since the main Father/ son characters are actually not very funny at all - TS2 with Woody and Buzz just can't be beat. Plus some of the gags in FN seemed a bit rushed to me, and I sometimes felt I'd missed out on them.Voice-wise - call it a draw.  Special mention to Barry Humphries as a Vegetarian Shark.  Perfect, possums.Story.  Hmmmmm this is where the apples for apples thing gets much harder. Everything in TS1 and 2 was under-pinned by the constant fear of discovery by adults. It gave extra dramatic zest to every scene.  FN doesn't have the same backdrop - where action centres more often than not around avoiding being eaten.  This is often fun and exciting, but lacks the X factor of TS IMHO, and when the action stops, there's nothing there lurking in the background to keep the whole thing sizzling along.  This being said, I think that FN had a few nice messages for the younger and adult audience, and got them over without being the usual Disney blunt instrument.  Although the story was very linear - the relief of the Dentist's fish tank worked nicely.Overall - TS2 still the benchmark for this kind of movie - but FN is still an extremely attractive fun addition to the repertoire.  You will want to see it again I suspect on the big screen - if nothing else then for the sheer inventive detail of the Ocean environment.Looking forwards already to the next one in the pixar pipeline.....",8,0,1,30 August 2003
The Day After Tomorrow," Special effects 50 million, script 50 cents
","50 cents being the going rate for 11 year old script writers in Hollywood.I'll have to come clean and say that I was gripped. Mainly because a climate change such as this doesn't seem impossible somehow. However, the total is ruined (yet again) by a terrible plot that makes no sense. Now sometimes you can over look certain incongruities. But when the entire film structure depends on them - you can't see around them I afraid.SPOILERS Yet again we have the rather hackneyed contrasting parallel story lines - the one following the son 'staying put', and the other 'the father on rescue mission'. But putting the banality of this structure aside for one moment - we are led to believe that the father is rather bright. He's the only one to spot what's going on. He knows the storm will last 6 or 7 days - and he knows that to be caught outside is certain death. He tells his son to stay put and inside. Then what does he do? He sets off against the traffic while the storm rages. Duh?! He ends up killing his longtime partner, injuring another - and arrives a little before the helicopters - which if he'd waited back down south - he could have caught a ride with in the first place.What did he hope to accomplish by making this futile journey? What help would he be when he got there? Either the son was OK - or he wasn't - the eye of the storm didn't last that long remember. It's dumb dumb, dumb. Yes - okay it's a plot mechanism. But these still need to be rational. They need to make sense in the context of the characters as they are told to us.All that money on effects - and none on substance. Just once - you'd like them to invest in both.",5,8,17,27 February 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Caught up in the Star Wars thing again
","(because I wasn't after the Menace.)I enjoyed this one alot more than Episode 1.  There were actually some plot lines that weren't that obvious - and here and there a dash of ambivalence about the characters.  It was just enough to encourage some 'effort of thought' on the part of the watcher - to go with all the eye candy.  It is worrying to think that the 'complexities' of the plot might account for it's disappointing box office showing (as some have suggested).Some silliness along the way of course - I particularly enjoyed the moment when Ewan Mcgregor used the term 'south' to help position a planet in space. Most amusing.  The gratuitous, 'Im beside myself' gag was also quite unforgivable.....But for those who haven't seen it yet - do so.  It's not bad for all that. It looks superb, and I found myself caught up in the whole fairy tale once more.",Null,0,0,21 June 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," How could anyone score this a '1' ? - but over 1800 have...
","It's a long time since I saw 'The Godfather'.  A better movie than LotR(Part1)?  Probably, but there again I would pump for Shawshank as being No1 myself....  Godfather had tremendous style - Shawshank ...well had everything in my book. But what does LotR(Part1) have that puts it in the same bracket as these illustrious companions for so many people?It's extremely beautiful to look at.  It's well acted.  It is based on a great story.  It's got action, comedy, romance, violence etc....the works(...plenty of people of covered this already...).  Personally, I felt the inter cutting with the Gandalf/Saruman story worked very well - I didnt have a problem with the Glorfindel sex change.  The council of ELrond I think was a failure, but twas only a moment in the context of the whole.  The three hours flashed by - and Ill have to go and see it for a second time - not something Ive ever wanted to do before.  It makes a real impact - visually, and soundwise, and it is obvious why so many rate this one right up there.But (yup - there is a but coming), I was left with some feelings of disappointment come the end.  I had a feeling I was going to be after reading all the reviews on IMdb before going.  Nothing could live up to that kind of hype.  Most of my issues with LOTR(Part1) were that it was just that - a (part 1.).  You couldnt judge the book just reading the first book - nor can you do the same with the film.  The architecture of the story AS A WHOLE has breathtaking scope.  But taken in isolation the architecture of the first book just doesn't support the screen play for a film that well. There's no 'arch' shape - a going , a coming home.  Its more of a washing line - a series of events that occur on a journey.  Scary, beathtaking, beautiful to look at, and exciting events to be sure, but there would have to be more to warrant the top film award for me.At first - I was sad at this.  I really wanted this to be the Holy Grail of movies.  But then I thought about the next two, and that the film to judge would have to be the composite of all three.  I suspect that the next book the Two Towers has a better chance to stand on it's own feet as a movie, but the third will have the same problems as the Fellowship.  We shall see.It is an un imaginable prospect to sit down and see the three huge moveis back to back, but perhaps only then can we really see if the whole makes sense.  The first part is a great start, and I can only look forward with anticipation to the completed work",9,0,0,1 February 2002
Spider-Man," Is it a bird, is it a plane? No, it's a 12yr old script writer again.
","Special effects 10, script nil.  A great home win there for effects - and not a surprise result given recent form.  The script team went for numbers and youth again in an attempt to hit the right tactical combination, but once again their juvenile front line promised little and delivered laughable scene after scene.I don't think Dunst can act at the best of times, but no one with the lines she had to deliver was going to impress.  The funeral and hospital scenes must go down as the two most embarrassingly bad moments in this very weak movie.  How could the writers/ directors etc. listen to this and not squirm as lines a 12yr old girl would be proud of were delivered with technique that would shame a day time soap?  How ?And if anyone says that this was all a deliberate attempt to hit the 'comic book style' - they're deluding themselves.  Go see Superman if you want to see how it should be done.  At one point Dunst's character says she has been told she needs acting lessons.  How I wanted to scream out - ' Listen to them, girl.  They know what they are talking about'.  I suspect that this may have been a joke at Dunst's expense.....Please - will someone make the script the most expensive item in a film? - Just for once....?GRrrr",Null,0,0,10 June 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Trying ever so hard to be detached....
","..which of course is almost impossible when you've read the books 7 or 8 times.  But Ill try.Adaptation: 6.5Probably going to be my lowest score.  If there was one story that jumps straight from the page as a complete visual and dramatic entity then it's got to be this one.  Leaving scenes/ characters out is going to have to happen unless the finished film lasts 15 hrs or so, but there doesn't seem to be any need for inventing anything new.  Certainly no need for any new action scenes - so I took umbrage at the extra battle between Aragorn, the Riders and some mounted Orcs - and the subsequent 'is Aragorn alive or not' bit.  It's all new and just didnt work for me at all.  There was no tension there since it is obvious to one and all (even those who havent read the book) that the romantic lead is not going to be written out half-way through.  Aragorn lamely turns up again at Helm's deep and that's about it.As a general point to me it is also obvious whenever something non-Tolkein happens in the film.  There is a sudden lack of substance/ thud/ conviction. At first I thought this was born from my familiarity with the original story.  But to me there is a distinct lack of inspiration in the new scenes and the feeling that they don't belong to the original's overall architecture.I wasn't happy with the scene where Merry and Pippin manage to make it to Fangorn, and the preceeding running down of the orcs by the riders - which is so well described in the book I was looking for something rather more in the film than was delivered.  The book had a real sense of a race against the clock, with tension and action - more than enough for a good screenplay!Losing the extra Orc battle and Aragorn yawn bit and adhering more faithfully to the book would have improved things.  I conceed that adaptation must be a bit of a b*gger to do well.  Rather like flattening the biscuit tin lid - as soon as you flatten one bump, another one pops out somewhere else and you have to change that too..  etc.  Simple answer - don't fiddle - and especially don't fiddle purely to add action.  We have enough action already.Take the Faramir change/ Frodo to Osgiliath.  For one ghastly moment I was reminded of 'Reign of fire' - thankfully it passed, but it was a nasty reminder of what a narrow plank Jackson walks sometimes.  The book already had a quite simple distinction between Faramir and Boromir.  It was an important distinction that parallels the difference between the corrupt men who had been letting Middle earth slip, and those who would be entrusted with it's bright new future.  Jackson has blurred this - and I hope he's got a good reason for doing so.Theoden.  Hmmm, quite liked the concept of making him possessed by Sauruman. In the book, his negative and insular attitude is a result of years of subtle guidance from Wormtongue.  And I conceed this would have been hard to get across convincingly in a short space of time.  But in the book - when he snaps out of it - he snaps out of it for good.  In the film, he has some relapses in Helms deep.  THis didnt make alot of sense for me...Final remarks about the adaptation are on the two climaxes...  Ah yes, and of course you are right, you can;t have two climaxes can you.  In the book, space separates the flooding of Isengard from the Battle at Helms deep. THis gives each it's place and prominence within the drama.  In the film, JAckson cuts from one to another. (even though one happens mostly at Night, the other during the day.....?!)  As a result I believe the impact of both suffers.  Which is saying something because even with this weakness they are both fantastic.  But it's a bit like trying to flick between two channels - one showing 'Titanic', the other 'Waterloo'.  Marriages have foundered on such behaviour!ps Unlike some I wasn;t too worried about who turns up at the last minute at Helms Deep.  I sooo liked those Elven warriors that I kind of forgave Jackson that one.
Cinematography/ Costumes/ general look: 10Faultless - a yardstick for others to follow.  Particularly liked the elven warriors.  They had am impressive 'other worldly' quality about them. Gollum - utterly utterly perfect.  But Im not going to give Jackson all the credit for this.  The reason G has got almost universal approval from LotR officianados the world over is that he is one of the best described chararcters in all fantasy literature - and Jackson has just drawn him straight from the book.  Jolly good job too in my mind - since if G had been a failure - then so might the entire trilogy.Ents - pretty good.  Again could have really blown but they didnt.Isn't New Zealand a nice place ?!  Speaking as someone who has had the good sense to Emigrate here, it has always been easy to relate the geography here to Middle-earth.Riders? - Again about right.  Edoras was nicely Scandinavian I thought.Acting: 9The acting behind the CGI Gollum is spectularly good.  Not sure how the academy may view the achievement, but it's the standout performance for me.
Getting happier with Aragorn - and all the other cast members seem to be about right.  Wormtongue especially good - (Only minor quibble is Elrond. Every time he appears I hear 'That. Mr Anderson, is the sound of inevitability....'.  I just can;t stop myself....)Ps.  Hey - Im sorry but Treebeard and Gimili's voices were obviously one and the same.....
Script: 8Nothing too silly.  Enough lines taken direct from the book - even Gimili humour was done nicely and didnt pander.  I think we've lost alot of the poetry that is contained in the books.  But I guess we have the BBC radio series for this if we need it.Overall: 9As a standalone film 'Excellent' - and better than the 'Fellowship'.  But put this down to the better structure of the TT book than anything else. And in any case there is no way you can judge this or any of the Trilogy on it's own - especially if you have yet to read the books.In general, there was more additions than were necessary, and some missed opportunities.  Jackson was never going to keep everyone happy, but he's probably upset fewer than might have been expected given the passion that surrounds this work.As a final point - Ive never been to a movie that passed so quickly - or where the audience applauded at the end.  There are some of the most breath taking scenes ever filmed - and I'm personally very grateful that someone has so lovingly (and by and large faithfully) brought to life one of the great works of English literature.Judgement as a piece of film making - very good.",Null,0,0,11 January 2003
Mulholland Drive," Annoying pretentious rubbish
","Let me say straight up that there's nothing I like more than a film that insists you engage your brain.  MD however insists you engage brain and then take hallucinatory medication.  It starts out with memento-esque pretentions, but ends up being muddled and pretentious.I've read with extreme interest the plotlines as comprehended by other reviewers on this site.  Magnificent job the lot of you!  I reckon a hundred plots could be retro-fabricated to fit this endulgent swamp of dream and reality.  Yes - there could well be some very interesting and deep ideas in the there somewhere - but Im choosing to believe that if present - such moments were the product of chance on the part of the director.  In any case, you spend so much time trying to assess whether what you are seeing is real or not, that any message gets entirely lost.WHat about the music?  Was the score deep?  No.  The score was nothing - and like the rest of the film, drawn out, pretentious, stylised and lacking inspiration.A friend recommended this one to me - and since I nearly always agree with his choices, I can only think he thought I'd go for this one because of the lesbian sex scenes.  How shallow does he think I am?Never got around to watching Twin Peaks.  After this effort, Im thinking I've saved myself alot of pain.",Null,0,1,18 May 2003

Avatar," It's a terrible film - but go SEE it.
","Some have said here that Avatar has re-defined what movies are - that it even defines a whole new genre. Personally I enjoyed the experience very much and would recommend everyone go see it. But it certainly wasn't flawless, and it's flaws (for me) actually helped reaffirm what good films are all about.Films tell stories. Good films do so efficiently, rationally, while engaging us on an emotional level. They use visual and sound stimulus to do this - but these are means to an end, not the end itself.Avatar scores very moderately as a film. The proportion of production individuals tasked with the 'ends' (i.e. story/ script) versus the 'means' (i.e CGI) are telling. The plot logic crumbles with the lightest of analytical touches, and the overall eco-message is so crassly delivered that you even wonder whether this is a tremendously subtle counter-strike paid for by a mining cartel. With the exception of the Australians, no one has ever been this in-sensitive to indigenous rights.However, what the box office records for Avatar show is that humans remain interested in a 'damn good spectacle' - and the visual achievement of Avatar is unparalleled.It's a terrible film - but go SEE it.",5,2,10,22 January 2010
Groundhog Day," Love it
","Call me a sentimental old romantic - but I love this movie.  It's very very funny, original and you can watch it more than once and still really enjoy it.  Not many films fall into any of these categories for me - let alone all three.I guess the piano lessons was my favourite moment - but the 'deja vu' joke was right up there too. (Even though I'd thought I'd heard it before.....). Ok - so not the deepest movie you will ever see - but it has it's darker side.  Just one question in fact.  How does someone with such a bad complexion make it to be romantic lead opposite Andie Macdowell?",9,0,0,17 May 1999
The Matrix Reloaded," Unforgivably bad - re-hash
","The thing that I find utterly unforgivable about Matrix R - is not that it's bad.  (It is btw - really really bad) It is that it managed to spoil the first Matrix for me - which I felt was a bit special.  What we get in Reloaded is a chain of monstrous long action sequences with a load of incomprehensible techno-babble that tries to 'explain' the Matrix.Of course the Matrix was best left 'unexplained'.  All those possibilities that the first movie opens up to us - are slammed shut by this second effort.  Suddenly we are encouraged to really think rationally about the whole thing - and unfortunately the Matrix as a concept doesnt bear close scrutiny.Yes the action was impressive - well at least it was the first time around. After about a minute it just gets plain boring.  I've never seen so blatant a case of 're-use' in a movie - with producers desperate to ring every last cent out of their investment in the first film.  Hence we get the same fight mechanics - same baddies - same CGI with some sequences going on for ever (it seemed).  BORING !!!  RIP OFF!!!I wish I'd never seen it, and so preserved untainted the memory of Matrix 1.",2,0,0,30 May 2003
Love Actually," Not perfect, but funny and loveable.
","Yes - it probably was a little long. Yes - the sandwich-boy story was perhaps un-neccessary Yes - First time director Curtis didn't do a perfect job of cutting between plot lines...But it is extremely well written, has some excrutiatingly funny moments and presents at least four plot lines each of which could support an entire film all on their own.The score of 7.9 doesn't lie - and for those made doubtful by the few negative comments recorded here - consider that a large number of the 'knockers' thought that Matrix reLoaded was a good film.(Ive checked).If that doesn't call into question such assessment then I don't know what does.Go on - stop being cynical for an evening and enjoy yourself.",Null,0,3,1 December 2003
The Green Mile," David Morse - was it just me that thought he stole the show?
","Not to be compared with Shawshank Redemption - completely different bag of apples - but still very good in its way.  The GM is a very short 3 hrs +. It entertains but doesnt have anything very much to say.  Good acting, all were good, but David Morse for me stole every scene.  The respect he had for Tom Hank's character - love even, shone through every minute.I noticed that a fellow contributor described the 'bad guard' as 'mean spirited'.  Boy were you ever watching a different movie - or maybe you had a vocabulary failure ?  No, for me he made the governor in Shawshank look like a girl guide.",9,0,0,1 April 2000
Inception," Over blown and over rated
","Don't believe the hype on this one. Its not a bad movie and has some interesting ideas. But its not the birth of a new religion - as some would have it. How this is mentioned in the same sentence as the 'Kings Speech' is beyond me.In general Im delighted to see any attempt to muck around with the usual narrative sequence or which mixes dream with reality. Mememto was a staggering film and I loved the Matrix 1.But after some early promise of mind altering visuals - the majority of the film was played out in what were disappointingly normal landscapes. They reminded me of conventional bond movie sets than anything else. Where was the Escher stair case? Where was the warping of physics? I felt a little let down to be honest. It was only when we reached level four that I became a little more engaged and impressed.The story line itself I felt badly cluttered with too many explanations of the mechanics of invading dreams. It was nearly always noisy and the dialogue often muffled. This made it hard to follow - (and yes, my hearing is fine and I have a state of the art Theatre system) But the really disappointing thing was that with a concept as subtle as invading peoples dreams and planting new ideas - we had to have gun fights all over the place. Frankly the crassness of the shoot outs clashed rather awkwardly with some intelligent ideas about the nature of reality. And why did all the baddies have 'A-team' shooting accuracy? Last point - wouldn't it have been rather easier to persuade the target to do what they needed him to - through non-dream means?",6,7,11,4 February 2011
Step Up," Step down
","Rubbish. A plot that was as predictable as it was banal. A script that was both embarrassing and clichéd. Acting that almost defied belief in it's badness.Yes - it's a dance movie. But no - that isn't a licence to forgive it's drawbacks. Was there anyone who watched this who after 10 mins wasn't certain of the plot and final outcome? Boy from wrong side of the sticks meets middle-class girl. One is an untrained but talented street dancer, the other a formally trained ballerina. They get together - and end up assisting each other to make the 'step up'. And it all culminates in a big show that blends together the two styles and catapults both up the greasy dance pole (so to speak). Now how long did that story take to work out? I was made to see this on a very uncomfortable flight from Frankfurt to Osaka. At the time - I didn't imagine the flight could get any worse - I was so very very wrong.....It made me want to step 'out' - not up.",2,4,5,26 February 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Say 'friend' and enter
","Comments on the now completed film - not just ROTK.
Say 'friend' and enter, else let your prejudice prevent your respecting what is categorically the greatest cinematic achievement to date.Imagine having the arrogance to believe that you have the vision and imaginative energy to put together a ten hour film that does justice to the seminal work of fantasy literature.....  Take a step back my cynical friends and measure this extraordinary accomplishment against the mountains of uninspired patronizing Holywood rubbish with which we are daily assailed.Consider the sheer hotspur and determination required to see the work to it's conclusion and to remain consistent and steadfast to the vision over many years.  Think of the thousands of actors and technicians with whom you must have the energy and communication skills to share your vision.No.  No one has come close to this as an achievement.  Even if the end product were merely 'so so', I'd be saying the same thing.  But regardless of the quibbles that you are bound to have with something this provocative - Jackson's 'The Lord of the Rings' is a far better movie than anything this long has a right to be.LOTR is comparable in breadth and success with Wagner's Ring Cycle, or the Michaelangelo's Sistine Chapel and with Tolkien's original novel of course. To bring together convincingly all the elements required to make the film a success is no less a worthy achievement than these 'gesumptkunstwerk'.Many criticisms arise from judging the three movies separately.  This is incredibly unfair imho. The ending of ROTK is not too long when considered the end of a ten hour movie.  Similarly, the final Opera of Wagner's Ring cycle is fairly pointless without the proceeding three, and is rarely performed or judged on it's own.  (Now Im not a Wagner nut myself - but this doesn't stop me from appreciating what is an incredible work of art.)  
It's a shame that small, rather petty prejudices - born often out of loyalty to other movies as much as basic 'fantasyphobia' - prevent some (a tiny minority for sure) from appreciating the film for what it is.I'd ask the cynics to take the time and effort to stand back and admire LOTR from an objective distance.  For some this is a long walk.  However the view, like the location in which it was shot, is breathtaking.",10,0,0,11 January 2004
Happy Feet," Extremely good - and not too preachy at all.
","I've read a number of negative comments out there about HF being too preachy. For those yet to see the film - don't let this put you off. HF is fast, funny, clever, witty (musically) and visually stunning.Yes - there are a few messages about over-fishing, and how this is a bad thing - and that (,this just in...,) it's humans who are the perpetrators ! Im not sure that this is a theme you could possibly over-fish myself - and it was as palatably presented here as anywhere else I've seen. My 8 and 10 year old girls were not patronised, and as adults, my wife and I did not feel we were back in church.Anyway back to the real themes of the movie. The power of both music and dance to cross cultural and language divides - and the importance of being different. When so much of world culture is being watered down to a brown mush - and the pressure to conform is so strong in some countries that children commit suicide rather than suffer being different - HF raises some excellent points. The main character's 'difference' is what saves the entire colony. HF says diversity is important - and having the courage to be different in the face of massive peer pressure is the real message of this movie.A few points about the music. From the opening strains (taken from Abbey road) - to the last, HF has a thumping good score with plenty of cleverness. The scenes of penguins musically trying to find a partner with an empathetic theme are extremely well done. A lot of melodies were placed in counterpoint (inter-twined with another), with sometimes four or five ideas going on at the same time. Ill be getting the DVD for this alone I think. This scene happens twice - but the second time we have the melody being counterpoint to the tap dance rhythm from Mumble. Superb.The last idea I took from HF was the power of both dance and music to communicate across the divides. Rather than the inexplicably negative conclusion that some have come to in reviews here - I took great optimism from the fact that humans were in the end able to relate to the penguins, and decide to stop their bad old ways.A fine movie - one that both adults and children will enjoy.",9,7,10,27 December 2006
Contact," Worm Holes - Plot Holes
","Annoying.  Over all I couldn't help liking this one alot. I like escapism - and wouldn't mind escaping to the Vega system sometime....But there's a  big but (and Im not just talking Jodie F here...).  How can anyone suspend disbelief in the face of such a stupid and illogical ending? **Spoilers**Point the first.  So at the end - that's it is it ?  You spend billions putting a potential portal across the universe, and you run it just the once ? Plllllease! Given that there was at least some promising feedback from the first person to attempt, I think you'd probably bother to try it again with someone else to corroborate, wouldn;t you ?  Point the second.  The first time you run it - (and when you know that time is going to be a big factor here), are you telling me no one thinks to install some pretty sophisticated time measuring equipment inside the capsule (hey!, a watch would have done it folks...)?? (But heck - they remembered to put in a chair, so that's okay isn't it..)Point the third.  Wouldn't someone as smart as JF's character is meant to be a) think of taking some sand back with her from Vega or b) think  about the length of video static recorded. I'd have been pretty desperate to think of something that proved my story myself...I do so hate this sort of thing - but it's particularly irritating in a movie about science.  I've not read the book - perhaps someone can tell me if this has the same holes in it. Probably not.",Null,0,2,5 August 2001
Shark Tale," Compared with it's illustrious peers - very average
","Spurred to write after reading the rather blatantly biased front page user comment....In no way should this movie be mentioned in the same breath as Nemo, Toy Story, Shrek 2, Ice Age etc. It's not in their league - or should that be fathom? It lacks 'wit' and subtlety and tries waaaay too hard to be fast and funny - when it's actually neither. It's bland and very forgettable.The storyline was un-original and linear - the characters stereo-types. I winced at each 'fish related' gag - and found the main character annoying. The whole was predictable and ironically - colourless.I think that the energy of this medium wains. The wow factor of the comp. animation has worn off - and the focus falls more and more on the storyline and characters. It's not enough to pack each scene with visual detail and hire charismatic voice-overs. Ice age was a lesson that less can be more - and it's a shame that Sharks Tale didn't work this out. They thought underwater detail and light effects and a few fin-gags was all that was needed. Not for this viewer it isn't.What bothers me is that this is top of the box office in the states. Hoping they have a school holiday over there at the moment....Is it me - or does the lowest common denominator get lower and lower each year?",5,0,3,12 October 2004
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Down to the river I go
",A joyful imaginative treat.  O Brother contains some of the most memorable scenes of any film Ive seen.  Visuals and sound track stunning.  Not everything works - but I guess this happens when envelopes are being pushed - but when stuff does come off - boy does it come off.  Just two scenes for example :  Down to the River - where the congregation all in white walk past our heros in the wood singing.  Sheer bloody magic !!!  (I wished the sound track CD used choir as in film....shame...).  Second scene has to be the Constant sorrow reprise and George Clooney's dance near the end.  Total joy- makes yur heart glad sort of stuff.Im not going to pretend I know my Odyssey - but I will read it now - and re-watch 'O Brother'....replete with slicked hair and a gopher on a stick....,Null,0,0,19 October 2001
