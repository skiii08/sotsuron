Hereditary," Just say no
","I love Toni Collette and she's the only reason this gets any stars from me.It started off strong and I was super hopeful. It dragged a bit through the middle, but the story seemed like it was going somewhere. The first hour and a half was okay and then BAM! a whole lotta wtf. I'm so sick and tired of 'artsy' crap movies. Don't tell me I 'didn't get it.' I got it and it was stupid.Don't waste your money.",4,523,1016,9 June 2018
