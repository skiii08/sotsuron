Skyfall," Just awful
","This is SO not Bond.Bond is a movie tradition, a sexy gentleman spy who drinks martinis, goes to bed with girls, and uses smart gadgets.The 'Bond' in Skyfall is a middle aged man who drinks Heineken, goes to bed with both sexes, and doesn't use smart gadgets.I don't think anything of this is sexy. And as a woman, I would not want to bed a man, who is also attracted to men.People who say 'Bond is back' obviously disregard everything that defines Bond. He isn't back. This is not a 50 years celebration, this is a 50 years 'You're fired'.People who say 'Best Bond ever' - if you don't like real Bond, why don't you watch something else. Why go to a Bond movie and then praise that Bond isn't Bond anymore?",1,28,59,7 November 2012
