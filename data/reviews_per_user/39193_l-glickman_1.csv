Black Swan," So very disappointed
","Words cannot describe how much I disliked this film. I disliked the camera work, I disliked the script, I disliked the performances, and I disliked the manipulative and needless use of graphic displays of sexuality and physical effects of dancing. You may read that and think that I am an ultra conservative movie goer, that is not the case, I just felt that Aronofsky included such graphic scenes for fun, but this certainly did not move the plot or movie along.I actually found myself being angry at this movie!Now, don't get me wrong. My degree is in film study, and I very much appreciate what Aronofsky is trying to do in Black Swan. I appreciate a film maker who makes bold, inventive movies, but for so many reasons, I found Black Swan to be (as my kids might say) an Epic Fail.",2,13,49,20 December 2010
