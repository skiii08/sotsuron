Hereditary," it is horror tension movie
","For all the one star reviewers, please, use your brain from time to time, not everything is slasher and running around with knife. Yes, the movie is not 10 or masterpiece, however it creates a tension and dark atmosphere. It is a good movie with good acting, enjoyable with some quite surprising moments. Solid 7.",7,1,6,10 June 2018
Us," Not bad at all
","Actually, was surprised for the better. This movie is getting too much hate. Yes, not perfect, but quite original and kept me interested. Not everything was completely clear, but very suspenseful. Don't compare it to Get Out, and you will enjoy it very much.",8,0,4,24 May 2019
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Funny especially who knows about Eurovision
","I had to give it at least 9. I am sure many non Europeans, especially Americans may not find it very funny. But growing up with it , i think it is pretty good parody on this ridiculous competition.
Yes, it is not sophisticated humor, but literally hits some of the so obvious characteristics of Eurovision (like over the top wardrobe and singing,lol).
So don't take it too seriously and enjoy the ride.
And by the way, Eurovision gave us ABBA which is still pretty cool even nowadays...Dancing queen, anyone?",9,1,5,27 June 2020
Bohemian Rhapsody," Worth the watch
","I give it 8 out of 10. In overall, it was a good not amazing movie until the LiveAid end. This saved it from being 7. I must agree somewhat with critics: it was lacking something, however just listening to Queen music and then end it with LiveAid made it much better. The ending made the movie more meaningful in many ways. Another negative point for me, a fun of Queen who knows a bit about the band history: I think Rami is a great actor, but he doesn't look like Freddie! the eyes are different and the british accent was not natural. So i was struggling with the physical likeness of Freddie to Rami, Freddie was more attractive, sorry. But on the other hand it is also very difficult to play Freddie since Rami is still short of charisma that Freddie had. However, in LiveAid portion he still did a very good job. So, overall, it is emotional biopic, worth the watch, but could be slightly better.",8,2,4,4 November 2018
The Favourite," Good movie not for everyone
","This is well done history based movie by my favorite director. After the Dogtooth and The Lobster he is on my top list. BUT it is definitely not for everyone, so if you appreciate a different take on movie making, you will agree with high ratings. As for soundtrack: people, this is 18 century!, sure you don't expect hip pop or salsa as a music background. I think it was almost perfect, and actually first time describes favouritism when talking about queens rather than kings that had million lovers. Very unique movie.",9,3,7,9 December 2018
Cold War," Beautiful to watch but lacks in story telling or connection
","I agree with many reviewers here. It is beautiful cinematography, but the story is loose and doesn't make sense or engage you enough. It left me cold and more than that, the female was really irritating.
I understand what the director was trying to say: i came from that region too, but some story lines don't make sense. As patriotic as you can feel, you don't choose communistic Poland or any communist country over amazing Paris (especially when you are an artist) AND leave your soulmate behind. That is why many people were trying to escape. May be she was nostalgic or couldn't connect emotionally to French culture, as an artist? It is not very clear from the script.
In overall, she was pictured as spoiled selfish 'femme fatale' that ruined their chance for happiness while he has weak personality, that sacrifices his life and freedom for ungrateful partner. May be this is unconditional love? I didn't find her attractive either for some reason, while he fits the part better. For me, unlike Ida that was amazing, this is only 6/10.",6,68,95,22 December 2018
Midsommar," should be classic
","I was so impressed. I am sure that not everybody will agree with me. But starting from visuals and including the slowly building tension, to me it was perfect. The movie is full of symbolism and it is hardly your general horror flick. If you are waiting for gore, slasher, scary, pass on it. But if you enjoy sinister type of film, like Rosmary's baby (no, the plot is not the same), then it is masterpiece. Highly recommend if you like slow burn creepy staff...",10,14,29,3 July 2019
Jojo Rabbit," a little gem
","Beyond excellent. WWII and Nazi is such a tragic subject to deal with. Nevertheless, movie succeeded to make it warm, funny and very emotional. It is ' Life is beautiful' kind of movie. Highly recommended.",10,4,9,25 December 2019
