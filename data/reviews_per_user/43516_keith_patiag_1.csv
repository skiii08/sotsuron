Source Code," Mind Blowing
","This movie was so intense and mind blowing that I had to register on this site (IMDb) to write this review! Great movie, was slow and confusing at first but ultimately kept you on the edge of your seat. Yeah some parts kept repeating but it was so unique how this movie was put but in the end it left me satisfied and mind blown.I was interrupted a few times during this intense movie but to tell you the legit truth about my experience is this. One time I was interrupted after an intense scene. I had to pause the movie and I was angry and upset that I was interrupted but I needed to drop my sister off to work so when I was backing up I was feeling so careless and upset because of all the interruptions. As I was backing up I felt like my mind was in the concepts of the movie. I felt like if I made a mistake and I died in a car crash, I could wake up and retry. You will see if you haven't seen the movie what I meant. It left me mind blown.",10,2,3,27 July 2011
