The Incredible Hulk," It all works, except.....SPOILER
","EWWWW.. Get out of my face Tim Roth...Tim Roth was awful. His old-man, rode hard put away damp and mildewy appearance and his pathetic attitude was a real spoiler for me. The Abonmination was an improvement over that weirdo. Sorry Tim, but you got a face that could stop a train and a body that needs a LOT of work. I loved the beginning in Brazil, having lived and worked there, I recognized the favellas immediately. My big question is what is Banner doing at the end? Hulking out in the wilds of British Columbia for kicks? I guess if I had that power, I'd green-man from time to time just to feel big and bad and swole! William Hurt follows the same driven, cycloptic militarist minded General that Sam Eliot did in 2003, inlcuding bad acting and a gruff almost unintelligible voice. And I kept looking for elf ears on Liv Tyler. She was seen so much during the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, I feel her face has been typecast as an elf. All in all, a bit of an improvement on the 2003 Ang Lee epic, but Eric Bana is a lot easier on the eyes than Ed Norton any day. Can't wait for Captain America!!!",9,2,4,10 July 2008
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Stands the test of time.
","A friend and I went to see ET today (3-25-02)and although I had reservations that I would enjoy this movie again, I was pleasantly and wonderfully surprised. You have to figure age has something to do with my reaction, after all ,when the movie first came out, I was only 27.   Maybe it's the fact that I saw the movie through mature eyes, but I was moved.  The children were great as usual, but the most important thing was ET itself..I never noticed how lifelike he was..his eyes, his expressions, his fingers, his fire hydrant body..all so charming and entertaining. The print we saw was a bit faded, the exterior shots were washed out, and the interior shots all had a yellowish cast to them.  I am wondering if it was the theater, or was it impossible for the studio to get a pristine print.  The special effects extras that were promised, were not noticed by us. All in all, a wonderful revisiting of a movie from a bygone age, when fantasy films took imagination, not computer memory to produce.",Null,0,0,25 March 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Hang on to your gold matees, it's gonna be a bumpy night!
","Well, what can I say.. Johnny Depp, looking like Alice Cooper meets the Scarlet Pimpernell meets Bob Marley and sounding like Oscar Wilde after too much absinth plays Jack Sparrow the overthrown captain of a band of cuthroats. The mutinous pirates are now led by a deliciously ruthless Captain Barbosa played to the teeth by Geoffrey Rush. They are in search of the final pieces of Cortez'zzzzzz Aztec Gold so they can lift the curse of Moctezuma and stop running around in a disheveled pirate vessel known as the Black Pearl.  All it takes is some special ingredient and the curse will be lifted and the guys can go around carousing and raping and pilaging and enjoy the whole thing rather than spend eternity as unsatisfied and perpetually ticked-off skeletal spooks.  Orlando Bloom plays a blacksmith Will Turner who has a bit of pirate in him and wonders why, and Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth, daughter of the Governor who knows why. 
All in all good squash-buckler of a film that has little to do with the ride of the same name save one scene in Tortuga which looks remarkably like the raping and pilaging that goes on in the Disney attraction. The skeletal capuchin monkey was a nice touch. makeup gets high marks, although Depp should be hung for his excessive use of eye shadow and sparkle disco glitter..come on Johnny, who are you fooling?Apparently the music by Klaus Badelt, was a direct RIP OFF of Gladiator, because Klaus Badelt did the incidental music for Gladiator.  What did you think Klaus, no one would notice? So if you ignore the music stolen from another film, Pirates is good fun.  Not a keeper, but fun just the same.",Null,2,4,10 July 2003
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," More like...the passion, the dogma and the gospel.
","Hated it. The story is simple.. good against evil, the backdrops are all stock Lord of the Rings settings. The climactic battle between the armies of the White Witch and those of Aslan clash on Pelinore Field, the mountain in the background missing the white towers of Minas Tirinth. yes, the animals are wonderfully conceived CGI, the centaurs weren't all that great, and the head centaur was downright ugly. I love Turkish delight! My father used to buy it at the local foreign grocery in Miami when I was a kid. I wouldn't be tempted by a witch producing a whole plate of the stuff.. too sweet.Tilda Swinton was the only saving grace of this pedantic, lumbering and altogether molasses-like movie. She captured the essence of the White Witch. The Einsteinian time travel stuff is a nice touch but I ask you this.. what happened to the whole kingdom when all four of the heads of state suddenly vanish one fine afternoon? Also, Jim Broadbent (Topsy Turvy) was underused.Now, as to the Christian bent, it was painfully obvious. At one point, Aslan says 'It is finished', a direct reference to the last words of Christ on the cross. I was less offended by the obvious references to the Gospel than by the vain attempts to conceal and camouflage the other dogma(too numerous to mention here, and frankly I don't want to go into it)I am sure this film and its progeny will please the same crowd that paid tribute to Caesar to see The Passion of the Christ, but those of us who saw the penultimate good v. evil story brought to the screen (Lord of the Rings et al) will probably not be among the future ticket buyers.",1,3,11,1 January 2006
Finding Nemo," Piscatorial Panache
","Pixar has served up another platter full of treats in this marineland version of The Incredible Journey.  This time it's an overprotective father looking for his fearless but missing son encountering all manner of wonders and wonderful sea creatures perfectly voiced by such top-notch personae as Ellen DeGeneres, Geoffrey Rush, Albert Brooks, Willem Dafoe,Dame Edna, Eric Bana and Allison Janney.  The underwater imagery is fantastically detailed and amazingly realistic.  Pixar seems to do what few studios can, learn from what works and not be afraid to explore new digital territory in a laudible desire to be more realistic.  This is the penultimate Pixar, the aquatic acme, the picean peak..dare I go on.  In a clamshell, the movie is stunningly beautiful and appeals to all audiences, although I would have liked to see the movie sans-enfants..maybe I can find a 10:30 PM show? go, no RUN to see this film..you won't be sorry.",Null,0,0,12 June 2003
Brokeback Mountain," An emotional washboard that will wring you out, but it's worth it.
","Ang Lee has taken a short story of few words and made it into a monument of deep feeling and sensitivity that will stand as one of the finest films to deal with 'the love that dare not speak its' name'. Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) is a cowboy of few words, yet his body language, his face and movements speak volumes to Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal)a man ready to set up house and live happily ever after at the drop of a hat. Unfortunately for Twist, Ennis is so haunted by a childhood incident, that the mere sharing of a grope or kiss or wink in public is anathema and must be done with frequent glancing around to make sure jaundiced eyes aren't watching. The result is an angst filled anxiety roller-coaster that causes Ennis to withdraw from life into a beer bottle and Twist to wish for a different 'happy ending' to his life story, house and home, warm fire in the hearth and a Marlboro man to love till the cows come home. The film is full of cherished lines and situations because neither character is a font of conversation. Ledger speaks his lines from behind clenched lips, holding back imaginary chew juice, even though he smokes cigarettes and never spits. Gyllenhaal uses those amazing bedroom eyes to convey the deep love he has for Del Mar. He takes the good with the bad, the bitter with the sweet, but increasingly bitter times lie ahead for both of them. This is a classic love story of two men who married, had children, lived separate lives, but came together to share the only real love they ever knew. The wives, the kids are all incidental to the rapids whitecap-ping constantly between Jack and Ennis. Some may find this behavior selfish and immoral, but to the end, Brokeback Mountain transcends this prejudice and shows us what was probable, but never possible because of a hateful society that surrounds the characters. I highly recommend this movie to anybody with an open mind and a heart. Bravo.",10,19,22,18 December 2005
Ocean's Twelve," WHY? N o plot spoilers, just complaints..
","The movie was a great sequel to an equally great remake, but the music was BAD. Be VERY afraid of this soundtrack. There were moments when I thought a bunch of needles were being raked across my eyes during the music. Whoever made the soundtrack should be dangled by his lavalier from a lamppost on the Chams Elyses. Trying to sound very 60's eurotrash brass ensemble via early Avengers and James Bond music, the soundtrack comes off to shrill, painful and all around nauseating. The music insults the senses. Go with ear plugs and you will be happy.By the way.. can Elliot Gould's glasses get any bigger? I would love to own a pair of those cinemas-cope peepers..talk about stereoscopic vision.",Null,1,2,2 January 2005
Pan's Labyrinth," This is not the movie it is purported to be....
","MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD...Rather than give us a dark fantasy about a young girl in a quest for the truth, the director gave us a blood-soaked horrific social commentary on the struggle of the partisans against the fascistas in World War II Spain. The fantasy allegory is only briefly touched on during the movie, with wonderful snippets of movie magic, the faun is particularly effective and well-played. The rest of the time people are being shot, stabbed, cut up, blown up and otherwise killed. I would not have gone to see this movie if I knew in advance the majority of the film was so visually unappealing. Children should NOT be allowed to see this film under any circumstances. I honestly don't see what all the hoopla is about, and I couldn't see giving any applause let alone 23 minutes reportedly given at Canne.",4,0,10,3 February 2007
Capote," Tour de force for Hoffman- Mild spoilers, as if you don't know the story already.. come on!
","If Phillip Seymour Hoffman does not get the Oscar for best actor, there is no justice. His total immersion portrayal of the brilliant but haunted child-like genius writer Truman Capote is a living homage to the late author. I sat in a small venue, so mesmerized was I that I was leaning forward in my seat propping an elbow on the back of the seat in front of me. I was with a friend, and the theater was lightly occupied. You could have heard a pin drop in there. Even the munching of popcorn or slurping of soda was kept to a minimum, nobody wanted to miss a line, or be distracted and miss a gesture.The laughter from the audience was genuine, not mocking and very savvy. I was in a good group that afternoon.The angst and dread and anxiety and the conflicting emotions of pride and revulsion mixed liberally with a sexual undercurrent so strong you would feel like being in a rip-tide, yet he knows his subject matter must die in order to fulfill his destiny as the first writer of 'true crime' genre nonfiction.You can taste the drinks, smell the cigarettes, see the depression overwhelm him as he realizes he must hope for death to consummate evolution to another level of creativity.Interestingly, the color treatment of this film cleverly intersperses with stark high-contrast lighting to simulate black and white like the gory crime scene pictures or the press and publicity stills taken for the book, In Cold Blood.I hate to say this, but Robert Blake will always be Perry Smith to me, even though Clifton Collins, Jr. does a marvelous job translating the child-like friendliness and simmering rage inside this cold blooded killer. Blakes Smith will always seem a bit more sensitive, terrified and at the same time exhilarated and turned-on by the whole spectacle of his murderous self-immolation.The scene showing Smith staring out a grate in the wall to watch 'Andy', the best boy in Kansas, swollen with self-indulgence waddling out to the 'corner', trying to beat the rope by weighing enough to break it is a great homage to the original Blake 'In Cold Blood'. I thought the forklift for his corpse a nice touch.This is a marvelous snippet of time, expanded and stretching the emotional fabric of the period in Capote's life to grab our attention and keep it wrung out like a wet rag....cold and damp, creepy almost but riveting, like a bloody auto accident. You can't look at it, and you can't look away.Totally Awesome.",10,2,2,12 December 2005
