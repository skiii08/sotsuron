Angels & Demons," Worst movie ever
","A horrible, slow, illogical, boring movie that made almost no sense whatsoever. If the bio-matter is going to blow up the whole city then why haven't detectives investigated who broke into the lab, then track that guy down, and recover the bio-matter bomb? It seems that the whole vatican police force is angry with the Hanks character, so why would he even bother staying and trying to help?Why does the Hanks character fumble around looking for the earth, fire, water, air statues for hints to finding dead priests and answers to how they were killed instead of just trying to find the bomb and save the city?The power going out in the airtight book vault was hilarious. There would be enough air in that room for them to breathe for a week, but they were gasping for air almost immediately. Those books were supposed to be priceless, yet they used the bookcase to try to break out, then of course the the power came back on.The bomb seemed to be described to be more powerful than a nuclear bomb so taking it up a couple thousand feet in a helicopter would only make it more effective in destroying the city. There's no auto-pilot in choppers and nobody ever parachutes out of them. Also wouldn't everyone with any common sense take cover from the expected bomb blast? I cannot imagine anyone enjoying this movie.",1,20,34,3 December 2009
