Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," good but not great
","after viewing the movie for a second time. I really enjoyed the special effects and fight scenes. It seemed silly with the fight scene, when darth maul and liam say nothing at all, you would figure that liam would be interested in the sidth interest are. The characters seem to drag especially when jar-jar is placed in ridiculous situations, just as the ewokies did; which takes away from the movie as a whole. Although i will buy it when it comes out on dvd.",Null,0,1,23 June 1999
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," A decent follow-up
","Good action, good suspense, and fairly decent acting for the price of admission.  Weak points claire danes, rehash of old terminator sequences and cutting of the film. How do they get into a top secret lab? Looks like the dvd will answer the questions of who, what, where, why. Next story line will be living with the machines...",8,0,0,6 July 2003
