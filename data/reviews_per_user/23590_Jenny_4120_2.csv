Skyfall," Tarminator?
","At the beginning of the film Bond is shot in the chest. Minutes later he receives a new bullet from an assault rifle. Then he falls from high enough to break bones and rupture organs. Is he dead? Nope. He is stronger than Indiana Jones and Terminator. Is not too much even for Bond? This time it's getting even worse than Quantum Of Solace. The story is lame, the nonsense plot is build around a melodramatic inside view of Bond's psyche. O.K., when Bond is no bigger than life daredevil anymore, it seems to be a logical consequence, to let the audience learn more about the 'true' psyche of Bond. The real Bond is a classical archetype male and a chauvinistic, arrogant womanizer with a very dangerous job (secret agent), no woman can withstand although she knows what a heart breaker he is. This worked for 40 years and would have worked for another 40 years or so. The Bond we knew until Craig appeared might not be the type of man radical left-wing Eco- activist broads would like to welcome to their sit-in. Fact is, the real Bond is dead!This is a private version of Mrs. Broccoli's fantasy Bond 008, a guy who deeply comprehends women instead of bumping them before they can count to three (which might be a challenge for some real Bond girls...). Of course it's intended not to be 'your dirty old father's' Bond. It's a Bond for the masses not for the classes, offering a bit of everything the average movie goer under 20 (Twilight-fans) might want to consume.Craig's Bond has become a sissy, who has a complex oedipal relationship to elder women, especially to those he calls 'M'. Now, in Skyfall, we will learn that 'M' is for 'mother'... There really was no need to change the Bond franchise so completely, except to squeeze out some dollars more out of the franchise.

Drive," This is why I love films
","This film is just one of those movies that wakes you up because of its uniqueness and makes you realize that not all movie scenes and plots you can expect. Almost every movie out there, are so predictable. You can judge a movie based on how many explosions there are, or if there's a love affair, how it'll turn out in the end. The fact is, however, the movie 'Drive' follows more of an unconventional, yet more realistic plot. I won't say what happens, but just know that it's not what you think. In my viewing of the movie, I knew right off the bat that I couldn't expect a single thing to happen. I was sucked into the movie because I had to know what was going to happen. To my surprise, what actually happened was neither what I expected nor what I didn't expect. Up until the end of the movie, the movie itself was playing with my mind, telling me 'this is how it is' not 'this is how you would have wanted it'. I enjoyed it immensely, and I hope other viewers will do the same, if they haven't already.",Null,3,4,29 January 2013
