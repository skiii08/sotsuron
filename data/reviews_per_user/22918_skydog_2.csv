Alien 3," splatter freaks don't get it
","Anyone else get into the intense gothic atmosphere of this little film? I dug it. Great environment, and mood. Thought it was a fitting contrast to the repetitive tropes of the first two Alien films. I didn't need more of that. By contrast, Alien Ressurrection is a totally misguided piece of garbage. Alien 3 should have been the end. But like the main theme of modern sci-fi, the beast just doesn't know when to stop",8,0,4,24 January 1999
Alien: Resurrection," Travesty
","Awful film, a tired self-parody. Winona Ryder a joke. Ripley without a soul left. The mutated baby monster laughable. All the cliches of the series trotted out and hammed up. Pathetic. I'm one of the decided minority who think Alien3 is literate and engaging, a worthy successor to the first two. 'Resurrection' just squeezing the last bit of juice out of the concept.",1,7,15,23 January 1999
