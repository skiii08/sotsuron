Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," This is one of the WORST MOVIES I have ever seen
","Once a friend of mine asked me to go to cinema with him and he told me he wants to watch Borat. I thought 'Oh my God, how can an intelligent man watch such a crappy film?' But hey, he's a friend of mine so I went with him, but it was exactly what I expected. One of the WORST FILMS I HAVE EVER SEEN.This movie is so disgusting and disturbing in most of the scenes. If a guy like Borat would come to my house, I would hit this piece of **** in the face kick him away.Just terrible. Just terrible.If you're intelligent, don't watch this film. This is a movie for stupid people, for people who are mentally damaged.Unfortunately I can't give 0 out of 10, so it will be 1 out of 10, but it deserves much less.",1,6,13,3 December 2006
