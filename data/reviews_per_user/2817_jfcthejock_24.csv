The Incredible Hulk," A Decent Superhero Fantasy
","Well what can I say, this is an age of mediocre fantasy films and tales of superheroes and many do not yield to become good films. The Incredible Hulk is without a doubt a success, maybe due to the fact that they casted Edward Norton as the big, mean, green monster or maybe unlike the Eric Banner film of the same name back in 2003 it has a good plot and story. Whatever the reason this film came out on top against Ironman, it had a good cast and plot and of course it wasn't laden with over the top graphics of CGI. This film has a good concept and does well with it through a good cast and almost blinding graphics. I liked this film, Edward Norton was great and even Liv Tyler was good enough to make the film feel that bit more real. This is not just a film for the Marvel fan, but an audience even bigger than just that.",8,2,5,14 June 2008
Lucky Number Slevin," A Mob Film With A Twist!
","Lucky Number Slevin' is a mob film without a doubt, but it does have twists left right and centre and of course the big one right at the end of it all! In my view this film represents human nature and of course how far we are willing to go for vengeance, the aftermath of it. Violent, compromising and brilliant performances from Josh Hartnett and Bruce Willis. Their performances keep you on your seat waiting for their next move or action and of course in your head you calculate the result of it.A brilliant film in many aspects, in my view overseen as a film that should have earned more praise and awards. Not much else I can say except it is a film worth splurging out for cash wise.",9,1,2,1 March 2008
3:10 to Yuma," An Enjoyable Modern Western Where Russell Crowe and Christian Bale Work Amazingly Together
","I personally am not much of a Western fan, however recently I have got into the more modern and recent Westerns with casts I know of from other modern films. Maybe these films are not Westerns but they are to me and to others. 3:10 To Yuma is obviously a remake of a classic Western film, but it follows the original's story. The story is simple Christian Bale must escort captured con Russell Crowe to the 3:10 train to Yuma to face justice for his crimes, and those of his gang. Bale is doing the job for $200, which he needs to secure his land from being taken from him by the tax man.Here in begins his journey with his son to take Crowe to the train station, both dealing with those of Crowe's gang and even Native American Indian attacks. The weapons and equipment of the Wild Western period look amazing, sound great and authentic. The action is searing, and times can really take you aback with gunfights erupting anywhere. Russell Crowe and Christian Bale work well together, alongside an impressive supporting cast with Ben Foster playing Crowe's gang second-in-command intent on freeing his boss from the law. However its not just attacks and ambushes Bale must deal with, he like Crowe hides his own inner-demons which are also another reason for him doing the job. To tackle demons from his own past. The film moves along well, and you never get tired or bored as you are always moving along. This is accomplished with the cast, and story. A solid Western is what I would call 3:10 To Yuma and a film to settle down with.",7,0,0,30 November 2010
Inglourious Basterds," An Entertaining Yarn of What Should Have Happened
","Well now we all know Tarantino, his good films, his brilliant ones, and then his not so on target ones but Inglorious Basterds is between good and brilliant. Gory, brutal, gritty, sense shredding, but what this film really does is say; this is how World War 2 and the Nazis SHOULD have ended at least in the eyes of Quentin Tarantino. Personally I think Tarantino got it just right, it should have been the way it all ended if only for history to be different.Now regarding the acting, top notch cast. Brad Pitt actually is good in this, not his handsome celebrity who does not look the part of a disgruntled Jewish-American soldier angry at the Germans and looking for revenge. He does this perfectly, and so you look forward to every time he graces the screen unlike some of his other works. The rest of the cast is brilliant especially Christoph Waltz who is just as captivating as Pitt in this film as the evil SS colonel who everyone is gunning for almost as much as Hitler himself, well there were those just as bad who helped him and either got away with it or just disappeared.All in all worth the fare price I paid, and I would pay it again to see it once more. Great cast, great action, great drama too. See it, you will not regret it.",8,2,8,24 August 2009
This Is the End," A Good Post-Apocalypse Tale That Cannot Be Taken Seriously, But Can Make You Laugh Hard
","This Is The End is what most would call a parody of celebrity life; in the film all the actors and actresses actually play their real identities; Seth Rogen is himself, as is James Franco and other comedic stars. This in itself adds a new dimension to Rogen's films in respect of him writing the script and directing it. Whilst the end-of-days happens around them, the comedic stars act like anyone would during a Post-Apocalypse film; turning on each other and deciding on matters related to surviving. This film however also mixes comedy into the dark material, it's clear there are a lot of pokes at religions, identities and even personal bias and prejudice. This mixed in with trying to find drinkable water, and edible food gives us some hilarious moments between the stars of the film. This Is The End was well worth the price of entry, and I would recommend it to fans of Rogen's earlier works for the sheer comedy in it. Well worth the price of admission and snacks.",8,11,21,4 July 2013
Hot Fuzz," Simon Pegg & Nick Frost At Their Best!
","Brilliant, what else can I say! Simon Pegg as a tough, good cop while Nick Frost as the bumbling, action film fantasist who thinks all police work is 'guns and car chases!' Since Shaun of The Dead, I thought Pegg and Frost could do nothing even close as to what they did in Shaun of The Dead, how wrong I was! I was laughing my head off from start to finish with Hot Fuzz, even the scene when Frost and Pegg walk home a drunk only for Frost to charge him Â£20 and for Pegg to give it back to him in 'change.' or when Frost asks Pegg what made him want to be a 'policeman.' You can't go wrong with Hot Fuzz, a quiet takeaway snuggled up to the couch can go a long way!",8,5,9,30 March 2007
Watchmen," A Strong Visual Adaptation of A Comic That Follows A New Trend of Superheroes
","Now personally I have never read the Watchmen comics, being I was to young too and that i've never really been a comic lover. However this film adaption of the comic seems to me a very well done one, and follows like a few Marvel adaptations and also 300. Watchmen incorporates a new trend of superheroes and that is the torn, damaged, and very human superhero. Someone more realistic, and obviously does not have superpowers but does wield training and equipment that allows them to be heroes to the world.Watchmen follows a different time line, and of course a parallel universe that sees the 1980's pan out a lot different to how they really did. Nixon is still in power, the stand-off between the USA and the Soviet Union is at a boiling point that is nuclear war on the horizon and obviously the end of the world. Afar from the plot of the film, I can greatly appreciate the amount of work, funding and scope given to this epic project. The cast was brilliant and worked well alongside each other on the screen, special effects were top notch and were not cheap looking in which would have made the film also feel cheap.Zack Snyder has done a great job of adapting quite a great but difficult to adapt comic into a film, maybe to some its not what Watchmen should be but its certainly at least close to the truth. At over three hours long, you have to have the threshold of patience to really enjoy this film and open your mind to a new world in the film. For some this is a hard task to do, and for others its just impossible and so it is for the patient group of film goers to enjoy. If you persist its a worthy reward, a dazzling world parallel to our own and also shows us the deep seated fear and paranoia of the Cold War period. How everyone feared their neighbour was a Communist or Soviet sympathiser. Its also to me, a new look at superheroes. Not those of the Marvel world who have powers and seem to always save the day, but everyday men and women who with training and equipment at their hands are able to at least try to stem crime and corruption. Watchmen is not for children obviously, and so its for a mature viewer with its content but also its scope. Watchmen makes a insightful film to watch, and also just one to let your mind open to on a Saturday night. Cast:9/10 Special Effects: 9/10",9,2,4,28 November 2010
The Killing Fields," A Solid Deep Story With A Great Cast and Sad Historical Value
","The Killing Fields is a surprising film, that could have matched any Vietnam set film as its set in Cambodia. Most know of the Vietnam War, but almost only half of the world still remembers what Cambodia went through during Pol Pot's heinous ethnic cleansing of the people with the help of his brutal regime the Khmer Rouge. They systematically murdered over 2 million Cambodians who were to them 'undesirables' and needed to be removed.The Killing Fields is a film that realistically portrays the genocide, and the infamous Killing Fields where most of the genocide victims ended up, and attempting to cross the watery fields their remains made a soup to crawl through. This film is extremely sad and hard hitting, as the Cambodian genocide never really got much coverage as say the Vietnam War did. The filming of the event in this film is very well done and captures the horrific moments of the genocide. People being herded onto trucks bound for executions, children being murdered in front of their parents.This film could in my opinion match even most big-budget Jewish Holocaust films with how gritty the feel of this film is. The film follows American photographer for a US newspaper who is stuck in the country following the Khmer Rouge's take-over played by Sam Waterston, however it is the second and most frank viewpoint of character Dith Pran portrayed by real life Khmer Rouge survivor Haing S. Ngor who was sadly murdered in 1996 due to his views of the Khmer Rogue. Haing S. Ngor is amazing surviving the Genocide, seeing many of his friends and countrymen hacked down by the Khmer Rogue. This film is for those who wish to see a tragic event just as sad as the Holocaust and indeed the Vietnam War. Its disturbing at times but must be to portray the events of the Genocide. This is a classic in its own name now, and its a film I can watch over and over again.",8,2,2,30 November 2010
28 Weeks Later," 2007's Best Film Hands Down!
","I saw this film in a free preview, but this was the movie I wanted to see the most this year! The fact I saw the one film I wanted to see this year the most for free is astonishing, I would have gladly paid the entry fee on 11th May, gladly! More than Spiderman 3 and Pirates of The Caribbean 3. I waited for the day I would see this preview, and it was worth it! 28 Weeks later redefines the likes of horror sequels, it succeeds where The Hills Have Eyes failed and where Halloween did also, this film isn't just for survival horror fans, but film goers all round. The end of the film is quite a shock, and it alone is worth the Â£7.50 entry fee.Robert Carlye shines on screen, even with the US Army being in a pivotal role, they also shine. 28 Weeks later I would recommend to any film goer, even fans of Spiderman or Pirates of The Caribbean, you'll understand why it was one of the biggest films of this year and why so many have waited for it's release!",10,10,40,9 May 2007
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," The Epic Finale That Harry Potter Yearned To Become, Now Follows The Epic Journey That Lord of The Rings Had
","Harry Potter personally has been an enjoyable series of films to date, however it lacked the epic scale and plot that up to the fifth film The Order of The Phoenix finally corrected. The fifth and sixth films of the series finally hit gold with the epic scale that brought back memories of The Lord of The Rings or the Star Wars prequel films. In part one of the final film, Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione face off against the dark lord himself in a race to turn back the tide he has brought with him consuming the land.In this finale, the scale of things has been lifted and no longer do we have a child like world that the first few films incorporated. From the start of this film, you know it has come a long way and matured into something more deeper and epic. No longer do our characters have a safety net to save them, at the final moment of the film and nor is there a quick fix present for them. Instead we have soul searching, character development and confessions being made that set the groundwork for part two.Harry, Hermione and Ron have matured and grown into the characters we waited for them to become. Battle hardened, scarred warriors that have their flaws, but also their strengths that they will need to use against their enemies. This is also a film that will hit fans of the franchise hard, with many characters falling at the hands of the dark lord and will surely be missed.The budget has also been raised for these two final instalments, and its obviously with the scale of locations, effects and plot-driven events. I feel that The Deathly Hallows has reached the epic level of Lord of The Rings, and even Star Wars. I think that the studio and director finally caught onto the success of The Half-Blood Prince with its dark theme and story, following on with the dark lord now taking over every foundation of the Wizarding world, our heroes are desperate, and at times turn on one another out of fear and desperation.You feel these characters have grown and can now survive on their own, as they have to and have no one there to help them. This is a great start to the finale, and I cannot wait for the final part and hope the dark theme and epic scale continue.",9,2,4,26 November 2010
Shrek Forever After," A Good Fun Fairytale For The Family, and An End To A Saga
","Well it was bound to happen, most animation saga's or trilogy's end eventually and some better than others. With Shrek Forever After this is the case, still packed full of gags, funny moments and hilarious one liners its a good end to a fun enjoyable franchise. We all hoped it would also end this way, in a positive way as the last 11 years has been Shrek sequels some better than others. With this final adventure, old characters are reunited and new ones enter the fray.Plus we also get a fresh new setting for this latest and final tale, some good dialogue too and of course improved animation. Considering this was always gonna go up against Toy Story 3, we knew it would be a close fight for the throne of the summer blockbuster. Otherwise, however Shrek Forever After has done a good job of grabbing it for me until I see Toy Story 3, until then I believe this is the best animation summer blockbuster of the year.If you want quick gags, laughs and family fun Shrek Forever After is for you and also for fans of the franchise.",7,27,36,9 July 2010
No Country for Old Men," Violence, Drama and Menace!
","The desert, violence and murder... oh and a hell of a lot of Heroin and cash! This would make any person's mouth water at even the idea, not to mention seeing it in person and a load of dead corpses around it. Now that would usually put off a person from the idea of taking the loot and scampering off, knowing in their minds that death seems to be a common factor in the situation. An ordinary man while out hunting stumbles across the find, and rather than report the deaths and the loot to the police he takes both the drugs and the cash and prepares to flee for a new life. That is until he comes face to face with evil in human form, a hit-man set on taking the same loot in question for himself.What follows is pure carnage and devastation that only the Coen brothers could imagine, this being evident in their past classics like Miller's Crossing and Fargo. For many the violence in the film would put them off from viewing it, but remember shock is one of the best tools to catch a person's attention. All in all No Country For Old Men is a classic in the making and of course has made Javier Bardem a household name as the high powered air-gun wielding assassin. I'd recommend this film to anyone who wants to see excellent acting and a great storyline that would put even LOST to shame.",8,3,5,1 March 2008
Twilight," A Unique Book Adaption
","OK so not a great film to some, but to others a good vampire love film. A good cast, and storyline and for those who are big fans of the books you will know it does stick to the original book closely. Robert Pattinson from Harry Potter 4 shows he can act and do a good American accent. Kristen Stewart is on top form in this film, she and Pattinson are on their way to the top of movies and cinema alike.Great action, and of course to me a superb soundtrack including Paramore and even Pattinson's own music which I must admit is great. I'm a guy so I did not expect much from a romantic teen movie, but I was immediately drawn to this and could not tear my eyes from the cinema screen when I went to see it. Do I recommend it to almost any movie goer, maybe not but at least give it a try for the fare of renting it from a video store or indeed on cable go for it, if you don't like it you don't lose much. I loved this movie and cannot find a flaw with it.",8,0,3,11 September 2009
28 Days Later...," Boyle's Best!
","First of all this is to all those who criticised 28 days later... HA HA HA! It was a success, and you lot got made to look like idiots! Now that is over, 28 days later is a British masterpiece and a piece of British film history. Forget Dawn of The Dead and even Land of The Dead, they were good enough films but they never gave you that tingling feeling of realism, when you watch 28 Days Later you shake and quiver in fear and anticipation, well I did anyway!The scene of empty London streets and the feeling of loneliness Cillian Murphy feels when he leaves the hospital, it's unique! Also you get that end of the world feeling that Night of The Living Dead failed (in my view) to give off. Anyway it is a brilliant film and for others like myself, there is a sequel called 28 Weeks Later and it's out in May 07.",10,0,1,30 March 2007
Hellboy," A Film That Was Overly Criticised!
","Now, let's get this straight. Just because Hellboy was an adaption of a D.C comic does not make it any less good, just because it ain't Marvel. This is a good enough representation of a comic series that in itself, is quite complicated to create. Were talking about a Devil like creature who is on the side of good, not bad. When you see Hellboy many of you automatically think... what a load of crap!Just because Spiderman does not look like an ogre means crap, just because Wolverine has a loving side does not mean Hellboy does not. Batman Begins was a success, and it itself was a D.C comic creation, the present-day hype over Marvel films like Spiderman and X-Men have overshadowed over great comics that can and should be made into films. Don't get me wrong they are good movies, it's just they have kinda beaten the competition out of the game simply through the press coverage on the films and the comics. Can Stan Lee really handle rivalry in the world of Action/Fantasy, if not he may have done a few things to make this film less than a success. Hellboy also has some great music overlooked by the more well known Marvel films and their own music.An overly criticised film that fell foul to the bigger and richer dogs of the film industry.",7,3,4,15 April 2007
The Mist," A Great Stephen King Film Yet Again
","OK, now I know many regard some of Stephen King's earlier work as his best, first and foremost. I regard the likes of Creephshow, IT, The Stand and even Rose Red as his most critical films and mini-series in my view. Mainly because of the ground work he put in place for them and the sheer scope of the films in regards to making characters strong and understandable. However he never forgets to put his famous horror into them and I think he has succeeded with The Mist.We have strong characters, the mystery surrounding the monsters and what is actually happening to the characters. We get a sense of the Stand here, with regards to their being a virus but in this it is a mist that covers the planet. Out of this mist comes creatures you would have only read about or heard of in books or just simply King's imagination. The ending to this film has been criticised but in my view it ends the film with a clear motive; true horror that scares you to the very depths of your morality.All in all a great film I can only stress as being one of King's best works.",9,1,3,4 November 2008
Stardust," A Great Fantasy Adventure Yarn Worthy of J.R.R Tolkien's Praise!
","OK let's get this straight, I am stingy about fantasy films as I used to watch them all the time, so I do have certain standards. Stardust delivers on these standards, and if you all want to do what critics say like Johnathan Ross go ahead because it is your loss! Remember they have been wrong before! Stardust is in league with the likes of Labyrinth and even Lord of The Rings, you must also take into account it was written by Neil Gaiman who also wrote the story for the film Mirrormask. If anyone has seen either of these films and enjoyed them, then Stardust is a perfect film to add to the fantasy genre. Great acting from Michelle Pheifer and Robert De Niro, and an even better performance from Claire Danes part which surprised me. Great visual effects, a story that keeps you on your toes at every turn. A film worthy of the genre, in a league with Harry Potter and even LOTR! Do not listen to film critics, they are always almost wrong! Take a chance and see a movie which I think will be a worthy rival to Harry Potter this year!",8,3,4,16 October 2007
The Departed," A Brilliant IRISH Gangster Film
","Brilliant film, not just because it's a Scorsese film but because of who the film portray! Irish gangsters haven't been brought to film as much as Italian ones have been, we've had Saving Grace and Gangs of New York but since the bad press of Gangs of New York the Irish have been seen as stupid and unable to run a REAL crimunal organisation, but the Departed shows that we can with Jack Nicholson as the gangboss.I'm full Scottish and part Irish, so it's great to see Celtic gangsters take the screen instead of the Italians. Jack Nicholson excels as Frank Costello, he portrays a violent but smart gangster perfectly. I must also say that DiCaprio is even good too, he unlike in Gangs of New York plays a role he can do. Matt Damon is great as bent cop on Costello's payroll. For fans of Irish gangster films, check out Saving Grace and the TV series Brotherhood.Oh and by the way... Boston is a mainly Irish city, they all emmigrated there in the early 1900's.",9,0,2,16 February 2007
Die Hard," One The Greatest Action Flicks of All Time!
","What can you say, Die Hard is responsible partly for most of the action films of the early 1990's and onwards. Yes there was ROBOCOP and TERMINATOR, and they too contributed to creating the ACTION fad! Where ever you look nowadays you can't find a decent action movie, I mean Smoking Aces was alright but Spiderman 3 was a let down.I remember seeing this film as far back as when I was only seven or eight, and it blew my mind. I later bought in on VHS, burnt through it with over watching it till eventually it was released on DVD and I bought it again. Die Hard didn't break any conventions of past action films, but rather re-invents the macho one-liners and the extreme action scenes. In my view, we have the likes of Transporter, Crank and even Man on Fire simply because of DIE HARD!Disagree with me, I don't care! It's my opinion, I seriously recommend Die Hard to any Action fan hands down!",8,2,3,11 May 2007
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," A Good Summer Blockbuster If Nothing Else
","OK now due to 2009's not great line up of cinema releases, including Terminator Salvation which I have yet to still see and X-Men Origins we haven't had much to look forward to. However with Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen we have a better robot film than Salvation, in comparison anyway. Good CGI, good acting from the cast including Megan Fox and of course the action keeps most entertained like myself. Maybe they need to rethink some concepts and elements for the next instalment, rather than re-chewing the old things from the first film and making a second film. All in all it was a good film at least to me and others who think the same, remember there aren't many great films out there so accept the good ones or at the very least the amusing ones.",8,2,6,24 August 2009
American Gangster," A True Gangster Epic
","Now i've heard some mixed reactions to this movie, and I must say I don't think that. American Gangster is a perfect gangster film. A rise and fall film, but it is done better than both Empire and Carlito's Way put together. Where Empire fails, American Gangster prevails where historical accuracy is needed as well as a good background story. It's violent and sometimes shocking, but being an avid gangster/crime fan i know that compared to others this is almost nothing.A brilliant biopic of New York gangster Frank Lucasm the film also utilises Lucas's relationship with the Italian Mafia perfectly, giving you almost a two way view of the city's underworld. Denzel Washington excels at the part as Lucas, and Russell Crowe as the cop out to get him is almost blinding. Crowe does a great American accent, as well as portraying a cop out to just do his job but can't properly. It's a a film about Lucas's rise to fame in New York's Heroin business, and his fall due to both Crowe and police persistence.Like with most gangster films, you are always put off by either the acting or the story. But here this is not the case, you have a true story that does not mask Lucas's violent life but rather portrays it as a life of both murder and violence. It does not glamorise his life in any way, it's a film that says criminals never get away with what they've done. Both Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe are perfect in the criminal and cop relationship.I would say now do not listen to the negative reviews of this film, they do no justice for the film. I'd recommend this film to fans of crime flicks and those who just want a riveting film to watch.",8,264,388,25 October 2007
1408," A Fun Enjoyable Psychological Thriller From King
","Its been sometime since one of King's works have made it to the big screen, since most of his works go straight to video or television with the likes of IT and The Stand. With 1408, King brings us a serious but enjoyable psychological horror that mixes well with a thriller too.Performance wise, John Cusack and Samuel L Jackson are on top form and for Jackson it proves he can go for the more deeper smaller screen films in the cinema. Cusack and Jackson work well together here, and show some good moments together.The eeriness of the film is evident a lot, and we are really messed with psychologically and so you feel like you are getting a good experience. The setting is creepy and you are given the King experience, some moments really grab you and shake you with shock while others entertain your basic nerves.Really this is a film for King fans, unless you are a horror fan in general you may be surprised, so give it a try.",7,0,1,14 July 2010
Jackie Brown," Less Guts, Over-The-Top Violence and Quirkyness But No Less Stunning
","Most Tarantino fans agree that Pulp Fiction is Tarantino's greatest work, due to its wackiness and over the top violence and humour. I won't disagree there, but Jackie Brown another of Tarantino's films is just as good personally. Yes it is lacking some things in Pulp Fiction, more in order to make space for a more entwining storyline and also to interlink characters more. Jackie Brown is about a 44 year old stewardess Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) who is caught by the ATF and law enforcement ferrying cash for a Los Angeles based gun dealer Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson) who is making a killing in profits selling all kinds of guns to very sour and dangerous people. She is given a choice; help the authorities nail Ordell or face hard serious jail-time and here begins her story. She chooses to nail Ordell for the cops, in exchange for no prison time and immunity. Beginning her sting, to let the cops catch Ordell with his hands on the money she begins to hatch her own plan of taking Ordell's $500,000 dollars for herself. Alike to Pulp Fiction we see the spanning storyline from different perspectives and viewpoints of those of Jackie, Ordell, and even the lower characters of the world including a Bail-Bondsman and a newly released con friend of Ordell's.Tarantino makes us in the end root for Jackie Brown to get her hands on Ordell's money, as we being to like her and understand her predicament due to Ordell's activities. We see him as a cowardly brutal businessman who in the end would rather shoot one of his people dead, than allow them to live and risk prison. Tarantino shoots Jackie Brown alike to how he shot Pulp Fiction, with very gritty environments and set-pieces, moving from one to another to piece in another character's story.The violence isn't regular, but when it comes along its just right to get across the scene like when Ordell shoots dead one of his own people when they risk a big prison sentence, or when Robert De Niro's character flips out shooting dead Ordell's annoying girlfriend. These scenes are quickly shot, and you are taken to another character's point of view.Maybe Jackie Brown to some hardcore die-hard Tarantino fans is not his best work but to some its one of his best, alongside Pulp Fiction. The cast is great, with searing performances from Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson and even Robert De Niro in supporting roles, however one that even surprised me was Robert Forster's performance as the bail bondsman who gets close to Jackie Brown and helps her swindle the $500,000 from under Ordell's nose. His performance was quite good, and at a point almost stole the show from Samuel L. Jackson. Jackie Brown is a great film in Tarantino's long run of works.",8,0,0,28 November 2010
V for Vendetta," A great Film About REBELLION & REVOLUTION!
","What can I say... Exceptional! V for Vendetta is simply about an outraged and angry man's struggle against a wrong society where the strong rule and weak are trampled on! Of course there have been films about rebellion and revolution, like The Postman and Waterworld, where an apocalyptic world of senseless violence by either a government or a force pushes a man over the edge.Hugo Weaving is brilliant as the Freedom Fighter, V and even Natalie Portman shines as a strong woman with a good enough English accent unlike many films where they are not. The story itself brings you to tears almost, men and women with diverse sexualities tortured and executed by a Totalitarian government along with Races and Faiths that differ from White/Christians.V stands up to this government and makes his message clear, enough is enough. I think they should make a new genre to accompany these sort of films, like Rebellion or Revolution films.",10,2,5,14 April 2007
