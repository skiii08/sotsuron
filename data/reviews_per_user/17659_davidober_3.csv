Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Sad...
","It's obvious that George Lucas has surrounded himself with 'Yes Men.' How else can you explain the ridiculousness that is PHANTOM MENACE? Juvenile and wooden, the film failed to hold the attention of my 11 year-old. My eight and six year-olds enjoyed the movie. Was George aiming that low? I seriously doubt it. ** out of *****",4,0,1,10 February 2000
X-Men," Pleasantly Surprised
","Not sure what made me pick up this film (though mostly positive comments from friends played some role). Was pleasantly surprised, and thought that Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart (Magneto and Xavier) together elevated the film to 'solid' territory, where lesser actors could have destroyed the film. Liked the way the film took its time getting to the action as, again, a lesser film would have had more -- and suffered for it. A solid 3.5/5 stars.",8,0,0,6 January 2001
Groundhog Day," Not just a good comedy, a *great* film
","I believe that Rushmore and Groundhog Day may be the two most underrated films of modern times. Both films are moving, funny, poignant and, oddly, feature Bill Murray. It is movies like these two -- that have filled me with such awe and pure joy -- that have moved me to write my own screenplay (something I'm doing for personal satisfaction -- I have little hope it will ever be made).",10,1,2,15 February 2000
