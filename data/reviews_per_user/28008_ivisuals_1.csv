Angels & Demons," Implausible from the start...
","Angels and Demons is a completely plot driven film. No chemistry between any of the characters. A bit of clever dialogue here and there. But when you're a plot driven film with a finite time, you better get that time right. When a finite amount of time is determined (as it is in this movie), you better make sure that it's believable that the characters can get from point a to point b in the amount of time. Angels and Demons rarely gets that time right. That Hanks character discovers pathways, entrances and exits throughout Rome and the Vatican that no one knows about is pretty ridiculous. Everyone living through the explosion of anti-matter is also completely ridiculous. And lastly, using the old premise of 'the butler did it' becomes really lame. Substitute orphan for butler and you have your criminal.",3,12,24,16 May 2009
