Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I loved the lightsaber duel, best fight scene I have ever seen.
","I can't wait for Episode 2.  A lot of people were disappointed by Episode 1, but not me.  I thought that the space battle could have been a little longer, but that didn't take away from the movie.  The lightsaber duel is the best part of the movie.  I can't wait to see what Ray Park will do in the next movie as the fight coordinator.",10,0,0,5 July 1999
