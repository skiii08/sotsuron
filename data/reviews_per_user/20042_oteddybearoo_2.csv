Deja Vu," dejavu. change the past?
","after watching the movie, man on fire, i got my eyes totally on denzel washington. i like a lot of tony scott's movie so i was very on to this movie. this movie gives you a headache at the end though.. it kept making me think how this scene could work. i don't still quite understand this movie, because claire is dead and doug carlin goes to her funeral but she is alive in the end. how would other people say about this,,,,? not only her but all the people on the ferry. i get the ambulance thing because it happened already and it didn't change but how could claire and the passengers on the ferry stay alive.? i don't understand that part but hey,its still a movie. and denzel washington was really great in this movie, i think it really suites for him. tony scott was very good. i was wish it was just a little more simple.......",10,0,1,14 May 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," the pirates of the Caribbean
","this movie is fantastic! oh my i love johnny depp and orlando bloom! johnny depp makes such a great pirate.i have seen this movie over 2 times now, even though it was released just a month ago. the movie was great, having the three;; johnny depp, orlando bloom,, kiera knightly together.. having another adventure but i don't like the ending,, i don't like it because it is not a clear ending.. i hope the 3rd one is better.. and i wondered why,..,, barbossa, the captain of the black pearl, no, the person who betrayed jack sparrow is alive.. i thought jack sparrow killed him in the first movie., i really hated the part when kiera knightly tied jack sparrow to the ship. of course i now that the person davy jones wants is jack sparrow, but still... he's a friend of her.. and she should have not done that!!!! AHH~I really love this movie, but before you watch it, watch the first one first, //. you don't really have to./. but it would be more enthusiastic and more understandable if you watch it..",10,0,1,5 August 2006
