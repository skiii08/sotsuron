Scarface," Good; Could have been great
","The problem with this film is that we never really know Tony Montana. He really has no roots; all we know is that he spent time fighting commies in Cuba. We see him grow into a multi-millionaire really from nothing. As a result, Montana seems like a run of the mill character who is really just a product of his society around him.Howeever, Pacino plays the role with such skill and energy that we cannot help but feel more for the actor than the character of Montana himself. I have to admit that the scene in the restaraunt after Tony is one of the fineset acting performances in film. If there was more footage shot in Cuba concerning his life growing up, it would have made for an even finer movie.The ending is classic.",Null,0,0,8 September 2001
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Absolutely Atrocious, Disgusting, Worse than High Fidelity, Yuck,
","If you think that singing a lovely song while slitting someone's throat is the stuff of a great musical, this pile of crap is for you.The songs have no 'pop,' the actors run through the pieces as if their asses were lit on fire.The other people in the theater clapped at this abomination to humanity. I publicly chastised them for doing so.Tim Burton and all those associated with this foul endeavor need medication, preferably Prozac. After seeing this waste, I might visit my doctor to see if he could prescribe me some. Perhaps I'll see Tim Burton there. That would make this regrettable experience worthwhile.",1,10,33,28 December 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Very Good Adventure Movie With Christian Overtones.
","This movie was very good due to strong acting and sharp direction. Howver, it is not great because the characters are so alien that I for one cannot relate to them. They are archetypes rather than characters.
However, for being an epic fantasy, it is excellent.",8,0,0,29 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Huh? WAIT a second....
","I know t hat there are some die hard Tolkien fans out there, but this movie needs to be around for about 10 years before it comes close to supplanting any of the Godfather films as one of the great films.It does an excellent job in giving the audience a crash course in the overall storyline, but its real selling point is the animation.
Interesting story, frustrating ending.",8,0,0,30 December 2001
Reservoir Dogs," Very Overrated...
","I've watched this movie twice, the second time to make sure I didn't miss anything. I didn't.The stunted, pointless dialog in the beginning of the movie made it pretentious. Tarantino refined his trademark of making ordinary, everyday speech extraordinary in Pulp Fiction. In Resevoir Dogs, it remained ordinary; painfully so.The only real trick in this movie is how Steve Buschemi didn't die from loss of blood. This was simply rediculous. He seemed to try too hard with this one. PF was simply a better movie..",4,2,6,15 September 2002
Pulp Fiction," Brilliant; Full of Symbolism
","It's been a while since I've seen this film, but I marvel at its complexity, both in its form and its meaning.When Jules utters 'lets get into character' at the beginning of the film(near the end, depending on how you look at it), Tarentino is forcing us to examine what is fictitious and what is real. His conversion at the end of the movie I think is the triumph of character and virtue over shallowness. He quits killing and decides to 'wander the earth' as so many people of conviction have done(the Disciples of Christ as well as many other historical/religious figures. Moreover, this film is about protecting the dignity of people. While most of the characters are despicable, somehow they manage to save someone else in the film. Examples: When the junkie save Marcellus' wife Mia; Butch saving Marcellus from further harm.In the end, Pulp fiction forces you to discern the difference between fact and fiction.",9,1,2,29 August 2000
Sin City," Despite Miller/Rodriguez/Taratino anti-Religious Paranoia, pretty good
","I awaited this movie for months, and despite the fact that the directors paint religious people with a broad, negative brush, it more or less delivers.I liked the creativity of the occasional color splashed against the back and white, tweaking the traditional motif of most film noir movies being completely aesthetically black and white. Sin City revives a genre that is dying on the vine.I also think that the dialog is some of the best of its kind. It's descriptive yet staccato enough to stay cool, which is the ultimate demand of a film noir film.The violence is not for everyone. It in fact is over the top, primarily in the Tarantino directed sequences (you'll know when).Religious people do not commit acts of such brutality that are perpetrated in this film. If the character who killed so many people were gay or of some other social minority, many people would take to the streets in protest.I will overlook the fact that a groups was painted with such a broad brush in favor of me being a comic book fan who has waited a long time to see this movie. Recommended with great reservation.",Null,1,5,2 April 2005
High Fidelity," I hate this movie; I hate hate hate this movie.
","I should tell the readers of this review that I only saw half of this film, because my friends and I walked out of it. I'm glad I did not spend $8.50 to watch this loser fest.The movie starts with John Cusack listing the top five lost girlfriends in his life. I should have known what I was getting into at this point.Rob (John Cusack) proceeds through the moviegoing to work at a record store he owns. He doesn't have the balls to fire the people he hired. Jack Black is excessively rude; he criticizes everyone and everything. He plays the role well, but the character is so obnoxious, I felt like I wanted to bitch slap him in every scene.Dick is a decent character, although he is a weenie. He attempts to counteract the over obnoxiousness of Jack Black's character. At least in the parts I saw saw him in, he seemed like  baggage rather than character with something to contribute.John Cusack plays a perfect generation x recrod store owner. He can never get anything right. Although Cusack plays the character well, he like the rest of the cast are a collection of annoyances rather than people with whom we can identify.I cannot understand why this movie is so highly regarded.",1,17,44,5 August 2000
