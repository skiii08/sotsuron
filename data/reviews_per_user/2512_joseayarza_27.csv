50 First Dates," Good but could've been better. The ending...
","The trailer for the movie made me think it would be a very romantic movie, since the guy has to win her love back everyday, you know, something that many couples don't use to do. Anyways, this is basically a comedy, and succeeds as that most of the time, but it's not ambitious enough to make us think a little. It entertains, but nothing more. Another complaint is the ending. Too forced and implausible, plus it kind of contradicted some things that had been said during the movie (can she remember her dreams????), and it just left us with many questions. It seemed that they just wanted to end the movie right away, and solved things the way they could. I give it a 6.5/10. Sorry because the premise was excellent, but the execution needed to be better.",Null,0,0,7 April 2004
Memento," I simply did not understand this movie
","OK, so the movie ended and I began to try to put the pieces together and solve the puzzle... but no, I just couldn't. Who where those people, how did Leonard meet them, how are they involved in the murder? I didn't understand that. Perhaps I would need to watch it again, but I don't know if I could bear it.",6,2,3,12 July 2002
Dead Poets Society," Very cheesy
","This is the WORST movie I've ever seen.Forget Waterworld, Wild Wild West or Battlefield Earth, this movie has everything I hate in a movie. First of all, Robin Williams making drama. God save us!! Always very sappy (I only liked him in Good Will Hunting). Cheesy dialogue. Sappy scenes (some scenes were so sappy I had to look away). Bad acting. Bad plot? Well, I don't even think this thing (I don't even call it a movie) has a plot. Ooohh and of course, it's BORING. I think that's the best adjective that describes this thing. BORING, BORING, BORING, BORING. Did I mention it was BORING?",1,16,66,26 April 2002
Ocean's Twelve," One of the worst ever
","This movie made me get dizzy. Characters talked so fast, things happened so fast. Being Mexican, I had to read the Spanish subtitles at a record speed, while I also tried to see what was going on, with all the camera angles and stuff. The movie was long, boring, full of nonsensical plot twists. It's like the filmmakers were trying to tell us: 'Oh, look, look, how clever we are'. I've never like movies that rely too much in plot twists. I eventually don't care about what happens anymore. Plot twists are good when they make sense, they are not predictable and when there's not many of them. Well, I didn't think the twists were predictable, but nonsensical and too many they were. With so many things going on, the great cast doesn't really have a chance to really shine. The cameos... well, I did like Bruce Willis' cameo, but the other one... it was completely unnecessary. It's a real shame because I really LOVED Ocean's Eleven, not a masterpiece, but a greatly entertaining movie. In this sequel, the cast isn't really going for the golden egg or the safe box... They are going for the audience's money.",1,1,2,18 January 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Episode One was MUCH better.
","Oh, Star Wars is not back. The magic of the original trilogy is just gone. Those characters you really cared about, those inventive action sequences, will never be back, it seems. Episode One was silly and had wooden characters and bad acting, but at least it was entertaining. Episode Two is silly, has wooden characters and bad acting, and IT'S BORING. The last 20 minutes or so are impressive, yes, but they don't save the entire film. When this movie isn't focused on the dull love story, it shows the uninteresting adventures of Obi-Wan or tortures us with political mumbo-jumbo. All the 'plot' is trivial: Someone tries to kill Padme, and who has to take care of her? Of course, Anakin. Yawn. Obi-Wan discovers that someone ordered a clone army so that the Republic could have a defense. Zzzzzzz. He discovers the mean plans of the separatists. More Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Yoda  many times appears and the order of the words in sentences he changes, as usual. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Padme and Anakin start to fall in love. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzIt is simply appalling. I'll give it a 4/10 just because the special effects were awesome. Previous ratings: Original trilogy (the three films):10/10. Episode One: 6.5/10",3,1,2,2 August 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," Nope
","This movie is funny, no doubt about it, but it doesn´t deserve to be in the top 250. It´s pretty much... forgettable. Mediocre. Nothing compared to Shrek, Toy Story, or Toy Story 2. The plot is extremely silly. In general, I do recommend it, but I warn you, this movie ain't that good. 7/10",3,3,16,4 March 2002
Bridget Jones's Diary," Horrible
","This movie is extremely overrated. It's not funny at all and Bridget Jones was so annoying!!!!! She really got into my nerves. I wanted to enter into the movie and kick her ass. Anyways, this movie was a cliche from beginning to end and I hated it. I use to love romantic comedies but it seems that the genre is going downhill. This isn't as bad as 'someone like you' but close enough. 4/10.",5,2,3,26 June 2002
Armageddon," A miserable experience
","God, this movie was horrible. I was only 14 when I watched it and I used to like any action movie, even if it was only brainless action, I really didn't care. So I went to the movie theater with my family to watch 'Armageddon' expecting another 'Deep Impact', but a faster one.The problems with the movie start right from the beginning. A little note to the writers: People who shoot other people on a leg (or anywhere) use to go to jail, you know? Right from the start you can see you're about to watch something incredibly stupid, like the NASA people sending ordinary drillers to space. Ha ha ha!But I really did not care for that, I was just expecting the action. Wgen the action finally came, I really felt like walking out. The movie is so fast and the scenes are so short that most of the time I didn't know what the hell was happening. Besides, those characters were not likable. Bruce Willis was a psychotic person who shoots his daughter's boyfriend at the beginning, do you think you'll like the character? Of course not. Plus, I hate Ben Affleck, I've always hated him, so basically, I was rooting for the asteroid (I'm not kidding, I really was).I can't imagine anyone enjoying this horrible movie -- not even as mindless action does it work.",Null,0,2,9 July 2002
American Beauty," the academy awards are just plain wrong...
","This movie is sooo boring. It´s completely pointless. Plot? Completely unexistent! Acting? Awful!! I just can´t believe anyone can actually like this movie. Why is it that odd movies are so overrated? Being John Malkovich was another piece of trash and everyone liked it!! Originality is good, but a movie can´t be good just because it´s original. A movie must have a good plot. It must be entertaining!!! This movie lacks of this qualities. I can't believe it won the Oscar to Best Movie. Well, actually, it´s not a big surprise, since the Oscars ceremony is really a popularity contest...",3,1,3,23 February 2002
American History X," Very good film
","I didn't want to watch this movie. I thought it would be a violent, gory, plotless film. Well, I was so wrong!! This is a great movie!! It even gives you a very good moral lesson!!I was really, really surprised. The only bad point is it's extremely rushed ending. It was unpredictable, but I didn't understand it!! SPOILERS ALERT. Who were those guys that shot Danny at the end?? I don't remember seeing them at any point of the movie. It left me confused. SPOILERS END. But anyways this movie is excellent. 9/10, it would have been 10 if the ending had been better.",9,0,0,13 March 2002
Ocean's Eleven," I expected more
","SPOILERS AHEAD. This movie is good and enjoyable, but it certanily could have been better. During the whole movie, the characters said that the robbery would be almost impossible, but when they were actually robbing the casino, I didn´t really think it was that difficult after all. The problems that they had during the execution of their plans were easily solved. I felt like they had everything controlled. At the end, all of the characters survived and only one ended in prison... but was released 3 or 4 months ago. If you're expecting a movie that will have you at the edge of the seat, you're wrong...",7,0,1,3 February 2002
Pearl Harbor," AWFUL!!!!!
","This movie is TERRIBLE!! I didn't like a second of it. That love story was so ridiculous. The only moment I liked was when Ben Affleck 'died', and I hated so much the moment when we found out he was alive. It was extremely long. Extremely boring. The war scenes were realistic, but they can´t save this movie. It is similar to Titanic, as many people have said, but I liked Titanic, I loved it, I feel that the love story did fit the tragedy, but in this movie, the love story is kind of forced.",1,1,2,24 January 2002
Pearl Harbor," She was fast....
","I already commented on this movie, expressing how awful it is. I just want to mark a mistake that nobody seems to notice. Evelyn starts feeling dizzy because of her pregnancy... like 3 days after making love with Danny!!! What was the writer thinking???",1,0,1,22 March 2002
Good Will Hunting," Great movie
","An instant classic. The plot is outstanding. The script is also very good, though sappy at times. The acting is wonderful. Matt Damon is very talented. And I think this is one of Robin Williams' best performance ever! The only problem: Ben Affleck. He is a good writer, but he's a TERRIBLE actor. Luckily, his character is not very important even though it has a lot of screen time. One of my top 20 movies. 9/10",Null,0,2,6 March 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Very disappointed
","After having loved the first movie, I just couldn't wait to see what was going to happen with those characters that 'Fellowship' made me care so much about. And what do I get? A dull plot, unnecessary scenes, excess of characters, lame battles, talking trees... God, I could stay here all night complaining about EVERYTHING that was wrong with this movie. Not even the final battle scene could hold my interest; in fact, it was during that scene that I was endlessly checking my watch, wondering how close was the ending. If I hadn't gone with a friend (who by the way did like the film) I think I might have walked out on this one. I've walked out on a movie in a theater only once (although plenty of times I've pressed 'stop' in a VCR) when I saw 'How the grinch stole christmas', and this was just about to be the second one. Yes, it was THAT bad.",5,0,0,21 December 2002
Moulin Rouge!," I really hated the film
","Wow. Another one in my list of movies that inexplicably are on top 250. It's simply horrible!! Visually this film is beautiful (it must have costed hundreds of millions) but this movie is very flawed in almost every other aspect. It is VERY overacted. The characters were silly, some of them... actually grotesque. The story is cliched and completely predictable. I didn't watch it until the end, but since the beginning you'll already know the ending, trust me. So overall, this movie was boring and really ridiculous. This movie is bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. Did I mention it was BAD?",1,2,6,14 April 2002
Black Hawk Down," I will never watch a Josh Hartnett movie again!
","SPOILERS AHEAD. If you go see this movie, I hope you like shooting and explosions... because that´s all this movie has!! No plot, no acting... Every couple of minutes, a character got injured or killed, and most of the time I didn´t even know what character was being shot!! The worst thing about this movie is that the only interesting plot is cut. I'm talking about the kidnap of Mike Durcant (or something like that). How is that solved?? With a little sign at the end informing us he was later released!!! That was so stupid I laughed out loud. Really awful movie. 2/10.",2,5,11,4 March 2002
There's Something About Mary," There's nothing about Mary
","It's strange. I usually like movies with bathroom and sex humor, like Dumb and Dumber, Me, Myself and Irene, Scary Movie, Not Another Teen Movie or Road Trip. But on those ocasions on which I happen to watch this movie on TV, I usually change the channel some 30 or 40 minutes into it. Perhaps it's just that the characters are too annoying, and the story too contrived, but the fact is, I think this could be one of the worst movies of all time. I'm not kidding. I've tried to watch it entirely because everyone says it's so good, but I never make it. I think I'll never understand  the overwhelming success of this film.",Null,0,0,26 August 2002
Life Is Beautiful," The structure of this film is very very strange...
","Overall, I liked the film. But the first half of the movie was completely a comedy (very funny) and the next was complete drama (with some comedy, but of course it's not the same). It was a little bit surprising for me. I mean, the first part was making me feel so happy, and the second part simply depressed me. This movie should have been divided into two films.",Null,0,1,13 April 2002
Pulp Fiction," Overall a great film, but...
","OK, I loved this film. LOVED IT. But it's not perfect. The main problem with the movie is that the best scene is at the beginning: the histerical what? conversation. This scene comes very early in the movie, so you would expect that the rest should equal or top that perfect scene. And while the movie is always interesting and has some other moments of great humor, it never reaches the greatness of that scene. Compared to that incredible scene, the rest of the film is a disappointment. That wouldn't be a problem if the scene had been left to the end, but since it's at the beginning....Putting that aside, this movie is so original. The characters speak a lot. In many movies, the characters only speak the necessary to advance the plot, and the action is given more importance. However, in Pulp Fiction, characters are given the chance to talk, as we talk in everyday life. As a result, the characters seem incredibly real and we care a lot about them. The non-linear structure is another plus. It's a very intelligent way to grab the audience and not letting go. At times the movie gets a little boring but you never lose interest because you always want to know whether the movie will move forward or backwards. Movies that play with time always work. Well, most of the time, at least.What about the acting? My personal favorite was Samuel L. Jackson. But everybody did a good job including Quentin Tarantino as the guy who helps the guys hide the body but is afraid that his wife might arrive and discover the whole deal. Uma Thurman was also great at portraying that strange woman who apparently likes to play with people's feelings, knowing that they're afraid of her, because of her husband. John Travolta  was my least favorite. He was too inexpressive for me, although, perhaps he did that intentionally because the character required it.Overall: 9/10.",10,5,11,27 July 2002
Titanic," One of the best movies I've ever seen
","This movie is perfect. The love story was believable, the acting was great, special effects were wonderful... This movie couldn't be better!! This is only movie I've bought. I like to watch it again and again. Truly a masterpiece.",10,2,3,11 March 2002
A Beautiful Mind," A beautiful movie
","This movie is one of the best I've seen. I didn't watch to watch it because it won the Oscar for Best Picture, and that isn't very good!! I hated Shakespeare in Love and American Beauty, and thought Gladiator was simply OK. Besides, Russell Crowe was, for me, a mediocre actor. But in this movie, he proves himself a great actor!! in fact, he makes this film a real pleasure to watch. His character is so well developed you can't help but love him. The other actors are also great. My favorite scene was when John receives the Nobel Prize and dedicates him for his wife. That scene DIDN´T REALLY HAPPEN. John Nash was divorced and remarried by that time. But I didn't know that when I saw the film, so I loved that scene. I'm glad they gave this movie a happy ending. I mean, it was charming. I wouldn't have enjoyed this film that much if the couple had divorced after everything Alicia had to go through. So in my opinion, changing the facts a little bit was a good decision.I'm glad it won Best Picture. Lord of the Rings was great but not as good as this one. Moulin Rouge! sucked. The Academy´s decision was the best.",Null,0,1,27 April 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Ecologists might like this film (spoilers)
","Yes, this movie is all recycled. I mean, the movie starts once again with Harry Potter suffering with his excentric uncle and aunt, then goes to Hogwartz (or however it's spelled) where there are strange things happening, so our 3 heroes break as much school rules as they can to investigate. Both of the plots involve something very secret, and end (SPOILERS) with a climatic battle against Voldemort. Now, this is not to say that the film is not entertaining. It is, but if the third movie turns out to be the same, I won't be thrilled, trust me. I haven't read the books, and I probably won't, but I hope the third installment is more original. MUCH more original.",Null,0,0,1 December 2002
Shrek," Great, great movie!
","Hilarious! I just couldn´t stop laughing during the whole film. The donkey was great!! He was the real star of the movie. The moral lesson of this film was very good. The plot was certainly predictable, but good. The parodies were fantastic. The character development was great. I didn´t expect this movie to be so good! I just hope its sequel is as good as this one, or even better (although making a movie better than this one is difficult).",10,1,2,23 February 2002
The Matrix," It's horrible
",I simply did not enjoy this film. The plot was so ridiculous that I left the theater with a bad taste. The action sequences well done but this movie was too long and unbelievable and I just got tired. The acting is horrible. I can't believe this thing is on top 250.,3,6,14,20 April 2002
The Thin Red Line," Unbearable
",This movie is so boring  that I give it the category of: unwatchable. No matter if it's good or bad. It has some good points. But it's extremly boring!! It's one of those movies in which you feel you're being tortured. I can't really understand how did I manage to sit through the whole film. It didn't deserve an Oscar nomination.,Null,1,3,6 March 2002
The Godfather," List of things which are more entertaining than watching 'The Godfather'
","1.- Pouring alcohol into an injury. 2.- Counting the number of books available in a big library. 3.- Reading all those books. 4.- Watching the Weather Channel for 5 hours. 5.- Looking for a needle in a haystack. 6.- Counting the hays in the haystack. 7.- Sharpening 10,000 pencils in a row. 8.- Seeing a tortoise walk a distance of about let´s say, a million miles.You get the idea, don´t you? This movie was so sloooooooooow, and the story just draaaaaaaaaaaags on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. It was a torture, and at the end, I wondered: WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THIS MESS OF A MOVIE? It seemed like it was also going to tell us the story of Michael's sons, grandsons, great grandsons,  great great grandsons, and well.... it just seemed endless. ENDLESS. I wondered why IMDb users praise it so much if every single person that I know despises this movie. It's beyond dull. At the end, somehow Michael got rid of ALL of his enemies, in 2 minutes? Just that simple? He should have made that before, and he would have kept me from suffering this dreck. After watching this, I never want to watch one of those called 'classics' (like Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Schindler´s list, Gone with the Wind, etc.) because it seems to ba a rule that a movie can´t be artistic and entertaining. Few movies combine those things. Those are the true classics. One example? Pulp Fiction. That movie is perfect in every possible way.I'll rate this movie a 3. I don't give it a one just because Marlon Brando was great. By the way, Al Pacino sucked in this movie. He couldn't have been more inexpressive.",3,18,43,22 June 2002
