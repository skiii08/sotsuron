Changeling," A strong emotional drama
","Clint Eastwood is probably one of the most versatile and respected filmmakers today. He started off his career as an actor in the 1950's and became a director in the 1970's, and moved on with both careers, until his retirement as an actor in 2008 with 'Gran Torino', but his directing career is moving on at a fast-paced rhythm. And the also 2008's 'Changeling' proves thar he, at almost 70 years old, still got it.'Changeling' is set in the Los Angeles of the late-20's. It tells the story of Christine Collins, a hard-working woman that finds out her son, Walter Collins, was missing in one afternoon. After searching for him during months, the police gives back Walter to her, but she doesn't fells that's her son. This is an actual story that really took place in that period, therefore the screenplay is accurately based on what really happened. The script is extremely well-written, taking the actual events and transforming then a little bit for dramatic purposes, based on actual statements, newspapers, etc. Even though this is a very powerful story and it was well-told, the script can be a little annoying at some parts, with the too-often repetition of Christine saying 'my son'.The acting here is nice. Most of the supporting cast delivers a nice job, the movie was well-cast, John Malkovich is great as the Reverend that helps Christine and no one else other than him stands out. The problem with the acting I have here are the child actors. Of course you can't expect much of children, but most of them don't act their ways out. The only child actor that delivers a good performance is Gattlin Griffith, as Christine Collin's son. The main part here went to Angelina Jolie. I've never saw a movie with her other than the 'Tomb Raider' series, so it's nice to see that she can act. She gives a strong performance as Christine Collins, and it was even Oscar-nominated for it. I really can't think of any other actress to portray the lead role so well as Jolie did.As always, Clint Eastwood directs this movie brilliantly. His talent as a director is absolutely undeniable, and he proves it once again. I think any script would work on Eastwood's hands. As of the other aspects, the soundtrack here is so-so, it serves for dramatic purposes but it isn't memorial at all. The cinematography is well-made, with some beautiful shots, but the art-direction and set-decoration transform this movie into a great representation of the 1920's.Overral, this is a very strong emotional drama. The true story is very interesting and used in a very nice way by the script. The cast is all nice, with a exception for the children actors. Jolie delivers an excellent performance in the leading role. As always, Clint Eastwood makes a very competent job directing. The soundtrack and cinematography are both nice, and the movie is a nice representation of the 1920's Los Angeles.8/10",8,2,5,13 February 2010
Milk," Just like any other biography...
","Harvey Milk is quite an important name in America's history, but an even more important name in the history of homosexuality. He was the first assumed gay to ever get a political job in the United States. And he did it in the conservative and controversial California of the 1970's. Harvey Milk is also well-known for his death in 1978, when he was shot by a political rival. With a life-story like this, it's impressive that took almost thirty years until Milk's story became a movie. But Gus Van Sant finally did it in 2008, with Sean Penn in the leading role. And the movie came out nice, but the problem is - it feels just like any other biography...'Milk', obviously tells the story of Harvey Milk (Sean Penn). But the movie only covers eight years of Milk's story, going from his first encounter with his later-to-be 'husband' Scott Smith (James Franco) until his death in 1978, just when he was growing in the political career. Dustin Lance Black is the one who created the movie's screenplay (and even got an Oscar for it). He did a good job, but could have done a better one. I really liked the way the movie was told- with Milk narrating his own life-story in a videotape only meant to be opened in the event of his death. As Milk narrates, we get to see important moments of his life, both personal and professional. The more impressive is that this not a plot device - Milk actually recorded such a tape in late-1977. At first, I really liked the fact that the movie portrays only Milk's life from 1970 to 1978 - but then I was completely disappointed by it. Everything happens too fast in the first years of this period, and in the second half the movie only covers 1978. This left somethings weird, because there are lots of situations that could have been better developed. And even in this second half, I think the movie could better explain Dan White's (Josh Brolin) motivation to kill Milk. The movie also leads you to believe in things that didn't happened in real life - but this a problem with basically every other movie in the Biography genre.One thing that I really enjoyed in 'Milk' was the casting. The movie is quite well-casted, and everyone seemed just like their life counterparts. This was achieved with an excellent makeup effect- at first, I couldn't really recognize who was who. But this effort in trying to cast look-alike's from the people in Milk's life compromised the acting itself. Almost the whole supporting cast did an average, if not bad, job. Little stars like Alison Pill, Diego Luna, James Franco or Lucas Gabreel couldn't hold their candles in Sean Penn's side. The only two members of the supporting cast that actually did a good job were the always-good Josh Brolin (in his first Oscar-nomination), and Emile Hirsch, that impressed me another time, after his good job in 'Into the Wild'. Better keep an eye in this kid. Of course, the whole attention here goes to Sean Penn, in the leading role of Harvey Milk. He impressed everyone with it, and got his second Oscar for this movie (only the ninth actor to achieve this accomplishment). Nothing more to say, except for: 'Well done, Mr. Penn'.Gus van Sant also did an average job directing this picture. It's not his best work thus far- but it's not his worst either. He conducts Milk's story in his own way, and a couple of scenes bothered me a lot. It's undeniable that the man has style, I just don't appreciate it. If he made different choices in a few scenes, it would be much better. The scene of Milk's death- with the execution-like feel and the slow-motion was the scene that bothered more about the movie- along with the choice to do not show Dan White killing the mayor. Of course it's not all bad- the beginning in black and white and the speech's' scenes show all Gus Van Sant's talent. The editing here is also average, along with the cinematography and the Musical Score.Overral, 'Milk' is a nice movie. Even though it feels just like any other biography, with very similarities in the movie of the genre, it has its own style. Gus Van Sant's directing did this, along with Dustin Lance Black's Original Screenplay. The acting, except for Sean Penn's marvelous job and Josh Brolin's nice work was quite average also. It's a nice movie, but could have been better- with better choices in both the direction and the writing.A 6,5, that rounds up to a 7 only because of Penn.7/10",7,2,4,16 March 2010
Footloose," At least it's better than 'Flashdance'
","Back in 1984, when 'Footloose' came out, dance movies were very popular. After the success of 1970's productions, like 'Saturday Night Fever', everyone was trying to get some in the 1980's. That's where the problem began. Every dance movie that came out, you already knew what was going to happen, what is it about, etc. And with 'Footloose', is no different.This movie tells the story of Ren McCormack (Kevin Bacon), a boy from Chicago that moves to a small town. There, while falling in love with the Reverend's daughter (Lori Singer), he finds out that there is a law against dancing in this town(!), now he tries to organize a dancing ball for his class and fights against his law. From this, you already know what's going to happen, and it's really boring. The plot is really absurd, if it was set in the 1950's, it would be believable. At least the movie has a few sub-plots, but none of them is interesting or gets your attention, they are all cliché and predictable. By in the middle of it, I kept thinking 'If this a dance movie, why a plot? What about the dancing?'. And that's where lies the problem of the movie. A dance movie with no dancing! The soundtrack is excellent with great original songs like 'Footloose' and 'Let's hear it from the boy', but you don't get to see anyone dancing in the most of the movie. Instead, what you get are bad-made dialogs and a non-believable story.The acting here is ridiculous. Kevin Bacon looks more like a gay alien and nothing else, and Lori Singer isn't beautiful at all. Thankfully, the movie has John Lithgow and Dianne Wiest, and they really saved the movie. They are both excellent as the Reverend and his wife. The other aspects aren't even worth mentioning, but Herbert Ross' directing really bothered me with close-ups of people's feet.Overral, this is a really bad dance movie. The direction bothers you, and the two leads don't act their ways out. But the nice soundtrack and original songs, as well as John Lithgow and Dianne Wiest made the movie watchable. It's better then 'Flashdance', what doesn't say much, but it's nothing compared to better dance movies, like 'Saturday Night Fever'3/10",3,4,12,28 January 2010
The Thing," Easily Carpenter's best
","'The Thing' came out in 1982. Back then, John Carpenter was already a quite famous director, with hits like 'Assault on Precinct 13' or 'Halloween'. And with the success of 1981's 'Escape from New York, Universal Studios gave Carpenter a free pass to adapt John W. Campbell Jr.'s short story 'Who Goes There?'. The problem is that 'The Thing' came out only two weeks after Steven Spielberg's 'E.T.: The Extra- Terrestrial'. Therefore, 'The Thing' was a massive fail with the public, and also didn't go well with the critics, saying it was too gore and violent. Now, 28 years have passed, and 'The Thing' acquired a cult status, having the recognition it always deserved - as the best John Carpenter movie. 'The Thing' follows a group of American researchers in Antarctica that are confronted by a blood-thirsty alien creature that assumes the identity of whoever it kills. Now, they don't know who to thrust, and if the other researchers are human or alien. The movie's screenplay is based on a short story by John W. Campbell. Written in 1951, and adapted firstly for the big screen in the same year, this story clearly represents the fear of communists taking over America. But Carpenter's movie came out in 1982, so the Cold War fear is long gone, and he adapts the story in a much more present way. The paranoia subject here is also treated very nicely. The feeling of getting stuck with an alien and to don't know in who to trust builds up along the movie perfectly. There are a few things still unexplained about the movie's story, which proves how well-written this is and also explains why there are so many fans of this. The writing here also allowed John Carpenter to create some of the most scary sequences ever.The cast here is not very big and is composed only by males, and is headed by Kurt Russell, back then a rising star that also had the leading role in Carpenter's previous movie, 'Escape from New York'. He does his job pretty well, as so did all the other actors. Of course this isn't the kind of movie that depends on the acting in order to work - it's all about the writing and the directing. Aside from Russell, that aren't many famous actors, maybe with the exception of Keith David. A name that is worth mentioning is Wilford Brimley. He was certainly the best member of the cast.John Carpenter's directing work is, as always, incredible. He has a very strong style, that is present in every single frame of this movie. He manages to create completely scary sequences out of the nowhere, and it's his directing that keeps the movie going. The movie, like every Carpenter one, has that claustrophobic feel to it, and the way Carpenter handles the characters is simply amazing. The opening sequence - with the helicopter chasing the dog, is one of the best opening sequences in the horror movie industry - it settled the mood perfectly, and showed this was no ordinary horror film.The mood in here is also built by all the other aspects of the movie. The creature design is one of the best in movie's history, and the animations are perfect. As there was no CGI, the movie utilizes makeup to create the illusion of the creatures, and is considered until today a landmark on makeup special effects. It couldn't be better. Ennio Morricone's original music score also did it pretty well, with the use of bass chords pretty common on Carpenter's previous films. The cinematography is also excellent, with a dark and scary mood.Overral, 'The Thing' is easily John Carpenter's best movie. The reception of the movie when it first came out wasn't really fair to what this movie is. But now, 28 years after the release, people finally realized how good this movie is, acquiring a well-deserved cult status. The excellent writing, along with the good acting and Carpenter's perfect directing make this one of the best and most scary horror movies ever made. 10/10",10,13,18,4 March 2010
The Mist," Darabont and King do it again!
","Stephen King. You probably know him. The 62 years-old American author is one of the best writers in the horror genre. His novels, novellas, and tales have been adapted to the big screen more than 100 times. All-time classics like Brian De Palma's 'Carrie' or Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining' and many others are all based on his novels. Frank Darabont. You probably don't know him. He is the guy behind two of the best King's adaptations - the 1994's 'The Shawshank Redemption' and the 1999's 'The Green Mile'. And back in 2007, six years after after Darabont's last picture ('The Majestic'), he decided to adapted another King's novel, 'The Mist'. Well, he did a pretty good job.'The Mist''s story is focused on a small group of people that are trapped into a supermarket after a giant mist covers the whole town they live in - a small city in Maine. Afraid of what is outside, they lock themselves into the market - only to find out later that there are blood-thirst creatures hiding in the mist. Among these people, there is David Drayton, a local artist (Thomas Jane), his son Billy (Nathan Gamble), Mrs. Carmody, a very religious woman (Marcia Gay Harden), Brent Norton, a lawyer (Andre Braugher), etc. While 'The Mist' could be defined a a monster movie, it shows more of human relations than anything else. The movie's story is all about how people react to the unknown and the unexplainable. This script, focused on character development ans study, is great, with a excellent storyline and development. The only problem me and most of the critics is the movie's ending. Frank Drabaont completely changed Stephen King's original ending - and for worse. Of course I'm not gonna spoil it here, but Darabont's ending is just plain stupid and doesn't make sense with the rest of the movie. Only if he had sticked to the original ending...The acting here is average. Of course this isn't the kind of movie where the acting is the strongest point, but they did a nice job. At least the movie was well-casted, and while you get a few members doing a good job, like Marcia Gay Harden and Nathan Gamble, in a good performance by a child, others are too normal, like the own Thomas Jane. Of course there isn't no one really bad here, but no one is great either. Nothing award-worth.The directing here is absolutely perfect. This movie wouldn't be the same without Frank Darabont. His directing is calm when it has to be, frenetic when it has to be, sentimental when it has to be, and scary when it has to be. That, combined with a incredible unique style, utilizing all the directing resources, and with a perfect editing, making the movie neither too long or too short make his direction work perfect. The movie''s budget wasn't big. This is proved with the lame special effects and the bad sets. But Darabont did what he could with it. The soundtrack here isn't marvelous either, but sets the mood when it has to. When thing that bothered me was the cinematography - the movie could have a more dark mood.Overral, 'The Mist' is a great horror movie from 2007. Of course it's nothing compared to the previous Dabaront/King cooperations, but it holds its own rights. The script has some really good character study, but it's ruined by the bad ending that Drabont changed from King's original story. Darabont's directing is great here, and the acting is average. Good thriller, a really nice addition to the horror genre.8/10",8,2,5,1 March 2010
Moulin Rouge!," I'm not sure if I appreciate Baz Luhrmann's style...
","When 'Moulin Rouge!' came out, in 2001, its director, Baz Luhrmann, was already 39 years old, but had made only three other movies, 'Strictly Ballroom' and 'Romeo + Juliet'. So, assuming this is only his third film, and the third of his 'Red Curtain Trilogy', he still has a lot to grow as a director, after all, it generally takes years for a director to hit the jackpot, but of course there are exceptions like John Huston and his exceptional 'The Maltese Falcon' as his first movie.'Moulin Rouge!' tells the story of Christian (Ewan McCregor), a young English writer that travels to 1899 Bohemian Paris. There, he meets Satine (Nicole Kidman), the star courtesan of the Moulin Rouge, the main nightclub of the city underworld. The problem is when he falls in love with her, but she is already committed to The Duke (Richard Roxburgh), a very rich man. Throughout the movie, most of the main characters tell the audience that this is a story about Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and above all things, love. And it is indeed. All four of them are a very important part of the story, which is very well-told, by the way, starting off a year after the main events, with Christian writing what happened. And it's all told with really good dance numbers.The acting is nice. We have the two leads, Ewan McCregor and Nicole Kidman, playing their parts well, and singing their own songs. We have other stars like John Leguizamo, Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh. No one really stands out, but you can see the actors did their jobs exactly as they were told to. As I mentioned, Baz Luhrmann still has a lot to grow as a director, but at least the guy has a lot of style. The landscapes of Paris were one of the best scenes I've seen in a musical, great mix-up of 3-D effects and real shots. You can see all his potential in those scenes. This movie is a perfect portrayal of Bohemian Paris, wild, senseless, and weird. The way he mixed up lots of famous songs of the 20th century to tell the story is brilliant. In here, we have songs by Madonna, David Bowie, Ozzy Osbourne, Nirvana and many others, and it works really good. The art direction is excellent, but too modern for my taste. The main problem I have with this movie is the editing, too claustrophobic. When you start to get into one scene, it jumps to another and you get dazzled.Overral, even though I'm not sure if I appreciate Baz Luhrmann's style, it's undeniable the effort he and his crew putted into the making of this movie. The problem I have with 'Moulin Rouge!' is simply a matter of taste - too modern for me.7/10",7,1,2,28 January 2010
Avatar," A true landmark on cinematic history.
","Avatar. The movie everyone's been talking about. The movie that literally almost everyone has already watched. The so-far second biggest box-office success of all time. Winner of two Golden Globes for Best Director and Best Picture. Nominated for 8 BAFTA's. The most probable candidate for this year's Oscar. And I finally got the chance to watch it on IMAX last Thursday. And now I'm gonna post my review.Avatar is set on the year of 2154, when the humans are colonizing and exploring a planet called Pandora. To do so, the humans created a alien/human hybrid called Avatars, in order to talk to aliens and interact with them. There are many races and animals that live in Pandora, but the main ones are the Na'Vi, a people really connected to the nature. But the movie really tells the story of Jake Sully, a paraplegic ex-marine that is forced to substitute his twin brother who had just died and use his Avatar. But he likes the Na'Vi people so much that he now has to choose between being with the Na'Vi or coming back to the humans. The plot seems very complex and interesting, but after some time it becomes cliché and predictable. That's why the script is the main problem I have with this movie. By the end, it already had lots of cheesy lines like: 'Mother nature heard your calling', or 'I don't make the rules. Talk to the stockholders'. There isn't much to comment on the acting here, because there isn't one role in this movie that gives room to the actor to do his best. And it's also hard to act when you're a blue bean. Overral, the acting here is just the way it should be and the way you'd expect: non-existing.James Cameron does a really great job directing this picture. he uses the new 3-D technology in a remarkable way. But the best thing about this movie is the art-direction and the special effects. Pandora feels so alive and breathing, all the new species are different and unique. The special effects are also really impressive. James Cameron and his crew were able to achieve a level of realism never seen before. Although it still has that ultra video game feel to it, it's the best cinematic experience you can see as of 2010. The new technologies developed for the making of this movie and the enhancement of the already-existent ones transforms this movie into a true landmark on cinematic history. Watch it on 3-D is truly an unforgettable experience. But the cliché script keeps this movie alway from been a masterpiece and winning any category on the awards if not the technical ones. Because technically, this movie is perfect. Even for today's standards.8/10",6,1,2,24 January 2010
When Harry Met Sally...," An excellent romantic comedy that's able to remain fresh and original even today
","First of all, I'd like to say that I pretty much hate romantic comedies. I can't stand them at all. They're all the same, have the same plots, the same characters (in most cases) and even the same actors. The only thing that changes in these kinds of movies is the background in which the characters live. But of course there are exceptions, such as the Hepburn/Grant 1938 flick 'Bringing Up Baby', Woody Allen's Best Picture winner 'Annie Hall', and this movie. 'When Harry Met Sally...' is a romantic comedy that was able to be original in 1989 and remains fresh even nowadays, when most movies from this genre copy what it introduced back then.'When Harry Met Sally...' story focuses on the relationship of Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan), covering 12 years of their lives, starting in 1977, when they met in a trip (hence the title), and ending in 1989, the year the movie was made. In these 12 years, Harry and Sally go through many phases. First they hated each other, then they became friends, until they finally realized they loved each other. The story may seem simple enough, but the script written by Nora Ephron - who even got an Oscar nomination for it - manages to tell it in a simple but yet complicated matter, a matter that holds the attention of the viewer during the whole movie. Throughout it, Ephron deals with many themes regarding love, and throws a lot of questions to the viewer, such as 'Can men and women be friends?' and so on. The script also introduces us to concepts that were used in most of other romantic comedies to come, like the idea of both the main characters having close friends who also fall in love, the feelings that the main characters have for each other, going from hate to love during the movie, and so on. And speaking of the main characters, the character development here is nothing but marvelous, which reflects in Harry's case for example: a character that starts off as a ladies' man, and finishes the movie as guy in love for his then- friend. And it's just this change in the characters that makes the movie so great, and specially, believable. Add this to some fantastic well- written dialog, and you got yourself an excellent script.There's really not much to praise in what regards the acting here. Both the main actors do a pretty good job in portraying their characters, but it's not really that stand-off job. Surprisingly, the best member of the cast is Meg Ryan, in probably the best performance of her career. She manages to deliver a very strong performance and convince as that's Sally, appealing to both men and women - like the movie itself. And she did a hell of a job in the infamous fake orgasm scene, which has got to be one of the most funny scenes ever. Like Meg Ryan, Billy Crystal also does an amazing job. In this movie, he's the guy every man wants to be. Apart from the main duo, the other two important characters are jess (Bruno Kirby) and Marie (Carrie Fisher), who do an average job.'When Harry Met Sally...' is directed by the always-great Rob Reiner. I've watched most of his movies, and although this definitely ain't his best work, all can say that Mr. Reiner did a pretty good job directing this picture. Most of the shots don't have much to them, but there are a few scenes where you can watch and say 'Rob Reiner certainly shot that.' And the way he tells the story, interpolating Harry and Sally's story with real couples telling their love-story is a pretty good addiction to the script. I also thought the cinematography here was quite well-done, giving the feeling of New York to the viewer brilliantly.Overall, 'When Harry Met Sally...' is an excellent romantic comedy, that's able to appeal to both men and women. The best thing here is Nora Ephron's very well-written script. The acting is not so great, but it could be worst, though. Rob Reiner's directing made the movie what it is: a romantic comedy that was fresh and original back then and remains so nowadays, even with a lot of the movies from this genre copying many things from 'When Harry Met Sally...'9/10",10,1,2,20 December 2010
Stranger Than Fiction," A pleasant surprise.
","'Stranger than Fiction' was on Cable TV last night and, by having nothing better to do, I decided to watch it, but I wasn't really expecting much, since the main part here is Will Ferrel's and features Queen Latifah, so I though it was one more lame comedy. But when I saw the rest of cast, with Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson, and the director, I got cheered up a little. Marc Foster had directed 'Finding Neverland', a great picture. And by giving this one a chance, what a pleasant surprise I had.'Stranger than Fiction' is a original screenplay by USA-born writer Zach Helm. It tells the story of a methodic IRS agent who wakes up in one morning and starts to hear a voice on his head narrating everything he does. At first, he thinks he is crazy, but when he goes get help he finds out that the voice is of a writer who's writing a novel about him, even though he doesn't know her. He is just a character for her. Although the plot seems weirs, and it really is, the script is very well-written and keeps you interested on what's going to happen with those characters. There lots of intelligent dialogs, and the funny parts aren't forced or out-of-place - it's all exactly were it should be. There also a few memorable lines.The cast here has famous names, featuring also Maggie Gyllenhaal aside from the already quoted names - Will Ferrel, Emma Thompson, Dustin Hoffman and Queen Latifah. And it was really nice to see Will Ferrel different from what he is used to. After this movie, I'm going to see him as a real actor, he just have to choose better projects. Queen Latifah was also a surprise - she was great as the writer's assistant. Maggie Gyllenhaal is lovely as the main character's love interest, and Dustin Hoffman is always great, but the member of the cast that really drew my attention was Emma Thompson. I always particularly liked her, and she is absolutely marvelous on the role of Karen Eiffel, the writer.Marc Foster's direction isn't bad, with some interesting camera-work and the intelligent use of special effects, one thing really rare on today's movies. And talking about those, they were really great, even for today's standards. The editing is also well-made, so is the cinematography. The soundtrack really fits in - another thing that you don't see much on today's movies.Overral, this is a little and funny comedy movie that really makes you feel good. An interesting plot, a great casting ensemble and the efficient directing by Marc Foster are worth the ticket. A few flaws and holes on the script don't ruin the pleasant surprise I had watching this.8/10",8,1,2,24 January 2010
The Lion King," One of Disney's best animated flicks
","The Walt Disney Company is without a doubt the biggest animation studio of all time. They created the genre back in 1937 with 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' and kept making animated movies, even until today. The company holds credit for some truly all-time classics, such as the own 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs', 'Cinderella', 'Sleeping Beauty', etc. But back in 1994, when 'The Lion King' came out, it seemed like Disney was losing its touch, without the magic of the movies in former times. But 'The Lion King' changed that, showing that Disney still had it what it took to make a great movie, and they managed to make one of their best flicks.'The Lion King' tells the story of Sinbad, a young lion, son of the village's king, Mufasa. But the brother of Mufasa, Scar, always wanted to be king, and he feels threatened once Sinbad is born, because the throne goes to Sinbad, not to him. He then performs an elaborated plan to kill his own brother and convince the young Sinbad that he did it. Now Sinbad runs away because of shame, only to be persuaded to come back already as a grown lion and try to rule the kingdom instead of Scar. 'The Lion King's story is assumed as been a crossover of 'Hamlet' and 'Bambi'. It does have lots of elements of both's story, but the movie hold its own rights by telling the story, in a very excellent manner. The character study and development is amazing, extremely well-written script, except for a few parts, where characters make stupid choices, but it's really minor and you don't realize it. One thing I didn't like is the movie's running time, I mean, of course it's a children's movie, but it could run a little longer, showing missing parts like Sinbad growing up with Timom and Pumbaa. And talking about them, these are some of the best and most charismatic characters in an animated movie. They really stole the whole show. And the charisma Timom and Pumbaa have left, the main character doesn't. I really didn't like him, and when he grows up he is just like his father, you can't really distinguish them.The voice-acting in here is truly great. I think that the movie is quite well-cast, with some famous names like Matthew Broderick as the main character, Rowan Atkinson as Zazu, the king's adviser, Jeremy Irons as Scar, Whoopi Goldberg as Shenzi, one of the hyenas, and others not so- famous names, like Nathan Lane as Timon and Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa. In my opinion, the best member of the cast is Jeremy Irons. He managed to put such a depth on the villain, Scar, which I dare to say it's one of the best performances by an actor in a animated movie. It really blew me off. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella were also great as Timon and Pumbaa. Excellent chemistry between both.This movie was directed by two people, Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff. Generally, people say that directing an animated picture is easier than a live-action one, because you can put the camera wherever you want. It's true some times, but the animation has other challenges than a normal picture, and the both directors did a good job, except in the final fight scene. The use of slow-motion bothered me, it seemed like one lame action picture. But aside from this, the rest of the movie is greatly directed and animated. As for the animation, it's simply fantastic, there's nothing more to say about it. It one one the best 2-D animation ever. All the character's moves, the background, the effects of light and shadow, the representation of Africa's nature, the effect of depth and mainly the effects of fire and water are so real, but at the same time they have a beautiful, unique style. Thumbs up for the animators and the art-director, they used the huge movie's budget to animate it perfectly.This movie is also well-known by having one of the best soundtrack of an animated picture. It's true indeed. Elton John's and Tim Rice's songs are great for a children's film, but it's Hanz Zimmer's original music score that sets the mood perfectly. It has such a depth, such a soul to it, it's hard to imagine the movie without it. All the sequences are perfectly composed and executed, but it's the opening scene that still gives me chills every time I watch it. It's one of the best introductions to a movie of all time. That's mainly because of the perfect score and also the great cinematography, another perfect aspect about this movie. It's an animated movie, yes, but it has an excellent cinematography. There some scenes with a groundbreaking photography, the kind of thing to set the bar for others to come. Overral, 'The Lion King' is one of the best Disney's animated flicks and one of the best animated movies off all time. Personally, been a Pixar fan, I still prefer 3-D animation, but I can't deny that the 2-D animation here is excellent, with some great effects. The voice acting is nice, and Jeremy Irons delivered an incredible performance. Hanz Zimmer's original music score is one of the best of all time, together with the cinematography. 'The Lion King' proved Dysney still had it on them to make excellent pictures, but unfortunately they didn't make anything that even comes close to 'The Lion King' after it. It's a true shame.9/10",10,2,3,26 February 2010
The Silence of the Lambs," The perfect psychological thriller
","'The Silence of the Lambs'. This movie literally made cinema's history in the evening of March, 30th, 1992. It was Oscar's night, and Jonathan Demme's thriller went home with all the five major awards - Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role, Best Actress in a Leading Role, Best Director and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, becoming only the third movie is history to ever achieve this accomplishment (the other ones are 1934 Frank Capra's 'It Happened One Night' and 1975 Milos Forman's 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'). And the Academy was perfectly right, as 'The Silence of the Lambs' is easily the best movie of 1991 and one of the best thrillers of all-time. It deserved all the awards it got.'The Silence of the Lambs' is based on one of Thomas Harris' novels about serial-killer Hannibal Lecter. But Lecter only appears in the movie within 13 minutes of runtime. Before that, we are presented to the movie's major plot, that is centered around Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster). Clarice is a young FBI agent that is assigned to the case of Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), a serial killer that skins his victims and then throws them in a river. But in order to gather information for the case, Clarice must talk to Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), the most feared and dangerous serial killer in the world. The story here doesn't have a lot of originality, but the way the movie explains it to the audience is simply amazing. The character development is incredible, the dialogs are outstanding and the montages are breath-taking. I couldn't blink not even for one second, which proves how good the writing is. The first of the five major Oscars was certainly very well-deserved. Thumbs up for Thomas Harris for the novel and for Ted Tally for the excellent adaptation.Now, let's talk about the acting, and there is only one thing to say about it: it couldn't be any better. The whole supporting cast is outstanding, with the exception of Brooke Smith, as one of Buffalo Bill's victims. She was just average, nothing special to it. But the member of the supporting cast that stands out is certainly Ted Levine. He should have been at least Oscar-nominated for his performance as Buffalo Bill, a quite creepy interpretation. Aside from the supporting cast, also composed by Scott Glenn and Anthony Heald, all the attention here goes for the two leading roles. Both Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are perfect, specially Hopkins. Even though he has only 27 minutes of screen-time, Hopkins managed to deliver one of the most memorable performances of the 1990's decade. All his gestures, that creepy coolness, the tones his voice reaches... it's all perfect for the character. None other actor could have done a better job, another very well-deserved Oscar. The other leading role here goes to Jodie Foster. Of course she is not as great as Anthony Hopkins, but she also delivers a very memorable performance. Her naiveness, the hidden South accent, her desperate struggle to impress her superiors - Clarice Starling and Jodie Foster are only one. Again, a deserved Oscar award - this time for Best Actress.The fourth Oscar award this movie received was Best Director for Jonathan Demme. And the guy really impresses you on his directing work. The movie wouldn't be the same nor it would have the same recognition if it wasn't for him. The places Demme puts the camera are excellent, as he did it for the audience to feel in the skin of Clarice Starling. And in order to do this, Demme makes all the characters look straight into the camera, except for Clarice, that never does this, always looking at another direction. There are also a few scenes (most tracking-shots) designed to be like the the eyes of Clarice. And her childhood memories only increases the audience's approach to Jodie Foster's character. Another deserved Oscar-award.The movie was also Oscar-nominated for Best Sound and Best Editing. The Sound here is nothing out of the ordinary, with nice Sound Effects, but a lousy musical score. Nothing that takes away the movie's accomplishments, tough. As for Best Editing, it should have got the award. Craig McKay's editing work is outstanding, as the audience is fooled to believe in things that turn out to be others. I'm not gonna spoil it here, but you are gonna feel pretty dumb once you find out the tricks McKay used. The cinematography here is also nothing out of the ordinary, such as the other aspects. Nothing that's worth mentioning.Overral, 'The Silence of the Lambs' is the perfect psychological thriller. The fact it won all the five major awards at the Oscars only proves my point, and they were all extremely well-deserved. The writing is amazing, the acting is perfect, and the directing is outstanding. You put that with one of the most memorable performances of the decade by Anthony Hopkins, join with a great editing work, ferocious dialogs and an impressive directing, and you have the best movie of 1991. From all the five major awards, the last one was the most well-deserved: Best Picture.10/10",10,4,8,9 March 2010
Slumdog Millionaire," What did everyone saw on this?
","'Slumdog Millionaire' was, without a doubt, the most critically acclaimed movie of 2008. Danny Boyle's picture simply won eight Oscars (including for Best Picture, Director and Adapted Screenplay) and nominated to two others. It also won seven BAFTAs (also, including Best Picture, Director, and Adapted Screenplay) and four Golden Globes, along with tons of other awards, becoming the first movie since Steven Spielberg's 1993 'Schindler's List' to win Best Picture at the Oscars, the BAFTAs and the Golden Globes. The problem is - I'm still trying to figure it out what did all those critics and the audience saw on this movie?'Slumdog Millionaire' tells the story of Jamal Mailk (Dev Patel), a Mumbai teen who grew up in the slums and is participating on a TV program called 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?'. In the break of the program, he is accused and arrested of cheating. While he is being interrogated, events from his life are shown, explaining why he knows the answers to all the questions of the program. The Oscar-winning Screenplay is loosely based on a novel by Vikas Swarup and adapted for the big screen by Simon Beaufoy. Through Jamal's story, the movie denounces the hard life in India's slums, showing all the dangers of that little kids suffer when they're alone. But the movie only shows a poor and filthy India, that's why many people are gonna have wrong ideas about the country because of this movie. Even though the story gives the possibility to show a nice adventure, with Jamal, his brother Salim (Madhur Mittal) and a girl named Latika (Freida Pinto) trying to survive in the slums, it is hardly believable. It's impressing how everything in Jamal's life sort of conspires for him to know the answers, how he remembers his childhood in so many details and how the questions are all related to his life. This bugged me throughout the whole movie, but the final question was the most forced one. I'm not going to spoil it here, but you'll see how nonsense it is. I know the basic plot of the movie is how a kid from the slums can win a TV game-show, but that's where I have the problem with.The acting here is a little under average. All the supporting cast does an average job, with the exception of Anil Kapoor, that was very nice as the game-show host. The three main characters are portrayed at three different ages here. Surprisingly, the best members of the cast were the little kids. Even though most of the cast are newcomers, the kids steal all your attention here. All three of them, portraying Jamal, Salim and Latika, are great, and give strong performances. The not-so-little kids that portrayed the three of them in an early-teen age were fine also. The ones that had more recognition were, of course, the actors portraying them in the late-teen age. They were the ones with more screen-time, but not of them were really good. Madhur Mittal was kinda bad as older Salim, so was Freida Pinto as older Latika. And even the most acclaimed one, Dev Patel, wasn't really good. Even though he got a few nominations for his role in this movie, his performance could've better.Undoubtedly (or at least in my opinion) the strongest point of 'Slumdog Millionaire was the directing. Danny Boyle does an excellent job directing this picture. If it's not his best work thus far, since he was also excellent in both 'Trainspotting' and '28 Days Later...', it's certainly one of the best. The camera work he uses in the movie is incredible, getting some unbelievable shots. His job in the transition of each scene is also remarkable. Another good thing that I enjoyed on Mr. Boyle's job were the montages, that served to make the movie much less boring. The only thing that I didn't like on his work was the end credits. After all the events depicted in the movie, every actor started dancing on a train station to the sound of A.R. Rahman's original Oscar-winning song 'Jai Ho'. I know it was meant to be a tribute to the Bollywood pictures, but in my opinion it ruined the movie completely. Your good and old black end credits were just fine, thanks.Chris Dickens was another one that really deserved the Oscar award he got. His editing work is as remarkable as Danny Boyle's directing one. If it wasn't for him, the montages and the shot transitions weren't gonna be as good as they are. Anthony Mantle's Oscar-winning job on the cinematography was excellent. The yellow tones in every scene really set the mood for what's to come, and make the movie feels like India. You get some beautiful shots of India's famous locations and landscapes, like the internationally famous Taj Mahal (of course they had to show it). One quite important thing on 'Slumdog Millionaire' is the Soundtrack. A.R. Rahman composed several songs for this movie, and they are all quite good. Aside from the montages, the movie also utilizes those songs in a very, almost surgically put way. The only time that the music didn't serve well was in the end credits.Overral, 'Slumdog Millionaire' is not a bad movie. Is not a bad movie at all. Danny Boyle's directing work was of the his best so far, the editing is great, so is the cinematography and the Soundtrack. But the naive writing, the hardly-believable storyline and the poor acting keeps this movie alway from being a masterpiece. And the dancing at the end credits served to make the movie worse than it is, ruining the movie's mood completely. So, with all this, I'm still trying to understand: What did everyone saw on this? Even though 2008 wasn't exactly the best year for movie-making, with the writer's strike and all, there certainly were better choices for the Oscars, the BAFTAs, or whatever awards you mention, than this picture.6/10",6,3,4,22 March 2010
