The New World," Very boring movie
","Yawn, this was a very boring flick. Almost nothing happens in this movie, and the very few interesting that happen in this flick happen after a lot of boring, endless scenes without nothing interesting about them.The only good thing about this movie were the performances and the photography (Specially the performance of Colin Farrell) There were some nice shots, that were beautiful to look at, but that's all.'The New World', just like all the others movies made by Terence Malick are quite boring, dull and meaningless. No wonder why so many people compare him to Stanley Kubrick, considering that both made boring, overrated flicks with zero emotional involvement.Again, this is a very boring flick.",2,1,3,20 May 2011
Scarface," Terrible
","This movie was awful, there wasn't any single good thing about it.The performance of Al Pacino was dreadful and laughable, also all the characters of this movie are all boring and despicable.The only good film of Brian DePalma was 'Carrie'. His other films are all boring and horrible, and 'Scarface' is not the exception.I just don't understand what is the big deal about this movie. It was horrible and boring from beginning to end, there wasn't anything good about it.'Scarface' must be one of the worst movies ever made, and it is way overrated and boring.",1,10,24,14 September 2010
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Great addition to the spectacular Twilight franchise
","This movie was beautiful and moving. It was an excellent addition to the spectacular Twilight franchise.I had all the good element from the previous Twilight films, and it seems like the beginning for a epic, dramatic conclusion of the Twilight saga, which is one of the best franchises in the history of modern cinema. No, I'm not kidding, or being sarcastic: Just like many terrible action flicks are way over-hyped, the 'Twilight' films are underrated and under-appreciated. (And personally I think that the books were underrated too, specially on the Internet)This was one of the best romantic films ever made, and it was one of the best films that I've seen in the recent years. I cannot wait to see the sequel. This movie was just magnificent.By the way: I am the only one who noticed the little 'Avatar' homage made at the end of the movie (Notice the close-up at the eyes of Bella in the last frame of the movie and compare it with the ending of Avatar) Anyway, it was a nice reference.'The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1' was a well directed and enjoyable film. Honestly, I don't see why it receive so much hate and bad reviews.",10,2,8,8 February 2012
Ghost," A masterpiece
","Ghost is one of the best romantic films ever made, It is simply beautiful, a very intense romantic drama, with some bits of fantasy and comedy, and lots of heartwarming and captivating moments. The song of the Righteous Brothers 'Unchained Melody' fits perfectly with the story and the tone of this film.The performances of Patrick Swayze and Whoopi Goldberg were simply outstandingDemi Moore performance was just average, but that doesn't affect the film at all.'Ghost' is one of the best romantic films ever made, and it had a powerful, emotional ending. This movie deserves more appreciation and recognition. It is awesome.",10,0,2,25 September 2010
Casablanca," Timeless masterpiece
","This is one of the best movies ever made. I loved every single aspect about it. The romantic story, the characters,the music, the performances (Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman bring us here one of the most memorable performances of their entire careers) This is an almost perfect film: Even the single minor flaws this film could have are compensated by every single element of greatness and brilliance.I love most of the classic films, and 'Casablanca' is not exception. Everything about it was great and memorable, and this film deserves the timeless classic status that it have until this very day. It is not only of the best romantic films ever made, it also, one of the best movies from all the history.",10,0,1,15 May 2011
Finding Neverland," Beautiful film
","I usually hate films aimed to children, because I don't like children very much, but I loved this film. I found it moving, inspiring and heartbreaking. I found this film to be very good, mostly because of the performance of Johnny Depp, which is not only were handsome, but also a great actor. I loved him in this film, his character was simply adorable, and his performance was much better than the one of Kate Winslet, who gives here a weak and boring performance, just like always. But besides that, this was a great film, filled with moving and inspiring scenes, and lots of heartwarming scenes. The ending was so sad that I almost cry. It was just so heartbreaking. However, it is a wonderful film, for all the family.",10,1,2,10 September 2010
Citizen Kane," Timeless classic
","'Citizen Kane' is such a masterpiece.It deserve all the good reviews and praise it receives...Even when I'm not sure if this is actually 'The best movie ever made', definitely it is a great film, with lots of memorable scenes, unforgettable characters and excellent performances.Every single frame of this movie is beautiful, and the direction is simply flawless.The main character of 'Citizen Kane' is iconic and Orson Welles bring us here an incredible performance.This is one of the greatest films ever made. It is a timeless masterpiece, completely unforgettable from beginning to end.",10,1,2,19 May 2011
Underworld," Awful, just awful
","All the 'UnderWorld' films are terrible. There is no single good thing about those dreadful movies, all about them suck. This movieIs like a clone of 'Van Helsing' (Also a bad movie) combined with 'The Matrix' (An overrated movie') There wasn't any good thing about this movie. It was terrible from beginning to end. The story is bad. The characters are lame. The special effects were quite poor.The music was bad.'Underworld' is an awful movie, without any single redeeming value.0/10",1,0,11,25 September 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Great sequel
","'Pirates of the Caribbean' is one of the best adventure franchises of the recent years. It is a incredibly funny and exciting combination of adventure, action, fantasy and comedy, with excellent results.The performance of Johnny Depp is magnificent, and his character (Jack Sparrow) is one of the most memorable and fascinating (And also funny) characters of all the history of the cinema.The rest of the cast was incredible here, too. All their characters were great.The special effects and the music were excellent, and create a great atmosphere of adventure. It is epic, exciting and enjoyable.'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' is a great sequel of the first film, and even when it is not so good as the original film, it is still an excellent and funny flick for the whole family.",9,0,1,19 May 2011

Hostel," Horrible film
","I hated this film. There wasn't a single good thing about it.What happened with good horror films? Now modern horror films are no longer scary, just disgusting and sadistic.This movie was unbearable. The performances were terrible and the script were quite poor, pretentious and annoying. All the characters (Both the victims and the villains)were despicable and irritating.This was twisted and sick, but not in a good way. Why a good director like Quentin Tarantino accepted to put his name in such a bad film this? I just don't get it.I can't believe this atrocious film had a sequel. The first movie was bad enough.",1,1,3,8 January 2011
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Good for children
","The Chronicles of Narnia were good movies for children. I usually hate films about children or about stupid animals, but this film was okay. 'The Chronicles of Narnia' are very good films because they teach many important things to the children about faith and God, and I found that to be pretty good. Even when this film is not as good as 'The Passion of The Christ', it is still a pretty good film, with many Christian values, and that's why it deserves appreciation and recognition. The effects and the performances were good too. This film is appropriate for the family viewing. Also the music and the songs were pretty good too. I wish they were more family flicks as this.",9,0,1,12 September 2010
The Notebook," Simply excellent
","This was an incredibly beautiful, marvelous movie.I just don't why it gets too much undeserved hate. It could easily considered as one of the best romantic films ever made, and personally I found it to be very inspiring from beginning to end.While most modern movies usually don't inspire me to read the book in which many of them are based, 'The Notebook' was good enough to awaken my interest for the source material, and I have to say that Nick Cassevetes did a great job capturing perfectly well the mood and essence of the original novel.I found 'The Notebook' to be an excellent film and I honestly wish there were more movies like this. Nowadays, almost every movie seems to be filled with an overload of CGI or some superhero/fantasy stuff (While I have to admit some fantasy and superhero films can be incredibly good, I 'm starting to become tired of the over-saturation of both genres)",10,1,2,30 August 2014
Brokeback Mountain," Good, but kinda overrated.
","'Brokeback Mountain' was a goo movie, but way overrated. There have been a lot of movies about gay love or gay couples that were critically acclaimed, but most of the reviewers talk about this film as it was the first movie ever made about homosexual love, which is not true.Despite that, this movie was enjoyable and well directed, unlike other boring and pretentious dramas that always win the Academy Awards for Best picture.The performances were good (But I think that the performance of Heath Ledger in 'The Dark Knight' was better) and the characters were interesting. The last scene was very emotional and dramatic.Despite some boring scenes, this film was worth-watching and well made. But I still must insist that this movie was overrated.",7,1,7,8 January 2011
500 Days of Summer," Funny, clever and heartwarming
","This is probably one of the best romantic comedies that I'ever saw in the recent years. The plot was interesting, original and unpredictable (Completely opposed to the bland and formulaic romantic comedies that appear every year) Also the characters were interesting and very, very likable.I liked the combination of comedy and drama, not to mention the incredibly good performances. The good was very good too. I loved the plot development and the ending was quite satisfying. Unlike other cynical movies as 'Closer' or 'Alfie' it avoids the typical ending of almost all the romantic comedies, but without being cynical or pessimistic.This is the kind of movie that make you feel good. The whole experience was rewarding and fulfilling.",9,0,2,8 January 2011
Juno," Funny, clever and well made
","I don't think that this movie was overrated at all, actually I think that 'Juno' deserved all the appreciation and good reviews that it received.It was a funny, clever film, with lots of heartwarming scenes, an intelligent script and very likable characters. The performances were excellent, specially the one and all the development of the story was unique and pretty interesting. The music of this film was pretty good too.'Juno' was an excellent film, and it was one of the best movies to be released in such a lousy year as the 2007. It had a good message, and it is one of the best movies about teens ever made.",9,2,3,20 January 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," A great third part
","'Pirates of the Caribbean' is one of the best adventure franchises of the recent years. It is a incredibly funny and exciting combination of adventure, action, fantasy and comedy, with excellent results.The performance of Johnny Depp is magnificent, and his character (Jack Sparrow) is one of the most memorable and fascinating (And also funny) characters of all the history of the cinema.The rest of the cast was incredible here, too. All their characters were great.The special effects and the music were excellent, and create a great atmosphere of adventure. It is epic, exciting and enjoyable.'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' it's a great third part of this excellent franchise, it has all the fun and excitement of the two previous films, but also a darker and more serious tone that makes the story more interesting. It is a perfect ending for the trilogy directed by Gore Verbinsky (Yes, I know that there is another 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movie coming this year, but even when I expect it to be good, I'm not sure if it would be so good as the original trilogy)",10,0,1,19 May 2011
X-Men," Great comic book adaptation
","'X-men' was one of the very first good adaptations of a comic book into a movie. Unlike many of other comic book adaptations that came years before this one (That were cheesy, boring and poorly made) this movie took itself seriously and had a great direction, good performances and great special effects.Bryan Singer did a great job with the 'X-Men' comics, making an excellent adaptation, that made justice to the original material, and also works very well as a flick completely independent of the original comic books.The sequel was even better, and the third part was a decent ending for a great trilogy. This movie was quite good!",9,0,1,20 May 2011
The Adventures of Tintin," The best animated film of the recent years.
","I have to confess that I don't like very much animated films, and I also never read a Tintin comic in my life.I also I am not a big fan of Steven Spielberg. I don't hate his movies, is just that I think his works are somewhat overrated. (Well, he made a couple of good movies, such as 'Jurassic Park', 'Schindler List' and 'The Color Purple', but I am not a fan of him)However, this 'Tintin' CGI animated movie was very good, being very funny to watch from beginning to end. Since I never read the comics, I can't compare the movie with them, with as a movie independent of the comics, it is very good and enjoyable. The CGI IS very well made, many sequences very impressive to watch. It was also much better than many of the recent animated films from the last years. This was a very good film, and it is the best movie that Spielberg have done since 'Schindler List'.",10,0,3,8 February 2012
The Expendables," Terrible film
","'The Expendables' is such a terrible film.Sylvester Stallone just wants to repeat the success of those awful 'Rambo' films (That were all bad, but the Expendables is even worse)'The Expendables' doesn't have any single good thing: This movie practically has no plot, the characters are all annoying and unlikeable, and all the film was boring and tedious.Don't believe the hype. 'The Expendables' doesn't deserve all the praise that it is receiving.This film is just not that good. In fact, it is a terrible, worthless film. 'Twilight' was much better.",1,6,14,10 September 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The beginning of an excellent trilogy
","'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy made by Peter Jackson is easily one of the best fantasy flicks ever made. Not only the visual aspect of those three movies surpasses any single fantasy movie to be released before this film, but also the story was magical, captivating and unforgettable, with great characters, excellent performances and beautiful music.This was one of the most incredible films ever made, I think those three 'Lord of the Rings' flicks are the greatest achievement in all the history of cinema, and the only movie to be almost as good as those movies was 'Avatar' from James Cameron.'The Fellowship of the Ring' is the excellent beginning of a great trilogy, and is possibly one of the best literary adaptations ever made in the history of film. This movie was excellent from beginning to end, being epic, emotional and thrilling.This movie is magnificent, and it is one of the best flicks ever made.",10,0,1,20 May 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Decent film
","All those Harry Potter movies were just okay. The books were funny enough, and all the movie adaptations were decent and satisfying. I'm not a big fan of those book, but I liked them. Daniel Radcliffe was a very good choice as Harry Potter, he is very handsome and talented. The performances, the script and the special effects were good enough, not as good as better films as 'Avatar' and 'Watchmen', but were good. My only problem with all the Harry Potter films is that all of those movies are pretty long. Since those book and movies are aimed to children they should be shorter, I guess. All the Harry Potter films are good, but I still prefer 'Avatar', because 'Avatar' has aliens, and I love aliens.",7,0,0,20 January 2011
Wanted," Do Not Want
","This movie was awful. Everything about it sucked.The visuals were horrible, the visuals of 'Watchmen' were much better.The characters were annoying and stupid, I hated all of them. Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman played some stupid and uninteresting character in this ugly mess.The plot was basic, childish and predictable. It was like those boring 'Rambo' films, lost of action without plot or any interesting character.This movie was awful, and doesn't have any single redeeming value. It is one of the worst films ever made, and it deserves zero stars, because it is a pretty bad film.'Wanted' is a horrible film, there wan't anything good about it.",1,2,6,12 September 2010
The Patriot," One of the worst films ever made
","This was a pathetic film. the action was lame, and the direction was boring and mediocre at best. The performances were incredibly bad, specially the one given by Mel Gibson, an actor which I personally found to be incredibly overrated.This is possibly one one of the most boring and worthless 'historical' films ever made, where the only 'epic' thing about this movie is how bad it is.It is not surprising that it was directed by Roland Emmerich, a talentless hack who also made boring and dumb 'disaster' flick as 2012, Independence Day and the atrocious remake of Godzilla.'The Patriot' is a terrible film with no redeeming value.",1,14,30,1 September 2011

Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Impressive film
","This is a great movie. I was expecting to hate it, since from trailers I could see that this movie was clearly influenced by anime and video games (Two things that I hate with passion) so I was really impressed to see that it was actually a very good film, with lots of clever and intelligent jokes.The characters from this film were very likable and interesting...Personally I think that Michael Cera acting was magnificent and perfect for the character he was playing. The visual aspect from this movie was very good too, all the action scenes were incredibly well made and were funny to watch at the same time.The love story between Scott and Ramona was the best element from this movie, and it was the main reason of why this fantasy flick was so enjoyable. This was a very good combination of romance, action, fantasy and comedy. It was one of the most enjoyable films that I've seen, and even when I'strongly dislike anime and video games, I really liked this movie and I recommend it t anyone.",10,2,5,8 February 2012
Resident Evil," Atrocious
","This has to be one of the worst films ever made. It is so dumb and unimaginative, that I almost fell sleep. It was just too boring and stupid. Everything about this film was bad: The effects were lousy and poorly made compared with much better films as 'Avatar' and 'Watchmen'. The acting was terrible, and all the characters were unlikeable and generic. Also the plot was weak and derivative of many other zombie movies, without nothing of originality. I never played the original video game (In fact, I hate videogames) but I know about good films and good stories, and I have to say that it is one of the worst films ever made. This film was terrible from beginning to end. 'Resident Evil' is one of the worst action films ever made. It also fails as a horror film, because it is not scary at all.",1,1,7,10 September 2010
Independence Day," Terrible.
","'Independence Day' was awful. The acting and story were poor, simply poor. There was nothing good about this film. Even the special effects were mediocre and poorly made. 'Avatar' of James Cameron and 'Watchmen' of Zack Snyder were way better than this film: Both films had superior special effects and a much better story than this stupid B-movie.'Independence Day' is just lame. Don't believe all the hype about this film, it is one of the worst science fiction films ever made. No words can describe how bad is this film. Compared with 'Avatar', 'Independence Day' has the same level than any episode of the Power Rangers. And even the Power Rangers were better than this trash. Avoid this film like plague.",1,3,8,8 September 2010
Twilight," Beautiful, underrated film
","This has to be one of the most beautiful and moving movies ever made. The story was so original and touching that it almost move to tears. No, I'm not kidding: Just like those terrible 'Rambo' flicks are way over-hyped, the 'Twilight' films are underrated and under-appreciated.This was one of the best romantic films ever made, and it was one of the best films that I've seen in the recent years, along with 'Avatar' and 'Watchmen'. It had romance, action and very good special effects. I just cannot understand why would someone hate such a great film like this. 'Twilight' is one the best literary adaptations ever made.",10,0,5,10 September 2010
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Awesome
","The most amazing saga of fantasy films (I'm talking of course of the great 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy directed by Peter Jackson) is back, and it is just awesome as ever. I was worried about the possibility of this movie to receive the same kind of backlash that the Star Wars prequels (To be honest, I like the Star Wars prequels, but most of the critics and internet reviewers seem to hate those movies) but fortunately this movie got the good reception that it deserved, having all the good elements from the original trilogy: An epic and inspiring story, likable characters, spectacular visual effects, a great production design which is above the most of the stuff done by Hollywood in the recent years, likable characters, a good balance of seriousness and comedy...There wasn't anything which I didn't like about this movie. I was a perfect prequel which actually leave me wanting to see more.I just hope that the two next films from 'The Hobbit' were just as good as the first one. This movie was excellent in every possible way!",10,3,9,19 September 2013
The Princess Bride," Great adventure/romance flick
","'The Princess Bride' is such a great film. There were many fantasy flicks on the eighties (And some of them were incredibly good, as 'The Neverending Story') but this has to be best of them.It was incredibly enjoyable and funny to watch, basically, it is a parody of the classic fairy tales, but it is not a dumb and shallow spoof like horrible movies such as 'Dance Flick' or 'Meet the Spartans', instead of that it makes fun of several of the clichés that appear in many fairy tales. And, at the same time, it has lots of adventure, and heartwarming moments, specially the ending.It also has a beautiful love story...Not many parody films have that.'The Princess Bride' is a great film for the whole family. It has fun, excitement and lots of heart. It is definitely one of the best movies ever made.",10,1,2,14 February 2012
Revolutionary Road," Powerful drama
","This was such a great film. Unlike many other boring 'oscar-bait' films, this actually deserved all the praise it received.This film was made by Sam Mendes, the same director of the overrated 'American Beauty' (But he also made two good films, such as 'Road to Perdition' and 'Away We Go') I must admit that when I heard about this film for the first time, I wasn't very interested about it, because I thought it was going to be like 'American Beauty', but in the Fifties, but this movie turned out to be pretty good, with many powerful and emotional scenes.The performances were excellent, and the cinematography was equally good too.Personally, I think that 'Revolutionary Road' was an excellent film, and I found this to be superior in every single aspect to American Beauty. This is a good, underrated film that deserves more recognition.",10,0,0,1 September 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A great second part

This movie was excellent from beginning to end, being epic, emotional and thrilling. It was also darker than the original film, but that was good.This movie is magnificent, and it is one of the best flicks ever made.",10,0,1,20 May 2011
Across the Universe," Great musical
","This was a great film.I always have been a big fan of the Beatles, and I think that this movie made a incredible work using the most famous songs of that band in order to create a completely new story. And the final result is more than excellent: In fact, this must be one of the best musicals that I've ever saw, along with Moulin Rouge.This movie combines an incredible story with incredible visuals and incredible music. Of all the movie that I've ever saw in the recent years, this has to be one of the most satisfying and impressive.Jim Sturgess shines as the main character, and the rest of the cast made an excellent work as well. I loved every single aspect of this film, and it is one of my all-time favorites.",10,1,2,1 March 2011
Stardust," Great fantasy flick
","This was one of the best fantasy films that I've ever saw, along with 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy. It had lots of humor, romance, and adventure, and excitement. It was very funny to watch from beginning to end, it had a charming story, great visual effects and lots of interesting characters. Also, the performance of Robert De Niro was excellent and was much better than most of his recent roles. If you like good fantasy flicks as 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Princess Bride', then, this movie is for you. It was an excellent fantasy film, being both charming and captivating.",10,2,3,2 March 2011
The Hurt Locker," Overrated drivel. Avatar was much better.
","How come this boring and dull movie won the Academy Award for Best movie in the year 2010? This movie didn't deserved it, it was just another inane and boring 'Oscar-Bait' film just like 'The Reader' and 'Slumdog Millonaire' filled with lost of angst, 'important' themes and nothing of fun.This movie didn't deserve the Awards it get.The other nominees, like 'Avatar' and 'Precious' were so much better than this film. And were more way enjoyable and better directed.'The Hurt Locker2 is just an overrated drivel that nobody will remember in a few years (Or maybe even less time)",2,2,4,1 February 2011

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Beautiful, underrated film
","I loved this film. Personally, I think it was one of the best movies of the 2008, and it was much better than other overrated Oscar-bait films such as 'The Reader' and 'Milk'.The story was strange, but good, and also beautifully filmed. The performances were incredibly good, specially the one given by Brad Pitt.Just like 'Big Fish', this movie is a underrated, misunderstood masterpiece that deserves more recognition: It is true that is slow-paced, but it had lot of memorable and heart-warming scenes. The ending has to be one of the best endings ever made in the story of cinema, being powerful, poignant and heart-warming at the same time.This is a incredible film. I loved it.",10,2,5,23 April 2011
Paranormal Activity," Good, but overrated
","'Paranormal Activity' is a good, but kinda overrated horror film: The major problem of this movie is that it tries too hard to be a 'realistic' horror movie like dreadful films as 'Cannibal Holocaust' (That wasn't realistic at all) and 'The Blair Witch Project' and 'District 9'.However, I liked the main actor; he was very attractive and charismatic. On the other side, The girl (I mean, the character, not the actress) was annoying and irritating, I hated her. The movie would have been much better without her character. However, it was just an adequate film. This film wasn't as good as 'The Sixth Sense', but it was good movie, with some scary parts.",7,0,2,12 September 2010
The Dark Knight," A masterpiece
","Most of the films inspired in comic books are quite bad, like the boring two films of 'The Punisher' and 'Daredevil'. (Or even worse, 'Elektra') Also the movies made by Joel Schumacher about Batman were awful and unwatchable. Fortunately 'The Dark Knight' was an excellent film, suspenseful and quite well made. The action scenes were exciting and well made, I never taught than any movie inspired in a comic book could be this good.Christian Bale was just perfect as Batman, and Heath Ledger gives a outstanding performance as the Joker. At first, I thought that people was exaggerating about this film, and that it was overrated, but when I saw this, I could easily see why so many people say very good things about it.'The Drak Knight' deserves all the hype that it receives.",10,1,5,8 September 2010

Alice in Wonderland," Don't listen the haters.This was a good film
","I just can't understand why this good fantasy flick gets so much hate, while overrated drivel as 'Black Swam' gets so much love, hype and good reviews.Even when this wasn't a masterpiece like the book (In fact, it is quite different from the book) it still was a funny and enjoyable film, that gets so much undeserved hate.The CGI of this movie was decent: Even when it didn't have the same level of quality of 'Avatar' it was much better than the other CGI that you see in most of the recent animated flicks. Also the performances and the music were pretty good, making the whole thing enjoyable and charming.'Alice in Wonderland' was a good film. It wasn't a masterpiece like 'Big Fish', but it still was a pretty good movie for the whole family. Tim Burton is a good director, which never made a bad film.This film is not the exception to that rule.",8,1,3,1 February 2011

","I'm not very much into the films of James Cameron, in fact, I hated 'True Lies' and 'The Terminator Saga'. But I loved 'Avatar', mostly because I'm very interested into alien life forms and that sort of things, and because this is one of the best alien films ever made. The technology and special effects are just incredible, and the performances and the script are quite good, and the story, despite being somewhat clichéd, was very inspiring and beautiful. I loved this film. Along with 'Watchmen' I consider this to be one of the very few good movies of the lousy year 2009. I simply cannot understand why someone would dislike such a good film as this. I can't wait to see the sequel!",10,2,7,8 September 2010
Invictus," Important film
","I was never a big fan of Clint Eastwood (In fact, I found most of his movies to be boring and overrated) but I loved this film. It was very well directed, and has some important themes (Just like many 'Oscar-bait' films, but the main difference is that this was actually good) Matt Damon and Morgan Freeman are excellent in this film, both made a incredible work in this movie, which it is not only inspiring and well made, but also entertaining and enjoyable (Not like tedious and ugly films as 'Slumdog Millonaire') 'Invictus' is not overrated at all, in fact, this was way underrated: It wasn't even nominated for the category of best picture in the 2010, while overrated movies as 'The Hurt Locker' and 'District 9' got the nomination. That was unfair and wrong, specially considering how great is this film.",10,2,5,1 February 2011
Life Is Beautiful," Such a great film
","'Life is Beautiful' is one of the best movies ever made: It is so emotional, deep and powerful, that is hard to not love this film.Roberto Beningni makes here the best performance of his entire career, the movie balances very well the comedy, the drama and the romance with very convincing performances and a great script.I do'n't think this movie is overrated, in fact, I think that it is completely underrated, it was easily much better than that overrated and boring mess called 'Titanic', which was a pretty bad film, that didn't deserve to win the Academy Award for best movie (Okay, I have to admit that I loved 'Avatar', but that was a much better film, also it didn't have the annoying Kate Winslet) This movie was wonderful, it deserves more appreciation and recognition.",10,3,6,14 September 2010
Rio," A good movie to watch with the family
","Okay, I must admit that I'm not a big fan of animated movies, but I recognize that some of them could be very good (Like 'Beowulf') However, I don't like very much the recent CGI movies (Like the ones made by Dreamworks, I guess I prefer the classic animated films made by Disney) However, I think that 'Rio' was a nice, little film, very good to watch with the whole family. It has comedy, music and romance, and the characters are cute and likable. It was very funny to watch, and it was very enjoyable, from beginning to end. The animation, despite not being spectacular, was very well made, with cute designs and nice colors.Even when 'Rio' is not a masterpiece, it is still a good film to watch with the whole family.",7,0,1,14 July 2011
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Okay
","All those Harry Potter movies were just okay. The books were funny enough, and all the movie adaptations were decent and satisfying. I'm not a big fan of those book, but I liked them. Daniel Radcliffe was a very good choice as Harry Potter, he is very handsome and talented. The performances, the script and the special effects were good enough, not as good as better films as 'Avatar' and 'Watchmen', but were good. My only problem with all the Harry Potter films is that all of those movies are pretty long. Since those book and movies are aimed to children they should be shorter, I guess. All the Harry Potter films are good, but I still prefer 'Avatar', because 'Avatar' has aliens, and I love aliens.",7,0,2,12 September 2010

War of the Worlds," Boring and stupid film
","This movie was overrated and boring, just like the movies of Stanley Kubcrick. The plot is stupid, the earth is invaded by some aliens. That had been done to death before. Also, Why the aliens are the bad guys? Aliens are awesome and cool. All the movies with bad aliens are stupid and childish. Also, we don't see many aliens on this film: Most of the time we see the annoying and talentless Tom Cruise trying to hard to give to save his boring family. That was boring and stupid. If a film is about aliens, they should have give more screen time to aliens, rather than the boring humans, like it were one of those corny movies from Lars Von Trier. 'Avatar' was much better, and had much better special effects.",2,2,6,12 September 2010
August Rush," Excellent
","'August Rush' is such a beautiful and underrated film. It was easily one of the most endearing, adorable and inspiring films of the recent years. The plot was beautiful and charming; everything about it was incredibly good. I absolutely loved this film. The performances and the direction were excellent, and all the characters were likable and interesting. The music was great too, I never saw such a good use of classic in a film: Unlike the horrible films of Stanley Kubrick were the beautiful classic music were combined with terrible stories and a atrocious cinematography, his movie combines both excellent music and a excellent story. 'August Rush' was, in my humble opinion, one of the best and most underrated movies ever made. It was excellent from beginning to end, and it deserves a lot of more appreciation and recognition.",10,1,2,25 December 2010
Stranger Than Fiction," Very good
","I never thought that Will Ferrell could act this good.In most of the movies that I've seen with him, he plays very bad roles, doing almost always the same annoying character.But in this movie, he acts completely different. It is a comedy (Or better said, a dramatic comedy) but he plays here a very serious (And interesting)character. His character in this movie was completely believable and likable, all the opposite of the stupid characters that he usually plays in other films.'Stranger than Fiction' was a great film, it has very good performances, likable characters, and a surprising and unpredictable story. This movie definitely deserves more recognition. I just cannot understand of how come this movie didn't receive any Academy Award. It was one of the best movies of the 2006.",10,1,2,25 September 2010
Hancock," Han-Crap
","This movie was awful!The performance of Will Smith and the rest of the cats were beyond bad.But that wasn't the worst thing about this stupid and worthless movie, the worst thing about this stupid and ugly mess, it's that the plot is so boring, stupid and irritating, that I couldn't watch the whole thing. Also it was poorly filmed. The visuals were ugly and unoriginal.This movie was simply unwatchable...It is easily the worst superhero movie ever made. If you want to see one good superhero movie, see 'Watchmen' or 'The Dark Knight' which are much better this pathetic movie.'Hancock' it's a complete waste of time, and it is one of the worst movies ever made.",1,12,20,7 December 2010
Inception," Great film
","Inception was such a great film. It was easily the best movie of the 2010.The plot was interesting, original and well made.The performances were all incredibly good, specially the performance of Leonardo Di Caprio.The atmosphere and the special effects were simply perfect, and all about this movie was incredibly good.I used to thought that 'The Drak Knight' was the best movie of Christopher Nolan, but 'Inception' is even better than that movie (Don't misunderstood me: 'The Dark Knight' was awesome, but 'Inception' was even better) This movie is a masterpiece.",10,2,7,14 September 2010
Blade Runner," Very good movie
","Very good science-fiction film that has some elements of classic detective films (Something that was quite original for the time it was made) Some people say this movie is overrated, but I think that this movie deserves all the praise and good reviews it receives: The visual aspect of this movie was revolutionary and influential for many movies that came later. Also, along with Alien (From the same director of this movie) and Star Wars, this must one of the best classic science fiction films ever made.Harrison Ford gives here an incredible performance. I really liked all the characters of this movie, all of them were interesting and fascinating.'Blade Runner' it is a very good film. Maybe the development of the story is a bit slow, but it is still a masterpiece, that not only is beautiful to look at, but also has a unique and fascinating story.",10,4,9,27 April 2011
Beowulf," A great achievement
","Usually, I don't like very much animated films, and also, all the previous adaptations of the Beowulf poem into the big screen have been horrible(Like for example, that horrible movie starring Christopher Lambert) However, this movie managed to be both interesting and enjoyable,also having incredible special effects and CGI. The story and the characters in this movie were quite interesting, and unlike the other previous 'Beowulf' films, the main character was very well developed, with a realistic and fascinating personality.I don't know why this movie gets so much hate: It is easily much better than the CGI rubbish animated films that are released every year, and even when the CGI is not so good as the CGI used in films like 'Avatar' of James Cameron, it was still pretty good.This is a underrated masterpiece, and it is a great achievement for animation in general.",10,5,8,23 April 2011
Amélie," Charming, magical film
","'Amelie' is a charming, adorable film.Despite being a bit strange, this is still a lovely romantic comedy, with an incredible visual aspect, and great performances.The main character was unique and the performance of Audrey Tautou was completely unforgettable (And easily the best performance of her entire career) The rest of the cats was great here, too.I loved every single aspect of this film. It is one of my favorite films from all the history, and I would recommend it to anyone. I don't think this movie is overrated at all, in fact it deserves even more praise and raving reviews. It is that good.",10,6,11,19 May 2011
The Sixth Sense," Very good film
","This was a very good film. In fact, this is the only good film made by M. Night Shyamalan. All his other movies were terrible, but this one was pretty good.The performances were all pretty good: I usually hate the movies with Bruce Willis (Specially 'Die Hard', that movie was awful) but here he made a good role, and also he plays an interesting character. I really liked this film. It was quite scary: In fact, I would say that is one of the scariest films ever made, even more than ridiculous films as 'Cannibal Holocaust' or 'Hostel', that were no scary at all, just disgusting. 'The Sixth Sense' is a perfect horror film. I recommend this film to anyone, it is very good and deserves all the hype that it receives.",10,0,1,10 September 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," The best Harry Potter film
","All those Harry Potter movies were okay. The books were funny enough, and all the movie adaptations were decent and satisfying. I'm not a big fan of those book, but I liked them. Daniel Radcliffe was a very good choice as Harry Potter, he is very handsome and talented. The performances, the script and the special effects were good enough, not as good as better films as 'Avatar' and 'Watchmen', but were good. My only problem with all the Harry Potter films is that all of those movies are pretty long. Since those book and movies are aimed to children they should be shorter, I guess. All the Harry Potter films are good, but this was easily the best of all the Harry Potter movies in the franchise, being the most entertaining and satisfying. I really liked the last scene.The second part of 'Deathly Hallows' was a great ending for the Harry Potter Saga, and it made me appreciate even more the story and the characters.",8,0,0,1 September 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The perfect ending for a flawless trilogy
","'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy made by Peter Jackson is easily one of the best fantasy flicks ever made. Not only the visual aspect of those three movies surpasses any single fantasy movie to be released before this film, but also the story was magical, captivating and unforgettable, with great characters, excellent performances and beautiful music.This was one of the most incredible films ever made, I think those three 'Lord of the Rings' flicks are the greatest achievement in all the history of cinema, and the only movie to be almost as good as those movies was 'Avatar' from James Cameron.'The Return of the King' is the excellent third (and last)part of this great trilogy, and shares all the good elements of the two previous film. This movie was excellent from beginning to end, being epic, emotional and thrilling. The battle scenes were memorable and magnificent: The ending was perfect and closes in a satisfying way one of the greatest movie franchises ever made.This movie is magnificent, and it is one of the best flicks ever made.",10,0,1,20 May 2011
The Thin Red Line," Overrated, boring and dull
","No wonder why Terrence Malick is often compared with Kubrick, considering the fact that, just like Stanley Kubrick's movies, Terence Malick's films are painfully boring and overrated.And of course, critics love them. But personally, I found this film to be tedious, pretentious, endless, stupid and boring. I mean, there are much better war movies than this one (Like Platoon or Apocalypse Now) Not even Jim Caviezel or Sean Penn are able to save this movie of being a incredibly boring.Seriously, this has to be one of the most boring films that I've ever saw. It was a complete waste of time, just like other movies directed by Terrence Malick.",1,7,13,1 March 2011
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Great, underrated film
","This has to be one of the most beautiful and moving movies ever made. The story was so original and touching that it almost move to tears. No, I'm not kidding: Just like those terrible 'Rambo' flicks are way over-hyped, the 3 'Twilight' films are underrated and under-appreciated.This was one of the best romantic films ever made, and it was one of the best films that I've seen in the recent years, along with 'Avatar' and 'Watchmen'.It had romance, action and very good special effects. I just cannot understand why would someone hate such a great film like this. 'Twilight: Eclipse' is one the best literary adaptations ever made.",10,1,9,7 October 2010
Jurassic Park," Okay, but somewhat overrated
","This film was one of the very few good films directed by the overrated director Steven Spielberg. It wasn't terribly boring as awful films like 'A.I.' or 'The War of the Worlds', but this wasn't great either.It was an decent, funny action flick with some incredible special effects (Though the effects of films as 'Avatar' or 'Watchmen' were way better, and also had more interesting plots) The plot and characters weren't very original either: I guess that Steven Spielberg tried to repeat here the success of his Indiana Jones films (That weren't that good anyway) Still, it was much better than most of the other Steven Spielberg films.",7,1,4,7 October 2010
The Wizard of Oz," A timeless classic
","This is such a great film. It's easy to see why so many people loves this film: It aged very well, having a incredible visual aspect, with beautiful colors, a great, dream-like atmosphere, great make-up effects, and excellent songs, being all of them unforgettable, awesome and catchy.Everything about this movie it's so beautiful and whimsical that makes me miss the years where this kind of movies could be made: 'The Wizard of Oz' is an exciting and adorable film, with lots of memorable scenes. It is easily one of the best fantasy movies ever made, and one of the best adaptations of one kid's book into a film(Even when this movie isn't exactly like the book, it still have the magical spirit of the source material, and it works incredibly well as a completely independent movie) I loved this film. Modern kid's movies aren't just as magical as this.",10,5,6,14 July 2011
