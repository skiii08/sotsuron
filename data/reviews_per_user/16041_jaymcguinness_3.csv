Hereditary," Ari Aster pens a fresh modern horror with his first movie and Toni Collette is terrifyingly good
","Hereditary doesn't have many negatives at all. It is a refreshingly good horror in a genre that relies on too may of the same old jump-scares and basic plot devices.Written and Directed by Ari Aster, his first movie, Hereditary is a fantastic opener for the American. One of the main takeaways for a horror is to leave the viewer talking about and remembering the scares. Hereditary certainly achieves that. The plot feels different, certainly in how it builds and some of the scenes are certainly memorable. I am looking forward to Aster's second movie Midsommar later this year featuring the excellent Will Poulter.Speaking of the cast, Toni Collette is simply outstanding in this movie. So much so, that she is in for Oscar contention. Her expressions in many scenes are simply terrifying on their own. The great thing about this movie is that this performance doesn't even need to carry the movie, the supporting cast is also good. Alex Wolff as the son, is also outstanding and he is involved in all of the major and scary scenes in the movie. Milly Shapiro plays a character that is particularly well written and she pulls off the creepy sibling with ease. Gabriel Byrne who plays the most sane character in the movie also is his typically solid self.I need to mention the cinematography also, some of the scenes are really well shot. The house in particular, which reminded me of some of the hotel rooms and lobby in The Shining, was a very good choice. The open plan living area just added to the tension in one major scene with Collette, Byrne and the fire.Overall, this is a very enjoyable watch for any horror fan and Ari Aster is definitely one to watch as a writer and director in this genre. 8/10",8,4,7,7 January 2019
Lucy," Writer Luc Besson, famous for Taken and Leon turns Scarlet Johansson into Sarah Connor
","Lucy is a sci-fi, action movie written and directed by Luc Besson. The movie feels like it's split in two with the first half starting out fairly plausible and by the end of the movie grows into heavy CGI and sci-fi.Luc Besson is famous for Taken, Leon, The Fifth Element and The Transporter. He is a very good writer. This film leans more towards The Fifth Element in its levels of sci-fi and plausibility but I personally believe Leon and Taken are his masterpieces.The acting in the movie is good for an action movie, never likely to receive Oscar nods. I thought Min-Sik Choi was very good as the dictator boss and Morgan Freeman was his usual composed and impressive self as The Professor. Scarlet Johansson had some memorable scenes in the movie and she pulled off the change in her character superbly.The way the film shows the origins of humanity and the development of time, particularly in the end sequence is very impressive and well done.I was a little disappointed with the Soundtrack. I thought this movie could have done with something similar to the Drive Soundtrack or Tron...or even Terminator. Such distinguishable OST's from the action/sci-fi genre. But other than a few main scenes in the movie it lacked memorable backing.This movie is very similar to The Terminator and has elements of The Matrix. In fact, during many scenes in the movie I thought that Scarlet Johansson reminded me of and would have made a great Sarah Connor when it was remade.Overall, I would recommend this movie. It's an entertaining watch from a very creative writer and the plot is very interesting. 7/10",7,6,10,27 December 2018
Green Book," The Oscars frontrunner that is equally funny and heartwarming. An outstanding biographical drama
","Green Book is directed by Peter Farrelly and is an Oscar contender for sure. That sentence is one that is still hard to fathom. That is because Peter Farrelly's previous credits as writer and director are for Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary, Me,Myself & Irene, Shallow Hal and the awful Three Stooges and Dumb & Dumber sequel. He's a comedy writer. He has some great movies in that genre no doubt but this is such a huge leap in a biographical drama that is a commercial and critical success that it is a career turn that nobody seen coming. Yes, there are several laugh out loud moments in this movie and Farrelly will have been able to engineer those scenes to be as funny as they were. Nevertheless, this is still a huge achievement for the producer, director and writer and I hope he is acknowledged on the ultimate stage.It is hard to speak of the plot to this film in such a brief description. That is because throughout the entire movie you really get the feel that everything played out on screen did actually happen. There are several reasons for this but mainly it is because of the involvement of Nick Vallelonga as co-writer, the son of the real life Tony Vallelonga in the movie. You get the sense that his involvement really added an authenticity to the story and he was able to project his vision and history of his late father onto screen.Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali are both excellent in this movie. The characters themselves are very entertaining but Mortensen in particular really brings the Italian-American bouncer to life and he adds a charm and humour to the movie. It is amazing how well he pulls off Tony Lip when you compare it to his other roles in The Lord of the Rings, The Road and his 2 previous Oscar nominations Captain Fantastic and Eastern Promises. It really is a brilliant performance and it's a shame that once again he is likely to fall just short this year in the Leading Actor category. Mahershala Ali just goes from strength to strength. With his Oscar win last year for Moonlight still in the rear view mirror he adds another string to his bow here and I am looking forward to his turn in True Detective Series 3 this year. The pair of them have great on screen chemistry together and you really connect with the journey that they go on as a viewer.I can't speak highly enough of this movie. It is a heartwarming tale of companionship and friendship at a time when circumstances prevented it culturally, socially and professionally. I would highly recommend this film and I think it has a real chance of winning Best Picture at the Oscars 2019. 9/10",9,7,14,20 January 2019
