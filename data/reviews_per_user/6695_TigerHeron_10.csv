The Lobster," A Good Idea Run Wild
","There are some good ideas in this movie, but it is too long, and the longer it goes on, the more grotesque it gets. The ending is ambiguous and ultimately a cop-out. It becomes a hard movie to watch.The first half of the film, which is mostly set in the hotel, is interesting. The idea of people being threatened, coerced and coached to fall in love is only one step beyond the real world insanity of speed-dating and other atrocities. The film seems to be mocking society's conformism with black humor.In the second half of the film, the story gets confused and more frightening. It involves a tribe of single people who are just as vicious as the hotel staff, perhaps more so. A romance develops that appears to challenge the abusive tribe's leader's authority, but in the end, it's not clear whether the main characters have truly risen above their circumstances. I found this depressing and wasn't sure what the message was supposed to be.Something else I didn't like about this film is that there are two female characters who are completely evil, whereas the men are mostly bumbling along. I found the film to be slightly misogynistic.",6,1,4,31 May 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," McDonagh's American Commentary
","Martin McDonagh has his virtues and his flaws. His virtues are quirky, not entirely realistic but engaging characters, his talent for irony and surprises, and his ability to tap into the darkest recesses of human emotions. His flaws are his lack of ear for dialogue and his mommy issues. All are on display here.This movie is a good exploration of the rage that can be engendered by grief. Frances McDormand gives a gritty, powerful performance. I didn't find Sam Rockwell's character to be realistic, though, and some of the events stretched credulity. There's a scene or two lifted straight out of some of McDonagh's previous works. It's an engaging, meticulous movie and I enjoyed it. I don't think McDonagh understands America, but some of the emotional themes ring true.",8,1,3,1 March 2018
Bird Box," It's just stupid
","I'll be honest, I only watched the first 45 minutes. The premise is completely absurd. The dialogue is cringe-worthy. Nobody speaks or acts the way anyone does in real life. This is a 'B' horror movie that for some reason was totally hyped and they got Sandra Bullock to star in it! I don't know how the world is going to end, but if this movie is the best Netflix can do, then we are definitely seeing the decline and fall of western civilisation. I'm giving it 3 stars for Sandra Bullock. By the way John Malkovich has apparently forgotten how to act.",3,8,10,29 March 2020
The Revenant," A for Effort, C plus for Story
","The best things about this movie are the beautiful scenery and cinematography, the top-notch acting and some interesting dream sequences. But what is it all for? Everyone knows the plot: Somebody killed my (insert loved one) so I'm going to kill him. Have we not seen this a thousand times? Is it really different when shot in the wildernesses of Canada, Montana and Argentina? I almost walked out of the movie after the bear mauling scene. Many have criticized this scene, but what troubled me about it is that a supposedly experienced woodsman would be unaware that you have to flee if you see bear cubs, and if the bear attacks, you're supposed to lie still. Also from what I know an experienced woodsman would be able to tell that a bear was in the vicinity and would leave the area as soon as possible.The movie improved in the last half because the action heated up and there was more dialogue. Tom Hardy deserves an Oscar and DiCaprio deserves a Purple Heart. There was some minor drama involving a third character. I'm just not sure this simple story deserved the enormous amount of effort that went into making this film.",7,10,18,17 January 2016
Get Out," Fun Thriller; Not Racist and Not Political
","People are way overthinking this movie. It's not a social/political satire. It's not racist. Yes, it does make fun of white racist stereotypes of black people, but nobody in their right mind would think the writer/director actually thinks most white people think like the mad scientists in this film do. This is a basic thriller, a piece of old-fashioned movie-making. It is inspired by the classic 'The Stepford Wives' which did something similar with sexism as this film does with racism.The plot involves a young black man who is taken by his girlfriend to visit her parents for the weekend. The family has black servants who act weird. Although the plot unfolds in a somewhat predictable way, the movie is elevated by intriguing parallels that involve the main character's childhood trauma. The mom is a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis, and being a hypnotherapist myself I can say that although these scenes exaggerate the power of hypnosis, they don't exaggerate it by much.There are a few surprises, but what I liked best about this movie is the strange recurring motif that involves the main character's trauma. We see his weakness but also his strength. That made this film a cut above standard horror/thriller movies.By the way this movie is not very violent; it's about average for a suspense movie. If you want a slasher movie with a lot of blood and gore this isn't it. It's a thinking person's movie.",8,10,19,28 May 2017
The Shape of Water," The Amazon's freshwater but whatever
","This is an entertaining, even charming fairy tale, if you can suspend not only disbelief but also knowledge and critical faculties. The story appears to have been inspired by 'Creature from the Black Lagoon' although it is a fantasy/romance rather than a horror movie. It has many similarities to Del Toro's 'Pan's Labyrinth,' so if you liked that movie, you will probably like this one. Like 'Pan's Labyrinth' it has a horrific torture scene, but unlike that film also has graphic sex. This is not a movie for persons under 14. The main theme of this film is the outcast. Set in the early 1960s, it ties together the lives of a variety of social outcasts including the amphibian monster. Del Toro and his crew do a good job creating the setting and mood. The acting and the costumes are stellar. Then why can't they get some basic geographical and historical details right? A creature from the Amazon lives in freshwater, not saltwater. The Soviets recruited Americans to be moles; they didn't somehow graft a Russian into America and have him pass as 'Bob.' The Bob/Dimitri character was beyond ludicrous (although if he had been presented realistically as an American or as a Soviet double agent his character would have been realistic and more compelling. It's sad because I liked the character). Again Hollywood insults our intelligence. But despite all I enjoyed this film, seeing it as a simple fairy tale on a child's level despite the sex and violence. If you like fairy tales (and I do) you will enjoy it.",8,18,32,17 December 2017
The Witch," Garbage
","I watched this movie because someone told me it was about religious hysteria. I think there was a miscommunication. This movie is a stupid horror movie that makes no sense whatsoever. When it was over and there was no logical explanation for anything that happened, I felt cheated even though I watched it for free on Amazon Prime. The movie is about a family that leaves a 17th century American community due to some type of conflict about worship. They try to make it on their own but things go wrong. I kept waiting for an explanation for all the things that happened that made no sense, but it never came. When we finally got to the end, there was a ridiculous scene that was straight out of a 17th century ignorant person's fantasy. We're in the 21st century; hello. It was exploitive and insulting. This movie is too stupid for anyone over the age of 6 but too violent for anyone under the age of 14, so it is inappropriate for all ages.",2,2,6,13 October 2016
Mudbound," Novelistic Storytelling
","This is the kind of movie people who read books love. Although the plot spans less than 10 years, it has an epic feel. Family relationships, racism, poverty and combat trauma are intertwined in the story of two families and the Deep South culture in which they live in the early to mid 1940s. A white land-owning family and a black tenant-farmer family are interdependent on each other, both poor, the black family only more so. Despite trauma and brutality (one scene is especially violent), the movie was not depressing. The reality of the dependence of farmers on the weather, the land and luck is a subtle theme in the background of this film about characters. The ironic experience of black soldiers who fought for a still-segregated home country returning to that culture is the films' dramatic crux. There are probably many historical lessons for younger people in this film.",9,1,5,15 April 2018
Black Panther," Bam! Pow! Ouch!
","This is a comic book action movie. It is fine for an average 17-year-old boy. Anyone with a college degree, persons over 50 and children under 12 should not see this film. It's violent and kind of stupid.The best part of this movie is the CGI landscapes of the fictional kingdom of Wakanda. Otherwise, it's bam, smash, pow. I've been trying to figure out why so many people rave about this film and I concluded it's because of its black power message. I would rather watch a documentary about the civil rights movement. This film is absurd, which is fine for a comic book movie aimed at teens, but to try to find some type of 'message' here is a waste of your time. I was also amused that the hero is an absolute monarch, like that's something black people (or anyone) should think is a model of a government.",6,0,1,2 June 2018
Mad Max: Fury Road," No Mad Max here; sorry
","There's some of the old films' magic here. Clever costumes and rigs and props made from scrap metal, with nutty personalized touches. People with crazy names. Some exciting actions sequences in the last half of the movie. But the main character, who gave the previous films their heart and soul, is gone. There's no Mad Max here. I don't even know who the stand-in is, but he has no personality. Charlize Theron is physically imposing but doesn't get to do a lot of acting. The supporting actresses are just eye candy for hetero men, their flimsy desert wraps artfully placed to just barely cover the naughty bits. The plot is a well-worn scheme about a tyrannical ruler who uses control of resources and a bogus mythology to suppress the masses. I guess if you haven't seen very many movies this would seem original. If you are over 40 you have seen this all before. Somewhat enjoyable but not inspiring.",6,8,16,13 June 2015
