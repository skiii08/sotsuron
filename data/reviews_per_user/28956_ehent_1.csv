Iron Man 3," My simple complaint...
","Ben Kingsley was why I wanted to see the movie. Maybe that was my mistake. I thought this was going to be a villain driven movie. Where the villain was so charismatic and powerful that for a second you thought somehow he would win. Kinglsey has the ability to pull that off. Kingsley's voice in the previews had me so excited for his interpretation of the Mandarin. I'd simply have preferred no strange twist where Kinglsey wasn't an over-the-top, British, stereotypical wimp. That alone would have made the movie somewhat more tolerable. You don't waste a talent like that. Surely a shame.Second point, the comedy. The preview needs to match the movie's direction. I don't want to be led to see one type of movie, and then see something way out of left field of what I was expecting. I wasn't expecting something super dark, but I also wasn't expecting an over-the-top, cheesy comedy bit. I did think there would be a lack of action compared to the first two, but not to be filled with so much cheap humor. I felt very mislead. Mislead to the point where I still feel like I haven't seen the movie from the preview. I didn't hate Iron Man 3. I just don't really feel like I've even seen it.",1,3,7,4 May 2013
