E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Is it just me?
","Am I the only person on the planet who thought that E.T. was an evil, ugly, scarily deformed little freak? This film terrified me as a child and, whilst I might not have understood all the films messages, I knew I was the only one in that room who was too scared to move. It's like a kids horror film; just as you think he's dead, the evil-goblin comes back to life. Not that Spielberg is not a good filmmaker, oh contraire. He used that pot plant as a superb fear-inducing plot device as he did Jaw's dorsal fin and the whole wobbly-water thing in Jurassic Park.Okay, my feelings about this film have been generated from a bad experience, but one thing really, really bugs me about this film. Evolution. E.T.'s species is a super-intelligent race that has mastered space travel and is exploring the universe. So why haven't they got legs? Look out E.T! A reasonably aggressive animal is chasing you! Oh too late, you've fallen over. I cannot believe that anywhere in the galaxy could a species evolve without any basic self-survival abilities (E.g. Walking, eating, shame). Put some clothes on you demonic pixie!For me, this film rates along side Child's Play and those Leprechaun films. Thank god a sequal was never made. I don't think I could take it.",5,2,6,6 October 2002
Spice World," Damn these mis-guided husseys...
","Back in the nineties, I was a self-respecting, free-thinking young woman who wasn't boxed in by stereotypes or other people's expectations. I didn't shout about it or shove down anyone's throat or claim to be the first women ever to have to have a brain. Neither did I make some crapper-than-Moonwalker, extended pop video. Who do those Spice Girls think they are? Only Michael Jackson?!Next thing I know, Destiny's Child is telling me 'It ain't easy being independent' and sexually frustrated men are telling me I'm trying to look like Lara Croft.Exactly what is Girl Power? Should Powergen be worried? Is it a way of describing some sort of extra quality that women have that gives them the right to be loud, brash and irresponsible or is just some marketing-executive's dream sound bite?Whatever it is, I can't escape it. The Spice Girls created a pigeonhole around me, made from a titanium-kyrptonite alloy. So damn you Spice Girls, damn your platform shoes and Union Jack dresses. Damn you're Prince-Charles-arse-pinching and Nelson-Mandela-flirting. Damn your eating disorders, fluctuating weight and inevitable, ironic spiral into self-obsessed media prostitution, that ultimately is a mockery of the whole empowered-girl thing, which will lead to a lonely end of an untalented career.PS When will Mel C release the follow up to Northern Star? I totally loved the album!",Null,0,1,6 October 2002
Pan's Labyrinth," I've never cried so much at a film...
","Incredibly powerful film with such an intense threat of violence throughout that I was an emotional wreck by the end of it. I felt everything that Ofelia did and at no point could I guess or anticipate what was going to happen as I was so involved in the immediate moment. The amount of violence shown is not particularly great but what is shown is brutal. For the majority, it is the sense that the villains are capable of such hateful and inhumane acts that you fear what they will do next. The magic is dark and foreboding and you are never quite sure of Pan's true intentions. A real fairy tale for adults and one of the best films I have ever seen.",10,8,18,11 December 2006
