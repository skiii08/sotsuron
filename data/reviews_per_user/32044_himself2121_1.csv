Insidious: Chapter 2," Terrifying
","This movie was terrifying, even scarier than the first one. Let me start by saying I love the insidious series. I saw this movie on opening day, and i wasn't expecting much due to the fact that sequels usually aren't as good as the original. But man, was I surprised. This movie was a thousand times scarier than the original!! It makes the first one look like a kids movies. The imagery was terrifying, and the jump scenes, and the plot. Although, the first one had a better story, this one had the better scares. Some people actually walked out of the theater crying from this movie, i was amazed. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror movies, it is very scary. Although i suggest watching the first one first, because you'd understand this one a bit better. I can't wait for the third one. Although it probably won't be as good. They got real lucky with the first two, I don't think they can pull it off again. But i hope it's good.",8,0,0,29 July 2014
