Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," captain jack is back
",finally captain jack is back to his best after the third film i was thinking that was the end of the franchise but thank god this new film lives up to the hype. this film has gone back to basics and is very similar to the first one i must say i didn't miss kiera or orlando johnny depp gives another fine performance in this one as does mrs cruz i wont give any spoilers but one thing i will say if your going to see it in 3d beware most of the film is at night and the 3d makes it even darker and honestly i didn't notice what was 3d and what wasn't overall this film does what it says gives you humour romance and action all in one film pirates is back and better then ever,7,1,2,18 May 2011
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Cant understand all the hate
","Going into this film I knew there was going to be split opinions on it but it's not really that bad a film are parts of it rushed definitely, is some of the plot a little hard to believe yeah but what this film does do is give you a 2 hour nostalgia trip about everything star wars is some of it too much yeah but if you try not to think about it and let yourself enjoy the film and worry about the problems with the disney trilogy later but I am glad this is the final chapter in the saga.",8,5,14,19 December 2019
The Amazing Spider-Man," Spider Man is back !
","going to watch this film my expectations was high i liked the first 2 spidermans but the third one went too far, this reboot however was just what was needed for the franchise the film is more faithful to the comic and to the cartoon i used to watch as a kid Andrew Garfield is the perfect peter parker he has humour and really seems to understand the character. Emma stone is way better as the love interest the villain is the only slight problem with the film as you never really are convinced hes evil just a very confused person but this is the first film so the villain can be dodgy overall the film is a good reboot and i cannot wait to see what happens in the sequel. P.S stay a little bit after the credits roll up there is a scene with Dr Conner's is prison.",8,2,14,4 July 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Simply Amazing !!!
","going to see the dark knight rises my question was how do you top the dark knight and i was given my answer this film is simply amazing the sound the action sequences everything is perfect Christian bale is excellent once again as batman tom hardy is the perfect actor for bane Anne Hathaway simply steals the show with every scene as cat woman, Nolan has done an amazing job making this film simply the biggest movie iv'e ever seen it has a run time of 2 hours 45mins but it never drags there is always's something happening and i almost forgot to mention that Gary oldman once again did a excellent job as Gordon. the film ends with everyone at peace and with Robyn entering the batcave hopefully they wont make another film as i don't think it can beat this.",10,2,5,22 July 2012
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," its a good film but....
","batman vs superman the film that launches DC's cinematic universe is a good film but like everyone else I've spoke to since I've seen it there is a but. Firstly the good points Ben Affleck as batman is the show stealer he looks the part and is a good Bruce Wayne as well, the music sound and cgi was good , the last 40 mins of the film are awesome. Now for the slightly negatives this film goes on maybe 20 mins too long for the first 1 hour and 30 mins you are wondering to yourself when is the film going to get going. another negative for me would be the ending why end the film trying to get you to buy into the fact superman is no more normally when hero's fall in movies I feel emotional this time I felt nothing as I know he's superman he will be back in the justice league maybe its just me. overall this film is good but could have been so much better with a tweak here or there for now marvel are still the kings of superhero movies.",6,1,4,1 April 2016
