Walk the Line," A Must See!
","I'm a huge fan of Johnny Cash and was, at first, a bit worried that this film wouldn't be very good, yet being a Joaquin Phoenix fan, I had to see it. I have to say, it was awesome, and exceeded any and all of my expectations. I have to encourage you to see it in the theater, b/ c music is such a big part of the film, I don't think it will be the same experience if you see it in on TV. I plan on catching this in the theater again (yes, it's that good) and will buy the DVD. Joaquin Phoenix is not only spot on in terms of the singing (which is an amazing feat in itself) but plays such a convincing hurt and deeply troubled character. At one point, I was balling, and I don't cry in movies. I also bought the soundtrack and am amazed at how close he really came to capturing Johnny. I have both versions in my itunes and cycle between them, sometimes not really sure which one is signing. He got snubbed at the SAG awards and deserves the Oscar, a truly awesome performance in acting AND singing. Go see it NOW.",10,0,0,7 February 2006
