Walk the Line," Can't Look Away
","I am not a country music fan at all. I always respected Johnny Cash and his huge influence over today's music, but I am by no means a big fan of his. That is, I should say until I saw this movie. When I got home from seeing it, I immediately ordered 'Live From Folsom Prison' and 'Live From San Quinten' on Amazon.This wasn't a movie at all really. It was a two and a half hour tour de force of incredible acting, great music and storytelling. You just don't get bored for one second, and can't look away the whole time. Joaquin Phoenix's performance in this film is one of the best acting jobs in recent years. He isn't acting like Johnny Cash, he IS Johnny Cash. Reese Witherspoon is also great as June Carter. The fact that Phoenix had never sung or played guitar before this movie was filmed caused me to wonder how he was going to pull this off. But his rendition of 'Get Rhythm', and 'Cocaine Blues' in the Folsom scene are some of the best music performances in movie history. He takes over the screen and just kicks your ass. It is hard to believe that he is not a professional musician.The music performances are enough to make this film worth seeing. But the love story between these two, the way that June and her family helped him back from his drug addiction are what gives the film its heart. I would recommend this film to anyone, Johnny Cash fan or not. If you don't like him now, you will when the movie is over",10,20,32,21 November 2005
Million Dollar Baby," Heatbreaker
","The most emotionally involving movie I have seen in many years. The only film that has made me cry in the theater since I saw 'E.T.' when I was 8. Great acting all around, with Morgan Freeman anchoring this great cast. Now I saw it without knowing the surprise ending, and it comes as a total shock. Our hero Maggie had taken on the boxing world by storm and made a lot of money doing it. By her last fight she is taking on the female boxing champion. Her family doesn't want her and she has no boyfriend. All she has is her boxing family. That is what makes the end so heartbreaking. She would rather die than go on living without being able to fight anymore. This is one of the best movies in a long time to come out of Hollywood. Clint Eastwood cements his legacy as one of the best directors of all time, and gives his best acting performance since 'Unforgiven'. Hillary Swank elevates herself to a league of her own. She is a beautiful woman who is talented enough when playing 'regular' characters, such as the cop in 'Insomnia'. But as a female cross dresser in 'Boys Don't Cry' and in this film as a musclebound boxer, she takes it to a level most female actors couldn't. You can tell how hard she worked to make this role believable because when she boxes you forget it is Hillary Swank in the ring.",10,3,6,5 March 2005
The Departed," Ass Kicking Good Time
","Since this movie is coming out Tuesday on DVD, I have to remember the night that I saw it. It was opening night, and we went to a theater in Lawrence, MA which is a pretty tough area. The theater was packed, and from the first ten minutes the crowd was going crazy. Whole groups of people were cheering or laughing out loud at some of the films funnier lines. It was the best experience I have had at the movies since 'Gladiator'.Being a huge Martin Scorsese fan, I was thrilled to see him get back to the gritty movies he was so famous for from 'Mean Street' to 'Goodfellas'.Of course the movie is violent, but not in a gratuitous 'SAW' type of way. When Billy Costigan punches the guy in the bar, he breaks his hand. That is what really happens when you punch someone that hard, and little things like that make the film stand out to me. Being from the Boston area, I know all about what a sicko Whitey Bulger was. Frank Costello is loosely based on him, and Jack Nicholson's performance was chilling. Asking the girl if she had gotten her period yet was something that the pederast Bulger would have done.Nothing against Mark Wahlberg, but I felt that it was Matt Damon who deserved the Oscar nomination. Colin Sullivan was a sociopath, someone with the looks and charm who will cut your throat when you aren't looking. He was based on John Connely, the scumbag FBI agent who was Bulger's lookout for 25 years. I felt that this was Damon's best performance yet because it was so against his nature. He was just so unpredictable in this movie.Everyone will be talking about the Oscars and if Scorsese will finally win. With a movie like this, it will be great if he does it on his terms, and not trying to pander to the voters with films such as 'The Aviator'. This is one of his best movies ever, and anyone who likes mob movies will love it, Oscars or no.",10,4,8,7 February 2007
Casino," Great Cure For Insomnia
","To me, a shocking misfire from great director Martin Scorsese. This movie could have been great, but it was really miscast. Robert De Niro is a great actor, but he was wrong for this movie. For one, he doesn't even bear a slight resemblance to the real Ace Rothstein. He is just sleepwalking through the entire movie, and his cigarettes seem to be more animated than he is. Sharon Stone is good in her role, but she is just so unlikable that you don't feel any sympathy for her. Same for Joe Pesci. He has none of the humor that he brought to his role in 'Goodfellas', where he played another mob psycho.That is why I hate this movie, because all three lead actors are so unlikable that you don't care what happens to any of them. Only the supporting cast, led by Don Rickles and Alan King breathe any life into this movie. James Woods is great in his limited role as well. Funny how you sympathize more with his scumbag role than you do with the other three. Woods could have been the lead in this movie. It just goes on FOREVER, and there are long stretches where you feel like nothing happens. A great cure for insomnia.This was the last Scorsese/De Niro film, but hopefully not the last. Scorsese seems to have gotten his balls back with 'The Departed', and it would be great if someone would write a good script for these two.",3,6,16,10 February 2007
