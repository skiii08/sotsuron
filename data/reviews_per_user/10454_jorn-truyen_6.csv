Requiem for a Dream," A disturbing and memorable cinematic experience
","Disturbing. I suppose that's the best summary of my experience, watching Darren Aronofsky's 'Requiem For a Dream' for the second time. This stylish drama has a great deal to give in terms of style and story. Basically, the film's about four people dealing in their own way with an addiction. Harry (Jared Leto), his companion Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and his girlfriend Marion are heroin fiends, trying to scrap enough money together to escape from it all. Television is Sara Goldfarb's (Harry's mother, Ellen Burstyn) drug, and thinking she's going to be on a game show, she is determined to lose weight and begins a pill-diet.On the surface, addiction is central in this film. But honestly, I think 'Requiem for a dream' isn't about addiction, but rather about trying to get away from it all, alienation, an escapism which creates a division between the real world and the dreams. All four drug-addled characters strive to escape from reality, which they almost seem to achieve but then fall back into the real world. Sara wants to lose weight so she can wear her red dress and feel younger again. Aronofosky covers these interesting human themes with the motive of drug addiction, and that makes it a very sad film. This film stays with you, and Aronofsky gives you this lasting impression with the great climax. The naturalistic plot of deterioration has a shattering climax, enhanced by the soundtrack. Everything comes together, it is a climactic mix of drama, horror, sadness, relief, acceptance.Aside from the story, 'Requiem for a Dream' is even more about atmosphere. extreme close-ups of the characters' sweaty faces, long tracking shots and time-lapse photography create an atmosphere of mystery, sadness and tragedy. Aronofsky shows the characters isolation via these devices: Harry and Marion are lying together but the close-ups only show one character; In one of the most impressive scenes of the film, the time-lapse technique shows a lot of people hovering around Sara, while she wanders around the city, isolated. Furthermore, Burstyn's acting performance is just at the right level, the soundtrack is excellent and I mean to give a compliment when the film reminded me of a certain Stanley Kubrick.",9,3,5,1 September 2014
The Hustler," Shattering and utterly brilliant
","If you love films, you just have to see Robert Rossen's The Hustler. Even though it centres around a very talented pool player, it is far from a run-of-the-mill sports film. Paul Newman portrays 'Fast' Eddie Felson in the performance of his lifetime. Eddie is a small-time pool hustler who travels far to play the reigning straight pool champion Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason) and he's prepared to risk everything. In the process, he develops a relationship with the booze-addled girl Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie). They have a 'contract of depravity'. Rich bookie Bert Gordon (George C. Scott) tries to eliminate Piper to get the maximum out of Eddie. In the shattering climax, Eddie realises that he has been playing the wrong game, with the dramatic results that follow.One notion that makes The Hustler such a great film is its brilliant acting. The classic supporting cast members (Laurie, Scott, Gleason, McCormick), three of which received Oscar nominations, is original in that every character is unique in its portrayal. The powerful Scott, sitting in the dark cigarette-smoked poolroom, is the source of evil throughout the movie. Gleason's performance is equally brilliant due to its subtleness, Fats barely has any lines, but plays a magical part with his movement, his dancing around the pool table. However, Paul Newman tops them all. Gordon tells Eddie he's a born loser, and we eventually know that this has little to do with the pool game. Eddie is a handsome, talented man but he's self-destructive and can't seem to come to terms with the dark world in which he lives, and this dramatic irony is omnipresent. He gives (indeed, donates) us a subtle but equally powerful performance, which perhaps only Brando could have pulled off. When Eddie finally leaves the poolroom, he and Fats conclude the film with the utterly great words: 'Fat man, you shoot a great game of pool.' 'so do you, Fast Eddie.'Indeed, this movie's energy and enigma is largely due to the choice for black and white. As the slightly disappointing sequel by the great Scorsese proves, it just isn't the same in colour (despite the Academy Award for Newman). The shadowy, mysterious aura that hangs over the pool room creates such a magical atmosphere, in which everything could happen. Roger Ebert was very right when he said that excluding 'black & white films' from your repertoire is an indication of your cinematic illiteracy.",10,1,2,12 June 2014
Drive," Brilliant and hypnotic
","Nicolas Winding Refn has created a masterpiece, with the 2011 crime drama 'Drive'. Ryan Gosling is a mysterious, unnamed stranger (sound familiar?), who just drives. The plot is certainly, with moments of romance, excitement and horror. Just as 'Mulholland Drive', of which 'Drive' often reminded me, this is a film which touches on all emotions. What's more, the word film doesn't give enough credit to it; it is an experience and it certainly struck a chord with me. If ever there was a movie where 'style over substance' was applicable, it's this one. Again reminiscing 'Mulholland Drive, 'Drive' has such an incredibly beautiful, hypnotic style, which just sucks you into the movie screen. It takes from all genres, and that makes it the more special. The synthpop soundtrack conveys a certain magic and dreaminess, which result in a unique cinematic experience. 'Drive' is a film that teaches you about film, but more importantly, about life, love and suffering. For all its violence and passion, it still doesn't give you a kick in the gut but leaves you enlightened, a feat which perhaps only 'Mulholland Drive' was able to do for me in modern cinema. David Lynch's film is one strange mix of reality and fantasy, but 'Drive' seems to operate on two separate levels, with the plot on one side and the atmosphere on the other. Perhaps, when we discuss the term 'story' 'Drive' is the perfect example.",9,1,3,27 August 2014
Garden State," Mixed feelings, with the balance tipping towards clichÃ©
","Zach Braff's light-hearted directorial debut 'Garden State' was one of mixed feelings. Although the low budget comedy-drama may be the starting shot of a successful career, 'Garden State' left me feeling slightly disappointed, when I think about the movie that could have been.Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) is a young man with a scarred past, who has numbed his problems with an always full medicine cabinet. As a kid, he paralysed his mother by pushing her over a dish washer. His father has always blamed Andrew, while he himself claims it was just due to the broken latch. He now returns to New Jersey for his mother's funeral. During his return, he develops a relationship with the spontaneous, talkative Sam (Natalie Portman).Sam is the most interesting character in the film, wherein Portman shows she is more than just a pretty face. She creates a layered character with a complicated but likable personality, whereas to my mind Braff's numbness and quirkiness is more difficult to like. Braff's directorial choices are certainly not bad for a first-timer. His style is effective in portraying the character quirks of Andrew. While a director like Kar Wai Wong often uses slow-motion shots, Braff sometimes focuses on Andrews character and speeds up everything around him. As to the film's script, there are bright moments, but unfortunately, sometimes it lapses into force-fed Hollywood romanticism.Nevertheless, I can appreciate the light-heartedness of the film and the 'Graduatesque' relationship is interesting to an extent. However, the word 'forced' lingered in my head throughout the film. Granted, it is a good soundtrack, but the emotionality of the movie seems to force itself upon us by the use and timing of the songs.",5,1,1,22 July 2014
Sherlock Holmes," Forgettable
","If you're looking for a witty, intelligent mystery film with an original plot, keep looking. Guy Richie's previous achievements with 'Snatch' and 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' gave high expectations for his turn on the brilliant detective Sherlock Holmes and his assistant Dr. Watson. However, I was all in all disappointed by the film.I'm not going to fully elaborate on the plot, but simply explained, Holmes (Robert Downey Jr) and Watson (Jude Law) seek to bring down the very evil, often irksome mysterious Lord Blackwood, portrayed by Mark Strong. Rachel McAdams plays a self-interested professional thief named Irene Adler.When I think about the plot and the characters, trite is a word which comes to mind immediately. The film would have been forgettable altogether, if it wasn't for the witty performance of Robert Downey Jr. His wittiness and humour, already his trademark as an actor, stand out against Jude Law's dry seriousness. Rachel McAdams, when not in her typical romantic role, has difficulty establishing herself and adding a certain depth to her character. Further, the plot is made to look intricate but is actually rather dull and tiring, with a relatively predictable ending. However, visually the film is sometimes quite stunning. The beautiful cinematography shows London in the late 19th century, especially the unfinished London Tower Bridge is magical.",5,3,4,1 August 2014
Goodfellas," Modern Classic
","'It was a glorious time.' Glorious doesn't begin to describe this 1990 gangster flick by Martin Scorsese, starring Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and the inevitable Robert De Niro. It quickly became a cult classic and therefore it was no coincidence that legendary film critic Roger Ebert called it the greatest mob film of all time. Goodfellas deals with the rise and downfall of half-Irish, half- Italian mobster Henry Hill. Born in an Italian-American neighborhood in Brooklyn, Henry Hill is soon intrigued by the lifestyle of the local mafia family. Henry becomes a part of the crime organization, which includes Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci). Henry enjoys the luxuries of being with the mafia for several years and finds a wife in Karen (Lorraine Bracco). He earns his living by robbing, racketeering and other criminal activities. However, eventually, the gangster life becomes too much for him and in order to avoid being imprisoned, he goes into the Witness Protection Program. He incriminates all of his former friends and is forced to give up the exciting gangster lifestyle to live the rest of his life 'like a schnook'. There are several reasons why Goodfellas can be considered a great film and a must-see . Firstly, Scorsese's movies are known for their adept use of music, and Goodfellas isn't any different. Nobody wanted to be in Morrie's (Chuck Low) shoes after Robert De Niro stared at him for 60 seconds, Cream's Sunshine of Your Love rendering the situation exceedingly frightening. Every scene is accompanied by music appropriate to the scene, as well as captivating the setting in which Goodfellas is set.Secondly, the acting performances in Goodfellas are memorable to say the least. De Niro is practically born to play a mafioso, but the most remarkable performance is perhaps that of Joe Pesci, in his portrayal of Tommy DeVito, an Italian-American gangster with a short fuse. Pesci sucks all the attention towards him in every scene, which results in a great mixture of hilarious and shocking moments. Strangely, even though he has a (psychopathic) tendency towards violence, you empathize with Tommy, which is all Pesci's credit for making him a 'family man'. The Academy thankfully rewarded him for his troubles with an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Goodfellas deals with important themes such as love, marriage, family and crime. Therefore, what makes this gangster film so enduring and interesting is the sympathetic and likable characters which the actors bring to the screen. Often, gangster movies are associated with stereotypical characters, 'tough guys' who love to 'lean on a guy' or push the proverbial 'button'. However, Marty shows us the human side of these gangsters. Therefore, this duality in the characters intensifies the shock you endure when for example Tommy suddenly violently erupts.For all the above reasons, I consider Goodfellas a must-see and modern classic like no other. Goodfellas is full of quotable and funny dialogues (funny how?) and excellent acting, making it one of the greatest movies of all time.",10,0,1,22 January 2014
