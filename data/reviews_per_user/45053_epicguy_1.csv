Requiem for a Dream," A powerful, horrifying look at the downside of drug abuse.
","This movie is about self-delusion, as seen in the context of drug abuse.
We track the experiences of four people who all have problems at the start of the film. Sara Goldfarb, portrayed in a startling performance by Ellen Burstyn, is still getting over her husband's death and longs for some meaning in her life - 'something that's worth waking up in the morning for' and finds it in the news that she is to appear on television, something she is almost as addicted to as sugar.Her son Harry, played convincingly by Jared Leto, longs constantly for a new, better fix and not surprisingly, finds it in drugs. His girlfriend Marianne (Jennifer Connelly), tries to escape from the control of her parents, who give her enough money, which for her, is not enough and so she also gets involved with the drug scene, descending to lower levels each time.Marlon Wayans plays the role of their friend, Tyrone, for whom all that seems to matter is doing something with his life that will please his mother. The fickle world of drugpushers promises wealth and status and soon starts involving him and his two friends.The film moves through three seasons. Summer sees everyone living the good life, but in the Fall section, things get out of control. In Winter, everything collapses and each character has to accept the consequences of their earlier actions.The direction of Darren Aronofsky and cinematography of Matthew Libatique brings Hubert Selby Jr's bleak world to life. Close-up shots of the drugtaking experience add to the extreme graphic nature of the film and the Fall section includes some of the most amazing direction, editing and cinematograpy you will ever see.It is impossible to watch this movie and not be affected by it. A powerful, horrifying look at the downside of drug abuse.",10,0,0,6 May 2001
