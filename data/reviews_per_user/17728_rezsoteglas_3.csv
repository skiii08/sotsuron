Captain Phillips," Great movie!
",Finally a great thriller without hollywoodian cliches. It's a fantastic movie!,10,0,2,27 February 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Disapointed
","I'm a Marvel and Spiderman fan, but this movie was actually borring. Ratings of 10 are just as wrong as the many 1's. This is an objective 6. And I'm angry that I was fooled to watch it.",6,3,9,13 April 2019
Annihilation," great science fiction movie, also a tough one
","Beautiful movie, great sci fi idea. Not recommended for people without a solid and quality sci-fi background.",9,1,3,6 April 2018
