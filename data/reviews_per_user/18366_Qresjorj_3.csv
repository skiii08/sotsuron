The Blair Witch Project," The Horror...The Horror...
","AAAAAAAarrrrrgh!  Oh my god - what was that!?!The Blair Witch Project was the funnest - creepeist - scareist damned film I've seen in a long while.  It is totally fresh - inovative - and gripping.Running in the dark - getting lost - walking in the woods while it rains....The audience was there the whole time - thrust into the adventure of survival, mystisism, crazyness and just plain FREAKY STUFF!A real wowzer - prooving that a scary ride doesn't have to cost millions of dollars to make.Filmakers at their best  :)10/10",10,1,2,27 July 1999
Pi," Wow...Uh, wow!
","Well, lets just say that this is very hard to understand at first!  I would try to explain how really cool it is...but I think you should just go out and SEE IT!  It is beyond trying to describe simple story plot.  This is a movie, (85 min) that could have lasted MANY more hours.  This is by far a movie editing masterpiece.  The grainy footage, the camera effects; lense flares, CG, and FF motion, and more, with a large dose of ambiant ~ techno music that absolutely ROCKS!  It combines the many elements of clasic style, but with a whole new contemporary feel to it!Five stars : ***** Highly recommended!",10,1,4,18 March 1999
The Matrix," Setting the STANDARD. (PERIOD)...
","Okay - This is for all who thought that Keanu could only do cheesy cyber-punk flicks....: IN YOUR FACE!!!!The Matrix has set the standard for high, kenetic energy action flicks of recent years...if not longer.  The special effects are......*thinks*.....I'm not gonna even try to name what the special effects are like.  I guess the closest that I could to is - New.  Amazing!!!Sure, I was going to the show with some REALLY high expectations -- What I got exceeded these expectation four times over!The plot:  Well, I found it a little bit rough to get in to - the beginning of the movie has you searching for a meaning - 'What is going on' you ask yourself.  But, as you quickly find out, is that this ONE question is what propels the story the majority of the time. It's okay if you don't get it at first - neither does the main character.  As the story progresses, so does your knowledge of the plot...and 'what the MATRIX is'.  It's a bit hard to describe - but then so is the effects that accompany it.The effects :  Well, I had NO idea....  I am a GREAT fan of John Woo and all of his masterpeices.  The effects of this movie is like taking Woo's fairly recent 'FACE/OFF' - the 'super high octane' gun fight scenese, and then add about five - ten more minutes to them.  Also add in a HEALTHY dosage of new effects and great (suspended cable) work and Whammo - you have one of the coolest fight scene movies ever to be viewed by the movie goer!!!Well...I guess I better stop drooing now....[ I think I'm gonna go see it again!!!  Maybe tomaro??? YES!!!]10/10 -- MUST SEE.  (PERIOD)...",10,0,0,10 April 1999
