Marie Antoinette," Dragged out mishmash
","Hard to enjoy the slow pace of this historical? (Marie had a fling?) piece. The costumes and scenery would be the saving grace of this 2 hour movie. Mixing the period piece with modern music has been done before (A knight's tale)and does not perk up the movie at all.Dunst manages to keep ones attention for awhile but 2 hours is a long time specially when the story has been told before. What were the long blackouts for? It does nothing but prolong the droning. There just was not enough to keep watching. Almost napped in the middle of it all.Very unsatisfying movie. People in the theatre wondered aloud 'Thats it?' What a waste of resources. Just like the royals squandering the French people's taxes. (There was that idea that the royals help pay for the American revolution, though.) Oh well. It was a dreary rainy day, anyway.",5,1,2,7 November 2006
