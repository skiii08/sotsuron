The Devil's Advocate," without a doubt : it's a masterpiece!
","i saw this movie 5 times and i can't get enough of it. al pacino is an amazing actor, his performance was brilliant. although keanu reeves is considered by critics one of the worst actors, in this movie he did his best. and the rest of the cast were very good too. this movie is a classic. my favourite scene was the one where al pacino was in the church, and he puts his finger in the water and the water begins to boil, and the expression on pacino's face is memorable. i also enjoyed the scene when keanu argued with pacino, in the final moments of the movie. the vizual effects were just amazing! this was one of the best movies that i ever saw, and i'm sure that i'm not the only one who thinks that!",10,4,5,30 December 2006
