First Man," Good movie with a potential spoiled by shaky camera
","This could have been a great movie about Neil Armstrong early US space program, but it would have looked similar to the multiple other movies and I strongly suspect that Oscar winning director couldn't tolerate such an affront. He probably decided to be 'original' just for the sake of it and introduced all the bad parts in the movie.All these extra close shots, bordering on the macro video, when half of the face fills whole screen from top to bottom. Constant intense shaky cam in still shots and regular room scenes. Walking a few steps after character and managing to wave camera everywhere, from empty corner to character and back. And all silence scenes, that look so 'original' compared to the usual shouts, cheering and talking in normal, not so 'original' space history movies.While operator/director managed to screw half of Earth scenes, their rocket scenes are amazing. Only minor nitpick is abruptly cut Apollo 1 scene. They could throw away a few minutes of Earth footage and instead complete A1 scene properly.Casting was mostly good and I suppose in character.This easily could have been a 9/10 movie with a more thoughtful editing and stabilized camera with normal distances in Earth scenes.",7,2,4,24 October 2018
