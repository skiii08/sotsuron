Requiem for a Dream," Too Well Done
","I know a man who, in his life, has done most drugs available. He's experienced more things done to his body outside of drugs than I will ever experience. Almost nothing surprises or phases him. Yet, every time this man watches 'Requiem for a Dream,' he becomes nearly catatonic. Despite this, the sheer power the storyline compelled him not only to see the movie nearly a dozen times, but also do half a dozen reads of the book.It's a perfect movie, honestly. Nothing is so over-the-top that the audience feels disbelief, giving the consequences immense impact. You learn to like the characters as people, possibly people you know in your own life, and then, things go downhill in unexpected ways.My girlfriend and I watched this movie together three or so years ago. Unlike many films, we didn't comment or point out any particular portion during the viewing. It hooked into our brainstems and drug us along through all 102 minutes without a quip. Then, after the credits began to roll, she sighed and said, 'Well, I feel like s***.' 'Requiem for a Dream' kills a lazy Sunday afternoon mood. However, it's true cinema which will stick to your synapses years after viewing. To this day, I still see Marion's underwater scream clear as day, and it still haunts me from time to time.It's a movie to see once in a lifetime, if you feel up to the task. If you or a loved one see it more than five times in five years, you're in my prayers.",10,0,1,13 March 2006
Saw III," Gorefest
","The twist at the ending didn't justify the amount of senseless gore throughout the film. This film was much more predictable than all of the others, and by the time you got to the end, you didn't even care because you just wanted the shards of agony to stop piercing your eyes. The first film was done just right, and the second film wasn't too bad either. After leaving this movie, I had the feeling that Saw III was just trying to compete with Hostel for gore-factor. I have a friend that was obsessed with the Saw series, and I warned her about Saw III, but she was determined to see it anyways. She left me a note on facebook later confessing that I was right, and she wishes she would've gone to the matin√©e so that it didn't cost her $8.00. Don't waste your time or money on this movie, you'll regret it if you do.",1,8,15,17 December 2006
