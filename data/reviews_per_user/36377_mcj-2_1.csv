The Blair Witch Project," Depends on the viewer
","How much a viewer likes this movie depends on his or her personal taste (duh).  If you thought Alien was far better than Aliens, chances are you'd be more inclined to like this movie.  Same with Jaws vs. all the sequels. This movie is all about suggestion.  You never SEE anything, and that lets your imagination runs wild.Another viewer characteristic that makes this movie more enjoyable is the ability to put yourself into the movie characters' situation.  That is what I think makes this the most scary movie I have ever seen.  For example, I think Alien was a great movie, but that situation will most likely never ever happen to me.  Blair Witch, though...I have been camping, and I have heard noises coming from the woods.  I know that can be spooky, even if it goes away immediately.  In those scenes where they were shining the lights on the cameras out the opening in the tent, I felt like I was right there with them, straining to find anything in the blackness.Anyway, I think this is a really great film, because it is the first one to actually scare me.  Most films that attempt to be scary end up just being funny, but not this one.Oh, and one more characteristic that it would help to have to really enjoy this movie...a strong stomach.
