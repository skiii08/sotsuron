The Blair Witch Project," Bland Witch project
","After seeing the Bland Witch Project, now I can understand why so many people ran from the cinemas screaming...they wasted $10 for nothing! This fictional documentary within a pseudo-documentary form may be the most overrated, under-financed piece of film to come down the pike in a long time. Where is the suspense? Where is the involvement? Where is the identification? The spectacle of three film-student types traipsing off cluelessly into an unfamiliar forest with a reported history of gruesome violence is just plain stupid. We know from a printed foreword that the three young film-makers are doomed, and by the time I got to know them a little I didn't much care what happened to them.",1,36,65,5 May 2011
The Fifth Element," Unbearable!
","Bruce Willis's technicolour trash heap of a film, with Milla whatsername babbling incoherently gets the worst futuristic film gong ever. Combining hokey science fiction, quasi-religious sentiments, and a garish French new wave fashion sensibility, this mess has a bad plot that just has a lot of stupid things happening very, very fast. Although this movie is literally dripping with eye-popping special effects, they're all hung on a scatterbrained plot that is incomprehensible. This overblown cosmic comic book was boring, idiotic and an over-priced sham. 'The Fifth Element' ends up being a major disappointment, not because it doesn't provide enough, but because it provides too much.",1,13,29,5 May 2011
Aquaman," DC does it right again
","After all the depressing and dark DC films lately, it's a refreshing breath of air to see a superhero film that is both inspiring and fun to watch. The film is visually spectacular, without all the drab scenery and dark lighting some previous DC films have relied on. Just like after seeing 'Wonder Woman', this film has you leaving the cinema feeling entertained, enthusiastic and hungry for more superhero ass-whooping!",7,1,3,18 December 2018
Justice League," Disappointed DC fan
","Being a DC fan all my life, this movie was something I was really waiting for. It's somewhat disappointing then when, never having read a Marvel comic in my life, I enjoyed the movie 'The Avengers' more. No doubt one of the biggest issues was the length of the movie. Everything seemed to be somewhat rushed, and not even when the Flash was on the screen. The choice of villain was poor too - Steppenwolf is hardly known by any non-DC comic book reader, which wouldn't provide a good stepping point for any new fans. But I do admit - I was secretly expecting a surprise at the end of the movie, and didn't receive one. The most obvious one I hoped for was the arrival of the Green Lantern Hal Jordan. I know I'm being a traditionalist here, but he was a member of the JL way before Cyborg was even considered. As it happened, there was no surprise.The movie started really quite well and definitely piqued my interest, particularly with the battle on Themyscira. Unfortunately by the end of the film, I left the cinema feeling flat. Aquaman and Cyborg were both bit players, and we learned nothing of their origins (nor the Flash's). And the final battle just seemed to involve a lot of hitting in a less than spectacular setting.I really wanted to love this film. Unfortunately I just liked it. The teaser for the next film looks promising, so lets hope we get the DC smack-down we're all hoping for soon.",7,4,9,16 November 2017
28 Weeks Later," Painful to watch
","'28 Weeks Later,' is a major disappointment. I liked the first film. This sequel is depressing, repetitive and pointless, and not scary at all. Rather than take the time to create compelling characters or a compelling story, this film just tries to run on fear. And with excessively jerky hand-held camera-work and fast editing you frequently lose track of the action and what's happening. Near misses, last-second saves, and people dying in distinctly ugly ways, is about all that can be considered story-wise. Every time the raging Londoners encounter their future victims, the soundtrack gets kicked up to eleven, not just with loud music and screaming, but with ear-shattering sounds like scraping metal, feedback, and anything else the sound team could find to startle you into submission. It is a thoroughly unpleasant, depressing, pointless, irritating and non-entertaining movie. Most post-apocalyptic thrillers make you wonder if humanity will survive before the film ends. This one makes you wonder how much of your own humanity will be lost before then.",1,6,8,5 May 2011
Independence Day," Independent in poor quality
","Every few years a really awesome film comes out. Unfortunately this wasn't one of them! With its hackneyed plot, feeble attempts at characterisation, and predictable finale, the second half of 'Independence Day' becomes an extremely dull and lifeless affair. This film shows the gullible public's desire for more wham bam and less plot. This big, dumb, glossy blockbuster designed for mass appeal is massively appalling. 'Independence Day' backs up the commonly-heard claim that movie success often has little to do with a good story and compelling characters and everything to do with big stars, big production values and good timing. And the President flying the aeroplane that eventually saves the day? Uh-huh.",1,6,10,5 May 2011
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," When worlds collide...
","Firstly to be fair, I did not enjoy neither Man of Steel nor The Dark Knight Rises. I found the former to be overblown and loud, and the latter to be slow and dull. This movie however seemed to put the better elements of both characters together in a fast paced, enjoyable film.The thing I enjoyed most was the contrasts between the characters. You begin to understand the two different worlds these characters come from, their different purposes, their different methods, and their differing moral compasses. Thrown into the mix is the first big screen and long awaited introduction of Wonder Woman. Fortunately she doesn't derail the other two characters, and her scenes are always a welcome change.The film is not without its faults though. There seemed to be some plot holes I haven't quite figured out, such as how Luthor figured out Superman's secret identity, or how Lois Lane seems to know where their battle was taking place. Also, I thought the introduction of The Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman was poorly done and should have been much more subtle. This scene really diverted greatly from what this film is meant to represent.Otherwise, the good definitely outweighs the bad and I would definitely recommend this to all DC fans, superhero worshippers, and those who just love a good action flick. Unlike the last Avengers movie, if you're not familiar with these characters, it can be figured out without leaving you feeling lost and scratching your head figuring out the plot.Overall, worth seeing.",8,4,10,23 March 2016
The Matrix," Take the other pill please!
","It's astonishing that so much money, talent, technical expertise and visual imagination can be put in the service of something so stupid. This overlong, high concept hokum is little more than a bloated, mechanical, and tiresome film which is big on visuals and short on story. Bland, androgynous Keanu Reeves plays a 22nd-century computer hacker who is recruited by Carrie-Anne Moss to join a band of cyber freedom fighters led by Morpheus in a struggle against the scary, menacing machines that control mankind. The result is an eye-popping, deafening and mind-numbing muddled mayhem and possibly the least humane, least responsible, least pardonable movie I have ever seen.",1,10,23,5 May 2011
Deadpool," We walked out of this movie...
","We went to this film not knowing anything about the Deadpool character, but after seeing the positive reviews this film had received, we thought we would give it a try. We had similarly known little about other Marvel characters (X-Men, Avengers), and since we had enjoyed these other films, we thought Deadpool would be a funny and entertaining experience.We didn't walk in expecting it to be anything like the former mentioned films, and we knew this was an anti-hero movie. We aren't particularly turned off by violent movies if there's a purpose to the story, but nothing prepared us for this. The constant on-screen assault we experienced was humorless, pointless, convoluted and cringeworthy.It was after half an hour of constant swearing, graphic violence, smutty innuendo and jokes about cancer before the faint hope that the film would improve disappeared and we walked out.Don't think for a second you can take your kids to this movie. It isn't anything I'd ever want my kids to see. I'm already dreading the fact that a sequel is apparently in the works. Needless to say, I wont be spending my money.",1,64,130,1 March 2016
