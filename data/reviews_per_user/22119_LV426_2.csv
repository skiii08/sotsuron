The Blair Witch Project," It's what you don't see that keeps you up at night
",This movie is perhaps the most intense I have ever seen.  It's up there with 'The Shining' as the most horrifying movie.  This movie disturbed me on so many levels.  First there was the hoax that it was real.  Very clever. Then there was the uneasy feeling that you were watching a snuff film.  Also very clever.  Lastly they didn't show you 'the thing' in the woods.  If I saw an old lady flying through the woods I would have left the theatre.  After all the human imagination is the most terrifying thing of all.  This movie won't affect you until hours later when you're in bed and the lights go out.,Null,1,1,28 August 1999
Event Horizon," A great copy-cat movie
","This is a good sc-fi thriller.  Sure it mimics such other great films of the genre.  Namely 'Alien', 'Aliens', and 'Black Hole', but it does it well enough and finds a niche all its own.  The visuals are very impressive and the acting is great.  Seeing Sam Neil working with Laurence Fishborne is wonderful.  They have a good banter between them.  The design of the ship is very creative and the design of the warp drive will send shivers down your spine.  The directing pace is very fast, and spins around a lot.  Overall it is a good movie with some unique scares.  Sure the comparisons between this and other movies of the genre are there, but, this movie gives you enough new stuff to balance it out.  At least a must rental.",Null,0,0,7 October 1999
