The Equalizer," don't believe some of these review ..movie is amazing
","Can't believe some of the reviews I have read about this movie ..The movie is attention grabbing from beginning to end ...if you don't like this movie it's based on your own outside judgement issues not the movie..great story line, great acting, great camera work,..go bad mouth something else because there is not room for your bull here..ChrisThis movie is a little slow at the start but builds up quickly..the anticipation of knowing what he did before his new life is crazy..Denzel is amazing at what he does and was put to good use in this movie..the camera work on the main scenes where exhilarating. They could of ended this movie in the Home Mart ..but nope, Set up get ready for a ride..because your in for treat watching this for the first time ..",10,1,4,5 January 2015
