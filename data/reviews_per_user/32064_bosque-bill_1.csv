10 Cloverfield Lane," Went from 9 to 3 in the final 10 minutes
","SPOILER ALERT. An hour and a half of 9 stars wiped out in the final 10 minutes. A ridiculous ending with no payout except to encourage the psychotics and survivalists out there. Instead of the hokey sci-fi ending, it would have been fun to see the protagonist climb up on the truck and look over the cornfields toward noises she hears faintly in the distance. What would she see in this alternative ending? She would see a lot of lights and discover the noise was music from a carnival. All would be well and all would have been well with the world. The shelter would have been the work of a psychotic. Instead, we get an easy, pat, and popular answer to the mystery...an answer that is far from satisfying. A very good story, well acted UNTIL the disappointing end.",3,0,2,17 April 2016
