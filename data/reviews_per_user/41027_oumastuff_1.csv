The Monuments Men," Well I liked it!
","Regardless how the other reviewers seem to feel...again affirming my opinion that the human race is indeed dumber than most mammals on earth...I found the film very enjoyable. It was light-hearted and witty enough to attract an audience, wider than the usual WWII 'enthusiasts' but poignant enough to still get its message across and not completely negate the severity of what happened. This year already had The book thief to 'beat the dead horse' (so to speak), and I for one was delighted that Hollywood took the time to tell a different story of the war (that didn't involve a Marvel character)! Art, Architecture, Literature- these are the things that define not only people but era's, these are the things that outlive 'victors of war'. Appreciate the movie for what it is- a delightful introduction for a book today's generation that may never even have considered picking up to read in the first place!",9,1,2,10 April 2014
