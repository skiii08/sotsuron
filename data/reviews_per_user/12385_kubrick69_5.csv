E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," this movie belongs to no one but Steven Spielberg
","meaning he can make any damn changes he wants to the film.  You don't like it?  Fine, watch the original.  All the changes really don't add up to much, most people would not even notice the guns missing if it hadn't been pointed out to them.  And the 'penis breath' line WILL be in the rerelease.  I will see this again in theaters and it deserves whatever money it makes.",Null,0,0,19 March 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," It's the one thing a Star Wars movie shouldn't be: unmemorable
","Yeah, it's got special effects.  Lots of special effects.  Some are done better than others.  Some of the CGI characters are about as convincing as Roger Rabbit.  Some of the action sequences are extraordinary.There is not a single line of memorable dialogue.  Not one.  The romance between Anakin and Padme is clunky and ridiculous.  The dialogue is bad. Bad, bad or just bad, bad, bad?  Both.Ewan McGregor rocks.  Unfortunately, he is given very little too do but he stills has the best sequence of the movie, as Obi-wan investigates the creation of the clone army on that rainy planet.  In other news, Count Dooku is an okay villain but he's no Saruman.  Not by a long shot.Yoda- I preferred the puppet to the CGI version.  I was looking forwarding to his battle with Dooku but unfortunately what I imagined in my head was better than what I saw on screen.  Yoda moved liked a pinball, not very interesting.  And pretty goofy at that.The plot?  Don't ask.  Overall, a (slight) improvement on Episode I, but mostly clunky action, clunky acting (Hayden is no great thespian), and clunky dialogue make this a very unmemorable film.  Approximate running time: 4 days.",4,0,0,17 May 2002
Gone with the Wind," Surprisingly, a great film
","I never really wanted to see 'Gone With The Wind'- being a guy, four hour Civil War soap operas are not on my must-see list.  Yet when I finally sat down to watch it, I was overwhelmed by the sheer scope of events and emotion.  It is truly amazing that the film maintains interest for its entire running time.  The production-design and cinematography knocked me off my feet.Some people have accused this movie of being racist but that is highly inaccurate.  The movie totally ignores the issue of slavery but that doesn't make it racist.  What's more, Mammy (Hattie MacDaniel, who won as Oscar for this role) constantly tells Scarlett to stop acting like 'poor white trash'. How great is that?",Null,1,1,18 March 2002
Groundhog Day," One of the best movies ever made
","Yes it's true, this is no mere star vehicle for Bill Murray.  It's a truly ingenius, inventive, funny, and touching comedy-fantasy.  There is so much to love.  Director/co-writer places brilliant touches throughout, particularly in never explaining what causes Phil's time-warp.  It doesn't even really seem to have a purpose at all and the way Phil eventually manipulates his situation and then comes to use it to better himself is so wonderful and organic that it makes this movie practically the best 'feel-good' movie since the days of Frank Capra.  And it doesn't even seem sappy!!! Plus there is no shortage of humor- Bill Murray is at the top of his game and Andie MacDowell makes an ideal romantic companion.  Even Chris Elliot (who has been terrible in movies lately) seems funny.This movie is a modern classic and its stature and memory will outlive that of movies like 'A Beautiful Mind' or 'American Beauty' (two movies you should avoid at all costs).  Among films made in the 1990s, this easily ranks in the top ten and surely among the top 100 of all time.  A must see.",Null,0,1,6 April 2002
Vanilla Sky," Who knew Cameron Crowe could make such a terrible movie?
","While watching 'Vanilla Sky', you get the sense that you are seeing the efforts of a man who is trying his best but quite frankly, has no damn idea what he is doing.  There is no flow, and the wierdness just piles up without any resonance or 'holy shit'-can't believe I saw that! quality----it's amazing how boring most of the movie is.  So basically, we have an overlong movie about a man (Cruise's worst performance to date) whose reality becomes more warped and his life unravels only to have it all explained with the GOOFIEST damn ending anyone has ever seen.  It is hard not to simply shake your head in disbelief that you are actually watching a movie THIS bad. The only saving grace of this movie is Kurt Russell's best performance and perhaps John Toll's ethereal cinematography.",1,1,5,17 December 2001
