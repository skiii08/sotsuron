Hereditary," I wish I could give a negative score
","Went in with fairly high hopes - my first mistake. I ended up sitting through the worst smelling pile of disappointment in a while. Not at all scary, the film felt disjointed and in the end I was left feeling sorry for the talented actors that took part in this. Recommend passing on this and looking elsewhere. No spoilers here, just a spoiled movie night with friends who were hoping for a decent thriller.",1,1,6,16 September 2018
