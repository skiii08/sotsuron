Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," George Lucas- for someone whose creativity is often sited, he sure does repeat himself a lot.
","I don't want to go into the details for those who haven't seen it, but if you had trouble with repetitions earlier in the series this film will drive you crazy.Also, I don't think the issue here should be where this film falls in quality of previous Star Wars films (we're adults now our film history is hopefully a little bigger) but how it stands against greater cinematic myths like '2001' or 'High Noon'. Nor should it be getting excited about our childhood past- are you really dying for Disney's 'The Black Hole II'? Of course maybe it's just about having fun, which I'd respond- switch lines to 'The Matrix' immediately.Sorry, I wanted to like it.One warning- Jar Jar Binks talks like Donald Duck the entire movie. Be prepared. Be very prepared.",3,0,1,20 May 1999
