Despicable Me 2," It Killed 2 Hours
","How is this one the highest grossing animated films of all time? Why does it have a 7.6 on IMDb? What's so universal about dumb, whacky yellow henchman to the human psyche? Despicable Me is so average, even when compared to the original, which at least tried.Despicable Me was about a misunderstood evil villain, and his misadventures as a single father. Despicable Me 2 doesn't have themes beyond its adventure. Side characters from the original are missing or reduced to cameos. Gru is no longer a villain. His single father issues are trite. The lone development in this film is Gru's romantic relationship. Its typically cartoonish, with little romantic chemistry.At least the movie is funny. The characters are outrageous and often engage in slapstick. If you like what you've seen of the minions, you'll probably like the film's humor.Its a decent rental, if you're just looking for laughs. You don't need to watch the first.",5,1,1,15 August 2014
Vertigo," The Most Overrated Film of All Time
","Sure, not every film on IMDb's Top 250 is going to stagger me. But at least I can see why those films are respected. Vertigo offers nothing beyond its historical importance. If this film were released today, nobody would care. Instead of being a classic that transcends time, its one of the most dated movies I've seen.The acting and character are as stock as any movie from the era. Nothing separates our lead beyond his paranoia. Worse yet is the romantic relationship between James Stewart and Kim Novak. Cinema snobs love to bash Hollywood blockbusters for their contrived romances, but pretend films like Vertigo are somehow better. They know each other for a day, yet we're supposed to believe Stewart has a romantic obsession after her death? Give me a break. Their passion is as brilliant as a wet paper bag.Vertigo is supposed to be a great psychological thriller. I found myself bored. I can't care about the characters when their relationship is so contrived. And nothing impressed me in terms of audio, cinematography, or plot twists. When Kim Novak is killed in the last minute of the film, me and my friend were laughing - because we didn't care about the character, and had no time to witness anyone's sorrow. It had no point in the narrative. And as the ending to the film, it gave me nothing to take away from it.And I'm not someone who only likes films made after a certain date. But legitimately good films remain relevant decades after their release. The Great Dictator, 12 Angry Men, and The Godfather all hold up. I don't see any of that quality in Vertigo. Some may cite how it was shot, or how it influenced films for years to come, but as a 21st century viewer, Vertigo fails to illicit any emotion. My mind is sufficiently intact.",2,56,93,31 July 2014
Akira," Easily The Worst Anime I've Ever Seen
","This was the game changer? Really? Wow. I can't believe that a movie with such poor writing is considered one of the all-time greats, the anime that brought the medium to The West. Its 2 hours long, but its worse than Genocyber in terms of character development and explanation. I felt helpless as the plot unfolded, each point more out-of-damn-nowhere than the last. Things only happen because Akira wants them to. Who cares about logic? As if there's a reward for interpreting the cryptic writing. These characters are awful. Most of the cast has no personality beyond their role: 'biker', 'colonel', 'scientist', or 'politician'. The two lone exceptions are Tetsuo and Kaneda. Tetsuo apparently has a huge inferiority complex that makes him homicidal immediately after getting his powers. We barely see him struggle, but we hear him b!?$% about it throughout. Kaneda is just a dumbass. Rude, violent, and annoying, without any backstory. Instead of creating a strong relationship between these two, all we get is bike chase scenes and yelling the other's name.The saddest part is, honestly, the animation is among the best out there. The level of detail on such a grandiose city is astounding. The animation is smooth, and it overall conveys the dark tone. The weird moans and yells of the soundtrack also strangely work out. Too bad its wasted! This is one of the worst written films I've seen. Akira cares far more about fast bikes and bloody deaths than character development. Not one character resonated with me, and the ass-pull ending was emotional anti-matter. I hate this movie.",2,9,21,9 October 2014
The Great Dictator," Slapstick With Drama And Political Commentary!
","The Great Dictator is famous for its final speech. Dubbed by many as 'The Greatest Speech Ever Made', Charlie Chaplin puts all his soul into his defense of liberty and human progress. Indeed, I've never heard any speech feel so passionate, yet so genuine. If you don't watch this film, you should at least listen to that. Its easy to find on YouTube.As for the rest of the film? It depends on how much you like physical comedy. Its strength doesn't lie in writing or character, but their performances. Many scenes emphasize the actor's movements and reactions. The parodies of Hitler and Mussolini often speak in foreign gibberish. Its a style common back then, but rare now, so its pretty niche. I thought it was okay - a few scenes made me chuckle, and no joke completely failed. It could have been 30 minutes shorter.I wouldn't watch this film for its satire of fascism alone. There are some good lines and scenes, but it generally lacks depth. Its far from my favorite comedy of all time, but that's personal taste. I also respect it for having more ambition and empathy for humanity than most movies back then, let alone comedies. And of course, the ending alone guarantees a respectable rating. Watch the film if you're a fan of Charlie Chaplin or The Three Stooges, and watch the final scene regardless of your opinions.",8,1,2,31 July 2014
Troy," A Great Adaptation of Iliad
","Some say they Hollywooded Homer's epic. I think it was all to the benefit of the film. There are no Gods or miracles, romance is emphasized, and important plot-points have changed. But it all felt appropriate. Better for our heroes to be romantic than rapists. It would have been near impossible to include the Gods and keep the serious tone, so I'm glad they're only mentioned.It does a good job at keeping to the themes of the original story. Neither side is totally vilified, each with sympathetic characters. The toll of war and the vice of pride are still powerful subjects after 2700 years.Troy uses its high budget better than most films. No wonder - since it cost $175 million to make! The battles are vast, and every person and background matches the period. If we never have another Iliad film, its because they can't outdo this film's scope.Troy is a good action blockbuster, but also has more character and emotion than most. It deserves its $500 million gross...and annual showings in high schools across the country.",8,1,2,25 July 2014
Alien," The Best of Both Worlds. But...
","There's a lot to love about Ridley Scott's Alien. Its a great sci-fi film. Its a great horror movie. And its effects are legendary. The ships, both human and alien, look amazing. The Nostromo looks like a real space vessel, and the mysterious wreckage is bizarre and haunting. H.R. Giger's vision of 'biomechanical' adds a style rarely replicated in film. Only he could create such a terrifying creature. Seriously, the xenomorphs are among the scariest monsters ever filmed. They're not your typical greens or grays....I just wish the characters were stronger. I didn't connect with any member of the cast. Not even Ripley. I couldn't get beyond their occupation, or role in the story. This is a big problem when the movie's pace is slow. Since I already knew a lot of the plot points, the suspense sometimes felt boring. It doesn't need a lot of development, but some more personality would have gone a long way. Also, ultimately, the plot is a typical slasher/creature feature. Its one of the best, sure. Its still predictable.While I don't think its the best movie of any genre, I enjoyed it, and defiantly respect its ambition. If you haven't watched it yet, its pretty good. And if you don't know the details, you're in for some shocking surprises~",7,0,2,29 August 2014
Interstellar," This Better Be a Classic
","It is rare for me to be truly amazed at what's on the big screen. Impressed? Sure. Blow away? Almost never. But Interstellar was exactly what you wanted in a space odyssey film and more. Realistic, well-shot, detailed, atmospheric. It transcends the typical sci-fi action blockbuster, captivating with its sheer scope and mystery.And Interstellar has what many other ambitious sci-fi films lack - human drama. Interstellar has actual, likable characters on screen instead of one-dimensional tools to move the plot.There are numerous problems. The early exposition dialog is obvious. It was difficult to here people sometimes. There are some hammy moments, or failed attempts at insight. And your mileage on the ending may vary. But sometimes, you just can't nitpick every little thing about a movie, wishing it was tailor-made to suit you. Overall, I thought it was a great, beautiful sci-fi film. Watch it in the theaters while you still can!",8,0,3,21 December 2014
Pacific Rim," One of The First Good Giant Monster Movies of 21st Century Film
","I think some people took Pacific Rim too seriously. Yeah, there was a lot of hype surrounding it, but you can't really expect an epic, revolutionary storyline from a high budget Power Rangers movie. And as such, it does a good job, where Godzilla 1998 and the Transformers franchise failed. The Host and Cloverfield came closer, but weren't grandiose enough. King Kong did a great job, but that was almost a decade ago. Pacific Rim puts its enormous budget to good use, with some great special effects and vicious fights.The characters are pretty flat, though. Most can be described in one word, and some barely have lines. Charlie Day is liked by some, by I found him to be annoying, leeching time from the screen with his subplot. The two leads were likable, and Idris Elba is as boss as ever. But there should be more, considering the length of time you spend with them.Its made up by the action, IMHO. Titanic robots vs gigantic monsters has never been done better. The CGI is very good, the robots have cool designs, and each individual monster has a unique body type. Both sides are evenly matched, and you do get a sense of increasing danger as the Kaiju become larger, more intelligent, and specialized. There's hardly an easy battle, as Jaegers get smashed, Kaiju sliced and incinerated. The sheer scale is rarely matched in blockbusters, and the camera is calm enough to let it sink in.Oh yeah - the main theme is one of the most heroic themes of all time, despite the Inception horn.Its not exactly intelligent, but as a fan of mecha and monsters, Pacific Rim does so well what so few are doing that I couldn't help but enjoy myself. If you like the idea and hold your expectations right, its a perfectly good popcorn film. Its shallow, but its not like they could do much more with the concept. Let's just hope the series and sequel take things up a few notches!",7,0,1,22 July 2014
The Thing," You Don't Have to Be a Horror Fan to Love The Thing
","This review will remain vague. In fact, I think the IMDb description is too much. You should go in as blind as possible.The Thing is one of the few horror films I've liked, let alone loved. First of all, few have such a mysterious, creepy atmosphere. You are given plenty of time to let the situation settle, ponder the mysteries with the characters, and question everything that comes across the screen. You're further isolated by the cold, inhospitable environment of Antarctica. Nothing feels right, so you're always on the edge of your seat.Character is much better than in most horror films. None of them are useless, annoying cannon fodder. They act how you and I would act to the situation. Each has their own traits, occupation, and moments in the film. You don't want to see any of them die. MacReady is a good action lead - cocky, but takes things seriously. He also has a cool beard. The characters aren't fleshed-out, but its impressive for a horror film with a large cast.The effects are considered among the best in practicals ever made. You'll need to see that for yourself.The Thing is the perfect horror film that deserves its resurgence. It doesn't treat the audience like teenage idiots, and few can match its constant tone. You will not see me rate a horror film higher than this!",9,1,3,25 July 2014
Shrek Forever After," The Definitive Example of Sequalitis
","Shrek was a giant hit back in 2001, pleasing kids and adults with its parody of fairy tales. It had great 3D animation for the time and even had a little heart. Shrek 2 is one of the few animated sequels to be better than the first, actually developing the characters instead of simplifying them. It has funnier jokes, a larger scope, and genuine suspense.Me, my sister, and my mother went to both Shrek 3 and 4 in the theater. For a long time, Shrek 2 was one of our favorite family movies. Even 7 years ago, we realized that Shrek 3 was a clunker. We fooled ourselves into seeing Shrek 4, but alas, the series was essentially dead.The best part about the first two films were the character's relationships. They defied expectations, and somehow made the grouchy Shrek and annoying Donkey funny and lovable. You get to see some buildup in Shrek and Fiona's relationship, as well as their personal conflicts and tension with Fiona's royal family. Shrek 3 dropped the ball on the humor and character development, and Shrek 4 certainly didn't catch it.By being a time travel movie, all the development in the previous films is essentially thrown away. Shrek no longer has a personal problem to overcome. His biggest transgression is wishing for a day's vacation. That's it. If it weren't for the villain, his life would be fine and he'd be a well-balanced ogre.Its just an adventure movie that isn't particularly fascinating, and not even that funny. Most ironically, Shrek and Fiona's relationship has become the very thing the original was satirizing. 'True love' isn't built in this film - its simply there, awakened if you play the role of fireman and save your lover's life. In the original, Fiona was shocked that her knight in shining armor was an ogre. They have to spend time together on their journey back to realize their true feelings. In Shrek 2, the Prince Charming is a spoiled, selfish brat, who only wants love to satisfy his own needs. Our lovers get into a big argument, but ultimately show they're willing to make sacrifices for the other's happiness, and make amends. Shrek 4 has none of this depth or awareness, and forgets that love by heroism only exists in fairy tales.Considering the wealth of options out there, there is no reason for you to see Shrek 4. It fails to capture the magic of the first two films, and is overshadowed by dozens of even mediocre animated movies. How the mighty have fallen...",4,0,1,6 August 2014
Aliens," Good, But Needs To Be Taken Down A Few Pegs
","Alien was a suspenseful, sci-fi horror film. Aliens decided to add more aliens and abandon most of the suspense and horror in exchange for action. That'd be fine, if it weren't so meat-headed.The first major problem is the film uses a large number of people as cannon fodder, nothing else. Nothing is more infuriating than when an action film has absolutely no respect for human life. These mercenaries are annoying jock stereotypes whose death has zero effect on me. Seriously, these wastes of space have no wonder or fear over monstrous aliens? Nuts to that. Those scenes sucked.The other issue is how the action is shot. Normally, cinematography is not something I pay attention to. Its like controls in video games - its just assumed you can shoot stuff right. Maybe some rare talent can create something impressive. But its impossible to ignore how jumpy the camera gets when the action picks up. Gunfire, CUT, alien screams, CUT, guy fires again, CUT, guy gets bitten, CUT, show his face, CUT, back to his arm. Jesus Christ, calm down! You don't need to hide these special effects! Once the mercenaries are decimated, and the camera decides to act normal, it gets better. Once again, the setting and effects are great. You truly believe we are on some different planet. And the aliens are as intimidating as ever, although some of their majesty is lost since they're killed so often. And the ending is pretty awesome. The characterization has improved, too. It could have been better, but I had a greater idea on who Ripley was. I'm iffy on Newt - she doesn't add much to the story, but she does provide a contrast between Ripley and Newt and the xenomorphs.Aliens is far from a perfect action film. Even ignoring higher standards for art, some scenes destroy their own suspense. Sure, its pretty good. IMDb Top 250? I don't think so.",6,2,4,30 August 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," The First Superhero Movie I Liked In a Long Time
","I'm not a fan of superhero comic books, but I'm not against the idea of superhero movies. Its just that few of them escape the clichés of the hundreds of other actions films out there. The Dark Knight was pretty good half a decade ago (tarnished by edgy teenage misanthropes, but that's not TDK's fault), but since then Marvel and DC either didn't interest me or disappointed. I was mildly interested in seeing this due to its high Rotten Tomatoes score, so I chose this for a movie outing with a friend.It was actually a perfectly solid action flick. I wouldn't say it sets a new bar, but it avoided clichés by focusing on character. In fact, action and character development were evenly matched.The conflict between Professor X and Magneto is done surprisingly well. You wouldn't think a superhero movie would do a good job at showing the clashing sides of moderate vs extremist activism, yet both sides are portrayed realistically. Magneto is villainous, of course, but he's not evil for the sake of evil. Professor X believes that humans can be taught to accept Mutants, yet all their crimes make Magneto convinced only one race should reign on Earth. And its not easy to debunk him. Mystique was also well done, not subservient to either side.There was too much gristle in terms of the number of superheros. Professor X, Magneto, and Mystique are the only vital characters to the plot. Wolverine, Beast, and Kitty Pride serve important roles, but don't have a character arc. Perhaps twice as many characters make cameos, but ultimately are forgettable unless you read the comics. The action never wowed me, personally. Some of parts against the Sentinels were cool, but predictable.Regardless, the characters were strong enough to hold the movie for me. A 7/10 may not seem like much, but its above average. I think it deserves its large box office toll, and I'm curious if the sequel can maintain this quality.",7,1,1,21 July 2014
District 9," An Unchallenging, Simplified View of Racism Leaves Much to Be Desired
","After I watched District 9, if you told me that it was considered a decent, lesser-known sci-fi action film, I'd be moderately impressed. The setting of the South African ghettos is unique for this genre and well-executed, and the CGI is quite good for the time and budget. But I can't disagree more with those claiming its one of the best sci-fi films of all time. To say it is an accurate allegory of human racism is like saying Salon Kitty exposes the flaws of the Nazi regime.Prejudice does not grow on trees. People don't hate everyone that's different from them. There are centuries of cultural evolution and conflict behind people's perceptions. While some people see other races and ethnicities as dumb or savage, they rarely treat everyone with disdain. For example, a white person who hates 'ghetto' culture may find the work-ethic of East Asian nations admirable. Its a complex, important topic that needs to be addressed to break the barriers between us, yet District 9 contributes nothing to the conversation but villainous stereotypes.As far as I know, the Prawns have done nothing to even agitate the human race. Yet the South African government, completely unimpressed by the appearance of intelligent life from a distant galaxy, does not show a shred of humanity. They send the Prawns to ghettos, kill them in weapons tests, and even abort their unborn without a second thought. They are just as bad as the Nazis, but without centuries of prejudice to support their actions. Yet barely any time is devoted to explaining this xenophobia. The government is evil for the sake of being evil, and is thus unrelatable to prejudices seen today.Just because the film brings up racism in a new context does not mean it should get a participation trophy. Its ultimately as safe as an episode of Sesame Street, allowing its audience to pat themselves on the back, never thinking of their own prejudices. Nor would they think in Neill Blomkamp's next film, Elysium - a practical remake of District 9 with changed nouns, discussing economic division only deep enough for it to be a plot point. The 10% of the world could pat themselves on the back, knowing that, no matter how greedy they can be, at least they're not the 1%! I suppose it can still hold up as an action film to some degree. But when all the praise seems so misplaced, its hard to ignore the bad world building and stock, two-dimensional characters. Its an alright popcorn flick, but even among action films, you can find many with better plots and characters. I personally wouldn't even recommend it to sci-fi fans, who usually seek films with intelligent writing, not a generic action movie with a sci-fi coat of paint. A lot apparently liked District 9, but I feel that's settling when we deserve much more depth than black-and-white, good-vs-evil.",4,1,3,19 July 2014
The Little Mermaid," Shallow, But Ultimately Fun and Innocent
","Y'know, Ursula is a complete evil (w)itch, but she does raise a good point. She says men don't care about what women say, and love a silent, submissive lover. You'd think that the words of our villianess are lies, a warped view of this reality...but then Prince Eric falls for the silent Ariel in less than a day.I mean, yeah, I shouldn't expect the finest writing in Disney films, but they barely tried here. While I do commend Prince Eric giving up his quest to find his mermaid in shining armor, its not like his 'other option' was any better. I can kind of forgive making them fall in love over a short time frame, but there's not a semblance of a conversation between the two. And the movie itself reminds you of this! Both parties are guilty of the 'love at first sight' myth.Alright, alright. The Little Mermaid didn't revolutionize the princess genre. Its meant for the family, especially young girls. By those standards? I did enjoy the movie! xD Its a landmark for Disney, and animation in general. It looks great for its time, has personality to its characters, and has a wonderful environment - the deep blue sea, and all the creatures that inhabit it. It also has some of the catchiest, most memorable tunes in Disney.If you're looking to catch up on some nostalgia, or want something for the whole family, it still holds up. If you want to rewatch Disney films with a more mature mind, you're not going to find much here though.",6,2,5,15 September 2014
Frozen," Disney's Animation is Getting Back on Track
","Seeing this near opening day, I had no idea Frozen would explode to be the #1 highest grossing animated film of all time. Like others, I was left disappointed by the trailers, and had 'cold' expectations.Turns out, it was a pretty good movie. Not the best animated film of all time, but I have no issue with its popularity.In a sense, it is yet another deconstruction of the 'princess' movie, like 'The Princess and the Frog', 'Tangled' and 'Brave' before it. I'd complain, but the princess Disney films were always the worst ones. More importantly, the film also focuses on sibling relationships, Elsa's powers symbolic for severe introversion. The characters are cute, likable, and more complex than the typical 3D fare. The animation was among the best of 2013, especially for me, who finds something romantic about nighttime snowscapes.There are problems, but most of it can be chalked up to the fact it is a family film. The characters could have been deeper and the musical numbers better, but they're not meant for an adult audience. Even the snowman, while unnecessary, was tolerable, and made my theater explode in giggles. And who am I to argue against the laughter of children? :PDisney had a weak decade in the 00s, with giant bombs that sealed western traditional animation's fate and forgettable 3D titles. If it weren't for Pixar, they'd be worse than Dreamworks. But their latest works have been steps in the right direction. Frozen will likely go down as much of an animated classic as The Lion King or Beauty and the Beast. But whenever or not we entered the next Disney Renaissance remains to be seen.P.S. - 'Let it Go' and the scene that accompanies it are amazing~",7,4,9,30 July 2014
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," An Early Classic - Has It Aged Well?
","Although it was Miyazaki's first original feature, I watched Nausicaä after four other films of his. Its also the first - and last - one I watched with my dad. 'What was that sh@!?' He grumbled. :P Back then, I thought it was his weakest film. I still do now, but I have more respect for it. Its the simplest in terms of plot and character and has the 'worst' animation - but it was earlier in his career. And when compared to the typical film, it still has more beauty and soul.Like most Ghibli films, Nausicaä goes great lengths to develop an original world. Its a mixture of fantasy and sci-fi, medieval and industrial. The forests are particularly unique - almost alien, with fungus-like plants and strange, giant insects. Combined with a likable lead, a serious story, and an orchestral/electronic soundtrack, it must have been quite the surprise three decades ago...too bad they butchered the English release.My biggest problem is that the story is a bit too ham-fisted. Nausicaä is more or less a perfect hero. The pro-environment, anti-war message is obvious and pretty simple. Nausicaä won't win any converts, and my eyes were fairly dry. Princess Mononoke is a very similar film, but is an improvement in almost every aspect.Its still fine, though. It you like the aesthetic or just want a fantasy adventure, its a good choice. And like most of Miyazaki's films, its great for children. It treats them as intelligent human beings, and it might go down as one of their favorites. You don't need to feed them blockbuster goofs every movie night for them to be happy. Make some memories~ :P",7,1,3,3 August 2014
Children of Men," I Don't Get It
","Why is this movie so loved? Do people not give a crap about character? This is one of the few films that was so unengaging, my entire group agreed to quit before we got halfway through. You can say we 'lost hope' that it would be good at anything.The premise has one of the laziest executions I've seen in sci-fi. The entire human race has become infertile. Why? Because of a virus? Chemicals in our water? Divine intervention? Never explained. Its a mystery to the human race, and not a single line points to a possible answer. Nor is there any reason given to the lone exception. Nor do we understand why the world has gone to Hell because of this issue. Why should we believe that, without a next generation, all nations but Nazi Britain will break apart? The film doesn't provide answers there, either. Even bad sci-fi films at least try. Off the top of my head, this is the worst sci-fi film in terms of world building, which made it difficult to get immersed.Equally bad is its characters. They're so drab in personality, I'd struggle to call them stock. Not a single one was interesting, and I couldn't care about any of their fates. Combined with a bare-bones setting, none of the themes take off for me.I never finished this film. But after reading the plot synopsis, I'm glad I didn't. It just changes from a dull dystopia film to a dull action film. I've seen clips from these scenes - and while they are well-shot, they mean nothing without context. Both sides turn out to be bad, but why should I care? Neither side interested me in the first place.Some people may like this. But you won't be hearing recommendations from me.",2,6,8,8 August 2014
Big Hero 6," Cute, Pretty, Action-Packed, and Funny
","Some may say Big Hero 6 doesn't revolutionize the superhero genre. While that may be true, it does the job much better than most superhero movies I've seen. There is quite a lot to love about this movie. The voice acting is spot-on, the animation is bright and defined, and there are some great jokes. I loved how they took a good portion of the film to set things up. I loved the villain's appearance, how he mostly stayed silent, only using motions of his body. And who doesn't love the mechanical marshmallow Baymax?The first scenes had some bad exposition dialog, but what really prevents me from loving the movie are the side characters. These heroes had little to do with the plot and had no development. The two dudes were very annoying, the least funny aspects of the movie. I wanted more characterization with the villain, but tbh, he's fine.Its a very solid movie, that I think both adults and kids will enjoy. I'm glad Disney is keeping quality up, and trying different things. Go ahead and see it in the theater.",7,9,29,8 November 2014
Mulholland Drive," Just Because You Can Be Original, Doesn't Mean You Should Be
","If it weren't for Mulholland Dr.'s gimmicks, I don't think many would like it. The characters are flat, boring, and undefined. Its supposed to be a tragic tale, but I barely know anything about our main, so I'm not too concerned she shot herself. But Mulholland Dr amuses people because of its unique progression, its dream-like tone, and its mystery begging to be solved. But what's our reward for solving the puzzle? Although Lynch's style makes everything open to interpretation, the majority of the film doesn't seem to have any importance to the universe's reality. Its a vision of what could have been, almost a satire of television shows. But it turns out the reality for our main character is far darker. So we spent most of the movie being fed a lie, the reality obfuscated for whatever reason. Even in the few minutes we are closer to the truth, the strange characters and events persist. While intriguing and unsettling, it made me feel like I was viewing Betty from the wrong end of binoculars. And no matter how good your film is acted, written, shot, or produced, without a solid cast, let alone a lead, I'm unimpressed.Angry art snobs, desperate to defend their worshiped pieces, will complain that viewers want their messages on a silver platter. But they are too far up on their high horses to realize that artistic opinion is subjective, and if everything is art, than nothing is art. Not everything acclaimed needs to be respected by everyone. As a criticism of Hollywood, so much is lost to the bizarre structure. As a mystery, there is little reason for me to solve a puzzle where the pieces aren't even defined. Its a distraction, with a few good moments, but at the end of the day, this film didn't stick with me.",4,0,4,17 August 2014
Brave," Bear-ly Average
","Scroll back two years ago - I was excited to see Brave. Toy Story 3 was fine, but it was hanging in old ground. I didn't even think of going to Cars 2. Brave looked fresh, an epic fantasy adventure from a big budget, yet highly respected studio.Saw it with the family. Came out with all four of us underwhelmed.One of Pixar's defining trademarks is its unique ideas. They can create fantastic worlds, and use plots barely explored before. You're not going to find another movie about an old man and his floating house on a quest to save a rare bird from another old man and his dogs, just for a boy's approval. Brave...is just another princess deconstruction, set in a pretty plain Scotland. There's bears, I suppose.I know that its a family movie, but the plot was so predictable, there's little suspense. Especially the ending. Jeez. I didn't love any of the characters, and its theme doesn't seem necessary today. Heck, when it comes to movies straying from princess stereotypes, Disney already produced two better films not 3 years before Brave: The Princess and the Frog and Tangled.Nothing about the film was terrible. And the animation was pretty good, although it didn't have much to do beyond the main's hair. But in terms of plot, character, and writing, nothing amazed me, or even stood out. And its more than just my tastes, as many others share similar feelings.Its skip-able. If you are going to see it, the worse thing you can do is go in with high expectations.",5,1,2,9 August 2014
2001: A Space Odyssey," Like Space - Beautiful, Mysterious, Empty
","I have a love-hate relationship with 2001. Seeing it two years ago for a Film 101 class, it was the only one I enjoyed in a semester with the worst films I've ever seen. It was realistic, detailed, a journey into the great unknown. And of course, it was revolutionary for its time. Before then, sci-fi was cheesy pseudo-horror, now only remembered on MS3TK (barring a few exceptions). 2001 was serious, firmly grounded in reality, and ambitious. Its done so well that you could mistake it for a 90s film. Few movies are that timeless. And despite 40 years, I'd say it still holds up. I can't say that for many sci-fi 'staples' like Blade Runner, Akira, Ghost in the Shell, and The Matrix.However...in terms of writing, it really only is a very well done space adventure. I struggle to see how one could get more out of it. Stanley Kubrick rarely gives his films depth. They may be about interesting, important topics, but they do little beyond making the statement.The film is about evolution, yes. That's literally what's going on. Ancient proto-humans learn to use tools, our tools become spaceships, and Dave evolves into a 'star child'. You could watch 2001 muted and realize this fact. But how is this reflected in the writing? What else mirrors our evolution, emphasizes the traits that separate us from beasts?As far as I can tell, nothing.The film has little conversation despite its 160 minute length. Many can't stand the film because its so slow. I can't blame them. There is no insight, empathy, or development. If you aren't fascinated by the visuals, the film is hollow.Dave is not the protagonist the film needs. He's such an everyman that he becomes a no-man. He is nothing beyond his occupation. He may evolve, literally, but his emotions have flat-lined. The film could have shown us the power of humanity with his conflict against HAL. HAL may have power and wisdom, but his computer mind is cold and linear. Dave could have used our unique human ingenuity to defeat him, showing how our species have overcome such staggering odds...but no. HAL causes chaos, but is defeated simply. No tricks or negotiation are used. HAL is just slowly unplugged. He ultimately serves no purpose to the theme of evolution - you can argue he represents nature or even God, but how he's overcome evokes nothing.Honestly, my personal dislike of Stanley Kubrick and his rapid fans probably unjustly effected the rating. Still, although I really enjoyed 2001 the first time, I'm not sure if I could ever watch it again. Its so long, with no character to experience or analyze. I could give a really high recommendation to the types of people who enjoy style over subsistence. Only a handful of sci-fi pull off a similar atmosphere, perhaps none as expertly. For that, I have great respect for the film. But if you're looking for character, some insight into the human race, 2001 is completely irrelevant. So I can only say its above average.",7,0,3,21 July 2014
Avatar," Pretty? Yes. Timeless? No.
","Man, how life changes. 5 years ago, in the theater, I really liked the movie. Half a decade later, I catch an FX screening on cable. Darn, did my rating this time around drop. It could be my refined tastes, or the increased abundance of CGI. But this re-watch convinced me that, unless the sequels are amazing, Avatar will be forgotten as CGI technology improves. At least it deserve to be. :/ Nothing about the plot or character stands out as unique (beyond the setting) or realistic. The themes of prejudice, war, and environmentalism have been done to death. Of course, practically anything can be great with good writing, characters relateable to the human condition. But no. The characters are universally stock and bland. There's the good, native aliens and there's the evil, modern, greedy humans. There's no shades of gray. A film that runs 161 minutes should have more depth than this. Oh, and let's be honest: nobody actually believed the main romantic interest...did they?Why don't I hate Avatar? Well, because visually, it is a beautiful movie. The CGI is very good and used abundantly. Its practically more of an animated film than 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?'. It does a great job at portraying an alien jungle, its inhabitants, and the sci-fi elements. The battle scenes are alright.I'd only watch it if you're really attracted to its style. As the years go by, there will be more and more movies that can match Avatar's specs. Sooner than later, Avatar will be average and forgettable. Its already surprisingly ignored for the highest-grossing movie of all time. Without its effects, its completely derivative, so I wouldn't recommend it highly.",5,4,6,11 September 2014
A Clockwork Orange," By Using Two Extremes, Kubrick Fails to State Anything About Humanity
","Alex DeLarge is one of the most despicable characters ever portrayed in film. He steals, assaults, rapes, and kills without a second thought. He does not have psychotic charisma, nor does he have strong bonds with friends, family, or lovers. He's a true monster, with no positive human characteristics.Which is a titanic flaw of the film. Alex DeLarge is not a human being. He is only a caricature, used to force a point. He is impossible to relate to, and isn't relevant to 99.99% of the population.Yet we are to take him as some kind of tragic anti-hero? We are supposed to be terrified by his forced psychological conditioning? I don't buy it. Every scene in the film was evidence that Alex was not stable enough to be a productive member of society and would never change. If he wasn't mentally neutered, he would have only harmed more people until his untimely end. People may blather on how it robs Alex of his freedom of choice, how the government is even worse than Alex, but at the end of the day, they know which version they'd rather invite to dinner.Honestly, this story could have been great if it allowed for some sense of moral ambiguity, some shreds of humanity to both the violent, rebellious Alex and the pathetic, shell-shocked Alex. It would make the government's actions far more questionable, and Alex's character far more dramatic. But as is, Alex reaps what he sows, but avoids true punishment through luck and politics.The film wasn't lifelessly drab, so it keeps one more star. Stanley Kubrick knows where to point the camera, if nothing else. But its lack of realistic character makes any of its statements debunked before they reach the debate. Its the thinking man's exploitation film, and deserves as much respect.",2,9,16,21 July 2014
Eyes Wide Shut," Not Erotic, Not Inditing, Not Realistic - Pointless
","I think Andrew Yorkshades's review is the perfect smackdown for this overrated swan song. I feel I need to find this man, and smoke some cigars as we reminiscence on our three hour torture.The one point I'd like to add - the relationship in this film has no bearing to real life. For a final time, Kubrick forces his characters into such polarized roles to prove a point, they cease to be characters. 99.9% of women would not react to Cruise's revelation as Kidman does. No woman would desperately want to bang you shortly after you told them of your attempted infidelity. There'd be a long healing phase, if the divorce papers aren't delivered! The fact she thinks sex will solve their problems shows either the character's and/or the director's immaturity. Either way, why should we care? The relationship is banal, even in its flaws.Stanley Kubrick is a cinematic God - blindly worshiped and unquestionable. One must wonder what he could have made for his fans to call him out. People can interpret this film a million ways - some even say it has clues on the Illuminati. For me, it was a boring, unrealistic, pretentious waste of time.",2,1,6,27 July 2014
Thor," A Generic Action Film With a Superhero Coat of Paint
","Thor's 77% on Rotten Tomatoes is the #1 reason why I don't try out Marvel movies. I'm willing to see popcorn-only films, but Thor is so average, the action doesn't cover up the bland characters and pandering plot.The deepest characters are barely two dimensional. You never get to sense Loki's deep envy of Thor, and Thor's only defining trait is arrogance. There is potential for Thor to grow up, but he never matures. He is punished for breaking the peace...but is forgiven for being heroic, a trait he never lacked. This is not how character arcs work!And they're the most developed characters of the film. Anthony Hopkins literally sleeps through most of the movie. Sif and 'The Warriors Three' are one dimensional, forgettable, wastes of time. S.H.I.E.L.D.'s inclusion is pointless, and the trio of human characters Thor hangs out with only subtract from the film. Kat Dennings only delivers 'funny' quips, and the romantic subplot with Thor and Natalie Portman's character is as forced as they get. There's more romantic chemistry in Marley and Me. The only character I could get behind was Heimdall. Idris Elba keeps ending up as the strongest actor in character-weak films. But Heimdall serves little purpose beyond his role as gatekeeper.If you really like comic books, I suppose the action is okay, but I was never amazed, nor amused by camp. I can't believe it doesn't get called out for its terrible script more often. Its just another Hollywood action flick that doesn't even pull of the tropes well. We deserve better than this.",4,2,4,24 July 2014
Castle in the Sky," An Adventure For All Ages
","Ah, I remember first seeing this on Toonami. Month of Miyazaki was the best thing they ever did. Every Saturday, me, my sister, and mother would all sit together and have a great time. Except for Valley of the Wind, which we missed. :P Castle in the Sky is a perfectly fine movie, one that can be enjoyed by child and adult alike. Its adorable, adventurous, and, as usual for Ghibli, beautiful. The scenes on Laputa itself are among the best in Ghibli's filmography, in terms of gorgeous animation and background (IMHO).I find myself giving many Ghibli films 7/10s. I'm not sure that's accurate. They are wonderful, with animation quality that's rarely matched. But they're not all brilliant in writing, or even have strong characters. Yet I don't feel they're missing something. They're good as they are. If you think Castle in the Sky is your kind of movie, it'll certainly please you.",7,2,3,5 August 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," An Above Average Blockbuster
","I don't have too much to say about Edge of Tomorrow, other than I'm pretty pleased. The concept is original and developed, the lead characters are likable and 3-dimensional, the pacing is excellent, and it even stole a few laughs from my theater.Minor issues - I wasn't a big fan of any character besides Cruise's and Blunt's. Their only role was to supply additional guns for the ending. The Magic 2014 Slivers are interesting, but almost too kinetic. Its difficult to grasp how they're beating the humans in combat. Projectiles are fired at Earth's forces, but I couldn't guess how the Mimics are firing them. Cannons? From their mouths? I don't think we ever see them shoot on screen.Its a good action film, fresh and 'smart' (for the lack of a better word). Its a fine rental.",7,1,3,28 July 2014
Rango," Great Animation, Little Point
","Rango's animation is perfect for a western world (with animals). And from a distance, the characters seem interesting. Too bad there's little payout from this film. It succeeds as a homage to westerns, but there's nothing to really take away from Rango. Our main character's story has been done dozens of times, and nothing new is brought to the table. His relationships are quite weak, even with his love interest. If there is any moral at all to the story, its modern society sucks, the wild west rocked? Alright.Other pet peeves include A. Some dumb jokes made by bit characters B. Lack of a satisfying fight with Rattlesnake Jake. C. A cop-out ending.Okay, its not that awful. Some of the action scenes are a lot of fun. And again, the animation is great. It may not be a bad way to pass the time. But if you are looking for character and plot, I find Rango very hard to defend.",5,0,0,30 August 2014
The Iron Giant," An Unexpected Classic
","Everyone loves The Iron Giant. Who can hate this movie? Its got the adventure any kid would wish, and the serious moments that leave goosebumps on your skin. The characters are energetic, and quite likable, with more dimension than the standard kid's film. Heck, it even makes me like the 1950s, arguably the dullest, most white-washed decade of the 20th century.Its funny, its suspenseful, its heart-warming...its just a good animated film in all areas. You'll love the kid, you'll love the suave beatnik artist, and of course, you'll love the powerful, mysterious, yet gentle, Iron Giant himself. Its defiantly one of those movies I'll keep returning to throughout the years.",8,0,1,5 October 2014
Blade Runner," *Yawns*
","Who knew a film named 'Blade Runner', a movie with such high praise, could be so boring. TBH, I stopped paying attention halfway though, and surfed the web on my phone. Blade Runner's lone quality is it looks great. As with Alien, it does everything a sci-fi movie should do. Its dark, its detailed, and shows off the culture and technology.Other than that? As an action film, its abysmally paced, with no special scenes or charismatic characters. As a 'deep, philosophical' film...I don't buy it. You can't support your themes without strong characters. And Blade Runner's entire cast is uninteresting. It may have been intentional for them to be lifeless and robotic, but this movie didn't make me care about machines. Why even bother answering the questions this movie supposedly asks? 'Is genetic engineering ethical? What makes us human?' Who cares? I don't care anymore after this film than I did before.The noir romantic relationship had zero impact on me. Just as typical and shallow as any other relationship from the genre. But I suppose its okay, since Scott meant to do that. *eye rolls* Its another sci-fi classic that seems like it can get away with anything if its shot well and merely mentions its themes. I'm not going to give it a second chance.",3,23,46,9 September 2014
Monsters University," A Solid Comedy and Family Film
","People can be very reactionary. After lukewarm reviews of Brave, a few were already talking about the death of Pixar. I give companies more room than that to screw up, but I was growing apprehensive, to be honest. If Monsters University wasn't good, it would be the fourth film in a row to underwhelm me. (Toy Story 3's ending was great, but the rest was just alright) Monster's University is a prequel, so we're lounging around already explored territory. We also have a good idea how the film will end as soon as we begin. It also borrows heavily from every college movie ever made, without a lot of parody.I still had fun. :V Its a bright, colorful, and funny film, with some of the best laughs I had that year. Mike and Sully are still good characters - they are mean to each other at first, but you do see them gradually form their friendship.But my favorite part about the movie is its message. The whole 'believe in yourself' shtick, although a noble idea, is often the last resort for movies trying to find something to teach. Just look at Shrek 3 and Foodfight! Monsters University slaps those movies in the face, showing that sometimes, you will fail, even if you try hard. But life goes on, and with hard effort, you'll eventually find your place. Considering the poorly-reviewed Turbo and Planes also came out in Summer 2013, Monsters University sticks out as intelligent, not falling for the clichés of cash-ins.My biggest complaint is that Randall's role is one step above cameo. He could have been removed entirely, and we wouldn't have noticed. Ah well. Its still a fine movie.",7,1,2,10 August 2014
Thor: The Dark World," No Lessons Learned
","Lulz. The IMDb rating is at a solid 7.2, but the written reviews are mostly panning the movie. And rightfully so. Thor 2 does little to improve from the last entry. While we have better visuals and more Loki, the character, plot devices, and comedic relieve are just as bad, if not worse. If it weren't for the enormous budget, the movie would have blew. I usually give some lenience towards plot devices. You can't let small parts of a movie ruin the entire experience. But crap were they awful here. I've rarely seen a film so contrived, so desperate to use characters that don't belong. But we need to have the brothers team up, and who would our Norse God be without a beautiful woman by his side? The Aether has no rhyme or reason to what it actually does, and the villains were store shelf. But none of the characters had enough time to develop beyond movie clichés.I disliked Kat Dennings in the first one. Now I hate her. She's a complete ditz who has no respect for the impossible events going on. She breaks tense moments with dollar-store lines, devoid of comedic creativity. But we also have some useless intern, and Dr. Erik Selvig. He's turned into 'movie crazy', a man who acts delusional, but is really a misunderstood genius. Its a stupid and offensive plot point, made by imbeciles who don't know, nor care, about mental health. Thor's Girlfriend (it might as well be her name) still lacks any connection with Thor, and is such a bit player in the story. She's supposed to be a genius scientist, but everything she says is Hollywood gobbledegook. The only strength beyond the production values is Loki. Most of the good moments of the film revolve around him. He has the most personality, and is the only character to develop in any way. But his relationships still need fleshing out. I need more time to buy his love and hate for his family.Are you really that desperate for a time-waster? C'mon. There are better action movies out there. Thor: Dark World will soon be forgotten. I'd never recommend it, but there's worse I suppose.",4,0,1,20 October 2014
Godzilla," Still One of The Best Godzilla Films
","Seeing the original trailers for the film, I was convinced it was going to be the best movie this year. They emphasized not on the colossal action of Godzilla vs other monsters, but on the pure devastation such a creature would leave in its wake. Like the 1954 one, but using the latest technology to fully enhance its vision.Sadly, we got a monster vs monster film. Not a bad one, necessarily. But instead of the scourge of humanity, Godzilla's our uncontrollable hero. I'd preferred a darker Godzilla film, to bring some fresh air to Hollywood blockbusters and the franchise.Some people complain about the pacing of the film. On paper, I think it's done perfectly. There's a lot of buildup, yet things are always happening. The damage by these creatures is devastating, yet controlled enough so you aren't desensitized. Some shots are done very well, truly emphasizing the creatures' titanic size. The CGI blows the costumed men out of the water, and even does a good job on the destruction. The final battle is climactic, and earned cheers in our theater.Unfortunately, the characters are pretty weak. Godzilla films aren't know for their personalities, but by this era, we should have some relateable characters. I literally cannot say a single defining trait about our main character. He's just a typical, handsome action lead who isn't even particularly handsome. More is known about the surface of Mars than his relationship between his wife and kid. They're obviously included as a cheap attempt to pull heartstrings. Bryan Cranston's and Ken Watanabe's characters are better, but ultimately have too little time and too little depth. The weakness of the characters makes the Jaws-esq pacing a bit disappointing.I still had a good time. The ending fight scene was totally worth it, and the action and destruction beforehand impressed me. It should have been better, though. Hopefully the sequel will correct its problems and tread new ground while pleasing fans.",6,1,3,26 July 2014
Princess Mononoke," A Masterpiece
","Princess Mononoke is one of Studio Ghibli's most acclaimed films, only behind Spirited Away. And few films deserve so much praise. Princess Mononoke is beautiful, emotional, and surprisingly violent. When I first watched it at 13/14, it was like nothing I'd ever seen, and it holds up.Miyazaki's films, especially Castle in the Sky and Nausicaa, focus on man's relationship with nature. But in these films, its clear that the environmentally-unfriendly military men are the bad guys. There is little characterization to them. Princess Mononoke is the ultimate evolution of these ideas, where neither side is portrayed as good or evil. Lady Eboshi, the leader of the mining town, is callous towards nature, but kind to her people, taking in those society has thrown away. The gods and beasts of the forest exhibit similar love and hate. This balance makes the world more realistic, and the danger more terrifying. And while some sort of peace is made between the sides, Miyazaki doesn't force a perfect answer.But its more than environmental commentary. The animation is among the best. Combined with majestic backgrounds of nature and a dramatic orchestra score, only other Ghibli films come close to matching Princess Mononoke's beauty. The action is thrilling, with perfect dramatic tension and intimidating creatures to face against the humans. Its one of the hardest PG-13 films I've seen, so don't show it to underage kids.Princess Mononoke is an anime classic. Everyone whose a fan of animation has seen this film. I'm just another voice gushing over it. If you're not a fan of anime, I promise you it doesn't fall for its immature tropes. If a 9-star film had to be a 10, I'd choose this one.",9,1,3,27 July 2014
The Simpsons Movie," Why The Simpsons Shouldn't Run for 87 Minutes
","I like The Simpsons. Its one of only two sitcoms I'll watch. They've seen better days, but I'll still defend their newer episodes. So of course I eventually watched their movie. But even after reading reviews, I was still disappointed by how average The Simpsons Movie is.As many have said, The Simpsons Movie is less a movie and more a long episode. The scope is barely larger than the more outrageous episodes, and the animation is only slightly better. I'd sooner believe it cost $7.5 million to make before $75 million. We're on the big screen, with a higher budget than ever...but why?The worst part of the movie's mediocrity is the writing. While the usual chuckles are still spread through the film, the arcs of the characters are just rehashes of dozens of episodes. Homer causes chaos because of his selfishness and stupidity. Homer and Marge bicker, but eventually make amends. Homer and Bart settle their differences. Its nothing we haven't seen before. Its totally predicable, yet ultimately pointless. Homer will never grow up, he'll fight with Marge over and over again, and he'll choke his son when it suites the scripts. Not even a big-budget movie can convince The Simpsons to evolve. And you can only run on a premise for so long before it grows stale.I suppose these problems also exist in the series. But they were contained in 30 minutes, plus commercials. They also used other characters from the show to add spice and satire. They are little more than cameos here.The Simpsons Movie could have been explosive, emotional, or the bridge to update a tiring franchise. Instead, its nothing. Which isn't to say its unfunny. It just should have been more. I'd only recommend it to devout Simpsons fans, and they've all seen this already.",5,0,1,29 July 2014
Law Abiding Citizen," The Litmus Test for Viewer Idiocy
","I didn't love this film by any means. It focused too much on the violence, not enough on the characters, and its plot is impossible. But I will have to give it this - its themes and execution have revealed a lot about the movie-going audience. Indeed, they're dumb, emotional, and shallow.People love to romanticize vigilante justice. Its brave, rebellious, and edgy! Of course people would cheer for a man giving eeevvviiilll villains their just desserts. 'Who cares if he's breaking the law? He's the good guy! Our justice system screwed him over!' What empty platitudes. While no justice system is perfect, it is far better than vigilante justice. Its easy to defend it as some glorious act when its against a murdering rapist. People forget when it hits the innocent, or those who stood a chance at reform. Believe it or not, people actually have different opinions. And we can't allow all of them in our legal system.Yet time after time, I've seen people hate this film because it doesn't let them indulge in their vigilante power fantasy. They want the film to pander to their wants, ignoring the horrible deeds vigilantes can commit. And such a movie would be boring. For all its faults, at least Law Abiding Citizen tries to show how desire for revenge can encompass one's life, that 'good' and 'evil' are sometimes intertwined. It mostly failed, but it at least tried. But that's not what the audience wants, I guess. Just impossible intelligence, impossible success, and impossible luck, no message of real subsistence attached. As pure as justice porn gets.I think I should start showing this movie to new people I meet, just to judge their character. This may be my most visceral disagreement in film. In a world filled with generic action films, I can't believe people not only want another unchallenging popcorn flick, but demand a film cater to their personal fantasies. Its depressing.",5,0,0,2 October 2014
