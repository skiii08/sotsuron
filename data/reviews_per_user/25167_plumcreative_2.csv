Hereditary," Random and confusing
","I don't understand why Toni Collette is in this movie. She is better than this.
The movie was so far out there that it made no sense. If these people have all these terrible things happen in their lives why are they not seeing a therapist to help them get through it.
If there was really Satan worship going on then there should have been some more explanation. It just seemed to be a bunch of random gross and shocking imagery and happenings strung together.
And, if the satanic ritual really was a success will they get all the riches or whatever they were after? What was the meaning of the miniatures the main character was making? Why was she climbing around on the ceiling? That was particularly bizarre.
The entire movie was just too random and confusing. I'd give it a 0 if I could.",1,2,7,10 August 2019
The Favourite," Interesting costumes
","I haven't seen a movie I disliked this much in a while. The costumes, sets, scenery, and acting were all very good-- unfortunately it was all wasted on a plot that kind of just dwindled down to nothing. (It did encourage me to do some reading about Queen Anne, so I guess that is a good thing.) I've not yet read any other reviews because I didn't want them to influence what I wrote- so I will be very curious to see what the high-raters said.
Maybe the filmmakers were shooting for something 'arty' and missed. If that was the goal it did not go far enough or get weird enough. It just seemed like a movie with a plot that went nowhere.
Bottom line: All the talent and beauty in this film is wasted on a movie that should be so low on any list that no one would ever get to it.
