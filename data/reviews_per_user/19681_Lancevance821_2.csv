Skyfall," Wow really?
",let me start off by saying I love james bond so much!!! I think craig is great in casino and quantum of solace. But this movie was so bad here is why.the villain was about as scary as an employee of a mac store.the new Q looks like an indie rocker groupie bond doesn't have his new dbs Austin martin.bond has a very weird shower scene he just shows up in there naked with out saying anything.then the french bond girl has 4 lines then dies by a bet with whiskey and one shota large kamoto dragon saves bonds life by eatting a large Asian manfor 5 mins bond stares at London then for 10 mins he stares and walks around Scotland with nothing going on.they play home alone in a old mansion for about 30 min built in the middle of no where. I mean they put shotgun shots under the floor boards and little grenades in the light fixtures. I was expecting to see 5 gallon paint cans hit people in the face. This is was the biggest let down in the theaters I've ever had. Don't believe the hype. The best thing I can say is I used free tickets to see this!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!,1,9,19,10 November 2012
Spider-Man 3," Spider-man 3 and the worst casting as Venom !!!!!!
",There was to much story going on. And no offense to the actor playing Venom but that has to be the worst casting choice in the history of Hollywood. Venom is a jock (in comics) that is at least 40lbs bigger then Parker and much taller. I try to over look certain things in movies but this was so incredibly bad that it needs a 1/10.They had to many villains in here that there backstory was never really told in detail enough for anyone to care about them. There should have only been 2 villains at most. This whole movie feels rushed and forced. The writing was so bad and the acting felt pushed. I felt so cheated that I spent money to see this movie.,1,2,3,4 March 2012
