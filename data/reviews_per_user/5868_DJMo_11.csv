Black Swan," There is a thin line between perfectionism and insanity
","Darren Aronofsky immerses the viewer in the world of the dancer, where performance anxiety is routine and one is always looking over one's shoulder. Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman in a mesmerizing and Oscar-worthy performance) is a fragile ballerina coddled by an overprotective and infantilizing mother. Her perfectionism attracts the attention of ballet director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel in a brilliantly creepy performance), who on the one hand encourages her poise and controlled form for the role of the White Swan but on the other hand, finds difficulty cultivating the looser, more seductive form required for the role of the Black Swan. He believes that he can coax this performance out of her, and Nina pushes herself to meet this expectation. She endures the director's rebukes, her mother's suffocating attention (and career-associated guilt trips), the knowledge of what happened to the company's former star ballerina, and the arrival of her rebellious understudy, Lily (played surprisingly well by Mila Kunis). Despite all of these obstacles, as Leroy tells her later, 'the only thing standing in your way is you.' Aronofsky distills themes from 'All About Eve,' 'The Red Shoes,' 'The Wrestler' (his companion piece with similar themes from 2008), and of course the Swan Lake ballet itself, with imagery inspired by early Polanski (i.e. 'Repulsion,' 'The Tenant') and Cronenberg (i.e. 'Videodrome'), as well as deft use of black, white, and red color and moody chiaroscuro. While it is not quite as disturbing as 'Requiem for a Dream' (few things are), it is just as visceral and engaging and is probably Aronofsky's best film.",9,13,26,9 December 2010
Changeling," Jolie delivers one of her best performances
","'Changeling' is based on a true story. It's a harrowing account of a mother whose son disappears for 5 months but is subsequently returned to her, or is he? Angelina Jolie delivers one of her best performances, with shades of her Oscar-winning 'Girl, Interrupted' performance. In fact, her performance is probably even better in this film. However, although the film is promising at first, it devolves into a diluted hodgepodge of mystery/thriller, conventional courtroom drama, and social commentary on police corruption, civil commitment, and capital punishment. Nevertheless, Clint Eastwood knows how to spin a yarn and paces the film just right to draw you in (except the end, which is a bit overlong).",7,4,8,22 December 2008
Burn After Reading," Interesting but uneven screwball comedy
","'Burn After Reading' is an interesting but uneven screwball comedy about greed, vanity, and the CIA. If that sounds pretty random, that's because it is. The film struggled to find an appropriate tone, juxtaposing funny and serious elements haphazardly. One might characterize it as one of the Coen brothers' minor works. However, it doesn't seem that way given the all-star cast. Thankfully, the efforts of Pitt, McDormand, Clooney, Swinton, and Malkovich aren't completely wasted. There are plenty of laughs and decent performances all around. Seeing Brad Pitt act like a tool is worth the price of admission. However, in the end, the viewer is left with an inconsequential, so what?",7,1,3,22 December 2008
Collateral," A claustrophobic sense of urgency in a haunting, noirish, apathetic Los Angeles.
","Vincent (Tom Cruise) is a hit man who hires a cabbie, Max (Jamie Foxx), to help him do his dirty work in L.A. Cruise is a stone cold killer who is blunt but insightful, and almost likable, if it weren't for the fact that his conversation with you probably means that he's going to shoot you in the face the next minute. Foxx is terrific in his role as a hapless cabbie; he conveys a sense of quiet desperation as he is figuring out how to cope with the predicament he's in. Director Michael Mann borrows a page from 'Rear Window' and 'The French Connection' to develop a tense and thrilling climax. Mann paces the movie well and creates a claustrophobic sense of urgency in the taxicab and a haunting, noirish, apathetic Los Angeles.",8,0,0,2 January 2005
Kick-Ass," Hilariously over-the-top!
","A hilariously over-the-top campy comic book adaptation. Aaron Johnson and Christopher Mintz-Plasse are pretty good in their dorky roles. But Chloe Moretz is awesome as Hit Girl and has some laugh-out-loud one-liners. She steals every scene she's in, complementing or offsetting Nicholas Cage's uneven performance as Big Daddy. The film also serves as an interesting social commentary about our passive, spectator YouTube culture, a satire about the glorification of violence and our modern devolution into a world of social apathy. Perhaps that is why the premise of the film -- real-life superheroes -- is so foreign to the audience at the outset until the extreme violence reminds you to sit back and enjoy: it's just a comic book.",7,1,5,13 November 2010
2001: A Space Odyssey," A transcendent journey through space and time
","With carte blanche (essentially) from a then struggling MGM, Kubrick (in collaboration with renowned sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke) had artistic license to develop '2001' as he saw fit.  What he created was his magnum opus, a visually stunning and visionary depiction of space and the future. The film is a transcendent journey through space and time that is open to numerous interpretations.  I interpreted the film as a cautionary cosmic satire about the influence and imperfection of technology in our lives as well as an explorational philosophical vehicle forcing the viewer to delve into his/her creative consciousness and imagine the greater future potential of mankind.  The film's continuing success can be attributed to the visual wonder and awe that is inspired by the film, its believability even today (due in no small part to the extensive research of the production crew and the participation of consultants ranging from NASA to IBM), as well as its evolving interpretations through the decades.  In particular, even as the year 2001 has come and gone, the film raises profound questions about the progress and destiny of mankind and technology, issues that have timeless relevance.",10,0,2,14 February 2003
A Clockwork Orange," A stylish interpretation of Burgess's dystopian novel -OR- misogynist art porn masquerading as relevant social commentary? (possible spoilers)
","Perhaps a bit of both.  While the visual shock of the 'ultraviolence' has diminished over time, the inherent perversity of the acts and the aloof demeanor and sociopathic sadism and apathy of the droogs can still elicit responses of disgust and repulsion from viewers.  However, the almost comic tone and musical-like choreography in Kubrick's presentation leave others wondering exactly how to react and undermine the perceived severity of the crimes being committed.  Nevertheless, Malcolm Macdowell effectively captures the amoral essence of Alex on-screen, his charismatic and well-mannered veneer belying his perverted and ingrained sociopathic tendencies.  After an arrogant power trip and betrayal by his disillusioned droogs, Alex goes to prison.  There, he learns of and enrolls in an experimental aversion therapy program in an effort to rehabilitate himself (although it is unclear if his motives are to get better or to get out of jail more quickly).  The tables are then turned on Alex, and the viewer is shown that the inhumanity of society's punishment is as repulsive as the depravity of Alex's crimes.  The film raises a variety of socially relevant questions: Is society truly able to ever rehabilitate criminals? (is this Alex's case solely, or youth in general?) What are the dangers of allowing society to remove free will in exchange for security?  What means, if any, are useful and/or justifiable to change the inherent nature of a person? With increased fear in the present age, societally and self-imposed suspensions of freedom, and recent phenomena like the reprehensible idea of 'the criminal as victim', Burgess's prescience and Kubrick's provocative vision of Burgess's dystopia seem quite relevant and foreboding.",9,4,7,14 February 2003
WALL·E," Wall-E is an instant animated classic!
","Unlike other Pixar films, I went into this one knowing next to nothing about the characters or storyline. I was absolutely floored. The film reminded me of Kubrick's '2001' and Chaplin's 'City Lights' and 'Modern Time' with Wall-E as the cute Chaplinesque robot on a mission of self-discovery and love. Eve is the perfect foil / robot love interest (whose design was allegedly influenced by the iPod). How often can a film, much less an animated film, mesh romantic silent film with sci-fi, consumerist satire, and post-apocalyptic dark comedy all in one? Sure, the 'humans are slobs' motif is a bit heavy-handed, but I suppose our society deserves the wake-up call, subtle or not. 'Wall-E' is hands-down the greatest animated film ever made.",9,2,5,22 December 2008
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Woody Allen's best since Crimes and Misdemeanors
","Yes, I would have ranked this just as highly without Penelope and ScarJo's tasty makeout scene. Barcelona and Oviedo provide a beautiful cinematic backdrop for this dark romantic drama, which offers a commentary on the ennui of the wealthy and the romantic plight of artists. It's better than 'Match Point' and is probably Woody Allen's best film since 'Crimes and Misdemeanors'. Javier Badem cleans up nicely as the estranged artist (after his 'No Country For Old Men' role). Penelope Cruz turns in an Oscar-worthy performance as the neurotic ex-wife of the artist. Rebecca Hall does a fine job as the sensible fiancée and ScarJo isn't bad either as the open-minded romantic free spirit.",8,0,3,22 December 2008
Sin City," Beautifully gory, dystopic yet hopeful
","Neither watching the classics of film noir (i.e. The Third Man, Touch of Evil), nor the Tarantino-influencing Shochiku New Wave classics of Seijun Suzuki (i.e. Branded to Kill and Tokyo Drifter), nor even the hardcore pulp of Takashi Miike (i.e. 'Audition' or the disorganized, gory insanity of 'Visitor Q' or 'Dead or Alive') can really prepare you for 'Sin City'. As a fairly desensitized horror/gore/cult movie fan, I still could not immediately take in all of the darkness and stark, stylized violence I was about to see, to say nothing of the seedy subject matter. It's a film of contradictions that vaunts machismo yet displays a beneath-the-surface vulnerability; it is misogynistic yet empowering, dystopic yet hopeful, and crude, raw, and debasing yet beautiful and humanistic.The surreal violence and gore is the type that one can't easily take one's eyes off of. It's a reflection of the darkest realities of our world (corruption, murder (seems to be 50% of all news), child murder, capital punishment, prostitution, depraved clergy, etc.) brought before a larger-than-life monochrome on-screen microscope.The performances are appropriate throughout, providing a unique star-studded glorified B-movie feel. Even the occasionally ineffectual (though very hot) Jessica Alba and (sorta hot) Britanny Murphy play their roles well. Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Bruce Willis deliver particular commendation for the hard-nosed, hard-boiled portrayal of their respective characters. Elijah Wood, Benicio Del Toro, Nick Stahl, Rutger Hauer, and Josh Hartnett are also mesmerizing wicked in their roles.The three comic panel-like vignettes allow the viewer to appreciate the many facets of Sin City without becoming too absorbed in any one of the emotionally/morally damaged on-screen persona's. However, this approach amplifies the sense of pervasive evil in the sadistic, might-makes-right, kill-or-be-killed city.Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller deliver a technically accomplished cinematographic knockout with minimalistic black-and-white providing a contrast to and accentuating the garish red, white, and yellow (much of it blood). For his trouble, Rodriguez was ousted from the Director's Guild of America for including first-time director Frank Miller in the credits. I hope the accolades he receives for 'Sin City' will serve as a sufficient 'f*ck you' to the DGA, because this is a brilliant collaboration that is unlike anything previously achieved on film.",8,0,0,16 April 2005
Slumdog Millionaire," One of the best films of 2008
","Like a cross between 'City of God', 'Quiz Show', and hmm, 'The Usual Suspects', 'Slumdog Millionaire' is Danny Boyle's ('Trainspotting', '28 Days Later') best film to date. Set in the slums of Mumbai, the story traces back through each successive game show question from Jamal Malik's (Dev Patel) tragic childhood in abject squalor, through his life as a teenager in the slums with his criminal-minded brother Salim (Madhur Mittal), and Jamal's pursuit of lifelong crush Latika (the incredibly beautiful Freida Pinto). It starts off auspiciously and ends somewhat conventionally and a little trite, but it's impossible in this case not to root for the underdog. The soundtrack features famed Indian producer A.R. Rahman and M.I.A.",8,3,6,22 December 2008
