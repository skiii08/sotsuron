The Blair Witch Project," Three College students set out to make a documentary based on an Urban legend
","I've seen this movie a couple of times and at first thought it was stupid but I also saw the sequel. Weirdly enough, I liked that one! I saw the original again and even though I couldn't quite get what was happening in every sequence I could understand the three of them eventually grating on each others nerves, becoming disoriented and then scared and desperate to get back to the car and home. However I was never one for camping and one of my main reasons is the woods have a way of messing up your head and if you REALLY don't know where your going and don't have a lot of time on your hands or more than two people with you who are experienced about doing that sort of thing, then maybe ya shouldn't attempt it.",8,0,1,29 January 2008
