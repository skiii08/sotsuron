Blade Runner 2049," Deep follow up to a classic
","If you loved the first film, the second will not disapoint, but you really need to have seen the first and understood what its all about.Here our concepts of life and free will....and the rights that go with it are further tested when we are encouraged to develop the same attachments our main character has with his partner, who is of course purely digital AI. The extensions of the thought provoking concepts are great IMO, but for the less interested in the original the film may be slow and too long.",9,1,4,23 June 2018
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," A must see movie
","This film is my favourite drama ever. Hard hitting and thought provoking.....this film highlights the enormous failings of our metal health systems, which were (and probably still are) not curing or encouraging recovery....but containing and controlling.In this movie we see our main characters optimism and rebellious ways start to help the other inmates improve and recover from their problems....In the end we see our leading lady playing the nurse not only undo soem healthy recovery ..... but actually prey of his insecurities and drive him to a terrible end. Our lead man loses it and I felt all his anger and could see myself acting as he did in shear rage.....this is one of the strongest most emotional moments of any film i have ever watched, but brilliantly the gloom is tempered with a glourious ending of sublime hope.A remarkable story, brilliantly played by all the cast.....superb",10,0,0,23 June 2018
