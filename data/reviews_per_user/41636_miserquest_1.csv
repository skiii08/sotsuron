Skyfall," Keep your minds open
","There have been two rather diverse strands of opinions emerging regarding Skyfall. The first expresses utter dismay at the plot, while the second heaps endless praise for the film despite certain plot twists that require our suspension of disbelief. I am of the latter camp, and I will now tell you why.I believe that many people - whether films buffs or Fleming's fans, devout faithfuls or new converts - walked into the cinemas, popcorn in hand, high expectations in the heart. Those who felt disappointed by Sam Mendes were eager to point out how the plot was riddled with flaws that were not traditional of James Bond movies. But the truth is that the world we live in today is far more different than that of Sean Connery's, and our dear 007, classic as he is, must adapt to the times as well.Indeed, Skyfall takes its cue from The Dark Knight Rises. I'm not saying that it ripped Nolan off wholesale, but that I sensed quite a few thinly veiled similarities while watching the movie. Perhaps it slightly disappointed me that they did not bother to conceal the similarities, but rather than diminishing the appeal of the film, it added a new dimension of smartness to the plot, one that we might never have heralded two decades ago.The acting is brilliant. Every single actor, veteran and newbies alike, fleshed out their role incredibly well with great professionalism. Daniel Craig once again emits charisma and will make you fall for him all over again, just like all the Bond girls have, though admittedly his character faces some setbacks this time round. And forget all the homo erotic criticisms you have heard about Javier Bardem's character - go in with an open mind and see for yourself how this actor carries the movie incredibly well. I'm only addressing these two because they're the main characters, but you will see that the rest fit in superbly as well, each one of them extremely endearing in their own quirky fashion.Despite initial worries about Sam Mendes, all doubt has been wiped out. He has deftly crafted out a masterpieces that marries the old with the new. Even as he adds a personal touch to the number, he does not lose sight of James Bond and all that he has represented throughout the years.You will leave the cinema with both a heavy heart and yet catharsis as its primary themes will resonate with you - that of modern day, technological terrorism, family/kinship, as well as the deeply evocative idea of growing old. Although it did leave me wondering how James Bond would carry on with two more films if they are already confronting his journey with age, it will ignite faith in you that the upcoming sequels will be even better.Skyfall shines brightly on its own and brings renewed hope for the series following the dismal disappointment that is the Quantum of Solace. The action, cinematography and visual effects all add up to a seat-gripping ride. It will be a magnificent experience for those seeking the familiar, enigmatic secret agent in a challenging pursuit once more - just keep your mind open.",9,2,10,10 November 2012
