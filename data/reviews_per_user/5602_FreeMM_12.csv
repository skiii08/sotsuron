The Blair Witch Project," Hyped up too much over here
","Unfortunately, the hype preceeded this film, big time.  Instead of falling into the 'is it a true story or not' debate, I knew how it was filmed, what it was about etc.  This spoiled what was an inventive if slow movie.The acting is brilliant and there's no doubt that the level of creativity and originality behind the film is first rate.  Unfortunately, when it comes down to it, Blair Witch has a couple of scary-ish moments.  All to often we are treated to me and my mates going down to the woods when we were twelve and trying to scare each other, with spooky noises.Definite potential for future films, but I'd have to give this a miss, if I was you.",6,0,2,7 November 1999
Casablanca," Heartbreaking
","I watched this film for the first time very recently and share most of the opinions aired on this site.  It is slow and not all the acting is that great.  The dialogue, story and emotion is first class.I'm not saying that they don't make 'em like they used to, but it's hard to think of a story about love that's as strong as this.  I have to say I thought it was great.  I can't analyse the film because to me there is nothing to analyse.  You don't anaylse love you relate to it and the way your emotions are sucked in is it's magic.  Let's hope James Cameron doesn't do a remake.",10,1,1,29 November 2001
Minority Report," Solid film
","Nothing much to say on this one really.  Good direction, acting, effects as you'd expect, just lacking originality with the script, which is basically LA Confidential 100 years later.  I enjoyed it, but have seen better films and films with better homages in.",8,0,0,7 July 2002
Monty Python's Life of Brian," One of the funniest films you will ever see
","A lot of reviewers have highlighted what is so great about this film, it's satire.  Satire is often funny, but never as consistently funny.  This is gut wrenchingly funny as opposed to funny ha ha.  No stone is left unturned. Religion is the but of the joke, but the fundamentalists, socialists and ignorants all get lambasted in a severely underrated film.The concept of Jesus as a chancer and a man who happened to be in the right place at the right time is pure genius.  The utilisation of modern attitudes and language works wonders as this historical tale unwinds and the immaculate conception is explained away in perhaps the most original thought on this matter.  There is joke after joke after joke.  You can't catch them all the first time and it takes repeated viewing to ascertain and appreciate the complexity of the intelligent writing.Beyond the jokes are the messages.  Messages that are so obvious and relevant in today's society, but messages that fall on deaf ears every day.Those that say this isn't funny or isn't their funniest piece of work they just don't know.  They're not there.  They're missing a critical piece of art and historical social commentary that's ever been committed to film.Genius.",10,1,4,20 September 2001
The Mummy," Another great budget wasted.
","Remember Stargate?  Well this is similar, i.e. a potentially great idea ruined.  Egypt offers so much to any storyteller to go mad with, yet no one does.Here we have a film with fantastic special effects, a pretty scary idea, (playing on the old curse of the pharoahs) and a reasonable cast.  The opportunity to create bone shaking myths and to bring something otherworldly into 'The Mummy' was missed.  Instead we are treated to a run-of-the-mill action film, with cheesy lines that, unlike Armageddon, just aren't funny. Rachel Whatever battles bravely to introduce some acting to cinemagoers, but all to no avail as Brendan Fraser and the zany fella with the fez all but mess it up.Despite the amazing stories that constitute Egypt's history, Raiders of the Lost Ark remains the best film to touch upon that magnificent country.",5,0,0,1 July 1999
American Beauty," A Great Film But Not A Top 10 of all time
","Another one of those very rare Hollywood films that give you that little bit more than just entertainment.  First rate performances from all around, particularly the young supporting cast, although this is about Kevin Spacey.A dazzling central performance that puts across your empathy for the character in faultless manner.My only gripe with the film is the praise that is lavished upon it.  It's a great film, but isn't a Top 10 of all time.  Whilst the film satirises and captures the suburban/middle class/American Dream/whatever you want, it doesn't really say anything new to me.  It's a great film, but not in the league of, say, Fight Club which gets it right.  In fact it's like an Easy Listening version of Fight Club (albeit a different message).Worth the watch though, for sure.",9,0,0,2 April 2000
American Beauty," Great film, but not as good as the score says.
","This is a terrificly moving film that confronts the usual downtrodden American Dream going sour cliche.  Unlike, say, Fight Club, American Beauty presents it in an unoffensive way, offering comment-lite which is where the film falls down of fantastic status.There are many better films out there that address the same issues in a much more intelligent and, in some cases, confrontational way.  If you like your film 'spot on' this is it, but it falls short of being subversive which is what it wants to be.You should still watch it though.",9,0,0,7 June 2000
Edward Scissorhands," Exquisite
","A simply wonderful film.  I am neither a goth or a Johnny Depp fan, but this film oozes quality.  Good performances from all concerned, but the real master is the man behind the camera.  Tim Burton's finest hour without a doubt.  Absolutely stunning.Easy to see how he got the Batman job (such a shame for hindsight though)",10,0,0,14 June 1999
Caddyshack," One For The Workers
",If you're not quite as privileged as the rest of the world then you'll love this.  The SNL funny ones (i.e. not Ackroyd or the birds) tell it as it is. Rich people suck.Chock full of some of the best one-liners you'll ever hear.  A comedy classic.  My favourite scene?  Too many to mention.  10/10.,9,0,1,14 June 1999
The Sixth Sense," A great little film
","I liked this film a lot.  It's a slow film, with simple dialogue, but a great premise.  Having kept myself away from all  information about the plot, I went in completely oblivious and was blown away by a superb ending.A film littered with clues and hidden meanings, so much so that i'm gonna have to watch it again.",8,0,0,7 November 1999
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," The Pre-Cursor to The Life Of Brian
","I don't know enough about English History to understand all of the jokes in this film, but suffice to say that it is entertaining and funny, but not as good as The Life of Brian (little us).  Whereas Brian concentrates on a historical story that I can relate to strongly, this does the same but with English History.  The Python's run the same kind of spin on a famous yarn, pointing out how ridiculous the concept of The Holy Grail (and hence, the English Church) is.What does work is the appearance, to me, that they are producing a performance that would fit onto a stage and turning it into a film, which is one of the strongest points of this film.Ultimately, it isn't funny enough to be a great film, but if you've not seen this or The Life of Brian I would recommend both to ascertain just what the Python's were trying to achieve.  No particular order as you'll need to watch both.",7,0,0,9 December 2001
Atonement," Lacks the emotional intensity of The English Patient
","Not quite as bad as I thought it was going to be, given what I'd heard and read here and there but still very much The English Patient for the Heat Magazine crowd. Like Pride And Prejudice the direction is strong, probably a bit earnest and the Dunkirk scene was pretty amazing if striving a bit too hard. I thought the story was interesting but the problem was the two leads who were out of their depth. Funnily enough I felt that it was McAvoy who was the weaker of the two as Knightley did manage to generate a couple of acting moments but all too often it felt a bit Harry Enfield when they were trying to deliver their meaningful dialogue. In comparison to The English Patient where it felt completely natural for the characters to talk in that stylised luvvie dialogue, here it just wasn't working and as a consequence it was difficult to feel the characters' emotions so much so that when the emotional wrench does come it falls a bit flat. If they'd have gone with leads that were a bit more mature and had a bit more presence it might have worked but I still think there'd be a bit of a issue with the source material.",7,0,1,3 April 2008
