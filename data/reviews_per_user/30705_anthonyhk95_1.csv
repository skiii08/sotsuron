The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," It's not a boring movie!
","Okay, this might be long, depending on what I say. First off, I don't really know why people are saying that this movie isn't good as they thought it is. I sat in the theatre watching the whole thing and I didn't lose interest. Personally, I think this movie is pretty good. Now I wanna say something about the characters. First, I wanna say I'm really glad that Effie is in this. Without her and if it has Fulvia in it (like the book), it doesn't seem the same and no one can replace Effie. Another thing is that I was curious about the prep team (Octavia, Flavius and Venia). I was wondering where they were, why they were not in this movie. Also, Delly! Isn't she a supporting character and the one that tries to talk to Peeta about Katniss? But then I remembered that Delly doesn't show up until AFTER Katniss was strangled, so I was hoping she might show up in the second part since the first part ended after the scene when Peeta tried to attack her. Alright, I think I'm done! :)",9,25,65,22 November 2014
