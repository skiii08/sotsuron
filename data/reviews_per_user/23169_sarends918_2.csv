The Blair Witch Project," Hulk Hogan has better movies than this c***
","This is Terrible I wasted good money for one of the biggest disappointment in my life. I totally disagree with most of the reviews the users gave to this so called movie. Weren't the people in the movie suppose to be film students so the first thing they would learn, is how to have a steady aim!",1,11,22,18 November 2000
The Thin Red Line," This was the most boring war movie I've seen
","I can't believe some people said that this was better then the When trumpets fade. I didn't even know it was based in the grueling conflict in Guadalcanal island during the pacific war in world war two until I read the summary. I have to give credit to the anti-war part but it was too long and its lack of entertainment to keep me from doing something else. Last time I checked I didn't have A.D.D.. I have seen plenty of long war movies such as the dirty dozen, All quiet on the western front, and the battle of the bulge. And yet even though our  movie making technology is superior then in 1929 there is no escape from the Hollywood trash that they throw at us.",3,0,1,3 February 2001
