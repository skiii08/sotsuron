The Blair Witch Project," I wish I could cast a negative vote
","According to the comment guidelines, a post has to be at least four lines long, and can't be single word reviews.  I doubt that copying and pasting the words 'bad' and 'awful' over and over again would be allowed.I guess I went into this with too high of an expectation.  Three friends and I tired to see this movie on the third day of the opening weekend, but it was sold out.  So a week later, two of those same friends and I tired again. This time we made it in...with only about six other people.  I know now why there were so few people in the theater that time.  No one was going to see it a second time, and anyone who had seen it before their friends must have done the same thing I did after seeing it...if a friend told me they were going to see it, I did everything possible (short of bludgeoning them with the nearest piece of furniture) to prevent them from seeing it.The home video touch was interesting, and had potential, but it just didn't come off.  The only thing it did for me, was give me the kind of headache and eye strain I get after reading several hundred pages of an engineering textbook or writing a C++ program.  I did not find this movie the least bit scary.  I can think of several other movies that scared or disturbed me much more than this one.  Actually, I spent more time to stiffle my laughter than anything else.I know what some of you are thinking, 'The movie is trying to portray the emotion they are going through being lost out there.  Try putting yourself in their shoes.'  Well, I think I can imagine that desperate feeling they were supposed to be experiencing.  One time while backpacking in the mountains of New Mexico I ended up away from the campsite with several others after dark without any kind of light (it was overcast that night, and somehow six of us forgot to bring along a single flashlight).   It took us an hour to slowly walk only a few hundred yards with everyone holding on to the shoulders of the person in front of them, and the person in front feeling for trees along the side of the trail.  And I don't know how many times I have lay awake in my tent by myself or with one other person trying to figure out if the noises I hear are just the wind, or something looking for a meal, and how big is that something?To this date, I shudder whenever this movie is mentioned.  Not because it scared or disturbed me.  I shudder out of disgust that I wasted so much time on this movie.  I can't believe this actually made it to the big screen. The film should have been burned before it was ever reproduced.",1,20,40,21 January 2001
Unbreakable," Unbreakable was almost unbearable
","I went into this movie expecting something on the par of 'The Sixth Sense', which I thought was a terrific movie.  I walked out with three other people all asking the same question I was, 'What did we just waste  two hours for???'  I spent a little more than half the movie trying to figure out the plot.  Then I suddenly realized, there was no plot.Only the last few minutes were anything of note.  But even those could not make up for the previous hour and a half of lackluster events.  It tired to make that sudden twist at the end like in 'The Sixth Sense', but this time it failed.  Although, it did do a good job at failing.  In 'The Sixth Sense', the twist at the end was so emotional, gut wrenching, and thought provoking because during the whole movie you were being drawn into the story.  Here, you weren't drawn in (I was slowly being repelled during the whole movie because of the lack of a story).  Everything that the little twist refers back to is stuff that you had heard about, and the movie only alluded to.  It didn't give you a chance to get interested.I would liken this viewing experience to my one and only time attending a NASCAR event.  There was a little excitement at the beginning, a little excitement scattered throughout (crashes), and a little excitement at the end.  But all in all, each lap is pretty much like the one before (they are driving around an ellipse, not a whole lot of room for change there). And at the end I walked away wondering why I went through all that trouble to waste several hours of my life for a mild case of sunburn and a sore butt.  I am just glad I didn't have to pay for this event...I wish I could say the same about this movie.At least in this case, the movie theater was climate controlled.  The only reason this isn't going to occupy my Number 1 Bad Movie is because that spot is already claimed by that abomination known as 'The Blair Witch Project', so 'Unbearable', ooops, I mean 'Unbreakable' is going to have to settle for Number 2 on the Bad Movie List.",1,15,32,21 January 2001
Coyote Ugly," Pleasantly surprised
","The previews for this movie didn't leave much of an impression on me.  I remember thinking that this might be an ok movie to see, but I didn't put very high on my list of movies to see.  Even after a co-worker said that he and his wife had gone to one of the first screenings in our area  and both had really enjoyed it, I didn't make any special effort to see it in the theater.  But last night at Blockbuster, I said 'What the heck...' 
In the end, I was mildly surprised, and enjoyed the movie.  There isn't anything special about the plot...girl moves to big city to pursue her dreams, reality sets in, girl meets boy, girl falls in love, girl faces some adversity, girl overcomes adversity and things start to fall into place. Yet, the plot works well for this movie.  I found myself being drawn into the story.  The casting was well done, I felt all the actors did a  good job of filling their parts.  The cinematography was visually stimulating without being over the top or relying on any nudity...yes there is a fair amount of skin flashed but not enough to push the rating over PG-13.  Add to all this a well rounded soundtrack, and you get a movie that is fun and energetic.All in all, I enjoyed this movie.  I may even watch it again before it is due.",7,1,1,11 February 2001
