Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," High Five!
","Holy effin' God this movie is great...i honestly was laughing my @$$ off the entire time, i could not stop. Easily the best movie of the year, and easily the funniest movie ever. I am positive that quotes from this movie will infiltrate American Culture for the next two years, just like Napoleon Dynamite...except ruder, more offensive, dirtier, and funnier. I went on opening night, and it was sold out, so i went again the next day, and it was still sold out. So i drove an hour to an extremely obscure theater and paid ten bucks for a ticket...AND IT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT!'Are you telling me my wife is dead?''Yes...I'm sorry.' 'HIGH FIVE!'",10,2,13,6 November 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Excellent!
","There are only a few sequels that are this much better than the first one, (Empire Strikes Back, Terminator 2) and I am glad to say, this is one of them. The special FX were very well-done, and the very intricate plot set the stage for the third one very well. Also in some parts it was very funny, and I loved seeing the return of some of the supporting cast from the first one, like *spoiler* Norrington and two of the other pirates from the Black Pearl. I won't give away the ending, but I will say that after that ending, I can't wait until next summer. Takemy advice and see this movie in theaters, I've seen it twice. Yeah,it's that good, *spoiler* especially the last fight scene against the Kraken.",10,2,5,13 July 2006
Disturbia," Big surprise
","I saw this movie last night with my buddies in a packed theater and i must say i was pleasantly surprised at how...good it was. The acting was top-notch, surprising for this type of movie. what was also surprising was how well the love story fit in with the rest of the movie. The guy from House (he played Tritter) was especially creepy as the insane Mr. Turner, one of the coolest villains i've seen in a movie. He stole every scene he was in, and Shia LeBoufe (did i spell that right?) was worlds away from Holes. Great job to everyone involved in this film.Cail's monologue about what he saw in the girl actually made me cry...haha. But yeah this movie was amazingly good, best thriller since Hitchcock (and he wrote the book).",9,1,5,22 April 2007
Blood Diamond," Superb
","Wow, 2006 had some amazingly good movies, and I am happy to report Blood Diamond was one of them. Leonardo DiCaprio was really busy this year, with this and the equally good The Departed. Blood Diamond, despite what the trailer implies, is NOT an Indiana Jones adventure rip-off movie. It is actually a touching story about a man who's son was captured by an African rebel group known as the RUF, and that man's struggle to find him. He is helped by mercenary Danny Archer, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who is only interested in finding a rare Blood Diamond that he can use to go to America. Some great action scenes, great acting, good direction and a very good ending combine to make one hell of a movie.",10,0,1,13 February 2007
Pulp Fiction," The Greatest Movie/Film Ever Made
","What's the difference between a movie and a film? A movie is purely raw entertainment, simply there to make the viewer laugh, scream, cry, or get pumped up. A film does not only this, but makes the viewer think or gain a deeper understanding of the themes in the film.Pulp Fiction is both the greatest film and movie ever made.The acting is perfect (Most actors were relatively unknown at the time, with the exceptions of Bruce Willis and Christopher Walken.) The cinematography is everything you'd expect from Quentin Tarantino, one of the most genius directors in history. This is the movie that all 90's gangster flicks wished they could be, and never will be.The three story lines intersect perfectly. Without question.Those are the film aspects, now for the movie ones: Right at the beginning, you know this movie's gonna get your blood flowing with the opening lines: 'Everybody be calm, this is a robbery!' 'Any of you f***ing b****es move, i'll execute every one of you motherf****rs!' Then it goes straight to the opening credits, perfectly pulled off with the amazing song Misirlou.And of course there's Jules' Bible passage before he kills Brent. Too awesome.The greatest movie/film ever. Period.",10,0,1,9 February 2007
Titanic," The greatest mystery of my life.
","For the past year and a half (the first time i ever REALLY saw this movie; i'd seen it when i was little and never really understood it until then) i've been pondering over one all-important question. Why does this movie have such a relatively low rating on the IMDb? The record for most Academy Awards (OScars) won by a single movie is eleven. This was only won by three movies, ever: Ben-Hur, The Lord Of the Rings: Return of the King, and Titanic. Out of those Titanic was also nominated for the most (fourteen including its wins.) LOTR:ROTK is in the top ten on the Top 250, and i know Ben-Hur is on there somewhere. If the overwhelming number of Oscar wins and nominations don't tell you enough, here' what I think: Titanic is one of the best movies i've seen. The sub-plots all tie together perfectly, the chemistry between Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing. The acting is brilliant, and the special effects are very well-done. Forgive the expression, but i laughed, i cried, and i died a little inside along with Jack. To see this movie is to see greatness. James Cameron proves that he can do non-action movies and still be a great director. 10/10.",10,1,3,25 January 2007
300," Amazing...Beautiful...Perfect
","These are only some of the words to describe Frank Miller's 300. From the start to the finish, this movie grabs you and refuses to let go. The acting is simply superb, and the plot line and script flow as naturally as Spartans kill Persians.Which leads me to the action sequences.Amazing. Stunning. The perfectly choreographed fighting gives the impression of actually being on the battlefield, it is that natural. The colors are beautiful, and the bloodsplatter is perfect.Sure, it's not historically accurate. Sure, the Persians look like goblins from Lord of the Rings. But, why don't we all take this as a movie and not as a historical documentary? If you do that, then you'll see easily the best movie of the year so far, and one of the best action movies in history.GO SEE 300!",10,2,6,10 March 2007
