Deja Vu," Best Movie I have seen in a long time....
","This has to be the best movie I have seen. The acting was great. The action was worthy of the big screen and it was so totally entertaining. I liked and enjoyed the movie very much. Movies with great plots, acting, and real action are back! Denzel and Paula were excellent leads in the movie. It kept you wondering what might happen, or what might have already happened, next. I hoped there is a sequel to this great movie. I hope they keep the time travel part of the plot in the sequel. I hope there is a sequel because I want to see more of this! I won't add any spoilers so that you all can go see it. Have a great time! Remember what I said about 'what may have already happened'.",10,1,3,22 November 2006
