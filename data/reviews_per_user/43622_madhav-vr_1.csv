The Blair Witch Project," *** Scariest movie I have ever seen ***
","This is by far the scariest horror movie ever and I have seen a lot. Intense thriller, found footage categorized, this is very realistic to the core. And the idea that there is no reveal of the 'scary characters' that is normally expected towards the movie ending makes it more realistic and scarier.During the course of the movie, you will love (or hate) the characters surely it doesn't matter but you'll get attached to what is happening out there. How many ever times I watched, it gives me a chill down my spine while watching few scenes in the movie, which I have rarely felt watching other movies in this genre.Ten stars to the makers and director!",10,2,5,14 April 2015
