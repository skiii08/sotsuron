Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A great introduction to the greatest motion picture saga ever made
","I remember when I first saw 'Star Wars: Episode One-The Phantom Menace' almost 3 years ago.  It was on opening weekend, and I can still clearly remember all of the hype surrounding this movie.  It was incredible.  I mean, everywhere you went, you saw and heard Star Wars.  Whether you were eating Taco Bell, or drinking Pepsi, you were experiencing the hype of the most wildly anticipated movie since, perhaps, 'Gone With the Wind'.  It was on the cover of every major magazine in the world, and it was the topic of every news show around the globe.    The theater I saw the film in, was, of course, packed.  When the line 'A Long Time Ago in a Galaxy Far, Far Away' appeared on the screen, I knew I was in for something special. Before I knew it, the film was over.  It ended almost as soon as it had begun, it seemed.  For a 2 hour and 10 minute film, it really went by quick.  I should probably get down to the point of the review and answer the most important questions:  Was it any good?  Is it better than the originals?  But, before I answer these questions, it should be clear to everyone that this is only the first part of the new trilogy. Two more films are coming, and truthfully, as a stand alone movie, 'The Phantom Menace' does not really hold up that well.  Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie, and it does an excellent job of introducing all of the characters that will no doubt play a more important part in Episode's 2 and 3.  It nicely sets everything in motion for the next 2 installments.    Since pretty much everyone has seen the movie, I won't dwell too much into the plot, but the best aspect of the movie is with Senator Palpatine. He secretly joins an alliance with the Trade Federation, and uses the conflict to his advantage and to gain control of the Senate, and soon, the Republic.  The events that transpire all lead to the formation of the Empire, and his control of it.  This was all done very nicely, but it should have been the main focus of the movie, not the story with Anakin.  It's very complex, and for me, it was a little too hard to understand when I first saw this movie, but now, it is as clear as day.  I just wish it hadn't been so subtle. Other parts of the movie, such as the story with Anakin and the podracing, are not as well done, but are still entertaining to watch.  It's very intriguing to learn where he came from, and while most people were put off by it, I actually liked the idea of Anakin being conceived by the Force. It's somewhat mysterious and sort of poetic.    In the end, after all was said and done, George Lucas's first installment of the new trilogy is a great set up of things to come.  It's unfair to say that this movie isn't as good as the originals.  You really can't compare one movie to a whole trilogy and expect it to stand up to it.  It's almost impossible.  But, if you want to be picky about it, I'd say it stands somewhere along the lines of 'Return of the Jedi' if you want to judge the movie by itself.  But it would be a lot smarter to wait for the other films to be released to make any kind of serious judgment.",Null,0,0,17 March 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," George Lucas tells a beautifully crafted story rich with fine acting, witty dialogue, and amazing special effects.
","Despite what critics have said, 'Star Wars: Episode II-Attack of the Clones' is a wonderful, fun filled adventure from a galaxy far, far away. There are a few problems with the script, and the acting is stiff in places, but George Lucas has, for the most part, succeeded with creating a visually compelling, dramatically focused, and very emotional film.  Much like 'The Empire Strikes Back', Lucas has dwelled into darker territory with 'Clones', as we begin to see Anakin Skywalker's inevitable descent to the Dark Side. We also get to see the beginning of the end for the Galactic Republic, and its transformation into the Empire.At 142 minutes, 'Clones' may seem like a long movie, but it moves at a ferocious speed, and it's over almost as soon as it begins.  For me, this was a bad thing.  Not enough time was given to specific scenes.  The love story between Anakin and Padme Amidala feels rushed, and loses some believability because of this.  The scenes with the Homestead on Tatooine had the potential to be great, but Owen Lars and Beru Whitesun, Luke's uncle and aunt from the original 'Star Wars', have very few lines, and their roles in this movie seem rather pointless.  I was really anxious to see this part of the film, but I was ultimately disappointed.As for the acting, it's mostly pretty good.  Ewan MgGregor does a fine job as Obi Wan Kenobi, and offers a couple of pretty good laughs during the film.  Hayden Christensen is terrific as the young Darth Vader.  He brings a lot of intensity and emotion to the role, and, at times, you can't help but feel sorry for him.  Natalie Portman is only ok with her role as Padme Amidala.  She delivers some of her lines in a dull monotone.  The rest of the cast is excellent, especially Ian McDirmid as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine.  He's devilishly sneaky and corrupted, and it's amazing to watch him in action.  Samuel L. Jackson is also back as Jedi Master Mace Windu, and, as always, he's a pleasure to watch.  Christopher Lee manages to bring us a truly memorable villain with Count Dooku, who's light years ahead of Darth Maul.  His skills with a lightsabre are incredible, to say the least.All of the technical aspects of the film are a wonder.  The special effects, the sound, everything, are fantastic.  The battle at the end of the film is truly one of the best action sequences ever put on screen.  John Williams has also given us a dazzling musical score, his best since 'Empire', I think.  The love theme is amazingly beautiful.For me, the best part of the film was the story-telling.  It's absolutely masterful.  The missing pieces of the saga begin to fall into place, as Anakin slowly begins his transformation into the evil Darth Vader, the beginning of the Clone Wars, the fall of the Republic, and the rise of the Empire.  The final sequence of the movie will no doubt send chills down your spine, as it gives you the feeling of the impending doom that's about to be unleashed upon the galaxy.Even with its faults, 'Attack of the Clones' proves that George Lucas still has it in him to create an epic story that not only offers a huge treat for the ears and eyes, but a film rich with exhilarating emotions, raw intensity, and beautifully crafted drama.Final Grade:  B+",10,0,0,16 May 2002
Black Hawk Down," A Riviting Combat Film Told With Extraordinary Power and Vision
","Before I comment about 'Black Hawk Down', I would like to address the fact that some viewers are not impressed with this film for reason such as having a lack of plot, no character development, or being too violent.  While I can agree with the fact that this movie has little character development, but saying 'Black Hawk Down' doesn't have enough plot or is too violent is too much to swallow.  This movie is a reinactment of a battle that actually took place in Oct. of '93.  While it isn't 100% accurate, it stays as true to the event as it possibly could.  This is what happened, people.  This is the story of the men who were there and what they had to endure.  There aren't supposed to be little plot gimmicks like character betrayal, and what not. I've heard of people complaining about the fact that it doesn't have a love story either.  This isn't 'Pearl Harbor' people.  This movie doesn't have to have a rediculous love story to keep it interesting.  This is what 'Pearl Harbor' should have been.  Second, this movie doesn't have to rely on character development to create an emotional connection between the audience and the characters.  We are given their names, and we've come to understand their personalities before they are thrown into the midst of battle.  What they have to face by the angry Somalian Militia is more than enough for us to care deeply about them.  We really don't need pointless info about where they grew up or what their parents were like.  Finally, some people have moaned and groaned about the amount of violence in the movie.  First of all, this isn't a Disney picture.  If you don't want to see realistic violence, go see 'Snow Dogs'.  Secondly, this is a war movie.  It portrays what soldiers have to face during battle, and sometimes violence is on that list. That's reality people, it happens during war.  What do you expect when thousands of bullets are flying is all directions?  There's going to be a very considerable amount of blood and gore.  People are going to be(SPOILERS!!!) blown in half, people are going to lose limbs, and yes, a bullet is going to rip through a leg and damage an artery.  That's the grim reality of war.  If you don't like it, don't go see a war movie.  It's as simple as that.  That aside, Ridley Scott's 'Black Hawk Down' is a masterpiece.  It is very well acted, and directed, and it's the most honest portrayal of what war is like is to date.  The score, by Hans Zimmer is classical in every sense of the word.  Its melodies are haunting yet uplifting.  It's one of Zimmer's best, bested only by his score for 'Gladiator'.  Everything else, from the camera work, to the special effects, is superb.  While I hesitate to call this the best motion picture of all time, I do feel, however, that it is the finest war picture ever made, and it is easily the best movie of 2001.",10,2,4,20 January 2002
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Full of adventure and excitement
","Star Wars: Episode 5-The Empire Strikes BackWow, it's hard for me to come up with words to describe George Lucas' epic continuation of 'A New Hope'.  It's fun, thrilling, exciting, romantic, and with all of this, it still manages to be a serious film.  There is not one thing wrong with it, not that I can find anyway.  It shouldn't be judged as a stand alone film from the series, although many consider it the best of the 3 Star Wars films.  I love it as much as I do the others.  I wish George Lucas would release these movies in the theater again, I would to see them on the big screen one last time.",Null,0,0,21 March 2002
