Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Book to Film
","Well, there may possibly be a spoiler to the readers of the book. I just went the other night to see this movie, having just finished reading the book, everything was freshly imprinted in my mind. Right from the start, i was confused, and thrown off, as it was nothing like the book at all! I had a very hard time separating the book plot from the movie plot, and many places made me grind my teeth in frustration. However, this movie was very enjoyable. I loved the action scenes were amazing as was the detail. I particularly liked the slow motion parts of the fights. Hopefully this doesn't deter and of the book readers from watching, while it's vastly different, it was still a very good movie.",8,1,2,30 June 2012
