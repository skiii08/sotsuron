The Blair Witch Project," Real horror
","Blair Witch Project isn't what you usually call 'A Classic', like The Exorcist. But it's scary as hell. The brilliant concept of filming the whole thing with just a small, blurry camera brings you closer to really experiencing a movie than to any other film in the history of film-making. They weren't trying to do any normal, pretty teen-horror-movie, this is an ugly film, and that's the way horror-films should be. Perfectly accurate camera and some overly-supernatural demon aren't going to get you even close to real horror. You know it can never happen to you. But the Blair Witch Project is very,very realistic. That's what drives a person to the brink of insanity. And the brilliant part is, that they never even show 'the Witch'. The kids just get lost in the woods and then strange things happen to them. There's not a tiny bit of supernatural activity there. Maybe the whole thing's just in their heads. Maybe they're imagining everything. Maybe not. Who knows? And we never find out what happens to them at the very end. All I know is that it's terrifying. It's a raw, psychotic, nerve-breaking film. It's real horror.",8,1,2,1 February 2005
A Clockwork Orange," Makes me want to kill myself (In a good way)
","This film is the most mind-blowing ever made. The Opening scene with first the hypnotizing red screen (incredibly powerful method) and Alex's psychotic face filling the screen and then slowly moving farther away showing all the droogs sitting completely still in the Korovo Milk Bar creates a fascinating futuristic atmosphere. However, this scene would be nothing if it wasn't for the music. It's so beautiful I can't think of anything else in the world while it's playing. It has to be the most beautiful piece of music ever written (after Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata). Funny enough, the greatest composer of all Time, Beethoven, is also a big part of the film. Being a person who lives for music, and music only, that really is the thing that makes this film absolutely Godlike. (Same thing with 2001)",10,0,1,1 February 2005
Inception," Incredible film
","Inception.. hooly hell, what a movie. I was crying with tears of laughter, or something like that. I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen for the entirety of the film -- or more like the last 1Â½ hours.Leonardo DiCaprio is great, and so are the other people in it. Marion Cotillard is beautiful, and that chick from Juno is super-sweet and funny. What can I say, I just finished watching it, and I'm simply awe-struck. I didn't like it at all in the beginning, was almost close to turning the whole thing off - luckily I didn't.Now I'm wondering if I'M real..I have nothing much to say, that's maybe a testament to the power of this film. If you haven't seen it, I recommend. You might not like it, or then love it.",9,0,5,9 January 2011
