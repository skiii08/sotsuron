Frost_Nixon," Enjoyable as a story - flawed as a representation of the truth
","I had never seen the real interview between Frost and Nixon and so came into this movie totally fresh. The story is engaging, the script enjoyable and the acting fine. At the end though, I didn't get what all the fuss was about. I didn't get a 'he said it!!' moment.The film implied that Frost had gotten Nixon to admit to something no-one else could (i.e. something illegal), thereby condemning himself to political wilderness. However, instead I was left feeling that Nixon was an OK guy - an intelligent, quick witted, sincere and strong guy who did what it took to get things done. Whereas Frost came across as a chancer, who was a bit lucky. At the end I wondered what the purpose of the movie was.I have now seen the actual footage of the interviews and can only conclude that the movie's purpose was to show Nixon in a much more favourable light than he would've come across in the real interviews - because in the real interviews, he stinks. In the real interviews you can see the panic in his face, you can see the often painfully contrived shows of friendliness in his mannerisms and you can hear the uncoordinated logic of his answers. Whereas in the movie he's smooth with his answers and his mannerisms.Any Brits out there should liken Nixon to our very own Gordon Brown - a man as bereft of any social attractiveness as Nixon. By getting Langella to play Nixon, it's like getting Alec Guiness to play Brown. I.e. a brilliant actor, but a million miles away from the truth.And THAT'S the problem with these recent 'real life' movies that focus on people in high offices of state - The Queen, The Special Relationship and now Frost/Nixon. The films make the people in high office appear to be totally articulate, very quick witted, sincere, at times funny and always strong in character and determination. Whereas the truth is anything but that. We've seen footage of a supposedly eloquent Clinton and he is anything but. We've seen the Queen deliver her speeches and 'sincerity' is never a word you'd associate with her.I know the counter argument is that it is only a movie and we shouldn't take it literally. But that's just it, by giving the film 'real' characters and 'real story' lines, the film makers are implying it is real. In fact, it is the very suggestion that it might be factual that draws the audiences in. Otherwise where would the attraction be of seeing a film about a fictional President's relationship with a fictional Prime Minster? Or a fictional queen's reaction to the death of a fictional daughter in law? There would be no attraction. So the makers have lured us paying public to part with our hard earned cash to see something that promises fact but instead delivers fiction.So yes, I enjoyed the 'story', but ended up resenting its total fiction.",5,12,19,24 February 2011
Skyfall," We've lost the reboot and gone back to the old Bond
","No! No! No! No! No! No! Mendes has taken the hard, gritty reboot from Casino Royale and gone full circle back to the light-hearted humour of the old Bond.OK, so first let's say it is a HUGE improvement on Quantum of Solace – none of that Paul Greengrass/Bourne-esque jumpy camera cuts (or whatever the technical jargon is). Also, to make Mr Silver as quite openly gay was a brave move – was it to bring the pink pound in I wonder?Then let's overlook the 'eh?' moments:  Bond is shot and falls hundreds of feet into a river and somehow survives? (eh?)  Then somehow he finds his way to some sun-kissed location without M knowing his was alive - obviously must've had a huge wad of cash handy nearby because a credit card would've revealed his identity. And that cash lasted his pain killers and drinking and then enough to get him home again (eh?)  Or how Bond can fall into a lake in the moors in Scotland, which is so cold that he can run on top of it and yet he can survive an underwater fight and still make his way to kill Silver without contracting hypothermia (eh?)  Then there's the way Mr Silver got himself out of his cell and killed 2 guards by . . . well all we saw was him stretching so god knows how he did it (eh?) Maybe we can ignore the clichés  car chase where cars crash into loads and loads of barrows and stalls etc and yet NO-ONE is seen getting injured or killed.  Bond shoots his shirt cuffs after getting off the digger on to the train. Like Brosnan adjusting his tie under water in World is Not Enough Then let's say nothing about the nods to other films or themes:  the Roger Moore alligator run  the Mission Impossible NOC listPerhaps we can let slide the inconsistent background to Bond's youth – in Casino Royale, Vesper says 'you didn't come from money and your school friends never let you forget it and you were at the school by the grace of someone else's charity hence the chip on your shoulder'. Well looking at Skyfall he DID come from money (they had a gamekeeper for chrissakes), albeit maybe it went when his parents died, but then why the chip on his shoulder? At least they kept the orphan aspect consistent.Finally, let's take for granted the fact that if all Silver needed was to be imprisoned and his laptop captured, then all he had to do was walk up to M after the bombing and say it was him. We didn't need Bond to go to Shanghai, kill an assassin, have a stupid fight in a casino, shag a girl and ultimately get her killed.All of that I can just about stomach (just about), but the ONE thing I cannot abide is the humour! There are lives at stake, both his and other's and yet he can openly make quips? No! Mendes just pandered to ignorant press comment lamenting the lack of humour since the reboot.So, I am afraid I don't give it 10 stars or even 7. I give it 5 just for Craig and the action. Oh and the last problem was the length of it, never better illustrated by the way Silver lumbered slowly and exhaustedly to the chapel. That was how I felt about the film up to that point. It was too long.",5,2,9,27 October 2012
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Tiresome action scenes - with SHAKY CAM!!!
","These super hero movies are getting tiresome. One 1 man against 100? No worries. He'll throw his shield, or hide behind it or run, leap or roll dodging every bullet known to man. Oh god, will someone please just kill him!!!! Even his own attempt at self sacrifice doesn't kill him (that's 2 movies now!). They try to balance the action out with the ethical issues being faced, but we were never really given an indication of the true horror of what is being proposed. To be honest even I was thinking, heck a few million baddies (or potential baddies) for the good of the many billion goodies? Yeah go for it. Or maybe it was because I had become desensitised by the shaky camera action scenes that just left me cold and made me want them to end as soon as possible. If you can't film action scenes without waving the camera around then you shouldn't be let loose with one.And hands up - did anyone really think he wasn't going to get the 3rd chip in place before they opened fire? Of course he was - it was pointless leaving to the final second. Oh and how convenient that the ships all fell into the water and not on top of innocent civilians.And to make things worse, there's the end credits scene setting up the next 'enthralling' instalment.",6,0,1,16 May 2014
Oblivion," Unspectacular
","Yes it is a bit of a turkey.Great scenery and effects and of course Tom. But it's just Total Recall meets Mad Max meets Waterworld meets Independence Day (and I am sure there are other 'meets' that can be found - heck I might even have found a reference to The English Patient at one point too).Olga Kurylenko is painfully short as an actress of any quality, so is just there for looks. The only actresses of any quality are Andrea Riseborough and Melissa Leo, neither of which given enough to show off their talents further.The pace of the film starts out very engaging, with the customary slow parts in between, to ensure it's not too relentless, but then it gets even slower further into the movie and I was starting to get fidgety.The actual reveal is not really that revealing - you didn't go 'oh I seeeeeeee', you just went 'Oh right OK'. So a lot of build up to nothing really.And of course it is clichÃ© ridden - just once if a child falls in mass stampede, could the heroine just keep running? And why is it sleeping together once is always absolutely certain to result in a baby? All in all, not sure why Tom signed up for it. Joseph Kosinski (Director) hasn't exactly got a good track record and this matches it.",6,74,141,10 April 2013
Salt," Too many WTF moments
","I know all this stuff about having to suspend disbelief in an action thriller, but I already made that compromise by accepting that someone as distinctively beautiful as Jolie could be a spy. No amount of disguising could ever mask those lips.So to then be assaulted by numerous examples of death defying leaps and jumps and fights and . . . oh the list goes on. We ended up laughing at each unbelievable piece of action - and when you start laughing then it is no longer an action thriller. In fact learning that Tom Cruise was originally slated to play a male version of Salt, but pulled out, makes me think he realised that it was too over the top to be taken seriously. After all he has made Knight and Day which is full of its own unbelievable action scenes, but is done in a tongue in cheek way so that the audience doesn't throw their hands up in disbelief.Overall Salt has been done before with Russian sleepers infiltrating Western society to be awoken to redress the power balance Russia's way (No Way Out immediately springs to mind) and the stunts have been done before. And even having a female agent has been done before - A Long Kiss Goodnight.One seen, immediately forgotten and never re-seen.",4,0,4,19 March 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Not really a reboot, more a rehash
","So what was the point of this so called reboot? What did it do that was anything new? The following can't really be called plot spoilers because they've all been seen in the previous Spider-man movies.Geeky kid, who is picked on? Tick.Gorgeous girl who has sympathy for geeky kid? Tick.Geeky kid bitten by spider and gets amazing powers? Tick.Geeky kid exploits new powers? Tick.Geeky kid learns that not only can he climb tall buildings, but he can jump off then too? Tick . . . now if only he had something to hold on to though . . . oh wait . . .Geeky kid develops his own seemingly endless supply of web? Tick.Uncle to geeky kid gets killed? Tick.Geeky kid goes on a rampage against all baddies? Tick.Geeky kid swings between buildings defying all laws of momentum and physics? Tick.An otherwise normally mild mannered scientist induces himself with some drug and metamorphoses into a deranged monster hell bent on conquering the world? Tick.CGI dominated battles ensue between Spider-man and said monster? Tick.Stan Lee has a cameo? Tick.Seriously with the exception that the love interest is Gwen Stacy, there is nothing new with this reboot. Batman Begins provided a good reboot of that character because the previous ones had become too comical. But this 'reboot' of Spider-man did nothing new or darker.And anyway, why is he Spider-man? Surely it should be Spider-kid or Spider-boy?",5,3,6,29 January 2013
Zero Dark Thirty," Hmm over-hyped and riding on the coat tails of Hurt Locker
","What is this film about? One woman's crusade to find and kill OBL. Why is she so determined? We don't know, we don't see any personal connection. She didn't volunteer, she was assigned. Why? Because she's a killer apparently - we only have by way of dialogue, we see nothing else to back that up, other than her determination to catch him.The first 30 or so minutes (difficult to tell, it felt a lot longer) was full of indistinguishable or undecipherable Arabic names being flung around during interrogations, questionings or in meetings in that 'realistic' way of portraying conversation i.e. you can't understand anything. Note to Directors as a whole - just because you know the names your actors are spouting in that mumbling, talking over each other way, doesn't mean that we, the audience can hear them or differentiate them. Try directing with the audience in mind next time.A lot has been said about the use of torture to illicit information and was this film sanctioning it. Well by now we're seen water boarding all over the place, in other movies and even on TV dramas. The level of torture depicted in this movie was not shocking at. I learnt nothing new about the lengths we went to try and get information. If you want to see what lengths you could possibly go to, watch The Unthinkable.And as for the Director, Hurt Locker announced her brilliantly to the movie world. I think she only got this gig because of it. Whilst everything was directed competently, she has a habit of signalling when something is going to happen.SPOILER ALERTS When the friendly source comes to the base it is obvious something is going to happen beyond what was hoped by the intelligence people.Or when our heroine is filmed leaving her apartment and exchanging pleasantries with her security guard, you knew something was going to happen, otherwise why are we seeing such detail? That said, there was one scene that took me by surprise, but maybe that was because I didn't recall the Marriott 2008 bombing.Overall I found it too long and too unclear. The only people I felt any concern for were the Canaries, and we all know they survived anyway.What have we learnt from this film? That it took one woman's tenacity to track down OBL. Is that it???? Hardly worth the effort to make it or indeed watch it.",5,9,18,27 January 2013
Arrival," Is the story too clever for my own good?
","An opinion on a movie can depend on so many variable factors:<ul><li>Have I seen a preview? Yes</li></ul><ul><li>Have I heard a review/opinions of others? Yes</li></ul><ul><li>Do I have a hangover? No</li></ul><ul><li>Have I just eaten a big dinner? Over 2 hours ago</li></ul><ul><li>Is the cinema full? No, just 3 people.</li></ul><ul><li>Is the cinema full of noise makers? For once no.</li></ul><ul><li>Are the screen and sound system big enough to immerse myself? It was a small auditorium, so not a large screen or sound system</li></ul>And too many more factors to list.The reason for mentioning them? Because one or more or all of them must have affected my enjoyment of this movie, because I thought it was OK, but nothing special - when it seems everyone else thinks it is a master piece. To be honest, I even closed my eyes on a couple of occasions. It suffered from taking a very short story and trying to stretch it into nearly 2 hours. Which naturally creates huge empty spaces which need to be filled with something more than just beautiful scenery or empty dialogue. The language angle was good - the possibility of misinterpreting messages and intentions. But at no point did I sense any jeopardy from making any mistakes. Even if the humans attacked the 'Aliens' where was the certainty that they would retaliate? There had been no previous show of aggression. In fact 'jeopardy' was lacking in all interactions. We see a previous person being carted off after interacting with the aliens - what happened to him/her? When our guys interact with the aliens I sensed no risk or threat. So why the predecessor had to be carted off is beyond me.And of course it committed the cliché of depicting America as the world's peace keeper, China as the world's aggressor and Russia as the brutal nation which executes one of their own. And then there are plot holes:<ul><li>Are we really expected to accept that these 'aliens' suddenly arrived completely undetected in their approach, placed themselves in 12 apparently random locations (that happily included America) and then spent months in dialogue with lots of so called linguistic specialists, none of whom could have enough common sense to work together. </li></ul><ul><li>They came to us to give us a gift and yet made it almost impossible to communicate it? Surely if they had the power of foresight they would've known that communication was key and would have worked something out? And what will be happening in 3,000 years that we will help them out with?</li></ul>Like I said in my summary, maybe it was too clever for me. Maybe I need to see it again to 'get it'. But frankly I have no desire to sit through it again.",5,1,6,3 December 2016
Godzilla," Darker than previous 1998 version - but in more ways than one
","The plus point is that this film had more dramatic development than the previous 1998 version. But then again other re-re-booted movies have also adopted this approach - Man Of Steel, Amazing Spiderman, Incredible Hulk. The problem they all have is that it is just a pre-amble to the inevitable over the top action sequences. And in the case of Godzilla, action sequences that are done in darkness so you can barely see what is happening. It might have been the 3D glasses making it darker than it would be in 2D, but the detail just wasn't there. Godzilla and the MUTOs were apparently going hammer and tongs at each other, but I couldn't sense the extent to which they were injuring each other (until the final atomic breath climax). We've all grown up with the original impact of the jaw dropping moment we saw dinosaurs come to life in Jurassic Park. This movie added nothing more in terms of impact of the last 21 years of development since Jurassic Park (Godzilla even sounded like T-Rex). The human peril element is handled in 2 ways (i) intimate focus (on the train or in the rubble) where those who do perish are mere unknowns, so long as our heroes survive or (ii) detached focus (buildings being knocked down as the monsters fight) where you assume all occupants are dead (or conveniently trapped safely under the previously mentioned rubble). And as for our heroes - there was no acting. No development of character. They just provided the human forefront to the monsters back drop.What I also found confusing was that Godzilla was hailed a hero for destroying the MUTOs and applauded as he walked back indiscriminately through the rubble and dead bodies that he had helped create. The end was the usual cliché - family reunion that you could predict a mile off. Did the director really think 'people will want to know that the family are re-united, so I'll draw it out'. Oh come on, I found my empty popcorn box more appealing at that point. Can this please please please be the last of these movies? Please please do not feel the need to develop a sequel.",6,1,8,16 May 2014
Cloud Atlas," It's just 3 hours of playing 'Who's that in disguise?'.
","Right from the start you play the game of trying to identify who the famous actor is underneath all the prosthetics - 'Ooh that's Tom Hank' or 'Is that really Hugh Grant?' or 'Can that possibly be Halle Berry?' etc etc. All this disguising of nationality, race and gender is all very clever, but unfortunately it's just self indulgence on the actors' parts and gets in the way of listening to what they are saying.That is assuming you could even understand what they're saying in the first place. The language on the Big Island is a prime example, which appears at the very beginning and sets the tone of unintelligible mishmash for the rest of the film. And if your movie is going to be so complicated in its telling, then you really should do us all a favour and make it easy to understand what's being said. Yet another example of directors assuming that because they know what they're actors are saying then we all will - you only know because you told them what to say in the first place! Having mentioned the prosthetics, I also have to call into question the quality of the make up - especially in Neo Seoul, where the attempts to make Western actors look Far Eastern was laughable - almost as laughable as the attempt to make Doona Bae looked Western by giving her red hair and freckles.So, on top of distracting disguises, poor make-up and indecipherable dialogue, then you have the problem of telling 6 stories in parallel. This means we never get the time to invest any emotion into the plight of the characters (possibly with the exception of Sonmi~451) so really I didn't care what happened to them. Ewing? Didn't care. Frobisher? Didn't care. Rey? Didn't care. Cavendish? Didn't care - and anyway what was the point of this element of the story?I have just read the plot overview on Wikipedia and can tell that either the directors cut bits out of the movie or the problems with spoken language made it impossible to pick up on certain aspects that MAY have made this a more enjoyable movie.In conclusion, nearly 3 hours of butt numbing, sleep inducing, self indulgent multiple role playing with no regard for the audience.Oh and finally, Susan Sarandon's teeth in the Big Island! They're all living in straw huts with no technology or medicine and yet Susan Sarandon's got the most amazingly white teeth! Do directors actually look at what they directing?",5,2,4,5 March 2013
Spectre," Mendes is scared to continue the direction set by Casino Royale
","You reboot a franchise because it has become old, tired and boring. When the reboot is a huge success, you should continue in that direction (just look at Batman). What is the point of ignoring the changes and taking it back to what it was?Mendes seems hell bent on doing this. Skyfall was bad enough but I allowed him this because it was the 50th anniversary of Bond, so maybe he felt obliged to reference every previous Bond movie and play out all the old clichés . Therefore, I had hoped that now he would get us back on the track set by Casino Royale, but alas no. Firstly, he continues his nods to previous Bond movies - Live and Let Die, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, Moonraker and I could keep going. Which itself becomes an unwelcome distraction as you mentally note that you've seen this before in an earlier Bond movie and bemoan the lack of originality.Secondly, he continues the clichés of the old Bond franchise: the room of baddies around a table with the head baddie dispatching the vocal dissenter. The comedy moments in the middle of life or death situations (i.e. the Fiat 500). The signposted gadget that you're just waiting for him to use . . . oh wait he must use it here, yup thought so. The succumbing of women to just his look, no verbal jousting just taking what he wants and they let him - what decade are we living in?If I put these to one side and assess the actual film itself, it's beautifully shot and has a good single track shot in the opening sequence. Which makes it all the more galling that the helicopter fight scene has such poor CGI. It already looks fake and will look even worse as time goes on. In fact it was as poor as the CGI in the opening sequence in Skyfall on the rooftops. How can the same director get it wrong twice? Then we have the villain. When I first saw Christoph Waltz in Inglorious Basterds, I felt his menace. Which made me long to see how menacing he could be in Spectre. He was about as menacing as a wet fish. In fact Mendes did to him what he managed to do with Javier Bardem. He was a silent menace in No Country For Old Men and then became a camp psycho in Skyfall with no menace at all. Again how can the same director get it wrong twice? As for the action scenes - well Mendes managed to put a tick in the box that said 'insert action scenes here', but that was all he did. The plane scene (BTW where'd he get an airplane from in the first place???) was lacklustre. The car chase - in an empty Rome (really????) just seemed to show off 2 beautiful cars. The train scene - where was everybody? The train seemed bereft of staff or passengers. As for the final scene, well by then I'd lost any interest.Daniel Craig is the best Bond ever. He isn't pretty or particularly handsome, but he looks like he could handle himself in a fight and most men would love to be him. Which makes it such a shame he is being wasted in this box ticking exercise. I hope (no I pray - and I'm not religious) that the next Bond brings us back on the track set by Casino Royale.",6,15,43,28 October 2015
