Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Work Of Art
","The visual effects and scenery in this movie were amazing which probably goes without saying. The story is well thought out and definitely makes you wonder about the possible plot twist for the next two movies. The action was spectacular and the intentional addition of humor was a refreshing change. Unfortunately Darth Maul's character to me was rather disappointing. Not that he's not a great looking character and an awesome fighter, but I just wanted more of an actual character. He will never even compare to the popularity of Vader. As for Anakin though... the young boy who played this character made Mark Hamil's Luke Skywalker (from episode 4) look even more like a whiny little brat. A very good character who would interest me even if I didn't know his fate. I am definitely looking forward to the next two episodes.",10,0,0,19 May 1999
