Hereditary," Very, very good surprise
","One of the best horror movies I've seen In a while, and I see a lot of them. But this isn't only about horror. There is always a kind of mix of drama and mistery that only unfolds in the very end of the movie, and then it all makes sense. I won't go into details, but this really is a surprisingly good, intense and scary movie. Recomended.",8,1,3,26 August 2018
