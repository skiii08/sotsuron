Catch Me If You Can," Brilliant
","A fascinating story made more so by the fact that it is based on actual events in the life of an actual person. Leonardo DiCaprio shines in this film - his first complete display of the truly sophisticated acting for which he has now come to be known, playing Frank Abagnale Jr.'s youthful awkwardness & uncertainty seamlessly beneath his cunning conman facade. Tom Hanks plays the perfect foil, giving his character believable tenacity, smarts, and the gritty pallor of a long-suffering public servant. The score was just wonderful - and the cinematography is easy to overlook in a story as compelling as this, but it would not have been so compelling without it.Brilliantly played & written, based on an utterly fascinating life. I can't recommend this film highly enough.",10,2,3,15 May 2007
Moulin Rouge!," God Awful.
","I hate to pan a film, but I find it utterly mind-boggling that this film found an audience at all. Some people seem to love it, as the other ratings bear out, but still, I must disagree.The acting was laughable, despite the talent of the cast, and the singing was painfully bad. The best that can be said about this it is that it was somewhat visually interesting, but that isn't nearly enough to carry a film. The plot (loosely based on Camille) was virtually nonexistent, allowing the soundtrack to carry the story. Perhaps if the singing wasn't so bad, that might have worked, but in this case, it did NOT.This film was so bad that I couldn't see it all the way through. It's the only film I've ever walked out on.",1,2,6,19 May 2007
Pulp Fiction," Everyone should see this at least once.
","I'm not the biggest fan of Quentin Tarantino, I find his dialog to be a bit tedious at times, but he did VERY well on this film. Some of the dialog & situations are a bit silly, and some of the dialog runs on for a little too long, but it's not so bad that it's distracting, and as I said, it's what one expects from Tarantino. It's still entertaining.The most remarkable thing about this movie for me is the way the independent story lines converge & diverge effortlessly. THAT was brilliant. Unfortunately he's used this mechanism before, to lesser degrees, but it really worked so well this time.The cast was nothing short of brilliant, really - I don't say this lightly. There are too many brilliant moments for me to try to isolate the brightest performance - even the supporting cast was brilliant. To remove or alter one performance would diminish the overall experience. It's incredibly rare in film that a cast of this size would be so consistently good.You may not care for the at-times dark subject matter, you may not care for the fact that it doesn't have a pronounced point of story resolution at the end, you may not care for the excessive cursing, but you will enjoy this movie immensely.",9,0,2,19 June 2007
The Terminal," Fascinating, funny & touching.
","Though the story is utterly unbelievable, the execution is sublime. Hanks portrays Viktor Navorsky as a kind, honorable & gentle soul, who is both adaptive & inventive - it's wonderful to watch the creative solutions he comes to to counted the obstacles places before him. Stanley Tucci plays a complete b@st@rd so beautifully, the film would have been a failure without him. The love story was the weakest part of the script, unfortunately Catherine-Zeta Jones' love interest character didn't sparkle as some of the other characters did, indeed it was the only weak link in this story, but it's important to state that it was weak only in contrast to the other characters. Kumar Pallana and Diego Luna's supporting roles were played to perfection, Tom Hanks, Stanley Tucci & Chi McBride were all wonderful. And there is NO objectionable subject matter or language, making this a must-see movie, for all ages.",10,1,3,15 May 2007
