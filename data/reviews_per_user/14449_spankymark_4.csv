Blade Runner 2049," The sequel the first film deserved
",Blade Runner (1982 ) was literally faultless. You can't improve on the original because it was simply perfection. However you can hope for a worthy sequel. And this is it. Everything works. Even the astonishing soundtrack. It's what fans have been waiting for for forty years.,10,2,13,12 October 2018
Monster," Theron is astonishing
","Every now and again an actor doesn't simply act their part , they become that person. Theron is simply astonishing in her portrayal of Wuornos .It is faultless on every level and should be considered one of the finest performances of all time. The day she won that oscar I literally jumped for joy.",10,1,1,2 May 2019
2001: A Space Odyssey," The birth of modern sci-fi
","This film hailed the birth of modern sci-fi on film. Within one fell swoop gone were the bacofoil costumes, green bug eyed men , damsels in distress and stupid whiny music. This movie shattered the genre's silly portrayal ok screen and ushered in the true essence of science fiction. Shock. Awe. Wonder and weirdness. It is THE seminal sci-fi film. Can you IMAGINE walking into the cinema and watching this after being used to black and white flying saucers wobbling on strings ? It still gives shivers to its audience FIFTY years on. Place a Space Shuttle next to the Wright Brothers' plane. Then you'll get some idea of what this film did to cinema.",10,1,1,6 September 2018
A Clockwork Orange," Faultless
","An absolute masterpiece on every level. Dystopian science fiction 101. 
This is how you do it. 
Fifty years old and still as relevant , exciting, shocking and awe inspiring as it was half a century ago. It's timeless , peerless and faultless. Literally one of those films you have to see before you die. Kubrick's masterpiece. There's nothing like it.",10,1,2,27 August 2018
