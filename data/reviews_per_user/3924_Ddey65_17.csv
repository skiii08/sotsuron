Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Revisionism you can sink your teeth into (Yes, I went there!).
","Far too often people make up lies about America's political idols ranging from the founding fathers to President Obama. In many cases it's an attempt to undermine what we stand for, while in others it's wishful thinking. In this case it's a premise that's so fantastic and ridiculous, you can't help but enjoy it.This version of 'Honest Abe's' story begins when Abe Lincoln was a boy living a life as a child laborer with his parents for Jack Barts, a sadistic boss who tries to kidnap and whip a black friend of his and sell him as a slave. Rejecting his dad's advice to 'look away,' he attacks his boss, and the family is fired. That night he goes after his mother, and when he wakes up he sees her apparently dying of small pox (actually 'milk poisoning,' but we're not looking for historic accuracy here), but he knows that Barts is responsible for his death somehow. Years later as Abe enters adulthood for the first time, he vows revenge against his family's boss for the murder of his mother and gets drunk at a bar before killing him in order to give himself the courage to do so. Much to his surprise, his old boss can't be killed because he's one of the undead, specifically a vampire. But one man saves his life and nurses him back to health, then explains tells him what Barts really is. That man is Henry Sturgess, and Abe seeks his training to defeat the monster who killed his mother.Sturgess warns him not to make any friends or seek the spotlight, something which fate has unfortunately made impossible. He also sends him to Springfield, Illinois where he takes a job as a shopkeeper run by Joshua Speed. During his time in Springfield, he slays a few vampires and meets the woman who would later become Mary Todd Lincoln, played by the obviously miscast Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Winstead is far too pretty to play Mrs. Lincoln. Hell, even Sally Field in her current state is too pretty to play Mrs. Lincoln. He also has a casual encounter with Stephen Douglas, the man he would later debate over the abolition of slavery. And once again, he is reunited with his old black childhood friend William Johnson, who is part of the underground railroad and fleeing bounty hunters who intend to sell him and the people he has been setting free.Before killing the monster who made Abe's life a living hell, he reveals that Sturgess is a vampire too. Upon this discovery, Sturgess reveals that Adam, the man who made him the vampire he is killed his fianc√©, and he's as determined to kill them as Abe, but can't do it because vampires can't kill their own.As the country moves closer to Civil War, the vampires of the new world become more of a threat to the country, and to Lincoln himself. They kidnap Johnson, and Lincoln reveals his secret life to Speed so they can rescue him from the Adam's New Orleans plantation. Adam tries to make a deal with him to slay Sturgess instead, and naturally he rejects the deal as both rescued. According to this movie, Willie Lincoln died not from Typhoid, but from an attack by a vampire woman, and an associate of Adam at that. It's then that Mary discovers the truth about the her husband. Additionally, the north almost lost the Battle of Gettysburg because the Confederate Army had vampires as volunteers. I don't think I'm going to reveal too much else, because real history is already known. But the way this movie, and the book on which it is based blends the supernatural into real history makes it quite the tale, especially in the way it integrates Abe's determination to wipe out slavery with vampires. It has been pointed out on many occasions that as Lincoln, Benjamin Walker looks a lot like Liam Neeson. But as Adam, Rufus Sewell is reminiscent of William Campbell in his days in that Star Trek episode 'The Squire of Gothos.' Try thinking of that reference.",Null,0,1,28 April 2013
Ed Wood," Bela Lugosi: Romanian, or Hungarian?
","When Martin Landau did Bela Lugosi's trademark hypnotic hand gesture, he revealed the secret of it to Ed Wood, as being 'double-jointed' and 'Hungarian.'  Bela Lugosi was born in Romania, but anybody with an adequate amount of knowledge of central europe, also knows that parts of Romania contain a significant population of ethnic-Hungarians, most of which live in...TRANSYLVANIA!(No Joke!).Throughout Romanian history there has been strife between the two peoples, in fact, during WW2, Adolf Hitler took the Transylvanian province away from Romania and gave it to Hungary. So if Lugosi was an ethnic-Hungarian, then maybe that line wasn't a goof after all.If anybody has any comments on this issue, feel free to speak up...and correct me, if you must.",Null,0,0,26 December 1998
American Pie," What old teen movie does this REALLY remind you of?(Possible Spoilers)
","A lot of people, especially IMDb users have been comparing this movie to 'Porky's.' I say it's more like another teen movie made in the same year, specifically 'The Last American Virgin(1981),' albeit with a much happier ending. For example, all four friends succeded at their goal of losing their virginity by/on prom night, two of which with someone they truly loved. Nobody got their girlfriends pregnant, accused them of being whores, or took them to the abortion mills. The 1950's neo-greaser attitudes towards sex is missing here, and that suits me just fine. Alyson Hanigan is not as annoying as some might believe, playing the role of Michelle(..named after 'Meyrink,' perhaps?), the nerdy-flutist, who's only life outside of school is at band camp. What a pity, until you find out what else she does with her flute in her spare time. I was as 'antsy' as she was, after hearing that line, even though I should've seen it coming. 
Well worth watching for teenagers and all those who are over their teen years too.",7,0,0,20 May 2000
Radio," If for nothing else, see it for the big-screen debut of Sarah Drew.
","Ed Harris stars as high school football coach Harold Jones, who takes in a mentally retarded African-American man, who probably missed out on school back when the south was segregated, even though it wouldn't have made a difference in his case. His daughter is played by Sarah Drew, and until now there were two kinds of people who knew who she is: Recent theater buffs and Daria fans who know her as the voice of Stacy Rowe. Like a certain IMDB user from North Carolina, I saw it strictly for that reason. The movie is unfortunately predictable, but not necessarily intolerable. Cuba Gooding Jr. doesn't overplay James Robert 'Radio' Kennedy the way you'd expect an actor to do in such a role. His gullibility in the face of high school pranks is easily expected, and just as painful to watch. There's no mention of how his father died, so unless you actually read the Sports Illustrated article this movie is based on(which I didn't), you can only guess that since it takes place in South Carolina, he might've been lynched by the Ku Klux Klan. Harris' speech to Drew on why he's the kind of person who helps the unfortunate is also mumbled. I'm going to have to use the closed captioning device when I rent it on DVD. I also wonder if Debra Winger(Coach Jones' wife) coached Cuba Gooding Jr. in playing retarded people since she did so in 1993's 'A Dangerous Woman,' even though I have nothing to base this assumption on. Still, it's no 'Forrest Gump,' but at least it's not as appalling as having to sit through Juliette Lewis in 'The Other Sister.'",4,0,0,17 November 2003
Being John Malkovich," Weirder than Crispin Glover's first record
","Warning: Leave your brain at the door for this one.    Those of you who have a copy of Crispin Glover's 1989 album 'The Big Problem, is approximately equal to The Solution. The Solution=Let it Be,' or are even remotely familiar with it, know that it was the weirdest record ever made, and for at least ten years, nobody could imagine anyone from Hollywood coming out with something as weird as this. Then came the movie 'Being John Malkovich,' which along with 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective(1994),' 'El Mariachi(1992),' and 'Welcome to the Dollhouse(1995),' should be listed in Citadel Press's Films of the Nineties book(See my comment on 'Ace Ventura:Pet Detective' for this reference).  Upon seeing this film, it's expected that many would ask; Why did they choose John Malkovich? Couldn't they have chosen some other 'scary celebrity,' like Christopher Walken, Anthony James, Richard Lynch, John Saxon, Dennis Hopper, or even Crispin Glover? Was Mickey Rourke throwing too many punches on the set? Did John Lithgow mellow out after '3rd Rock from the Sun?' But then you realize, that if they were chosen, the same questions would be asked, and you'd get back to enjoying the film as it is. Like many, I didn't recognize Cameron Diaz at first. I originally thought the female lead was Kyra Sedgwick, until I saw an announcer on Entertainment Tonight put this notion away for me.
 All in all, this is just an elaborate version of those public service announcements that we saw as kids, trying to tell us to be ourselves, instead of somebody we're not. But it's still worth seeing. Looney as it may be, it deserves an Oscar, not in spite of it's weirdness, but because of it.",8,0,0,24 March 2000
Enchanted," So sweet, you'd think it would make you sick... but it doesn't.
","When I read that Harry Knowles, the founder of 'Aintitcoolnews.com' apparently never heard of Amy Adams before this movie, I was flabbergasted, because a known movie-geek like him with his own website rivaling IMDb never heard of her, and yet I still remember her as the sex-starved Marvel Ann in 'Psycho Beach Party.' I also remember some trailers & promos earlier in the year indicating she was going to play the princess in this movie, and from what I heard about it, I thought it was going to be mildly amusing. What I didn't expect was to fall head over heels for her character, her movie, and her.The evil Queen Narissa(Susan Sarandon) of Andalasia wants to do everything she can to keep her son Prince Edward(James Marsden) from finding love, because that means he will marry the girl of his dreams and she'll have to give up her throne. Gee, I can't imagine why, since Queen Elizabeth II hasn't given up her throne whenever her kids got married. Anyway, in the fairy-tale world of Andalasia, couples can fall in love in a day, and sweet girl like Giselle can summon animals with a song to her hollow tree-house, and land in the arms of the prince of her dreams while trying to flee from a troll that was going to eat her. Also, wicked queens can transform themselves into dragons or old hags and trick blushing brides into making it easier to push them into seemingly bottomless water fountains.The Queen tells her minion, and would-be lover(Timothy Spall) that she sent Giselle to a world where there are no happy endings... ours. Specifically contemporary Times Square in New York City. What a wimp! If that queen wanted to send her to a real nightmare, she should've pushed Giselle into the Times Square of the 1970's! Either way, when she arrives in the no longer animated world, she finds out just how rotten things can be. Meanwhile, a single father named Robert Phillip(Patrick Demsey) who works as a divorce lawyer tries to convince his six-year-old daughter Morgan(Rachel Covey) that she should accept the upcoming marriage to his girlfriend, Nancy(Idina Menzel). Suddenly, they stumble upon this apparently disturbed young woman in a funny-looking outfit trying to get into a billboard shaped like a castle. Yes, I'm talking about Giselle, the pretty young thing who was on the verge of marrying into Andalasian royalty. Originally, he just wants to call a cab to send her to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, but something about this kooky-lady intrigues him, so he let's her stay for the night.The next morning, our would-be princess decides to tidy his apartment up by summoning rats, mice, cockroaches, and pigeons, inadvertently convinces his would-be fianc√© to think he's having an affair with another woman, makes a new dress out of the man's curtains, and upon learning about the concept of divorce, desperately convinces a splitting couple to get back together. Fortunatley, this couple doesn't have a violent relationship, because if they did, one partner would be in serious trouble. At the same time, Prince Edward and Giselle's squirrel-friend Pip dives into the well to rescue the Princess, and Narissa coaxes her minion into trying to stop them. And all three have as hard of time adjusting to the real world as Giselle. When Robert tries to send her into Central Park with some money for a trip to wherever, she gives it away to an old lady feeding pigeons, and he joins her for a stroll to discuss the way love really works. From there, Giselle bursts out into song on cue. When a calypso band joins her in the song, Robert's reply is 'How do you all know this song? I've never heard this song before!' If he came to my house, he'd hear a lot of songs he never knew existed before, and so would you. Soon enough, all of Central Park joins her performance. And to think last night, they were writing her off as a crazy lady in a funny costume, like Robert is. After all, the girl is certifiable... certifiably adorable.In a flop-house apparently in Harlem, Prince Edward & Nathaniel discover television, including soap operas with former Disney characters as members of the cast. I like how a line from the soap makes Nathaniel doubt the morality of the mission the queen sent him on. It's also hard to ignore how the real world rubs off on Giselle, and some aspects of Andalasia inadvertently begin to effect Robert's fianc√© Nancy.Still, it's Amy Adams that makes the movie worth watching, despite the fact that her cutesy voice is as fake as hell. Very little can be said about her as Giselle that hasn't been said before. She's so sweet, she makes Stacy Rowe look like Sandi Griffin(I just can't get away from those 'Daria' references, can I?). Whereas Jennifer Garner was a delight in a non-delightful movie like '13 Going On 30,' Adams is a delight in an equally delightful movie. Absolutely not to be missed.",7,2,4,31 December 2007
Remember the Titans," Would be a better movie if it were true.
","In 1969, there was a survey taken that rated the majority of Americans' opinion of the Ku Klux Klan as being more despicable than the Viet Cong. Yet judging by the inability of many communities of the 1970's to accept integrated schools, such a sentiment would seem hard to believe. I passed up numerous chances to watch this movie, and when I finally saw it on The Disney Channel(of all places), I realized I missed a good one. Boston and Detroit weren't the first battlegrounds for school integration in the 1970's, but even if Alexandria, Virginia wasn't one of them, southern cities were just as hostile towards it as they were in the 1950's and '60's. I had a glowing review planned for this movie until I saw some of the user comments here, and I almost changed my mind.Denzel Washington plays as Herman Boone, an African-American coach, hired on the basis of affirmative action who faces a great deal of resentment for it, especially from former coach Bill Yoast(Will Patton), who is demoted to defensive coach. From the beginning, Boone makes it clear that he's a coach first, and not that much of an activist. Yoast's football-crazed daughter(Hayden Paneittiere), is such an outstanding character, that if this wasn't at least loosely based on a true story, you'd have to make someone like her up.Needless to say, most of the kids don't get along with each other, but Boone is determined to make sure that ends at training camp, and it does, which nearly creates a rift between first string Q.B. Gerry Bertier(Ryan Hurst), and his girlfriend(Kate Bosworth). What we eventually learn is that there's a sinister plot to make sure the integration fails both on the team and at school in general. Boone finds that he can't lose a single game or else he's fired. So, being the determined coach that he is, he wins every single game. However Yoast finds his white friends are plotting to revoke his membership in the local hall of fame if he doesn't agree to let them dump Boone, so they rig the next game.Big Julius(Wood Harris) sounds a great deal like Mr. T when he tells an opposing player, that he'd better get used to being on the ground.As Louie Lastik, Ethan Suplee does a complete 180-degree reversal from his role in 'American History X(1998)' as a kid from New Jersey who LOVES black culture! This is a kid who knows segregation is stupid and pointless. If he were a kid of anytime since the late-1980's he'd be the kind of kid who drives a pimped-out full-size sedan with huge speakers and chrome dubs.I don't think the movie suggested that Sunshine(Kip Pardue) really was a homosexual, but that his fellow students just taunted him simply because he was such a hippie. Aside from this, I can't really say anything about this movie that hasn't been said before. Even if the events of this movie didn't exactly take place the way the movie depicted, it was still memorable and glorious, clich√©s or no clich√©s.",6,1,1,12 April 2006
Cars," After this, Disney & Pixar are one.
","It should be no surprise to those who know me(including some on the internet who've never met me) that I'd see this movie. 1)I'm a certifiable car freak. 2)I've had a long-standing interest in animation. 3)This is officially the last Disney/Pixar collaboration. Disney now OWNS Pixar. 4)This may be the last Paul Newman movie, and even if you're not a big Paul Newman fan, any film buff should understand the merit of that.Lightning McQueen(Owen Wilson), who surprisingly was not named after Steve McQueen, is a cocky as hell hotshot rookie NASCAR racer who thinks he's so good, he doesn't even listen to his pit crew when they insist he should get his tires replaced. He has a huge ego, some loyal groupies, a sponsor he doesn't believe in, an agent who talks to him on a videophone from his trailer, and an eye on the finish line. Luckily he gets that along with his two rivals, the aging King(voiced by real life NASCAR racer Richard Petty), a 1970 Plymouth Roadrunner Superbird, and Chick Hicks(Michael Keaton) a Mid-1980's Buick GNX, who loves to push other cars around on the track. This means a tie-breaker race has to take place, and so it's on to California. His only friend at this point is his transporter Mack(John Ratzenberger), a Super Liner who hauls him to every race in the Piston Cup Series(They're obviously not going to use a real-life tobacco company for a kids' movie), but even Lightning won't let him rest when he needs it. When Mack falls asleep on the way to L.A., and is startled by a gang of street rods in the middle of the night, Lightning falls out of the trailer and gets lost. Lacking real headlights, he tries to get back on the interstate, and gets tangled in some telephone wires in a town called Radiator Springs, and wrecks their main road -- the famous U.S. Route 66. Radiator Springs was founded by a Stanley Steamer, and the statue erected in his honor is among the casualties. The town sentences him to community service, forcing him to repair the road by towing some old paving equipment. While there, McQueen is arrested by the Sheriff(author and cultural guru Michael Wallis), a 1949 Mercury, impounded by Mater(Larry the Cable Guy), a Chevy 3800 Tow Truck, prosecuted by Sally Carerra(Bonnie Hunt) a cute Porsche 911 who also owns the Cozy Cone Motel, and judged by Doc(Paul Newman), a 1951 Hudson Hornet. While there he starts to fall for the very girl who prosecuted him. During this time she takes the opportunity to show him the world around the town. She also gives him an education about the history of Radiator Springs, and he finds out something very interesting about Judge Doc Hudson. What happened to the fictional town of 'Radiator Springs' is what happened to many of the towns that ran along the former US 66 in real life. The Interstate Highway System passed them by, specifically I-40, I-44, and I-55, and the towns went bust. Although, truth be told, an interest in the former Mother Road by nostalgia buffs and roadgeeks such as myself, has lead to an increase in tourism to these areas. To be fair, I think the federal government wanted the Interstates to benefit these towns too. So even after this movie, you still won't catch me shouting 'Damn the Interstate.' In fact, I'd love to see a couple of them built across Long Island Sound(I-287 & I-495), along with some other highways.What makes this so good isn't the fact that it has motor vehicles as characters. Those kinds of cartoons were around before they ran cartoons on television. It's that the movie actually has good background scenes, especially the road scenes, whether it's on Route 66 or the Interstate on the way to California. Even the 'natural' scenes are cool, some of which are rock formations shaped like cars of the 1930's and others are modeled after the famous Cadillac Ranch. I also like how the Los Angeles Memorial Colesium was converted into the 'Los Angeles International Speedway.' To be honest, I was looking for a different ending with similar results. But 'Doc Hollywood' rip-off or not, it's still an enjoyable movie, even if 'The Incredibles' was better.",6,3,6,10 September 2006
JFK," Communist Propaganda
","While I'm not ready to dismiss all conspiracy theories related to the assassination of the 35th President of the United States, I find this one, and others like it to be an outrageous piece of communist propaganda, in fact, one of the most blatantly distorted views of the world in film history, right up there with 'Birth of a Nation'(1915),' Triumph of the Will(1935),' 'I Am Cuba(1964),' and 'The People's War in Laos(1971).' The idea that Kennedy wanted to give up the war in Vietnam, and the so-called 'evidence' that Oliver Stone uses to back that notion up is loaded with holes.For one thing, the TV news footage at the beginning, where Kennedy says...'it's their war,' also included him standing by his commitment to defend South Vietnam, and the rest of Southeast Asia from the threat of communism, which was deliberately left out. What he also ignores is the fact that Kennedy only pulled a small number of troops out in 1963, in order to scare the scare Ngo Dinh Diem out of his own repression, and not because he wanted to turn the region over to the reds. Like most presidents during the cold war, he knew that North Vietnam wasn't only a threat to the south, but to Laos & Cambodia as well. Otherwise they never would've armed the Pathet Lao & Khmer Rouge, which proves that THIS WAS NOT A CIVIL WAR.In an interview in some magazine, Oliver Stone claimed that if Kennedy had never been shot, 'The Massacre in Southeast Asia would never have happened.' Sorry, Ollie, But it would've happened no matter who was president, because the USSR, Red China, and North Vietnam all made it happen.",Null,3,16,7 April 1999
Schindler's List," Hard to Watch
","There are two reasons that I didn't like Schindler's List: One was that even though Oskar Schindler saved the lives of so many Jews, and others that the Nazis were preparing for the gas chambers, he decided who lived and who died just like they did. The other reason, is that I personally have an aversion to movies about the holocaust, because it makes me so mad, that every time I see it, whether it's from genuine stock footage, or staged for movie sets, like this one, I feel like barging into the screen like John Rambo, and shooting every brownshirt in sight, which is the same feeling I get when I see TV news footage of the more recent Serbian Holocaust against non-Serbs in the former Yugoslavia. I know that wasn't the point of the film, but these facts still bother me.  After the world finally learned how bad Nazi Germany was, we all promised that we'd never let anything like this happen again. Unfortunately, it already has happened more than several times on six continents, and continues in some countries to this day.",4,3,11,24 March 2000
The Incredibles," One of the last Disney/Pixar collaborations, so see it while you can.
","Computer Generated animation doesn't thrill people as much as it used to. Any local podunk advertising agency can make them, and has. Innovators such as Pixar have helped keep Disney afloat since the 1990's, but the recent rift between the two companies has put movies like 'The Incredibles' at risk of never seeing the light of day. Fortunately, there's still the chance of seeing it in the theaters as of this writing. For me, this wasn't the only reason to see it though. Two other reasons were that the trailers simply looked hilarious, and that one member of the sound crew(Dan Wallin) also did work on one of my favorite movies of the 1960's -- UP THE DOWN STAIRCASE(1967)! That was it, I was sold.Bob Parr(Craig T. Nelson) is Mr. Incredible, a former superhero who like many others faced an onslaught of public hostility for unintended consequences of trying to save people's lives, and has to be put under government protection. Luckily he has someone to fall back on, like Elasti-girl(Holly Hunter), who he marries and makes into Helen Parr. Fifteen years later, Bob has three kids, a job as an insurance adjuster, the urge to do good, and the knowledge that he has to keep his powers under wraps. Two of his kids know they have powers as well. Violet(Sarah Vowell) who looks like Winona Ryder in the late-1980's, only uses her invisibility to dodge a boy she has a crush on, but otherwise could do without them. Dash(Spencer Fox) who can't wait to join the track team, because he knows that with his super-speed he'll kick butt. Little baby-boy Jack-Jack doesn't have any powers, or at least the Parr family doesn't think he does.At night the former Mr. Incredible spends his time with his old buddy Lucius Best, a.k.a. Frozone(Samuel L. Jackson) where they listen to a police scanner in one of their cars and secretly perform heroic deeds in town. After witnessing a mugging he's not allowed to prevent while being lectured by his boss for actually helping customers, he decides enough is enough. And it's at that moment that he's hired on a secret mission to stop a killer robot. What he doesn't know is that the person who hired him on that mission, Syndrome(Jersey Trilogy veteran Jason Lee), created that robot and is a villain who used to idolize him when he was a boy until he was rejected as his boy wonder. From that point on, Elasti-girl and other heroes are called up again to save their father/husband and stop Syndrome from a fiendish plot, which does NOT involve taking over the world. I won't spoil that plot for you, or the ending, but I will say I would've like it better if Syndrome had suffered a different fate at the end, one which has to do with the hazards of capes for superhero costumes, something which the costume designer of the superheroes, and part-time normal fashion designer, Edith Head look-alike Edna Mode(voiced by writer/director Brad Bird) tries to warn Bob about when he seeks his new costume. Oh, that and it'll go down in animation history for both it's humor and it place in the Disney/Pixar chain.",8,0,1,30 November 2004
Men in Black," Funny sci-fi: No spoofing necessary
","I'd put this in the top 5 of 1997. Men in Black is proof that  when you make a comedic science-fiction film, you don't have to do it by making fun of an existing one. I know, some people consider it a 'Ghostbusters of the 1990's,' but I don't believe that. The Ghostbusters never hid what they were all about, in fact they were publicity hounds, who exploited it for all it was worth. The MiB's did everything possible to hide themselves, their activities, and the supernatural creatures they sought to conceal, although hiding a flying saucer from thousands of baseball fans at Shea Stadium must be quite a task.From what I know about people who truly believe that aliens are among us, the MiB's are a threat. This movie takes this portion of UFO folklore and turns it upside down. I wonder if the creator of the comic book believes in UFO's.I wish you could give us the opportunity to give fractions of votes, because instead of voting '7,' I'd vote '7.5!'",7,1,1,18 April 1999
Pulp Fiction," No Divine Intervention Here
","Judging from some of the user comments here, I can't believe what I'm reading. Does anybody seriously expect us to believe, as Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) suggested, that 'God came down from heaven, and stopped the bullets,' when he and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) were shot at? It wasn't God's hand, but the shaky hand of a man who couldn't shoot straight, and ended up paying for it with his life.",Null,0,1,5 February 1999
Stranger Than Fiction," Not exactly a copy of The Truman Show, which is part of the reason it was so good.
","Despite the fact that I liked this much better than 'The Truman Show,' I'm not 100% sure that comparison is accurate. For one thing in The Truman Show there's a mass audience that knows who Jim Carrey's character is, and everybody knows that he's on television except for him. Nobody knows Will Ferrell's character, except for his co-workers, and one writer who doesn't even know he's a real person. There's another reason, but I forgot what it was.Will Ferrell plays Harold Crick, an IRS Agent who lives a lonely, ultra-mechanical life. He counts every step to the bus stop, every stroke of his toothbrush, etcetera. He's also a math whiz, so he's certainly capable of such anal-retentive behavior. Plus he has a fancy electronic wristwatch which is almost like a living creature. It tends to act like Rufus from 'Kim Possible' and similar characters that pre-date that Disney cartoon, most of which tend to be animal companions. The guy would be living a pretty hum-drum life if it weren't for the fact that he has a voice in his head following him around and narrating the details of his every actions. And who is this mysterious British woman that narrates his life? Karen Eiffel(Emma Thompson), a chain-smoking woman with a severe case of writer's block who has a habit of killing off main characters in every book she writes, and may be a bit suicidal herself. Needless to say, Harold Crick is in deep doo-doo.Maggie Gyllenhaal is Ana Pascal, a 1990's-style self-proclaimed anarchist who runs a coffee shop, and deliberately leaves behind a portion of her taxes so we can't defend the country against our enemies. This refusal to pay her taxes is what brings her to Crick's attention. Luckily, she makes these incredible cookies, and as you can expect from a movie like this, the two fall in love simply because they're opposites.A lot of people have complained about Queen Latifah as the publishing company secretary Penny Escher, but I think she was important. She was a straight-woman to Eiffel's melancholia, and was sent by the company to rush Eiffel into finishing her book. Little do they know how much of a fatal mistake they'd be making if she succeeds.While taking some time off on the request of his boss(Tom Hulce), and seeing a psychiatrist about his trouble, the shrink(played by Linda Hunt) recommends that Crick sees a literary professor named Jules Hilbert, as an alternative to psychotropic medication. Dustin Hoffman plays that literary professor, whom Crick seeks help in order to escape the wrath of Ms. Eifell. It's during one of those meetings that Crick finds out just who the woman controlling his destiny is, as the Professor leaves his TV running, showing an old interview on a show similar to C-Span's Book-TV. Puzzled as to why anybody would write about Crick, Hilbert suggests Crick staying at home and doing nothing. This fails miserably when construction workers tear his apartment down.The movie takes a much more drastic turn when Ms. Eiffel discover's there really is a Harold Crick, who discovers that she's not the all-powerful, sinister puppet-master he thought she was. It makes me wonder how I'd react if I found any of my unpublished characters coming to life before my very eyes. It also makes me wonder if any of the other characters she created were real people. Of course, something else altogether different makes Eiffel decide the fate of Mr. Crick, and I really would rather let you find out what that is for yourself.As other IMDb users have mentioned, this movie shows that Will Ferrell can get away with playing in other kinds of movies besides sophomoric comedies like 'Anchorman' and 'Talladega Nights,' both of which had the same pacing, and the latter of which I liked much better. On the DVD there are a pair of extended scenes of some of the Book-TV type interviews used in the background in Professor Hilbert's office. Darlene Sunshine(Kirsten Chentworth) was attractive, but utterly annoying and stupid. In spite of that I still say it's worth picking up.",Null,0,0,26 January 2008
Bring It On," No 'Brittany Taylor's' on this squad.
","Most movies and TV shows involving cheerleaders make them out to be idiots, notably TV movies about the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders, the one about the Los Angeles Laker girls starring Tina Yothers, and especially that fine upstanding MTV cartoon of the late-1990's 'Daria.' But while the ones in 'Bring it On' aren't all A students, they're certainly not the bimbos we're used to seeing. The only thing Torrance Shipman has in common with Brittany Taylor(besides C-average grades and a bratty little brother), is that she's a blonde.This movie elevates cheerleaders as something more than eye-candy with negative I.Q.'s for middle-aged horny men and sex-deprived teenage boys. It presents them as athletes in their own right, and when you consider that every other athletic team on the Rancho Carne High Toros are complete losers, they're lucky the cheerleaders are so good.... or are they? Torrance Shipman(Kirsten Dunst) has just replaced 'Big Red'(Lindsay Sloane) as team captain, and realizes she's under a lot of pressure, especially with her boyfriend leaving for college, and a member of the squad injured during practice. When two new kids move in from Los Angeles, Torrance finds out that she's falling for the new boy, and his sister(who proved to be a shoe-in at tryouts) is a gymnastics student who reveals that all their routines were stolen from an inner-city high school. After the rest of Rancho Carne High finds out their routine was stolen, they hire a snobbish pill-chugging choreographer named Sparky Polastri. Notice I said 'pill-chugging,' not 'pill-popping.' Unfortunately, this works just as well as Big Red's stolen routine, and now they have to use every other athletic, gymnastic, and and dance form to enhance their routines.This movie gives a whole new perspective on cheerleading, but even that's not what makes it so good. Aside from the chance to ogle the goodies of a group of young women, it shows them as individual people, who happen to be dedicated to their sport. It also makes a blatant effort to debunk the myth of male cheerleaders being gay, by having a blatantly horny member who's fingers 'occasionaly slip' under his fellow squad-member's dresses, and one cheerleader who seems to like it... a lot. Best of all, it has actual humor. Eliza Dushku has some great lines, but she's not the only one with some good ones. And for better or worse, it has raised the bar for REAL cheerleaders who now have to live up to this movie as the standard level of excellence.",Null,0,0,20 April 2005
The Producers," Great film through and through
","One of my favorite lines from 'The Producers,' was the one where Max Bialystock read the play about the man who turned into a giant cockaroack, and said 'It's too good.' How can you go wrong there? As for Roger DeBris's secretary/lover, I'd like to know if Mel Brooks named him after the Volkswagen Karman Ghia, and just changed the spelling, because until I saw this movie, whenever I heard the words 'Karman Ghia,' I thought of the car. Furthermore, Lorenzo St. DuBois's song 'Love Power,' was butchered on the soundtrack. I know it was played for laughs, but it's still a halfway decent song. I'm surprised that some band never did a remake of it.  This movie IS one of the funniest of all time, and had an incredible impact on me as well. On occasions where I've visited Lincoln Center in NYC, I've had to fight the temptation to prance around the water fountain  and shout 'I'LL DO IT!!,' at the top of my lungs. I wouldn't be surprised if other people have done things like that over there.",7,1,1,3 March 1999
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," As clich√© as this sounds, it's a guilty pleasure.
","From the days of the trailer for 'Old School,' Will Ferrell has tried to present himself within his post-Saturday Night Live career as both the new Steve Martin and John Belushi at the same time. The trouble is, he tends to fail at it. I stated in my review of 'Stranger Than Fiction' that I liked this movie better than 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,' yet for some reason, I can't think of why. I could give you some aspect of what makes the movie so good though.Ricky Bobby was born in the back seat of a souped-up 1969 Chevrolet Chevelle, racing it's way to the hospital. Throughout much of his childhood, Ricky lived with his single mother(Jane Lynch) and faced an uncontrollable urge to jump in a car and put the pedal to the metal, and sporadic visits by his father(Gary Cole), a 'semi-professional' race car driver, and part-time dope-dealer. Wow. He was as anxious to get his driver's license as I was when I was a little kid. As an adult, Ricky ends up joining the Dennit Racing Team's NASCAR pit crew. But when the driver wastes too much time in the pit, Ricky takes over, wins the race, and immediately becomes a star, despite the objections of the younger half of the father & son(Pat Hingle & Greg Germann) team owners. Even better, a female fan(Leslie Bibb) flashes him and he marries her, and they have two kids who are spoiled rotten. Oh, but somebody new is about to join the Dennit Racing Team; a French Formula One racing champion(Sacha Baron Cohen). Worse than that, a GAY French Formula One racing champion. Even worse than that, he's GOOD! Talladega Nights doesn't make fun of the French, so much as it makes fun of how certain Americans, especially rednecks from the old south view the French. And it's competition with this Frenchman that leads to his downfall. But that's not enough for Larry Dennit, who talks Bobby's wife into marrying his best friend. I often get the feeling Carley Bobby secretly works for Dennit Racing. After returning home to his mother with his two kids, and meeting his father again, Dad tries to get him back into racing. It seems like it might work, but even that falls apart.Molly Shannon is also great as Larry Dennit Jr.'s drunken, orgasmically-addicted wife. From time to time I've wondered if Ferrell had a thing for her, since they've been in so many projects together. But Amy Adams elevates this movie, just as Robin Williams has been known to elevate really bad comedies. As nerdy race-team secretary turned lover Susan, she makes two faux-inspirational speeches, the first of which sends both the main character and the movie right back on track. Her role in this movie is the least comedic, even less than pit crew head Lucius Washington(Michael Clarke Duncan), and yet you have to pinch yourself to remind yourself that this is a joke.As I pointed out, the movie doesn't really bash the French. In all honesty, it doesn't bash Southerners that hard either. If they really wanted to bash them, they could make them klansmen or idiotic hillbillies oblivious to the modern world. I never even saw a single confederate flag at any of the races, which would've made the movie a little more authentic. Nevertheless, though it's hardly the comedy epic that 'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,' 'National Lampoon's Animal House,' or 'The Blues Brothers,' were, it's still amusing and enjoyable enough.",6,0,0,30 March 2008
