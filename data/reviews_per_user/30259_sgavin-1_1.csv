United 93," Very well done
","You will see the confusion and the worst of September 11th, 2001, make no mistake about it. But you will also see the best which came from the passengers of United 93.This film was very well made. It is real-time, and as another reviewer mentions, there are no 'big names' in the cast. The portrayals are very convincing, and the viewer feels as though he or she is there, on board the aircraft, or in the FAA traffic control centers, or at Northeast Air Defense Center.It is one of the few films I have seen in a theater, after the showing of which, one could hear a pin drop. Highly recommended.",10,2,8,28 April 2006
