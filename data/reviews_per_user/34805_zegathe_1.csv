Your Name.," breathtaking
","My heart stopped at least 20 times watching this movie. It was so emotional, so interesting, so odd, so beautiful I don't even know if I can find enough words to express how good it really was. The story was absolutely fantastic and the soundtrack fits it perfectly. I'm not the kind that cries during movies but this one had me in tears for like 20 minutes. It's a must!",10,9,14,25 April 2017
