Iron Man 3," short and simple
","okay, I gotta admit that I'm a big comic and Marvel fan and I loved IM and kinda loathe IM2. IM3 was a really good conclusion to a story that told us who Tony Stark is and what IM means to him and why he is what he is.I see that many are concerned that the movie does not follow the comic book story lines, but that shouldn't weight in. a movie tries to stand alone. to be self contained and understandable, even for people not familiar with the franchise.I'd say the movie did a great job there. it's easy to follow, has a nice twist (but only if you followed the hype :P and that is not always good). and keeps you interested in the rather short journey.it's nowhere near perfect. it's a popcorn, eye candy movie. the acting is ranging from average to good (Kingsley and RDJ stand out here, Cheadle really has nothing to do, and Pierce once more shows that he his very versatile)don't go overboard. Marvel plays it safe by the audience and risky towards the nerd fan herd (me included). but I rather see a ballsy move a'la Mandarin then the repetition of story lines from comic books.take a beer (or maybe two or three and a pee break) and some friends and enjoy the show.and don't worry, he'll be back for Avengers. it's comic books, everything's possible ;)",7,0,2,14 May 2013
Clash of the Titans," the clash without titans
","I've just seen the movie this night in a special midnight preview for good money and, damn, I was excited. waiting months for a movie can do that to me. I even got an upgrade on my seat, middle row center seat.But the best seat in the cinema couldn't change the disaster on the screen. I wasn't expecting a high class movie with great storytelling or great acting. but this was ridiculous. I like big movies with great action and I enjoy a good anti hero but this was nothing at all The gods looked more misplaced in there medieval armor than frightening or superior. the performance of Neeson and Finnes was nothing I would ever expect from one of the two. no emotion, no style, no gods. Worthington was as disappointing as Perseus as Arnie would be as Hamlet. it was flat. I mean really flat. 2dimensional. all characters were just black and white figures with no intentions or depths. The dialogues were mere excuses to get them to the next place to kill some monsters and get killed. but I guess there are enough people out there that talk lots about bad actingwhat really disappointed me was the lame action. where I expected to see long shots without any cuts to enjoy the epic of a true battle I only found a MTV music video clone in theatrical length. To many cuts, the camera as steady as filmed while an earthquake. you couldn't settle for one moment because the next one was just rushing in to confuse you. How can it be that the trailer of this movie is more calm and ordered than the movie itself? I just wanted to see an all out epic action movie. what I got was a waste of timeand fanboys, don't get me wrong, I love movies like this. the epic, the pathos, the action. I just enjoy watching movies like this. But the clash was nothing more than that a clash. no titans",3,9,14,9 April 2010
