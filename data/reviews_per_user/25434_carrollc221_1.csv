The Avengers," A Superhero Film You Must Watch!
","I have watched several films that span across many different categories and time-frames (everything from the absolute greatest to the all-time worst rated films). In my honest opinion, I believe that the movie is far from perfection, but definitely in the 9 range.A superhero film like this calls for tons of action and excitement and this movie delivers on every level and then some. A wonderful cast made it seem believably true - a rock-hard culmination of protagonists and antagonists in cooperation to fight the good fight against an unruly evil. Even if you were attending just to see one superhero, you would still get a kick from the others in the bunch. They were all at the top of their game in this film and there was not a single head in the audience that was not sitting at the edge of their seat in amazement.Excellent cast, great dialogue, wonderful camera shots for the action scenes and trust me, there were plenty of action scenes to go around. Several fights going on at the same time, so if you were disappointed with one fight, you can eagerly await as the camera approached another fight scene and it was constant battle to the very end! If there is one superhero film you should watch, it's this one - and if you don't feel like watching it in the theatres now, at least be open-minded to pick a copy up when it releases on Blu-ray & DVD.",9,0,2,6 May 2012
