First Man," Boring
","First of all, I feel like I have seen emotionally-dettached Gosling characters way too much now.
Second of all, I assume it was Spielberg's involvement that gave this the 'epic' treatment. Why would we invest in something like that? We already know the ending (and I guess I'm refering mostly to the final part of the movie).
It seems like the movie takes too long to establish why Armstrong is the way he is and to try to make us understand him. I think it would have been far more interesting to see things from the wives points of view and all the things they had no control over or no saying at all.
It's not terrible but I had to watch it in two sessions because it was putting me to sleep.",Null,0,2,3 December 2018
Pacific Rim," This could have been done in the 80s
","Maybe after watching The Bourne trilogy I expected Guillermo del Toro would be able to deliver action with intelligence or depth (The kind of depth that you find in a blockbuster like 'The hunger Games' if you realize what it is the actual story is criticizing). I guess the fans made me think 'Maybe this is an unappreciated gem'. But hell no. This is as generic as an action movie can be. It could have been easily made in the 80s. The Russians can get you any weapon, there are quirky characters and attempts of 'comedic relief'. Things remain the same: we have one damaged, mourning hero that is going to succeed in his work while facing the backlash of the new, fresher guy that is paired with his father (That is only 14 year his senior). I guess Del Toro thought it could be progressive to have a black man in charge and a woman fighting but nothe girl fights but she is always rescued ever since she was a girl and then our hero has to ask the other guy to 'apologize' to herthey also later are going to do something 'to clear the path for the lady'. So, no. There are no new things in this movie. The camera movements are so done, the victory speeches are cheesy, falling down while being chased downGod! I'm amazed anybody would love this being as generic as it is.",Null,0,3,17 November 2013
Warrior," Well done, but being honest it's basically 'The fighter' with a twist
","I have to say I really enjoyed this film and I'm not into movies about fights. I don't get why people in the academy always love them but this one is really amazing. It doesn't have many dialogues but Tom Hardy's performance is outstanding. I wanted to cry during the final fight. But I have to be honest and say that I have a weird relationship with my older brother and that's why this one hit me hard. Feeling like your older brother bailed on you is not something you can easily forget and Hardy portrays that so well. But then again, it happened the same with 'The fighter' because at the bottom is the same dynamic the most important part of the movie; but the latter has more substance and the only reason why I don't say it is better than this one it is because it had Mark Wahlberg in it.And this one has a Conan O'brien look alike :)",Null,1,7,4 December 2011
The Graduate," Horrendous leading characters
","I just watched this movie, fully aware of what a huge hit it was.
What I did not know is how insufferable Benjamin would turn out to be.
If the movie were out today, he would have a Tumblr account and would be sharing dramatic quotes in the darkness of his room. Thank God Anne Bancroft is around to hurt his fragile male ego into finally have sex with her.After months of sleeping with her, he does not understand why she, HIS LOVER, would not want him dating HER DAUGHTER.
Is this guy mentally challenged???
Then he finally goes on a date with said daughter, Elaine. He humilliates her but it's all good. They manage to fix everything with a kiss.
Next day he confesses the affair. Obviously she tells him to f-ck off and die.Days later he decides he is going to marry her. He decides. She does not know.
Romance!
He stalks her at the university.
Romance!
He crashes her date.
Romance!But overall all is good. She has feelings for him...AFTER ONE DATE...and she's willing to overlook that either he raped his mom (as mom said) or that he had an affair with her for months.
It's LOVE!He does not give her a break or space to breathe at the university and is constantly pushing her to get tested to get married.
Romance!Then papa Robinson of course is upset after figuring all out and wants him out of the picture... as any sane person would.
Elaine, a university student with no agency, is willing to marry whoever her parents tell her too because reasons.
But he comes and takes her away...as every person knows by now.
The end.
Looking forward for the next christmas with the entire family.Imagine how an entire generation saw this movie so many times and thought this was romantic and representative. Really troubling.",Null,1,1,16 July 2019
Creed II," Boring and pointless
","I watched creed out of curiosity and i ended UP loving the music and the nuances of the characters. Completely unexpected.
Now this one.
I guess since Drago's still a clichÃ©, i could not be bothered with the fight. I wanted to know more about bianca leaving her Dreams behind because of the pregnancy.
The music was as dull as the script.
I still enjoy the small scenes of Rocky dealing with aging alone.",Null,1,4,27 January 2019
