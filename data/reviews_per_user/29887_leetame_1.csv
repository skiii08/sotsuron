The Expendables 2," expendables 2
","I found this movie to be a high energy production with a lot of twists and turns better than the first. and certainly full of drama and action to satisfy any action/adventure buff. The double cross. and of course that's where it gets real interesting The storyline was of course the good guys versus the bad guys. And this is my favorite part is the special effects and the multiple types of guns to do battle with. Women watching this film had their pick of hot guys to drool over. If your a follower of the action/adventure genre thru the years, you'll pick up on the inside jokes they make. All I can say is I can't wait for the 3rd sequel due out this summer.",7,0,1,5 February 2014
