Hereditary," Wonderful
","It's a slow slow burn... but when it gets moving, it's fantastic! Beautifully shot, acted, and delivered, with an amazing soundtrack! Without giving much away, think Rosemarys Baby meets the House of the Devil, with a touch of something new! I loved it!",10,6,17,9 June 2018
A Star Is Born," Beautiful
","This has to be one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. The chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Lady GaGa is magical.A film star truly is born in Lady GaGa. Expect to see her at Oscar time, and showing up in films regularly. She was breathtaking. Cooper is mesmerizing, and will also be nominated for his performance as well as directing.Bring tissues, because you'll happy cry, sad cry, and beautifully cry your eyes out, throughout. Just do
Yourself a favor, and see this film. It's wonderful.",10,5,17,4 October 2018
Captain Marvel," Unfortunately this is Some Hit and a lot of Miss
","My girlfriend and i just left seeing this, and It felt like a crappy Syfy original that was granted a large budget.... Easily my least favorite marvel film ever. We both agreed to a 4.5 ish out of 10 stars.Brie Larson was horrid (we both agreed. It's Just not her role) At times she sounded like she was reading off of cards. If someone else was cast, that would've made it a bit better.The villain is generic, the story (what little it has) is cookie cutter, and the editing and story plotting felt sloppy and awkward. It's really jumbled and phoned in over all. They also did a couple things I'm not at all a fan of... but those would be spoilers.There was some funny and entertaining moments, but few and far between.The highlights are the Cat + Nick Fury, and Stan Lee's tribute that made me cry! Take them out and the film is absolutely abysmal. Almost every scene worth watching involved them.Anytime it felt like it was gonna get better, something drug it down. It's just very mediocre. Underwhelmed to say the least.The Definition of a filler. Even Marvel has a Misstep I suppose.",4,6,8,10 March 2019
Deadpool 2," More of the Good Stuff!!!
","If you loved the first, you'll love this. Another 2 hours of happy laughter and adventure! Screw a long ass review, just go see it!!! Be prepared to smile!",10,5,10,18 May 2018
Ready Player One," Incredible!!!
","Ready Player One is a gorgeous, nostalgic, fun filled, thrill ride, and the Reason we Go to the movies! A Pop/Nerd culture Package wrapped in a beautifully creative bow, this film doesn't disappoint. It thrills and fascinates. Steven Spielberg spent a lifetime granting us memories and magic, and now he's given us a film that i believe he made for himself as much as he did for us. A director that loves the movies as much as we do, takes us on a visual tour of our memories while granting us with new ones. I laughed, i smiled, I cried... I felt the youthful magic that is inside the imagination of a child, with the knowledge of an adult. It was everything I hoped for and more.See this film in the cinema, and treat yourself to the 3D version! It's remarkable and actually utilized in a way that adds to the experience.The beautiful moments of childhood will come back and be highlighted, as you're absorbed into the adventure, while making new on screen friends to cherish for years to come. The best part is that I got to experience it beside friends that I love and cherish. What a wonderful time! A+ Mr. Spielberg, you've opened my heart again! <3 thank you!",10,0,3,30 March 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Absolute Perfection
","Once upon a time in Hollywood is an absolutely beautiful and immersive love letter to the summer of 69, old time Hollywood, and the magic of cinematic imagination.If Tarantino, DiCaprio And Pitt don't all get Oscars the world is unjust. As someone that is fascinated by olden day Hollywood and also a Giant Sharon Tate fan (Margot kills it, unfortunately she's not on screen a lot. When she is though, she is perfection), there is so much to be marveled at, and I won't spoil anything about it, but I'll say that I left absolutely pleased with the way that every aspect is handled.It was nearly 3 hours of living out a fantasy for a person like me, but I'm fairly certain that Tarantino also lived out something magical that he needed to get out of himself.Perhaps his most personal and diverse film, he created something entertaining and beautiful! I couldn't be happier with the outcome. This one is instantly placed into my top films list.A+",10,34,51,26 July 2019
Joker," Perfection
","Joker is a cinematic masterpiece, that has the style and dark grit of classic 70s/early 80s films, with the modern effects and direction.The story itself is very important, with a deeper meaning, and exploration of mental illness and how the world treats it, and those suffering internally with less fortune in life. All this is done while maintaining the understanding of the character and keeping tied in enough for comic fans, but away enough to compel and disturb even the most anti-comic skeptic.The talk of an Oscar nomination for the legendary Joaquin Phoenix is a truth. His performance is another level, and awards should shower him, but it would be shameful to leave Director, Todd Phillips out of consideration, as every moment of this film is pure cinematic magic.As a cinephile, I often believe that motion pictures are a large part of what keep me driven to want to be in this world, that often times feels like a struggle to be a part of. Films like Joker, make me happy to be here and have seen such a remarkable work of art.I couldn't rate it higher. A+ my jaw is still dropped. Bravo to everyone involved!",10,1,3,5 October 2019
