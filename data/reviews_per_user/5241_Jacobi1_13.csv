Alien 3," Has The Gothic & Action appearance but not enough!
","Alien 3 **1/2Like Aliens did with Alien, Alien 3 continues where Aliens left off. God only knows how long its been the four remaining survivors where floating around in space between Aliens and Alien 3. They land on a planet that seems like it's been at least 100 years since that time and of course, everybody dies except for Ripley, otherwise Alien 3 wouldn't work. What surprises me was that Alien puts the Gothic Horror back in this movie that was left out of Aliens and combines it with action. However the movie ends to quickly. When we actually get into the mood and the tradition of Alien 3, the ending credits roll. Now the Special Assembly Cut Edition does give you time to enjoy the film. The studio should have released that version of the film instead of the version that is floating around which take less than two hours. The movie does try to get it right but its only a few things.",5,2,4,27 October 2006
Alien: Resurrection," Gothic Horror to Action to Action Gothic Horror to Gore Film!
","Alien: Resurrection: *1/2Alien: Resurrection combines Action and Gothic Horror like Alien 3 did, but like what Aliens did, the makers of Alien 4 came up with a new genre for the Alien franchise, Gore Film. If you look closely at the film, the people die in very gruesome ways that it would make the Jigsaw Killer from Saw cringe. The characters are so stupid in this film that you have the feeling like your just watching a documentary on how stupid people can be. There is one scene where the captain of the crew ship that boarded the main ship heres a noise in the distance in a separate hallway. Instead of running, he investigate and I'm pretty sure I don't have to tell you what happens next. Now I like how director Jean-Pierre Jeunet puts a twist to this film but the screenwriter should have studied the first two Alien films (at least the first one) and see how they killed people instead of putting close up shots in and depict the grossest way a person can die. In other words Jeunet should have written the script himself.",3,0,1,27 October 2006
Alien," The Best Gothic Horror Film Of All Time!
","Alien ****In Space Where No One Can Hear You Scream. What a great tag line! Alien scares as well as to keep you guessing where the Alien is going to show up next and when it does, without hesitation, you jump out of your seat. What Ridley Scott has done here is take completely quiet moments, (Some horror films take moderate quiet moments), and then make the unexpected happen. The story is also great. In todays horror films, you don't get great stories. Another thing that this movie does is it takes it's time on where it wants to go and doesn't rush it. Today's audiences are so impatient with horror films that takes it's time that the director doesn't have enough time to deliver the goods. Alien also has that Gothic feel to it, and man doesn't have a Gothic feel to it. Suspiria has the same kind of feel but in Alien, the feel is more authentic mainly because it's in space, (However the Gothics in Suspiria is also authentic because of it's subject matter and the weird production designs). Alien has definitely stood the test of time.",10,3,6,27 October 2006
Apocalypse Now," A Great Dark War Film Into The Heart!
","Apocalypse Now ****The Deer Hunter may have been the first Vietnam War film to be released but Apocalypse Now was the first Vietnam War film to be in production and it might be the best war film I have ever seen, well, at least the best Vietnam War film. Director Francis Ford Coppola, (The Godfather part I & II, The Conversation), really takes us to the dark side of the human heart in this film. With beautiful cinematography, a haunting music score, and a great story, Apocalypse Now takes you on a ride of complete surrealism. Some people didn't like the film because they say it's too weird and over the top, perhaps but film never loses focus nor does the film bore my. A Great Film and one the best of the 1970's.Apocalypse Now Redux ***1/2Apocalypse Now Redux adds 49 minutes to the original version making it over three hours long. There is almost a lost scene added but it doesn't make sense. Their are more scenes with Marlon Brando which are great but the rest of the film seems to be on hold with the extra footage. One of my all time favorite deleted scene is when the group adrift onto a French Plantation and a famous ten minute scene when they are having dinner. Still, I think these scenes should be deleted scenes. However, it is still a good movie to watch.",10,0,1,20 October 2006
Aliens," A Nice Action Film for Action Fans!
","Aliens ***1/2Aliens is the successful sequel to the classic 1979 Gothic horror film Alien. The plot in this movie I have to say is one of the best plots in movie sequel history. The planet where the first Alien came from is colonized and instead of being one Alien, there are more, thus the title Aliens. Now the real question is, is Aliens better than Alien? Some people agree it is but the majority say the Alien was better and I have to agree. Alien was a great Gothic horror while Aliens is an action film. But is Aliens also a Gothic horror film? Yes, in a way but the action quickly takes over. People have said however the reason why Aliens is way better than Alien is because there is more then one alien so the character have nowhere to run. That maybe true but the fact that Aliens has so many aliens makes the option of guessing where they are going to strike from widely open and that is not an element of a horror film. The fact that Alien only had the one Alien made the opinion a lot narrow and it kept you guessing the whole entire time where the alien was going to be at which is a classic element of a monster movie and a horror movie. Aliens is a great action film but I just can't give four stars.",10,1,2,27 October 2006
The Exorcist," A Great Horror Film.
","The Exorcist ****I let my older sister and her friend watch The Exorcist and they were really freaked out. So did my two younger sisters but they were watching an edited version of the film. I overhead a student talking about The Exorcist and how he was completely shocked. Now this was in 2004. If a horror film can still scare people even though made over thirty years ago, then I think it deserves to be named one of the greatest horror movies of all time. The Exorcist was also an Academy Award disappointment. Why? Maybe they viewed the film as a Vomit Fest. Now I can't deny that people have gotten sick while watching the film, but after the second time, these people also saw how great of a horror film it really is.The Exorcist- The Version You've Never Seen ***1/2The Version You've Never Seen is just as slick and terrifying as the original. This version adds ten minutes to the original film. An extended seen at the doctors office and the exorcism, (not the exorcism in general), and the famous spider walk seen. The flaw with this version is the ending. The original ending was such a downer that it worked. This version has a friendship striking up at the end. However it is still a great film.",10,0,1,19 October 2006
Saw II," A promising sequel for a movie that was doomed from the start.
","Saw II **Saw II is the sequel to the successful Saw back in 2004. I didn't expect much out of this film but I was surprised that the film relied more on mood and settings than gore. However, the movie is a circle that keeps going and going. This movie gets in too deep in this circle that we end of at the first Saw movie. But you don't necessarily have to watch the first part to get the second part, unless your really confused. Another thing that I liked about this film was that we actually get several conversation pieces with John, the Jigsaw Killer. However the odds of the film out weighs the evens a lot more in Saw II. The ending is the exact same ending of the first Saw movie and coincidentally it takes place in the same room. Another odd is that we really could care less if these people live or die because they all are nasty to each other where it gets to the point where you want them to get trapped.",4,1,2,22 October 2006
Grindhouse," Death Proof is fun and original but Planet Terror crosses familiar territory!
","Grindhouse ***Planet Terror **1/2 Death Proof ***Grindhouse is the double feature from Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarintino. It's a homage to all the Grindhouse movies from the 60's and 70's. I have to say that the movie looks really good with its scratched and dirt infested reels. It really feels like you are watching an actual Grindhouse movie. However though, the problem with most Grindhouse movies is that the story lines are always weak. Grindhouse is no different. Planet Terror is about zombies. So is Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead & a couple more hundred films. It's not like Rodriguez wasn't creative, it's just that there is not a lot you can do with zombie movies. Death Proof is an a homage to exploitation films like Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill! It's about a stuntman who kills women in his car. However Tarintino carries a little too long with his duologue here, but the chase scenes make up for that. I give Death Proof 3 stars. Planet Terror only gets 2.5 stars from me because its a typically zombie movie however, Rose McGowan with a machine gun as a leg does make for some interesting viewing. All together Grindhouse is a good effect. Just not a great one!",6,0,1,18 December 2007
Saw," Kind of Stupid!
","Saw (Zero Stars)Get your barf bags out and get ready to hurl, because Saw makes you vomit until the last scene of this movie. How gross is this movie? Pretty gross! How relevant is this movie? It isn't! Should I watch this movie? Only if you are a sadistic person who likes to see people getting tortured for no apparent reason and not just because they don't appreciate their live. It's a stupid premise that only gets dumber as it goes.Two men are chained up with a dead person in between them. Yes, if you are thinking what I am thinking, you are correct. The two unfortunate morons who are chained up are Dr. Lawrence Gordon play be Cary Elwes and Adam who is played be Leigh Whannell, who also helmed the screenplay. Gordon is apparently there because he cheated on his wife and Adam is a sleaze photographer, saying that, you can pretty much figure out why he is there. Danny Glover makes a surprise appearance as Detective David Tapp who is obsessed with the Jigsaw Killer. Why? Your guess is just as good as mine. To make things more complicated, Gordon's wife and daughter get involved. Why? Whannell got bored! Saw is nothing but a snuff film disguised as a horror film that got away with an R rating! If you can tell the difference between a snuff film and a horror film, then there is no doubt in my mind that you'll view this movie as a snuff film too.",4,6,11,19 October 2006
Platoon," This movie was entertaining and yet very human!
","Platoon ****People who have seen Platoon say that they didn't like it. Why? I can't tell you but I have to say it's one of the greatest war movies of all time. People might put Full Metal Jacket (Another great war movie), as one of the best war movies before Platoon, but Platoon shouldn't be compared to Full Metal Jacket. Just because both movies took place in Vietnam doesn't mean they are the same movie. Platoon is about lies and deceit among a platoon. Instead of fighting the enemy, they fight each other, and they get blind sited. Yes the movie may seem more of a character study then a war movie but so what, The Deer Hunter was more of a character study and like Platoon, they were given the Academy Award for best picture. Platoon is about the soldiers and what they would do in war, not about killing someone.",10,1,2,25 October 2006
The Deer Hunter," A Great American Classic
","The Deer Hunter ****The Deer Hunter was the first movie about the Vietnam War to be released. At least thats what I know. But The Deer Hunter is not about the war in general. It's about the lives of three men who serve in Vietnam. The movie is about, before they go to war, while they are at war, and after they went to war. The movie is excellent in so many ways that I can't describe how the character feel about each other after the final scene. All I can say is that it seems that they don't know each other anymore. Can Vietnam distance people. Yes, especially when one of the three men decides to stay in Vietnam and becomes a Russian Roulette player and another loses his legs. The main character tries to ignore the fact that he has changed but he can't deny it. The war effected him and everybody around him. This is an excellent films about change and excepting change.",10,0,1,19 October 2006
300," Visually Stunning but the Story is Weak!
","300 **The movie starts off with a young Leonidus as a child preparing for manhood. The scene where the young boy fights a wolf is very magnificent. The next scene, we see an adult Leonidus preparing his son for manhood as the Persions try to overtake their land as well as many others. This sets the scene for 300.300 was directed by Zack Snyder who made the terrifying remake of Dawn of the Dead and the the movie is based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller who also wrote the brilliant Sin City. Sin City had great special effects and a great story. 300 also has great special effects but the story is incredible weak. I sadly have to say it's one of the many, many, many cases where the visual effects start taking over the story.It's not just the incredible visual effects that flaw the movie. The B story is boring and clichéd. Queen Gorgo tries to convince the counsel to send more soldiers for the aid of her husband, King Leonidus. However Theron has is own agenda. Personally, I don't understand what this has anything to do with the story, it just slows the movie down. My only guess is that Lena Headey and Dominic West needed more screen time. Plus, if you've seen any movie that takes place during the Roman and/or Greek times, then it doesn't take a genius to figure out that Theron has betrayed his own people. Last but not least, I think that Gerald Butler really overacted his part as King Leonidus.Even thought 300 looks more like a video game, it's still more realistic than Troy and Alexander and there are some things to enjoy here. For instance, this movie has the most gorgeous decapitation scene, but there are more decapitation scenes to follow so it doesn't really make it that fascinating. 300 is visually stunning but the story falls flat on it's face.",4,0,0,18 December 2007
Fantastic Four," A Very Uninteresting Movie!
","Fantastic Four *2005 was a year with only a few great movies based on graphic novels or comic books. To me the best were Batman Begins and the Director's Cut of Sin City. Both incredible films. Fantastic Four isn't however. It is actually one of the worst films of 2005. The cartoon series was so good because the characters were really into their powers but here the character seem that they know what powers they are going to get and it's nothing new to them. To be honest, I was rooting for Dr. Doom to kill all four of them to avoid a sequel which we all know is coming. The movie avoids clique comic book films but by doing that, the movie also avoids the intelligence and the competence of the characters. The movie really plays us for dumb. The movie assumes that we are not familiar to these characters and therefore makes no afford to properly introduce us to them. Spend more time on the characters like Spider-Man 2 does and less on plot and special effects on the sequel.",2,1,3,24 November 2006
