Black Swan," An Experience
","Wow! I'm still trying to gather all my thoughts about this film, so all I can say for sure is that it was an absolute rush! The acting from Natalie Portman was tremendous - the Oscar she received for her role was definitely wholeheartedly deserved. I loved the slowly increasing sense of madness this film conveyed. I felt like I was losing my mind as I was watching it. The cinematography and editing helped add to this feeling significantly because of how the camera is always moving and weaving in and out and around the characters - making you feel like you are part of the action and dancing.I also loved the use of music. Very few moments in the film are devoid of it. The last fifteen or so minutes are a particularly good example since the music is ever-present and it builds and builds along with the final performance until the very last moment and then...applause. It's hard to summarize and convey the effect that it has in a few words. Perhaps the best way to put it would be that it makes you feel the pressure, madness, rush, and finally ecstasy that Portman's character is feeling during the final act.The 108 minute runtime flew by so quickly for me that when the film ended I was taken completely off-guard. That's not to say the ending felt abrupt though; I think it ended at the absolute perfect moment. I was simply completely and utterly captivated by what I was seeing that I lost track of time and everything around me.I really should not have put off watching this film for so long, especially with all the recommendations I got for it. This was incredible!",9,2,3,16 June 2019
The Birth of a Nation," A Horrific and Important Piece of History
","This film was like watching someone discover fire for the first time in history but then immediately use it to burn down a village.
So how the hell do I rate this? Do I look purely at the film's extremely impressive technical achievements and innovations? Or do I only look at the horrific racism that the film presents?
Instead I'll rate The Birth of a Nation based on its historical significance, which is undeniable. Whether it was the film's huge influence on the film industry or severe consequences for American society, it certainly made its mark on history. That it is still so controversial and argued about to this day is proof.
Remember, history is not all good. It is filled with hatred, violence, and endless wars. However, that is a large part of why it is essential to have knowledge of history: so that when new history is made, it might not be as bleak as the time period in which The Birth of a Nation was produced. For that reason, this is an important film, and one that should be seen by anyone with an interest in cinema. It, at the very least, can serve as a warning for the hatred that can be propagated when art is used maliciously or irresponsibly.",10,10,17,16 August 2019
12 Angry Men," A Masterpiece
","12 Angry Men is a masterpiece. I don't think it would be an exaggeration to say it's as close a film can get to being flawless.The premise is simple: twelve men on a jury have to decide whether a young man is guilty of committing a murder or not. The film is all-dialogue and virtually the entire runtime takes place in a single room.
What makes the film truly special is how its individual aspects fit together so well.The writing is immediately gripping and does not waste a single moment of screentime - every piece of dialogue in the film has a purpose to serve in the tightly-woven story. Things that are alluded to or spoken about previously are brought up again in later dialogue. Not only does this help build the characters, but it also plays an important role in the story when a character contradicts their own argument or proves another's point unintentionally, for example.Adding to this, all of the characters are unique and distinct from one another. You quickly get a sense of each character's personality and who they are through their dialogue, appearance, body language, and how they speak. This is made all the more vital due to the fact that the audience is not even told the names of the jurors - we end up knowing them purely by their personalities. Needless to say, the acting required to pull this off is incredibly impressive.Also, I love the camerawork in this. Many parts of the film are comprised of long takes where the camera is panning around the room or from character to character. Other times, the camera will cut to a close-up of a character's face or slowly zoom in. It works incredibly well in the telling of the story and accentuates the brilliant acting.I honestly do not have a single complaint about this film. It is immensely impressive in every way and I find it thoroughly interesting every time I watch it. As far as I'm concerned, it is an essential viewing and I can not recommend it highly enough.",10,1,2,13 June 2019
Cars 2," Pixar's Weakest Film
","The talented people at Pixar have brought us many excellent films over the years such as Toy Story, Monsters Inc, Ratatouille, Inside Out, and most recently Coco, to name a few. Unfortunately, as I watched Cars 2, I became increasingly dismayed as I realized it was the first film from Pixar that I truly disliked. Granted, I did not care much for the original Cars in 2006, but it is not a straight-up bad film. Cars 2, on the other hand, is a massive step down from its predecessor.The major difference between the first and second film is that whereas the first focuses on Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson), going through a decent amount of character growth before a large racing competition, the second oddly focuses on the first film's comic relief character, Tow Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), who is caught up in a plot involving secret agents and a monocle-wearing super villain. Meanwhile, McQueen and his new racing problem is relegated to something of a backdrop.The biggest issue in this film is the focus on Tow Mater, who is annoying at the best of times and insufferable at the worst. Unfortunately for me, he is in the majority of this nearly two-hour long film. Meanwhile, the story itself is dull and generic. The plot is identical to those in countless spy/action films and there is absolutely nothing new to see here. The story ends up feeling deflated and tedious as a result, which is a real shame when past Pixar films have had a great deal of creativity in their writing.However, despite these criticisms, I understand that this is a film targeted for a much younger audience than myself. I am sure children who see this film will have a great deal of fun with it, but I am disappointed since Pixar films usually have some appeal for people of all ages. In Cars 2 there is sadly very little for older audiences unless you like Larry the Cable Guy.I will give credit where it is due, however. Cars 2, in terms of visuals, animation, and voice-acting has a level of polish that is to be expected from a Pixar release with a production budget of $200 million. For that, I have to give the film at least some points.Overall, Cars 2 would be an okay but completely unremarkable film if Larry the Cable Guy did not have such a large presence in it. As it stands though, listening to Tow Mater chattering throughout the 106 minute runtime brings my opinion of it from roughly neutral to moderately negative. It is a film I would recommend avoiding unless you loved the original Cars or want to see it for completionist's sake.",3,0,2,15 January 2018
Amélie," Pure Happiness
","It has been many years since a film has made me happier and warmed my heart more than Amélie has. It's like wrapping yourself up in a warm blanket in front of a fire on a chilly winter day.Sometimes it takes me twenty or thirty minutes to form a general idea of what I think of a film, but I knew I would love this one almost immediately.The acting is great, the camerawork is creative, the myriad of characters are super interesting in their own distinct ways, the writing is very playful, the score is lovely (especially that piano), and Audrey Tautou is simply a joy to watch.It frustrates me when I recommend a film to a friend and they seem very interested until I mention it is in a language other than English. Since Amélie is French, I expect people who are averse to subtitles will avoid seeing it and that's very sad indeed because this is a film that just about everyone can find some happiness in.",10,0,1,19 July 2019
