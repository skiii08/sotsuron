The Monuments Men," Made for cigarette companies?
","I felt a bit funny as I was the only one in the theater when the show started, but soon I would know why. Absolutely disappointing. Worst script and editing I've ever seen on screen!! What Cloony trying to communicate becomes an absolute misery to the audience!! The flow is totally broken, hopeless editing, poor connection to consecutive scenes, and one would wonder why there are so many actors wandering, roaming around doing nothing - is this all about the era of unemployed? There is no serious appearance from any actor other than Cate! Also, it is so annoying to see how tobacco companies are so powerful in this movie. Actors seems to enjoy cigarettes more than acting, and I am at a total loss why you have to show so much of intense, close-up cigarette smoking scenes which are horrible for non-smokers!! Clooney has totally lost his plot and momentum and so have my faith in him. Stick to your acting Mr Clooney and don't you never ever try directing again - never!!",1,16,25,11 April 2014
The Godfather," Grossly and undeservingly overrated!
","I watched the DVD recently because everyone seems to be hyped about this 'greatest movie on earth'!! Well, I wouldn't waste your valuable time any further writing a lot here after wasting my good 3 hours watching so called God Father. I nearly died of boredom. Simply, this is one of the most boring, longest movies I have ever watched. And it is horrible! Is it a great story? No. Is it a great movie? NOT AT ALL!! It is just a welded work of so many boring, long celluloid pieces together. There is no stature, depth, matter or even an exciting plot. After all, Brando is a good actor but not that great in this one for sure. And I am still at a loss to understand why people give this rut 9.2!! It would of course be totally right just without the 9!",1,27,79,8 December 2014
