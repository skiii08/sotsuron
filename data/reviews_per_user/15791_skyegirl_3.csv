The Blair Witch Project," was anyone else bored?
","Maybe I just waited too long to see it, but I found the Blair Witch project to be a waste of time and money.  I came to the theater expecting to see a scary movie.  What I saw were three stupid, immature people, freaking out about 'scary noises'.  At no point in the movie was I scared.  If you asked me to go spend a week in the woods, I would say yes in a second.  Even the ending, which is supposedly the really scary part, was lame.  I couldn't believe the hype this movie received.I know part of the appeal of this film was how different it is from the typical Hollywood horror flick.  Well, I didn't find it to be all that different, just slightly more boring.  If you want to feel intensity, tension, or basically emotion of any kind, PLEASE go and see the Sixth Sense and leave the witch hunting to the less intelligent.I just fail to see who thought this movie was scary - or good on any level. I found it to be an absolute disappointment.",1,1,3,25 August 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," much better than the usual teen romance
","I recently saw 10 Things I Hate About You and was pleasantly surprised. After the flood of boring, formula teen-targeted movies, I was expecting another two hours of wooden actors and a script my six year old brother could have improved on.  However, I found the movie to be engaging and quite funny.  The characters were very well acted; the plot, while predictable, still had a few unexpected points.  The chemistry between Julia Stiles (Kat) and Heath Ledger (Patrick) was great, and they really kept the film going. I'll definitely be buying this on video.",10,0,0,19 August 1999
The Princess Bride," one of the greatest
","I'm a senior in a small high school, and the Princess Bride is OUR class movie.  I don't know anyone who doesn't like this film, and if you see it, you'll understand why.  Just check out all the comments here, there's not a bad review!  How many movies can you say that about?  And how many movies have such great quotes?  This movie is just amazing.  I love the characters, the story, the fight scenes, the comedy, Wesley... If you haven't seen it, GO and rent it NOW.",Null,1,3,26 September 1999
