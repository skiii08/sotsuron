Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A great prequel to the Star Wars Epilogue
","This long-awaited prequel to the Star Wars Epilogue was very good. The only problem is too much time was spent on special effects and not enough on character development.  It would have been interesting to have seen this movie done in the late 70's or early 80's.  None the less, if you are a Star Wars fan, this movie helps complete the story of the Skywalker family and is a must see.",9,14,20,29 May 2000
The Iron Giant," Great Animated Story not from Disney
",The Iron Giant is a great animated story suitable for kids of all ages.  It has a strong moral message yet is fun and entertaining.  I think it captured the paranoia of the early cold war (late 50's) quite well that only the adults would appreciate.  I give the movie 10 out of 10 stars.,Null,0,1,25 November 1999
