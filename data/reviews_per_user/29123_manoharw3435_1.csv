Despicable Me 2," Despicable Me 2
","A good movie to rest and relax with for the whole family. No nudity and vulgarity, just the butt of Kevin the minion on the beach. It was subtle and funny, the music was excellent specially the rendition of 'I Swear' (All 4 one). A must see and get a copy for your library too :-) Knowing Steve Steve Carell, Kristen Wiig,and Russell Brand and their caliber of comedy it was hilarious with their blend, it was perfect and very real entertainment. I can see this project gathering momentum as we believe in more minions and the unblemished humor dished out by these devils and stop watching other ego headed humans who try to pretend that the world revolves around them.",9,0,0,20 January 2014
