The Avengers," 'Are you sure about this?' 'Yeah, it'll be fun.'
","The elders say that two is company, anything more is just a crowd. Avengers shows a big fat middle finger to those learned folks of yore, and in the process easily sets the new benchmark for all epic action extravaganzas! With an ensemble star cast, a fast, witty script, thrilling action sequences, and masterful direction, it is the perfect superhero movie, one which will charm not only the nerdy fans, but also the uninitiated.The Avengers project began over 10 years back, when Marvel first thought of bringing their superhero team on screen, but to give each hero a rightful back story they had to bring out the individual movies first. Each of them were characterized by action, humour and a certain degree of insaneness. The movies generated big bucks at the box office, but i always felt Marvel was holding back something- whether the grandness of plot, or the scale of action. This is what it was saving for, no holding back for the $220 million mother of all actioners, Avengers- 6 superheroes, one mental Norse God, a full scale alien invasion- this one has got it all.The story picks up plot strands from the previous movies- Loki steals the Tesserect, a cube like artifact which is a source of great power, which he plans to use to open a portal through which his alien friends in skullcaps invade Earth. Post credit scenes in the older Marvel movies show that Nick Fury has been preparing for just one such rainy day- where the Earth will be 'hilariously out gunned' and there will be the need for the individual superheroes to come together to fight as a team. To form an unbeatable squad, each superhero gets something to the table- Hulk brings the muscle, Captain America brings strategy, Ironman brings style and technology, Thor brings emotion along with Godlike fury, Hawkeye brings steely sincerity and Black Widow brings smoking-hot sexiness. But before they can take on Loki and his minions, they will have to get over their superhero sized egos and other intra heroic tensions so as to work together in a team. Much of the film's uproarious moments come due to the witty banter of the superheroes. The climactic showdown between the good guys and evil aliens might seem overdrawn and similar to the one in last year's Transformers- dark of the Moon, but is infinitely more enjoyable, each scene a joyous ode to the capabilities of this awesome fighting team, each sequence bettering the previous one. The movie's biggest strength is its star cast- Robert Downey as Ironman, continues from where he left off in Ironman 2- 'billionaire, playboy, genius, philanthropist'- he calls himself, as he lends sarcastic humour to an 'oh so serious' group. Chris Evans as Captain America might wear a ridiculous stars and stripes costume but does what is required with utmost sincerity. Chris Hemsworth as Thor does a decent job in showing angst and turmoil, while Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson as Hawkeye and Black Widow are serviceable as second rate heroes to the A-team. However the scene stealers were Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk and Hiddleston's Loki. Ruffalo is probably the best Hulk to grace the silver screen, and while Edward Norton and Eric Bana played the role with intensity, Ruffalo plays him with a lot of self deprecating humour. Trust me, with or without pants, the Hulk will keep you in splits, but reserve your wolf whistles for the scene where the Hulk delivers the coup de grace to Loki. Loki's expression immediately after- priceless :) Speaking of whom, the star of the movie IS Loki- a superhero movie is as good or as bad as its villain (think Joker in the dark Knight or Doc Ock in Spiderman 2)- and in Avengers, Hiddleston plays Loki in a manner that man to man, he stands head and shoulders above the heroes. This Loki, like most super villains has a sinister, single point agenda- to rule the world, and in its quest he even manages to make a crowd of people kneel down to him, in of all places, Germany- not-so-long-ago home to one of the biggest megalomaniac in the history of the world. When Loki is captured and held in a glass cell, he gives a little bit of the Hannibal Lecter treatment to Scarlett.You do a far better job if you love what you do, and director Joss Whedon is a certified geek, having written comics in addition to having directed two cult series. The biggest input that Joss Whedon brings, is to create an environment of impending doom without letting the audience get overworked with it- 'hold on', he seems to say, 'the solution is just round the corner'- it helps the movie not to take itself too seriously, unlike the DC Comic adaptations. Avengers is a celebrity jamboree of sorts, and yet Whedon manages to give each star his place, each character, his due Avengers weighs in at 146 minutes, but to his credit, Whedon keeps the pace snappy throughout, whenever things begin to sag, jokes, punchlines, and slam bam action sequences pop up to keep the party going strong. To sum up, Avengers is a superlative effort. Mixing fantasy, science fiction, imagination, colourfully dressed he-men, this is the film Marvel fans have been waiting for ages- they took their time, but they delivered on all counts. This is a no holds barred, effects driven, mass appeal blockbuster par excellence, absurdly entertaining- these 146 minutes felt like an entire summer vacation in Asgard for geeks such as me, and will sure extend its magic to the non fans. There are so many characters, yet it never felt too many, production values are solid, the script engaging, with loads and loads of nonstop action. Geeking out has never been so much fun.",9,0,1,7 May 2016
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," best build up for mockingjay part 2
","Mockingjay begins where the Catching Fire movie ended. Katniss is in a bad way, she's very upset and nurses are trying to get her to come out from where she's hiding. From the dialogue you can tell it's something that has occurred a lot. Katniss is given a sedative much to her pleas not to and the Mockingjay logo appears on screen.We then start off once again with Katniss waking up on her hospital bed in District 13 and is greeted by her little sister Prim.In Mockingjay Katniss finds herself in district 13, a secret district most people in Panem believe no longer exists. Which is understandable as everyone is hidden underground in a secret bunker. Katniss makes a deal with president coin thanks to the help of Plutarch that ensures the safety of the tributes held in the capitol and a mission to rescue them, in return Katniss is 'the Mockingjay' a symbol of rebellion throughout the districts.Jennifer Lawrence embodies katniss flawlessly once again on screen and gives a stunning performance as the female hero of the movie shooting down two capitol jets with her enhanced bows created by Beetee. Jennifer wowed the audience when she sung during the film, the song is also featured as the first credits song but sung by Lorde. Who knew Jennifer could sing?Once again Elizabeth Banks' portrayal of Effie Trinket gives the film the light and laughs it needs, Mockingjay is dark, the darkest of the three books, which is quite hard to fathom when you know that ultimately the books/movies are centered around teenagers fighting, wars, death and poverty. Haymitch is sadly absent throughout most of the movie, but the few scenes he is in he steals with his jokes on being sober and about his relationship with his best friend Katniss.Josh's performance as Peeta steals the movie for me, Peeta is now in the possession of the capitol and he's secretly being conditioned to say and do what Snow wants him to. Watching Josh as Peeta is absolutely heart- breaking as you see him slowly come to realise what has happened to his home, his family and to Katniss. Peeta's final scene in this movie is gut wrenching and sure to bring the audience to tears.Fans of the books will be pleased to know that the team behind the making of the movie have done an amazing job at converting the story from sheet to screen in a way that enhances the story more than expected and that warrants the need for a part two, is it November 2015 yet?.A moment of respect is featured at the beginning of the credits that pay tribute to the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman who passed away last year whilst filming Mockingjay P2.",9,22,61,23 November 2014
The Incredible Hulk," Marvel's most underrated movie
","with whom I am most familiar, albeit through the 1970s live-action series and the 1990s animated one. The film is great fun from start to finish. It may not have the same level of characterisation as its predecessor 'Iron Man' but I thought that the action scenes were more entertaining and the pacing was considerably better. The script is well written by Zak Penn and the star Edward Norton (uncredited in this capacity) and Louis Leterrier directs the film with style. It's a shame that the Hulk has gone on to become the Marvel Cinematic Universe's answer to the Wolf Man in that he got one film (the 2003 version notwithstanding) and then only showed up in crossover films rather than getting a sequel to himself. The film had great potential for a proper sequel but I don't really see it happening at this stage.Norton is extremely good as Bruce Banner who, in this version of events, was exposed to gamma radiation deliberately in a failed attempt by the US military to revive its World War II super-soldier project, something which would later be explored on screen in much more detail in 'Captain America: The First Avenger'. I generally prefer superheroes with powers as opposed to non-powered ones and the thing that I always liked about the Hulk's storyline is that there is a great sense of inner conflict. The Hulk represents the primitive, bestial side of human nature and is, in that sense, a throwback to our distant ancestors while Banner represents the better angels of our nature. We all have to struggle with the more primitive parts of us at times, though not quite so literally. However, the line is blurred somewhat in the film as the Hulk is not as animalistic as in other versions. The script does not allow Norton the same opportunity as Robert Downey, Jr. to play a character who grows and develops over the course of the film. However, he gives a great, understated performance and I always felt that the Hulk was just beneath the surface, waiting to manifest himself. I'm rather disappointed that this was Norton's only outing in the role.Betty Ross, played well by Liv Tyler, is not quite as strong a character as I would have liked but she is much better than Pepper Potts in 'Iron Man'. Betty is extremely intelligent, kind, brave, resourceful and loyal. It is obvious from the beginning why Bruce is attracted to her. Speaking of which, their romantic moments seemed a great deal more realistic and heartfelt than those between Tony and Pepper in 'Iron Man' and I am including the very sweet scene in which she calms down the Hulk in that. Bruce and Betty seem much more evenly managed and suited to each other, frankly. Tim Roth is as creepy and effective as you would expect as the Russian-born British Royal Marines officer Emil Blonsky but I would have preferred a better actor than the decent but not great William Hurt as General Ross. Tim Blake Nelson is great as Samuel Sterns and Ty Burrell has a nice cameo role as Betty's new boyfriend Leonard Samson. In a refreshing move, the film avoids the obvious cliché of making the other man in the love triangle a complete ass. Leonard is a nice, decent guy.The CGI in the film is very good if not quite state of the art by 2008 standards. It is at its most impressive during the hugely entertaining climactic battle between the Hulk and the mutated Blonsky. The Hulk looked better in the nighttime scenes than in the daytime ones. It was a good idea from a dramatic point of view that the Hulk's manifestations were relatively few and far between. I appreciated the somewhat light-hearted atmosphere of the film and the references to the 1970s TV series, most notably Lou Ferrigno's cameo as a security guard - he also provided the voice of the Hulk - and the clip of Bill Bixby, a lovely tribute to the late actor who is more associated with the role of David Banner (what's in a name?) than anyone else.Overall, this is a very enjoyable films which film rollicks along at a great pace and does not take itself too seriously.",8,0,1,7 May 2016
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," But I love Star Wars???
","Watching the older movies, I found it incredible that 'Phantom Menace' could be so bland, a result of featureless characters, an uninvolving story and excessive use of CGI special effects that never mesh with the story, but threaten to override it. So overdone are the effects, that watching this movie reminded me less of the first trilogy than of 'Cool World', Bakshi's misfire mix of live-action and animation. In this entry, a young Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan Mcgregor), only a student Jedi, travels with his teacher to the planet Naboo on a mission of mercy. Jedi Qui-Gonn Jin is older and wiser than Kenobi, but both are dispatched to prevent the invasion of idyllic Naboo by the droid armies of the trade federation. When this fails, the two save that planet's leader, the elected Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman), and retreat to the safety of Corsuscant, the home of galactic senate. Heavy damage forces them to make an unscheduled stop on arid Tatooine, where they enlist the aid of a young Aankin Skywalker, a boy slave with the potential to become a Jedi master. Safely reaching Coruscant, Amidala finds only bureaucratic indifference to her world's plight. Returning to Naboo to lead the fight against the federation, Amidala and the Jedi's enlist the aid of the Gungans, amphibians who live in large cities secreted in Naboo's oceans. While the naboo battle the federation on the ground and in space, and Amidala leads a desperate charge directly into her occupied capital, the Jedis are forced to confront an evil Jedi, an emissary of the long-thought-dead order of the sith Jedi and closer to the power behind the federation than the craven Federation viceroys. Actually, the plot doesn't sound half-bad, if that's enough after a 16 year wait. Less generous might compare it to a mediocre add-on level for the Star Wars computer game, Jedi Knight. The characters are incredibly one-note in comparison with the heroes of the older films. Even the Jedi seem interchangeable with Obi Wan seeming as effortless in his moves as Qui-Gon. The older Jedi is also pretty monochrome considering the dialogue hinting at a rebellious streak (he clashes often with the Jedi counsel). The characters themselves speak in hushed tones and drop names that are familiar to Star Wars fans but will probably baffle anybody else. There's no rebelliousness to any of the characters - where's Han Solo in all of this? The controversies of the alien characters' very human ethnic traits probably wouldn't have come to the for if the human characters themselves had enough character of their own and embodied some of those negative traits themselves. In the older films, we probably wouldn't have noticed the orientalisms of the greedy Watoo or the craven Federation honchos, or minded the comic relief of Jar Jar Binks. Hey everybody's an idiot, everybody makes mistakes, that was what the first trilogy seemed to say. And there's no menace either. Darth Maul is no Darth Vader (though his moves would put the latter evil lord to shame, a true dark lord seldom needs to prove that), and certainly he gets no fun lines ('apology accepted....) The underlying evil is the mysterious Darth Sidious who appears mostly in the form of a hologram beamed to the federation viceroys. But Sidious (whose probably isn't sufficiently mysterious for true star wars fans) doesn't seek to cow his minions either. He issues commands which the viceroys would probably have issued anyway. And there's none of the irony of the first films which here should centre around the manoeuvrings of Senator Palpatine. That name enough lets fans know what's going on, but his insistence that political circumstances require drastic changes should be enough to set off anybody's warning bells no matter how apparently benign his intentions. Instead, the characters all seem so dim, why bother worrying. In one telling scene at the end of the film, the senator - now the Chancellor - meets Anakin Skywalker for the first time. We'll be looking at your progress quite closely, the smiling galactic power holder says. Because I'm such a Star Wars fan, I've pretty much got to do the same with the other films. Perhaps 'Phantom Menace' had to be a botch, something to teach Lucasfilm how not to do a Star Wars film, a learning experience like THX-1138. Hey, there's plenty of time to get things right before Memorial Day Weekend of 2002.",6,0,2,4 August 2014
Star Trek," A great action film in its own right
","So, I've something to tell you all; something not even some of my closest friends are aware of...I'm a MASSIVE Star Trek fan. I've seen pretty much every episode of Star Trek ever made, I've seen every film made (even the one where Kirk fights God!), and I could have a debate with any other Trekkie about who is the best captain (Janeway, naturally). However, in recent years, Star Trek was a franchise on its knees. Since the end of Enterprise in 2005, there was no Star Trek series on TV for the first time in 18 years and the last film, Nemesis, effectively signalled the end of the line for the Next Generation crew. What was to be done? Well step in Lost, Alias and Mission Impossible man J J Abrams to breathe life into the once great franchise. To paraphrase Spock: 'It's Star Trek Jim, but not as we know it.'After the death of his father aboard the USS Kelvin, James T Kirk (Chris Pine) runs wild in his directionless life. Meanwhile, on Vulcan, Spock (Zachary Quinto) is ostracised due to his mixed Vulcan-human parentage. Both are headed for the USS Enterprise, both there is only room for one in the captain's chair.Reinventing Star Trek was never going to be an easy job for J J Abrams and his team, as there was almost forty years of canon behind them. However, from the first frames of the new film, the Star Trek timeline has been completely torn apart, due to the premature death of George Kirk, James Kirk's father. Some fans have complained that this isn't 'real' Star Trek, but it gives the writers the opportunity to completely reinvent the franchise, both in this film and the inevitable sequels. This is an opportunity which Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman seize with both hands, with a major re-writing of the Trek universe occurring. All bets are off from this point onwards, which is what Star Trek needed, after having picky fans moaning for years that x couldn't have happened, as y had happened earlier, but this also affected z. Let the reinvention begin.Despite this reinvention, the focus stays on the relationship between Kirk, the passionate human, and Spock, the logical Vulcan. Chris Pine is good as the cocky, self-assured, skirt- chasing Kirk. Although he doesn't have the same bizarre speech pattern as Shatner, when the words come from his mouth, you believe that he is James T Kirk. The way he holds him self is similar too, especially in a moment where he sits in the captain's chair with his fist under his chin, which is completely reminiscent of Shatner's Kirk. The superb performance though comes from Zachery Qunito as Spock. Not only does he have the advantage of already looking like Leonard Nemoy, there is a real belief that beneath the Vulcan exterior, there is a battle raging between the human and Vulcan aspects of his personality.The rest of the cast put in strong performances as well. Zoe Saldana's Uhura finally has a story arc that Nichelle Nichols would have killed for, Simon Pegg's Scotty and Anton Yelchin's Chevok provide the comic relief, and John Cho's Sulu getting to take part in a pretty tense sword fight. The highlight amongst the supporting cast though is Karl Urban, as Leonard 'Bones' McCoy, who has mastered the mannerisms of the grumpy ship's doctor to perfection. More of him in the eventual sequel would be more than welcome.Abrams has also succeeded in doing something no previous Trek did - Star Trek is now sexy. The original crew we ancient by the time they started making films, and by the time they made Nemesis, the Next Generation crew had too many wrinkles and expanding waistlines. In this film, the hem lines of the skirts are that little big higher, Kirk is caught in bed with a green alien, and the USS Enterprise is very much suited to the iPod generation. The film is also quick paced and action packed, with some fantastic special effects.The Verdict Set expectations to stunning - thanks to J J Abrams, Star Trek will live long and prosper. Oh, and it made me cry...twice",10,2,4,29 July 2014
Iron Man 2," An okay film that mostly works because of Robert Downey Jr
","Iron Man 2 is the sequel to the really rather good Iron Man and is a fun and easily enjoyed action film. Robert Downey Jr is again excellent as playboy technologist Tony Stark/Iron Man and his charisma and wisecracking keep the film rolling along nicely. The plot of Iron Man 2 doesn't really match that of Iron Man which was full of contemporary touches but the basic premise is that a Russian rival to Iron Man emerges and attacks Iron Man who must battle someone nearly as brilliant as he is.That Russian rival is the fantastic Mickey Rourke who puts on a believable Russian accent and looks terrific as the downtrodden son of a genius who lived in poverty and obscurity while the Starks lived in glamour and luxury. The revenge that Rourke's character creates is not much of a plan as it basically involves him fighting and losing in a very public sphere but that is only the setup for the rest of the film where Rourke is given the resources to build a credible threat to Iron Man's prowess.The first showdown between the main villain and main hero is a bit more flash than substance. Rourke's character with electrode whips is awesome but the Monaco GP is not well rendered. Mixing a real event that the audience will be very familiar with and the fantasy can work but it doesn't here. The cars fly about and explode at unrealistic angles and it is all just an excuse for fire. Later action sequences also make suspension of disbelief a little difficult especially when the heroes are cornered and don't just use their otherwise ubiquitous flying abilities to get out of a difficult spot.The action is what is always difficult about sequels. More explosions doesn't necessarily equal better fun. What was terrific about the first Iron Man was the character of Tony Stark. Here he again is excellent but too much time is given to shiny effects. Fortunately there is more than enough of Stark the man to make this a good film. For reasons that become clear during the plot, Stark is living life as if it could end soon and his breakdown is harming his business. The very reliable Pepper Potts picks up the slack and makes actually a much better CEO than Stark does even when he's not having emotional trouble.The father-son relationship stuff is interesting if not overly original. The key plot device contained within the design of a future world city is a little less creative than this reviewer at least came up with but it is still decent fare. The metaplot items are there for those who look hard enough including the Expo which seems a clear reference to Shanghai and Russian-American arms treaties that are currently going through Congress can be read into the Congressional hearing scenes though there's nothing quite as impressive as that cave in Afghanistan from Iron Man 1.The supporting cast are decent. The new Rhodes played by Don Cheadle is a massive upgrade and his is a much better supporting role representing the tension between the collective good as represented by the military, and the good that an individual can do represented by Stark. The plot that surrounds War Machine is very believable. Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer is the comic relief and while he may be a bit fidgety at times, the banter that he is on the receiving end of for the most part is terrific particularly before Congress. Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanoff is not much more than a stereotypical sci fi martial artist but for those who are fans of hers she will have some appeal. Samuel L. Jackson gets slightly more lines than in the first film and he does what he can with limited screen time. Gwyneth Paltrow is again excellent - are her best performances the two Iron Man films? Pepper Potts is thrust into a more senior role in this film and Paltrow brings it off expertly, she has great timing with Robert Downey Jr and their scenes all work very well together.The lighting and effects are good if not mesmerising. The overarching shots of the Stark Expo are beautiful. Not all the visual sequences work well and the Stark Cheerleaders are an unfortunately size zero group of models so it is a relief that they are not featured much. The post-credits scene is just about worth waiting for but only just unlike the first film which was definitely worth waiting for.The film itself could be a 3 or a 4 star outing. It is not as good as the original but is still some nice lighthearted fun made much better by Downey Jr.",6,0,3,6 May 2016
Star Trek Into Darkness," One of the best Star Trek movies of all time.
","A good portion of Trekkies (or Trekkers, depending on one's level of Star Trek obsession) have special affection for episodes of the original TV series that related to Earth and other- Earth cultures visited by the crew of the Enterprise, version 1.0. Some of the shows unfolded in distorted forms of the past, some in the present day of Star Trek's future reality. Director J.J. Abrams recognised the importance of this relationship in his origin- story reboot of the franchise in 2009, and in Star Trek Into Darkness he has made it an even greater touchstone to the roots of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry's defining philosophy from nearly 50 years ago. The human home world is key to the plot of this spectacularly bold leap into Star Trek lore, which cleverly continues along the alternate path that was established as separate from the 'original' Star Trek universe in Abrams's first whiz-bang crack at advancing the mythology. But it's not just Earth that is cool and imperiled in this rendering of adventure in the 23rd century; Into Darkness also plays with the original conceit that Earthlings were member to a multi-species United Federation of Planets ruled by a 'Prime Directive' of noninterference with other civilisations. The conflict comes when rogue elements in the Earth-based Starfleet Command hunger to shift focus from peaceful exploration to militarisation, a concept that is anathema to the crew of the Enterprise and her ongoing mission. The new cast is again inventively reunited, each of them further investing their characters with traits that reveal novel acting choices while staying true to the caricatures that are ingrained in our popular culture. The interplay between Chris Pine as Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Spock is deeper, and Zoe Saldana as Uhura is a solid third in their relationship. John Cho (Sulu), Simon Pegg (Scotty), Anton Yelchin (Chekov), and Karl Urban (McCoy) all have standout roles in the overall ensemble mystique as well as the plot-heavy machinations of this incarnation's narrative. Fortunately, the burdens of the story are well served by some important additions to the cast. Benedict Cumberbatch's Shakespearean aura, ferociously imperious gaze, and graceful athleticism make him a formidable villain as the mysterious Starfleet operative John Harrison. Harrison has initiated a campaign of terror on Earth before leading the Enterprise to even greater dangers in the enemy territory of Klingon-controlled space. That his background may make dedicated Trekkies/Trekkers gasp is just one acknowledgment of the substantial and ingrained legacy Star Trek has borne. There are many references, nods and winks to those with deep reverence for the folklore (some of them perhaps a little too close to being inside- baseball), though the fantastical and continually exciting story stands as an expertly crafted tale for complete neophytes. Another new face is Peter Weller--iconically famous in sci-fi-dom as RoboCop--here playing a steely, authoritative Starfleet bigwig who may also be following a hidden agenda. Not only is he running a covert operation, he's also at the helm of a fearsome secret starship that looms over the Enterprise like a shark poised to devour its prey. Which brings us to the awesome CGI effects driving the dazzling visual style of Into Darkness and the endlessly fascinating cosmos it makes real. The wow factor extends from the opening set piece on an alien world of primitive humanoids, garish vegetation, and a roiling volcano to the finale of destruction in a future San Francisco that is elegantly outfitted with gleaming-spired skyscrapers and all manner of flying vehicles. (London also gets a breathtaking 23rd-century makeover). With a coolness that glistens in every immaculately composed shot, the movie never forgets that humanism and creativity make the myriad design details and hyper-technology pop out as much more than eye candy. The biggest achievement of Star Trek Into Darkness is that it hews to the highest standard of a highly celebrated tradition. Though Kirk and co. may bend it a little, the Prime Directive remains unbroken.",9,2,4,29 July 2014
Spider-Man 2," Ten years later...
","This is absolutely fantastic. This isn't just a sequel that was just as good as the first, it whooped the first movie so hard and it set the bar extremely high for future superhero movies and movies in general to come. Toby Maguire, Alfred Molina, James Franco, Rosemary Harris and extras play their roles wonderfully. Kirsten Dunst not so much.The characters have matured and you'll care for these characters. The story is much deeper and the stakes are higher than they wee in the first film.2 years after the first movie, Peter is suffering to balance his normal life and his crime fighting life. He's low on pay, he doesn't make time for Harry or Mary Jane, Peter is doing poorly in school, he doesn't want to feel this pain anymore. He meets Doc Ock, a scientist invested in his work, but when his experiment goes bad and kills his wife, he avenges her and swears to take down Spider-Man and all of New York by rebuilding his work, but bigger and stronger than ever. Now, Peter has to stand up and do what's right.The action in this movie is just perfect. Not too boring and not too intense. The CGI looks really amazing for 2004 and it hasn't aged yet. I love the fight on the clock tower and on top of the train. Although I did enjoy Danny Elfman's work in the first Spider-Man, he brings his A game to the sequel and it's fantastic. The music is calm, ambient, sad, and frantic when it appropriately needs to be. This is personally my favorite film score. It's just a shame that Elfman had an uncomfortable time composing for the movie.Quoting from the film critic Roger Ebert who didn't enjoy the first Sam Raimi Spider-Man that much, he said that Spider-Man 2 'May be the best superhero movie I have ever seen.' If you have not seen Spider-Man 2, go and watch this. You are doing a massive disservice to yourself by missing out on a compelling story and spectacular fight sequences. 10 years later and I still love this movie so much. This is a special movie, one of my top 10 favorite movies ever. This will go down in the film history books.",10,8,11,2 August 2014
Terminator Salvation," A dark and gritty view of the future
","I had doubts about this film when it was released but despite all the negative feedback that it has received, I really liked it.John Connor, for once, is portrayed as a strong albeit reluctant hero and leader instead of a whiny kid afraid of his future and Christian Bale portrays him very well, capturing the desperation and tortured emotions of a man who has to fulfil a destiny that he is starting to doubt. However, the main focus of this film is given to Marcus Wright, a mystery man portrayed by Sam Worthington who awakens in a post apocalyptic future and tries to figure out how he ended up there. The emotions that the character goes through as he discovers startling revelations about himself are all shown convincingly by Worthington, who brings a tough but also remorseful and vulnerable appeal to Marcus's plight.The third important character in the movie is Kyle Reese, the paradoxical father of John Connor who at this point is only a teenager and portrayed by Anton Yelchin, who played Chekov in the recent Star Trek movie. Reese is shown to be a hero worshipper of the resistance, especially Connor and is compelled to join him, showing traits that would be associated with the character when played by Michael Biehn back in 1984.The story of the film mostly revolves around Connor trying to find Reese but also about Marcus figuring out how he arrived in the wartorn future, and the story works pretty well. The camera style is mostly hand held, which adds a more natural and first hand look to the film and makes it feel more like the audience is in a warzone. Instead of the shiny Terminators from James Cameron's movies, the machines in Salvation are dark, sinister and have a more industrial look to them and there aren't any laser rifles, the only energy weapons in existence are employed by the huge Skynet machines so generally, bullets and missiles are still the favoured artillery of the resistance.Salvation does have its flaws, but for the first Terminator movie to be set entirely in the future, it does a good job of continuing the franchise and making it distinct from the Schwarzenegger-dominated past. While 'Ar-Nulhd' made this franchise a household name, it is refreshing to see new blood taking it in a different direction and the one thing I didn't like about the earlier films was how there was always an epic fight at the beginning of the film before they turned into a long and drawn out chase before another fight at the end. Salvation isn't a chase movie, it's a war movie and it's not ashamed to be different from its predecessors.It could have been better but it is still a good movie, ideal for sci-fi and action fans and on a personal note, it's also fun to guess which scene Christian Bale was doing when he exploded in the now infamous rant against the lighting technician.",7,10,14,24 July 2015
Spider-Man 3," The worst of a great trilogy but that's not all bad
","I didn't care much for this movie after the first viewing. I thought it was hammed up and bloated with special effects that are hallmarks for most summer releases. However, after watching it a few more times the movie has grown on me to the point that I think this was, while not a great masterpiece, a very good film.Sure, there are plot holes and characters that aren't truly developed or fleshed out. Some scenes are down right ridiculous (the night time experiment that spawns Sandman). Yes, some of the CGI borders on cartoonish - the fight between Sandman and Spiderman in the subway comes to mind. And there are clichés, like the old damsel-in-distress scenarios that Mary Jane continually finds herself in. But this is a superhero flick and it's not supposed to be completely realistic. So like Steve Winwood says, just roll with it.What makes this movie rewatchable is the acting and the overall theme of forgiveness as it pertains to Peter Parker and Spiderman. Tobey Maguire, Thomas Haden Church, and of course J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson rise above the hokiness and give great performances. Even James Franco delivers - he just plays a great jerk. And Rosemary Harris makes the best of her limited role as Aunt May and gives a high quality performance. Kirsten Dunst is the weak link again I don't know I just don't like her in these films.The final scene between Spiderman and Sandman was very touching and done so well. In the end, Peter learns how to truly forgive, an act that releases his heart from all of the pain he's been carrying around since his Uncle was murdered. Although I despised this final scene on the first viewing, thinking it was a little too tidy and contrived, I now realize that this was the culmination of the trilogy that finally rounds out who Spiderman truly is. The dark, vengeful corner of Peter's heart which the Symbiote latched onto was exposed and destroyed by the love he demonstrated after Sandman's confession. Peter saw what he would have become - Venom - if he did not confront his hatred and then let it go. This final installment in the series is a fine capstone. In all, one of the better superhero and summer blockbuster movies I've ever seen.",7,6,7,2 August 2014
The Terminator," A classic
","The modern classics of science fiction have been able to infuse crowd- pleasing action scenes with truly thought-provoking and clever concepts. From the chillingly violent social commentary of Paul Verhoeven's Robocop to the stylish and brainy conceits of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, few genres are able to balance the scales so well, yet depressingly so seldom. One such classic was unleashed in 1984 under the title The Terminator. It stars well-known action star Arnold Schwarzenegger and is directed by then-unknown James Cameron, and would soon become a world-wide sensation.Sarah Connor is having a bad day. She's late for work, has tons of awful customers to contend with, and has just learned that two women have been murdered; women with the exact same name as her. If I told you that the murderer was a massive cyborg who was sent back through time to assassinate the eventual mother of humanity's last hero, you'd probably think I was describing something less than brilliant. You'd be wrong. The stunningly clever framework that Cameron provides (he also wrote the script) is only one of the many delightful aspects of The Terminator.Sarah has a hero. Also sent from the future, Kyle Reese appears to thwart the Terminator's attempts and protect Sarah at all costs. Through a seemingly unending series of chases, Reese explains the truth to Sarah, and the two of them promptly set off to... avoid the homicidal robot at all costs. Throw in some unfortunate hooligans who unwisely mock the hulking beast, an oversexed roommate, a disco full of mid-'80s dancers and a barracks full of the most unlucky cops ever caught on film, and you have the ingredients for one dark and violent thrill ride.As the Terminator, Schwarzenegger (Commando) shines. With very few lines of dialogue to worry about, Schwarzenegger can concentrate on that cold dark stare and a truly menacing presence. Though he's played a hero more times than I can count, Arnold delivers his most entertaining performance ever as the unstoppable beast. Linda Hamilton (Children of the Corn) is strong as Sarah, starting out rather ditzy and weak before displaying some real guts later on. As Reese, Michael Biehn (Aliens) hits the right 'action-hero' buttons, and while he falters a bit in the movie's more tender moments, that's okay, because Biehn's a cool actor... and the 'tender moments' last about three minutes in total.With one of the more clever sci-fi screenplays of the last part of the 20th century, and some truly exciting action sequences, Terminatorevery bit as good as you might have heard. While many feel that the sequel is the better film, I'd contend that Terminator 2 was merely more expensive. If you're building yourself a digital sci-fi collection, this movie should definitely be on your Top Ten list.",10,2,3,5 July 2015
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," All good things must come to an end ... Even a grand space opera
","This final entry in George Lucas's STAR WARS movies is often regarded as the weakest of the lot. However, this is not to say that it is a totally worthless entry in the series. On the contrary. Sure, it's not as groundbreaking as its predecessors and a bit more slow-going at times, but RETURN OF THE JEDI still offers a lot to warrant the price of admission.The first third of the movie, where Luke and his friends rescue Han from the palace of Jabba the Hutt, is a classic. Jabba, a truly disgusting blob of bloated flesh who speaks in his own language, not only makes a great villain, but a memorable one, too. It must have been a nightmare to construct this giant puppet, much less give it the spark and life that we see on the finished product. Actually, what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppets for the various members of Jabba's court, including the intimidating, slavering Rancor and scary Sarlaac pit monster. It builds masterfully to its climax and pulls punches all the while.Things get a little bit slower around the second act, where Luke discovers that he and Leia are related by blood and when we travel to the forest planet of Endor, home of the cuddlesome yet stalwart Ewoks. Most of the complaints about RETURN OF THE JEDI that I've read seem to be centered on these furry creatures, in that they somehow disrupt the tone of the saga. I don't totally agree with that, although this moment is probably played out a bit longer than it should. However, their leader, Wicket (played by Warrick Davis) is a delightfully memorable creation, and watching how they handle the Imperial Troops' technology with their simple, natural weapons provides a nice contrast.By the time we get to the third act, though, the pace picks up again, as we intercut between the Ewoks battle against the troops, Lando and the Rebel Forces launching an attack against the Empire's all-new half-completed Death Star, and Luke's final showdown with Darth Vader and the Emperor. The latter ties with the Jabba Palace sequence as the highlight of the movie. Mark Hamill flexes his acting chops once again as Luke Skywalker in these scenes, and watching him as a fully matured Jedi Knight makes for an unforgettable performance. Also, as iconic as James Earl Jones' voice as Darth Vader is, he is rivaled only by the shriveled, crone-like Emperor, played with deliciously raspy, frightening evil by Ian McDiarmid. The tension between this trio heightens the excitement of this climactic moment, which is appropriately darkly lit and menacingly underscored.The STAR WARS movies have always set standards for special effects, and the technical work in RETURN OF THE JEDI can easily hold a candle to its predecessors. The space battle fights are as exhilarating as always, and the speeder bike chase through the forest is a knockout. Of course, given that this movie was made after A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, it probably shouldn't be so surprising that the special effects have reached an even greater level of excellence. The acting is classic STAR WARS fare; Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher all mature and deepen into their roles, and Anthony Daniels provides more hilarious moments as C-3PO. Frank Oz's Yoda only appears in two scenes, but he makes the most of it. And yes, there's also John Williams' music.All told, while RETURN OF THE JEDI falters a little bit in the middle, the first and third acts deliver in style, making this a rather satisfactory finale to one of the greatest sagas ever.In 1997, George Lucas re-released the classic STAR WARS in digitally restored (and revamped) 'Special Editions', which featured added-in effects and/or shots as well as some enhancements. Of the three, RETURN OF THE JEDI appears to have caused the most commotion with STAR WARS fans. Perhaps it can be due to the jarringly out-of-place (albeit funny if you're not so easily offended) 'Jedi Rocks' musical number in Jabba's Palace, which, although technically amazing, does disrupt the flow of the film. However, I DID like the ending montage scenes where we see victory celebrations occurring on the various planets of the galaxy. This DVD version features yet more tweaking--we get to see more montage finale scenes (notably on Naboo, where we hear what sounds like Jar Jar Binks screaming, 'Wesa free!'), and, in what is probably the most controversial change, Hayden Christensen as the specter of Anakin Skywalker in the closing scenes. Probably due to the intense (and unfair) disdain fans have for his somewhat shaky work in EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES it seems inevitable that fans would put this edition down for that alone. However, if you're watching the STAR WARS saga chronologically (and contemplating about it), chances are you may react a little differently. Nonetheless, it is an issue that fans have raised, so it's probably best to be warned beforehand.As nice as it would be to have Lucas release the original versions of these three classic films, he nonetheless stands by what he said about these revamps being the 'definitive' editions of his classic trilogy, and, when viewing the STAR WARS movies altogether as one complete saga (as Lucas intended), it actually makes sense to keep them technically and aurally consistent. The original films will always be engraved in our memories, but these new incarnations are just as much fun, if one can give them a chance.",9,0,0,4 August 2014
Fast & Furious 6," Vin diesel and family bring a non stop thrill ride
","By now the Fast & Furious franchise was made in the eyes of Hollywood, following a massive box office haul for Fast Five, the picture that saw Justin Lin begin the transition from street racing car movie series to explosive action heist franchise, a transformation so many other series' would never be able to pull off five movies in. This one did and, remarkably, the films began to improve in quality - in that regard, Fast & Furious 6--arguably the most bonkers and joyously fun outing for the franchise to date--is the pinnacle of a series seemingly immune to the law of diminishing returns, where Vin Diesel, the late Paul Walker and their crew only seem to become more likable, more charming and more watchable as the franchise grows more confident, more explosive and more wonderfully insane by each film. This is the one where Lin, right from the off, lets everything off the chain - you'll be hard pushed to find anything made for the last few decades that's as gleefully, knowingly dumb, fun and exciting as Fast & Furious 6. For that, it's almost entirely a joy.What was originally known as Fast Six (a better title, arguably) was pre- visualised and written by Lin and series' writer Chris Morgan almost in tandem with the previous picture, hence that movie's post-credits reveal that Michelle Rodriguez's Letty was alive and well, and indeed seemingly had taken a dark turn, after apparently being blown to smithereens two films ago. Her reappearance sparks Diesel's gruffalo Dominic Toretto and his crew--now all freshly minted millionaires after their Rio heist in the last film--to this time team up with The Rock's badass DEA agent Hobbs in tracking down & bringing to heel the terrorist who seemingly has her captive - Luke Evans in full smarm mode as callous Brit-baddie Owen Shaw. Much like Joaquín de Almeida's limp drug baron in Fast Five, he's the villainous weak link here; Lin never much bothers to make him all that menacing and up against beasts of men like Diesel & The Rock, you need a strong villain. No matter because the picture has its eyes elsewhere - yes admittedly the attempts at injecting drama as Diesel monosyllabically tries to protect his 'family', but at the same time the humour and charm is plentiful amongst an ensemble who are very at ease with one another, nobody showboating to gain the limelight but all getting their moments in the spotlight. But forget all that, there's stuff that needs exploding and boy does Lin have fun there - be it a thrilling chase through London in souped up formula one heist cars, a truly insane freeway chase involving a runaway tank and an even more bonkers climactic plane sequence with the longest runway in movie history (honestly, it must be ten miles long!) and a series of fights that culminate in Diesel, literally, executing a flying headbutt. My girlfriend, a huge fan of Diesel and the franchise, admitted she didn't know whether to laugh or cheer. The simple solution is you do both, and Lin actively encourages it.While the end seems to resolve proceedings in a barbecue tinted bow, Fast & Furious 6 then unleashes a wonderful stinger of a post-credits sequence that not only resolve a bizarre continuity niggle (which has basically meant films four, five & six are effectively set before three weirdly) but tees up a thrilling and very recognisable menace for the next picture, which could possibly send a franchise already soaring with gleefully nonsensical and thoroughly enjoyable bravado into the stratosphere. The way it's heading, we are surely destined Fast & Furious 10 to see a geriatric Diesel & The Rock battling alien invaders orbiting the Earth. We can only hope.",8,4,6,8 April 2015
Interstellar," an epic masterpiece
","The much-anticipated Interstellar arrived and immediately created massive explosions, both on film and in the film's response. Many, like myself, found it to be an unprecedented masterpiece. Others have called the film too outlandish or ridiculous, due to its fictitious scientific perspectives.This, of course, also happened with last year's space thriller Gravity-and please take note, Interstellar is not Gravity. It is undeniable that both are true spectacles to watch, but Interstellar is a much more philosophical and emotional film. It is a surreal journey out of our galaxy and feels vividly alive, all while making you contemplate the realities of humanity and the spectrum of emotions we experience, such as love and how its manner of existence cannot be measured in scientific terms. That being said, Interstellar is a very scientific film, yet it is one that brilliantly manages to balance out with emotional character development and astounding space cinematography. It can feel stark or it can feel mind-bending, and its transitions are superbly executed. Spectacular cinematography and original storytelling come as no surprise when watching a film directed by Christopher Nolan, best known for Inception and the Dark Knight trilogy. His entire filmography is astounding and highly recommended (by me, of course), so those hyped for the film due to his involvement flocked to the theatre-along with Matthew McConaughey's huge fan-base since what has been labeled the McConaissance. A ridiculous term, yes, but let's be thankful he's gone from bad rom-coms to the dramatic roles he's thrived in, from Mud to Dallas Buyers Club.The fact of the matter is, as a piece of cinema, Interstellar stands out. It has many odes to 2001: A Space Odyssey and even Star Wars, due to Nolan's love for sci-fi. However, much unlike these films, Interstellar remains grounded outside of alien life. Whether Interstellar dabbles into the supernatural is cause for debate, due to the film's scientific presentation mixed with fiction. This is precisely why Interstellar is an unprecedented experience. It presents real scientific facts and asks tough philosophical questions, yet remains a grippingly lucid sci-fi film.Discussing Interstellar feels much like presenting someone with a gift and not wanting to give any hints as to what it is. The film's layers are cleverly peeled off and its progression is so beautifully carried out that there is truly nothing like experiencing it and absorbing its concepts and theories after it is over. I suppose I've delayed discussing Interstellar's plot because it is a film in which every plot point is important and imaginative, and giving anything away would feel like giving away a meaningful piece. I will, nevertheless, present you with an introduction and very minor synopsis of the film.Interstellar follows Cooper, played by McConaughey, living with his father-in-law, son, and daughter, in a desolate Earth filled with extreme dust storms. Homes and human lungs are filled with dust as people struggle to survive with limited resources in a deteriorating, and depleting Earth. Cooper is a farmer who once flew for NASA before the Earth's descent, and his crops-along with crops around the entire globe-are dying due to the earth's excessive drought and dust plagues. Upon making entirely unexpected discoveries, Cooper is faced with making the difficult decision of leaving his family for the exploration of planets sustainable of human life in a galaxy outside of our own. With the spectacular Anne Hathaway at his side, not to mention a sarcastic clunky robot, Interstellar becomes a humorous experience as much as it is intellectually stimulating and incredibly moving. This is a film that simply cannot be missed due to its intricacy, beauty, and manner of evoking a response from all those who experience it.",10,1,7,12 November 2014
Captain America: The First Avenger," A good old fashioned superhero film
","Set in 1942 at the height of World War 2, Chris Evans () stars as the puny yet courageous American Gi wannabe, Steve Rogers. But fortune shines on him as Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci -The Hunger Games) who is recruiting for a special top secret experiment, Project Rebirth, see's beyond Rogers physical failings to give him a shot as a candidate, much to the dismay of Col. Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones -) who doesn't see the same as the good Doctor does. Eventually being the chosen candidate, Rogers undergoes an experiment to change him from a puny regular Joe into a super human solider....Captain America is born.Overall, Captain America: The First Avenger is a watchable bit of entertainment first & foremost, but does have it's failings. The Story starts out very well & introduces us into how this physically under sized man with a big heart becomes Captain America, in the opening 30 minutes. But it then drops from 5th gear into 1st gear, as Captain America is used as a propaganda tool for the war. Which is kinda the calm before the storm i guess. As the film then tries to get back into 5th gear with its action sequences, but doesn't fascinate as much as it did at the beginning imo, as it gradually pushes into 3rd & 4th gears.Although we have to respect that the hero will ultimately win out, we could had been respected a bit more with the action sequences. The enemy 'storm troopers' who look like something out of toting big futuristic weapons, yet have the armour of a gnat, as they fall over like rolling pins doesn't elude too much in the believability stakes. But i guess this is what we have to swallow with it being an action hero flick.I was impressed with the way they CGI'd Chris Evans as a puny looking weakling, then un-CGI'd him, i've not seen much of the guy, but initially i thought the actor was a stand in & then Evans would appear later, colour me impressed. The rest of the CGI was well done too. The 1940's setting also looked good & a nice change from modern based adventures. Now, not being a comic book reader myself, but having enjoyed the recent Marvel film offerings, i did appreciate the subtle introductions/hints of the other Marvel comic characters, like Iron Man's father & Samuel L. Jacksons, Nick Fury(more astute fans may have noticed more than i). Which all lead into the latest Marvel comic blockbuster, Avengers Assemble, which the film made very enticing by it's ending.The acting was pretty good on the whole, Evans was solid but lacks the screen presence of true Hollywood stars imo, Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci, Toby Jones, Haley Atwell, Sebastian Stan & Dominic Cooper all added gravitas to the movie. Hugo Weaving was impressive, or over hammy depending on how you see it, as the villain Johann Schmidt aka The Red Skull.In conclusion, Captain America is an enjoyable watch despite it's few failings, it's not the very best Marvel comic movie i've seen, but it certainly isn't the worst.",7,0,0,4 May 2016
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," thirteen years on, still one of the greatest fantasy films ever made
","Sixty years ago, the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins came into possession of a magic ring. When he decides to leave his home in the Shire and retire, he finds it curiously difficult to leave the ring behind. Disturbed, the wizard Gandalf investigates and discovers that Bilbo's trinket is actually the One Ring of legend, which the Dark Lord Sauron needs to complete his return to power. Bilbo's cousin Frodo has to take the Ring on a long and arduous journey across Middle-earth to the volcano known as Mount Doom, deep within Sauron's land of Mordor, the only place where it can be destroyed.Back in 1999, when Peter Jackson began filming The Lord of the Rings, there was an expectation of failure. A thousand-page-long book adapted into three three-hour movies by a director whose biggest previous movie had been a minor ghost comedy starring Michael J. Fox? And on a budget of only $90 million apiece at a time when $200 million+ budgets for such epic films were becoming more commonplace? It seemed like a recipe for disaster.Against the odds, Jackson pulled it off. The trilogy as a whole is a remarkable work, translating Tolkien's vision onto the screen with - for the most part - respect and integrity. There are missteps, mistakes and some ill-conceived changes, but these are mostly restricted to the second and third films in the sequence. The Fellowship of the Ring, on the other hand, is moved from page to screen with enviable skill.The main key to the film's success is the casting. Elijah Wood may be a lot younger than Frodo in the novel, but he sells Frodo's mix of book- learned wisdom with a lack of practical experience with wide-eyed enthusiasm. Representing the old guard, veteran actors Ian McKellen, Ian Holm and Christopher Lee bring their roles of Gandalf, Bilbo and Saruman to life with presence and gravitas. The actors are pretty much all excellent, even Cate Blanchett as she struggles with a curiously-written interpretation of Galadriel. Marton Csokas is probably the film's weakest acting link as Celeborn, but given he has about twenty seconds of screen time, this is not a major issue. I must also admit to not being altogether convinced by Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn the King, but as Strider the Ranger in this first film he is superb.In terms of scripting and changes from the books, some key sequences are missing. Tom Bombadil is gone (which is a wise move), as are the barrow- wights (which is more regrettable) and other elements are compressed (the journey from the Shire to Bree, which covers dozens of pages in the book, happens instantly on-screen) or eliminated altogether (Fatty Bolger, the 'Fifth Hobbit', is exorcised from events). Other events that happened in the book off-page or only in flashback occur here in their correct chronological order, such as Saruman's confrontation with Gandalf at Isengard.For the most past these changes are well-judged, even if some fan- favourite moments are left out. For a three-hour movie the pacing is generally excellent, with a good mix of exposition, character-building moments and action set pieces. The movie's effects are impressive, with CGI being held back and used only when absolutely necessary, with miniatures often employed to give physical locations a sense of presence and weight. Whilst clearly resulting from budgetary restrictions, this prevents the film getting buried under fake-looking CGI and means it still has more convincing effects than the recent first Hobbit movie, which feels a little silly.It's difficult to pick a stand-out moment from the film. The Black Riders pursuing the Hobbits is an evocative moment, as is the confrontation on Weathertop and the flooding at the Fords of Bruinen. The outstanding sequence is probably the descent through Moria, which features both excellent character moments (such as Gandalf's conversation with Frodo when they discover that Gollum is pursuing them), humour (Pippin's encounter with a skeleton on a well), action (the battle with the cave troll in the chamber of Mazarbul) and tragic horror (Gandalf's last stand on the bridge of Khazad-dumb). The whole sequence is a joy to watch.The film missteps a little near the end: the trip to Lorien, where the Fellowship regroups after Moria, made sense in the book but in the film it dangerously comes close to killing the pace of the movie altogether. This is not helped by the somewhat bizarre characterisation of Galadriel. Jackson is to be commended for trying to make the longueur work, but ultimately it feels like it's delaying the film's climax too much at the moment it should be ramping up towards it. Fortunately, in the cinematic edition it's a fairly brief sequence. Events culminate in the epic battle on Amon Hen, with Sean Bean delivering a stand-out performance during Boromir's last stand and Sean Astin's Sam getting his first notable moments in the film's cliffhanger ending.The movie's success is furthered by some truly remarkable production design and the quite astonishing soundtrack by Howard Shore, which must rank as one of the finest movie soundtracks of all time.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring remains, thirteen years on, one the finest fantasy movies ever made. The writing, acting and effects work all combine and work in tandem with one another to produce something very special, something that Peter Jackson has struggled to replicate ever since.",10,6,6,17 December 2014
Man of Steel," Man of steel - The superman of the 21st century
","I'm not a comic book aficionado. I grew up with cartoons in the 1960's and 1970's and leaned more to DC Comics than Marvel, but even I had to say that up to the BATMAN re- boot with the Nolan Trilogy, Marvel films were better action and better stories. But MAN OF STEEL comes up to bat and while it might not be a grand slam, it is certainly a home run.Zach Snyder and Christopher Nolan have added a new layer of complexity to the Superman storyline, while still allowing for character development, action, and a storyline that stays true to the original mythology. Henry Cavill (Superman/Clark Kent), Amy Adams (Lois Lane; she had an appearance as a villain in 'SMALLVILLE'), Michael Shannon (Zod), and Diane Lane (Martha Kent) all give great appearances in their roles, big or small. Russell Crowe is a fantastic and very believable Jor-El; let's hope they can re-utilise him in future DC Comics/SUPEMAN/Justice League sequels.MOS is a unique film compared to previous Superman story lines. From the 1951 'ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN' through the cartoons of the 1960's and 1970's to the 1978 SUPERMAN film with Christopher Reeve to the recent SMALLVILLE TV series, every showing of Superman has shown Superman advancing in chronological order, usually from birth/his appearance on Earth. But MOS took a different tack which makes the film very interesting, where series of flashbacks (like dream sequences) from Clark's time on Earth are interspersed with the main storyline. So you see a very young Clark in school, an adolescent Clark saving a school bus, an early-20's Clark working at a bar, Clark on a fishing vessel, and the death of Jonathan Kent (great performance by Kevin Costner) at different times in the film, seemingly popping up at random. It accentuates the importance of these events in the younger Clark's life and tells the story of his time on Earth in a different perspective. The ordering of the appearances fills in the blanks and makes the story arc of the Last Son Of Krypton riveting and appealing to those who already know the Superman mythology (which is probably most of us). Very well done !!As for the movie itself: Jor-El and Zod's relationship is dramatic and a new twist on Zod's megalomania; it is too bad they couldn't explore this in further detail or go back in time when they were strong allies (perhaps in a sequel?). I have always thought that a story arc focusing solely on what happened with Jor-El/Zod and the rest of Krypton before the planetary cataclysm would have made for a great storyline. The darker tone of MOS would have lent itself more to such a story (more so than the Kryptonian Council scenes at the beginning of the 1978 SUPERMAN movie). Pay attention to the difference in Clark's tone and attitude toward his parents when he is complaining to Jonathan Kent about following in his footsteps as a farmer, and later in the movie when he goes after Zod for 'threatening his mother.'Lois Lane's relationship to Superman is introduced in a different fashion than in previous incarnations of Superman. Another positive; the writers and producers stayed true to the basic Superman story arc but knew they needed a few 'changeups' to make this different to captivate the audience, besides the darker tone. Perry White's character is much less interesting (and funny) than Jackie Cooper's portrayal in the 1978 film. But if Lawrence Fishburne is OK with it, who am I to complain ?The ending has plenty of action, and the complaints by some that there is too much rock- 'em-sock-'em action is a bit off base. This isn't the BATMAN trilogy where you are dealing with a brilliant martial arts detective, you are talking about super-powered beings whose dense molecular structures are magnified probably 1 trillion-fold by the power of Earth's Sun. The complaint about SUPERMAN RETURNS was that the trailers had most of the action and the movie had very little follow-up. That isn't the case in MOS. Even little things are accentuated, as this film pays attention to detail: check out Clark's eyes when he helps heals Lois' injury. Nice touch !'MAN OF STEEL' is a great film in its own right and a worthy successor to the 1978 movie which was one of the biggest box office hits of the 1970's. Some have commented that the ticket sales for MOS were disappointing, but it is possible that the SMALLVILLE TV series (ended 2011) and SUPERMAN RETURNS (2006) both dampened any pent-up demand for a successful and new version of the story. BATMAN BEGINS was 8 years after the final George Clooney semi-camp Batman movie but the Nolan Trilogy didn't kick into high gear until THE DARK KNIGHT hit in 2008. MOS did better than BATMAN BEGINS by almost 50%. When THE DARK KNIGHT followed up BATMAN BEGINS 3 years later it more than doubled the earlier film. One wonders if there was a Superman-only follow-up (instead of the rumoured Batman-Superman 'Justice League' hookup) if it could springboard on the first film's success and reach the levels of the 2nd and 3rd films in the Nolan Trilogy. Looks like we'll never know, so let's hope Ben Affleck and the scriptwriters don't screw up the successor to MAN OF STEEL.",10,4,7,16 August 2014
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," A necessary and fitting buildup to the grand conclusion
","Walking out of the screening, one of my friends remarked that he hated this Harry Potter film, stating it is the 'worst' in the series. I disagree, but understand exactly why he thinks this way. As anyone who has read the book knows, a large part of the seventh book is buildup towards the definite battle that awaits. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt. 1 is just buildup.If you have read the book, you will enjoy this film as it is faithful to the spirit of the book; if you know Harry simply through the films, you might be disappointed. For it is filmed with camping in deserted locations, forests, and other odd locations to escape from Voldermort's grasp. This is really why some critics absolutely hate this film as they can not fathom the amount of buildup this film does. However, if they want to criticise anyone, they should critique Rowling as this is a faithful adaption of her book.Radcliffe and Grint are great as always, but the welcome surprise is Emma Watson whose acting has gotten better and better, and she reaches a new peak. She balances each relationship very decisively , putting different emotional layers in treating Harry and Ron. In addition, the landscapes are as gorgeous as ever, and the special effects have become surprisingly better-especially Voldermort's snake which sent chills through my spine. The emotion the film induces does something that the book never did for me. It takes it out of this magical world, and into the real world, and makes the evil present in Harry's World seem like the fear many people battling evil might have felt in Germany, during the 1930's and forties. Hermione's attempt to save her parents from the hands of evil give us another view in this world which almost mirrors us in terms of what these people go through to wipe this evil horror.The deathly Hallows may be a boring film for those unfamiliar with the book, but for the readers of this tale it is the most faithfully done adaptation. Sure, the film does not succeed on a film lover's point of view, but one must remember any disappointment felt with this film will evaporate with the menacing, blood spilling second part.",10,1,3,17 August 2014
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines' Rises To New Levels
","The film picks up a number of years after the last feature as we see John Connor (Stahl), future leader and Saviour of the human race, in his mid twenties (I'd guess), living 'off the grid' since the events from the last film (if you haven't seen the previous two films I don't know what the heck you're doing here, but whatever...). Turns out 'judgment day' was not averted, as initially thought at the end of the 2nd film, but only postponed, as Skynet is around in some form, as indicated by the arrival of a Terminator robot, a model T-X played by Loken. It seems now the future is populated by really hot and sexy blonde robots with definite feminine characteristics...homina, homina...soon after we see another Terminator arrive, the muscled one we're more accustomed to, played by Arnold. Seems the T-X model, or Terminatrix Bot has been sent back to target Connor, but if it can't get to him, it's supposed to go after those who would be his lieutenants, including that of Kate Brewster (Danes), whose father, played by Andrews, just happens to be some military bigwig in charge of the program which will eventually become Skynet, the artificial intelligence that will eventually take over the world, exterminating the human threat. Make sense? Probably not...anyway, given this new threat, someone from within the resistance from the future decided to send back an Arnold robot to protect whomever needed protecting, but its task a difficult one given the sophistication of the T-X model, which is essentially an enhanced logic weapons systems cybernetic combat infiltration unit with nanotechnological transjectors inside a titanium battle chassis surrounded by a mimetic poly alloy...whew! So what does all that mean? Well, it can manipulate machines under computer control, tap into communications systems, and produce weaponry from within, including a wicked plasma cannon from its arm, among other things. Things aren't looking so good for John (or the human race, for that matter), but did I mention the Terminatrix is really hot?Given the fact Terminator 2 made as much as it did at the box office, I'm not surprised someone decided to continue on with the franchise, despite the fact the story had been pretty much wrapped up at the end of the second film. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines does try to fit itself within the continuity of the previous two films, and, on the surface it succeeds, but once you start picking at the loose threads, there are inconsistencies (then again, when we're talking about time travel, who's to say what could and couldn't happen?). Now, I'm not going to go through and relate all the bits I thought out of place as I'm sure many have already done so, and done so a lot better than I could have, but I will say if you take this movie at face value (a straight up action film), you'll probably have a lot more fun. There was one bit that really bothered me, though, and that was when John, Kate, and the Arnold Bot were trying to contact Kate's father, who just happened to be secured away in some top-secret military installation. One minute they're driving towards the place and the next they're inside, talking to Kate's father...I suppose the Arnold Bot could have bypassed the security somehow, but it all seemed rather convenient, especially given the circumstances. I did like the whole bit about a widespread virus running through the Internet, where it came from, and its ultimate purpose. The characters in this film seemed to take a backseat to the action, as none are really developed as much as they were in the previous films. Perhaps the filmmakers were relying on the character development already out there from the earlier films, but given so few characters carried over, this didn't work out so well. One of the biggest weaknesses in the film, in my opinion, was that of Stahl's character of John Connor. There seemed to be an awful lot of inconsistencies indicating perhaps this wasn't the same John Connor as was in the previous movie. I'm not a big fan of Stahl (he reminds me too much of Giovanni Ribisi, whom I care even less for), but I thought he did pretty well in the film Sin City (2005). As far as Danes, well, she looked good, but her performance was limited by her role, as it was written. While the plot and the characters may have been half-baked, at least the action was balls out. My favourite bit involved a car chase sequence featuring a gigantic crane truck barreling through city streets, causing massive amounts of destruction. Another great bit was when the two Terminators were fighting each other within the military base, and the Arnold Bot uses a urinal as an offensive weapon. The first time I saw this film and the ending was presented I found myself saying 'What the f***?', but, after watching it again last night it did seem to make sense in terms of the story presented. All in all I thought this a great action film, but in terms of a sequel to the Terminator series, it was so-so...I'd agree with Cameron that there really wasn't anything left to tell in the story, but if there's a chance to make money, you know Hollywood will capitalize.",7,1,2,19 July 2015
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Hasta LA Vista Baby
","The quintessential sequel, the quintessential sci-fi actioner & one of the greatest films ever made, James Cameron's follow-up story to his breakthrough classic is such a huge upgrade over its predecessor that it ends up decimating the 1984 original in all filmmaking departments with effortless ease, and remains one of the most influential, entertaining & breathtaking action extravaganzas to grace the silver screen.A highly irresistible, pulse-pounding, high-octane, full-throttled & top- gear action spectacle that's filled with some of the most dangerous, daring & heart-stopping stunts ever captured on the film celluloid, Terminator 2: Judgment Day is the perfect definition of a worthy sequel that presents its renowned director at the peak of his gifted talents, is the finest work of his illustrious career, and its influence on its genre, visual effects & pop culture surpasses even the reach of its predecessor.The story of Terminator 2: Judgment Day follows the aftermath of the events that transpired in The Terminator and continues the journey of Sarah Connor & her 10-year old son, John Connor; the future leader of human resistance in the war against the machines. After failing to eliminate Sarah during its first attempt, Skynet sends a much more advanced Terminator back in time to kill John when he's still a child while another saviour from the future arrives whose only mission is to protect John & ensure his survival at all costs.Written, produced & directed by James Cameron, the improvements present in this sequel are evident from the film's opening moments with more enhanced visuals, larger-than-life action & one mind-blowing sequence after another. I've always admired Cameron because he's one of the very few filmmakers who understands what great action is all about, knows how to expand upon the original instead of rehashing the same events & has the talent to accomplish not just his own artistic ambitions but also the expectations of the mainstream audience without compromising with the quality.Also, in my opinion, a sequel has no reason to exist unless it can improve upon the original and it's usually why I'm skeptical about most of them. Cameron seems to know this better than anyone for he has proved it not once but twice already; first with Aliens; the action-packed follow-up to Ridley Scott's Alien & then with this second chapter to the film that launched his career. And despite the major upgrades in action & other technical aspects, the story retains the high-quality content of the original, exhibits extensive character depth & is brilliantly paced from start to finish.From a technical standpoint, Terminator 2 is a marvel of genre filmmaking in every sense of the word. Production Design team does a commendable job with its refined sets, locations are nicely selected for filming especially when it comes to action scenes, Cinematography makes expert use of its camera in keeping the action clearly visible with its cleverly chosen angles, makes the drama more immersive with its controlled movements, and with its precision use of colour hues & lighting provides a rich texture to the whole film that further enhances the whole experience.Editing is easily one of its strongest aspects for every sequence paves the groundwork for the next scene in line, the flow of events is incredibly smooth & relaxed, and the pace is so methodically handled that its 136 minutes of runtime simply flies by. Even Brad Fiedel comes up with a more evolved, pulsating & fitting score that beautifully integrates into the film's narrative and has a firm grip on the viewers' emotions from start to finish. But where Terminator 2 sets an entirely new benchmark is in its visual effects, sound design & action choreography, all of which are simply groundbreaking.Coming to the performances, Terminator 2 features a solid cast in Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick & Edward Furlong, with the reprising actors improving upon their performances of the last chapter while new ones instantly making a mark in their given roles. Schwarzenegger returns as the cyborg sent from the future but with a new mission & while T-800 isn't the same relentless assassin in this sequel, there isn't a moment when we aren't aware of what he's capable of. Schwarzenegger gets to explore new dimensions of his character this time and does a spectacular job at it for T-800 isn't just badass in this picture but also cool, charismatic & heroic.Linda Hamilton reprises her role of Sarah Connor and builds upon her earlier rendition with a stronger performance as her character exhibits a more evolved & tougher persona, which Hamilton captures splendidly. Edward Furlong is introduced as John Connor & while he can be annoying on few occasions, it's a dream debut nonetheless. And finally we have Robert Patrick who plays T-1000; a highly advanced cyborg who's far superior to T-800 model & is virtually the most lethal, unstoppable, indestructible & invincible Terminator in existence. Cameron has written the part of this antagonist really well and Patrick's added inputs help greatly in making his character one of the greatest film villains of all time.On an overall scale, Terminator 2: Judgment Day is blockbuster filmmaking at its finest for it sets a very high standard for its genre(s) that hasn't been equalled ever since, remains one of the most enjoyable, entertaining & jaw-dropping works of sci-fi action with an extremely high repeat value, is a perfect example of a sequel that surpasses the original in all aspects, and is a landmark achievement of genre filmmaking that has had a lasting impact on multimedia & pop culture. The best film of its year, one of the most memorable films of the 1990s & one of cinema's greatest triumphs, James Cameron's conclusion to his Terminator saga is an unprecedented, unrivalled & undisputed masterpiece that comes one hundred percent recommended",10,2,4,8 July 2015
Spider-Man," Web slingers unite
","After 25 years in development hell, Sam Raimi(The Evil Dead, Darkman) and Columbia Pictures brought Spiderman to the big screen in the Spring of 2002. The film does justice to Marvel's Spiderman comic books and it's fun to watch even if you've never read a comic book. Tobey MacGuire plays Peter Parker and his alter ego Spiderman. During a field trip, a radioactive spider escapes from its cage and it bites Parker on the hand! The spider bite gives him superpowers such as a 'Spideysense' and the ability to shoot webs. In the comic book, Peter uses 'prosthetic web shooters'. In the Spiderman movies, the web shooters are organic. Peter Parker has a crush on Mary Jane(Kirsten Dunst), a redheaded girl who goes to the same high school. After Peter's uncle Ben Parker(Cliff Robertson) is killed by a mugger, Peter fights crime as Spiderman. Spiderman has to help people as the malevolent, psychotic, power-hungry Green Goblin(Willem Dafoe) kills people in New York. TV's Spiderman and his Amazing Friends(1982) and a Spiderman T-shirt that I wore in 1985 were my first exposure to Spiderman. Although, Spiderman has been around since the 1960's. A live action Spiderman movie project was passed around from studio to studio. Cannon Films had the Spiderman filmmaking rights at one time. At one time, James Cameron was going to direct the film. A movie poster and a movie trailer with the World Trade Center was used to promote the Spiderman movie in 2001. Both disappeared after the Terrorist Attack on September 11th, 2001. Spiderman(2002) is jam-packed with patriotism and flag-waving. The visual effects in Spiderman have been criticized for looking rubbery and cartoonish, but they get the job done. The visual effects in Spiderman 2(2004) and Spiderman 3(2007) make it up to us by having eye-popping, glossy visual effects. The late 'Macho Man' Randy Savage plays a wrestler that Peter Parker fights in an arena. Lucy Lawless, Bruce Campbell, and director Sam Raimi make cameos in the film. Tobey Maguire an inspired choice for Peter Parker/Spiderman. He has to be mild-mannered, strong, and good-looking at the same time. Kirsten Dunst i hate as Mary Jane there's no chemistry between her and Tobey but the upside down kissing scene is a classic. James Franco is quite good as Peter's friend, Harry Osborne. Willem Dafoe plays Norman Osborne and the Green Goblin. Rosemary Harris plays Aunt May and J.K. Simmons plays Daily Bugle chief J. Jonah Jameson. Danny Elfman's Spiderman music score is good. Spiderman was spoofed on The Simpsons and the 'Weird Al' Yankovic song 'Ode to a Superhero'. John Dykstra(Star Wars, Batman Forever) crafted the visual effects for Spiderman(2002).",8,0,1,2 August 2014
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Magical
","'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' is easily my favourite of the three Harry Potter films so far. The real magic of this film is that, simply put, it is the first in the series to really make optimal use of the medium of film to look at some different aspects of the world of Harry Potter.In the movie, we see things that were not in the book, but could have been. From a simple and quick scene of the boys in Gryffindor trying candies that make them sound like different animals, to the very vocal shrunken heads that show up on the Knight Bus and in the town of Hogsmeade, and to the subtle (and not-so-subtle) changes made to Hogwarts itself, we get little glimpses into this world that we haven't seen before, even if we've read all of the books cover to cover and back again.With that in mind, 'Azkaban' is remarkably faithful to the book. The core of the story is there, and the characters really come to life. Some of the details are glossed over, and one of our family's favourite minor characters, Sir Cadogan, is given short shrift (take heart, he does show up in the deleted scenes). Nevertheless, the humour of the book and the essential nature of the characters and the story are captured in this film almost perfectly.Running heavily throughout this film is the theme of time. Anyone who's read the book already knows why this is, but from the moment the students get to Hogwarts one can't help but notice the gigantic pendulum swinging back and forth in the entrance hall, or the massive gears of a clock, always moving, in the big window at the front of the school. The change of seasons is also handled in a very clever visual motif. In the last 20 minutes or so of the film time is an even stronger presence, as even the music takes on a steady rhythm, like the ticking of the clock. Time, its passage and its usage, is a very important theme to this story, and the film makes good use of it.In terms of the technical aspects, 'Azkaban' also makes a standout impression. The visual effects really do the story justice, and are seamless rather than a distraction. Even more than that, the design of the film really captures both the wonders and the horrors of Harry Potter's world. The changes made to the look of Hogwarts work to its benefit, and the design of Trelawney's classroom fits her personality perfectly. The design of the Dementors, on the other hand, is absolutely blood-chilling -- even more frightening than I had imagined them. The acting, particularly that of the kids, has undergone vast improvements, and the addition of talents like Emma Thompson as Professor Trelawney and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black certainly didn't hurt. Perhaps the biggest and most pleasant surprise was David Thewlis, who portrayed Professor Lupin perfectly.I've been pretty harshly critical about John Williams' music for the previous two Potter films, as I felt that his work for them was bland and unremarkable, and the series deserved better. Finally, for the third film, we got it. Williams' music for 'Azkaban' is rich and adds depth to the story. At times he adopts a classical, almost baroque style in the music, while at others he allows it to be more whimsically modern. The music for the last twenty minutes or so, with the aforementioned theme of time worked into it, is one of the best pieces I've heard from Williams in a long time. My hat is off to John Williams for finally giving Harry Potter the music he deserves.Alfonso Cuaron, who takes the directing helm for 'Azkaban,' has really done something amazing. Throughout the film he walks the fine line between the scary aspects of the story (very scary indeed) and the humorous ones (very funny indeed), so that neither seems out of place, even when they're happening in the same scene. His attention to detail is outstanding, and the result is that we see in 'Azkaban' many complex scenes with multiple events happening at once. The main characters may be having a discussion, while in the same room we see ghosts chasing one another in the Headless Hunt, or chairs putting themselves on a table, and remarkably it never gets confusing or overwhelming. These things add to the effect I mentioned earlier, of exploring the world of Harry Potter more fully while still telling the story. For the first time in this film one really gets a feeling for the richness and breadth of that world, as we have already seen in the books.My family and I enjoyed the first two Harry Potter films immensely, but for me, 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' is the first movie in the series that I felt truly lived up to the book, not only because it stayed true to the essentials of the story, but also because it felt free to explore new aspects of the world of Harry Potter. Part of the magic of the books is that they give us new wonders to enjoy, and finally we have a film that weaves the very same spell.",10,0,1,17 August 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man," A reboot too soon but still good
","This review may seem a little paradoxical, but basically, here's the gist for me: the first half was messy, the second half was rushed, and it did not significantly add or achieve anything over and above Sam Raimi's original movie to necessarily warrant a full reboot like this. That being said, the whole thing kind of came together in a way that was fun, and decent overall. As a whole, I liked the movie in and of itself, but it left a whole lot to be desired.First, the overall plot and pacing. The first half, as I've already set, is just a mess. It is a mish-mash of scenes trying to establish the angst and character of Peter Parker while trying to lay some backstory suggesting a conspiracy involving Peter's parents. The problem with the conspiracy backstory is that it was never really fleshed out, and just seemed to be something tossed in to try to add some intrigue to the movie. Considering Dr. Connors' background with Richard Parker, I am surprised there wasn't a whole lot more of Peter trying to learn about his dad from him. I would have expected more bonding between them, or something, so it just didn't feel real to me.Many of the scenes in that first half of the film are just alternative takes on similar scenes in Sam Raimi's original Spider-Man film. We've got to have the shots of Flash picking on Peter, we've got to have the big argument with Uncle Ben to set up the big guilt trip later, we've got to have the Oscorp lab with the creepy experiments, the cute girl that is interested in Peter even though he's a dork, etc., etc. The scenes that were truly original to this version mostly dealt with a little prologue showing the Parkers, which seemed like it was setting up a payoff later in the film, which, sadly, never materialized.Then, after limping along for an hour, it was if the filmmakers decided to change gears, and we get about ten minutes of transition time where EVERYTHING seemingly happens all at once: the spiderbite, the costume, the webbing, the murder of you-know-who, the guilt trip, etc. - In particular, the webbing and the costume kind of came out of nowhere. One minute, nothing, the next second, he's full blown Spider-Man, and it felt very rushed.Then, the second half was a rehash of the trite old plot line - 'Hey, I'll experiment on myself. Hey, I'm a monster now!' Because the movie limped along for that first hour, the second hour has a lot of ground to cover, in order to establish the Lizard as a baddie, and consequently it felt very rushed. Three separate battles with the Lizard, with only mere minutes of screen time between each one, setting up the next battle, kind of became tedious for me.The acting was good. All of the cast members did their jobs very well. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, as Peter and Gwen, really clicked on screen. Martin Sheen did a good job as Uncle Ben, but I really wish that relationship would have been developed a little more. As it was, I never really felt any fondness or closeness between Peter and Uncle Ben, as they were always bickering with each other. Raimi did a much better job with that relationship in the first Spider-Man movie.The action sequences were really cool. Although, by now, all these big budget action sequences are becoming the same. If you don't mind watching two CGI characters have CGI battles, it's fun. The web swinging sequences were effectively rendered too.So, overall, I would say, fun movie, though it didn't contribute meaningfully enough to the lore to warrant the reboot. We saw all of this just a few years ago when Raimi released the first 'Spider-Man.' And since the trend now seems to be to make three movies and reboot, I'm sure we'll be getting a new origin story in just a few years. After all, look no further than the fact that they're already rebooting Batman again. That's the SECOND reboot in just the past handful of years. It's starting to become a bit tedious, you know.",7,0,1,2 August 2014
The Fast and the Furious," the first ride
","It's strange that one of the best franchises in movie history started off with Vin Diesel stealing a bunch of VHS players. Make no mistake about it, under the corny dialogue, awful soundtrack, horrid direction, and a general sheen that makes it clear that this is a 2001-ass movie from 2001, this is also at its core a Fast & Furious movie. So in preparation for the impending release of Furious 7, let's look how the film that started it all held to the franchise's tenants of Life, Cars, and Family.Life: Although the 'I live my life a quarter mile at a time' mantra is corny, I think it plays well in the streets of the film's world. A world where respect is everything, but that respect has to be both earned and backed-up with actions. It means taking big risks, knowing your priorities, but also living in freedom of choosing your own destiny. While Dom's arc here is learning to live with that freedom, by his own code of honour, and the consequences and all it entails, Brian's arc is about earning that respect and choosing how far he's willing to go to get it. It may not seem a lot, but I think it speaks a lot to their arcs throughout the entire series, especially when you see how awkward Brian is at the beginning, knowing he'll eventually become one of the coolest and most respected white dudes on the planet later.Cars: Although originally envisioned as a movie about street racing, the film actually grinds to a halt when people stop to race. Director Rob Cohen is as bad at directing as he is at acting (As that Pizza Hut guy annoyed by street racers) and manages to make the races both boring, but also hideous to look at. He adds several horrible effects to each racing scene to convey speed and excitement, both CGI and otherwise, but it never feels, or looks right, and they also never sound right. Seriously, when people aren't talking, Cohen turns the film into some god-awful 'nu-metal' or 'rapcore' music video. All he needed was to add some crunk, and he would have completed a devil's threesome of best-forgotten 00s music genres. What is good however is how Cohen handles the heist, which the series would eventually realise is much more interesting than racing, which they prove here. Cars drive under trucks, people jump from cars to trucks, and people jump from trucks to cars. It's nothing the series wouldn't do better later, but it's still edge-of-your seat classic action, complete with a last minute save by our hero, Brian. As for the cars themselves, the only truly memorable one is Dom's classic Charger, which plays heavily into his back story.Family: Again, this movie is strangely best when people are talking, and not racing. The film obviously establishes the code of honour and of respect, but it's also about family, which the series is ultimately about. I forgot that they go into Dom's back story here, and why family is so important to him as he establishes one in the absence of his father, while being welcoming to all who gravitate towards him. His code of family really drives the film, and his accepting of Brian builds both Brian's character of being a good man and saving Dom, but also Dom's appreciation of Brian not leaving him behind build's up Dom. Family doesn't leave each other behind, and they watch each other's back. The film tries to make us think Brian's desire to help Dom is Mia-based, but I think he just really wants to be apart of that family, and Ted Levine even says he has to make a choice about which family he wants to be apart of. He kind of chooses the police in this film, but his actions here come back where he finally makes his choice in Fast and Furious.Overall, if you can get past the horrible direction and how dated the film is now, there's actually a lot to like here from the above and beyond character work, to the heist gone wrong. I never cared for this film when it came out, but looking back it has the early shine of the elements I love of this series. It's flawed, but I still like it. RIP the great Paul walker",7,3,5,28 March 2015
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Tremendous fun, and a great expansion of the world of Middle-earth
","I have read absolutely everything that JRR Tolkien has ever written, and consider myself a Tolkien fanatic. This is my perspective on The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug. Please stick with me to the end, and I'll try not to lose you. Let's begin. So...if The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was Peter Jackson giving the purists their dues with a relatively straightforward and book-faithful film, then THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG is Peter Jackson saying: 'You've had your fun. Now stand back and watch what I can do.'And the ride he takes us on is absolutely exhilarating. SMAUG is darker, moodier, and more mature than any Middle Earth film we've seen thus far. Evil hangs over our heroes like a black pall (literally). Beset on all sides by revenge-seeking orcs, wargs, terrifying spiders, pale creepy- crawlies, double-crossing elves, treacherous humans, a growing Evil in a ruined Elvish citadel, and a huge, vain, fire-breathing dragon...both the heroes and the audience are plunged into a terrifyingly new world. And there's a lot of new stuff to feast your eyes on along the way.Castwise, Tauriel is a welcome female addition to the gang, played with charisma and spunk by Evangeline Lilly. Lee Pace's regal and scheming elf- king Thranduil is absolutely astounding, delivering a tour-de-force in a few minutes of screen time. Luke Evans could not be better as Bard, simultaneously grim and noble. But of course, the real draw here is Benedict Cumberbatch, wearing two very villainous hats. The first is as the Necromancer, who, in addition to manifesting himself as an inkblot, is really quite scary. And the second...is the reason that you came here in the first place: Smaug. The Terrible. Smaug just so happens to be the greatest dragon ever! He is everything I wanted him to be and more: vain, seductive, manipulative, terrifying, and of course, absolutely huge. I'd just like to congratulate Cumberbatch and the conceptual crew on his tremendous design.Our returning cast is also fantastic. Richard Armitage's Thorin Oakenshield is electrifying, with gravitas and stage presence enough for a character twice his stature. His grave eyes and deep voice tell of a lifetime of war and sorrow, and every line he speaks could be delivered by a king. Martin Freeman continues to be perfect as Bilbo, and Ian McKellen's Gandalf is just as crusty and warm as you remember him. Oh, and Legolas? Legolas is awesome. Like, web-swinging, spider-slaying, arrow- shooting, orc-killing awesome!Speaking of orc-killing, The Desolation of Smaug has, in THIS Tolkienian's perspective, the best action scene of the year: the barrels. The breathless, crazy, confusing, insane three-way-battle sequence (don't tease me for it) had me LITERALLY crying with sheer unadulterated glee! The rest of the action, including a hard-hitting spider attack, and a sprawling, rather one-sided battle between 10 dwarfs, a hobbit, and a dragon shows that Jackson has absolutely outdone himself!Well, now for the cons. If Desolation of Smaug has a con, it's that it really, really wants to keep moving to newer, darker territories, so whenever it slows down it feels, well...like an intermission between set- pieces. And the ending will divide the audience: you'll either love the breathless cliffhanger, or hate that you have to wait another year to find out what happens! And as a Tolkien purist, I have to address the fact of accuracy. SMAUG really isn't that accurate to the books. But you know what - I actually like that! I enjoy having absolutely NO IDEA what Peter Jackson has cooked up next. God knows what he's got cooked up for Part Three!So in conclusion, The Desolation of Smaug is a terrific ride. Filled with amazing action, excellent performances, and the requisite gorgeous New Zealand landscape shots and Howard Shore score, SMAUG is everything I hoped for and more",10,1,3,11 December 2014
Batman Begins," Best origins film ever
","Since his first dramatic appearance in Detective Comics in 1939, Batman has grown to become a pop-culture icon. From movie serials in the 40's, to a classic campy TV show in the 60's, to a solid animated series in the 90's, fans have thrilled to the super heroics of this unique character. However, as a film franchise, he has brought results that were somewhat less than impressive creatively. While the Tim Burton directed films, BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS were stylish and dark, they also suffered from plot holes you could drive a Batmobile through. Then Joel Schumacher introduced a Day-Glo sensibility to the Dark Knight in BATMAN FOREVER, before drowning the character in ludicrous costumes (a Bat suit with nipples???), pun-filled foes, and whiney sidekicks in the lousy BATMAN & ROBIN. By then, Batman as cinematic property had become a laughingstock. Fortunately, indie film director Christopher Nolan reinvigorates the franchise in glorious form in BATMAN BEGINS, a reboot of the Batman legend that, for the first time, puts the focus squarely on our hero and not on the over-the-top villains of past films. Nolan also bases the film in a strong semblance of reality that allows the audience to not only accept the possibility of the winged vigilante, but embrace it as well.Most fans already know the story of how wealthy Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) loses his parents when they are slain during an attempted robbery, but the movie also tells how he chose the bat as his symbol, as well as the steps needed to become the avenger of the night that he turns into. Disillusioned and frustrated by Gotham City's corrupt judicial system, the young Wayne goes abroad to study the criminal mind. Later, while locked in an Asian prison, Wayne is recruited by the enigmatic Ducard (Liam Neeson), who offers him a path in which to focus his anger and hone his skills. Wayne eventually joins his new mentor as a recruit in the mysterious League of Shadows, headed by the sinister Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Wantanabe). Eventually, Wayne realizes that he cannot follow the League's extreme methods of dispensing justice and returns to Gotham to forge his own way. It soon turns out that Wayne's return is just in time as Gotham falls prey to a fear epidemic engineered by the twisted Dr. Jonathan Crane AKA 'the Scarecrow' (Cillian Murphy) and a familiar figure from Wayne's past.From the top on down, this film is blessed with a solid cast that adds wonderfully to Nolan's vision. As the title hero, Christian Bale blows all other Batman portrayers out of the water with his intense and scary take of the role. This is a Batman that you not only fear, but can relate to as well. In fact, he turns in the definitive performance. Michael Caine adds warmth and humor as Wayne's trusty butler, Alfred. Liam Neeson does a great variation of his usual mentor roles as Ducard, a man with his own surprising secret. As an assistant DA and Wayne's childhood friend, Katie Holmes does a nice job with what is basically a thankless role. Cillian Murphy makes for a perfectly creepy Scarecrow, while Morgan Freeman is solid as usual as the man who provides Batman's wondrous car and gadgets. Gary Oldman is wonderfully cast against type as Jim Gordon, one of Gotham's few honest cops. The scene in which he drives the tank-like Batmobile is a sheer delight.The screenplay by Nolan and David Goyer (who wrote the BLADE films) is awash with characterization and motivation...something that you don't see in many comic book films as a rule. In fact, you get so engrossed by the proceedings that you almost forget that you are watching a 'superhero' film in the first place. The special effects are used to enhance the story and not overpower it, while the set design pictures a Gotham that is a unique cross of Chicago, New York and Hong Kong. If there is a flaw, it lies in some of the fight sequences. Done in close-ups and quick cuts, they can get frustrating for those who want to see more of Batman's fighting style. However, this is very minor since the story never ceases to grasp your attention.In the end, Nolan and his superb cast and crew succeed in achieving what was once thought impossible: the resurrection of a film franchise that, if not dead, was at least on life support. As a result, Batman is once again flying high and BATMAN BEGINS is a film that I wholeheartedly recommend.",10,1,2,29 July 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," a brilliant start to the trilogy
","Peter Jackson's The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is not a direct adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's beloved children's story The Hobbit. And if that's what you want, you will be disappointed. This is a prequel to the movie trilogy The Lord of the Rings. Something that became apparent within the first 15 minutes of the movie. It's clearly framed as that. If you didn't like those movies... you won't like this one.It is not a stand alone story. If you want something that is complete in and of itself... you won't like this movie. On the other hand. If you enjoyed The Lord of the Rings movies and you like spending time in that vision of Middle-earth there's no reason why you wouldn't enjoy the prequel. Visually this is clearly the same place and while the tone is lighter you can see how it would progress to the darkness of LOTR.A lot has been made of the fact that a small children's book has been turned into three movies. To be honest I always thought it would need two in order to be done thoroughly. Because the Hobbit at some 320 pages (depending on the version you have) is not actually that short. Most movies if directly transcribed would really only make up a short story.One of the pleasures of An Unexpected Journey was that everything was there. It was frustrating to me in the Lord of the Rings movies that so much had to be either skipped or rushed (and I'm not even talking about Tom Bombadil who I don't particularly care for). That isn't a problem here in fact the humour and lightness of The Hobbit is actually present in the film, particularly in the earlier scenes. Complete with songs. And yes we get Dwalin, Balin, Dori, Ori, Nori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur and Bombur, Fili and Kili and of course Thorin Oakenshield all introduced in suitable and largely comic fashion.And it's a huge credit that despite the huge number of dwarfs, many of who are not terribly distinctive even in the original text and who in some cases only get a few lines of their own, each of them does seem quite distinctive but what Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philipa Boyens have done is to blend those lighter elements into the grimmer back story. We get to see what was going on while Gandalf was not with the dwarfs. And this isn't just made up. It is based solidly on the material in the appendices from The Lord of the Rings. I should know, I read them often enough.Perhaps that is why I enjoyed the movie as much as I did. I love that material and I loved the time it got here. I loved that they were able to finally slot Radagast in after he was removed from the original trilogy speaking of Radagast the Brown, he had some of my favourite moments in the movie despite that being perhaps the biggest stretch from any actual Tolkien text. Yeah maybe they over-egged the drug user references with both the pipe-weed sequence and the mushrooms comment, but Sylvester McCoy honestly did some of his finest work in this movie.The introduction of the additional material actually helps the narrative considerably. In truth The Hobbit is a story about a bunch of random events that are tied together with references to luck and fate. By emphasising the back story we get an enemy and something driving the plot forward.There are some liberties taken with characterisation. Probably less than in The Lord of the Rings but the dwarfs in general and Thorin in particular are less incompetent than they were in the book.The same is true of Bilbo here who by the end of the movie actually stands up for himself.In terms of acting, Ian McKellan is of course always brilliant. And of the dwarfs Kenn Stott as Balin in particular just nails his role. In fact if I had seen this first I would have been much more affected by the tomb scene in Fellowship of the Ring because you can feel a connection between Balin and Bilbo and you can see why he's respected. James Nesbit as Bofur, Aidan Turner as Kili, Dean o Gorman as Fili and Richard Armitage as Thorin all excel in their roles as well. And of course there is Andy Serkis returning to the role of Gollum.Which brings me nicely to Bilbo Baggins himself. As portrayed by Martin Freeman. Freeman gets to use his comedic chops throughout the movie, but also has to dig a bit deeper for some scenes. And while some of his mannerism, the same ones we saw in The Office and Sherlock are there, within the first 40 minutes I was watching Bilbo Baggins not Martin. This is a long movie. The running time is 169 minutes. So almost 3 hours. I can see that in the cinema I might have found that too much. But sitting in the comfort of home with the ability to stop whenever I wanted to get a drink or use the bathroom, I had no trouble with the length at all. The movie kept me interested the whole time.I loved the movie. Enjoyed all of it. Purists will hate it. People who just wanted The Hobbit will hate it. Some people may well find it too long and just not be as interested in the Middle-earth background as I am.",10,2,5,10 December 2014
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," mommy's very angry
","The Lost World: Jurassic Park is directed by Steven Spielberg and adapted to screenplay by David Koepp from the novel written by Michael Crichton. It stars Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Pete Postlethwaite, Vince Vaughn, Richard Schiff, Peter Stormare, Vanessa Lee Chester, Arliss Howard and Harvey Jason. Music is scored by John Williams and cinematography by Janusz Kamiński.Four years on from the horrors of Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar, it transpires that there is a second dinosaur site on Isla Sornar. Dr. Ian Malcolm (Goldblum) is forced to head off to face the horrors once again when he learns that his paleontologist girlfriend, Sara Harding (Moore), is already on the island as a forerunner to a team John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) is assembling to document the dinosaurs in their habitat. Once their, though, the problems soon arise, especially when a team from InGen arrive with other ideas about the dinosaurs on their minds...Given the massive success of Jurassic Park in 1993, a sequel was inevitable. What transpires is pretty much more of the same, it's very safe film making by Spielberg. Coming off of the emotional exertions of his last film, Schindler's List, few can deny that the director was entitled to wind down with The Lost World project, there was after all nothing safe about Schindler's, but although Jurassic 2 is a hugely enjoyable family blockbuster, a jazzy bit of hi-tech fun, it lacks the requisite brains to make it an inspiring sequel.Formula follows the same path, humans in peril on the island, with some added and new dinosaurs (double T-Rex a bonus), and then the 'twist' in the narrative sees some monster peril come to San Diego, King Kong style, for the finale. There's inter fighting between the good dudes led by Malcolm and the bad guys led by the weasely Peter Ludlow (Howard) who is Hammond's conniving nephew and current head of InGen. Family issues also feature, of course since this is Spielberg after all, while the dangers of tampering with science message remains as strong as ever.Cast are ably led by a witty Goldblum, who is a reassuring presence carried over from the first film, and the tech-credits are as expected, very high. Some scenes soar, such as a sequence shot from under a pane of glass that starts to crack under the weight of a character, others not so, such as having Malcolm's teenage daughter turn into Nadia Comăneci for one credulity stretching scene. But all told it's an honest blockbuster purely aimed at the target audience who helped to see it make over $600 million in profit. Safe often pays you see, and as sequels go it's one of the better ones in the 90s. It's exciting if intellectually stunted.",7,6,8,7 June 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," A fantastic action film with brains
","What a very very good film this is. In 'Rise of The Planet of the Apes', English director Rupert Wyatt has a stab at doing what Tim Burton failed spectacularly to do in 2001 - resurrecting the Planet of the Apes franchise. What Wyatt has created, against all the odds, is a thoughtful, intelligent and stirring piece which provides the perfect antidote to all the silly, lacklustre 'Apes' films since Franklin J. Schaffer's classic original from 1968.The film charts the rise of Caesar, an orphaned laboratory chimp, from timid youngster to a sort of revolutionary leader of his fellow Simians. Will Rodman (James Franco) is a scientist at a pharmaceutical company researching a new drug and potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease that reverses the damage to brain tissue, tested on chimps. The effect it has on these animals is to rapidly increase intelligence to an unprecedented degree. After one of the apes goes berserk and trashes the laboratory, the drug is rejected by investors and all but one of the chimps, the baby Caesar, are killed. Will takes the chimp home with him and raises it himself but continues to use the drug on his father (John Lithgow), an Alzheimer's sufferer. Needless to say things go awry, and Caesar is taken away to a special facility where a large number of primates are held in captivity. Along the way there are various maltreatments of Caesar and his fellow chimps at the hands of sadistic humans, all of which contributes to his rise to power. Here begins the most powerful section of the movie, as Caesar gains the trust of his fellow apes and then eventually begins to command them.Absolutely central to the success of the movie is the performance of Andy Serkis as Caesar, again displaying his enormous physical talents and reaffirming why he is the 'go to' man for motion capture. Whether he be Gollum, King Kong, Captain Haddock or Caesar, someone please change the Academy rules and nominate this brilliant actor for an Oscar. The CGI effects are, for the most part, remarkable and as good as I have seen to date, with just a few slips; moments where you are reminded that the chimps aren't actually there. The final clash between apes and humans on the Golden Gate Bridge is thrilling and spectacular.Sadly the performances of the human contingent are less spectacular. This is perhaps partly due to the fact that they have increasingly little to do as the film progresses, becoming almost fringe characters. Indeed, James Franco is OK as will and the relationship between him and Caesar is done extremely well. Freida Pinto has little to do from the start besides look pretty and smile sympathetically. But this is a fairly minor gripe because this is very much Caesar's story. In fact it makes the movie all the more impressive because Caesar's rise is depicted for a large portion of the film with very little dialogue. The pick of the human performances is probably John Lithgow as Will's father, a man losing his identity.A really pleasant surprise this one. On the one hand a great action movie, with some thrilling set-pieces and terrific special effects. But its real power lies in the performance of Serkis as the central character, and the fun to be had watching him lead a Spartacus style revolution against oppression.",8,1,3,29 July 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," something worth fighting for
","Peter Jackson has done what could not be done. Deemed unfilmable for decades (with the terrible cartoons as an example of why), 'The Lord of the Rings' took the audiences by storm when 'Fellowship of the Ring' premiered in 2001. In 2002, anticipation was even higher, dread was lower -- and 'Two Towers' is an outstanding continuation of the epic fantasy tale. The movie picks up where 'Fellowship' left off: Merry and Pippin have been captured by Uruk-hai, and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are pursuing them. But they are sidetracked by an old friend: Gandalf, returned in a new form and with new powers, as Gandalf the White. He takes them to the kingdom of Rohan, whose king is bewitched by the evil Saruman. They barricade the people of Rohan in the fortress of Helm's Deep, for a final defiant stand against an army of Uruk-hai. Sam and Frodo have left, to venture into Mordor alone so that Frodo can destroy the Ring in Mordor's Mount Doom. When the two hobbits become lost in Emyn Muil, Frodo realizes that someone is following them: Gollum, the tormented, twisted former owner of the Ring. They capture Gollum, who swears to serve 'the master of the Precious.' But even Gollum's shaky allegiance isn't enough for them to succeed, because the Ring has started to bend Frodo to its will. While the first movie revolved around Frodo, the Ring and the Fellowship, here the focus widens. We get a better sense of the epic quality of the story and how it affects the whole world, not just our heroes. Gondor is crumbling, Rohan is beaten down by orcs, and even the forces of nature -- the tree-like ents -- are being attacked by Sauron and Saruman. It's nature versus the destructive machines, and the wild wrecking of Saruman's forges by these ancient tree shepherds is something to cheer for. Elijah Wood blossoms in this film as Frodo Baggins, the little hobbit who could. In the first movie Wood played Frodo as an innocent who loses his innocence; here he takes it a step further, showing the darkness and violence that are swallowing Frodo up. Because we saw what a bright, sweet person Frodo was before, it's all the more horrible to see him starting to slide down (even attacking his best friend -- the look on Frodo's face as he comes to his senses is stunning). Sean Astin perfectly embodies Sam Gamgee -- increasingly desperate, trying to keep Frodo from going under. He serves as a reminder of what Frodo is fighting for, and Astin has perhaps the most powerful lines of the film, near the end: 'But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer.' These simply-worded lines will bring tears to your eyes. But if Frodo is just starting to be addicted, Gollum is a junkie. Even if Andy Serkis doesn't appear in one frame in the entire movie, his motions and voice are heard and seen behind an exquisitely detailed CGI puppet. This is no Jar Jar or Dobby -- Gollum is detailed down to the last hair and wrinkle, believable in his appearance (I actually forgot he was animated for most of the movie), and has a multifaceted personality that reflects his own inner struggle -- Smeagol and Gollum, good and evil. The scene where Gollum's two halves argue is too amazing for words. The other supporting actors shine almost as brightly. Viggo Mortensen turns his reluctant hero Aragorn into a leader and a warrior. Ian McKellen manages to make Gandalf more stately and majestic, yet keeps that little grandfatherly twinkle. John Rhys-Davies provides a bit of comedy as Gimli, mostly related to Gimli's stature, but never loses his dignity; Orlando Bloom is outstanding as ethereal elf archer Legolas once again. Liv Tyler captures Arwen's fear of mortality and loneliness. Billy Boyd's Pippin and Dominic Monaghan's Merry, the well-meaning goofballs of 'Fellowship,' are now forced to make their own decisions. And new cast members Miranda Otto and Bernard Hill also shine as the strong-willed Eowyn and tough old king Theoden, in roles that will bloom further in the third film. Peter Jackson (who makes a few cameos) once again outdoes himself with camera-work and direction. His cameras as like living things: they swoop, dive, pull back for outstanding combat shots and then zoom in for exquisite close-ups. The battle scenes are dark, bloody, explosive, and full of chaos; only near the finale does any hint of glory shine through. He adds little human touches (the family split up by the war) that give a glimpse of what the non-heroic, ordinary people are suffering. Of course 'Two Towers' isn't as good as the book. Few movies are. But taken purely as a cinematic experience, and an adaptation, 'Two Towers' is virtually without peer. Epic, majestic, action-packed and brimming with pathos, this is a treasure.",10,2,4,27 December 2014
Transformers," Don't take it seriously it's just fun!!!
","I wasn't going to watch this film because it sounded like such a cheesy cash-in of all the other comic book and 80s cartoon revival films going around. Which technically it was. I'd heard it was a no-brainer with great special effects. Luckily I love enormous CGI, and someone else had bought it so I watched it for the hell of it. And loved it!I wasn't disappointed by the visual effects - they are tremendous! So good, in fact, that the detail sometimes makes the fight scenes confusing - more so than watching LOTR The Two Towers from the front row of the cinema! But why I enjoyed it so much wasn't down to the graphics, but the dialogue - shocking but true. It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen which in no way professed to be a comedy! For starters, one of the Transformers is a bright yellow Chevrolet sent to protect our young Shia LaBeouf - though apparently not from getting laid! I hadn't realised the Transformers came to Earth in order to become match-makers. Anyone ever tell them three's a crowd?OK, I was initially right and this is a completely formulaic story wrapped around a load of mouldy cheese; an old plot rehashed and straining for some kind of deep and meaningful backstory - at least in any scenes involving the Autobots and Decepticons (see how I was paying attention?). As long as the robots don't talk, you've got a great movie. Really. The dialogue was cringe-inducing, but only from the Transformers themselves. The human characters were fine. Better than fine. Bloody well funny, I say!Also a little note about how styles of acting change over the years: Look back at a film from the 1930s and you'd be forgiven for thinking it a little OTT. (But they all came from the theatre, so we can forgive them.) More recently - and as this film seems to show - we're getting into the truly 'natural' side of acting, where people DO talk over the top of each other when arguing, or joking, or simply behaving as normal people do. In reality people don't wait for one person to stop talking before saying something - that is truly reading lines from a set script. But I think actors are now trying to sound genuine on screen.However, It doesn't always work, sometimes it's confusing and distorted unless you have an ear for it. I'm putting this in as a warning, because I watched this with my mum and dad and got different reactions. Dad was fine - thought it was hysterical and loved the explosions. Boom boom. But my mother struggled with everything, and in the end believed she must be entirely out of touch with the world because they seemed to be speaking a different language to her. I suggested she was just old and going deaf as well as not being down with the kids. She told me to get stuffed. But anyway, just a warning in case you have that era problem where you can't discern one voice from a crowd: the party-effect, or whatever.But for anyone else - as long as you don't take the film seriously, you'll enjoy it emmensely. Forget the awful moral message delivered by the robots and just giggle your socks off!",8,1,2,15 August 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," An exceptional film that could've been a cluster
","The Marvel Cinematic Universe's focus on Captain America, Iron Man, and Thor has become routine or even a tad rote, but here comes a potent blast of fresh air in the form of the Guardians of the Galaxy. A type of pop space opera, the film pairs a Earth-born outlaw with four dysfunctional alien compatriots, including a machine-gun-wielding raccoon and a scene-stealing living tree (an adorable monster and my personal favourite). Together, they combat outer-space evil. It may build to an unsurprising—though still involving—sequence of race-to-save-the-world combat and pursuit, but there are so many exciting, hilarious, and/or riveting details and detours along the way. In fighting shape for the role which will forever change his promising career, Chris Pratt shines, exuding intense man-of-action confidence while also dispensing wry one-liners with an expert's ease. As one of the other guardians, a musclebound alien dead-set on avenging his slain family, martial artist and wrestler Dave Bautista is a pleasant surprise. His imposing physique is complemented by unexpectedly spot-on deadpan comic timing. The protagonists in general are wonderful; the tensions and bonds within the fresh-faced cosmic superhero team are not only introduced, but also deeply felt. Their worlds, too, are intriguing, overflowing with vivid colours and numerous retro art-direction flourishes.Spry and humorous, the film is simply a very pleasant way to spend two hours. Its enormous charms compensate for a few not-insignificant flaws, including a couple squandered side players, including Glenn Close and, sadly, Benicio Del Toro, whose absurd, yet quietly menacing intergalactic 'Collector' I hope to see again in future films. The antagonist, Lee Pace's genocidal Ronan the Accuser, is also unmemorable, particularly compared to the instant-classic heroes. Pace is a gifted actor, and he tries to bolster the role with a catalogue of growls and scowls, but the macabre-generic design of the character leaves much to be desired, and the motives behind his destruction are barely explored.",8,0,2,21 August 2014
Jurassic World," Spielberg's vision brought full circle
","As someone like many, who holds Steven Spielberg's 1993 masterpiece quite dearly to my heart, you can definitely say I walked into this new installment/hopeful franchise restarter with equal excitement and nervousness. There's always a need to be cautious when a series returns to the big screen for the first time in over 10 years, but at the same time I love dinosaurs so the fact that I'd get to see them again roaring on the big screen was the real excitement. So does this revisit to this franchise live up to the hype? For the most part, I think honestly yes.I'll get this out of the way: Jurassic World is flawed. Like flawed as hell, there's absolutely no denying that. There are numerous sub- plots that could've easily thrown out of the movie and leave more room for the awesome dinosaurs, character development is mostly thrown out the window, when the humor misses oh it really misses with some flat dialogue to say the least, and there are plenty of story and script issues I had throughout. But, the most important thing I can tell you is that, I had a blast and smile on my face throughout which is what I wanted from this movie more than anything really.With every script issue this movie suffers from, Collin Trevorrow makes up for it behind the camera. 'Jurassic World' is shot beautifully with some really impressive cinematography work from John Schwartzman, and while the CGI will not go down as groundbreaking for the blockbuster genre like the 1993 film, there are some remarkable effects here. But, mostly particularly to me this movie definitely manages to capture the tone, feel and spirit of a Jurassic Park film. Yes, it doesn't come anywhere close to capturing that sense of wonder or creativity that made the first film the special treat that it is, but Trevorrow does manage to capture some of the special essence I had when beholding that special classic, while also crafting some impressive world building. There's lots of callbacks made and nostalgia felt throughout, but Trevorrow never uses this as a pointless plot point to move the story along. Most importantly though, Trevorrow definitely proves himself to be capable of handling the action scale. The dinosaur sequences are of course the primary reason why you'd go to one of these movies, and the film delivers them in exhilarating, exciting, and pulse pounding ways. There's enough solid tension throughout, and the finale 20 minutes might honestly be my favorite climax of the year. Some seriously awesome stuff that I will not give away (who actually hasn't seen this movie yet? I felt like I was the last one to).Alright, let's talk about this pretty big cast. They're all pretty solid, especially given the weak character work they're given. Chris Pratt has been a rising star as of late, and for good reasons, because he proves here he wasn't a one trick pony with Guardians. He brings such a likability, charisma, and coolness to the character of Owen Grady that makes him such an engaging lead to watch. There's not really much depth given to this character, but Pratt knows how to be charming and bad-ass so he helps makes us become attach to him as a lead. Now, I've seen some complain about Jessica Chastain.... err I mean Bryce Dallas Howard here and I don't know why. Her character did annoy me a little at first with her uptight bitch persona (which we all know Bryce has proved to play those type of women so well), and again not much depth here, but she plays the character as well as anyone could (who else would run in those high heels like that?), and I did grow an attachment to her as a character. Maybe, it's because I thought she looked so stunning in this movie, but eh whatever. Her and Pratt, I thought made a believable team, but the romance angle could've been completely thrown out. Jake Johnson is actually quite amusing as the cliché tech guy, I really enjoyed his character, I just really wish there was a lot more of him. It was nice to see BD Wong again, and though their characters occasionally got on my nerves, with the whole emo teenager, I had no issues with Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson performances themselves. To my surprise and sadness, one of weak link of the cast was Vincent D'Oonofrio as the main human antagonist. This is really no problem with D'Onofrio, he plays the role as well as anyone could, he knows how to play an asshole well, but this was not just a well written villain at all. Right when he appears on screen, you know exactly where this character is going, and his whole motivations of wanting to weaponize these dinosaurs for military purpose made literally no sense. It's a shame, with such a underrated talent like D'Onofrio coming off such a incredible villain performance in Daredevil, they really could've made this a not so clear cut antagonist with reasonable motivations, but no his character is simply a pointless prick to just be a prick.All, in all, I'd be a fool if I told you 'Jurassic World' was perfect masterpiece to behold. It's definitely not, there's tons of issues I can write about that I've already have, but I'd also be a fool if I told you I didn't find myself having a pretty damn great time throughout its brisk running time. For everything it does wrong, it does something else so right. It's big, loud, dumb, but still insanely fun summer blockbuster that Trevorrow manages to treat with plenty of charm and heart that definitely kind of help make me feel like a kid again.",9,34,98,22 June 2015
The Dark Knight," Perhaps the pinnacle of superhero movies
","Christopher Nolan has a vision. And whether you agree with it or not, he undeniably completes it in 'The Dark Knight'--a vicious, engrossing, overwhelming, intelligent event- film that re-defines 'comic-book-flicks'. In Nolan's grim, dark-depiction of Gotham-City (the crime-ridden hell protected by legendary superhero Batman), the director strives to make everything real (something he began in the well-received 'Batman Begins'). He makes it plausible, possible. And yet there's more to it: just as 'Begins' was a dissection of myth, the nature of symbols and heroes, 'Knight' is the escalation of that notion. It's a biblical- confrontation of 'good-and-evil', yet as 'good-and-evil' really exist: a conflict of ideals, something that can't be purely-defined but that is relative to a viewpoint. In Nolan's world, the line of villainy and heroism isn't crossed... it's non-existent. The bad-guys don't see themselves as bad-guys, and as such something so unnervingly-real comes across it might fly past some people's minds (no insult to anybody, it's just common that people don't look deep into 'popcorn-flicks'): the battle is a complete ambiguity.The film runs at nearly 2.5-hours, yet never ceases to lose interest or momentum. It doesn't waste a scene or moment; every event is utilized and necessary. 'The Dark Knight' tells a story worth telling and it takes the proper amount of time to tell it. Action-sequences are frantic, old-school, eye-grabbing stunts (vastly superior to 'Begins') and in their chaotic intensity we see that they serve purpose to the story, yet more interesting are not played for pure entertainment-value: we are meant to watch, petrified, simply hoping that the outcome will go the hero's way. Attention is never lost because we are immersed in a breathtaking, almost completely-unpredictable story (it packs many a shock), that makes us think and more importantly gains our emotional-investment. We come to care for the characters, because they are believable, developed, and personified fully.Everyone has great-chemistry together. Maggie Gyllenhal is a more mature Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes. Morgan Freeman provides his authoritative presence to the role of bad- gadget-inventor/Wayne-Enterprise CEO Lucius Fox, and under anyone else's portrayal, the part would be less-memorable. Gary Oldman underplays his world-wearied lawman with such honest-nobility, you never feel for a second any of its forced-acting. The irreplaceable Michael Caine makes a gentle, reassuring, father-like presence as Alfred, and the movie would surely fail without his strong-presence and interjected-moments of light-humor.And while everyone (rightfully) pours the praise unto Bale and Ledger, I think most are glancing-over Knight's breakout-performance. As Harvey Dent, Aaron Eckhart does more than hold himself in the company of such a renowned-cast. He makes his presence known, whether he's playing on the easy-going charisma of Gotham's 'White-Knight' or the broken and damaged, twisted-soul of Two-Face. He achieves a full-impact with the tragedy that comes unto his character, and so closely connects with Dent, that he makes his pain tangible for us: we sympathize even as we become terrified. He captures both facets of each personality flawlessly.Now, some people cite that 'Knight' has a potential fatal-flaw in the supposedly wooden- acting of Christian Bale. Admittedly, his development is not as grand as in 'Begins' (yet that film gave us such a good psychoanalysis of Wayne, we hardly need more), yet what Bale pulls off is admirable. Wayne is not an eccentric personality. He is a disillusioned man who can hardly find any joy in having no family, giving up his love-interest and spending his life fighting a battle that may never end. He's dark and conflicted, and Bale plays up on that brooding-mood by making Wayne look as though a thousand dark-things were on his mind. He's not wooden...he's a humorless, quiet individual. Even when Wayne is acting as a frivolous playboy for the public, every now and then Bale offers us a powerful glance that reminds us its all a façade; that deep down, something more disturbed irks him. Occasionally he offers a broken-smile when exchanging banter with Alfred, letting us know that beyond the dour depression of the Caped-Crusader lies a damaged human-being. It is only in the guise of a growling masked-man, that he can unleash his true, ferocious personality.Finally, who could forget Heath Ledger. Now, when he was first-announced for the part, I was (along with many other people) asking myself: 'Why?'. Mr. Ledger had proved with 'Brokeback Mountain' he could deliver a potent performance. But he hadn't before. It is only, after seeing this film, that I know the answer to 'why?': I see the significance of his loss.When Heath appears in this movie, he is completely unrecognizable. His voice is distinctly-altered; a near-whiny, pedophile-like tone that sends shivers down the spine. His face is completely splattered with makeup that renders him both freakishly-nightmarish and strangely-funny. And when you see him, you don't think it's him. In this, his final performance, Ledger proved he was a chameleon. His two iconic performances in this, and 'Brokeback', could not be more different. I am convinced he could have been anything in his career. He commits so intensely to character that the line of actor/portrayal dies. His every tick and gesture only further-enhances his character. Heath never hams the role up or goes for something cheap: he delivers a fully-immersed display of psychotic madness...or do we just label him that to feel safer? The movie writes the character brilliantly; blending terrifying truth into his every social-accusation, and making us question why we laugh at his sick-jokes.'The Dark Knight' has had an incredible-amount of hype running for it, from the get-go, mounting ever-higher, until Heath Ledger's too-soon death. And the finished-product does more than exceed all of the near-impossible expectations placed on it. It becomes something much richer than a super-hero-franchise-saga. Christopher Nolan has opened a new door in cinema: allowing action-flicks to become more serious, capable of intelligence. He has transformed this into a piece of artwork, full of beauty, terror, moral- conundrums. This movie has changed things...forever.",10,1,3,29 July 2014
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," A great adaptation but I expected more
","I think that when you take the longest Harry Potter book and turn it into the shortest Harry Potter film, that a large number of complaints by fans as to what has been cut will be inevitable after they watch 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.' Not that this means that the legions of fans will be bitterly disappointed by the film version, but rather that there will be regrets over not getting to see favourite scenes on the screen. For example, Quidditch is completely out of the film, denying Ron of his best moments in the sun (start singing 'Weasley is our king'). So do not be surprised when your mind keeps shifting to what has been cut and distracting you from time to time while watching this summer's latest blockbuster.When last we left our hero, Harry fell victim to a trap to bring back Lord Voldermort, which cost Cedric Diggory his life. The Ministry of Magic wants things hushed up, but Dumbledore tells the students at Hogwarts that Diggory was murdered and Lord Voldermort murdered him. As this fifth film opens Harry and his wicked cousin Dudley are attacked by Dementors. Harry uses his wand to defend them and is summarily expelled from Hogwarts for using magic in front of a muggle. The good news is that Harry gets reinstated, but the bad news is that the Ministry of Magic uses the opportunity to appoint Dolores Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary at the Ministry, as the school's new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. However, Umbridge teaches only the theory and not the practise because she insists Harry is a liar and there is nothing the students need to learn to defend themselves from. Then things get progressively worse.'The Order of the Phoenix' was the most maddening book to read, not because it was the longest, but because I detest Dolores Umbridge. As far as I am concerned she makes Voldermort look good, because he knows he is evil, wicked, bad, mean and nasty inside, while Umbridge thinks the ends justify the means. She is puritanical, sadistic and hypocritical. If there were not going to be children reading this review I would tell you what I really think of her. Suffice it to say, she makes me sick and I do not even take pleasure in loving to hate her, which is why my only requirement going into the film is that the Weasley Twins get their moment of glory when they become the disloyal opposition to the new order at Hogwarts.Daniel Radcliffe continues to have the tote the heavy load in these films as Harry, with Rupert Grint's Ron Weasley being reduced more and more often to reaction shots while Emma Watson's Hermione Granger remains the Mistress of Exposition in these films. Alan Rickman as Snape remains pitch perfect casting and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black is also a joy to watch, but I discovered in this film that I really like Michael Gambon's performance as Dumbledore, mainly because he always plays up the character's intelligence and I find I prefer his interpretation to that of the late Richard Harris, forgive my heresy. Imelda Staunton does not look as much like a toad as Umbridge does in the book, but she captures the character's detestability from start to finish. We are always painfully aware how dangerous she is, whether she smiles or not. Also, Evanna Lynch steals more scenes as Luna Lovegood than Katie Leung does as Cho Chang, and it is certainly interesting to see Neville (Matthew Lewis) towering over everybody, with Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) in the silent but strong role for the pivotal sextet.After seeing this film I raced home and got out my copy of the book and starting cataloguing things that had been cut. Such comparisons are, as I suggested up top, inevitable for anyone who has read the book. At this point what I missed the most were some of the conversations between Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagall and Umbridge where Minerva verbally flaws the Inquisitor. The omission that I am focusing on the most is the whole bit about why Neville's family was a target of Voldermort (I agree with Harry: always say his name and thereby reduce its power), since that suggests implications for what will happen in the final book, which gets released in just ten more days. I also would have liked to have seen an over reaction to Harry discovering his father bullied Snape at Hogwarts. My favourite part ends up being the impressive wizard's duel between Voldermort and Dumbledore. Screenwriter Michael Goldenberg does a good job of whittling down Rowling's book and director David Yates does a competent job, but fans will simply want more. Also, we know what happens in the next book and all of the bad things that happen in this film cannot help but seem inconsequential in comparison. Plus, fans will be distracted by mining this film for clues as to what will happen in the last book.",8,0,1,17 August 2014
The Last Samurai," Grand & Entertaining a mixture of history and fiction
","The honour and code of the samurai has always been enticing to a Western civilisation that is far removed from such customs, which perhaps makes The Last Samurai such an enticing, enigmatic film. Edward Zwick crafts quite an epic adventure rich in mythology & thematic resonance that while traditionally Hollywood in its construction still manages to exist a cut above many such movies of its ilk, a touch of class surrounding how the story of Captain Nathan Algren is put together, based as it is on several real life legendary American figures who played key roles in the Satsuma Rebellion in Japan during the late 19th century. This isn't a direct re-telling of those events but serves as a leaping off point to construct a tale about a stranger in a strange land, of a man haunted by fighting an unjust war who rediscovers his honour & place in the world through a dying culture. Zwick's film is slick, sweeping, beautifully shot and frequently involving, backed up by a strong performance by Tom Cruise in one of those roles that remind you just what a good actor he can be.In the role of Algren, Cruise begins a dejected man living out of a bottle, bereft of purpose & suffering post-Civil War nightmares of a man touted as a hero despite feeling the guilt of slaughtering Indians crushed under the might of a military machine; in that sense, The Last Samurai is very anti-war in its message, John Logan's story painting the Americans and specifically the Imperialist Japanese not in the greatest light. Cruise takes Algren on a traditional voyage of discovery, first pitted against the samurai code & eventually becoming consumed by it, consumed by the similarity of the way of the warrior between both cultures - and Ken Watanabe's dignified samurai 'rebel' Katsumoto learns from him, as well as the other way around, with Cruise remaining stoic & only getting flashes of a chance to display the usual Cruise charm, but that's OK - Algren isn't the kind of character to benefit from that, Cruise's natural magnetism is enough here. Wit is provided thankfully through, albeit briefly, Billy Connolly as a tough old Irish veteran & chiefly Timothy Spall as our portly 'narrator' of sorts, who serves to help mythologise Algren & the legend itself. Zwick is most concerned with that, you see, the idea of legends and how men become them, exploring that concept alongside digging into the cultural rituals and practises of a changing Japan.Logan's story is placed at a time when the old ways of Japan were shifting, under the pressures of global politics & business; the Emperor here is a naive young man, sitting on an empty throne, looking to Watanabe for validation as his advisor's push to quash a rebellion fighting to preserve the old ways, preserve Japanese interests as America knocks on the door. That's why Cruise's role here is so interesting, his character learning of the samurai code & helping those around him remember their history, and Zwick explores well the concept of national identity alongside personal ideas of myth, legend & destiny. It all boils together in a careful script, never overblown, which neatly develops the relationships involved & helps you fully believe Algren's transformation into the eponymous 'last samurai'. Along the way, Zwick doesn't forget theatrics - staging plenty of well staged & intense fight scenes which utilise the strong Japanese production design, before building to a quite epic war climax with army pitted against army, with personal stakes cutting through it, backed up indeed by another superlative score by Hans Zimmer. It becomes more than just a historical swords & armour film, reaching deeper on several levels.What could have been a slow paced, potentially ponderous movie is avoided well by Edward Zwick, who with The Last Samurai delivers one of the stronger historical adventure epics of recent years. Beautifully shot in many places, with some excellent cinematography & production standards, not to mention an impressive script well acted in particular by Tom Cruise & Ken Watanabe, Zwick creates a recognisably Hollywood picture but for once a movie that doesn't dumb down, doesn't pander and ultimately serves as an often involving, often damn well made story. Especially one to check out if you love the way of the samurai.",10,2,3,31 May 2015
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A faithful adaptation
","I will always think fondly of this movie because it inspired me to pick up the first Harry Potter book and I've been a rabid fan ever since. I'm one of those book before movie people so I had to read the novel in order to go see this movie and I was pleased to see that it was such a faithful adaptation to Rowling's wonderful tale.This movie did a wonderful job of capturing the wonder and awe of the first HP novel. Hogwarts was an especially lovely effect and when Harry first walks into the Great Hall and all the candles are floating overhead, I felt all the magic I felt when reading those words on the page. I think Columbus and crew captured the essence of the castle and somehow managed to create a visual of something so fantastical.The casting of the movie was also extremely well done. I adore Maggie Smith as McGonagall and Richard Harris captures the mischievous and wise nature of Dumbledore. Perhaps best of all the adult casting is that of Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. He looks exactly as I pictured the character but, more importantly, he captures Hagrid's rather childlike nature and the accent is wonderful. Coltrane doesn't just portray Hagrid, he is Hagrid.I also thought the children were wonderfully cast. Daniel Radcliffe looks like Harry and I fought back tears when his earnest young face first looked into the Mirror of Erised. Rupert Grint looks just as I pictured Ron Weasley and Emma Watson is wonderfully bossy and a fantastic know-it-all as Hermione Granger. The casting of the Phelps brothers as the Weasley twins was absolutely brilliant and I think they were dead on in their interpretation of the lovable scoundrels.Yet in spite of its fantastical nature, this film, like the book, feels as though it is something like our own reality. There are many wonderful things in Harry's world but it's not that different from our own. The same prejudices and the same human frailties that exist in our world exist in Harry's. Though being a wizard is pretty darn cool, it's not the answer to Harry's problems and the film makes clear that he has some difficult challenges ahead of him.I think the central theme of this movie is one that is invaluable for both children and adults alike: that love is the most powerful magic that exists. Even with all the wand waving and fantastical creatures, it is love that is Harry's salvation.",7,0,1,17 August 2014
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Harry is growing up
","The phenomenal success of J. K. Rowling's series of novels for children about a boy in a school of wizardry has been augmented by the enormous box office grosses of the film adaptations. Left with the daunting task of maintaining the standards and quality of the previous instalments, Director Mike Newell has fashioned in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, a marvellous, visual treat that matches the series' previous highs.A new year at Hogwarts brings old faces and some new ones as the school for witchcraft and wizardry is primed for great change and a growing threat. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is shaken by a recurring nightmare as the presence of Lord Voldemort looms ominously, and he summons Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) for advice. Soon a mysterious man, 'Mad Eye' Moody (Brendan Gleeson), arrives to help Harry against the dark forces. The school is preparing for a special gathering of two other schools to compete in a special Tri-Wizard Tournament, a fierce and dangerous competition in which only one older student from each respective school may enter via the Goblet of Fire. Harry becomes involved in the competition to the surprise of everyone including himself. As he and the other students find, the games are immensely formidable with dragons, underwater traps, and an endless maze of hedges. Meanwhile, Harry, Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) are experiencing the joys and pain of adolescence as the wonders of high school crushes and the anxiety of the school dance wreak havoc. Even Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) catches the romantic bug. Mistrust and accusations complicate matters for Harry, and Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) expresses his concerns about the future. Before long, Harry, Ron and Hermione bicker amongst themselves as their friendship is severely tested. When the tournament concludes, another set of tragic circumstances opens the way for new evil and betrayal. As the elder wizards (Gambon, Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman) close ranks to protect the students especially Harry, the future remains uncertain at best.Ironically, Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral) is the first British director of the series, and, while he had the difficult challenge of continuing the series, he has added some nice wrinkles and touches by delving deeper into the emotional conflicts of these students. In fact, the maturation and changes these teens must encounter richly add to the already exciting story. We root for these heroes and feel their discomfort and pain because we have in a sense grown up with them. As with any Harry Potter storyline, not all the characters are good and, conversely, not all the suspicious ones are bad. Several plot lines are carried over from the previous films and new ones are primed for future sequels. Screenwriter Steven Kloves, the keeper of the flame, has done a herculean job of distilling the essence of Rowling's novels into each film thus far.As always, the trio of young actors, Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint, own these roles, and the thought of replacing any of them due to age concerns was unnecessary. All three look great as they are now a little older and wiser. Of course, Gambon, Smith, Rickman, and Coltrane are the old pros who are the constants at Hogwarts. Ralph Fiennes is perfectly suited for his villainous turn in the startling climax. Brendan Gleeson does a fine job as the menacing, yet benevolent 'Mad Eye' Moody who supposedly watches over Harry during the tournament. It also seems that the most recent Harry Potter film is becoming quite an international event as the cast of students is even more ethnically diverse than ever before.As usual, the production values are outstanding with lavish sets and costumes imaginatively photographed by Roger Pratt. The special effects are quite impressive although nothing that you haven't already seen in the Lord of the Rings trilogy or the Star Wars sextet. Just the generous details and little touches throughout the film like the animated paintings add to the overall care that still goes into these films. Make no mistake, this is a lengthy film, but the pacing is good as a large number of scenes are strung back to back to contain as much of the book as possible into roughly two and a half hours. It feels a bit episodic but never loses sight of the main story and the emotional state of the characters.There are creepy images and a foreboding atmosphere through much of the film. This adaptation does contain more risqué scenes such as Harry's bathtub scene or the terrifying menace of Voldemort, in which the tone gets downright mean-spirited. The students are not so innocent anymore as they curse, and in one climactic scene come face to face with the pain of loss. A PG13 rating signals that the Potter adventures are growing up fast.It does require that the audience have a background in the series of books or films to fully appreciate the significance of critical events, although the film can stand on its own as pure entertainment and a coming of age. In some ways Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a classic bridge episode similar to The Empire Strikes Back. Not only is it a strong entry in the series with the most open ended finale yet, it proves a good setup for some potentially exciting things to come. Harry's next adventure couldn't have come soon enough!",8,0,1,17 August 2014
Thor," Pride comes before a fall
","After Marvel Studios had great success in bringing Iron Man, a character perceived to be only popular in the comics, to the big screen, they began working on other solo hero projects with the overall aim to produce The Avengers; the first time a movie would be made using multiple characters from individual movies to share one universeThor is another one of Marvel's lesser-known characters outside the comic-books, compared to the likes of Spider-Man and Wolverine. Based loosely on the Norse legends, which are referenced in the movie as being inspired by the fictional Asgardian race, which is a nice bit of confusing 'chicken and the egg' theorem. Thor lives in Asgard with his father, Odin and brother, Loki, and acts as protectors of the nine realms across more insidious races such as the Frost Giants, but when the fragile truce between the Asgardians and Frost Giants of Jotunheim is threatened by Thor's strong-minded techniques, the Asgardian prince is banished to Midgard, better known to me and you as Earth.I was unsure whether I would like the Norse mythology aspects to the story, but the film manages to make it seem convincing by portraying the Asgardians as otherworldly gods that inhabit another 'realm' as opposed to being spiritual. The mixture of magic and technology that is showcased in the frankly stunning CGI city of Asgard helps us identify with the characters and grounds them nicely into our world, explaining that the more primitive humans in the past had to explain their technology away as being Gods, which created our myths and legends.The action scenes were very entertaining, and there was a healthy sense of humour to the proceedings too, which made the film very enjoyable. The 'fish out of water' scenes with Thor on Earth were handled well, but it was the sequences on Asgard that were the most visually and dramatically stunning. While I understand that the film needed to be set on Earth to both help the audience identify with the storyline, and secondly set up the forthcoming Avengers film, I do wish there had been more sequences in the fantastical Asgardian worlds. Perhaps a sequel would explore this area more, since it is something seldom shown in comic-book movies, which are so determined to set things in 'our universe'.The cast is really strong, with great performances from Chris Hemsworth (Thor) who manages to start the film as brash and impatient, but evolves into a charming and thoughtful character. I also liked the calculating and sly Loki, played by Tom Middleston, who is so subtle in his performance that those watching the film unaware of the characters histories would not expect him to change allegiances throughout the movie. He also plays Loki much more complicated than I would have expected.As a relatively novice to Thor (but not to comics), I really enjoyed this and found that it didn't require any prior knowledge from the comics, as it explained all of the characters well, and their relationship with each other. The robotic villain known as The Destroyer was actually quite threatening, despite looking too similar to Iron Man (something that is poked fun at in the dialogue, when The Destroyer first appears) and the Ice Giants didn't look quite as visually interesting as they could have been, so for any sequels, I would appreciate more varied designs for the enemies drawing on the fantastical elements of Thor's mythology once more.",7,0,1,6 May 2016
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," The journey continues
","The first sequel to 'Harry Potter' is absolutely fantastic, far better than the original one. Or, I should say, despite some uneven pace and tone of the film, it is much more three- dimensional and complex, giving us what we want: theills of fantasy. Harry Potter is in the second year at Hogwarts, and now is ready to go back to the school, in spite of the advice given by strange creature called Dobby, who shows up before him to warn that very bad things would happen if Harry goes back. But Harry ignores his warnings anyway, and starts his new year at the school, only to find weird occasions that remind him of Dobby's words. And finally, he is to know that 'The Chamber of Secrets,' about which no one (including the teachers) knows -- its existence, its location, and its terrifying secrets -- is opened by someone inside of the place, and students start to fall victims to it. Can Harry stop the danger, and regain the peace for the school? The premise seems similar to that of the original film, but the overall tone of the film gets darker and more sinister. It is possible that some of the pre-teen kids might find the film too scary at some time (especially they don't like slugs, spiders and snakes), and perhaps adults find it the same way. Don't underestimate the film's dark elements any more. But the most remarkable thing about 'Chamber of Secrets' is its hugely improved CGIs, reflecting the filmmaker's confidence coming from the commercial success of the previous one. The match of Quiddich is again used as one of the highlights, and the newer game scene is simply great, much better than the first one. With enhanced sound effects, the fight between Harry and Malfoy looks more realistic, even frightening, flying all over the ground and stands (and unbelievably, under them). The only weak point is its new character Dobby, created all by CGIs, which still looks unnatural sometimes. Moreover, in the opening sequence, the film attempts to get laughs using Dobby not so effectively, making him a bit irritating creature like Jar-Jar Binks or Scooby-Doo. But wait a while, and see Ron's family is introduced, including ever delightful Julie Walters ('Billy Elliot') as Ron's mother. Another new character is given by Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart, a new teacher (and a celebrity) at Hogwarts. Obviously he is a comic relief, and Branagh is surprisingly good, this time not resorting to his overacting tendency that destroyed Woody Allen's 'Celebrity.' And don't miss the brief scene after the end credit roll. Daniel Radcliffe is as good as before, and so is Rupert Grint (in fact, they are giving the best acting in the film), but most regrettable is Emma Watson's Hermione, who is given much shorter time on the screen. All the actors are good, but their presence seems to be rather sacrificed to establish darker images of the school. So, John Cleese is allowed to speak very briefly only twice, and even Maggie Smith and Allen Rickman are not allotted enough time to impress us. You brink your eye, and you will miss Fiona Shaw! It is, however, undeniable that the film went through great improvement, and it explores much darker side of magic, which gives more thrills to adults and children alike. But how will they keep this pace in the future? Is it possible to combine evil elements with the concept of family picture? That is my only concern, and the second sequel would show the answer.",7,0,2,17 August 2014
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Bay_ware of nausea
","It was almost inevitable that a second Transformers movie would be made, given that a largely crude and sell able formula was used for the first. Eye candy makes up for about 95% of the target audiences expectations, after all.So it was a great pity that Michael Bay tried even harder to ensure that the maturer audience almost keeled over from motion sickness and extreme face-palming... Not only is 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' a tiresome sequel-by-numbers, but it has more flaws than a Wickes catalogue.The original movie was almost a guilty pleasure; pure popcorn entertainment that you can easily disengage your brain to enjoy (as with Armageddon). 'Revenge...', however, follows in Terminator 3's footsteps by claiming the events that lay ahead were inevitable, therefore creating a disbelief that spoils what is left of a completely preposterous story.Shia LaBeouf is excellent once again as the socially awkward Sam, but it's a pity (for some) that Megan Fox is once again present for her physical assets rather than acting ability. 'Revenge...' takes this a step further with cringeworthy close-ups and completely unnecessary shots of Fox showing off those seductive functions, although to be fair, the first half of the movie is edited in such a frantic and confusing manner that you're never aware of what's going on, and the significance of such. This spontaneity makes it difficult to understand what Sam's entry into college had to do with anything, and why we need stupid jokes that go against any kind of drama from the, for lack of better term, dork room mates.Talking of bad humour, it seems the transformers themselves have spent too much time around the cast as they themselves produce truly tepid one-liners that the Christmas crackers author to shame. I'm guessing the scriptwriter thought this may appeal to the hyperactive under-10's in the audience, who think things are awesome/'epic' very easy.The most frustrating aspect about this movie isn't how it could have been compressed into half the runtime, but for how in that period, it manages to conjure so many ridiculous plot holes and bad mistakes. Since when was full colour film available in 1932? How did the marines get to Egypt in under an hour? Why did no-one discover those GIANT WEAPONS inside the pyramids of Giza for over a century? Why does a transformer who's been dormant in a museum require a beard and walking stick? And why oh why, in typical American pig-ignorance, did they give him the most English of English voices just because he's a bumbling fool and knowledgeable? Jee-wizz...I should also point out that someone in the CGI department believes Optimus Prime - a behemoth weighing many tones - can casually stand on the edge of an aircraft carrier without affecting the vessels waterline or stability?Please... someone fire this guy.As a movie-going experience, this sequel is expectedly disappointing. It will please children that love two and half of hours of their daily CGI-count, but it is truly a nauseating and ridiculous product that, sadly, represents the state of the movie industry at this point in time... Hype sells.",3,0,5,15 August 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," Edge of tomorrow:a fun if hollow film
","It's always fun to watch a time-travelling and see what it does with the genre. I wrote my senior thesis on time-travelling, so when I heard about this film, needless to say, I was interested.Tom Cruise plays Major William Cage, a spineless public affairs officer, who's forced to go out on the front lines to fight an invasion against aliens who have taken over large parts of the continent of Europe. The invasion goes horribly wrong with the soldiers getting slaughtered and Cage is killed, but not before killing one of the larger aliens and getting its blood all over him. He wakes up and soon realises that every time he dies, his life 'resets' to the point when he first arrives at the military base at Heathrow airport before the invasion. Cage meets up with Sergeant Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) who is an expert soldier who tells Cage that she had the same ability to 'reset' before a blood transfusion had taken away that power. With the help of a rag-tag group of soldiers, Rita teams up with Cage to train him in the ways of being a warrior and discover how to stop the alien threat once and for all.What the many trailers and TV spots of the film do not showcase is how funny this movie is. After establishing the threat of the alien force and Cage's power, the story almost becomes a Warner Bros. cartoon with all of the comedic ways Cage manages to die. It's cathardic to see Cruise's character who had been portrayed as weak-willed get his comeuppance learning from his mistakes.The narrative focuses on the enjoyment of the structure of the story itself, and the interplay with the audience: expectations of time-travelling, the mystery of the ability, and also the question of how much Cruise's character has gone through this process to where we see the movie more from the eyes of the characters surrounding him as he's become so knowledgeable about the world and the people around him that he almost becomes 'other-worldly' even from Rita, who herself had gone through the same thing.What you will not find, however, are a cast of well-developed interesting characters. You get stock military types where they ramble soldier jargon, pound their chests in testosterone fury, and safely stay within the confines being supportive canon fodder with only one or two distinguishing characteristics about them. Despite his high listing on the cast list, Bill Paxton's character of Master Sergeant Farell's only interesting features are the speeches he frequently makes, his southern accent, and the fact he has a moustache; he's essentially just used as a talking checkpoint for the audience to reorient themselves when they travel back to specific moments whenever Cage goes back in time. Even Cage and Rita don't have much concerning layered personalities, with their only real centre of character development springing from the conceit of the time-travelling mechanic in the film and how it effects them as people.Though there isn't much of a story to be found here, 'Edge of Tomorrow' is a well-put together action film with thrilling action sequences, good pacing, and a deft understanding of how time-travelling works best in this type of film, even if the mechanic itself is not that expertly examined in the story. You could do worse in terms of spending 113 minutes on a film, and Edge of Tomorrow provides enough excitement the entire time to where one's never bored of the narrative and the structure of the film is constantly bringing up engaging action-packed scenarios.",8,0,2,22 August 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," a fitting end to an epic saga
","Back in 2001, the year when The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings I just knew this was going to be the most epic franchises ever! Every movie I saw was always an improvement of the previous. While the series ended with the most epic was possible with the Return of the King (2003), 11 years later the stories, characters & battle sequence still live in our minds. Being a fan, I was glad when Peter Jackson decided to bring back us back to Middle Earth with a prequel series - The Hobbit. A series adapted from mere 320 pages of a children's book, splitting it into three parts was always going to be a task. Although It took time realising that this was not going to have the same effect as the LOTR trilogy, it could build on its own epic ness.When The Desolation of Smaug ended on a cliffhanger as Smaug flies to lake town to destroy everything, it has been uphill task for a fan like me to wait for a year to see the epic conclusion, and how is the battle? Fantastic obviously! The movie started where the previous installment had ended. Scenes of epic destruction and fire in the lake-town are brilliantly shot. I think that if Peter Jackson wasn't the director, this battle would not work because only he can shoot the war in such a way that is both effective and jumpy. Peter Jackson is king when it comes to battle scenes, having directed what is by far the two best cinematic battles ever, in the battle of Helm's Deep and the battle of Pelennor's Field/of Minas Tirith. And even though the battle doesn't really beat those two battles, this one is still one of the all-time best. The wonder of the visual effects and action makes this battle a delight to watch. It may be long, but let me tell you, it is EPIC. After Helm's Deep, I didn't think Peter Jackson would be able to get any better. I was pleasantly surprised. Though a lot of it is CGI, the battle is carried out perfectly. The fighting, effects and acting are brilliant and everyone who worked on the film deserves a big pat on the back. Besides the battle itself and the opening sequence, there's an undeniably magnificent relationship between Thorin and Bilbo in this movie. The chemistry between the two shines bright, and is one of the strongest aspects of the entire film and the entire trilogy as a whole. Martin Freeman has done excellent work as Bilbo Baggins and shown us that his acting talents are not limited only to Sherlock. While not given the amount of screen time as he was given in the first two Hobbit films, is still perfect as Bilbo - perfect! He really captures the essence and personality of Bilbo beautifully! Richard is amazing as Thorin and every character has performed greatly. Armitage in particular brings the best performance he's given in the trilogy, as Thorin's character-arc is very interesting and quite dark in this film and Armitage pulls that off in spades. You also have Lee Pace as Thranduil, who also performs at the top of his game. Contrary to his performance as the ill-wicked Ronan the Accuser in the last summer's Guardians of the Galaxy, Pace is really given the opportunity to shine here and works really well together with Armitage to form this ill rivalry between the two. Sir Ian McKellen knocks his role as Gandalf the Grey out of the park once again. But that is as obvious as sunrise and sunset. Another standout is Orlando Bloom as Legolas. Most of you people probably already know that Legolas is not in the book. This topic is often a hotly debated one, with some people saying that he has no place being there and that he's just forced into the film, while others, like me, thinks that he does add something to the film. another character who is often hated for being a non-canon character is Tauriel - a character that I also love. Evangeline Lily brings such a great presence to the film. It is often in movies that you don't believe when there's a badass female hero or villain. You can tell that that person couldn't even lift a sword and that the only reason to why she's a badass is because it says so in the script. Well, that's not the case with Tauriel or Lily as Tauriel, she's a force to be reckon with, and challenges often Legolas in terms of who is a bigger badass! Even though I still wasn't completely sold on the whole romance front (still like it though) between Tauriel and Kili - played very well by Aidan Turner, one of my favourite dwarfs of the entire company. Luke Evans as Bard is just as interesting and relevant as in the last one. Evans manages to bring out more depth and charisma & at times manages to steal the thunder from the rest of the cast! Benedict cumberbatch's voice-over of Smaug is delicious! Though it is the shortest movie in the series, it is enough, satisfactory and not remotely boring. Believe me folks this is worth your bucks. It is not just a movie, it is a cinematic experience even non-hobbit fans will enjoy. To sum it all up; The Battle of the Five Armies brings to a spectacular conclusion the legend of Middle-Earth. It is the ending of a 9-hour film and to certain extent, the ending to the full, now, 21-hour saga. In ten years we can look upon these films as six chapters of what is ultimately one story. And in ten years the Middle- Earth films will still live on. Battle Of Five Armies is a brilliant, emotional & fitting way to end the Middle-Earth saga!",10,18,39,14 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," How far would you go for the one you love
","This film is everything that the Episodes I and II should've been. Yes, there is a slight cheese factor in this movie with some of the dialogue, although I would say that Lucas has significantly improved in that area. I watched in complete agony as Anakin Skywalker completed his transformation into Darth Vader; I knew it was inevitable, but I had no idea that the transformation would be so emotionally powerful. Another improvement is Christiansen (Anakin). While I had no problem with his performance in Episode II (some critics called it 'wooden', I say it was perfect for the nature of his character), he shows a wider array of emotions in this. He's lost and confused, and the Dark Side is an emotional comfort, especially when he learns that it can save Padme from death.The film opens with a battle scene between the Republic and the Sith Lord and his apprentice, Count Dooku, who has kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine. The special effects in this scene are awesome; it's amazing to see an all out space battle between so many ships. Anakin and Obi Wan are sent to save Palpatine. There's a wicked lightsaber fight between Ani/Obi and Dooku, in which Obi Wan is injured, with Anakin ultimately slicing off Dooku's hands and holding two light sabers up to Dooku's neck. Palpatine hisses at Anakin to finish him. Anakin's not sure; it's not the Jedi way. But he does it anyway, becoming angry at himself for letting his emotions get away from him. Afterward, Anakin rejoins Padme (their wedding is still secret), who tells him the news of her pregnanacy. I love Anakin's face when she tells him-- he's happy, but worried, and not just for her but for himself. It's the kind of face a 15 year old boy would make when his 15 year old girlfriend says, 'I'm pregnant.' The story continues, with them keeping their love a secret, as well as keeping the fact that Anakin is the father of Padme's unborn baby a secret. Soon, Anakin is consumed with fear, waking up sweaty after having dreamt Padme died in childbirth. You really get a sense of their love for each other in this, their unbelievably strong love, which is the catalyst for all of Anakin's actions that will make you say, 'I can't believe he did that.' His love escalates into obsession and into fear. As most of us know, fear is the path to the Dark Side, as outlined by Master Yoda in Episode I. The pair attempt to keep the lines of communication open, but when Anakin pledges allegiance to Darth Sidious (with hopes of keeping Padme alive), the communication stops. Anakin is Darth Vader. And he didn't even need the suit or helmet to make it happen.I absolutely love this movie. I definitely want to see it again at the theater-- especially for the lava scene, in which Anakin and Obi Wan have that much-hyped lightsaber duel, which totally lives up to the hype times ten. What happens in this scene is intense, so intense that I actually cried. I wasn't the only one either; not only were other theater-goers boo-hooing, but Anakin himself even sheds a few tears throughout this movie, frustrated and confused with himself. He is his own worst enemy.The saga is complete now. I actually appreciate Episodes I and II even more now after having seen Episode III. I refuse to pick a favorite. I'll take them all. I love the journey.",10,1,5,4 August 2014
Inception," A must see film
","I cannot believe it has taken me this long to get round to watching Inception I finally succumbed to the hype and can confirm that it was 100% deserved. Inception is a cleverly crafted film that will blow you away with its star studded (and very talented) cast, stunning CGI and mind boggling plot.A whole host of famous actors star in Inception from Leonardo dicaprio to Tom Hardy to Joseph Gordon-Levitt to Ellen Page. I don't think I can fault a single move or sound that came from these actors who all gave flawless performances. I cannot pinpoint which character or actor stood out the most to me because they were all equally brilliant. Leonardo DI Caprio is probably the actor who got to show the greatest spread of emotion and showcase different sides to his acting as his character is involved in a love story. This story permeates throughout the entire film, though rather strangely, few other characters are involved in it at all. This addition to the story just gave the film a little extra something and added an emotional level to this cool-as-a-cucumber film.I do not think I have ever seen a film with such stunning CGI effects. Hats off to whoever was in control of the effects because they were truly brilliant and breathtaking at times. Inception deals with dreams within dreams (sometimes dreams within dreams within dreams!), in which the subconscious is allowed to create whatever world it desires and the cities created in this film were simply amazing whether it be a modern Western city, a Japanese city or even a ski slope. If only it were possible to fold a city in half with roads replacing the sky. It was not only the CGI used to create the scenery that was impressive, but also the effects used during the action sequences. There were plenty of fights during this movie, most, but not all, involving gunfire and the fluidity of the on screen action was astounding. This is not ordinary action though, in one case there was even a fight when the gravity had been switched off and ceiling became floor and vice versa multiple times. It was just so ... cool! James Bond has nothing on these guys.Alongside the brilliant CGI effects there was really great cinematography. Now I don't really know anything about filming or the technical side of film-making but it's impossible not to notice the fluidity between shots and the capturing of perfect angles. There's also a really great soundtrack which just gives this film that extra umpf and makes everything more dramatic and tense. This film will not only play with your mind, but also your senses as you're assaulting by an array of brilliant sights and sounds.All in all, Inception is undoubtedly one of the best films of the decade and I don't think I can fault it in anyway.This is a must see film for everyone that will keep you entertained for every second.",10,1,3,21 February 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," A perfect end to a perfect trilogy
","Having been a huge fan of Chris Nolan's previous two Batman films, couldn't wait to watch this when it was released. And The Dark Knight Rises didn't disappoint. The conclusion to the trilogy is fitting for the franchise, for Batman, and for Bruce Wayne (though I have read rumours that Nolan might come back for another film in the series or maybe a Batman/Superman film - hope some of this is true!).The film starts with a frail Bruce Wayne having pretty much retired and living a private life eight years after he eliminated the Joker. The peaceful Gotham City where police officers feel they will soon be 'chasing overdue library books' is rocked by a series of events orchestrated by the ferocious and calculating villain, Bane.The pace of this film is slightly slower (and heavier) compared to the previous two films, partly because there are a lot more characters in this film, and Nolan being the master storyteller that he is, gives each character enough time in the film. It could seem a bit lengthy at 3 hours of thereabout because of this. Lucius Fox and Alfred return in their usual roles of being Batman's brains and soul respectively. Michael Caine's performance as Alfred is simply remarkable even though his screen time is somewhat limited in the film. Gary Oldman excellent in his role as Commissioner Gordon he is one of the many standouts in this film and his and Batman's (Bale) chemistry is superb . Christian Bale, as usual, has done a great job portraying the battles within Bruce Wayne - overcoming his hears and rising from being as good as dead to come back to save his beloved city. His character comes a full circle from the first film as Thomas Wayne's words 'why do we fall down Bruce' echo through this film and Bruce seemingly understands their meaning here as he prepares to pick himself up and 'rise'.New characters added a refreshing touch to the series. Anne Hathaway is brilliant in her role as Selina Kyle. She lightens up the serious macho overdose of the film with her flair and flamboyant ways. Bane, with links to the League of Shadows, brings a dark element unlike any Gotham has witnessed before. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays John (Robin) Blake perhaps a younger version of Jim Gordon. He seems to be set to take over the reins from Commissioner Gordon, but eventually chooses to stay free of the shackles imposed by structure and protocols by the GCPD. Marion Cotillard (I thought she was brilliant in Inception) plays a convincing partner and love interest of Bruce Wayne.The conclusion is definitely a lot heavier in terms of content and pace compared to the previous two films. This film requires focused attention to the dialogue and sequence of events, previous 2 films seem somewhat lighter compared to this one. The fact that Bane's voice was muffled with his mask doesn't help in this regard, it only increases the level of focus one needs to have which watching the film. In addition, the film has more characters with their place in the film. Chris Nolan has spent a fair amount of time with each character to fully bring out their roles and let the audiences savour the nuances of their personalities, inner conflicts, and goals. I personally think the running time at 164 mins was needed to be this long and I thought it increased experience of watching the film. Some scenes make Batman seem too human, like the street fight scene with Bane towards the end. Batman is a superhero and it feels somewhat strange to see him battle his enemy bare hands in the middle of a street-fight. It's still an awesome scene though. That being said, there are plenty of new toys in his arsenal and the Bat, in particular, is awesome!Yes, the performance of Heath Ledger and the compelling storytelling of The Dark Knight are hard to match, but TDKR is an appropriate and epic conclusion to what I think is one of the best series of super-hero films made to date.",10,3,9,29 July 2014
Iron Man," The movie that kicked of the MCU
","Iron Man is one of the best adaptations of comic book entertainment to the world of film. In my view only the Christian Bale Batman is as excellent a story and production as the tale of the Iron Man. Robert Downey Jnr is fantastically cast as Tony Stark, playboy industrialist and genius. As a weapons manufacturer and womaniser, Stark is set up as a character without morals and with only his own quest for pleasure able to match his inquisitive desire to build bigger and better weapons. It all goes wrong within moments of the opening credits though as on a trip to Afghanistan (and trust me it really does look like Afghanistan) his convoy is attacked and he is taken prisoner. From there, Stark builds the foundation of his Iron Man.It is the first part of the film that is truly awesome. Downey Jnr's own decadent lifestyle plays so well into the character of Stark and the arrogance that accompanies a genius who knows his position is delicious. His winning way with people and the awe with which the squaddies look up to him in the moment before his convoy is hit are moments of cinematic greatness.The part of the film where robots are fighting each other is less fun. I'm not a fan of the Transformers film and I didn't like the same robot action here. The process that turns Stark into the Iron Man both in the cave and then when perfecting the suit in California are what makes this film work so excellently.There are plot holes just as there are in any blockbuster. The sentimentality of the reporting on a refugee crisis is cringeworthy. The deliberate attempt to de-Arabise the terrorist group is pointless as those who fail to see the difference still won't while those who do will not be convinced. Despite all that this is still a great film. Jeff Bridges is a great presence and his bald pate and beard make his character really stand out. Bridges carries a sophistication in his characterisation that makes him a believable Chief Executive weighing up every situation to his own best advantage. Even Gwyneth Paltrow puts in a decent turn helped by an excellent mop of hair. All in all a great start to the MCU",9,0,1,4 May 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," People fear what they don't understand
","Following the events of 'Man of Steel', Superman has announced himself to the world, which has caused a divide in humanity: some see him as a saviour, whilst others see him as the ultimate threat to earth. Siding with those who see Superman as a threat, Gotham City-based vigilante Batman travels to Metropolis to combat Superman. However, a much graver threat looks to endanger humanity.After many years of development, excitement, anticipation and scepticism, two of the biggest characters in all of fiction, come face to face together for the first time in a live-action movie. There's not just the pressure of the two icons first live-action met though, but also the pressure of establishing the 'DC extended universe', a new cinematic universe featuring DC comics' line up of characters, set to the rival the successful 'Marvel Cinematic Universe'. I'm pleased to say that it is successful on both fronts.Despite all that needed to be achieved in the film with all the threads that it has: setting up new characters, character arcs, back story, plot and just overall world-building, the film is fairly well balanced and structured, with good character development, interesting and emotional themes and moves at a breezy pace, even though the runtime is 2 and a half hours, thanks to writer Chris Terrio's solid script. The dark tone continues from 'Man of Steel', but the film does have humour in it with great witty one-liners and comments, some of the best coming from Jeremy Irons' Alfred. The humour isn't over the top though and there's just the right amount there. The mature tone gives the film tension and weight, allowing you to invest in the characters and the situation.Of the many scepticism of the film, casting has probably been the main one, in particular the choice of Ben Affleck for Bruce Wayne/Batman. Affleck however has been cast well in the role, bringing grit and gravitas. His interpretation is one that has not been seen on screen before. Affleck's Wayne is like a war veteran, who has been fighting for 20 years and has lost so much along the way and it has taken its total on him. He is more ruthless and hardened, losing his way and boarding on a villain at times. A lot is implied and a solo Batman film with Affleck will be something interesting to watch in the future.Much anxiety surrounded the casting of Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman as well, but again, they have chosen right. When she appears on screen, particularly when she is in action, you really believe she is Wonder Woman. She is a supporting player in this, so we don't see her as much as the title characters, but she has enough of a presence to be established and spark interest for her upcoming solo film out next year.The third and final piece of controversial casting came in the form of Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. Here Eisenberg gives a performance of the character, like with Affleck's Batman, that we have not seen on screen before. This didn't work for me, all i saw was an OCD version of Jessie Eisenberg and i understand that he is playing lex luthor Jr not Sr but i would've much preferred the lex luthor we all know and mostly love, just imagine watching Bryan Cranston sharing scenes with Ben Affleck and Henry Cavil. Jessie Eisenberg is a good actor but he wasn't right for the role.Henry Cavill gives another great performance as Clark Kent/Superman. He once again portrays a more complicated and humanised Superman, one that's more interesting to watch than previous film versions and much more in line with the comics. His arc ties in nicely with Batman's, as they both experience something of an existential crisis.There's not as much action as you might think with a film like this, which is not a criticism, but an observation. When there is action though, it's really exciting too watch and every scene is well choreographed, with some ambitious set pieces. It never feels like an attack on the senses, like a lot of its contemporaries and it feeds into the character arcs and the story, like all great action should.Hans Zimmer returns to provide the music for the film, with the addition of Junkie XL, fresh off last years successful 'Mad Max: Fury Road'. It does what all great music should in a film, heightening the experience and often making the hairs raise on the back of the neck. However, it is great and at times epic, but it does not reach the heights of previous work, in particular, Hans Zimmer's.The pressure was on, but Snyder and his team have delivered a film that we not only deserve, but one we need right now. It's dark, emotional, witty, ambitious, epic and the dawn of an exciting new franchise.",8,7,14,27 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A fantastic return to a galaxy far far away
","Its finally here. After Disney's $4 Billion acquisition of Lucasfilm back in 2012, the announcement that there would be a sequel trilogy beginning with a 7th episode in the beloved franchise was met with intrigue and excitement by fans everywhere. I am a longtime fan of the saga(both the originals and prequels to a degree); and I have spent countless dollars on games(most recently Star Wars Battlefront) , books, and tuned in to the cartoon Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star wars rebels from time to time.This review will be lengthy, but there is so much to say about Star Wars: The Force Awakens.Starting with the actors, Star Wars The Force Awakens has a star-studded cast. John Boyega, who I have followed since his role in the film Attack the Block, stars as Finn alongside actress Daisy Ridley who plays Rey. They are very likable as the main protagonists, with Finn wanting to leave his life behind as a stormtrooper and Rey being a self-reliant person from the planet Jakku. I also very much enjoyed Oscar Isaac's role as X-Wing pilot Poe Dameron; and I hope we see more of his character in the future Star Wars films. It was nice to see the return of characters like Chewbacca, Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia, and seeing Harrison Ford make his return as Han Solo garnered a round of applause from the audience and myself. Andy Serkis stars as Supreme Leader Snoke and does a nice job, while Gwendoline Christie portrays Captain Phasma. Domhnall Gleeson makes his character General Hux a memorably vocal antagonist. But perhaps most satisfying of all the characters is Adam Driver's Kylo Ren. My friends and I discussed Star Wars: The Force Awakens well before its release, and though our opinions differed, we all agreed that the movie absolutely needed a imposing and memorable villain. And Kylo Ren is just that. I enjoyed how much Star Wars: The Force Awakens explored Kylo's persona and duality; while at the same time giving explanation as to how he came to be just who he is.The story in Star Wars: The Force Awakens adds new elements but has constant reminders that will delight Star Wars fans(as they did me) of why they are fans of the popular space opera in the first place. JJ Abrams incorporates humour into Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but it works very well. And there are numerous surprises , and some moments that hit your emotional side.And even better, the action scenes in the movie are absolutely wonderful. The lightsaber battles are noticeably different here than previous films, and the familiar theme music that we all know and love will definitely be heard in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Taking over the directorial duties for a Star Wars film is no easy task, but JJ Abrams has done an impressive job creating this film.I'd like to point out that the ONLY problem I had with Star Wars: The Force Awakens is that there were certain characters I would have like to have seen have more screen time. But even still, Star Wars: The Force Awakens delivers spectacle, and wonder thanks to the talented cast, the direction of JJ Abrams, and the likable combination of old/new elements to the I sincerely hope everyone enjoys Star Wars: The Force Awakens as much as I did. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a nice reminder that this is why we go to the movies. And truthfully, I am excited to see where the franchise goes next.",10,43,105,20 December 2015
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," It All Ends
","Regardless of your views on Harry Potter as a whole or whether this film really does this literary phenomenon justice (on balance it does), there can be no doubt that this is a great climax to one of the great cinematic challenges. There will always be a debate about the place of J.K. Rowling's novels and their film adaptations in the wider pantheon of literary and film history. But if one wants a true measure of how good this series has been, they should simply ask: what would the world be like if Harry hadn't been helped out of his cupboard?I know that the answer is: poorer! The first novels that I read were the first two Harry Potter books. And to a child at the age of 6, as I was then, what wasn't there to like about a downtrodden young boy who discovers that he is a wizard and is whisked away to a magic school by a giant man? That is the magic of this series. Long after the special effects have been superseded and there has been a disastrous (American) attempt at remaking the films, it will be the stories that remain with us. We all want to be Harry, Ron or Hermione because we can relate to them. We believe that we can have Harry's courage, Ron's heart or Hermione's fierce loyalty and skill because we have experienced their emotions alongside our own. That is the reason for the success of these novels and films: We could just as easily imagine ourselves as I think that the leads did well in this film; and whatever people say about their acting at various stages, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson will always be Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. But the real star turn, as in the novel, comes from Severus Snape. Alan Rickman really steals the show, as he has done throughout the series. We have loved to hate this man for the last decade on screen, but the superb execution of 'The Prince's Tale' leaves us feeling as devastated as Snape himself is when he learns that Lily Potter is dead. I think we all shed a tear for the incredible sacrifices that he made, as much as Rickman's superlative performance. Maggie Smith is as imperious as ever as Minerva McGonagall, whilst Helena Bonham Carter is sublime as the wildly cunning Bellatrix Lestrange. Ralph Fiennes simply exudes menace whenever he is on screen as our irredeemable villain, Lord Voldemort. He takes on a rather muted role here, strangely, although I do think that the way in which the menace of Voldemort is portrayed in the novels is almost impossible to bring to the big screen. The scene in the Forbidden Forest with the Resurrection Stone is also a brilliant emotional journey. Plus it's always nice to see Gary Oldman back in the role of Sirius for such a short amount of screen time he is wonderful and David Thewlis is great as well as lupin.The special effects are excellent as one might expect, especially when the magical protection is created around Hogwarts, to then be destroyed by Voldemort in fury. Alexandre Desplat's score is also superb and really reflects the subtle moods and nuances of the story. If one good thing came out of the Epilogue, it allowed Desplat to use the brilliant 'Leaving Hogwarts' theme for the last time! As a film, I think that David Yates has done a great job. This was probably the biggest challenge in film. Almost everyone had an opinion on how it should be done, along with the added pressure from Warner Brother's to make this film palatable for all ages, in order to maximise potential income from their most lucrative franchise. Left to their own devices, this film could easily have been a 15. For those who think that a lot of the humour is missing, then they are probably right. However, it is harder to establish this in a film. The Potter series doesn't really do black humour, so many of the jokes or asides in the novel just wouldn't fit the tone. I think the result would have been worse if the producers had attempted to shoe- horn the humour in.All in all, it has been a magical journey since I first picked up 'The Philosopher's Stone as a 6 year old. As the credits rolled on this film, I suddenly realised that there was no more Harry, no more vestige of my childhood, to come. But then I thought that it doesn't really matter that there will be no more 'new' adventures. The magic of the series, its values of courage and loyalty and friendship, will live on. And naturally, we will always want to go to Hogwarts.",10,0,4,17 August 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," one movie to rule them all
","Peter Jackson's epic adaptation of 'Lord of the Rings' reaches its pinnacle in 'Return of the King.' The stellar cast, mind-blowing special effects and heartbreaking script are all present in the third movie, which is not only the last of the 'Lord of the Rings' films, but the best.Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are still following the treacherous Gollum (Andy Serkis) on the path to Mordor, with the increasingly strained Frodo unaware that Gollum is sowing suspicion between the two best friends. By the time he realises his mistake, he's been dragged into the lair of Shelob, a monstrous spider, and then abducted by orcs who want the Ring he carries. Determined to find his friend, Sam heads into an orc citadel...Meanwhile, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) takes Pippin (Billy Boyd) with him to Minas Tirith, after the hobbit has a close encounter with Sauron through a palantir. \Not only is the city under siege, but the Steward Denethor is slowly going insane, even sending his one remaining son, Faramir (David Wenham), on a suicide mission to reclaim a dead city. With Minas Tirith crumbling, Aragorn's (Viggo Mortensen) only hope may to be summon an army of the dead, who will only obey the King of Gondor. But even the dead won't help him if Frodo doesn't destroy the Ring...The 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy is one of those once-in-a-lifetime movie experiences. There has never been anything quite like it in movie history, and there probably never will be again. It seems somehow fitting that the book that every other fantasy has to measure up to, has now become a sweeping cinematic triumph that actually stays halfway loyal to the books. Good things come to fans who wait, I guess.Peter Jackson really outdoes himself. You know those battle scenes in 'Two Towers' and 'Fellowship of the Ring,' with the swooping camera and thousands of orcs, clashing with men on a gloomy battlefield? In 'Return of the King,' Jackson surpasses that. There's everything from volcanic eruptions to an invasion of howling ghosts to the attack of the oliphaunts (like elephants, only bigger). Each action scene a shattering ride, and there's no guarantee that all the beloved characters will make it out alive. Some of them don't.But if Jackson manages the epic battles well, he does an even better job with the gentler, quieter moments. The action slows down, and the characters take a moment to support and comfort each other. They cry, they hug, they think about home -- such as Gandalf comforting the frightened Pippin with a description of the afterlife. Jackson and his fellow screenwriters Fran Walsh and Phillippa Boyens throw themselves into the semi-formal language of Tolkien's world, resculpting Tolkien's words into equally rich movie dialogue.Elijah Wood gives an unparallelled performance as Frodo Baggins. Frodo's gradual deterioration is wrenching to watch, and the climactic scene at Mount Doom displays just what the Ring can do to even the pure-hearted hobbit. Sean Astin follows up with his powerful performance as Sam, who is increasingly the 'strong' hobbit, rather than the follower. The final scenes between these two outstanding actors are beautiful and understated.But all the supporting cast also give powerful performances -- Boyd and Dominic Monaghan put their characters through some intense growing pains, and the 'I'm going to take care of you' scene is enough to bring tears to your eyes. Mortensen gets more kingly every moment, while Ian McKellen balances action with grandfatherly wisdom. Bernard Hill has a quietly moving final scene, while Miranda Otto makes the despairing Eowyn a strong, kick-butt heroine.Perhaps the most striking thing about 'Return of the King' is the final fourth of the film. While the 'multiple endings' may annoy some viewers, it seems somehow right to gently let go of these characters rather than have a sudden, splashy finale. And whether they have a happy or sad ending, Jackson never lets us forget that they all made sacrifices to battle Sauron.'Return of the King' brings the epic 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy to a close, and cements Jackson's reputation as a master filmmaker. With the outstanding cast, beautiful scripting and amazing direction, this is the best of the 'Lord' films -- and that's saying something.",10,3,5,18 January 2015
Godzilla," The king is back
","The scene in Godzilla between Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binouche near the beginning is a powerful moment, and the sold-out, IMAX 3D audience I watched it with sat in stunned silence throughout it. We've been trained not to expect scenes like the one above in a summer blockbuster that features CGI monsters knocking each other out, and the audience reacted accordingly—I don't think many were expecting to be tearing up in a movie called GODZILLA. As the doors closed on Juliette Binoche someone behind me whispered 'Daaaaaang', and that's when I knew director Gareth Edwards, arguably the next Steven Spielberg, had delivered with his sophomore film. His first film, Monsters, was an indie flick made for half a million dollars. That Legendary Studios and Warner Brothers believed in him enough to give him 160 million for this one says a lot.It helps that Edwards clearly respects what came before: GODZILLA contains Jurassic Park references (a bus driver wipes the fog from his windshield to see Godzilla just like Malcolm does to see the Tyrannosaur), Jaws references (his spines cut through the water in extended shots just like the shark's fin; the BRODY family), Close Encounters of the Third Kind references (Cranston sneaks into a military site, nobody believes his wild theories); there's even a Mothra reference. What helps even more is that Edwards fills the film with talent: the aforementioned Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche give what could quite possibly be the best performances in a monster film ever; Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins plays scientists studying Godzilla; Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen play a husband and wife torn apart by the monsters' destruction. It helps that every single one of these actors have been in acclaimed indie movies before, for none of them act like they're in a dumb summer movie. Instead, all treat the material like they were in a smaller, more personal film, an edict Edwards himself personally told Cranston and Binoche to follow. This elevates the film immensely, making the film more about the Brody family then Godzilla himself. (Herself?)When Godzilla does show up though, it's glorious. Complete with motion-capture effects by the brilliant Andy Serkis (who played Gollum in the LOTR trilogy and Caesar in Rise of the Planet of the Apes) Godzilla lives and breathes like a real creature we empathize with, feel for. He's bigger and meaner than ever before, but at the same time the movie makes him our savior. He's only here to restore balance, and the film makes it a point to show that he's not out to directly cause harm to mankind. He causes a tsunami simply rising up out of Waikiki Beach, killing hundreds if not thousands in its wake, but it's only to fight off another monster: a winged M.U.T.O. (Massive Unidentified Terrestial Organism) currently wreaking havoc across Hawaii. Later on his spines shield a bus full of children from some stray missiles carelessly launched by a panicked Navy cruiser.Though the trailers are a bit misleading—despite what they make you think, it's Taylor- Johnson who carries the film, not Cranston—Johnson carries the film superbly. Many reviews have criticized Johnson for being 'flat' or 'unemotive'; it's simply not true. He's a soldier, he's trained to act that way—take it from someone who's not only worked at a Air Base for two years, but someone who's dated a girl leaving for the Air Force and is best friends with a current Army soldier. When Johnson is suited up and with gear, he acts exactly like a soldier should. He gets a couple nice scenes with his wife and son early on too, and there he doesn't act like a soldier, he acts like a husband and father. He laughs with his son. He tells stories with his wife. He emotes perfectly fine.Even when the film does slow down a bit with several scenes of exposition, 'perfectly fine' is still an able description of it. At it's best it's applause-worthy though, and my audience burst into applause several times at key moments. Those key moments are worthy of the biggest screen you can find; when Edwards finally cuts loose and lets the monsters rumble, nothing can prepare you for the amount of awe-inducing shots. Director of Photography Seamus McGarvey crafts some of the best wide shots I've ever seen before, Edwards and Editor Bob Ducsay keep the cuts to a minimum and give us several extended tracking shots of sheer mayhem, and Alexandre Desplat gives the film a booming, awesome score worthy of the King of Monsters. Akira Ifukube's classic Gojira theme is missing, but Desplat makes sure you never actually miss it. If there's anything to miss, it's Olsen herself—outside of some brief scenes running away from monsters, she's not given nearly as much to do as everyone else. At times it feels like her runtime was cut, but it's not detrimental to the movie as a whole.Still, Godzilla is given plenty of screen time. Many have also complained that the titular creature merely cameos; those that complain must subscribe to the Michael Bay school of thought that explosions and action must carry on for hours on end. What Edwards has done here gives us a more thoughtful, slow-burn monster movie that builds to a fantastic climax, and it does pay off much better than any Transformers movie ever has. Think of it this way: in the original 1954 Godzilla, he only gets 17 minutes of screen time. Darth Vader is only in 12 minutes of 'A New Hope'. The Joker is only in 33 minutes of the 152 minute 'The Dark Knight'. Edward's Godzilla is only in about 20 minutes of the movie but like the above examples, it feels like a lot more.At the end of the day the king is back and Gareth Edwards tried to make the film the best he could and succeeded .Grade: A-",10,7,15,1 August 2014
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A long time ago in a galaxy far far away
","I saw the original 'Star Wars' (you can keep calling it 'Episode IV: A New Hope' all you want, I do not have to go along with it) in a theater far and away more times than any other movie (low double figures). I saw 'Star Wars' as much as the films I saw the second and third most often in a movie theater, which would be, of course, 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'The Return of the Jedi.' I even sat through the movie twice in a row, the first time so I could pay attention to everything that happened in the lower left quadrant of the film and the second time so I could watch the lower right quadrant.Watch the film again for the first time in several years three things stuck out in my mind as to why this film got us so excited way back when. The first, as noted above, was how there was so to look at in this film. Nobody ever laughed at the alien in the sunglasses trailing after the good guys at Mois Eisley, but in addition to the all the weird looking aliens in the Cantina and throughout the film there was the way this galaxy far, far away looked like it had been lived in. The idea that the Millennium Falcon is not only the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy but actually looks like a hunk of junk mattered. Even the wacky white armor of the Storm Troopers meant something to us, even if we questioned its functionality. You could reduce Han Solo to his grin, Princess Leia to her hairdo, and Luke Skywalker to his lightsaber, because the costumes and art design were things we had never seen before. Of course, Darth Vader being able to think people to death was pretty impressive.The second is that if there is any one thing that made 'Star Wars' move than a 'B' movie made with an 'A' budget it is the musical score by John Williams. The composer had won his first Oscar two years earlier for 'Jaws' and was also nominated for 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' when he won again for 'Star Wars.' One of the things we did because we could not go and sit in the theater watching 'Star Wars' all day was to listen to the double-album for the movie's soundtrack (yes, I probably listened to this soundtrack more than any other in history than did not require singing 'The Time Warp' or any other song). I do not know how much of the movie is scored to music, but it has to be an extremely high percentage, albeit short of what you would get with a silent film. The only movie score that I find comparable is the one Ennio Morricone did for 'Once Upon a Time in the West,' especially in terms of have motifs associated with characters.The final thing that made this movie great was the entire final sequence where the Rebels attack the Death Star. The X-Wing fighters are still the coolest I have ever seen, despite what we have seen from 'Battlestar Galactica' to 'Farscape' and everything in between. I would really love to see the complete original template George Lucas put together for the special effects crew spliced together from World War II movies. Not only do we have the drama of the 'Dam Busters' runs on the Death Star, but the sequences provides a number of memorable characters, most of whose names we never learn: Red Leader (Drewe Henley), Red Two (Dennis Lawson), Red Four (Jack Klaff), Red Six (William Hootkins), Gold Leader (Angus Mcinnis), Gold Two (Jeremy Sinden), and Gold Five (Graham Ashley). Everything that happened was so vivid that when listening to the lengthy 'Battle of Yavin' cut on the soundtrack I swear we could recreate every shot in our minds.Perhaps the best way of describing the impact of 'Star Wars' is to say that it must have been similar to what happened a generation or two earlier when Dorothy opened the door to Oz and the screen went from sepia tones to Technicolor. It was an introduction to a whole new world. Even if we never saw a Saturday morning serial we could appreciate the idea of a roller coaster type of ride where Sand People attack, the Millennium Falcon has to escape the Death Star, and the Rebel base is almost within range.In terms of the controversy over the way George Lucas has tinkered with his 1977 film, I have already bought into the idea of the director's cut, so it is hard to fault the director for having a slightly different definition of that from others. I remember how outdated the special effects looked three years later when 'Empire' came out, so updating them makes sense to me. The scene with Jabba sets up what happens in the rest of the original trilogy and I think the scene with Biggs before the attack is important simply because I think the idea that the last person killed is Luke's best friend. Besides, I have the film we saw in 1977 preserved in a letterboxed edition on laser disc and can still watch it whenever I want.Actually, what surprised me the most with this 'final' version of the original 'Star Wars' movie was how tacky the attempts by Lucas to retroactively fix his character's flaws. To be clear that Han Solo is not a cold blooded killer Greedo now shoots first, although he is an incredible bad shot, especially from four feet away. Then there was the shock that Leia no long kisses Luke on the lips 'For luck' before they swing across that chasm. Now it is a chaste little peck on the cheek.",10,1,2,4 August 2014
Deadpool," The greatest movie apology ever
","Deadpool, if you casually dip in and out of the comic genre, is a superhero. You may have heard the name somewhere on screen before, but probably forgotten. However, if you know your comics then you probably salivated at the prospect of seeing the 'merc with a mouth' going toe to toe with Wolverine in the X-man's 'origins' movie. Then you watched it and uttered words that no self-respecting spell checker should let me type.Basically, the makers of Wolverine: Origins completely messed up (putting it mildly) and the fans were not amused. Yes, Ryan Reynolds was actually a pretty good choice for the gobby anti-hero, but then they pretty much cellotaped his mouth shut and completely reinvented his character in the worst way possible. It actually makes a nice change to see a studio admit they totally got it wrong and do something about it (even if the decision is largely governed by money!).And that could have been that. However, luckily Mr Reynolds himself campaigned to bring a truer representation of the source material to the big screen. And, amazingly, it happened. And I'm so glad it did.Deadpool, is a superhero movie. You probably guessed that – you have the man in a mask who you pretty much know is going to go out there and beat the baddies and save the girl, yadder, yadder, yadder... However, what Deadpool also is, is a comedy. That being said – it's NOT a spoof. It's a tongue-in-cheek little number which has better action scenes than most action films and better comedy than most comedy films.I'm almost tempted to say that it's a film that anyone can enjoy. I can certainly see both men and women having a good time watching it. However, it definitely is a film for MEN and WOMEN. Whereas Marvel's current cinematic universe is kind of geared at kids (and us kids who never grew up) there is plenty in Deadpool that no parent will want to explain to their little darling. Again, don't let that fool you into thinking that it's all toilet humour – let's just call it 'adult' humour and leave it at that.Basically, Deadpool is great. Ryan Reynolds is mouthy, but never annoying and totally owns the role (as it should be when he plays the titular character). The supporting cast all do their bit, but it's Deadpool himself all the way. Please let this be the start of a franchise. It's probably a little too much to expect to see him crossing studio picket lines and ending up in the Marvel universe where he – truly – belongs, but we can always hope. If nothing else, I'm well up for a 'Deadpool 2' outing.",10,6,19,6 March 2016
Fast Five," The most important thing in life will always be the people in this room right here, right now
","In the first sequence of Fast Five, Brian, (the late great Paul Walker), Mia (jordana Brewster) and a third unknown driver attempt to rescue Dom, who was arrested at the end of Fast and Furious, from a prison bus. To make an cool action set piece short, Brian and Mia flip the damn bus over and get Dom out of it (somehow). I remember when I saw this action sequence for the first time, I realised the absurd hilarity of it all and so I whispered to my closest friend, 'we should try that some time.' My whole group proceeded to laugh at my remark, and then we shared quite a few laughs throughout the rest of the movie. Now, thinking back on that bus flipping moment, I begin to realise that Fast Five might have been that one movie that made me really appreciate fun, mindless action movies.After Brian and Mia manage to get Dom out of police custody, the trio meets up in Rio where they're joined by Vince (Schulze) from the original Fast and the Furious. Vince tells them that they need to steal some cars from a moving train and you bet your ass it's as awesome as it sounds. After a glorious action sequence on board a train, Fast Five introduces Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson, who plays my second favourite character of the franchise here), a Diplomatic Security Service agent who wants to hunt Dom and his crew down and bring them all into custody. Meanwhile, Dom and his team (who I'll call 'Dom's Ten') create a plan to steal $100 million from a crazy Brazilian guy named Reyes in a much cooler style than Danny Ocean's master plan of stealing millions of dollars from three Las Vegas casinos.Fast Five has, undoubtedly, a story that drives very far away from those original racing roots that the series was known for back in the day. But this is what I ultimately dig about this series: its ability to evolve with each new sequel. There's something oddly glorious about a franchise that used to be about bros and hungry people racing cars transforming into a franchise about those same people attempting to steal $100 million dollars from a vault by dragging the vault out of a building and through the streets of Rio, putting hundreds of people in harm's way.Now that is what I call entertainment!A great addition to Fast Five is Dwayne the Rock Johnson who is one of the most charismatic people on the entire planet. Seriously, you could give that guy a horrible script and he would turn it into gold. With Fast Five, he is given gold and turns it into a damn diamond; the guy is magic. He's one of the few examples (Dave Bautista being a new example) of a wrestler- turned-actor that has actually succeeded as an actor in the long run. With his most recent appearance at WrestleMania 31,Johnson is a figure that can both be a welcomed addition to a movie and then can be welcomed back into the squared circle the very next day. In Fast Five, the Rock steals the show whenever he shows up because he's such a great screen presence. It's almost possible to feel him in the background of each scene (that he's not in), working his way to finding and taking down Dom's Ten.He also gets an awesome fight scene with Vin which is the best fight scene in the franchised only matched by Vin and Jason statham's fight scene in furious 7. Without the Dwayne, I don't think Fast Five would have reached the astronomical heights that it managed to cross.Fast Five bounces around from action scene to action scene and in between these action scenes is where it fuses its great characters into its fairly entertaining story to deliver what I think is one of the most well-rounded packages of the entire franchise; it might even be the most well-rounded (at least so far). I mean, seriously, you got Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Tyrese, Ludicrous, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Gal Gadot, Tego Calderon, Don Omar, and Dwayne Johnson in the same movie; it's the Expendables of race car action movies. Fast Five also throws in a small bit of genuine emotion in one particular scene and it reminded me that this bonkers franchise is able to actually be sad from time to time. Who would've thunk it?The one thing that has always managed to stick around in my brain since seeing Fast Five for the first time, and what has become my group's tradition since then, is picking characters from the movie that we 'represent'. I, of course, picked Dom because I'm the leader of our group. My closest friend picked Brian, my other friend picked Han because he's cooler than the rest of us, and so on and so forth. Since the Fast and the Furious series has always been about family/friendship, I believe that us choosing the characters like we did gave us a stronger connection to the movie but also a stronger connection to each other; this was the movie that evolved the friendship of my group into a small family that ultimately changed us all forever.There's nothing stronger than the bond of family, and Fast Five really embraces that concept until it runs out of fuel and plummets off a cliff and into the waters below. It is also a life-changing movie and a damn fine example of how to mix action, characters, and emotion into one rollicking good package.",10,2,3,7 April 2015
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," By far the best and darkest of all Star Wars films
","When we all sat down to watch 'The Empire Strikes Back' for the first we figured we knew what would happen in the rest of the trilogy. At the end of the second film we assumed Darth Vader would beat Luke in a lightsaber duel and then at the end of the final film Luke would finally kill Darth Vader. But then in what is still one of the biggest one-two punches ever aimed at an audience Darth Vader cuts off Luke's right hand and stuns the audience with the revelation 'I am your father.' Suddenly the idea that Luke was going to kill Darth Vader went from absolute metaphysical certainty to something very much in doubt. The thought that it would be three years before we found out how this would play out drove us absolutely crazy (remember the wonderful speculation that Boba Fett was a clone of Obi- Wan?).I have to admit that I never really believed that George Lucas intended for Darth Vader to be Luke Skywalker's father from the very start. If he had then we would not have had that 'What I said was true...from a certain point of view' from Obi-Wan Kenobi in 'The Return of the Jedi' to explain the statement that Darth Vader killed Luke's father in the original 'Star Wars' (change the name all you want, it is still 'Star Wars' to me). But for a plot twist it certainly floored audiences. I went to the first showing the first day for all three 'Star Wars' movies and since my brother made the mistake of flipping through the comic book version and stumbling across the film's big revelation (which he immediately shared with me) I was not surprised at what happened. But I still remember the audience gasping twice when Luke lost his hand and Darth Vader said his big line.'The Empire Strikes Back' is far and away the best of the 'Star Wars' movies, whether you are talking the original three or all of the prequels as well. It is a very dark film in which things are constantly going wrong. Luke is attacked and almost killed by a snow monster, the base on Hoth is attacked and evacuated, the Millennium Falcon end up inside a giant worm, Luke abandons his training with Yoda too soon to help save his friends, Lando betrays Han who ends up a frozen statue, and then Luke loses his hand and learns the truth about daddy. The only real bright spot in the movie is when Leia and Han fall in love (the comic relief with C-3PO does not count) and even that ends on a major downer. There is nowhere to go but up at the end of this one and it is rather amazing how many people would go back repeatedly to see a movie whose idea of a happy ending is that nobody is dead yet.George Lucas again wrote the story but the script by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan brings the level of the dialogue up to a more adult level than the Saturday morning serial feel of the first film (ultimately, they might be the ones who most deserve the credit for making this the best 'Star Wars' film). Director Irvin Kershner draws stronger performances out of the entire cast, which is precisely why he was picked for the second film. The result is an much more ambitious film where the characters have more depth, helped by the dramatic turns at the end that up the ante considerably on the story. Luke Skywalker is no longer the fresh-faced kid he was when we first met him, having to grow up really fast because of what happens in this film. But when you get audiences to take a Muppet as seriously as we take Yoda, then you are really accomplishing something. Even after all this time this film still works.This movie also reflected a great leap forward in terms of the special effects that were the hallmark of the first film. When we saw 'Star Wars' one of the things we fell in love with what how far special effects had come since '2001: A Space Odyssey,' the obvious reference point in the field of science fiction films. But that was nothing compared to what Industrial Light and Magic came up with three years later in 'The Empire Strikes Back.' No wonder Lucas wanted to go back and fix some of the special effects shots in his first 'Star Wars' film, especially with the X-wing fighters in the final attack on the Death Star. Compare that with the chase of the Millennium Falcon through the asteroid field in this one, which gets outclassed three years later by the Rebel attack on the new Death Star in the final film.When it comes to the second in a film trilogy 'The Empire Strikes Back' is the standard by which such things are judged. Granted there are not many of them, but 'The Attack of the Clones,' 'The Matrix: Reloaded,' and even 'The Two Towers' do not rise to the challenge. Ironically, 'The Empire Strikes Back' was so good that it made it difficult for 'The Return of the Jedi' to be better, especially since the final film was going to be more upbeat (and that was before all those cute Ewoks showed up). When I think about walking out of a movie theater with the words 'To be continued' in my mind, this is the movie that epitomizes that thought.",10,1,2,4 August 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," A new classic that demands repeated viewings
","Flesh and metal collide in the part sequel, part reboot, post apocalyptic, no holds barred Mad Max: Fury Road. 70 year old director George Miller returns to the franchise he created, 30 years after the last outing. This time with Tom Hardy as Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa, two rebels trying to survive in a desert landscape of lost humanity.The plot is fairly simple, Furiosa abandons her duties and sets out to find her homeland, and take Immortal Joe's young brides with her. Joe of course sets out to stop her and Max is caught up in this battle. Charlize Theron is fantastic as Furiosa, with her artificial limb and war paint, determined to find her home and reunite with what's left of her family. Tom Hardy as Max is a man of few words, troubled by visions of past horrors. Both need to work together as they guide the fragile and beautiful brides of Joe to safety. The film has a core theme of feminist solidarity that balances well against the testosterone of Max, Immortal Joe and his War Boys. The performances from the two leads and their mutual respect is told mainly through actions rather than dialogue, exposition takes a back seat here.Unlike previous films in the series, the budget this time around of $150 million finally matches the ambitions and imagination of the director. The sheer originality on display is impressive. Stunning photography, high contrast, warm colour palette and smooth camera work draw you into the wild west wasteland. The jaw dropping carnage of the action scenes are indescribable, Fast & Furious is a walk in the park compared to this. You must see it to believe it, but even then you still ask yourself, 'Is this actually happening?' It has the right mix of CGI and real stunts that will make you think back to classics like James Cameron's Terminator 2. And it all looks awesome in 3D IMAX. The score by Tom Holkenborg (aka Junkie XL) is loud, heart pounding, epic and in sync with the bizarre but soon to be iconic flamethrower guitarist and tribal drummers who get their fair share of screen time.I highly recommend this film if for some strange reason you've been sitting on the fence. It's feral, dark, gritty, anarchic, surreal, just pure mayhem. Mad Max: Fury Road isn't just any action film, it's one that sits side by side with your favourite Hollywood blockbusters, a new classic that demands repeat viewings for it's visual triumphs and sonic assaults. Now if you excuse me, i'm off to watch it again!",10,3,17,30 May 2015
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Brilliant special effect - but what else?
","I was extremely disappointed with the latest Transformers movie. Granted, I didn't have much faith in it to begin with as the second one was also a major slope down from the first; however, I didn't think it would be this bad.OK, so the first thing I noticed was the mysterious disappearance of Megan Fox and the appearance of her replacement it seems Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, a British Victoria's Secret Model. Well, where did Megan Fox go?! The only explanation given is that she dumped Sam. There's no hint as to why, when, where etc. This really bothered me for some reason. I'm not a very big fan of Megan Fox but I felt that she played quite a large role in this franchise and I was disappointed that the producers messed with the flow of Transformers by replacing her. This was their first mistake.Secondly, if I'm perfectly honest I had no frickin' idea what the hay was going on for most of this movie. The first part was all about how sad Sam's life is and how he needs to get a grip, get a job and stop thinking about the decepticons. Whilst all the action is going on in this movie Sam and Carly's relationship unfolds and develops which is a bit distracting for the viewer as the story switches and merges plot lines. Sam is jealous of Carly's relationship with her new boss, a rich man (Patrick Dempsey), who buys her a car and then *shocker* her boss turns out to be in league with the Decepticons.There is a new bad guy: Sentinel Prime, who in my opinion just looks like a robotic ent. He was Optimus Primer's predecessor and was in charge of guarding the 'Pillars', but he secretly made a deal with Megatron and is now one of the bad guys. Using these Pillars the Decepticons want to set up a teleportation link bringing all the Decepticons to Earth, which has the resources they require. In my opinion this made the film look like a race between giant robots to find some sticks. Meanwhile, the Decepticons are murdering members of the US and Russian space missions to cover their traces, but of course, they're not very subtle about this. (Hint: man mysteriously flies out the window of a high storey building). The Decepticons threaten to wage war on Earth if the humans don't agree to exiling the Autobots, so of course, the humans pack off their only means of protection up in a space shuttle and shoot it into the sky. Then, after a bazillion fires, explosions, special effects, peace is restored - as expected.I don't know why but for some reason the only thing I could think of every time I saw Shia laBeouf was Even Stevens. I didn't feel this way during the other two movies so perhaps LaBeouf's acting had slipped back into old ways and he was reprising the role of Louis Stevens.What is quite cool is how they incorporate history into this movie by saying that the 'Space Race' of the Cold War between the USA and the USSR was caused because a Cybertronian spacecraft landed on the moon.Some people really liked this movie, but for the life of me I cannot figure out why. I guess the special effects are fantastic but it's effect is significantly lessened as there is no plot line to back it up. All in all I thought this movie was a bit of a mess. It lacked plot and detail that was needed and by the end of the movie I could see, hear and think was explosions, explosions, explosions. Thank god this is the last instalment so they can stop tarnishing the name Transformer oh wait that is what I would've said in 2011 but now we've got transformers age of extinction YAY!!!!

Jurassic Park," A film 65 million years in the making
","Most film fans will have one film that ignited their love of cinema. For many that movie experience will come at a young age and in a dark theatre where the large screen envelops you in a whole new world you never thought possible. For me, like many of my generation, that film was Jurassic Park. Of course I liked many movies before that point but it opened my eyes to the potential of the medium like no other film, before or since. Scorsese talks about the religious-like experience cinema can create in its audience and watching Spielberg's classic for the first time I can fully appreciate what he means. It instilled a sense of reverential awe in me and whilst I had witnessed fantastical places like Oz and Tatooine I had never truly been transported to a foreign world as I had with Jurassic Park.It's a hard film for me to talk about rationally. It holds such a special place in my heart that I will never be able to find fault with the film, so instead I'm just going to gush about the movie's many positive attributes. Attributes like the groundbreaking special effects. The film is always assured of its place as one of the great technical achievements in cinema. CGI had been used in films for many years before but never quite to the point that you believed wholeheartedly in the events and creatures on screen. It is remarkable to think how far computer graphics have come since 1993 yet the film still looks utterly convincing, even more so than both of its inferior sequels. I can only put this down to the seamless blending of effects from the use of CGI, model work and animatronics. The film constantly tricks the audience into believing the dinosaurs were real by having creatures the cast could directly interact with. Because CGI has become so advanced now filmmakers rarely rely on the other types of effects work yet without them Jurassic Park's major moments would never have worked as well. Just imagine the T-Rex scene with the children trapped in the car, it is frighteningly believable because the creature is really there. Much of the critical attention is given to the computer wizardry but for me Stan Winston and his team are just as crucial to the film's success.Whilst the story is little more than a reworking of Westworld it is still so taut and full of genuinely magical moments that any familiarity in its conceit is immaterial. I can think of no other film with quite so many memorable sequences. The movie is packed with them, big or small, from the reverberating cup of water to the first dinosaur reveal, it is a film that has created more indelible memories than most filmmakers achieve in their entire careers. The cast are, with the possible exception of Laura Dern, perfect for their respective roles. When you compare it to a lot of modern blockbusters the film is surprisingly small in scale. Sure, you've got giant prehistoric creatures stomping around but the film doesn't have a sprawling cast of characters and it has no end-of-the-world climax. Yet it is the narrow focus that makes it all the more effective. Each character is given time to develop and whilst they may fulfil defined roles in the story they do at least feel like real and believable people. Jurassic Park may be a theme park but the film is more than just a thrill ride as you feel emotionally invested in the characters and events on screen.I've waffled on and not even mentioned the brilliant score by John Williams (a score so amazing it still sounds fantastic when slowed down by 1000%) or the film's perfect balance between comedy and scares. The film is a masterclass in blockbuster filmmaking and a bona fide classic.",10,3,3,6 June 2015
Furious 7," The perfect send off for Paul
","'This time it ain't just about being fast.'I saw this film the day it came out but i thought i would review the previous fast and furious films first. James Wan, who is well known for directing horror films (The Conjuring and Saw), took over the seventh film in this franchise replacing Justin Lin who had been sitting on the director's chair since the third instalment. What I found most interesting about this franchise is that it didn't seem like it was going anywhere after its solid debut in 2001 since the first couple of sequels focused on different characters and story lines. Even when they got the entire cast back together in 2009 for the fourth film I didn't feel like it was anything special. I'd always mildly enjoyed the films, but it wasn't until Fast Five that I was really engaged with the series. Justin Lin may have not impressed me before, but when that film came out he decided to have fun with the overblown action scenes and audiences embraced it completely. We had the team reuniting together being chased by tanks and planes and pulling off nearly mission impossible tasks. My greatest concern for this film was that Wan wouldn't follow that basic formula that had elevated the franchise in the first place. But in an early scene in the film those fears were soon gone when Wan practically gives the audience a wink by having Brian (Walker) telling his son that 'cars don't fly' when he playfully throws a small toy car through the window. We were about to find out that that claim wasn't necessarily true because throughout this film we actually see several cars fly during the spectacular action scenes.By the end of Furious Six the franchise was tied perfectly together by uniting the events that took place in Tokyo during the third film with the present. In the fifth and sixth instalments Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian (Paul Walker), Tej (Ludacirs), and Roman (Tyrese Gibson) had finally found financial stability and cleaned their names to return home. The character of Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) had helped reinvigorate the franchise and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) was brought back from the dead (well actually she never really died, but fans of the franchise know what I mean). Mia (Jordan Brewster) and Brian were enjoying their newfound family life, but as we found out in the end of the sixth film, Owen's brother Deckard (Jason Statham) was set on avenging him. Their seemingly peaceful life is interrupted as the team begins to be hunted down by this dangerous British criminal. Loretto is offered the opportunity to flip the papers on Deckard from being hunted to becoming the hunters when a secret government official known as Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) offers him a deal. A Somalian mercenary (Djimon Hounsou) has kidnapped a hacker known as Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) who has developed a computer program known as God's Eye that basically allows you to find anyone across the globe in a matter of seconds. If Toretto's team can rescue Ramsey and retrieve God's Eye he will let them use it to track down Deckard and catch him off guard. And so the adventure across the globe begins with flying cars, helicopters and droids exploding across the mountains of the Middle East, the elegant buildings in Abu Dhabi, and the city of Los Angeles.Gisele and Han were part of the reason why I enjoyed the previous films so much so I was worried that their absence in this film would hurt the movie, but the addition of Jason Statham as the main villain of the film elevated this to a higher level. There are great fight scenes between him and Dwayne Johnson and then with Vin Diesel that were incredibly entertaining. These are probably the best action stars of our generation and when the fighting choreography is filmed correctly you can't go wrong with these guys. There are also some fantastic action scenes involving fast car chases across a gorgeous mountain that ends in a Jurassic Park like cliffhanger. The action scenes are overblown, but that is what makes them so entertaining once you learn to accept the absurdity of it all and simply enjoy the ride. Over-the-top action scenes is what elevated this franchise in the first place and Furious 7 continues to play with that same premise taking advantage of Wan's knowledgeable work behind the camera and his use of different camera angles which makes the film look all the more entertaining.The greatest success of Furious 7 is being able to blend the incredibly fun action scenes with the dramatic elements involving the chemistry between the characters. We've grown to love these characters and each new addition always seems to work. Furious 7 takes some common themes from films like Mission Impossible or Ocean's Eleven and applies them really well here. Tyrese Gibson plays a similar character to the one Matt Damon played in Ocean's where he wants to prove his leadership qualities to the rest of the crew. There are elements recycled from other action films, but thanks to the cast it works extremely well in this franchise. And then you have the emotional aspect of this film surrounding Paul Walker's untimely death. You can't help but feel emotionally engaged towards his character knowing that the actor has recently passed away. There are several scenes of his face where the CGI seems evident, but the voice work was perfectly executed. The CGI never distracted me however, and I'm glad they decided to continue with the production of the film. The last five minutes are emotionally engaging and without spoiling the film all I can say is that the crew did him justice with a beautiful tribute. Furious 7 continues to build on an already engrossing franchise and it might just be my second favourite after Fast Five.",9,1,3,9 April 2015
