The Ring," It's nice to be scared again..
","This movie actually made me jump  I usually don't jump during a horror movie.  I have been watching them since I was little, and they never jumped. So back to 'The Ring', the previews looked like it would be a good movie, and everyone said it was scary, and boy were they right.  This movie had quite a few big jumps in it.  I suggest you don't see it alone, and see it before it goes out of theatres so you can have the full effect.",10,0,0,18 November 2002
Coyote Ugly," Excellent!
","I really didn't think this movie would be that good, but I was wrong.  It ended up being very good, and they staged some very great dance scenes. Piper Perabo really got into her role.  Everyone should see this.My Score: 9/10",Null,0,0,16 March 2002
Scream," If your looking for a comedy...
","If your looking for a comedy see this movie, but if you want to see something scary avoid this movie.  Courtney Cox gave a great performence as Gale Weathers, Drew was also great.  I would haved liked to maybe have seen Drew in the lead, I think that would have made it a little better, or maybe Charisma Carpenter, Neve I didn't care for in the first one, though she was great in the 2nd.  If you do want to have a little chill in your spine see the 2nd, it does have a little more thrills.  All in all Scream was ok. My score:  3 out of 5",2,3,10,2 March 2002
The Sixth Sense," Awful.
","I really expected something from this movie.  It seemed so good.  Well, so I rented it and I thought it was so bad!  The kid was especially annoying in this.  Bruce Willis though did give a great performance.  The only thing I liked was the twist ending.My score: 1.5 out of 5",2,1,3,10 March 2002
