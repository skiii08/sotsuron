Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Commercial as it can get
","Well, Mr. Lucas,your very first 'Star Wars' movie, meaning Episode IV, was a work of fantasy. Your current one is a work for money. I don't know if including a character only to make a movie more family suitable would have been in the intentions 20 years ago. But well, the direction you are steering at is clear since 'Return of the Jedi.' Question is now: how far will the fans let you go before you destroy the myth of 'Star Wars'? And one more question: could todays Lucas still do a movie like 'American Graffiti'? Probably not without having one of the protagonists constantly dining at a 'Burger King.'May the myth come back to you.",Null,0,1,9 September 1999
Armageddon," A physical and artistical joke
","If the American flag would have been on the payroll of this movie, it would have probably gotten more money than Bruce Willis himself; in every third scene or so it sure is to pop up. Oh yes, our American, down to earth boys are going to save the world, who else? The wipeout of a city like Paris is only good for a nice FX and that it might be useful to get help from the rest of the world never occurs to the NASA scientists. Well, if you've seen 'Deep Impact' you know the drift.Then let's talk about physics - the way it is treated in this movie would make Mr. Newton spin in his grave. Gravity on an asteroid the size of Texas? And apparently just as much as on earth, the way the protagonists moved? Well, to get that going the asteroid would have to have the weight of Earth on as much room as Texas has. The density would be so high that no matter if you used a 10000 watt drill or a toothpick to dig a hole the result would be the same. But somehow the gravity also seemed to fade out on story-line convenience, when one of the landing vehicles is able to drift over a wide valley on the asteroid by a little thrust of its boosters. We are not even talking about 'why' these vehicles were armed with heavy guns.Now about the actors: Liv Tyler is a fine young woman, although not a fine young actress. Bruce Willis as her father is like Arnold Schwarzenegger as Ghandi. Overall the entire cast seemed to not really know what they actually should be portraying, so the fault might not be on the actors, but on the bad storyline.If this movie would not pretend that it has to be taken serious, you could actually enjoy it - as a movie rental for a boring Saturday night. But if you are into patriotism go for it, anyway.",2,0,1,16 January 2000
Saving Private Ryan," Self-medication, Mr. Spielberg?
","This movie serves two purposes: a) glorify the American soldier from World War II and the American nation in general and b) help Mr. Spielberg overcome his own neurosis about being Jewish, a task he started with 'Schindler's List.' That probably makes him the envy of anyone who ever saw a psychologist: to get paid for spreading out your psyche instead of having to pay for it.The first 20 minutes of this movie are amazing, indeed. Very well captured is the sheer horror of landing on a fortified beach; the disorientation, the killing etc. But after that, this movie drops on the level of 'Armageddon': a mother has a number of sons, all of them died during the war, except one and the US military surely puts the life of half a dozen soldiers into peril to save that last one. Of course, that is completely logical.
The German soldiers, in the contrary, don't seem to have mothers or anyone who cares about them, they are ugly, lean-mean-killing machines, shouting incomprehensible things and should be killed wherever possible. They are also not just as scared as any other simple soldier on a battle field, they don't have any feelings at all. So, what could have been a great movie, with all the money spent for and stars on it, playing in the same league as 'All quiet on the Western Front' gets to be completely pathetic, unrealistic, super-patriotic and one-sided. Steven Spielberg once said that he often didn't feel he was a 'real' American and was left-out because of him being Jewish and that the past of his family haunts him. It is ok to feel that way and I wish him he will finally get rid of both feelings. But on the other hand he also was left out of getting an 'Oscar' until 'Schindler's List.' That was a well done movie, but on the long run it seems it didn't do Spielberg too good. Somewhere he must have come to the conclusion that doing movies about WWII helps him overcome his problems and making them patriotic will help him getting an Oscar.If you are interested in a realistic look on war, watch 'All quiet on the Western Front' or 'Das Boot.'",1,92,209,9 July 2000
Titanic," Bravo to the ship & farewell to the main actors
","This was clearly a carefully done Titanic movie when we only talk about the ship: almost all technical details of the Titanic were perfectly done, including the way she possibly sunk. I just wish Cameron wouldn't have given in to the studio and have a soap-like story wrapped around the ship, and even worse, have the two main characters in it played by two shallow actors, who were clearly beyond their skills. Or to say it differently: bad main actors in bad roles gave the movie a perfect teenie audience but had the actual main factor of the movie lost: the ship.",5,3,5,5 July 1999
The Green Mile," Politically correct nothingness
","'The Green Mile' tries hard to be a nice movie, to steer your emotions, to feel along. Etc. Everybody who is nice simply is nice, character depth is secondary. What completely ridicules the entire thing is the influence of fantasy elements to enlighten the atmosphere. Not only is everybody nice, but heah, with some special abilities they are even nicer!
Technically the movie is of course well done. Camera, lights, everything is in the green. Unfortunately that doesn't make a good movie, when characters are simply created to fulfill general expectations. Although this simply seems to be a routine production to appeal to mass audiences, anyway, and of course it hits right on the target. That Hanks was in for a role here is understandable - his main aim nowaday seems to be building up his reputation with the Academy. For Duncan the decision was probably more difficult, he got to play the usual part of the black country guy. But a chance to get a role in a 'made to please the academy' film is a hard thing to refuse, esp. when your co-star is Hanks and a name like Stephen King stands for the novel.It is much more reccomendable to watch 'Dead Man Walking' for a good look on the topic, but of course if you felt along with the characters in Cameron's 'Titanic' this is your thing to go for.",3,5,13,21 April 2000
Before Sunrise," Quite moving
","'Before Sunrise' left me with the feeling of 'I'd really like to know if they met again.' And my personal pessimism of course says they didn't. Okay, just my own life experience. But on the other hand the ending leaves room for imagination, so pick your own choice. The ending and actually the whole movie is unusual for an American made production and this courage should be honored. The actors were overall convincing, the camera staying realistic, not too much softtoning of a not so soft Vienna. I especially liked the look back in the morning on the places the two visited and the feeling of emptiness, at least for me, that now vibrated from them. Quite a fresh breeze after having watched kitsched romanticism in movies like 'Titanic.'",9,1,3,17 March 2000
The Sixth Sense," Illogic and constructed
","Whew, with the hype that went around this movie, you got the feeling that you miss out on elemental cinematic history if you don't see it. Unfortunately, that's not true. 'The Sixth Sense' tries hard to be a good psycho-thriller and in fact the idea behind it was good. But as the script was written, someone must have had the idea to put the real big bang in there, something no viewer can guess to happen, the totally total of all story twists there ever were. But, bad luck, the grand idea has to fit into the rest of the script, so you have to modify it and make compromises. And really, I was disappointed with the end. Not because of it, but because everything else was set up for it. I didn't guess the twist because it was so sneaky, but because it was completely implausible. To clarify that I will try hard not to give anything away, in case you didn't see 'Sixth Sense' yet, so I will ask only one question, which you'll understand later: how do you get into someones apartment without ringing the doorbell or knocking? There are numerous more points like that but by stating them I would give away the surprise. It's too bad the whole film had to suffer just to get that in.And then there are horror scenes, not too many, but I guess the writers figured that the movie had to give some more than the general idea and the last big bang. And again, they just serve the purpose and are badly integrated: young Cole, they boy who can see ghosts, later finds out that they want him to help them. I think even a ghost can anticipate that scaring someone to death isn't a good start for getting help.Probably the best asset of the movie is Haley Joel Osment, who played 'Cole.' Marvelous what this young boy could do with his role. Bruce Willis stays a little unbelievable as a psychologist, but that could be the script as well. So far I yet have to encounter a psychologist who handles therapy that way. Well, nice idea, nice movie, but nothing overly sensational. Horror movies greatly benefit from taking part in our world and incorporating the horror into it. But then they have to stay true to rules we all are familiar with and to those they need to set up to make us bite our nails. If 'Sixth Sense' would have mastered both, I'd be yelling 'great one!'",2,1,2,9 July 2000
Rear Window," A great thriller
","Hitchcock clearly was a master with his tools. I would dare to say it is unlikely that many directors could do the same with the boundaries the script set - an apartment and a number of windows to be looked at. Who didn't feel along with the main actor and his boredom, staring at other peoples lives and the sudden thrill and danger he gets entangled in?",10,0,2,13 January 2000
The Truman Show," A great idea for a movie by itself
","I am not sure how many of us can really appreciate the thought of how close we actually are to a 'Truman Show.' In the Netherlands there are a number of people locked into a large apartment, which actually is a studio. The last one to remain in there receives a certain amount of money. The whole studio is full of tiny cameras, even in the bathrooms. To have at least a small amount of privacy, those people hung up a towel in the shower, at an angle where no camera can watch. This show is called 'The Big Brother Show' - think about it.Peter Weir did some fine directing here and even Carrey goes beyond what we know from him. The sarcasm in it all could have been taken even a notch further, but the overall outcome is still remarkable. A definite not-to-be-missed movie!",7,0,0,16 January 2000
The Matrix," All tricks, story not original
","Great FX, but the so much hyped about story has been adapted better in other movies. The main actor does what he usually does: portray his one facial expression. The first half of the movie is completely boring, the second half can't live up to the expectations.",8,1,2,13 January 2000
