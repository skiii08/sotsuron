The Blair Witch Project," Original concept and real horror experience
","It started like a common teen attempt to make a project about one of the old legends,but it turns from the entertaining trip into their worst nightmare. From the start till the end it keep viewer in tension and that's what every good horror movie need. We really liked that spooky-forest background and all of that American atmosphere. We found ourselves feel the pain of the characters sometimes. It reminds us same concept series about the Slenderman called Entry.In our horror marathon it was one of the best movie we have seen yet, so we really recommend it for you guys.",9,1,3,9 June 2017
The Others," Classic disturbing movie with unexpected ending
","It started like a classic family movie, you watch at rainy evenings, but it started growing with a creepy-disturbing atmosphere. In this horror movie do not expect a lot of jump-scares or gore scenes,but every scary part was worth it. We recommend this movie to everyone, who is looking for ghostly-eerie movie and wants to have a good feeling after it. We really enjoyed it, but the beginning of movie wasn't as we expect, it started really slowly.",7,0,0,9 June 2017
Halloween," Classic American horror movie
","We loved that concept of that Halloween night. The music in this movie was really, really good and enjoyable, like we rate the music 10/10. Movie do not have a lot of jumpscares or gore scenes, what is a pity, but as slasher it has great frightening atmosphere. We are really excited for the next episodes, and we hope it will be good as this one.",8,0,0,4 July 2017
