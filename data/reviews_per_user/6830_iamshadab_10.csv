The Avengers," Expectations were too high, but what I found is Hilarious
","When we are about to see a movie which has a superhero, we automatically associate our expectations, but this time we've got six of them... So its obvious to expect things from it. So this time, they have changed the rule book. They concentrated on other factors that affects, and this time they came up with giving it a comic appearance than comics, and boy, they came out as winners, I didn't remembered any other Hollywood movie I laughed out so much and the good thing is its a movie you can enjoy with your family as there are no or negligible vulgarities into it.The movie takes it to the next level of movie making with superheroes. The Autopsy of movie will destroy your will to read this review, my verdict is don't miss it, its an adventure of a lifetime....",10,1,4,4 May 2012
The Hunger Games," Yet Another Step towards a dumber world
","I saw the movie, and found it crap, if IMDb permitted me to review in less than 10 lines, my review is over, but fate.So if you ask me why am I writing this review, than the point is that I didn't came out of the mental; tortures of the twilight series, watched every movie with an expectation that this one will be better, but it only proved that previous one was not bad. Book series can't always supposed to be as good as Harry Potter, no offense to book fans, the book is good, but not supposed to be a movie and if you do this, the results are disastrous, and moreover, the ratings of the movie are approving this dumbness. But what to expect in a generation of Justin Beiber and Twilight series to be happening... Sorry folks but nothing to read in the review, nothing in the movie also.",3,31,43,5 April 2012
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spider-man Comes Home
","Since it's a reboot, we already know the story of how spider-man gets its power, thus this was a move that the time can be used in the formation of plot. Second clever move was a young spider-man. The movie is all about a school going superhero as suggested by the name. The limits of spider-man are observed for the first time and why is he considered an underdog in the MCU is also reasoned in the movie. As I say how Hollywood is getting more mature every-day can be scene that the emphasis was not on a VFX treat but on the story, Tom Holland as a learning spider-man was brilliant. There limited space for Michael Keaton and he justified it.",9,1,5,19 July 2017
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," This time, cap has gone way far...
","First of all, its the best overall entertainer movie this year to date. Now to begin with story, if someone narrate it verbally to you, you might find it childish and funny, but well build script, packed with all the action that is required. Coz when we talk about Cap'n America, there are no super powers in him, that limits the writers from thinking super powers. It's a Super hero limited with resources, and the challenge was to beautifully taken and furthermore, tighter Direction and well timed acting of whole team, and the special effects team. Together they have served a wonderful movie that would be a new benchmark for Superhero movies.The Action of the movie is also another reason one should see the movie, and my favorite was the starting ship sequence.Whole movie is like a thrill ride and the first half keeps your mind so uncomfortable that what is it going on ? and makes you stick to your seat while not to miss any part of it. the 3D version is average and is okay to watch it in 2D.Final words... If you are a fan of The Avengers series, this is something you should not miss....",10,1,2,21 April 2014
Doctor Strange," Spellbound......
","When you go to a movie with the sky high expectations, and you get multiverse, multi-dimensions. Yes you get that.The Animators and visuals are so great enough to get the Oscar of this year, (specially the multiverse journey of strange, I wish that just not to stop) you can quote my words, so if you haven't watched it yet, I'd suggest you to go to an IMAX, or the best projection available in your place.Out of all the versions of Doctor Strange you know, this one is a conqueror of all, but then, the story telling lacks the bit about how this all is happening, Benedict Cumberbatch, you indeed did your homework very well, and somehow the character Doctor Strange has needed the same proudy self centered like Sherlock.And for the MCU, you are making us more and more curious to your work by making our expectations grow more just because they get fulfilled every next time.",8,2,5,7 November 2016
X-Men: Apocalypse," Imbalanced...
","First things first, movie is good, but there's a lot more that could've been better, like they can link the movie with X MEN Origins: Wolverine, as there is a sequence where it feels connected but not the way it should, the story, well every comic fan knows what and who apocalypse is, but his get-up and make-up was awful, and people who are not familiar with comics will definitely don't feel connected to the story.Psiloc has finally mad her debut in the series, and she is how she was in the comics (only thing that relieved in the movie to see her that way)but still her character and her powers needed explanation too, she's probably one of the influential mutant but they just avoided her may be due to the whip which makes her similar to Wonder-Woman.The movie has became more of a special effects treat rather than a complete package, although there are elements which you'd like too, this movie is made for Magneto, or naming it X MEN:Magneto will not be a bad idea, and yes, you must watch it if you are a fan of him... And here I'm talking about the good Magneto, not much here for fans of wolverine rather than just cameo...Verdict : Watch it only if you are fan of XMEN series, else there's not much for a average movie goer....",6,1,8,28 May 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Missing Sam Raimi all the way....
","Being a huge fan of Spiderman, went to watch it First Day First Show and being among the first to be disappointed by the flick, there are lots of drawbacks that were making me feel 'wait... what ???' and thus the film goes and the way this loosely bounded script can not be resulted in a better movie, coz seriously, the making of max as 'Electro' is not as justified as the villains in previous Spiderman movies had, it all looks like a mess, the only thing that one can enjoy in the movie are some action sequences among the movie, beyond that, a few humorous jokes are good too, but you'll be disappointed if you look for a story in the movie. If you talk about the acting, the best one was Jamie Foxx as 'Electro' , as he justifies the need of the character which was still misguided in the script, he should be pity and it makes you feel too, Emma stone as Gwen Stacy was good too, but yes Andrew Garfield, you disappointed a little bit.If someone ask me for an Amazing Spiderman 3, I'll not be going with Mark Webb as a choice for that, we want our Great Sam Raimi back as the Spiderman maker...In the end, it's better to wait for a DVD released version and watch at home unless you only want it to look for its special effects on big screen....",4,8,18,3 May 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Iron Man steals the show...
","Yes ! Expectations were way too high, being fortunate that it released in India among selected countries, a week earlier than the rest. thanks to the distribution houses. The Marvel-Disney joined together will rule the superhero industry has been proved again. It's obvious to compare a sequel from the last one. So this time, the movie is less comic, and more action, lots of action. And this time, the team has grown bigger than the last one, the only problem is next time, the justification of screen appearance.The script writers have totally justified the story about what kind of super-villain will they need, although there were stuff you want to know how it happened but the pace of the movie doesn't gives you the chance to sink in the think,Iron man, stood as the captain of the team, so yes he is everywhere in the movie, Hulk and Bruce, both of them gave a noticeable part, and as usual. You do miss Nick fury and SHIELD in this one. Thor was there and Captain America was negligible for me. Only there for killing and action,Quicksilver not as enjoyable as X-Men: Days of the future past, and Scarlett witch was superb.So the question is, as I said in the start, expectations were too high, so does it meet the expectation...?Definitely, make sure not to miss this one....",9,1,6,24 April 2015
Avatar," Thank God, It ended,
","This movie is meant for those who love to see without using brain and heart, You'll ask yourself 'Is it the same Cameroon, whom we know???'and most of all, the story deals with, not another planet yet an Indian Tribal Village, and that what they call 'Navi' are the Naxalists of it, for those who don't know, are some sort of terrorist, what takes a revolutionist kind of approach to make it happen, so nothing new for me in the story, So can say Cameroon to plagiarize it ??The 2 score is only given to the feel what sometimes occurs to see the jungle,Nothing else....",2,5,11,10 February 2010
Joker," What he did was wrong, but was it the right thing to do at the moment ?
","The creative liberty given to the director/writers has given a new blend on the way you look at the joker. You don't need to be a fan of DC and/or the joker to engulf in to this epic saga of the journey of a transformation of a character. Every moment you have sympathy with the protagonist, he outsmarts you and surprises with the next move. The cringe it creates what happens next and results in another fiasco.All the time you ask yourself what he did was wrong, but was it the right thing to do at the moment ?
The so cleverly written movie was very well crafted and Joaquin Phoenix deserves all the respect on impersonating the soul of the character, Todd Phillip from his history of making movies has totally changed, He has become joined the big boys league now.
It would be a sin here not to mention clockwork orange and how someone is forcefully made into something, although joker here was more forced by the society.
And finally, Heath Ledger, the joker from the dark Knight, this was how a psychotic mind like him will become after few years past. Saying which one was better is a bad comparison to make. But with all respects to heath ledger, Joaquin Phoenix faced the gradient of character, which gives him the lead.",10,2,3,9 November 2019
