The Ring," Delightfully creepy and basically wrong
","This movie should be put under the title of horror, but more one of Terror. The Ring contains very little gore, and apart from a couple of scenes (bath suicide, death of Samara) there is little violence. The film wins by having images which are 'wrong' from the girl in the closet at the beginning with the horribly contorted face, its not bloody but just 'not right', difficult to look at, easy to remember. The same with Samara emerging from the TV and doing 'that walk'.In agreement with the other user comment this does seem to be a movie about settling disgruntled spirits, however in difference the characters fail to do so. The films heroine does link the clues, and visits the resting place of the demon, however she realises that nobody can calm her, and even after trying to bargain with the dead, they still come for our souls, there is nothing anybody can do to escape.",9,0,2,21 March 2005
