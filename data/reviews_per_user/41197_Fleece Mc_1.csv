The Blair Witch Project," BWP - the most interesting film of the year
","Actually i have seen BWP twice. First in the original version, and then in german. How can a film, that is supposed to look like a documentary, be dubbed? The german version is not scary at all. You don't believe for one secund, that it might be true. The original version of this film is amazing. If i hadn't known that it is a fake, i surely would have believed it's true. (I only wondered how the camera-akkus could last that long.) However. BWP is one of those films where everybody cries: Why didn't i have this great idea? This Film is absolutely brilliant in my eyes.",10,1,2,28 March 2000
