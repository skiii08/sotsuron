Hereditary," All hype
","By no means the worst film I've ever seen, but leagues away from the best. Long-winded, dull, largely uneventful, and an ending that made my toes curl with embarrassment. Seriously, what was THAT all about? The only redeeming thing is the acting, which was outstanding. Couldn't rescue the banal clichÃ©-ridden plot though. A real shame.",3,1,4,4 July 2018
Incredibles 2," Intelligence-insulting inane dross
","So the underlying premise of this is that the tech / inventor is bad and the marketing / ad is the innocent duped by the evil genius. Okaaay. Think about that for a second. Add in some preachy moralising and hackneyed gender role reversal, along with blink-and-you-miss-it plot lines and you've got yourself a formulaic franchise sequel for attention-deficit morons. Avoid. It's depressingly unimaginative, borderline subliminal brainwashing drivel.",1,21,37,18 November 2018
