Catch Me If You Can," not the most dynamic movie of the season *spoilers*
","'Catch me if You Can' though not the most dynamic movie of the year, is definately one of the better movies I have seen for some time.  It lacks the grandeur and stunning sights of 'Towers' and Gangs' and therefore relies on the basics of moviemaking...good direction, acting, and a good story. And Speilberg doesn't fail in delivering a movie to keep you entertained for two and a half hours. However, when looking at the movie in parts, the audience is left wanting something a bit more.  DeCaprio fails to convince that he is a young boy who is running away, not from the feds, but from the failed relationship of his parents.And when he reached the point where he can no longer live in denial, you don't really feel for him.  Nor does Hanks quite earn your sympathy when he continually just misses catching DeCaprio. On the other hand, Walken manages to stir your emotions with his wonderful delivery as DeCaprio's father. Towards the end, Spielberg fails to wrap everything up as neatly as you would want.  Nevertheless, it is a movie worth seeing at least once.  It was good fun that will possibly be lost in the deeper movies and more cinematic movies of the season.  But if you aren't in the mood to see an epic film or left wondering just what the movie was about, I recommend catching the flick when you have nothing better to do on a cold afternoon.",7,0,0,26 December 2002
