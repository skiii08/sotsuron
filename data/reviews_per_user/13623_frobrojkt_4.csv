First Man," Kinda a mess, nothing compared to Apollo 13
","What a disappointment. First Man leaves everything to be desired. It feels more like a slanderous misrepresentation of an American hero than a documentary. What was first man attempting to accomplish ?
First Man is a disjointed mess with no clear objective other than to prove to the world that no one is perfect. Apparently you cannot be an American hero and loving spouce and parent at the same time.People who will be interested enough to see this movie will likely fit into two categories. First they are fans of the 'space race' and they space program in general. If you (like me) fit into this category, save your time and money. Do not see this film. It is grossly inaccurate in its depictions of real people. Such as the embarrassing, factless depiction of Buzz Aldrin. And on top of the people it misrepresents, it spends too little time on the actual 'space race' stuff.The second category of people who will want to see this film are likely fans of the director. Those people may also be disappointed as it does not deliver in its performances, writing, and drama. This is no Whiplash.The only genuinely good thing I can give this film is the cinematography. Beautifuly shot, however the handheld aspect gets kinda old.",5,5,8,1 February 2019
Aquaman," James Wan... I'm sorry.
","First I would like to preface this review by stating that I am a big James wan fan!! His directing style and talent are unparalleled in the horror genre.. but even a director as talented as Wan couldn't save this train wreck of a film.I could go on and on about everything wrong with this film, but that would literally take up the complete running time of the movie. So instead to save all readers and potential viewers the trouble I will include the aspects that were .. ok.The trench creatures!! Awesome !! Best scene of the movie visually, acted and directed!! (Don't worry, No spoilers here because this scene is in the trailers) this is the only scene where I felt James Wan's talent and horror flare showed through!! The creature design was incredible!!But aside from that one scene (literally 5 min of the entire movie) there was nothing that could save this disaster.Please, if you value your time or the time of others.. DO NOT go see this film!! Wait for the movie to go to Redbox and rent it for $1.75 so you can skip forward to the trench scene. Honestly $1.75 is a steep price to pay considering the trash you are about to wade through.. but hey, it's your time spent.. I have already wasted mine.",4,2,5,3 January 2019
Aladdin," Another shameless money grab by Disney
","I must admit I didn't have high hopes from the beginning, but i still tried to be optimistic given the director.The acting is terrible on the part of basically every character. Unfortunately, this even includes the performances by actors who can actually act as well as those without the higher expectations. The best acting in the whole film was courtesy of the magic carpet which happened to also be completely CGI, and had no speaking lines.The casting itself just seemed completely wrong. Will smith could have been a good genie, if he was allowed to be himself. Instead the writing and directing seemed to dictate that he attempt to replicate robin williams. Aladdin and jasmine were ok as far as looks go, but again the acting was so abysmal that any casting points earned were omitted. Finally, Jafar was perhaps the worst cast character in the entire film.Anyway, my opinion is that this dreadful film was merely a shameless money grab by Disney. Aladdin has more resemblance to a badly filmed stage play than to the original Disney cartoon from whence it came.",4,27,47,27 May 2019
Midway," One of the most visually spectacular films of the year!
","Midway absolutely delivers with its visual recreation of the battle of midway and several of the battles leading up to it.
The acting for the most part is spot on! The more well known actors like Dennis Quade and Woody Harrilson (probably spelled wrong) put fort a flawless performance. While even the lesser known actors do a pretty good job. Only a few poorly delivered lines out of the whole 2 hour + running time.
Based off of the limited research I did prior to seeing the film and what I knew previously, Midway gives a extremely accurate depiction of the battle. As well as the details of the war behind the scenes on both sides. My feeling is that it this film did quite well accurately describing the war from both the US and Japanese military. The film obviously has a American spin on the story, but I really appreciated how humanizing it is to both sides of the war. This is NOT an American military propaganda film.
All in all a solid film, however it's running time seems a little excessive. If they wanted to put that much detail into this, I would've loved to see this as a miniseries as opposed to a 2h+ film.
I hope there will be more films like this to come.",8,1,2,27 November 2019
