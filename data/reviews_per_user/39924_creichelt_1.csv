Raiders of the Lost Ark," do some digging
","'Raiders of the Lost Ark' truly is a masterpiece. Even after watching it over and over again, you can still find something that you haven't recognized before. In addition to finding something new every time you watch it, the things you have already seen never get old. Who didn't want to have a bull-whip when they first saw the movie? Who didn't dream of exploring ancient ruins, dodging vicious traps, and fighting the 'bad guys' when they were young. Who didn't want to become an archaeologist after seeing Professor Jones in action? Watching Indiana Jones, takes you back to the good old days (1981), when archaeology professors were still real men, when cute petite brunettes could still take any man in a drinking game, and when special effects were still handmade. I have to say it really hasn't lost its appeal; it rather grows on me every time I see it.So what are you waiting for? Get off the computer and experience the thrill. Grab your fedora hat and bull-whip, go outside, find something buried in your backyard, and escape all kinds of tricky situations. Or just watch 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and see a pro do it.",10,2,4,27 November 2006
