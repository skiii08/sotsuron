The New World," Was not impressed
","Just wasn't my kind of movie. Really was mislead in the trailers and advertising. I just wish Hollywood would tell the truth instead of finding out most of the movie was background thoughts. Those that like that kind of movie can make their decision.There were a few decent scenes but for the most part told the story in the background talking, not dialog. Too many scenes went on for far too long with nothing said.At the end of the movie, most of the entire theater stayed seated and after a moment you could hear boos, 'what was that', laughing and general talking of dissatisfaction.I think movies like this and Brokeback Mountain should be advertised for what they are. The New World was advertised more as a 1600 explorer and Indian action movie instead of the artistic thin red line movie that it was. Brokeback mountain was advertised as a romantic movie with the men and women in the trailers and not as the gay cowboy movie it really was. It is intentionally deceiving the paying public.A definite thumbs down.",2,2,7,27 January 2006
