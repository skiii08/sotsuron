The Monuments Men," Movie was so BAD that I had to make a Review...
","Well first of all, I have to say that I have been looking for a different World War 2 movie for a while and i thought this movie would be it...After seeing the trailer, for the first time, i also thought this was a good movie and it was worth watching, but i was wrong... This movie was so bad that i had to do my this review and here is why:There are so many plot wholes, time lapses, historical in inaccuracies, badly used props like different ranks in the same uniform, comedy in places where it shouldn't have, scenes that make no sense and plenty more... This movie must be the worst movie i haver saw, and i must tell you that i saw C and B grade Movies and even D grade Movies that were better in terms of plot, ambiance and scenes, but just didn't have this enormous budget like this movie did.I will write a little about the movie but not too much since its not needed to talk about something so bad...The movie starts, with a women that works in a Paris Museum, under the orders of a Nazi 'Doctor', the funny thing is there is so many wrong things with this that makes me laugh, first of all, this doctor has two or three different ranks in his uniforms, which makes this a terrible terrible mistake, then he knows that the brother of this woman is involved with the resistance and they attempted to capture some art that the Nazi stole, so he confronts the woman about it because he knew only her knew the details, but doesn't even kill her, even if that makes sense to you, then wait for the next scene were the Allies almost reached Paris and these 'Doctor' and the Nazis are on the run, and try to take the train with some art stolen, meanwhile the woman runs to a bridge and starts screaming ' i can see you' to the 'Doctor' he then starts shooting her with a pistol from long distance, while she stands still, even though he missed, for me this scene was a joke, that makes no sense. Along the movie, this woman had little to no substantial appearance and almost made no part of the movie, even though at the beginning the movie made us believe that she was important. After that scene the movie continues with the Monuments Men, which are some art curators that suddenly are lieutenants, colonel, and other ranks just because they can, they form up the team and after that, they decide to split up to some cities around Europe, to protect the most valuable pieces of art. So fast forwarding the movie, one of them went to protect the most valuable art the Madonna, and told the priests to block the door, and don't open it under any circumstances. The Germans, smart guys, brought someone wounded, and when the priests saw it, they opened the door, anyway, this 'Monument Men', was a sergeant at least (according to uniform) and the had surprise factor (hiding in a corner behind a wall), when the German office came close the American soldier shot him first, but even with all those conditions he shots the German in the arm, that was about 2 m from him, while the German shoots him twice right in the chest, even though the American was breeding, he doesn't even try or continue to shoot the German, and the Nazis walked away with the Madonna. The movie fast forwards a lot, doesn't even show how did they get there, in some scenes, and its all disconnected, even the Russians in the end appear to me happy to lose the art pieces to the Americans.Anyway, the movie was so bad, that it shouldn't even exist, don't waste any money on it, because its 2 hour long and its not even worth it...",3,2,2,6 January 2015
