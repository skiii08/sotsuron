The Blair Witch Project," Great Movie, if you are willing to pay attention!
","It really irritates me to read all these summaries trashing THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.  The people who write these reviews are the people who go into the movie excepting a slasher movie such as Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer, where you don't actually have to pay attention to the dialogue, you can just watch people get killed.  Furthermore, its hard to be scared in a crowded movie theater, especially if you go in there determined not to be scared.  SO FOR ALL YOU PEOPLE WHO ARE DEBATING WHETHER OR NOT TO SEE THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, IT IS A MUST SEE.  IF YOU ARE ACTUALLY WILLING TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE DIALOGUE(SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHATS HAPPENING) AND LET YOURSELF GET INTO IT, IT IS ACTUALLY VERY SCARY.  IT WILL GET TO LATER. DEFINITELY SEE THIS MOVIE!!!",10,1,2,19 August 1999
