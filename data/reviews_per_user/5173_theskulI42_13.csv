Changeling," Frustratingly one-dimensional morality play.
","Among the most popular types of shows on television are shows about forensic criminology. CSI and all its fictional brethren get the ratings, but for me, the cream of the crop is Forensic Files on the former CourtTV. Since they're relegated to the world of the real, outlandish stories are usually few and far between, and they aren't particularly adept at misdirection (the first person accused is almost never vindicated), and yet, I prefer it over similar shows thanks to excellent pace, presentation and personality, namely the startling delivery of narrator Peter Thomas, a man with a voice that could make children playing hopscotch terrifying. This show continually came to mind throughout the extensive length of Clint Eastwood's Changeling, a film that disappointingly lacks both ghostly red balls and Odo and the Founders.The film deals with a telephone operator in 1927 whose son goes missing, and is the victim of a police cover-up when they return a boy that isn't her own, and attempt to discredit her as crazy. When creating a film based upon a true story, you always run the risk that the story will be overly familiar to some audience members (I made it a point to avoid any and all details so as not to spoil it for myself), so, as stated, it comes down to pace, presentation and personality, and the film only partly succeeds. The opening jaunt through town in 1927 was wonderful in its feelings of the ordinary, the mundane; it's just life, and it was lovingly created. But this feeling quickly wore off, and the film soon became ordinary itself, the visuals becoming a drab non-issue. As for the other two P's, the film failed on all counts. Angelina Jolie turned on the wailing histrionics almost immediately, and her delivery and emotion ran false throughout (also, I was never, ever able to see the character, all I saw was Angelina). John Malkovich sleepwalked through his sparse character, with Jeffrey Donovan bringing up the abominable rear (the Lucky Charms leprechaun is a most believable Irish man).Pertaining to pace, one look at the film's length should tell you all you need to know. Eastwood gives it a sort of three-act structure, none of which ring anything but contrived. In the first, Jolie screams MY SON MY SON MY SON and all the one-dimensional villains scream YOU'RE CRAZY CRAZY CRAZY, in the second, it's the same story, except she's in a mental hospital. The third becomes a sort of double court drama, and features not only its one moment of intrigue, but exacerbates exactly why this film doesn't work as a whole. Eastwood's cowboy origins show through in the characterization, as not a single character in the entire film is given an even two-dimensional shade. Jolie is so idealized I'm surprised her character wasn't sacrificed so she could float to heaven. In her presence, every other character becomes undershown. Malkovich is but a plot machination to spring her from the pen, and S.S. Hahn breezes in, has a righteous, and did I mention pro bono shoutdown. On the flipside, Chief Davis and J.J. Jones are so single-mindedly ignorant that Bud White would have whipped their asses on the spot, and Gordon Northcott is so preposterously, snivelingly evil that I'm amazed they allowed him to avoid a lengthy mustache for him to twirl.Northcott's eventual denouement is all the more frustrating considering the film's one fleeting moment of worthwhile commentary: the convicted murderer's speech about how he had been railroaded, and never given a chance by a single person in the courtroom save for Jolie, who had never badmouthed him to the press, and never made any sort of announcement of judgment towards him. This comment made me confront my own feelings, as I too had convicted this man right off the bat, ignoring his every plea, rationalizing every claim he made as a falsehood, after having spent an entire film with a woman who was the victim of the exact same treatment. Unfortunately, this was but fleeting as the very next segment turns him into a blithely uncooperative kvetch, subsequently confirming his guilt in a scene so plainly obvious that it's not even treated as a surprise.Changeling seems to have inclinations to not only win a lot of Oscars (and don't think I didn't make a joke during the film's credits about how we should have gone to see It Happened One Night at the Royal instead), but to be mentioned in the same breath as other legendary neo-noirish looks at the seedy side of old Los Angeles like Chinatown and L.A. Confidential, but those films were brilliantly scripted, breathlessly paced, and had characters that, if perhaps leaning one way or another, were all real people with real feelings and real motivations, and despite the fact that Changeling is based on a true story, none of the characters ever rang true for more than a moment, and I was a step ahead at every opportunity. I can tear up at the drop of the hat, a sucker especially for court dramatics, but even Matthew Harrison Brady was a man first, and 'she wasn't thrown in, she was escorted'? Not even E.K. Hornbeck could be that heartless.{Grade: 5/10 (C) / #51 (of 80) of 2008}",5,12,23,9 November 2008
The Incredible Hulk," A gross overcorrection in tone provides the same result.
","Well, here we are, in possibly the most unique situation in film history: a film that is simultaneously a remake, a sequel, a new adaptation, an adaptation functioning as a sequel, a sequel functioning as a remake, and you could add the word 'pseudo' to everything in the paragraph.'The Incredible Hulk', as it stands, exists because of the film it precedes, Ang Lee's oft-criticized 'Hulk', a film that had the gall to take a comic book hero whose main characteristic is that he smashes things, and give him a backstory and character development, in an attempt to add some depth to the usual action movie histrionics. Unfortunately, he failed miserably, as there is both too much chatter and worse, almost all of it is the same sort of generic, familiar pap that all comic book films have. It wasn't any smarter or more intellectual than the other films of its ilk, it just wanted you to think it was because it treated what most entries use as montages as the main action, and the action scenes as short punctuation in between blocks of text.Needless to say, the mainstream, people who hate dialogue-heavy films when they DO possess intelligence and depth, hated this pseudo-intellectual, hideously over-directed nonsense, and Marvel realized if they wanted to continue, they were going to have to do a reboot. Unfortunately, when they rebooted, the filmmakers (and presumably their backers) panicked, and overcompensated the other way, removing any and all traces of character development, and merely making it a string of action sequences, with a bland throw-in romance that isn't developed past base. The opening sequence is actually surprisingly well-done, but once they begin to chase him, I felt my attention start to wane, and the film never regained the goodwill I felt for it early.In the acting department, Edward Norton is certainly a step up from Eric Bana, but he's given much of the same bland platitudes, without much of the overabundance of whining that Bana had to slog through, so really, although Bana's effect on me was certainly negative, it's more to speak of than Norton's effect on me, which was almost wholly negligible, because a good actor can only be a good actor if you actually give him worthwhile material, and it's just not here. Liv Tyler is just as much a useless wet blanket as Jennifer Connelly was half a decade ago, but Jennifer Connelly was far more attractive, so I guess that's a downgrade? Speaking of downgrades, the one person that really was fully-formed, refreshingly realistic and well-acted in 'Hulk' was Sam Elliott as General Ross. It was really neat to see him play someone who wasn't just the usual Military Man who is just constantly yelling to shoot clip after clip after clip into the hero, and it was too bad to see him get stuck in such a lame flick. Well, William Hurt takes over the role here, and sadly, he has been turned into exactly the sort of ineffectual, gung-ho, bullet-abuser that it was refreshing to see Elliott go away from, and he also fades without any impact. In supporting roles, Tim Roth and Tim Blake Nelson are solid in smaller roles, but other than a few choice lines here and there, aren't really given anything to really unleash a character from.The film's action climax and its extra final scene tie it inseparably with this spring's 'Iron Man', another film that was critically and commercially acclaimed, and underwhelmed me with its laziness and mediocrity. 'Iron Man', though, at least had a charismatic centerpiece character, and although I grew completely tired of his shtick by the end of that film, it was still a positive point to hang its hat on. This film has no such centerpiece, despite the presence of a better actor, and suffers for it.Also, the fact that that film had the same sort of 'gathering and joining up' final scene means without question that these are all leading up to a movie sometime in the future which may very well be the biggest comic book movie ever made. I can only hope that by then, they took the time to craft realistic, thought-out characters, an original storyline, and yet, still realize that at the end of the day, we'd all like, not just explosions, not just exposition, but a balanced diet of depth AND destruction, and when that happens, you'll have your comic book masterpiece, something that 'The Incredible Hulk' surely ain't.{Grade: 5/10 (C) / #45 (of 79) of 2008}",5,1,5,7 November 2008
Wanted," The Children of the Matrix and Coca-Cola
","Video games are fun. They're a fantasy as deep as fantasy can go; where films merely show you exciting and exotic professions, video games allow you the magic of interaction, involving you to the fullest level possible outside of actually doing it. With video games, you are given the chance to be a hit-man, a guitar hero, a superstar athlete, or the Chosen One, tasked with saving a fair maiden, or an entire world. Wanted has the DNA of a video game, but you have to sit and watch someone else play.Wanted is a film made by men who work tireless, empty office jobs, watch Fight Club and Office Space, and fantasize about emulating Edward Norton and Ron Livingston. These are white men who have a DVD collection full of action movies, including perhaps Gone in 60 Seconds (the remake), and all three Matrix films (ESPECIALLY those), and have an extensive video game collection, including Grand Theft Auto, Burnout, The Legend of Zelda and Max Payne. These are men who enjoy intense, industrial and rap-metal, Nine Inch Nails and Korn chief among them. One day, they got home, watched The Matrix, played Max Payne, saw the video for Korn's 'Freak on a Leash', and epiphanically said, 'Dude.' The entire mythology of Wanted can be unspooled simply by taking a cursory look around their shabby apartments. A normal man is informed that he is The Chosen One, out to avenge his murdered father, and is drafted into a secret group of gun-wielding revolutionaries that take him from his dead-end office job and train him. They train him to do amazing things to manipulate time and space, specifically in the form of moving and dodging bullets. He is tasked with practicing in hand, knife and firearm combat in various, shall we say, 'levels'. Sometimes he fails. No worries, he has infinite lives, as each time he is injured, the narrative merely restarts from a standard save point (in this point, a sort of bathhouse room) with all wounds healed, allowing him to try again. He is given a set group of tasks where he has to commit various acts of violence. Upon completion of these tasks (and a series of non-action-based cutscenes), he gets closer and closer to his ultimate goal, a 'boss fight' if you will. There are a few twists and turns, and we are taken to exotic locales and have plenty of running, car chases and gunplay.Unfortunately, another aspect in which Wanted resembles a video game is in its poor acting. James McAvoy's delivery is unbelievably poor. His American accent is solid, but he has no range and no believability whatsoever. Angelina Jolie has big fake-looking-lips and a gangly strut (although, if this was a video game, her breasts would be substantially larger; see Tomb Raider). Morgan Freeman is the token respectable name slumming, and he has such an authoritative voice that he sticks out for commendation even when he's phoning it in. The rest of the cast is generic in a way that you couldn't recognize them or care to if they weren't live in person in front of you.Now, this is not to say that a film that looks and runs like a video game can't be fun. Running Scared had a gonzo quality that still amounted to a 'go here and find this' plot line, and managed to be brilliantly entertaining. Crank was a bit more empty, but had several fantastically silly bits of over-the-top action that made you giggle even as you didn't care. Even Jumper salvaged a decent score because its effects were unique and exciting. Wanted lacks here as well. The film has a couple nifty scenes but overall, nothing all that fantastic occurs (specifically, nothing you haven't seen in The Matrix), and the film has so much slow-motion, the makers of 300 thought it was overkill.As stated, it's no fun to watch someone else play video games, and although they occasionally take your advice ('Dude, go back to your apartment and punch that douchebag Barry'; 'Oh sweet, I had to go retrieve the gun here anyway, thanks, bro'), for the most part, they frustrate you with their inability to instantly perform the tasks, and the character is sort of whiny and annoying anyway, and it's just not that much fun, especially since you've played so many games like this that were a lot more fun. Wanted is a mediocre video game, and a mediocre film. The film apparently did in fact get a video game translation. I can't speak for its quality, but as a film, Wanted feels like you rented a game, your friend made you watch him play, then took it back to the video store without even telling you. What a gyp.{Grade: 5.5/10 (high C) / #29 (of 64) of 2008}",5,7,22,15 August 2008
Quantum of Solace," Wonderful, hungry-erasing thriller.
","So there I sit. 7PM, Mountain Standard Time. My Broncos have just won a critical game, upsetting a favored New York team. I have done nothing of use, including a lack of consuming food for sustenance. Suddenly, my father BURSTS in my door, and announces that he's come to pick me up, and we're going to see the new Bond film, Quantum of Solace. It's the only time my stepmother has to go, and it's a 7:10 show, at a theater a dozen minutes away. As the lights dim and the trailers for Star Trek and Watchmen roll, it hits me: I never actually ate anything, and the troublesome car alarm in my head that triggers a migraine when I don't eat for long periods of time is enacted. Then, the film begins.My hunger was never an issue again.While it may not be better than Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace is a fairly glorious expansion on its predecessor, beginning with a thrilling car chase that becomes an even more thrilling foot chase, and from there, almost never lets up or steps wrong. The action scenes are spectacular, the scenes of intrigue clever and satisfying, and the scenes of tenderness as curt as Bond, especially now that they've given him emotional depth, for arguably the first time in the entire series. That the death of Vesper Lynn in the previous film becomes such a plot point in this one is notable when you think back to, for example, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, where Bond's girl is killed as they're getting MARRIED, and is almost instantly forgotten. Here, Bond carries this burden with him throughout the film, and pleasantly, instead of making his revenge the focus of the film (something the filmmakers very easily could have done), it becomes more a sort of overarching theme of individual morality, and it was damn refreshing.In the acting department, Daniel Craig does nothing to spoil his argument for being the best Bond of all. He may not have Connery's charisma, but everything else you could possibly want out of the character, Craig delivers, and I hope he remains Bond for the foreseeable future. The Bond girls, as would be expected dealing with someone as romantically grieving as Bond is, get the short shrift. His relation with Bolivian agent Camille (Olga Kurylenko) is almost wholly platonic, and his bedding of Fields (Gemma Arterton) is far more practical than hormonal. In fact, the woman he gets the closest to is the delightful M (Judi Dench), who has the audience's best interests at heart when dealing with Bond-related issues. On the other side, the producers got a hell of a find in Mathieu Amalric. His demonically wimpy disposition was perfectly balanced in a way I've never seen outside of perhaps Michael Emerson on Lost. Giancarlo Giannini, Jeffrey Wright and David Harbour provide ample characterization on underdeveloped characters, and really, there are no holes.Marc Foster (Stranger Than Fiction) was perhaps an unusual choice for a brutal action film, but he does an excellent job presenting everything: each new locale gets an exotic, awe-spiring establishing shots, and the editing and camera-work had a delightful clarity to it, solving the main drawback of last year's The Bourne Ultimatum, the epileptic camera obscuring what could otherwise have been quality choreography. Quantum lets you see every impact, so you can really appreciate the skill involved, and even the CGI is integrated flawlessly.The film isn't perfect. A small handful of scenes go on for too long, and Ms. Fields' appearance seems undersold in comparison to the rest of the film. Also, the grand finale in General Medrano's compound thing is excellent up to a point, but by the time he's having trouble incapacitating one wimpy executive and walking through fire and blowing out walls, suspension of disbelief is being spread a little thin. Luckily, by that point, the film had earned so much good will, it was easy to take it on the chin and move on, especially when the final denouement was so deliciously ruthless. Quantum of Solace is thrilling, wondrously-paced, and almost complete nonstop enjoyment. To be frank, I think the best compliment I can pay it is that it made me forget I hadn't eaten in 24 hours; It extinguished the fires brewing in my head, and that's a hell of an achievement.Now if you'll excuse me, I gotta get my ass something to eat.{Grade: 8.75/10 (A-/B+) / #2 (of 84) of 2008}",8,3,10,30 November 2008
Mamma Mia!," Messy and plodding theatre adaptation
","Musical theatre and theater have a symbiotic relationship since the dawn of sound. Movies have been adapted for theatre and staged across the nation and across the world. On the flipside, Hollywood has been taking inspiration for just as long, as seemingly every Broadway success had received a permanent place on the screen.'Mamma Mia!' is a member of the latter club, being a famous, successful play based upon the songs of disco-transcenders ABBA for years before getting the big-budget, big-setting, big-star permanence here in 2008. But what works on the stage, where there is live action, audience participation, interactive vibes (and most importantly, an intermission), doesn't necessary work on the silver screen. It's closest cinematic relative would be last year's luscious, hate-it-or-love-it Julie Taymor concoction, but ABBA isn't the Beatles, and 'Mamma Mia!' sure as hell ain't 'Across the Universe'.Where that film also had a flimsy excuse for a plot on which to hang a bunch of famous songs, it succeeded thanks to an absolutely breathtaking visual sensibility, as every scene was a feast for the eyes as well as the ears, and if you didn't necessarily come to care for the characters, it was probably for the best as you almost didn't have time, and another layer may have been sensory overlord. Well, you don't have to worry about that in 'Mamma Mia!', as the film's visuals are blaaand. The closest director Phyllida Lloyd comes is some crane shots and a few scenes in slow-motion.The film, as stated, a flimsy excuse to sing some songs, is as basic sitcom hijinks plot, a girl is getting married, and wants her long-lost father to come. She finds her mom's diary, and finds that she has three possible fathers, so she secretly invites them all. Hilarity ensues.Unfortunately, it appears that that was as far as they got. Its' Greek setting is pretty, but it does very little, and resembles nothing more than a play...set outside. The sea may be everpresent in the background, but it never feels OPEN, you never smell the air, feel the surf, the sort of things a film is supposed to make you feel. The lighting is garish and looks like the sort of lights you would see in a high school auditorium, lame fills just randomly placed. But the most egregious and downright baffling problem, considering the fact that IT'S BASED ON A SUCCESSFUL PLAY, is the choreography, which is simplistic and unimaginative that it looked like something my podunk college choreographer might have devised...on short notice. A couple steps to the left and right, a couple waves of the arms, and you're done. My grandmother would probably be able to not only memorize but perform this choreography in a matter of hours, and she just had both knees replaced.Speaking of that, another problem. The entire enterprise looks ragged and ugly, and while perhaps they thought that casting old ladies and not letting anyone wear makeup would be sort of endearing or charming or something, but instead, it just comes off like an absence of effort, like they all just called each other up on a Thursday and said 'Hey, wanna do a movie?' and had the reel in the can by Sunday morning. The fact that the film seems to have no idea about its timeframe only strengthens this suspicion. The three men are referred to and shown as a hippie, a '70s rocker and a punk 'headbanger', and are said that they all knew Streep biblically within a few weeks of each other, and of course, the daughter is twenty, which goes with none of them. It doesn't matter if they were trying to jokingly play with time, the way it comes off, It just seems sloppy.The one thing that should have worked, regardless of whether or not anything else worked, was the music, and even THAT was tough here. The title track was easily the only song to get any energy behind it, while the most famous ABBA song, 'Dancing Queen', that should have been an emotional centerpiece, is handled in such a stunningly awkward and embarrassing fashion that it's impossible to enjoy in any sense.The cast does their best to enliven the material, and several of them are too talented to give a bad performance. Amanda Seyfried, who should be the headliner, but apparently someone is unwilling to give her the push, is absolutely adorable, and I was surprised a woman directed the film, because while every other actor in the film is made to look at haggard as possible, the camera seemingly oggles her body at every opportunity. Meryl Streep is equally adorable, loose and funny in spurts, and the three-headed dad monster of Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgaard have a good chemistry between them and are pretty much the entire joy of the film. As for the rest of the cast, though...ugh. Dominic Cooper is empty eye candy for the ladies, Julie Walters is shrill and annoying, and Christine Baranski is a cipher who had no rhythm and is so uncoordinated and wound so tightly that her attempts to dance are as cringeworthy as the fact that they keep putting her in dance scenes.I am absolutely, positively gobsmacked that this film is as short as it is (1:48) The film was on its way to earning itself an extra half-point for a rousing wedding finale...before revealing that it's not actually the finale, and wasted upwards of TWENTY MINUTES unnecessarily tying up lose ends that don't need to be tied up. It just feels so overlong, messy, lacking inspiration and lacking enjoyment. Maybe the play is a bit of harmless fun, but as a film, 'Mamma Mia!' feels loose when it needs to be resigned, restrained when it needs to be fluid, and just ends up feeling like a waste of time.{Grade: 5/10 (C) / #32 (of 56) of 2008}",5,6,11,20 July 2008
Hellboy," More forgettable del Toro blather.
","I think it is well-established that if you enjoy comic books and comic book movies, my reviews are probably not the ones you want to peruse. Spider-Man 2 and X2 delivered, but pretty much every other contemporary superhero movie completely underwhelmed me with their extended runs of uninspiration. Most comic book movies (and I can only speak of the ones that are supposedly good; if I don't like Iron Man, how the hell am I going to enjoy Daredevil?) contain an intriguing premise buoyed by a distinctive main character, and then descend into complacency: extensive chases, EXTENSIVE CGI-based fight scenes, and perhaps a bit of dull political intrigue.Guillermo del Toro's Hellboy is pretty low on the political intrigue, instead choosing to utilize one of the three Just Add Water villain sects, the Nazis (in case you don't know, the other two varieties are 'Commies' and 'Terrorists', collect them all!). Nothing ever really comes of this, and that's really the problem with the film in general. It takes so much time setting up everything that when it finally gets around to DOING anything, it falls right in the rut of comic book banality. In fact, now that I think about it, it has a LOT of similarities to this year's Iron Man: The film's main selling point is a sarcastic wiseacre character essayed by a distinctive and talented actor, but in both situations, that is pretty much the film's ONLY selling point. For Iron Man, plot and story are a very distant second. For Hellboy, a distant third.Del Toro, as exhibited in other disjointed underwhelmers like The Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth, has a vivid, beautiful visual style, a striking color palette and an occasionally wonderful, evocative atmosphere (the scenes set in the cold, cold night outside especially vibe like a cityscape). But, like his other films, that's pretty much all they do. The characters aren't interesting, the stories don't go anywhere worthwhile, and the film goes on far too long. This is a film that takes fifteen minutes to set up its opening credits. Other than Hellboy, a blander set of heroes you will never see. John Hurt has fun getting to set up the trailer ('We are the ones that bump...back'), but doesn't do much else (and then gets bumped off No Country for Old Men-style) Rupert Evans has been in very little else, and with good reason. He has no presence, no charisma, and gets a lame character to boot. As for Selma Blair, there's a reason most people only know her as 'that chick that made out with Sarah Michelle Gellar'. Hellboy even loses interest after a while. He's introduced as a giant red John McClane, but where Downey's insistent cynicism wearied me of Iron Man, Hellboy goes the opposite way, making him a big red pussy underneath, and by the halfway point, he's writing poetry and brooding on a rooftop while his partner woos his girl, and I'm rolling my eyes and metaphorically crossing my arms and sighing.I would have recapped the plot, but as of this writing, it has been a whopping four minutes since the film's credits began, and I have already been forced to utilize several internet websites to remind me of the characters and occurrences herein. I've heard great things about the sequel, The Golden Army, but I obviously can't trust any of those things, because a lot of people (including critics I usually read and respect like J.Hoberman and Ed Gonzalez) thought Hellboy was awesome, and you see how this turned out for me. Oh, looking at the IMDb page, I totally forgot about Karel Roden as Griori Rasputin. I don't know if it's THAT Rasputin, because he's only present for about three scenes in the entire film, but he's supposed to be the villain. Other than having some sort of blonde woman with him (I would assume she has a name, but I'm failing this quiz), I don't remember him really doing...much of anything. I guess he fits the 'Commies' thing considering he's a Russian, and it's a bit odd to have an extended setup about Nazis, then have the villain be a forgettable Russki. Or a forgettable anything. What? That forgettable feeling pervades Hellboy as a whole, and I'm really in awe at Guillermo del Toro's plentiful 'talent' for making such ornately beautiful but mindbogglingly forgettable films. It's like every one of his films ends with a flash from a Men in Black Neutralizer. Ah, Men in Black. What a great film that was. Hell, boy, during Hellboy, I even found myself pining for Iron Man, and considering that film's 5/10 score, I can't possibly give this non-entity anything approaching that score, so I'll go one step down and hope for the best for the sequel.{Grade: 4/10 (C-) / #62 (of 65) of 2004}",4,1,3,5 September 2008
Moulin Rouge!," A would-be stage delight done a disservice on the screen.
","Ah, Moulin Rouge!. The spectacle to end all spectacles, the film that supposedly revived the flagged musical genre. This is the film that presumably, generations down the line, begat Julie Taymor's Across the Universe, a film that is obvious, poorly-acted, one-dimensional, patchwork, and frequently damn silly. It was also a film that was gloriously captivating, thanks to its tremendous visual sensibility, the soaring musical arrangements and the confidence in the material to play it seriously and believe that it would still succeed on its merits. Moulin Rouge! is a film that has so many of the same drawbacks, but fails to support its failings as Taymor did. The film is very, VERY bright and excited, but makes it mistake in thinking that being loud and obnoxious is the same as being vibrant and spectacular.Even with this, the film's main problem is that it's so goddamn cheeky. It picks songs that they know an audience will giggle about hearing played orchestrally ('Wouldn't it be funny if we had Jim Broadbent sing 'Like a Virgin'?' 'Ahahaha, genius') and then have every single actor play DIRECTLY TO THE CAMERA, which apparently allows them to throw of all pretence of subtlety and pummel each line into cheap-chuckle submission, with only Ewan McGregor coming out unscathed. Not a single action is taken for the characters' benefit, not a single line is said because it's realistic in context; every single beat is insistently directed straight to the audience's ugly mugs, just to make SURE that they have a good, cheap laugh, or are aware that they're singing another song the audience should know. 'REMEMBER THAT ONE?! HO HO, YOU LOVED THAT SONG, WASN'T THAT FUNNY?!' It's only one the nonsense calms down (for instance, during the 'love medley' does the film become anywhere near the sort of subtle, delicate sweetness that makes for a touching love scene.It's a lot like being on stage, really, and trying to appeal directly to the base, the simple, the Groundlings, if you will, and, perhaps not coincidentally, the only time the film gets any real traction, is when they move the film...to the stage! The audience, the lights, the sound, and especially the improvisation! In fact, this finale is so tremendously rousing that it damn near saves the entire film (and will probably garner it an entire half-point in my score. The fact is, this is a film that would be a spectacular-spectacular theatrical revue, but people, at least, this person, looks for completely different things from the stage and the screen. I was part of a local theatrical production called Everyman, which was a stupid, simplistic story (the kind where characters' personalities are in their names) held up by our director's choice of cheesy, obvious pop songs, but thanks to energy and the buzz amongst the crowd, the show was a rousing success, and many of those famous songs I have come to closely associate with that show. But it would lose everything on the screen, because despite their similarities, they're wholly different mediums, and trying to do something so suited for one in the realm of the other just results in inconsistent, unholy mediocrities like Moulin Rouge!.{Grade: 5.5/10 (C+/C) / #60 (of 68) of 2001}",5,1,2,28 November 2008
The Dark Knight," How do you hate the Greatest Film Ever Made?
","When the Joker showed up at Wayne's fundraiser for Harvey Dent, my tentative rating was at an 8.5. I was thoroughly enjoying myself, and was having it go mano-a-mano with my all-time favorite superhero movie, Spider-Man 2. By the time Batman swerved around the Joker on his motorcycle, I was getting a little restless, a 7.5 maybe, and set the score around 7.5 or so; still liked the film, and was pleased that at least I was going to give it a positive grade, to spare myself the hassle. By the time Harvey Dent was chillin' in a warehouse with ol' Jim, I was rooting for Batman to die if only to end the film more quickly.There is a good film in here. Hell, there's a GREAT film in here, but my god, to humanize this film is to implore it to do a few crunches. The Dark Knight is hideously, mindbogglingly, monstrously overlong. Every source physical and electronic had informed me that the time FLEW by that it may have lasted two hours and thirty-two minutes, but it sure as hell didn't feel like it. Well, they're right. It DIDN'T feel like two hours and thirty-two minutes. It felt like three. By the time Dent got his faced burned, I was glad that it was finally wrapping up, because it had gone on a bit too long at that point. The HOUR that it spent unnecessarily wrapping up plot strands after that scene was what killed the film for me.There was definitely a lot to like here. In a superhero film, the constant is the hero, the variable, and thus, the definition of quality, is in the villain. The Joker is the best of the Batman villains because he's the most colorful, and yet the most terrifyingly plausible. He embodies things we fear on a fundamental level: People who hide their identity,in masks and grotesque makeup, who are unhinged, who can and will do anything on a whim. Where other villains include a poof who tells riddles and a man raised by penguins sewer (don't worry about correcting me if I got that wrong, I don't care), the Joker seems horrifyingly impervious to scrutiny.In the acting department, I had surprisingly little problem with Bale. He seemed less brooding and more personable, more lively than I had seen him. When he put on his scaaawy voice, my entire theater chuckled, but I understood what he was trying to do; it far more real and acceptable than before. As for the rest of the cast, Ledger did a good job, but by the halfway point, I grew tired of the film treating him as an go-to gag machine. The longer we sat with him, I saw him descend from Jerry Brudos into Jerry Lewis. People seem to overestimate the difficulty in playing a crazy person. Talk with a funny voice, affect a little walk, invent a couple of mannerisms, it's really all in the definition. The entire film, I was thinking: You know who could have been fabulous at this role? Andy Dick. Seriously, Ledger's put-on voice sounded almost exactly like Dick's normal voice, and there's a built-in hatred for the man anyway, what better way to immediately cultivate a visceral audience reaction? I think he could have done a fine job. Aaron Eckhart, on the other hand, was quite poor. He had the chiseled chin, and I know the man can act, but here he just seemed out of his element. Far too often, I saw Aaron Eckhart acting when I should have seen Harvey Dent speaking. As for positives, I thought Maggie Gyllenhall was a tremendous upgrade on Katie Holmes. She infused the character with dimensions and life, and she convinced me every second she was on screen. Michael Caine also did a fine job, and I want to give a mention to Eric Roberts, who I thought stained the screen with the sleaze emitting from his body in his meager calls to set. Most of the rest of the cast had little to do, although I was still lamenting that, as good as job as he did on the good side, possibly the great go-to villain actor of the last generation will never be given a chance to enliven a Batman villain.Batman Begins, which I gave a 6/10, ran 2:20. I don't remember feeling it was overlong, just sort of lame. While, The Dark Knight is as far from lame as you can get, but that other problem reared its ugly had and caused me far more pain that the immediate fizzle of its predecessor, because it had so much going for it, and it seemed to have squandered it with a wasted hour that did NOTHING NEW for the characters. Did anything that important happen in the final hour of the film that hadn't happened at least once beforehand? And every new thing they did introduced was so labored and obvious that it was just as much of a time waster as everything else.The word, more than any other, that I want to use for my opinion towards this film is 'lament'. I wanted to LOVE this film, to be greeted with open arms by my electronic peers into their cool, hip club that apparently numbers in the billions. And my initiation was all set. Bruce, Chris & I had passed several hurdles, several tests, on our way to being accepted together, hand-in-hand, brothers in arms. But like Harvey Dent's infamous coin, the game was rigged. They flipped it until we failed, and fall flat on our faces we did. Or at least, I did. We took part in a five-legged race, and they persevered while I got stuck with the shackles, and that's too bad. The finish line was in site, but they kept moving it back, and all I taste is dirt.{Grade: 6.25/10 (C+) / #16 (of 60) of 2008}",6,18,36,28 July 2008
The Happening," Shockingly inept in every facet
","The Happening (2008, M. Night Shyamalan) It's been long-established that my experience is limited to one film pertaining to possibly the most infamous director of our generation, M. Night Shyamalan. He's a director that seems to inspire hyperbolic opinions in both directions, with The Sixth Sense being the only film of his that a solid majority of people seem to agree is any good (it's also the only film I've seen). But no one can decide 'masterpiece or 'disaster' for Unbreakable, Signs, The Village, Lady in the Water...okay, maybe not Lady in the Water. Well, his newest film, The Happening, is another one to argue about.The film, like all of Shyamalan's films, has an intriguing premise. For this one, it involves a mysterious airborne toxin of some sort that is making people kill themselves. The plot line follows a small group of people including a science teacher (Mark Wahlberg), his underdeveloped wife (Zooey Deschanel), his coworker, a math teacher (John Leguizamo), and a plant dude with a beard (An Actor Dude with a Beard).Shyamalan's direction and editing is almost hysterically stiff. He seems to have absolutely no idea how to frame a shot, and he seems to cut to reaction shots at the most bizarre times, resulting in a visual style and rhythm so awkward that it literally elicited derisive laughter from me on several occasions. The acting is as poor as the direction, as the entire principal cast delivers their lines with such unsureness that they come off as thought this is the first time they've read the script (which is horrible anyway), with Mark Wahlberg giving one of the worst performances I've ever seen in the history of cinema. Outside of Boogie Nights, I've never been too impressed with Wahlberg as an actor, and I thought he was easily the worst part of The Departed (despite his baffling Oscar nomination), and here he gives as cringe-worthy a performance as you're ever likely to see. The rest of the cast from the usually marvelous Zooey Deschanal, to the usually solid John Leguizamo to literally every single minor character in the entire film.The film does contain some interestingly-structured death scenes, including some nifty shots (the early shot with the construction workers plummeting on the building comes to mind) early on to set up the 'terrorism', but even these are poorly-done, as his framing is amusingly prudish and stagey (the cop and cabbie shooting themselves in the head early on being the most egregious offender, as they brace themselves as they fall to the ground despite supposedly being dead, and of course the camera is within inches of them, making it all so upfront). Also, since these scenes only last half a minute or so, he supplants this hole with intolerable relationship trauma, as our main characters fill lots of screen time just bickering at each other, and by the time the woman in the Jeep with Leguizamo began screaming, the film turned from silly to obnoxious, and as we waste more time going over the same bullsh-t over and over, it went from obnoxious to interminable, and by the time they're getting threatened by crazy old ladies, it's just run off the rails and embedded itself in the ground.Basically, it's like Zach Snyder's Dawn of the Dead, except that all the actors suck, the director sucks, the movie sucks and instead of reanimated corpses that crave flesh, it's...plants. The film is so silly, so amusingly inept that it vaults itself over true intolerable badness like Diary of the Dead and Prom Night, and triumphs over In the Name of the King to win the Unintentional Comedy sweepstakes.{Grade: 3.5/10 (D+/D) / #46 (of 53) of 2008}",3,5,11,8 July 2008
WALL·E," Glorious animation with heart outclasses everything this year.
","From Curious George to E.T. and right on down to the present day, cinema-goers have always had a strong affinity towards, for lack of a better term, 'curious little critters', small animals, aliens or other beings who are simultaneously inquisitive and clueless about the ways of Earth, and are preferably also quite clumsy, and Wall-E, as a character and as a movie, delivers in spades. Taking a pratfall as effortlessly as Keaton, and doing a terrified double take better than the most racist of cinema servitude, the sentient being, whose job it is to pick up and compact trash on a desolate future Earth, is equally fascinated by the inner workings of lightbulbs, Twinkies, garbage can lids and iPods, but can't seem to cover his head, as countless manner of things continually seem to be crashing down upon it. This mundane existence is shattered by a mysterious craft that deploys a scanning probe, another sentient being, this time with an infectious giggle and an itchy trigger finger, named Eve.Pixar has an uncanny knack for turning familiarity into universiality. Case in point: the love story presented in 'WALL-E' is a story that doesn't take a single turn that hasn't been preordained by 80 years of cinema history, but Pixar still manages to turn it on its ear: The love story here is between robots, and our protagonists, despite only having model numbers and call signs for names, and literally knowing four words between them (two, discounting their own names), are more human than any couple seen on the silver screen in some time, and when life and responsibility intervene, there's a sense of heartbreak and loss seldom possible with flesh and blood.The second act takes us as far in the other direction as possible, as Eve is picked back up by her ship, and Wall-E hitches a ride on the side, desperate for his only love. The scenes of travel here function as both a sort of montage, a transition between acts, but also serve to provide the audience with what may be the most awe-inspiring presentation of space seen since '2001', which also gets an immediately recognizable character nod that could work as a gap to that film when they're older. What he finds when the ship arrives is a completely autonomous society, co-existing between morbidly obese humans on floating chairs, no longer required to do anything of effort, even communicating on viewscreens directly across from each other, coexisting with all manner of robotic denizens, who have far more of the human experience than their living counterparts, including frustrated custodians, tough-as-nails security officers and even a mental health ward.I won't take the time to explain the particulars of the humans' situation, or any more of the plot, because part of the fun is exploring for yourself. Pixar has never been one to skimp on the details, and every inch of the screen is filled with glorious colors, wondrous intricacies and charming touches that just add to the amazing glory unfolding before you. The fact that you know what's going to happen is less of a detriment and more of a comfort, much like watching a old video of your favorite sports' team's greatest triumph: You may know all the ups and down, but on screen, it's always happening for the first time, and damnit, it feels that way too, a testament to the skill, expertise and above all HEART, something Pixar has always seemed to possess just a little bit more of than everybody else, like they discovered some hidden secret on how to entertain everybody, to transcend labels like 'children's movie', 'animated movie' or even 'family movie', to where all you have to say is 'Pixar', and the inference is there: You're going to love it, and Pixar has stepped up to say, 'Don't give up on 2008 just yet.' As for 'WALL-E', the message is clear: All you need is love (All together now!). All you need is love (Everybody!). All you need is love, love...Love is all you need.{Grade: 9.5/10 (A) / #1 (of 53) of 2008 / #187 of all time}",9,9,15,20 July 2008
Never Back Down," Ludicrous rehashing of genre clichés.
","Ever seen Fight Club, Snatch or The Karate Kid? So has Jeff Wadlow.The glorious strands of one-dimensionality, based off of slavish devotion to those three films, course through Never Back Down, a plodding, braindead rich-kid hybrid of the three that, had it not occasionally gotten so amusingly boffo ludicrous, would have been damn near unbearable to sit through.We have a myriad of types on display for you to enjoy, including Our Hero, Jake Tyler (Sean Faris), a pugnacious prodigy who is, of course, damaged goods. His father died in a car accident when he drunkenly wrapped his junker around a pole with Jake in the car. Jake was like 16 and probably should have driven that day, something that haunts Jake unceasingly, and something with which the folks on the football gridiron use as ammunition while Tyler is omnisciently slaughtering them (the film gives us several minutes of football footage, and not a single person other than Jake makes a tackle, despite being one of eleven guys and the plays concluding all about the field). He ends up roughing up a dude on the field, which, thanks to YouTube, follows him to his new school in Florida, where he DOESN'T WANNA FIGHT ANY MORE! But he is induced to by our second type, Cockyrival McDouchebag, aka our very own Cobra Kai, Ryan McCarthy (the ridiculously-named Cam Gigandet) He's a impossibly proficient mixed martial artist, and he goads Our Hero into fighting him at a party after kissing his girlfriend, the preposterously-named Baja (Amber Heard), aka Love Interest, whom Our Hero has struck up an acquaintance with (in an amusingly artificial classroom scene where he expounds on the anti-war intricacies of The Iliad), and is a bit smitten.Also in this class, he meets our Annoying Sidekick, Max (Evan Peters), who saw him on YouTube and invites him to train with this film's Miyagi, the mythical Jean Roqua (Djimon Hounsou, looking like he really wanted the paycheck). Roqua warns him that his class is not to be used for fighting in the real world. Our Hero agrees, and thus begins this movie's peculiar sense of morals, most succinctly personified by a pivotal late scene. Let me set the table here: Cocky McDouchebag, to get Our Hero to fight at a secret underground Totally-Not-Fight-Club fight club, assaults Annoying Sidekick, putting him in the hospital. Our Hero informs Love Interest that he's going to the fight club and fighting him. Love Interest, rightfully, intones that this is exactly what Douchey wanted him to do, to desire revenge. Our Hero screams that what he's doing 'isn't about revenge!', then proceeds on a course of action that can directly, 100% ONLY be defined as 'revenge' (by doing exactly what Cocky wanted him to). The film seems to believe that 'to exact punishment and take vengeance, retaliation to avenge for injuries or wrongs' somehow does not equal 'revenge', and by this point, both his mother (who was vehemently opposed to him even training in a gym not three scenes prior) and Djimon Miyagi (who has his own retarded backstory for not fighting) are totally down with doing exactly what he had planned to do the entire movie, except now because the script told them it wasn't revenge, I guess it's okay.The film is far more tolerable than a lot of the crap this year, mostly because it's so gosh darn silly, and my recommendation would be to rent this with a large group of your most boisterous friends, revel in the bone-crunching action, and mock the rest of it. I promise, you'll have a great time.{Grade: 4/10 (C-) / #41 (of 62) of 2008}",4,2,5,11 August 2008
Casino Royale," Lean, mean, and the best Bond of all
","I had a chance to see Casino Royale back when it was originally in theaters. People talked about how much of a wonderful 'return to form' it was, and I had an idea for watching all the Bond movies then, and considering what I had heard about Die Another Day, I didn't want to mess up chronology AND leave myself without a happy ending.So, now I can say it: This isn't a return to form, this isn't an update, this is a press of the reset button. Bond is back to his lean, mean Dr. No/Living Daylights self, although this fella is even more ruthless than ol' Sean ever was, and adds suspense, intrigue and INTENSITY to the dour, joyless latter film.There's a lot of new things for Bond here. Bond falls in love, Bond screws up and really gets in trouble for it (as opposed to the normal 'Bond screws up, they yell and he does exactly the same thing), Bond gets ARRESTED, Bond gets drugged (AND ALMOST DIES!), Bond gets TORTURED, the list goes on and on.This series has always made seem Bond impossibly invincible. It was refreshing to see him seem vulnerable (who would have thought I could say the phrase 'Bond's shower scene' and come away feeling TOUCHED?). I'd never felt SUSPENSE or tension in a James Bond film, where Bond was doing something that he could get *caught* at, it's amazing.There's also a lot MISSING from this series, there's a complete lack of gadgets (in fact, not even a Q), and most wonderfully, they have dispensed with the chintzy sex jokes. Yes, there's moments of humor, but they're all organic and subtle, based out of the story and the interaction of the characters, who, by the way, are all fleshed out to realistic depth levels. The villain is no cackling megalomaniac. He's just a drug terrorist/criminal. And he's less cartoonish than the only other halfway down-to-earth criminal (from License to Kill).The film has also managed to bring Bond into the 21st century in a realistic sense. This isn't the 'see! we're hip too! WE GOT VIDEOGAMEZ!' bent of Never Say Never Again, or the 'We have an invisible car. An *INVISIBLE CAR*!' ridiculousness of Die Another Day (by the way, the cars actually break when you crash in this movie). They make an offhand reference to Photoshop and have technology for sensible reasons, not silly ones.What's amazing about the series is that, to wipe away for memories of the Brosnan films, they brought in the creative team behind...the Brosnan films. The director of Goldeneye, the writers of The World is Not Enough and Die Another Day, and Judi Dench as M.Acting-wise, I've already discussed Craig, Eva Green is the most intriguing, intelligent, interesting Bond girl ever, Judi Dench is just ANGRY, exasperated as Bond keeps screwing up, the villain is vicious (but not invincible!), a small role for Jeffrey Wright is understated and wonderful as always.I know that everyone had wanted a change of pace from the Brosnan films, but I think one man had more to do with this change of pace than any: Jason Bourne. In the four years between Bond films, ol' J.B. rose up and became THE action spy king, with a more visceral, intelligent, cerebral, cold-blooded superhero, and just like 28 Days Later set the bar a little higher and helped Dawn of the Dead become as good as it was, our favorite amnesiac set the bar up here for the Bonds to jump over, and boy, did they ever.On the technical side of things, Martin Campbell has one definitely leg up on the Bourne series: he knows how to keep his camera still during fight scenes.It was wonderful, touching, thrilling, suspenseful, interesting, and just...the best Bond there is. And, almost as an afterthought, but I'm ranking this film not only in Bond films, but in its own year as well, and considering the weak year 2006 was, it should be no surprise that it makes my top 10 of the year as well. Good on ya, James. Keep up the good work.{Grade: A- / #9 (of 64) of 2006 / #1 (of 22) of the James Bond series}",9,3,7,29 July 2008
Pineapple Express," Giggly Ganja Glory
","2008 as a cinematic entity for this cinema viewer has been a been of a wash: a tidal wave of heavy sighs, restless shifts and paragraph after paragraph of vitriolic, disappointed criticism. My film partners and providers, my father and stepmother usually leave the theater feeling pleasant and entertained, while I emerge walking a bit more briskly because it was way too long, it was way too obvious, and I wanted to like it but, damnit, it just wasn't any good!! Pineapple Express opens with a dumb, obvious and unnecessary flashback starring Bill Hader, about the initial reasoning behind criminalizing marijuana, and those fears, that it would be just like the rest began to bubble up.Then, the opening credits began to roll.I'm not sure that there is anything genuinely funny in the entirety of Pineapple Express, and yet...for the life of me, I could not stop giggling. From the opening server montage up until about the necessary break-up scene, there were some concerns that I wasn't going to get enough oxygen to my brain, because I just didn't have TIME to breathe. The film follows a stoner process server (Seth Rogen) who, after witnessing a murder committed by a cop (Rosie Perez) and his dealer's dealer's dealer (Gary Cole), flees with his dealer (James Franco). Well, sort of. There are, of course, a flurry of unseen complications, almost wholly because they're completely baked. (The only reason they are tracked down is because they are literally the only men in town with a certain insanely potent strand of the sticky called 'Pineapple Express'.) My first question is, how the hell did David Gordon Green get involved in this? The director of ornate, somber and critically respected dramas like George Washington, All the Real Girls, Undertow and Snow Angels is the man that lensed this modern day stoner opus. I have to believe he's a partaker, that can be the only explanation, and I'd gladly welcome him to that brotherhood (of which I am but an honorary member; I smoked a few times in 7th grade, it had no effect on me, so I never did it again, yet people think I'm stoned all the time anyway, so I've deduced that it comes naturally to me. ) As for his direction, the film's more action-based aspirations makes this an absolutely essential addition to the squad; his hand is sure and makes scenes that could have been laughably inept, into believable and brutally hilarious bits of fight choreography.This is not to say that these are tight, concise action sequences that will thrill and amaze you. Much of the film after the first hour is rambling, halfway incoherent and goes on way too long, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Considering the accomplished nature of its director, I have to believe this was deliberate. A buzz doesn't last forever, and you can feel the film coming down. Sometimes reality can come in and blow your buzz, especially if it comes with automatic weaponry, and the film reflects that to a 'T'. Every scene comes with an improvisational, wandering, incoherent and above all utterly BLOWN vibe to it, which impressed me with its accuracy and realism.Of course, considering its star, the film should have no trouble with inebriated realism. While John Cho or Kal Penn may very well enjoy puffing on the cheeba, the Harold & Kumar series very much feels like the studio IDEA of what a stoner film should like like. As for PE, Seth Rogen is THC's most prominent cheerleader, and the substance's influence colors every frame of the film. I assume they saved money on an acting coach for James Franco, as he presumably had everything he needed right in front of him. For the rest of the cast, this looked like a fun set, filled with friends, buddies, That Guys and That Girls. I have a feeling Danny McBride just plays himself in every movie. Gary Cole gives his all despite his underdeveloped character, as the entire cast, Kevin Corrigan, Craig Robinson, Rosie Perez, Ed Begley Jr., Nora Dunn, from top to bottom, a set I just would love to be on. I saw the adorable Amber Heard in the plodding crapfest Never Back Down earlier this week, and it's refreshing to see this charming little lady in a good film, even if her role resembles nothing more than a plot prop.Overall, I'm just relishing the opportunity to not be the party-pooper in the theater, as I have seemingly disagreed with Everybody on Everything this year, with me always in the negative. It's my birthday on Monday, let my dad be the hater for once. I realize this review is rambling, halfway incoherent and goes on way too long, so I'm just gonna go ahead and claim that its structure is as deliberately ragged as the film's. I had a blast, I'm rockin' out, and...oh dear...I appear to have gotten my foot stuck in the windshield.{Grade: 8.5/10 (B+) / #2 (of 63) of 2008}",9,3,7,11 August 2008
