Catch Me If You Can," Catch this sexy entertaining light crime caper now! Thanks Steven Spielberg yet again!
",After the dark worlds Steven Spielberg imagined in AI Artificial Intelligence and Minority Report Steven Spielberg has fun again with this entertaining light bonbon of a film which has a lot of fun telling a serious story it feels like you're drinking a cup of tea and a biscuit with this film I know that might seem a bit silly but it is so light and frothy it entertains and charms you although there's a serious story to tell about fraud and investigative crimes It reminds of a style of film made in the 1960s but was old fashioned this is a rare style of film which does not get made any more this is the only film I have seen recently which is a serious story with a light undertone I enjoy the fast pace of the film You are running with Frank and Carl it is so fast paced boom boom boom etc run run run you have to pay attention with the film other wise there is no enjoyment I do think if you come in at half a hour in it will bore you It does not for me but for 1st time viewers you might not like this film I love the energy of the film and light performances from Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio Christopher Wallken deserves a Honorable mention however for his stunning performance as Frank's father Oscar Winning in my opinion just beautifully devious and full of gleeful deception like he enjoys what Frank is doing impersonating a doctor a air line pilot a Lutheran etc Carl Hanratty's Character has a wicked sense of irony and is extremely dead pan about the whole situation he never enjoys the light comedic foreplay of Frank and his delicious enjoyment of evading the law because Frank Knows he is going to get caught he just wants to enjoy the moment while he can before his life escapes him he does not want to be classed and know as a criminal he is 17 years old he has his whole life ahead of him and that's why he does things quickly getting married getting many jobs as he can without telling anyone what he really is a con man Leo's Performance is one of pure genius and invention he can slip into any character or persona in a finger snap when he is coning everyone he is loving every minute of it when he is serious mainly with the scenes With Christopher Wallken he really acts and understands the brevity and the consequences of his actions it is a extraordinary performance of real style and sophistication I love the sexiness of the cinematography and music it looks sexy and retro and really old fashioned The music has a sexiness and a coolness almost erotic in it's performances on the saxophone Stunningly sexy and erotic sax solos by Dan Higgins Just Incredibly sexy and erotic almost soothing like a love poem The film's style and shot composition has a stunning hint of sexuality in the clothes the characters and how the women are perceived All the women as Soon as Frank meets them swoon all over him and have sex with him he is a elusive man a real smooth classy man which is a rare commodity these days! I can't not mention the really sexy erotic score by John Williams which is a beautifully stunningly sexy showcase for the saxophone just beautifully erotic and sexy which is really interesting for John Williams because it is rare for Him and Steven Spielberg to direct and compose a score for a film like this they have not made a film like this recently a sexy erotic score with almost no other musical accompaniment the stunningly sexy saxophone solos are beautifully composed and painstakingly planned and timed to perfection just classy and sexy Thanks John Williams yet again it is an beautifully gorgeous sexy sophisticated score and your outstandingly beautifully sexy musical contribution to the film is undeniably perfection sheer perfection! Thank You Steven Spielberg for making a wonderfully entertaining light breath of air of a film after the darkness that prevailed AI and Minority Report Steven Spielberg lightens the mood with Catch Me if you can he entertains and really thrills you with the most sexy crime caper I have ever seen!,10,2,3,3 September 2015
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Indiana Jones the greatest adventure hero of all time take that Mr Bond!
",Raiders of the Lost Ark the greatest adventure movie of all time nothing tops it nothing! Harrison Ford stars as the bull whip loving archaeologist and Karen Allen is his longtime girlfriend Marion Ravenwood!. They are the greatest on screen couple in the history of film! The story is simple but fun and really entertaining once the adventure gets going but you need the backstory first before the adventure can begin and it is a supernatural force not something to be taken lightly but it is a force of supernatural power that can control everything in your grasp! The direction of this heart stopping movie is phenomenal and something as I said earlier will never be bettered! The Master of film really needed a miracle after the failure of 1941 and boy did he make a adventure classic he really did! I want to talk about John Williams's Theme which is so iconic you can hum it straight away I mean I know every part of the theme every single section of the music I can follow the film along and notice every thrilling trumpet solo and every beat and action the music provides just every section of that unforgettable theme is memorable even the love theme of Marion and Indy's relationship is so perfect! There are some special scenes that are perfect for studying film and it's needs to entertain the fist fight the truck chase are perfect examples of this! John's music scores both of those scenes and all the action scenes the basket game and the Arab swordsman who Indy shoots in the film's best moment of comedy are all scored beautifully and perfectly! Every time the theme is played you know Indy is doing something heroic or heart stopping because you associate the theme with Indy and the adventure and every time the music does not play it means Indy is not on the screen it could be Marion or the Germans that is so important to the film and impossible to replicate in an action film! Just a outstanding action film perfect for kids and adults too it brings out the child in all of us!,10,2,5,20 November 2014
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," ET phone home Family classic From the Master of Film!
","ET The Extra Terrestrial is a wonderful magical emotional powerful movie all about loss hope sadness redemption and wonder really wonderfully enchanting I will talk about the direction and score now! The Direction captures the film from the children's point of view for the majority of the film it really captures the magic and happiness the children feel as they bond with ET it really matters that the film is captured from Elliot's point of view because he needs a friend and feels lonely scared frightened about his childhood because his parents are divorced and he does not have no friends to talk to no bonding connection so to speak until ET comes in and changes the family almost like Mary Poppins in a way the friendship grows and develops into something very magical and poignant, when the threat of ET possibly dying is discovered the emotion that Elliot goes through is so touching the scene where ET is in the box and Elliot explains his love and affection for ET is heartbreaking helped by John Williams's Oscar winning score just captures the mood of the film beautifully when the Bicycle flies over the moon is the greatest shot in film and the score helps Elliot and ET fly over the moon it really does John Williams made that film what it is today obviously The Master of Film did too but still the movie should have won Best Picture not Gandhi! The score's melodic material is so wonderful heartfelt and really magical almost like a lullaby at the end when the threat of ET dying looms it really is special and like the last 20 minutes of Close Encounters of the Third Kind John Williams's score ends the film as the Children get ET back to his spaceship and the whole sequence as ET says goodbye to the children is scored beautifully and the whole Elliot hugging ET and the spaceship flying away and the family looking on as it does so is all scored by John Williams's magical finale literally the piece is 15 minutes long and covers the whole last sequence of the movie every frame is scored to perfection and if you tried to take the score out of ET the power would not be there the emotional pull would not be there particularly in that last 15 sequence! ET is one of the greatest family movies ever made it can be put on a List with Back to The Future, Mary Poppins, Shrek, Who Framed Roger Rabbit the list goes on!",10,1,3,21 June 2015
Minority Report," Steven Spielberg takes you into the future in this absolutely extraordinary thrill ride of a film thank you yet again Steven Spielberg!
",Minority Report A film that perfectly shows Steven Spielberg's versatility and breathtaking directing skills I have just viewed this film for the first time and I was blown away Really blown away What A fantastic thrill ride and a thought provoking study of the future what can we predict will happen and what will happen That is the reason behind Precrime's existence to prevent murders from taking place and it is a film where you have to dissect every piece of the story other wise if you do not pay attention you don't understand what's going on I love that sort of film a film which questions your understanding of the story the characters and the underlying themes and questions of the film which is how can we predict the future what can we see with our thoughts and our emotional cores that's what the Pre Cogs do they dissect each murder there are 3 Pre Cogs 2 male and 1 female Agatha is the key to the story the other 2 need her to properly function and work as they should work because Pre Crime has never failed but there is a problem with Pre Crime and the Pre Crime team led by John Anderton must dissect the problem and wonder where are Pre Crime's flaws what is the thing that makes it work as well as it does but there is a dark mystery a suspect a clue a hidden memory visions of death relating to 2 people Anne Lively and Leo Crow Now John Anderton is suspected of murdering one of them That I am not giving away you will just have to watch the film and find out! Steven Spielberg's direction is extraordinary and visceral the color palate and the shots are all darkened and very atonal almost like a dark painting or a vision of the future as it so happens it is unusual to see Steven Spielberg use these color schemes and shot compositions it is lit very eerily and atonal which is unusually odd for Steven Spielberg to shoot a film like this he is experimenting with different shots colors he is trying to change the way we make films and entertain the audiences's he makes the films he makes for and tell a original story with an imaginative vision That's why Steven Spielberg is the greatest film director of our time he makes a genre of film new again he breathes life into the film noir and makes it entertaining for the audience that's the goal that's his job to tell the type of story which Minority Report is trying to tell and not make it sound old fashioned he makes it new again for the new generation of film Makers! The film has a beautiful score by John Williams Sean's theme is one of the best individual theme he has ever composed for a film and the suite which I call Theme From Minority Report combines Sean's theme and new themes in there as well and plays over the end credits as well as that separate performance of Sean's theme which I will not give away what the theme underscores because the film will be ruined! Tom Cruise's performance was fantastic And Max Von Sydow's performance too was phenomenal and when the twist comes relating to his character he really delivers Kudos to Colin Farrell and Samantha Morton 2 great performances! Thank you yet Again Steven Spielberg and John Williams for another incredible and unforgettable movie experience it really questions the future and what will the Future be like what can we do to prevent murders and crimes from Happening! Thanks Tom Cruise you have actually made a film I can Watch you in now!,10,1,2,2 September 2015
Amistad," Give us our freedom! The Master Of Film's most important and emotional film!
",I want to start this review by asking a question why does this film get overlooked by many people why I do not have a clue I may have a vague idea because the subject matter does not concern it's audience or it has been forgotten or nobody remembers the events of the film I think this film is so important and this was my first viewing of the film and I am lost for Words yet again I hear Steven Spielberg really wanted to direct this film a lot and it shows how committed to the story and the characters The performances are outstanding Sir Anthony Hopkins is John Quincy Adams simple as that Djimon Hounsou as Cinqué is a major discovery and I admire his performance greatly Morgan Freeman is outstanding as Theodore Joadson Nigel Hawthorne is extraordinarily heartbreaking Just great performances all around Matthew McConaughey as Roger Sherman Baldwin is the best performance in the whole film he is our leader our guide throughout the whole film and delivers in every scene Thanks Matthew you made this film come alive and I will never forget your performance thank you so so much this is your film and Djimon Hounsou as Cinque thank you as well this is a remarkable achievement I love the scenery and the cinematography by Janusz Kamiński and the Editing by Michael Kahn is outstanding and never drags on despite the fact it is almost 2 and a half hours it is a outstanding story and a unforgettable movie experience almost like the Color Purple and Empire of the Sun but Steven Spielberg tells the story differently it almost feels like a fight for survival and it is but the courtroom scenes are directed differently and the tone changes as the film stops to reflect and to think why and to question the reasons of the case why it was needed to happen and to uphold the American Constitution John Williams's outstanding emotive score is very understated and patriotic but the themes are wonderful for each part of the story Cinque's theme is wonderful one of the best pieces of music John Williams's has ever composed it is perfect the flute is incredible and the orchestra rises to play the theme as well and the trumpet intersperses the main theme with it too the hymn piece Dry your tears Afrika just to finish here I want people to think about equality and basic human values what does one act cost freedom or death that is the theme of the film One act can change the world and the way we treat everyone around with compassion or with hatred that is what Steven Spielberg asks us as he does in the Color Purple and Schindler's list and now with Amistad how do we feel about hatred do we think it is the right path to a normal happy life or is it a unjust decision to treat people that have done no harm to anyone with such intolerance and suffering for no logical reason it is just the way things worked or so we think that is the right cause of action As John Quincy Adams says it is not about what they are it is about who they are what's their story what will we remember them for the sacrifice their determination to win over such forces of evil and as John Quincy Adams says at the end any human being whether he or she be black or white will try again and again to get home where they belong where we all belong What the film teaches us is how do we accept race or religion at the end of the film John Quincy Adams says if he were another nationality we would treat him with respect and compassion songs would be written books would be filled with his stories let all people lead the life they want to lead and do not forget them who they are what is their goal what is their story and their reasons for existing in the world what do they contribute to society how do they support actions democracy or leadership what is their dreams and hopes? Just think about that for a moment Thank you Steven Spielberg thank you John Williams yet again this is an unforgettable film and it is highly underrated seek this film out now I urge everyone who has not seen this film to do so now!,10,0,3,20 August 2015

The Adventures of Tintin," Steven Spielberg takes you on a wonderful thrill ride for the whole family in a wonderfully entertaining family film!
","Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was a wonderful entry in the Indiana Jones franchise and was wrongfully hated on by fans of the series, with the Adventures of Tintin there was a much stronger fan base that were anticipating great things from the Master of Film and so was I despite the fact I have never read the comics they have been quickly glanced at by me but nothing more than that anyway the trailers griped me and I got really excited having know that the Master of Film was back directing again after another 3 year absence which is common for him at the moment, anyway did the film meet my expectations or did they sink down faster than Haddock's ship?, well I was wonderfully entertained thrilled jaw dropped and just wonderfully relieved although I was not worried about the film at all I knew it would be wonderfully entertaining I was relieved that Steven Spielberg's directing abilities had not declined or slowed down they were the same as always this film has a wonderfully fast pace to the outstanding action sequences and the breathtaking fluidity of the movement of the camera as we're flying around with Tintin and Haddock as the camera literally is flying around the screen like a balletic movement or performance is simply outstanding film making of the highest standard and Steven Spielberg must be commended for that. Martin Scorsese does not make movies like Steven Spielberg! Martin Scorsese makes the same type of movies over and over again with no versatility or change of style it's boring the only film of his I will ever watch again anyway is Hugo that's an outstanding movie really wonderfully cinematic and a stunning tribute to the old days of cinema just an amazing technical achievement and a great example of how films should be made but aren't anymore which is a deep shame, anyway I bring Hugo up in this Tintin review because Tintin shows us the future of motion picture film making with motion capture technology and Hugo takes us to the old fashioned days of motion picture making with images sound and color, Tintin has an outstanding visual language what I am referring to is how the shots look clearer and the characters feel different and look different because of this motion capture technology which enhances humans's emotions and textures, the technology was perfected in the Lord of the Rings film series over a decade ago to great critical acclaim and admiration by the film industry, anyway why do I love Tintin so much apart from the outstanding motion capture technology and the stunning flying balletic movement of the camera? it's because of the story the characters the locations the performances by Andy Serkis who played Gollum in the Lord of the Rings films and Jamie Bell who I loved in Billy Eliot which I watched recently and adored I love his charming performance in that film really lovely film that one! anyway Snowy's my favourite character in the film he's so lovingly recreated from the drawings I quickly glanced at in the comics an outstanding achievement from WETA Digital the same team who perfected Gollum in the Lord of The Rings and Snowy's emotions are so perfectly recaptured in the film to comic interpretation or at least as I see it!, The Score By John Williams is another masterstroke of film score genius his new themes are perfectly interwoven into the body of the film, it has always interested me that Tintin's theme is not given a full concert arrangement you hear the first few bars of it but that's it it never develops or changes other than the few notes you hear they are always the same notes that you hear every time Tintin is referred too you always hear the same tiny hints of Tintin's theme it's very quick and very sudden like 5 second variants of the same melody or theme there's one melody for Tintin a very quick theme which has always interested me why the main character does not have a fully developed theme in the film and the supporting characters in the film all have fully developed musical identifications Snowy the pirates the villains all have themes outstanding themes all the same which all have concert arrangements I really love Snowy's theme it's really fast like he's running along a garden path or a road that might be one of my favourite themes composed by John Williams it's so perfectly integrated into the character I can't not imagine seeing that character now without hearing his theme that's the outstanding gift of John Williams's music he composes music for the character and so the character becomes ingrained into the musical identity for the film so when we see him on the screen you hear or hum it straight away that's John's gift his skill he is the master of film music and an incredible asset to film scoring! I really love this film because it gives me a wonderful feeling inside of the fact that this is a wonderful family film and an underrated one at that the film was hated and dumped on by the hardcore fans of the comics because they just thought it was another Indiana Jones Film Don't listen to those stupid people they are wrong and stupid and quite pathetic to even suggest that this is just another Indiana Jones film it's not please give this a chance it deserves a chance to be loved and appreciated don't let it go down the same route as Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull did when it was forgotten about it does not deserve it, it should not receive such harsh negativity by anybody!",10,1,4,11 March 2016
Empire of the Sun," A Young Boy becomes a man in the Master of Film's most uplifting Masterpiece!
","After the unforgettable movie experience of the Color Purple the Master of Film has done it yet again with the most Heartbreaking, Glorious, Soaring, Uplifting, Inspiring and one of the most Unforgettable movie Experiences of my life it really is a soaring uplifting film of the human spirit and an inspiring coming of age adventure you feel uplifted and wonderfully inspired because the way in which the inspiring themes of the film are presented to in the patriotic direction the soaring uplifting score the wonderful redemption at the end when all hope seems to be lost and all hope is rediscovered and redeemed when the dreams and inspirations of Jim's new found life come true all because of a life changing experience of the horrors around him in the harrowing events of war because of one change one memory one moment that could all be slowly fading away really makes Jim wonder if his new found dreams are the right thing to do or does he help and look after the people injured and wounded? The Direction and Score tell the story of the film with the care and affection for the history it portrays it almost feels like a documentary not a film! Like the Color Purple the film has an idea a theme that runs through the whole film the theme of tolerance the idea of what are we prepared to tolerate and suffer in order to achieve the dreams we want the dreams we aspire to achieve the future of all man kind! I really feel strongly about the film as much as I do about the Color Purple they are underrated Masterpieces and do not get talked about any more among the Master of Film's filmography because they have not done well with awards or not gained the critical acclaim they deserve! Empire of the Sun is the Best Picture of 1987 for a number of reasons the inspiring themes of soaring airplanes and the dreams we all share the recurring motifs of memories that Jim has like the haunting melody that his mother plays on the piano similar to Celie and Nettie's hand clapping motif and song in the Color Purple which connects Celie and Nettie together the Haunting piano melody that Jim's Mother plays connects Jim to his mother he knows that he is safe and well and that is very powerful for me that a simple piano motif can bond and connect someone together! The film has a recurring theme of showing acts of malevolent evil and what the power of evil can and will do if necessary there are threats of danger and you see many sequences of danger and hurtful acts of evil which affects Jim and the people around him as the threat of evil increases and the hope decreases as Jim knows he feels anger for the evil around him but he never speaks his emotions the film shows it through the simple power of emotion and Jim's body language he really changes throughout the film he cares and respects all who know him he has a friend called Basie who he aspires to and when Jim explains the emotion of the heartbreaking experiences he has gone through throughout the war which are intertwined with the wonderful experiences of the planes soaring across the sky it feels heartbreaking and wonderfully overwhelming at the same time! Like the Color Purple you feel the overwhelming force of the ending as all hope is restored when the whole atmosphere of the whole world returns to normal no feeling of darkness peril or danger worries Jim at the end he is with his mother he is safe and well but there is a sense of traumatic memories that will never change the heartbreaking sequences of people reviving other people back to life which people should never have to do in the first place but they have to in order to survive the traumatic horrors of war! Last note I want to say that The Color Purple and Empire of the Sun are heartbreaking companion pieces and they need to be loved and appreciated more and we can share the Color Purple and Empire of the Sun with the world! Empire of the Sun is A Glorious Uplifting Adventure of the human spirit!",10,3,8,1 July 2015
Bridge of Spies," Steven Spielberg is back ladies and gentleman in this outstandingly entertaining thriller which moved me and affected me deeply well done yet again and bring on the BFG!
","Wow who would have thought after the absolutely outstanding Lincoln Steven Spielberg would deliver yet another outstanding film with Bridge of Spies I can't quite believe it to be honest and he is nearly 70 years old and he still knows how to make an outstanding piece of cinema just incredibly entertaining moving thrilling and quite honestly it's also touching and heartfelt at the same time, I have just viewed the film for the first time tonight with exceedingly high expectations because of the outstanding output from Steven Spielberg in the past and with this film he really delivers on the excitement the thrills the tension the gentle drama of the film is quite easy to see too it's not just a thriller in my eyes at least I did not see just a thriller I saw a fight for justice for compassion a fight for common sense in a time of political tension as the Cold War turned out to be and I thought the film was very considerate of the times the world was living in with regards to the costumes and the set design and the way the film was shot with tense colours and textures which is very true of the film, it's tense and exciting and when the end of the film comes you feel relieved that all the tension all the angst has gone away everyone has come to a peaceful resolution and that's a question I think the world needs to consider why can't the world come to some of sort of agreement into how to stop the threats that surround our world at this moment in time?, I'm not sure why it's so difficult sometime but hey ho back to the film, the film has an incredible sense of thrills and drama that is complemented by 2 very different performances by Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance Tom Hanks Plays James Donovan with extreme passion for his job and his loving family as he says in the film Everyone Matters he cares for his country and his wife very much and he feels satisfied when the exchange is negotiated with Russia and America he feels he's done the right thing, Mark Rylance on the other hand plays Rudolf Abel with a sense of relaxation a sense of calm my favourite lines in Bridge of Spies are when James Donovan asks whether Rudolf Abel feels worried and he simply replies would it help?, that's the sign of a fantastic script by Matt Charman with some help by the Coen Brothers amazing script and a fantastic debut script for a first time writer well done and I look forward to seeing his name on scripts in the future! Thomas Newman composes a fantastic score that fits the film although I wish it was John Williams's name on the film credits but ah well it's a shame but I expect we might have to see other composer's names on Steven Spielberg's films in the future in regards of John Williams's age! In conclusion Bridge of Spies is an outstanding return to film directing from Steven Spielberg, it's one of his very best in his recent film output up there with Lincoln most certainly and I am beyond excited to see him return to the fantasy genre with the BFG it's going to be quite something!",10,1,2,30 June 2016
Saving Private Ryan," Saving Private Ryan the greatest war film ever made thank you Steven Spielberg just thank you so much!
",Saving Private Ryan a film with more than 2 million reviews on this website so what more is there to say other than these words Thank you Steven Spielberg for telling this story to the world and making a memory for all of the world to cherish and remember till the day we all must die I mean what more can I say just unforgettable editing and incredible direction it is an incredibly powerful and restrained film and it is also a hauntingly beautiful requiem to all the men who fought for us so we could live our life's it is so haunting the opening 25 to 30 minute D-Day scene is so haunting and emotional it almost feels like it is June 6th 1944 today I am serious and the last 30 to 35 minutes are unforgettable both of those scenes are like bookends you have 1 huge set piece to begin the film and then you have 1 huge set piece to end the film the film starts with James Ryan as an old man and ends with him as an old man it is like a bookend. The Score by John Williams is haunting and restrained like the film and the film does not rely on the score so much but the Hymn to the Fallen is the most haunting piece of music I have ever heard and should be played at all remembrance services but is not why I have no idea! Just a unforgettable film and yet again like the Color Purple in the most unjust Oscars ever Saving Private Ryan Did not win best Picture Steven Spielberg won Best Director but what beat Saving Private Ryan to the Best Picture award Shakespeare In Love crazy and a disgusting unjust decision the worst decision the Oscars have ever made that and the Color Purple not winning Best Picture are just wrong decisions just wrong they knew they were the best pictures of 1985 and 1998 and they got it wrong so wrong the third time this has happened actually with ET losing to Gandhi in 1982 just wrong decisions! Anyway I want to finish by saying Thank you to Steven Spielberg and John Williams yet again you have directed and composed another masterpiece together and this film is a haunting and beautiful requiem for all the men who gave their life's for us and for that I hereby award this film Best Picture of 1998 even if the Oscars will not!,10,2,3,26 August 2015
1941," 1941 a really underrated movie!
","Why do people hate this movie? it has comedy and adventure and war spoofs and fun little parodies to a certain Spielberg film which I shall not spoil here just watch the movie! What can I say other than well done the Master of Film has made a really fun and entertaining world war 2 parody! The Master of Film does not use the seriousness of the 2nd world war he uses the fun aspects of the war he uses a lot of jokes to complement the fun of the film some of the jokes are tired and old but they make you laugh mostly John Belushi's jokes! The cast is all star there are loads of people in this movie I could waste a lot of time naming the people in this movie! John Williams's outstanding theme perfectly captures the spirit and tone of the movie, just something to bear in mind about John Williams's score for this movie even though the movie was not received well by critics John Williams still writes an incredible score for the movie even for Hook the same principle applies but I will talk about Hook when I get there! I mean I ask the same question again and again why do people hate this charming and really funny Movie? I mean the Ferris wheel scene is really funny with the characters screaming and laughing their heads off as they roll down the Ferris wheel! The Ballroom scene where the two men out for the female lead affections really escalates and climaxes into this big ballroom bash it is quite funny and really entertaining! And while all this is happening the army general is in the cinema watching Dumbo and having a ball of a time laughing and having a great time! The Script is really engaging and fun but, some people complain about the running time of this movie yes it is 2 and a half hours long but a Spielberg lover like me does not care one tiny bit! If you can find this movie anywhere please watch it! So it is not Jaws or Close Encounters of the third kind but it is a great Spielberg movie and needs a lot more attention!",10,0,4,20 November 2014
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," The Master of Film takes a romp through the jungle in this entertaining sequel to Jurassic Park!
",Now I want to start off by saying I enjoy this movie for what it is an entertaining romp through the jungle so please do not hate me for it is the film great and expertly made no it is a bad film or a poor film as everyone thinks no it is a decent entertaining sequel to one of the greatest films ever made and I Think Steven Spielberg needed to make this film after Schindler's List make the kind of film he enjoys making adventures entertaining romps for the audiences not for him for his audiences I enjoy the film for what it is a romp through the jungle The score is wonderfully appropriate for this film with the jungle percussion beats and the theme for the lost world itself is full of jungle sounds and drums I love the theme a lot the story yes is not fantastic but take it for what it is you care for the characters and the adventure this is not Schindler's List you know enjoy this movie for what it is a excellent romp through the jungle and give it a try you might like it you might not that's your opinion but I enjoy it I love the first 10 minutes with the little girl and her family and the cameo from Richard Attenborough as John Hammond and the kids Lex and Tim very quick cameo from Lex and Tim look out for it The film plods along at a slow pace which might bother a lot of people but it is OK as I say give it a try you might like it you might not Steven Spielberg has problems with it but that is not the case for me try it and see what you think with the Lost World For Me it is an entertaining romp through the jungle and you see those outstanding dinosaurs again what's not to like about that! John Williams composes another outstanding score it is a entertaining romp through the jungle try it out on a Friday Night Just Don't write it off!,10,9,16,19 August 2015
Schindler's List," The Master of Film pours his heart out in this heartbreaking and unforgiving memento for the surviving Jews!
","Steven Spielberg had already made Jurassic Park and blown us all away with the groundbreaking dinosaurs with Schindler's List he makes not a film but a memento a life lesson a historic important landmark a teaching resource which teaches the world about the Holocaust and the horrors it unleashed upon innocent people innocent people who did not deserve what they had to suffer through for no reason! I will tell you a story about how I discovered this landmark Masterpiece At School recently My teacher Simon Strange was teaching us all about the Holocaust and explaining what happened all those years ago and showed us a video and spoke in great detail about hatred and intolerance and crimes against humanity and he spoke to me and said I will never forget this conversation I know You love Steven Spielberg's Films very Much? I certainly do I said Have You seen Schindler's List Before? No I said I am too scared to watch it because of the subject matter I urge you to see this film Simon said to me I can't show this to you in school because it shows graphic imagery and things I can't show you but you need see this film now and all you need is a quiet room no distractions just peace and quiet and so I went home had Dinner watched the whole 3 hours and 15 minute film and I was speechless I could not speak even at the end I sat through the credits stunned at the horrors I saw on the screen the crimes and the hatred of the Nazis really affected me and I sat through the credits and after the credits had finished I cried I genuinely for 20 to 30 minutes because that was all I could do cry my emotions poured out of my heart and there was nothing I could do that was it tears were flowing down my face like a river because I felt angry that there was nothing I could do to prevent the Holocaust from happening it happened tragically and the film teaches us all about Intolerance Hatred and humanistic crimes of such appalling nature and how we all can overcome the horrors we face despite all the odds have been thrown against us I have never seen a more Important film in my life I Have never cried that much in my whole life after experiencing a film I still do now It happened again having just finished it an hour ago for this review I just can't believe the experience the film has given me every time I see it an emotional, empowering, important one!

Lincoln," Steven Spielberg dedicates a film to the greatest president America has ever had Abraham Lincoln in this incredibly important and moving film!
","After the beauty and the overwhelming tear jerking emotion of War Horse Steven Spielberg returned to a subject he loves very dearly and will always be a great passion to him America the country he calls home what Steven Spielberg has achieved with Lincoln is nothing short of a masterpiece of motion picture film making, Lincoln is a film of high importance partly thanks to the towering performance of Daniel Day Lewis who portrays the president with wit courage extraordinary power and incredibly understated quietness and calm still movements of his face and voice it is a performance for the ages as they say at the end of the film Abraham Lincoln will belong to the ages and the incredibly moving performance demonstrates that a performance can be given without overdoing it or going over the top it is a masterclass of acting and one that must be viewed in film schools across this world we all live in this film is such a important historical landmark and a dedication to a man who did the honourable thing the common thing the right thing the righteous thing a piece of history that must never be forgotten and now the film is out there in the world the film has the power to educate the next generation of our children on what intolerance means the burden it still carries to this day still to this day the 13th amendment was signed to abolish slavery to make it a necessary thing to oppose not to commit to to hate on to dispose of because it is a appalling act of injustice which to this day across the world hate crimes and acts of slavery are still be committed against black people and of colour and of different minority's! The film has a very moving message to send to the world and that is this Things that are equal to the same thing are equal to each other that's mathematical law that still something we all must abide by and attend to and although threats of hatred are still as dominant as they were when Lincoln was president shows a great divide almost a split between people's beliefs and opinions which must be shared the people's voices must be heard! Steven I want to thank you for making this film because it teaches me and also the world about an important part of American history but also a part of world history and the film has many rousing speeches regarding the American Constitution and the negativity of someone's actions whether they felt it was the right thing to do how do people react to people's judgements of certain agreements or disagreements and how the power of the right to a free democracy allows us all to make our own judgements ourselves regardless of other people's judgements what matters is your own! Tony Kushner writes an outstanding and witty script worthy of a stage play and the beautiful articulate words are complemented by a score of majesty grace and outstanding respect for the film it accompanies by the Master John Williams, outstanding horn solos complement the character of Lincoln in such a way that it never feels overwhelming to the film or the scenes that the music accompanies which are a very small number of scenes which benefits the film enormously and lets the film breathe which is a huge relief to certain fans of John Williams! Steven, Daniel, the entire cast of Lincoln which I have not got the space to mention and last but by no means least John thank you so much for using your creative talents to make and accompany a film of such high importance and courage I am moved to tears every time I hear the end credits suite at the end of this outstanding important moving unforgettable masterpiece of a film!",10,1,1,29 June 2016
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," wonderful imagination for children of all ages
","Tim Burton has made a wonderful remake of the 1971 film with Gene Wilder. The 1971 Movie was awful and was not I repeat not faithful to the book at all but this remake is more faithful to the book and more slightly atmospheric compared to the sunny positive message of the original. A few things I need to bring to light here, Johnny Depp's performance is a performance of comic genius and he is quirky and kooky and not too negative compared to Gene Wilder's weird strange performance. The Music and Songs Written by Danny Elfman which use the original lyrics from the book are all unique and styled differently. The Sets are extraordinary beautiful visual creations that make you want to go and visit the factory yourself. It is amazing the level of achievement in this movie is mind blowing. Last few points, People love the 1971 film why I do not know and will never understand, give this one a chance please kids will sit through it even at 110 minutes it never bores you never!",10,2,6,6 October 2014
War of the Worlds," Steven Spielberg frightens the world with this frightening action adventure thriller!
","After the lovely film The Terminal which I absolutely adore so much Steven Spielberg wanted to give his audience a wee bit of a fright and boy did he with this absolutely brilliantly scary action adventure thriller and it's a completely different film compared to Minority Report where that film took us to the future this film keeps the reality of the here and now as the focus of the film, the visual effects by the amazing magicians at ILM try to upstage the actors but in every film Steven Spielberg makes no matter what type of genre of film it is he always makes the characters the focus of the film because you have to relate to them otherwise it would be pointless to watch it otherwise, The direction of the film is simplistic and really understated which is a unusual direction for a science fiction film to take because Tom Cruise is the focus of the story he wants to protect his family even though he neglects his children at the beginning he starts to bond with them despite the brevity and complexity of the situation at hand the amazing visual effects are wonderfully scary and appropriately so because this is not ET or Close Encounters of the Third Kind these are aliens with destruction on their minds as the beautiful narration by the king of narration Morgan Freeman tells us in the beautiful bookends at the opening and closing of the film they are so stunningly simply directed with nature floating around the screen so beautifully simple it almost feels like a documentary film simple easy to understand, Compared to Minority Report Tom Cruise gives a really committed performance so does Dakota Fanning and Justin Chadwin they are amazing performances and need more film roles, John Williams's beautifully tense score is not used in the film very much there is a strong emphasis of the music on the soundtrack album I really love the themes for Ray and the Children John Williams composes because it's not an iconic theme it's background music to accompany the simple story the film is telling there's no theme to identify the music to the film but it was not necessary because there is a pulsating tension in the film as the music thumps along like a old 1950's movie just fantastically simple not too complicated! This film is way too scary for children 12A is the wrong rating for the film 15 is the right rating for the film it's a frightening traumatising experience and not for viewers with photosensitive epilepsy there are flashing lights going on and off all over the place and iconic frightening images Planes engulfed in Flames trains riding along a railway track engulfed in flames dead bodies floating along a river blood all over the road really frightening images more scary than Jaws in my opinion just a wonderfully frightening thrill ride, Thank you Steven Spielberg and John Williams yet again I am beginning to sound like a broken record just thanking the both of them repeatedly but they deserve it their unforgettable cultural impact and contribution to film and film music is unparallelled I mean every film is a masterpiece of genius and visual invention, I can't wait to see what Steven Spielberg achieves with Munich!",10,2,5,24 September 2015
Jaws," Come on it's Jaws!
","Steven Spielberg is the master of film and Jaws is not a Bad movie at all in fact it is the scariest film of all time! Roy Schneider Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw star as Chief Martin Brody, Matt Hooper and Quint who are on the hunt for a great white shark! This film set the standard for motion picture blockbusters today for goodness sake! Steven Spielberg is a director with one goal in mind making a really entertaining movie and he always delivers the goods in every movie he has ever directed! The scope of the movie is incredible you never feel bored despite the fact there are long stretches of time where you do not see the shark, but the tension in this movie is incredible partly due to John Williams's outstanding score and he won a Oscar for this simple theme and to think Steven Spielberg laughed when John played the theme for the first time on the piano! HA! I mean every single aspect of the entire movie is sheer perfection every frame of the movie is meticulously thought through, some of my all time greatest scenes in film are in this movie, The Indianapolis story, the Banter between Quint and Hooper, the Virginity joke that Quint says to Brody's Wife is comic genius, The Barrel Scene where Quint goes Hooper Hopper hurry up Hopper and Hooper says I'm Going in and they think they have captured the shark the music is going crazy the trumpets and horns are going at full speed and then it slows down when they know they have failed and they have to try again and who can forget the immortal line of this historic film we are going to need a bigger boat I mean come on that is the best line in film! And I have not yet mentioned the classic opening scene which you will just have to watch but people who have watched the film will know what I Am talking about and the jump scares in this film are really effective! If you have never ever seen this film buy it on DVD now you will not regret it and it is a great film to study in film studies!",10,2,4,19 November 2014
The Terminal," Steven Spielberg's most lighthearted and underrated film I really love this little light gem of a film!
","After Catch Me If You Can Steven Spielberg makes his most lighthearted film for a long time I love this lovely film about finding your destiny and discovering what you have missed out on in your life despite the fact Viktor Navorski is trapped in an airport until his country called Krakozhia sorts out the war in their country he has to discover and explore the world he inhabits like the passengers and staff who work on the Terminal Like Gupta and Enrique and Officer Torres who looks after border control and immigration control, When Viktor meets Amelia Warren played beautifully by Catherine Zeta Jones a beautiful romance starts to develop but it really doesn't flourish until the end when Amelia really understands why Viktor wants to go to New York so Viktor can get the last signature on a can of jazz photographs for his father who has died and Viktor has made a promise to his father that he will not break, That's why the film is so beautifully light and entertaining because it is never revealed until the very end of the film the Audience is kept waiting and asking why Viktor is so desperate to go to New York and when it is revealed why he wants to go to New York it tugs at the heartstrings I love the light positive messages of the story there are so many wonderful scenes and performances Tom Hank's performance is one of slapstick comedy and wonderful visual comedic looks or glances Stanley Tucci's performance is so deliciously evil as Frank Dixon but my favourite performance has to be Zoe Saldana as Officer Torres just really lovely and beautifully touching and really fun too she has a ball being funny in Immigration Control shouting Next Next all the time, but when she is with Viktor explaining the rules to him you can tell she really wants Viktor to succeed in his quest, So does Amelia in a way there's a lovely couple of romantic exchanges as she tries to ask him out to dinner and then she goes I can not believe I have just asked you out to dinner, Finally Viktor has Enough money to afford a Hugo Boss suit in order to take Amelia out to dinner in a lovely scene where the staff at the terminal pour drinks or juggle hoops it's a lovely scene and the scene where they declare their love for each other after Viktor constructs a beautiful fountain made out of diamonds for her is so beautifully romantic and stunningly heartfelt so poignant, when Viktor finally is allowed to leave the terminal and go to New York they exchange final romantic looks at each other when she Knows his guest is finally fulfilled is so beautiful and really sweet! The direction is so lovely you can see Steven Spielberg is enjoying making the film and the infectious charm comes through in the direction and the unforgettably lovely score by John Williams it is the best score by John Williams I think he has ever composed for a film it is perfection and the perfect musical accompaniment for the lovely tone of the film it is a lovely score with beautiful themes for Viktor and Amelia and the staff of the terminal played on Clarinet and Accordion just lovely and beautifully feel good and happy infectious too makes me happy If you do not feel happy after hearing the music for the film you have no heart and joy in you! The most happiest film Steven Spielberg has ever made just amazing and wonderfully feel good the sort of film you can watch on a Sunday Afternoon with a cup of tea and a biscuit just a lovely film really underrated and completely overlooked by everybody I love this film it is a lovely lovely film of joy and happiness Thank you Steven Spielberg for directing a lovely lovely film and most importantly Thank You John Williams for this lovely lovely infectious score, If you have not seen this lovely lovely film give it a try and enjoy the feel good charm the film infects on you, Love love this film!",10,1,3,21 September 2015
The Queen," Helen Mirren is the Queen!
","The Queen is a film charting the turmoil the royal Family suffered in 1997 around the time of (Spoiler) Princess Diana's Fateful car crash in Paris. That is all I will say about the story of the film. The acting is Oscar winning from every single member of the esteemed cast Helen Mirren, Michael Sheen, James Cromwell, Alex Jennings, Silvia Sims and Helen Mccrory. Alexandre Desplat's beautiful score completely moves you to a certain degree of patriotism for this country. I love this film it really gets me emotionally right down to the emotional sector of my body. Tears and Laughter they are the main emotions you experience for most of the film. I think this film is underrated and needs to be watched again and again.",10,0,0,6 October 2014
Munich," Steven Spielberg lets us reflect on the past and try to find a solution to hatred in this shocking beautifully unforgettable thriller!
","After War of the Worlds Steven Spielberg made us all reflect on the past and look into the future in this absolutely stunning recreation of events that should never ever have happened I am shocked to know that these cruel heartless terrorists killed innocent people for no justification no reason to kill they wanted power they thrived on power and glory even though the world seemed I find to Ignore it I think for a long time I may be wrong in that matter was there immediate action quickly enough could all this have been prevented sadly it was not prevented Maybe because of injustice maybe they felt they did not earn respect from us I do not know but what I do know and I indisputably will not stand for is intolerance of all people black white whatever we are all one in this world and that's in a way what Steven Spielberg is saying to us and questioning what do we need to do to stop moments of conflict unnecessary acts of terrorism that's the question the film poses to us what is the reason for hatred in this world, this world is very depressing at the moment I know the pain people will suffer to get what they want but the events portrayed here were shocking and intolerable and must never be inflicted on a human being ever just shocking the pain that thrives from death is just indescribable and I can not and refuse to accept that happened in 1972 it just terrifies me to think this is the world we live in the 21st century, a world of hatred horrible injustice and racism cruelty towards Palestinians and the Israelis in this case, Steven Spielberg directs the film with a maturity and a adult sensibility which I have never seen before from him, Yes Schindler's List had that Adult Sensibility but to portray acts of terrorism and interweave that into a compelling retelling of a true story is an outstanding achievement and once again as I keep saying a film like this shows Steven Spielberg's versatility and his unique ways of directing different kinds of stories without entering clichés, John Williams's score is one of beauty and reflective memories or recollections into the past just beautifully performed with a choral voice reminding you of the tragedy that unfolded, the themes for the reflective parts of the film are simply stunning in particular Remembering Munich A prayer for Peace and Hatikvah (The Hope) I must also mention the theme for the relationship between Avner and Daphna called Avner and Daphna just beautifully romantic and heartbreakingly tragic, the performances from everyone Eric Bana in particular was stunning simply stunning as Avner and Geoffrey Rush's performance as Ephraim also deserves a mention also! I want to thank Steven Spielberg for believing in himself to tell this story but also have the confidence to tell the events of the film as they happened and not tweak things for dramatic purposes just an outstanding effort from this incredible master of film, John Williams Thank you once again for composing a score of reflection and memories but also thank you for remembering the events of that tragic day in 1972 and the same goes to Steven Spielberg thank you for remembering the past and that now allows to look forward into the future with a determination to win the battle that lie ahead they will take time and a long time at that but still thank you so much for remembering the past and commemorating the victims who died in 1972 and this review is dedicated to the countless people who died in Munich!",10,0,0,24 September 2015
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Indiana Jones and the Wonderfully Entertaining Last Crusade The Master of Film's most Hopeful and Entertaining Indiana Jones Film!
","After the unforgettable movie experiences of the Color Purple and Empire of the Sun The Master of Film was back for the 3rd Indiana Jones Adventure and this Time Indiana Jones is bringing his dad along for the ride too in this entertaining wild adventure full of chase sequences great comedic foreplay and a wonderful central theme What is more important Life or Treasure? I love all the Indiana Jones adventures but this one is my favourite because of the beautiful David Lean style direction at the beginning with Young Indiana Jones and the race on the speeding train as the music escalates and rides along with the train the speed of the music the exhilaration as the chase picks up speed and pace as the music keeps going and going like the train the Music is the train at the beginning 15 minutes just relentless speed and exhilaration it is so forceful and fast very fast speeding along as the film begins! John Williams's wonderful fast paced score is My favourite of the whole of the Indiana Jones Series I love them all but there are many reasons the score is the best, the themes are all different and unique and like all John's scores they all represent a theme a idea a melodic identification for each character place props story or ideas and themes like redemption or glory or the film's message or the comedy banter between Indy's dad And Indy himself! The film successfully intertwines themes or overwhelming ideas of spiritualism or glory and redemption with a sense of fun and adventure and the human spirit being lifted soaring across the sky like in Empire of the Sun but this is not a drama but still it retains those themes from Empire of the Sun but presents them differently with the fun and adventure of Indiana Jones and his dad flying across the sky or on their motorbike as they flee the Nazis and the music intertwines themes for the Nazis and Indy and his dad ridding off on their motorbike to a scherzo for motorbike and orchestra wonderfully named and composed by John Williams! Sean Connery is the big star name here as Indy's father but Harrison Ford still has a whale of a time playing back and forth with Sean Connery it is a joy when they are on screen together they have 2 musical melodic themes one is fun and adventurous and exciting the other is more poignant and is more associated with the father because the relationship in the film is not as relaxed as it was before in a way the theme for the father is a memory or a motif for Indy's past or childhood it is very very patriotic but not sentimental or syrupy in any way shape of form it is a melodic theme an idea a memory a visit to the past! The film's message what is more important Life or Treasure is more of a spiritual message a spiritual ritual if you will a rite of passage and is very dominant at the end of the film the last 25 minutes is so important because the relationship heals becomes stronger after a wounded fractured past the relationship is severely broken down they are very condescending of each other making wisecracks puns you get the idea but by the end the film makes a poignant statement on the importance on family over treasure as Indy asks his father What did you find dad? Me? Illumination! the Holy Grail has recaptured their relationship and their bond is stronger more developed more tighter and their friendship is more kindly and forgiving to one another as they ride off into the sunset for the last time or so it seems? Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is the greatest adventure film of all time alongside Raiders of the Lost Ark and the overwhelming power of the ending makes it stand out with the adventure and the comedy and the fantastic 15 minute opening train scene!",10,2,3,1 July 2015
Jurassic Park," Welcome to Jurassic Park The Master of Film's most exciting masterpiece!
","After Hook which I love and everybody hates The Master of Film made the most exciting film of his career Jurassic Park What do I have to say that has not been said already in the 800 plus reviews on IMDb Just incredible I have seen this film more times than I can count It is so exciting and filled with adventure just an extraordinary piece of cinema One of the best films ever made John Williams's unforgettable score with the trumpets and fanfares I love this movie Sam Neil's performance as Alan Grant is fantastic as be bonds with Lex and Tim who are played by Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards Laura Dern as Ellie Sattler is wonderful Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm has all the best comedic lines I don't need to recite those for you but here are just a few but John if the pirates of the Caribbean breaks down the pirates don't eat the tourists what have they got in there King Kong just a few there Richard Attenborough as John Hammond is extraordinary he gives the best performance in the whole film Welcome to Jurassic Park spared no expense the petticoat lane scene I can Memorize off by heart Do you know the first attraction I ever built when I first came here from Scotland? It was a flea circus...Petticoat Lane. It was quite spectacular. Spared no expense. There was a miniature merry-go-round and a wee trapeze and a car-carousel... and a see-saw. They all moved, motorised of course, but people would say they could see the fleas. 'Oh, I can see the fleas, mummy, can't you see the fleas?' Clown fleas and high-wire fleas and fleas on parade. But this place..... I wanted to show them something they could see... and touch. an aim Not devoid of merit. The direction is spot on and so scary I can't not get scared of the dinosaurs I also love the first 20 minutes when everything is set up and the Mr DNA cartoon I really think it is the best aspect of the film for children and really educational I think the film is best enjoyed by children it is a fantastic family film despite the fact of the scary segments which are very few and far between The dinosaur's effects are mind blowing cinematic achievements Thanks to Industrial Light and Magic for their cinematic achievements and well done Michael Kahn for superb editing work the beginning 20 minutes and ending 20 to 25 minutes are outstanding examples of how to edit a film the End Credits music is outstanding and the ending scene is so perfect and the last line is perfection wonderful and perfect for the tone of the film too I think Mr. Hammond, after careful consideration, I've decided not to endorse your park. So have I. and the climatic roar of the t rex and then the film ends with the end credits music with everyone is reflecting no dialogue just John Williams's music that's it just score beautiful simple but effective piano almost like a memory for John Hammond and the visitors That is All I can say without giving anything away Just experience this action adventure masterpiece for yourself you will see what all the fuss is about Life will find a way!",10,3,4,9 July 2015
The Wizard of Oz," Most overrated movie ever!
","Mary Poppins Who Framed Roger Rabbit The Sound of Music Shrek Back to the Future all timeless family movies they do not get enough credit but the Wonderful Wizard of Oz (More like the wonderfully bad Wizard of Oz) is loved by all not by me! For the millionth time Channel 4 showed the film on TV this afternoon and I just had to see if my opinion would change but OH NO certainly not! Now I loved this movie when I was tiny but then I just went with the adventure of it all, now just a pile of rubbish with a vomit inducing performance from Judy Garland vomit inducing! The most clichÃ©d story in the world and really poor visual effects I mean a yellow slab is the yellow brick road! I can understand the reasons why everyone loves this film because they watched it as a child and then had to show their children straight away do not I repeat DO NOT show this to children they will be scarred for life and it will be your own fault! The constant singing is just enough to drive anyone with a brain mad we're off to see the wizard is sung over and over again repeatedly with no sense of pacing or movement! Dorothy is really whiny and annoying after a while! The Wicked Witch has always terrified me and will scare any children who watch this! Just do not watch this pile of vomit inducing rubbish it is 76 years old now everyone has suffered through this pile of vomit inducing rubbish enough! There is a better Oz film out there Oz the great and powerful from Disney which does not even need to be compared to this vomit inducing rubbish!",1,11,50,1 March 2015
