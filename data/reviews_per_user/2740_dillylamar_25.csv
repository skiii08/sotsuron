","Hitchcock delivers a deep, layered, thrilling, and enchanting film, with beautiful camerawork, cinematography, and shot design, and sequences of editing and directing that you may not believe are from 1958.

10 Cloverfield Lane," 10 Cloverfield Lane
","10 Cloverfield is a thriller about a woman who wakes up in an underground bunker, after a car crash, and is told by a man that the world is under attack, and she must stay with him. This film is a good thriller, simple as that. Not amazing, outstanding, or brillant, but very good. This film is filled with slights twists and turns in narrative and whom you are supposed to believe, but at the end the audience is hit with a huge twist. Some people may find this twist to ruin the movie, but I think the film's quality was heightened by it. Without the twist, the film would have been left at a more cookie cutter and generic level. Sure its bizzare, but it makes you question what just happend. With only three reoccurring characters in the film, two of them give standout performances. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was solid, and John Goodman was brillant as the prepared, ordered, yet psychotic man. The film sets a tone of isolation, but with a supsenful dark wonder of what the truth really is, and what's out in the world. The ending was rushed, but it still held up to the point where the film wasnt ruined",7,0,0,4 May 2020
Gravity," Gravity
","A tense, climatic, and stunning ride that is Gravity. The effects, visuals, sound, edting, and cinematography in this film are beautiful. This film is compact, and almost never derives from its focuses. The main Performance by Sandra Bullock is okay, but she is able qato carry the film well enough. The script is pretty bare, and it is predictable. Some may also question its realistic quality, but this film is of course not without flaws. The meaning of this film is the search for meaning in an a world where we are much more insignificant than we think. Instead of floating away, giving up and dying, she powers through making something of her life. This film is also about Ryan overcoming the loss of her daughter, and not being held back by it. The odyssey of a lonely woman overcoming fear, isolation, grief, and the odds. Visually and technically brillant, decently acted, predictable, written bare, but meaningful and throughly wondering and entertaining",8,0,1,11 June 2020

","While it may have an interesting concept and intriguing mystery, Unbrekable has nothing to say, as it uses its twist ending with falsify the idea of a sequel into viewers, to make them believe they've watched something important, when it reality they've watch a good concept go absolutely nowhere, by rushing its ending. This film, a supposed psychological thriller, is completely in lack of psychological obstacle, with rather just try to get by on wonder.",5,0,2,9 May 2020

Insomnia," Insomnia
","This 2002 film directed by Christopher Nolan is an underrated gem. Its setting, and cinematography feed into its isolation. A film about guilt, right or wrong, action and intent, and moral compromise. This film is edited well, along Christoper Nolan directing into a great way. Pacino gives a standout performance, and so does Robin Willams. Doorman's history of manipulating evidence based off his own personal opinion clouds his consciousness. His then accidental killing of his partner, furthers that, as he struggles with his distinction of action and intent. He then begins to suffer from Insomnia.

Zodiac," Zodiac
","David Fincher's Zodiac is a deeply intriguing film about the real life phenomenon of the 'Zodiac'. This film doesnt defer from the real case, and the thrilling twists still hit pretty hard. The performances are solid, and despite being very long (rightfully so) the film still paces itself very well. Fincher paid great attention detail, making sure he didnt miss any key information or happenings. It covers a lot of ground, yet still feels very rythmatic. Not a typical film detailing the investigation of a serial killer.",9,0,0,6 May 2020
Horrible Bosses," Horrible Bosses
","Horrible Bosses is a black comedy that is wild and crazy, yet not too far fetched, but most of all its darkly hillarious . Sure, the jokes dont always land and can be subject to a lot of unoriginal material, and a few times the film breifly slips into some generic tropes, plus the fibut overall, the film's insane yet somehow believable plot, takes full control, as the viewer is hit with such memorable characters and dialogue sequences, that make you wanna watch this film over and over again. Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, Colin Farrell, Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston, and Jaime Foxx all give their special talents to the film, as Horrible Bosses, delivers a dark and hilarious viewing. Although, Charlie Day is annoying.",7,2,2,21 April 2020
Full Metal Jacket," Full Metal Jacket
","Stanley Kubrick delivers a film that makes a huge statement about war, the dehumanization of man, the duality of man, and the descent madness. Full Metal Jacket is unlike any other war film, as it blends humour with the harsh reality of what war does to a man. It is a film of two halves, both showing the decension into madnes, how man becomes an animal, and how psychologically tortured a man is, after boot camp and actual war. Full Metal Jacket really isnt about the Vietnam war, it is about the loss of indulviduality and human quality, to fit a system, which can be applied to more than just this specific topic. Kubrick'w use of Black humour is perfect. As the drill instructor degrading of the recruits in the first half of the film, shows the glamorfication of the destruction of a man's humanity. The second act shows the duality of 'Joker', as he represents the duality of man, by maintaing some of his indulviduality, but with killer instincts. At the end of the second act, he kills a young girl, causing him to now lose his humanity, pulling him into his molded form of programmed killer. 'Pyle'' and 'Animal Mother', display the theme of the duality of man as well, as 'Pyle' was coming close to becoming the ultimate marine, 'Animal Mother', but ends up killing Sgt. Hartman, and himself. While 'Animal Mother', was what he was on the way to becoming. A killer with sense of individuality or humanity. This film operates on many thematic levels. Also showing man becoming what it hates, and descending into its evil side. Technically, this film is great, with stellar cnematography and editing, along with the soundtrack.
The performances are great, especially the realistic portrayal from R. Lee Ermey. Full Metal Jacket also has a theme of childhood, teenage years, and cultural influence. As well the idea of connection between sexual frustration and violence. This film could be perceived as Kubrick's critique of old fashioned american ideals and culture. Essentially, the marines are brainwashed, and Hartman uses things like Religon, sex, and the marines. The use of religon to justify killing, the use of sexual insults to implement frustration, to then awake violent urges, and connect violence and sex. Like Full Metal Jacket is a masterpiece. Stanley Kubrick is genius",10,0,0,30 April 2020
Nightcrawler," Nightcrawler
","Nightcrawler is a realistic and dark film about a sociopath turning a smaller buisness into an eventual larger business, by filming and manipulating gruesome crimes, in order to put them on the news, glorifying and instilling fear into the people. He does whatever it takes to get what we wants, innocent's dying, manipulating a womens career, almost setting up a brutal crime, by withh olding information from the police and allowing his 'employee', to be killed. This film touches on the subject how news glorifies brutality, and how big corporations and the people part of them, will do whatever it takes to achieve higher, touching on the major theme and subject of the evil side of capitalism. Lou Bloom, searches for power, but also for meaning. He is a sociopath, and doesn't connect with or like people, and find his true place to grasp power and manipulate, through his news company. This film explores the worldview of capitalism, as Lou is a white male manipulating his minority employee, as he also explicitly states that the news wants urban crime leaking into the suburbs as stories, to instill fear. The cinematography, editing, lighting, and framing are dark, gritty are perfectly fitting. The script is brillant. Lou Bloom speaks like a person imitating a real person, and uses his false charming and manipulative words to lure his employee and Nina into his game. He has no formal education, he says he spends time on his computer trying to learn new skills and take in knowledge, in order for him to excel, as he speaks facts and demands with no understanding of any human elements behind them. He doesn't understand buisness ethics and doesn't know to function in society. The score is meant to be taken as it is from Bloom's perspective, as he believes that he truimphat, after manipulating a dead body into view of his camera. And at first, the audience is tricked into rooting for Bloom. Ome of the film's essential themes, is that us, the audience, lets bad people rise to power because they give us things. That the ones will all the power were the ones willing to do anything, and step on anyone to do it. This is implied by Nina a few times in the film, and the film also shows corrupt capitalism and its connection to racism. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is amazing. The film's major theme is that it exposes the spirit of capitalism, and what the human spirit becomes in America. A character like Lou, who is disconnected from society, who probably wasn't correctly diagnosed, and gets all of knowledge through the internet and self help books, arrogant, emphatically bare, demanding and and succeeds through that. As this film takes the more realistic look at the underdog to riches story, and removes the downfall, as in Lou's case, he's only going to get more poweful. He is clever, with a learned and false sense of niceness. And in the beginning, Gilroy makes the audience almost feel sorry for Lou, with traits of likeable not relating to morality. The problem isnt Lou, the problem is the society that rewards him. The advantages of sociopathy in a capitalist society.",9,1,1,20 May 2020
American Psycho," American Psycho
","American Psycho is a 2000 film directed by Mary Harron, adapted for the screen by Mary Harron, and based off of the novel of the same name. This film is a cult classic, as it's dark humor, ridiculousness, bloody violence, horror film traits, and insanely quotable moments mix well with its satire and criqie of collective identity, individuality consumerism, capitalism, and yuppie culture. Bale's breakout performance in the film is absolutely phenomenal and iconic. The main themes of the film are lack of individuality, collective identity becoming personal identity, the greed and self indulgence of those in high society, and what a psychopath can get away with in a world like this. All of the men on Wall street look and act the exact same. They are interchangeable, as are the women. That's why people constantly get names mixed up in the film, and that ends up saving Bateman. Bateman only cares about other view him. He is in a constant hunger for conformity and to be seen as better, as he ends up killing Paul Allen because he had a better business card than him. He has been killing for a long time, and has been able to maintain, but starts to breakdown. The film is about how we form a collective identity, pretty much losing our individuality and personal identity. We crave attention, material wealth, conformity and to be seen as better. Bateman does. So do the others. At the end of the film he realizes that nothing including himself really matter, everyone is the same. He is so indulged in a collective identity, that his lawyer mistakes him for someone else, obliterating his confession. No one cares that he kills people, no one even notices. He can get away with anything, even if your a serial killer/psychopath. because he has sold himself a collective identity. He puts value into material things like restaurants, suits, watches, cards, and apartments. He listens to cheesy pop music because its trendy, but much more value into it, than it really holds. He views the homeless and lower classes to be less than him, he just kills them. In this type of high society, the people lose their individuality and distungishable traits, and just become greedy, power hungry, emotionless, interchangeable and unoticable nothings. The only difference between Bateman and his banker colleagues, is that he kills people. But everyone is so wrapped up in themselves and collective identity, that they dont notice. Bateman sees women as meat or objects, and men as something to be better than.At the end of the film, after his breakdown, Bateman realize that he and everyone else he knows is meaningless, interchangeable, and that he can get away with anything. He can Indulge in his murderous hunger all he wants. He presents himself in the collective identity, fitting in losing all sense of self. It will go on. He becomes more and more hungry and uncontrollable and his private life becomes integrated into his professional, and he realizes that he take it, and get away with it, there is more to take. Don' become a Patrick Bateman. He craves to stand out and be better. His view of himself is skewed by his psychosis, inflated ego and sociopatheology. His fantasy and reality become jaded, mixed, and goes insane because he can't really tell the difference. His killings all happend, but some are partial truths, or over aesthetically elaborate type chainsaw massacre killings. He so disconnected and detached from reality.",10,0,0,24 June 2020
Face_Off," Face/Off

It's crazy and unique plot, its absolutely hilarious and bizzare humour, it's over the top yet skillfully filmed action scenes, its touching elements of family and loss, and it's great vice versa performances from John Travolta and Nicholas Cage. Its epic, wild, thrilling, and throughly entertaining. It's a great mix of action, drama, and corny/bizzare comedy, that proves amazing in the end",10,0,0,26 May 2020

The Pianist," The Pianist
","The Pianist is a brilliant crafted, brutal, realistic, and torturing film depicting a man struggle for survival during the holocaust, as he is seperated from his family. This film was a hard hitting film that really gets to feel the psychological torture and desperation of the main character. While it also depicts a harsh reality of the Jewish life during holocaust. The Pianist is stunningly directed film, with harrowing cinematography, as well as great costume design. The Pianist explores tones of both melancholy and depression, as well desperation, and fear, with only a few glimmers of hope. Adrein Brody gives a stellar performance, while providing his greatest moments when he isnt even speaking. His desperation and fear is prominent in his performance. While it may ponder in its narrative for a few breif moments, The Pianist is an excellent film and cinematic landmark. It's a haunting and depressing film you won't forget",10,0,0,29 April 2020

","Kubrick delivers a utterly amazing and ferociously enchanting final film of his career, that can be interpreted in so many unique ways, due to its extreme depth, constant metaphors, and the blurred idea of reality and dream.

Tombstone," Tombstone
","Despite the fact that's its tedious, generic in its writing and plot structure and subplots, charestically undeveloped, and like an extended episode of Bananza, Tombstone has a entertaining nostalgia in it, with a great perfomance by Val Kilmer. But that's not enough to overcome its generic and stale nature. It resorts to the played out tendencies of adding emotion kickback at the very end. Script is very restrained and generic",5,1,2,21 June 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Jojo Rabbit
","Taika Waiiti delivers a hilarious, tragic, and heartwarming film, depicted the idea of learning through kindness, struggle, and love. The film has surprisingly split critics, and some of them have considered it 'conversational'. However, the film despite depicting the experiences of a 10 year old in hitler's youth army during a horrible time, comes off still to be lighthearted. The film executes the idea of being brainwashed into hating very well, with great performances both comedic and dramatic, as well as a great script and beautiful cinematography, with costume and set designs achievements as well. Overall, Jojo Rabbit, is a comedic, heartbreaking, yet heartwarming film about perceptions. It proves to be crucial in the current moments of modern society",8,0,1,26 April 2020

The Social Network," The Social Network
","David Fincher directs 'The Social Network'. A film detailing the events of Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg creating the social networking site that would become known as Facebook, and how he is sued by the twins who claimed he stole their idea, and by the co-founder who was later squeezed out of the business. This film is a very well made and captivating film. The performances from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield are stunning standouts. Fincher directs this film in a great way, as its riveting score, excellent editing, and cinematography, give this film which doesn't necessarily deal the darkest of subjects, a somewhat intense and dark aesthetic to it. The script is brillant, as this is a film that relys heavily on dialogue, so the script had to be great. This film deals with true events, leaving it no room for narrative creation, but it still packs a heavy punch. As this film is relevant, important, sophisticated, engaging in every way, and depicts the relations of business and ideas, and the choices that lead to the future. The film really explodes in a good way when the arguments over rights and business opportunities happen between Zuckerberg and Savrin. Jesse Eisenberg turns the character into someone you'd love to hate, yet cant quite seem to, as he is a very sensible and intelligent asshole. The dialogue is slick and powerful, and the way the past and at the time present is interwoven together is masterfully crafted and structured. This film is razor sharp in many ways. The film is not intense in the usual way, but more through dialogue and the emotion of characters. And in the end, Mark Zuckerberg realizes his petty nature. The film is about relationships and freinds and what they mean in the digital age. He feels bad for screwing Eduardo, and using him. Mark spends most of the film attempting to distinguish himself. Eduardo saw through Sean's facade, while Mark didn't. Mark is just trying to make Facebook the best that it can be, until the end, he does the first human thing of the entire film, and reaches to someone, expressing remorse. Or, it could be seen as Mark revealing his shallow nature, and depicting his isolation, even though he has money and power.",9,0,0,11 May 2020
