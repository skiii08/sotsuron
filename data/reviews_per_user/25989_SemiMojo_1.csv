The Blair Witch Project," Uniquely mind-blowing experience
","Days after seeing the Blair Witch Project and its come to me that my recollections of the movie seem like it was something that happened in a dream. This was a nightmare, there are several scenes in Blair Witch that are comparable to the way a dream would carry out. It also carried with it a sense of infinite realism, just like the way everything in a nightmare would seem real in its context, the movie had me in that same zone. Everything was real and I was right there with the characters terrified at what was going to pop up around every tree they crossed in those woods.  Blair Witch had me weirded out, I came out of the theatre totally dis-orientated. Over the past week my friends and I have been tossing theories, clues, and interpretations around - every time I feel the hair stand up on my arms. For me it was how it seemed like a nightmare that captivates me, for others I've talked to its other aspects of the movie - all of which are exciting. Blair Witch Project is so out there because it is so in here, in our minds, it has captured a part of my mind untapped by any movie I've seen before it. It's incredible that a movie could have made me think like this, Blair Witch Project is truly an experience unlike any other.",10,1,2,10 August 1999
