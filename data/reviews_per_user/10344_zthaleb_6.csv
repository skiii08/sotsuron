Casablanca," A Classic
","Casablanca is the all time classic love story (besides Romeo & Juliet). The romance in this movie has everything. For people watching this movie for the first time without knowing anything about it will be shocked to see what happens at the end. I know I was the first time I saw this movie! At first it upset me because I wanted there to be a happy ending, but after realizing what Rick had done for Ilsa it made me so happy! The acting was amazing in this; very believable and very smooth. I think Humphery Bogart was really amazing in this movie. He played his character very well and made the character relatable! His character did a lot of developing in the movie as well! I would recommend this movie to any one! Such a great film!",10,2,3,29 April 2013
The Grapes of Wrath," Great acting
","The Grapes Of Wrath is a heart warming story about a family trying to pick up the pieces after being run off their land in Oklahoma. I really enjoyed watching this movie and trying to see what happens to the family as the movie goes on. What really stood out to me was how well the actors worked together. They really made a great family, as I was watching it I kept having to tell myself that this was not a real family and they were all actors but I also kept thinking about how thus has actually happened before. I feel like I could really feel what the actors were feeling because they did such a great job expressing them. This movie was really easy to watch and had a lot of feeling in it and I really enjoyed it.",7,0,1,10 May 2013
Annie Hall," great film
","This film was really enjoyable to watch! I love how everything was filmed and how it went back and forth between different time periods. I think that really kept me interested to see how things played out. This was the first Woody Allen film that I watched and I have to say that I actually want to see more. I loved the way that he filmed everything, I loved his sense of humor, and I even loved his acting. I really enjoyed how the movie did not have the happiest of endings because sometimes that is the case. I think the Woody Allen showed a real relationship and how sometimes they are not all fun and games but sometimes not agreeing and fighting. Most people like to see a happy ending play out by the end of the movie but sometimes it is nice to get hit with a bit of reality and realize that we are just watching a movie and not everything is always perfect..and I think that this movie is a great example of that.",7,0,0,10 May 2013
The Graduate," Comedy
","This movie is a great classic comedy from the 1960's. Even though this film is funny it has a great story and great lessons. I also think that this film summed up the sixties perfectly. I think this movie has a funny way of answering everyones question: what do you do after you graduate college? The movie plays with a huge love triangle, which always makes things a lot more complex. Through out the movie you see the main character Ben Braddock, played by Dustin Hoffman, realize that he is making the transition into adulthood. I think that Mike Nicolas did a great job making this movie hilarious. A lot of people are scared of making that transition into adulthood but I think that this movie put it really lightly and made it super funny. I enjoyed watching this movie and I would recommend it to anyone who just wants a good laugh!",7,0,0,10 May 2013
Singin' in the Rain," An all time favorite
","Singin' in the Rain has always been one of my favorite musicals. It is a automatic pick-me-up for me. The fun upbeat songs will instantly put you in a fabulous mood and the dancing makes you just want to get up and dance. Gene Kelly is so great in this movie, his character is hilarious and Kelly really brings him to life. The plot of the movie is really great too; there is never a dull moment in the film. Another things that really adds to this movie is all the bright colors. Everything in this movie is bright: the set, the costumes, even the makeup was a little on the bright side but I absolutely love it. I might be a little bias since I love musicals but I think for someone who does not like musicals this would be a great one to ease into, just because of its humor and happy messages.",10,0,2,2 May 2013
Psycho," loved this film
","This movie is a great horror movie! I was hiding behind my blanket the entire time and I loved every second of it. I am so glad that I finally had the courage to watch it. The storyline is great and totally unexpected. I always heard people talking about this movie saying how amazing it was and how it was a classic slasher film, so going into it I thought it was a typical slasher film. Little did I know there was a twist at the end, the name Psycho really suits the movie. Bates who is played by Anthony Perkins is the perfect 'psycho', he played crazy so well. The dark sharp music definitely added to how scared I was! As much as I hate being scared, I loved this movie!",9,0,0,10 May 2013
