Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Snore......
","I absolutely LOVED Vol. 1.  Made sure i watched it right before I went to see Vol. 2.So I am expecting to see some action and within the first 20 minutes or so I am already complaining that I am bored. Next thing you know I wake up and shes being hog tied by Bud, then I fell back asleep.When I awaken from my little snooze, Uma and Daryl are fighting (about the most exiting thing during the whole movie, but COMPLETELY over acted by Daryl).I don't remember much after that (i think i fell back asleep)Washing my hair was more exciting then Vol. 2Would love to comment more on the movie, if it had kept me awake....Should i get semi excited about Vol. 3 (in about 10 years)
Maybe.. BeeBee and Nikki will have it out?",1,21,41,26 April 2004
