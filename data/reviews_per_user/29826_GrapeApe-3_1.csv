The Blair Witch Project," Snoozefest
","I've seen episodes of Unsolved Mysteries that were scarier. Interesting? Yes but certainly not the scariest movie since the Exorcist. Why should I pay to see a movie that does not answer the questions it asks. Why was Mike standing in the corner? Cheap ending, cheap movie, Don't believe the hype. They could have done plenty to make you wet your pants but instead they resort to whispering in the dark and shaking their tent. Snoozefest.",4,0,2,3 August 1999
