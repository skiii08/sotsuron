Walk the Line," 'Walk the Line' is an excellent display of the life of Johnny Cash.
","Joaquin Phoenix plays the role of Johnny Cash excellently. Phoenix displays exact characteristics, with absolutely no flaws. Reese Witherspoon plays the role of June Carter Cash excellently, if not more excellent that Phoenix.This film has proved that Hollywood can bring stories to life without adding special effects. Although Walk the Line does not contain any special effects, it is still captivating by the story it tells.Young Cash experiences hard life when his elder brother is killed in a mill accident. He also experiences abuse...physically and mentally. His father continuously tells Cash that he is 'nothing', and that as long as he considers music as his future, he will remain 'nothing'.June Carter Cash, played by amazing actress Reese Witherspoon, follows Cash in almost every way she can. She helps him through his deepest hear aches, and helps him fight his infamous addictions.Through bad times and good, J.R. Cash and June C. Cash stick together, and don't let go of each other until the end.",10,1,2,10 December 2005
