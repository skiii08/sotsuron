Requiem for a Dream," Spoilt by the last ten minutes
","While the quality of the performances here is extremely high, the film betrays them with its absurdly OTT ending that just makes you find the whole thing pat and exploitative, rather than the thoughtful and humane movie it is until that point. Would Ellen Burstyn's character really have been treated that way, and with such lack of compassion? And likewise Jared Leto's? The ending sets out to be as unpleasant as possible,with the same kind of mentality as a Farrelly brothers gross-out, sacrificing credibility and alienating the audience from sympathy with characters who now just aren't real. What a waste.",Null,0,0,23 February 2002
Shakespeare in Love," Was Shakespeare really so straight?
","This film annoys me - and not just because it feels like a smug, obvious, feature-length episode of Blackadder. What winds me up is its shallow, lazily populist heterosexism, so out of keeping with the subversive play of gender and sexuality that Shakespeare's comedies celebrate. The subtext of the film, though it's hardly sub, is that the relationships within the theatrical group (where boys play girls) are only pretend, unsatisfactory, incomplete - and that for genuine romantic love, only true heterosexual relationships will do. The film charts Shakespeare's supposed education in this. The irony of the suggestion that Gwyneth Paltrow's character ultimately inspires Shakespeare to create Viola in Twelfth Night, perhaps the most gender-bending of all Shakespeare's plays, seems lost on the movie.
This crass reduction of Shakespeare's daring, inclusive art, and its translation of of a sexually complex playwright's life into something quite the opposite of what he stood for, is all the more surprising coming from the scriptwriter: Tom Stoppard. Stoppard wrote a fantastic play about A E Housman called 'The Invention of Love' which is as subtle and sympathetic an examination of sexuality as you're likely to find.",Null,0,1,19 February 2002
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A counter-productive allegory
","Has the film downplayed the book's Christian allegory? Lewis's intent is still strikingly clear on screen. You get a hint of his dubious 'Lord, liar, or lunatic' trilemma from the Professor before the children even get through the wardrobe; and Edmund's temptation by Turkish Delight could be construed as a dangerous flirtation with Islam. But it's in the parallels of Aslan with Christ in the second part of the film that things get really obvious. The lion has his own Garden of Gethsemane moment before going off to be sacrificed instead of the sinful 'son of Adam', he is humiliated before being killed, his body is tended by two weeping women, and then he rises from the dead.Lewis's intention was to prepare children's minds for reception of the Gospel by casting it in an adventure story, but surely there's a danger here. If you present Christ's sacrifice and resurrection in terms of magical fantasy, don't you make it more difficult for children to make the leap to understanding the New Testament as fact rather than just another parallel myth? The other key problem is that there is no logic to Aslan's passion: there's some mumbling about the 'deep magic' requiring that the Witch have a sacrifice, but I would struggle to explain to a child WHY it was required, or how this deep magic could be a force of absolute good. Rather than making the Christian message easier to assimilate, Lewis's tale just makes it seem confusing.",7,1,7,9 December 2005
Spider-Man 2," No match for the Superman sequel
","So, this is Â‘the best superhero movie of all time', is it? That's the absurd line being peddled by a number of UK critics. So where are the truly memorable set-pieces: the Eiffel Tower elevator, Niagara Falls, the arctic ice palace? Where are the villains who are actually bad, rather than temporarily misguided, and who you actually have any interest in seeing killed? I'm talking about Superman 2, of course. This second Spider-Man movie is a slight improvement on the woeful trash of the first, but it's still banal, joyless, forgettable tripe; it's the kind of perniciously inane summer fodder that seems to lower the IQ of anyone who sees it. And the idea that we need a third one of these, with the guy in the goblin costume again, just beggars belief.",Null,0,0,22 July 2004
Lost in Translation," Damned by excessive praise
","If I had seen this film knowing nothing about it, it might have made a better impression on me. But with the world's critics having gone into such swooning raptures over it, the actual experience cannot but disappoint. It's just a mildly diverting, well-played, low-key little film, that doesn't outstay its welcome. The most baffling reviews are those which claim it's 'hysterically funny': it simply isn't, maybe raising just the odd smile.Anyone in the UK who saw the final episodes of 'The Office' over Christmas will find the ending of this film familiar, and I'd be surprised if many people find this version more rewarding or moving.",Null,0,0,15 January 2004
Bridget Jones's Diary," Misogynistic candyfloss
","What a wretched film this is - I'm not sure if the book is as bad, or whether it took special effort to make such a shallow, lazy piece of fluff with such obvious contempt for the audience of 'middle youth' females whose buttons it thinks it can push.What's depressing from the film's commercial success in the UK is that it obviously DOES push the right buttons. The whole concept of the movie is to get clearance on the most cliched 'classic' love and disco tracks ('that'll get the girls laughing/swooning/crying!', you can hear the makers tittering smugly to each other), and then use the film as an extended music video with Renee pouting vacuously and pratfalling about over Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. WHY do women tolerate being so condescended to?",Null,0,0,22 December 2001
Cold Mountain," Miramax strikes again
","This is yet another vacuous, overlong, prettified Miramax adaptation of a semi-literary novel. For someone who's supposedly been reduced to destitution, Nicole Kidman always looks to have a hair stylist on hand, and at one stage I could swear she's wearing tinted contacts. The cynicism of this type of film-making, throwing in as many sops to the Oscar voters as possible (a bit of 'hard-hitting' cruelty to lend a spurious air of seriousness, a Philip Seymour Hoffman 'character' role, etc), shows sheer contempt for the audience. Please avoid.",Null,3,4,15 January 2004
Spider-Man," Utter trash
","No, sorry - this is not, as critical consensus seems to insist, a 'great new kind of superhero movie, with interesting human characters': it's violent, boring mindrot existing only to product-place beer and soda. Superman 2 - that was a good superhero film, with great villains, a proper plot, and genuine human interest. Spider-Man has none of these elements, and as such is completely useless as entertainment. I'd rather sit through 'Batman and Robin' again than this.",Null,0,0,11 July 2002
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Chinese Junk
","Nearly every critic in the UK seems to have taken leave of their senses over this film. Just because it's in a foreign language, there's an infuriating sycophancy which assumes it must have some genuine arthouse kudos. RUBBISH! This film is stunningly average, with the impressive visuals only just stopping the excruciating dialogue and wooden acting from making it unwatchable. The storyline would be dismissed as childish and stupid by a programmer of Mortal Kombat. 'Sense & Sensibility with martial arts?' - what are these critics thinking? If ONLY there were some of Jane Austen's craft and wit about this. Go and watch the BBC version of Pride & Prejudice instead.",Null,0,0,16 January 2001
Million Dollar Baby," Karate Kid with an 'issue'
","Following the template set by Mystic River, Clint Eastwood turns in another overlong, murky, shallow film concocted more for the dulled palates of Academy voters than with any intention of entertaining or stimulating its audience. For the first two thirds, it's just Karate Kid all over again - hopeless young wannabe persuades elderly pro to train them, wax on/wax off, becomes champion fighter. Then we get the euthanasia bit tacked on to the end, without any genuine attempt to tackle the complexity of the issue. Not least of which is the legal position - at the end, would Eastwood's character really have been allowed to just slink away without any repercussions? Morgan Freeman is the same character he has been in every film since Shawshank, there is a desperately flat, 'humorous' subplot involving a Cletus-like cretin in the gym ... the movie needed putting out of its misery long before it got the greenlight.",4,1,5,26 September 2005
Mulholland Drive," Stunning - Lynch's best movie to date
","What a treat this movie is, after all the tat like Harry Potter in the last few months: a mesmerizing adult film with great performances, script, score, editing and direction.Some people hate this film - they think it's pretentious, and has no narrative drive. Well it's certainly languid, until the last 20 minutes, but if you were a fan of Twin Peaks (both the TV series and Fire, Walk with Me) then Lynch's trademark hypnotic style is hugely enjoyable to experience again. As Kubrick did, he appreciates the significance of silences. Speaking of Twin Peaks, it's good to see the same dwarf (not speaking backwards this time - Lynch is getting too mainstream!), and some other resonances: despair beneath an idyllic veneer, characters with cryptic messages (compare the cowboy with the log lady) and a fabulous Badalamenti score.The final part of the film, from Club Silencio onwards, is a series of exhilarating gut-punch twists that will take at least two viewings to get your head around fully, and Lynch has 'helpfully' given a series of clues to the mystery to watch out for the second time round. This is not, in any sense, a forgettable movie.",Null,1,2,29 January 2002
War of the Worlds," The end of the Worlds
","Three things particularly puzzled me about *War of the Worlds*.One is the strange chronology of events. As the film opens, the first inkling of anything amiss are a few reports on the news of power outages in Ukraine. When the tripod emerges in New Jersey, there is no reason for us to think that any have yet struck elsewhere. And yet within just a few hours, we hear people talking about battles around the world as if they have been going on for weeks: and this when all sources of communication are supposedly down.The second puzzle is what the purpose of Tim Robbins is. This is a larger philosophical issue, not a casting query.The third is how Spielberg and the scriptwriters ever thought they could get away with the ending. Why does the boy need to survive when all plot logic dictates that he should be dead or missing? It shows such total contempt for the audience that I'm staggered Spielberg ever let it cross his mind, let alone film it and put it in the final cut.",4,1,1,22 July 2005
