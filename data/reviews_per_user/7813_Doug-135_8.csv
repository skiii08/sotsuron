Casablanca," Unforgettable.
","Thank goodness this movie isn't associated with a specific holiday or it would be as over-played as 'It's a Wonderful Life.' Members of the cast and crew have said that working on this picture was just like any other - no one had any idea that it would go on to become such a classic. Even while shooting it, changes were being made - the famous ending where Claude Rains and Humphrey Bogart walk off into the fog was not in the original script. (TV's The Simpsons even featured an alternative ending in one of their shows!) The plot involves wartime refugees gathering in Morocco hoping to obtain scarce exit visas to Lisbon. All of the elements - production, story, music, script and direction are woven together to create a motion picture masterpiece. But more than anything it is the rogues gallery of supporting players that makes this picture so memorable.",10,0,0,8 March 2001
Citizen Kane," This is one of the best movies ever made.
","Listed as one of the best movies ever made and #1 on the American Film Institute's list of greatest movies, this is a remarkable movie for a number of reasons. Wells made this movie when he was only in his mid twenties! RKO studio's gave him full run of the studio's facilities, yet he'd never made a movie in his life. Most of the cast were friends of his from his radio days in New York. The obvious real-life Kane, William Randolph Hearst,  did everything in his (considerable) power to stop the movie. He nearly succeeded. Refusing to show the movie at any of his theaters, it was could only be seen at a few RKO movie houses. Had the movie played on more screens at its release, it would have been much more successful. Wells won an Oscar for the screenplay (his only one) but credit must be shared with Herman Mankiewicz.",10,1,3,9 March 2001
Memento," Keeps your interest from end to beginning.
","What a refreshing movie. The film makers actually expect us to think! One caution though, go see this one with a friend, because there is no way you can figure it all out yourself. It's one of those movies where, for the next few days after you've seen it, small things will come back to you and suddenly whole segments of the plot will make sense. Repeated viewings are a must.",9,0,1,12 June 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," As good as or even better than the first!
","First let me say that any movie is bound to be a pale imitation to the book version. But so far (two out of three) these epic movies are pretty darn good. This one didn't spend any time getting us up-to-speed, it just took off and for three hours, never stopped. The CG Gollum looks quite believable, and I loved the ents. Of course see the movie, but if you have not read the books, make that your priority. The sense of dread, the weariness of the journey and the depth the darkness and the vastness of the woods only comes across thru reading the books and using your own imagination.",9,0,0,18 December 2002
Driven," Do they give awards for the loudest movie?
","What a mess. There isn't enough here to make a decent music video, let alone a full length motion picture. What happened to the characters? The story? Of course if there was a story, you couldn't hear it over the overblown background noise and loud music. I'm still trying to figure out what, in an empty stadium, can make so much noise??? Gena Gershon was a total waste, same with Burt Reynolds. The best acting came from Til Schweiger, and he sure didn't set that bar any too high. The one scene where they go racing through downtown Chicago was fun. But come on, after the two finally stop, they just stand there and have a nice leisurely chat on the shoulder of the road and no police? Plus, are these cars just sitting there with the keys in 'em waiting for a joyrider to come along and just drive them off? One last question, I wonder if they had to pay all the T & A women for their 'efforts' in making this film?",1,1,2,27 April 2001
The Insider," Holds it's own against All the President's Men. Silkwood or The China Syndrome.
","Sure, Russell Crowe did a good job in portraying Jeffery Wigand, but the real star for me was Christopher Plummer playing Mike Wallace. Not that he was Mike Wallace in the way that Jim Carrey was Andy Kaufman, but his attitude and presence was letter perfect. It reminded me of Jack Nicholson's cameo in Broadcast News - self important, pompous and so sure of himself.",9,0,0,17 April 2000
This Is Spinal Tap," A movie to watch again and again.
","It's not hard to be the best 'Rocumentary' ever made if the category only contains one entry.   In this case though, Rob Reiner's dead-on spoof is about as good as it can get. Thanks in no small measure to the excellent performances of the members of his invented 'world's loudest band.' The breath and depth of Reiner's delightful vision is endless.  Every time you watch  you'll discover something new. Catch the DVD with hours of additional dialogue, most of it made up by the actors as they went along.",10,0,1,9 March 2001
Gladiator," No big deal.
","This is a good movie for watching on TV if there are no Star Trek reruns on. Heck, I've even seen some infomercials that were more entertaining than this. It sure wasn't 'Best Picture' material.",4,0,1,1 May 2001
