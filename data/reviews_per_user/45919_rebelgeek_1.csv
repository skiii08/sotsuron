The Avengers," Perfect Director, Perfect Cast, a Big Geek Happy!
","I'm not what you would consider an authority on the Avengers, but I did grow up reading all the Marvel comics I could get my hands on. I eagerly watched every movie, TV show & cartoon starring super heroes. I was a big fan of the old Incredible Hulk TV show starring Bill Bixby & Lou Ferrigno. I read Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, & Avengers Comics as well.I would suggest before seeing the Avengers, Seeing Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America & Thor. It's not prerequisite, but it would certainly enhance your enjoyment of the movie.Joss Whedon is one of my favorite directors/writers/producers (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Firefly, Serenity, Dollhouse & Cabin in the Woods). I love his sense of humor.At first I was disappointed that Edward Norton didn't return for the role of Bruce Banner, but Mark Ruffalo was Incredible as the Hulk! Samuel L. Jackson brings the bad ass to the role of Col. Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D.! Robert Downey Jr. brings his charisma to Iron Man again. Chris Evans (Captain America), Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye) and Tom Hiddleston (Loki) all brought the magic in their roles!The story and action were amazing. Just the right balance of eye candy, character & comic relief. I plan to see it again in the theater & buy it on Blu-Ray. I've only seen a handful of movies in the Theater more than once, so that is high praise from me. I eagerly await the next Marvel movie!",10,1,3,5 May 2012
