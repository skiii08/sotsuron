Catch Me If You Can," Review
","I think Catch Me If You Can was absolutely wonderful! I recently watched it for the second time and it was as lovely as I remembered it being in theaters. I have renewed respect for Leonardo DiCaprio- I had underestimated his acting ability after seeing things like Man in the Iron Mask and Titanic. I thought he beautifully portrayed the charismatic but treacherous Abignale. (Abagnale?) Tom Hanks, who is always impressive is a wonderful Carl Hanratty- achieving a perfect balance of emotions, you love him but hate his job. Dialogue is clever, the plot is fast-paced and well-written, and the characters are captivating. I am now compelled to read the real Frank's novel. Being based on a true story gives the movie a strong foundation, but it can stand on its own as a brilliant film. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have!",Null,0,1,23 June 2003
