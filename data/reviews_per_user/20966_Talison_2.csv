The Blair Witch Project," The Worst I've Ever Seen
","I went into this movie with great expectations. Truly, it was a wonderful idea and an amazing concept. The web sight and Sci-Fi Channel special helped build up a hype around this movie that I thought it deserved. I was scared before going in. It's a shame that the actual movie captures none of the magic created by the hype. The movie is build up after build up without any sort of pay off. Not only was I never scared, but I was angry that nothing ever happened after an hour and a half of waiting.",1,0,2,1 August 1999
X-Men," Worth my 9 year wait.
","Yes, nine years. I was a freshman in high school when I first picked up a copy of Wolverine and was introduced to the world of X-Men. I immediately fell in love with the characters and was reading the trade magazines to find out when I would see a movie.Now the moment has come, and it was worth it.This was definitely one of the best comic book films that this comic book fan has ever seen. It had none of the problems that most comic films have. The dialogue wasn't cheesy, it was very realistic. The look of everything was also realistic without being untrue to the comics. I can't believe that they got Wolverine's hair right.The changes to the characters backgrounds weren't anything that made me mad or dramatically changed the characters. Nothing like the Joker killing Bruce Wayne's parents. They basically just put the characters together at a different time then when they all met in the comic. In the end, it made the characters they chose work well together without 10 hours of background story to cover 35 years of comic book development.All and all, I have to say that they presented a very dramatic movie story and fully used these amazing characters to their full potential.Let's hope Spiderman is this good.",8,0,0,17 July 2000
