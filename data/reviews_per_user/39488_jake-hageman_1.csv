10 Cloverfield Lane," A claustrophobic thriller that benefits from its small cast
","So when I first heard about this movie, I thought it looked stupid. Of course I didn't know much about this movie, but I still held rather low expectations for this movie. I thought initially 'okay she just has to figure why she's in the bunker that's not too exciting'. BOY WAS I WRONG. This movie exceeded my expectations by a long shot. It kept me intrigued with an exhilarating story line. It developed really good characters based off of strong performances from all the actors, especially John Goodman. I'd argue that this is one of his best movies of all time. This movie also feels very claustrophobic. This movie made me feel like I was there with them in the bunker, figuring out why I was there. And I loved it. I always admire movies that are able to draw me into a world and keep me there until the credits roll. The cinematography and writing for this movie are both phenomenal. The acting and directing is just incomprehensibly good. And the ending is very unexpected, but I found it very intriguing and fascinating. One more thought. What I think is the best part about this movie is its ability to blend genres. This movie takes aspects of horror, thriller, suspense, mystery, sci-fi, drama, and even a couple comedic moments and makes a stunning movie. It's impossible to confine it to one genre since it fits so well amongst multiple genres. I am very satisfied with what I was presented with with this movie. I highly recommend you check it out! If you have Amazon Prime, you can watch it free on Amazon Prime Video!",10,0,0,25 October 2017
