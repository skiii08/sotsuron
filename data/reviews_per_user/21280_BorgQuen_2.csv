Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Different from the originals, but still a wonderful movie.
","It's getting weary reviews, but it is a GREAT movie! It's like already classic. I have to admit that the humor appeals more to younger viewers than episodes 4, 5, and 6. But that's necessarily a bad thing. The special effects are EYE-POPPING and just plain amazing. The computer created characters are quite realistic. The costumes (especially Queen Amidala's), technology, and locations are just beautiful! How can you give this movie a bad review?! It may not measure up to the first three in SOME people's eyes, but in itself it is a terrific movie. My only complaint is that Liam Neeson played Qui-Gon Jinn without much emotion. However, that's just a tiny little irk.",Null,0,0,23 May 1999
Detroit Rock City," Really funny
","I don't really like KISS at all, but this is a really funny movie. A group of my friends saw it on opening night and my best friend was like, gotta be there an hour early or it'll be sold out. Yeah right, we were almost the only ones in the theater! The film is hysterical! We all liked it. Lex (Andrews) and Trip (DeBellos?) had the kewlest 'endings.' The only part that wasn't too good was the part with Hawk in the car with the older woman... he could have had a much better 'ending.' Otherwise it was all quite enjoyable.",8,0,1,17 August 1999
