First Man," Shake it all about
","This is certainly no Apollo 13Instead of special effects they just keep shaking the camera relentlessly.
There again they couldn't even film Janet Armstrong walking down her drive without shaking the camera a bit. Despite all the advances in CGI they could have probably made this on a small budget back in 1975.It is noticeable that what I believe to be stock NASA footage like the LEM taking off is way smoother and more watchable than other bits of 'Spaceflight'There are too many close ups and not enough story telling. If Neil Armstrong really was so brooding then maybe they should of featured more of other characters like Buzz Aldrin who in his few scenes actually comes across as an enthusiastic guy.",3,145,260,14 October 2018
