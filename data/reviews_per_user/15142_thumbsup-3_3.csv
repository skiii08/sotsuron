Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Thanks George for a film I can bring my 5 year old to see.
","I was a teenager when the first SW came out and was blown away! My daughter loves all three films too. I went to see it first without her to see what would be depicted. I was very pleased to see that after 20 years someone can still tell an interesting story without sophisticated, horrific, blood-spattering scenes. Jar jar was mildly annoying but had my daughter laughing out loud. I look forward to the next two prequels as equally fun and entertaining experiences. Much of Hollywood and even Disney could learn a great deal from this film maker.",8,5,7,21 June 1999
Legends of the Fall," dog-gone he's fine!
","I know, I know--most guys HATE this film. Believe me, we girls know WHY! I loved it, even though Pitt wore way too much clothing. It's not historically educational and it didn't bring the house down at the Oscars but it was well worth the purchase price. Brad, Aidan and Hopkins--it's all good! (ET boy really makes a strange looking adult, huh?) Pop this one in the VCR next time he goes hunting, fishing, blah blah blah and ENJOY!",9,1,2,31 May 1999
Hercules," Disappointing Disney movie FOR KIDS
","The music was great and. of course, the animation superb. I do not look to Disney to teach my child morals or any life lessons (Mom's on the job) but I do expect fun entertainment. This was my daughter's first movie to see on the big screen. It taught me to go see Disney films first by myself. I was very disappointed with the sophistication of the Hydra scene. Did we really need the green goo spewing everywhere? This had my child covering her eyes and wanting to go home. You can certainly believe that this did not transfer to my burning up the wallet on Hercules merchandise. Many adults LIKED the movie but the Disney machine needs to be mindful that pleasing the KIDS is where the money is. I'm off to see Tarzan.",2,7,21,21 June 1999
