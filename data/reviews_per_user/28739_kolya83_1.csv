Skyfall," Naomi Harris is the best MoneyPenny EVER!
","I've been a big James Bond fan all my life. And Miss MoneyPenny has always been resigned to a no frills just for laughs B-grade roll. Its most refreshing to see Miss Harris breathe new life into this role, and surprise us w/her newfound identity at the end of the movie. I would have to rate SkyFall as the best Bond movie ever, even though Sean Connery is a class act that has been hard to beat. I caught the late night pundits jaw-jacking the nite before about asking Daniel Craig if there ever would be a gay James bond. If anyone is reading this, i won't ruin the surprise of his answer, or why the question was being asked. Go see the movie, and if you can, go see it on IMAx.",10,18,39,10 November 2012
