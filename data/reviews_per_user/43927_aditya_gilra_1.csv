Blade Runner 2049," Poor science and poor story-line
","Blatant disregard for science, and poor story blew this one for me (I didn't like the scientific flaws in the original either, but this is really the pits). Film-making is very similar to the original Blade Runner, and can be considered good, but for me should always be secondary to the plot. Wouldn't classify as sci-fi in my opinion, and not fantastic enough to be fantasy either.",5,5,10,22 October 2017
