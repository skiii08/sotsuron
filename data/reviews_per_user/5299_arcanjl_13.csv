First Man," Not the first man... to love this movie
","I should start off stating that I saw this moving during a flight ;) and further more, it was one of the most turbulent flights I have ever been on. Did that add to experience? Very well could have been, I mean, I did have to turn off the movie for a little bit, cause I was freaking a little. That ALL being said, it was awesome! I thought the acting was fantastic! I don't know if that is how Armstrong always acted, but that is the way I pictured it. That kind of personality is what is needed to make that kind of journey, not to mention his wife. So good! If you are at all interested in Armstrong, or what it took to get to the moon this is a must! If not, its a 'should' :)",8,1,4,4 March 2019
Darkest Hour," Gleaming Hour
","This was so good. I practically watched it twice back to back. Gary Oldman was amazing, but that usually goes without saying. The story was incredible. It was such a trying time, and I was so disappointed that we didn't help out sooner. I understood both sides, and felt the pull. Churchill basically rolled the dice and hoped for the best. If anyone else was there, this would be a very different world. Man in the High Castle anyone?",9,1,2,3 March 2019
Us," Pure garbage
","After watching twilight zone, I should have given this a hard pass. But nope, wanted to give it a shot. The acting was meh, the scary voices were so bad, I cringed, and the whole point is confusing and nauseating. WTH? Trying to make a point on society, or just came up with a garbage idea and turned it into a movie.",1,2,5,8 August 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Eight for you, Three depressing Billboards for me
","Ok, I agree that Frances should get best actress and Sam should get best supporting. It was incredible. The story was deep and intense. But it was way too dark for me. I like light movies these days, sad and depressing is not for me, so that is the only reason I gave it a 3",8,0,3,3 March 2019
Split," One of my favs
","I am a a huge fan of M. Night Shyamalan. Well, more acurately my feelings towards him is digital. I either give his moves 0 stars or 10. Nothing in between. This is a 10-er. This is the 3rd time I have watched it. I watched it in preperation of Glass. His story telling is slow and maticulous, with acting that is out of the park. I LOVE this movie.",10,2,5,27 February 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," And more powers for it
","I enjoyed this movie. It's probably good for the older kid as well. There are some aspects I did not like, for example why did he have to have extra powers... And I didn't care for Porky pig too much. But I really liked Nicolas Cage in a Noir. Was fun to watch, specially in an airplane killing time :-)",6,1,2,25 March 2019
Goon," You got me to watch hockey, and... like it!
","If you don't mid a little blood, this movie is awesome. Feel good, and some good fighting, and a splash of romantics. Too bad we don't see Seann anymore, he did great in this movie. On to the sequel...",8,0,0,27 February 2019
2012," as catastrophes go...
","It always drives me crazy how lucky the main person has to be, but as my son says, why write about anyone else? lol I liked the movie, as over the top as it was it was fun to watch. I might have skipped through the emotional crap that they couldn't pull off and went right to the action, but hey, that's what remotes are for :) Also, one passing thought, if that would happen... we'd be dead.",6,1,2,22 July 2019
Jurassic World," ... of hurt
","I would consider myself a fan of the Jurassic series, but wow, this was boring, even with the non-stop action. I could SEE it trying to involve me, the viewer, but the story was such crap I couldn't do it. The special effects were good, but the story was not. Pass on this one.",3,1,2,3 May 2019
Hotel Mumbai," ... a place I want to visit
","Hmm, this one was hard. I would have to say that I hated the movie but could not rate it poorly because it was well done. It was the subject matter. horror, and the blatant pacifism made my blood boil. By the time I finished watching I was so mad. The lack of preparation was just disgusting, and power of brainwashing, just makes me mad, makes me mad to write this damn review. Can you tell?",8,2,13,20 June 2019
War Machine," Well oiled and smooth Machine
","I thought this movie was great. Brad Pit was awesome, and I enjoyed the subject too. It made me mad of how much we expect out of these people, and tie their hands to do it. The subject of if we should be there or not, is not relevant. If we send them, we need to support them.",8,0,0,3 March 2019
12 Strong," This wasn't Thor?
","I was hoping for better. I thought the score was a little over the top, and I have a problem with Chris Hemsworth... he just too type cast for me, sorry.",5,0,1,27 February 2019
Green Book," Wow!
","I normally feel that academy award winners are bloated, and sometimes even crappy. But this move was fantastic. This genre of movie is not one I usually enjoy, and honestly was not looking forward to watching it... that is why it took so long. But I loved it, it was thought provoking, and showed all the prejudice without going over the top, shock, or disgust. It was tasteful, entertaining, and heart felt. just a fantastic movie. The acting was out of this world, it was weird seeing Viggo Mortensen so heavy, but wow. :)",9,0,2,21 June 2019
