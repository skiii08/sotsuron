Sucker Punch," Not about sex or girls or pimps or fantasy
","At its core, this is a film about freedom.Through the words of Professor La Paz in The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, Robert A. Heinlein once said:'I am free, no matter what rules surround me. If I find them tolerable, I tolerate them; if I find them too obnoxious, I break them. I am free because I know that I alone am morally responsible for everything I do.'This film illustrates that concept.",8,2,3,17 November 2019
The Irishman," Had the opportunity to be great...
","Biggest problem with this film is the length, could have easily been trimmed by 30 to 45 minutes. Just because you're turning a book into a film doesn't mean you have to try and keep all the aspects of the book, even when they are unnecessary to the working of the film.",6,4,12,28 November 2019
Spotlight," Absolutely stunning film
","This is a movie that everyone should see, Catholic or not. It illustrates so well the corruption that is endemic to large, powerful bureaucracies. The acting is superb, the story well paced, the reality dealt with perfectly.An extraordinary film.",9,0,0,23 December 2019
Quantum of Solace," Superb Bond movie
","In some ways, this movie is better than Casino Royale.If you like Bond because of the movies. If you really enjoy the Roger Moore Bond, than you probably won't like this Bond.If you like Bond because of the books, I think you will enjoy this Bond very much.This is a spy movie, not just a thriller. There are clues and misdirection. If you don't pay attention, you won't get the subtleties. If you do, the subtleties can make the movie very interesting. Very interesting indeed.Every character is essential and has a role, information that you can gather from them. And the game isn't over when the movie ends (if you think it through, you'll know that it can't be).The bad guys aren't threatening. They are worse. If you really pay attention and figure out their goals, they are a lot worse.This is a movie that will be worth seeing more than once... and as people see it again, how they value it will grow. It's not for mindless entertainment (although there is plenty of that too). To get the most out of it, you have to think and not be deterred by the misdirection.",9,5,10,7 November 2008
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Starts off slow and weird, ends really, really strong.
",This movie starts off terribly - even for the characters it is setting up.... but it builds and builds and builds. Sit through it. It's worth it.,6,0,1,18 July 2018
