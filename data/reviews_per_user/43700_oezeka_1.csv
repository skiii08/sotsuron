The Avengers," Is avengers the best movie ever
","The movie Avengers is a good movie because of the the marvelous effects and the plot. They picked the excellent actors to play the characters. The actors Robert Downey Jr.( Iron Man), Chris Evens (Captain America), Jeremy Renner (Hawk Eye), Mark Ruffalo (Hulk), Tom Hiddleston (Loki) and many more good actors. The other reason Avengers is a fine movie to watching is the action, adventure, and the bravery. In addition 'The Avengers' is a a satisfying movie because the heroes are trying to protect the world from the Thor's brother Loki. The movie has frequent scenes with fighting. In most of the movie Loki's army is trying to invade the world. While Thor and the rest of the avengers are trying to assure the world safety. As the world is being attack and protected at the same time. The Earths Mightiest Heroes are fighting and as music is playing it makes feel like you are in an awe while your watching the movie. After about five seconds it goes back into all the action that is accruing around the world. Furthermore, the movie 'Avengers' has a lot of adventure. In the movie the heroes do not like each other very much but have to learned to get along especially Iron Man and Thor. 'The Avengers' have to learned how to fight with each other and to grantee the world safety. It is an adventure because while they are on the verge to fight Loki and his army. They make Hulk mad and he turns into the green monster and he conveniently almost kills BlackWidow. Although there is a abundant of fighting, I thought there should have been scenes with close friends and family. It would have been better if some of the heroes might have said bye to their families. I thought they should have to said they might not make it back to some one they love. The movie would be a fantastic movie if they had just a little less action. Evidently In this movie there is a lot of bravery. There is bravery when Iron man says 'We have a Hulk' telling Loki to back Down in different words. As they are fighting when they get knocked down they just get back up. There is even more bravery when Loki throws Iron Man out the Window and iron man is brave and waits for his suit to come and save him. Even though Loki is evil he stills stands up to Hulk then Hulks repeatedly beats Loki.Finally as the movie ends the avengers meet at street and they all just stand there; Nick Furry tells them they did a good job and if there is another invasion they will avenge it. Other wise I give 'Avengers an eight because of things they could have done to make the the story better. So they would have got people caught up in the sympathy.",8,1,4,8 November 2012
