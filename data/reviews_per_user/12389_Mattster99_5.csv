Gremlins," So funny!
","This Movie is fantastic!Joe Dante's 'Gremlins' is a fun and enjoyable film, but it is scary at times, but I still love it. It really is the best little monster attack type film, and you even root for the Gremlins themselves, because of their enjoyable pranks, stupidity and by far their laughs, it just sticks in your head.This movie even spawned a sequel 'Gremlins 2: The New Batch', which is also filmed by Joe Dante, it is great as well, but it isn't as good as it's predecessor. If you haven't seen this film then, go rent it, buy it, you just have to see 'Gremlins'.",8,1,3,12 November 2009
Batman Returns," An absolute thrill-fest from beginning to end!
","Tim Burton went for a much more darker, creepier and serious approach to the 'Batman' series and what we got was an absolute blockbuster!. He did a superb job with 'Batman', and now he has done an even better job with this amazing sequel.In the prologue a wealthy couple have a deformed baby, and because they can't handle it they throw the baby in to the lake nearby, some years later... Crimes have been occurring around Gotham City, involving a group of Circus Freaks, than the city calls Batman (Michael Keaton) to stop the ongoing and escalating crimes. A local businessmen named Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) forms an alliance with the leader of the Circus Freaks, a man named Oswald Cobblepot (Danny Devito), who is a deformed man just trying to fit in to the real world, and Max tries to help him by making them colleagues, but when Max's assistant Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) discovers he's a evil businessmen she tries to leave the building but Max catches her, and shoves her out of the nearby window, she later becomes Catwomen, and wants revenge on Max for what he did, Batman is framed for things and is now believed to be just another evil villain, and than Batman tries to take down the the evil team...All the actors do a perfect job in their roles, Michael Keaton is always great and will always be my favorite 'Batman' of the whole series and Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman was a perfect choice by Tim Burton, Danny Devito plays his part well, he really pulled it off,it is really over-acting at it's finest, Christopher Walken was great as the slimy evil businessmen Max Shreck, which his name is a reference to the first 'Dracula' movie, 'Nosferatu', because the actor that played the vampire was named 'Max Shreck'.The atmosphere of the film was perfect, dark, gloomy, perfect for a 'Batman' film, the script must have been written really well, because the film always keeps you interested and it never drags or becomes corny it just stays as Tim Burton Wanted it.This film it for any good action lover, it's not to be taken very seriously, hardcore 'Batman' fans will not be disappointed, so if you haven't seen it, go rent it, buy it, it's an absolute blockbuster.",8,1,2,3 April 2010
Van Helsing," A good action flick!
","Stephen Sommers did pretty well when he made 'The Mummy', but when I saw this, I was so happy that the film had been made, because I had been looking forward to it for a long time, just another huge monster mash, like 'The Monster Squad' or the 'Abott and Costello' films. This film brought together the classic Monster Movies, like 'Dracula', 'Frakenstein' and much more.I'm guessing some people hated this film, and thats OK, because it is their opinion and they can stick with it, I on the other hand think it had a good plot, pretty good acting, but a very good amount of suspense.Some of the Dialouge was a bit dumb, like the scene where Dracula is babbling about his life, and winging to his wives, he says (or yells) 'No, I have no Heart!', which was really laughable.Hugh Jackman does well as the part of Van Helsing, he was a good choice for the role, Kate Beckinsale was good as Anna Valerious, one of the descendants of her Grandfather to kill Dracula, David Wenham was funny as Van Helsing's Gadget and Weapon provider Carl.The Plot was quite good and easy to follow, and it was nowhere near predictable, except the ending where Van Helsing kills Count Dracula, the usual good guy kills bad guy routine.I recommend it to all who are a fan of Action\Horror\Adventure films, or movies where they bring back classic film characters, so if you haven't seen it, go rent it, buy it, it's a fun film.",7,0,1,17 December 2009

Speed," One of the Greatest Action movies ever made!
","'Speed' is really just an awesome adrenaline-pumping action flick, Keanu Reeves is great as the hero, Dennis Hopper is great and crazy as the villain, and Sandra Bullock is really good as the leading lady. Jan De Bont did a great job when he Directed this, and I always enjoy this movie from beginning to end.In the opening L.A two police officers, Jack Travis (Keanu Reeves) and Harold Temple (Jeff Daniels), are trying to save a group of people from a broken Elevator shaft, that is about to fall, the cause for the problems are caused because outside the shaft the cable wires have been rigged with bombs, and will explode, they save the people and find the man who set the bomb, they than find the bomber (Dennis Hopper) and Harold gets shot in the arm while the Bomber holds him hostage, the Bomber runs and the part of the building they are in explodes, from the Bomber's dynamite. Later.... Both cop's win medals for saving the hostages, and than go to celebrate. The next day Jack is getting a coffee at a local caf√© when a bus explodes, and a nearby payphone rings, he picks it up, and the Bomber from the building tells Jack that he has a bomb rigged on a bus, the sensor for the bomb will turn on when the bus goes above 50 MPH, and after that can not explode until the bus slows down to 50 MPH, will Jack make it in time to help the Innocent people on the bus...This film is an absolute thrill-ride from beginning to end, and I never get tired of watching it, the actors all do such a great job, Jeff Daniels is hysterical, Sandra Bullock really was a good choice for her character, Joe Morton really does great as the Captain of the police squad, and Dennis Hopper is one of my all-time favorite villains, the dialogue was well written for this movie, and has a really good line (in my opinion) at the end, but it is kind of corny.'Speed' is a very enjoyable film, i recommend it to any action movie lover, or just an awesome Friday night flick,what are you doing reading my review, go rent it, buy it, it's a blockbuster.",9,0,0,9 April 2010
