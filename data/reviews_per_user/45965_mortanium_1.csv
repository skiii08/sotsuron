Skyfall," awful 'interpretation' of bond
","i registered just to put my thoughts down on this crapmovie ! to call this a 'bond' movie is blasphemy, none of the bondingredients we have grown to love are there, instead bond is now an aging soon to be retired hasbeen.bond as a womanizer is gone...all the bond gadgets are gone, the clever plot...gone, the bondgirls, GONE ! the epic genius bondvillain, GONE we have a villain who steals the performance of the movie, brilliant acting, way overshining that of daniel craig, just awesome, BUT, unfortunately the villain is a retard; he plans for years some genius moves, all carefully thought out in the last detail, only to (spoiler) end up in a courtroom for a shootdown with some security, and fails...he has access to explosives, but chooses a good ol shootdown, which he himself attends to of course...and fails...no, if u like bond, and want to keep it that way, Don't go watch this one, worst 'bond' movie yet",1,7,16,28 January 2013
