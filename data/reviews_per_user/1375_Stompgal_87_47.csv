Despicable Me 2," As enjoyable as the first but with more laughs and a superb soundtrack
","Having already enjoyed the original, I really wanted to see the sequel, which I'm renting out as I type. It has a slightly different plot from the original but it has more funny moments than the original as well.The animation is just as good as that in the original with the same quirky character designs (one reviewer has previously said that Lucy looked too much like Audrey from 'The Lorax' but to me she looked quite different from her) and futuristic visuals plus some completely different backgrounds such as the shopping mall like no other and the minions' island inside a giant flask. The incidental music is similar to that in the original and Pharrell Williams's 'Fun, Fun, Fun (the song that accompanied the original's thrilling roller-coaster scene)' was used again in Agnes's birthday party scene near the beginning. Despite these musical similarities, I like Pharrell's other song 'Happy (which I heard before seeing this film due to it being a massive chart hit)' as well as Mungo Jerry's 'In The Sumnertime,' David Guetta, Flo Rida and Nicki Minaj's 'Where Them Girl's At,' Bob Marley's 'Jammin' and Pitbull's 'Don't Stop the Party' plus also the minions' hilarious renditions of 'I Swear' and 'YMCA' during the wedding scene at the end. There are also certain elements from the first that are present such as the freeze gun and the fart guns (there are more of them in this film) but I liked the fact that there were differences such as the minions becoming mutated into vicious purple creatures. All the characters from the first film are just as entertaining here while Lucy is sweet and a great companion to Gru.Overall this is another worthy sequel to an original film with its soundtrack, animation and funny moments being its best elements. 8/10.",8,0,0,29 March 2014
Kung Fu Panda," Not the best Dreamworks CGI but at least it has a top-notch voice cast and stunning action scenes
","I received this on DVD for Christmas in 2008 because I wanted to see it at the cinema but didn't get around to seeing it. When I finally watched it on DVD, I felt somewhat disappointed and underwhelmed because it didn't meet all of my expectations. The weak points of this film include Po's father being a goose (it makes no sense, despite the fact that he's a supportive character), the darker scenes being less detailed than those in daylight, some scenes being forgettable and the ending being somewhat silly and abrupt, in spite of the emotion of Shifu apparently dying but in fact he finds peace. The film is also clichéd in places such as including a number of uses of slow-motion, one of the Furious Five telling Po he'd be late for work in his dream at the beginning and his father saying the same when Po awakens and Tai Lung falling through the ground leaving a hole in his shape upon Po defeating him. Also the majority of the Furious Five only have names that are the same as their species, although Tigress is the most inventive name of them all.On a more positive note, this film has a well-known voice cast; epic martial arts action scenes; twists and turns in the dumpling scene between Po and Shifu; an engaging back-story of Tai Lung (he looked very cute there); a breathtaking fight between the Furious Five and Tai Lung on the rope bridge (the bridge itself was reminiscent of Shrek), and some funny moments, especially Po imitating Shifu when he and the Furious Five eat noodles. I also like the 2D animation in Po's dream (despite the cliché I mentioned earlier) and the end credits as well as the beautiful illustrations for the majority of the end credits (making them unique from having them scroll up a black background) and the post-credits scene where Shifu offers Po a dumpling and Po accepts. The scene where Oogway is lifted up to the sky by blossom petals is beautiful if a tad sentimental. I could relate to Po in a sense because he eats when he's upset (I.e. comfort eating) and I've eaten for comfort in the past.Overall, this film wasn't as good as the Shrek franchise, but it was worth watching for the artistry, action scenes and voice cast. 7/10.",7,0,0,8 June 2013
Beauty and the Beast," A stunning childhood Disney Classic that I should have seen more often
","I saw this film once or twice as a child upon owning the VHS and started watching again when I was 18 upon borrowing it from a volunteer/social worker but sadly fell asleep halfway through due to having had the tendency to tiring very easily. Today, which is Boxing Day 2013 as I type, my mum suggested we watch a Disney film and I insisted we watch this one due to its inclusion of a couple of memorable musical numbers ('Be Our Guest' and the titular song) that had equally memorable animation sequences and were also on my 'Sing Along Songs: Be Our Guest' VHS I had when I was five and retrieved from eBay a year or two ago. I also insisted on watching this because I mistakenly thought this was my mum's favourite Disney film but it is in fact 'The Little Mermaid (and one of mine)' although she found this one very good as did I.The 2D animation is fluid and smooth with beautiful interior and exterior backgrounds but there were one or two that looked a tad CGI-ish for the film, especially the ballroom during 'Beauty and the Beast' but it looked magnificent nonetheless. In addition to the musical numbers I've already mentioned, I also liked the opening song ('Belle/Little Town?'), 'Gaston,' and 'Something There' although I found 'The Mob Song' and 'Human Again' pretty forgettable as well as some of the incidental music, which was also pleasant if dramatic in parts. The script has its fair share of humorous and poignant moments, the former including the antics of Gaston's bumbling sidekick Lefou, Cogsworth's line, 'It it ain't baroque, don't fix it (my mum was in stitches with that one)' and some of the townspeople's goings on during the opening musical number; and the latter including the falling rose petals and the Beast apparently dying. While Belle remains headstrong yet sensitive throughout, I liked the Beast's change of character after their argument while Belle tries to treat his wound/scratches from the wolves. Lumiere and Cogsworth are comical side characters while Chip is very sweet and Gaston became what some may perceive as a good man gone evil. I also liked the stained glass windows that accompanied the back-story of the Beast at the beginning as well as the final one depicting him as a handsome human being with Belle.Overall this is a stunning Disney Classic that I regret not seeing as much as 'Peter Pan,' 'The Little Mermaid' (both of which are as good as this one) and 'Cinderella (which is nearly as good but still a favourite of mine)' due to the majority of musical numbers being memorable and the animation being Oscar-worthy. 9/10.",9,2,2,26 December 2013
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," A different kind of rom-com although somewhat disappointing
","I wanted to see this film when it came out at the cinema with a member of support staff who worked at the house I moved to shortly before it was released but due to staff shortage, I didn't get to see it until today when I rented the DVD. The reason I wanted to see this film in the first place is because there aren't many romantic comedies that focus on couples getting a divorce, so its theme of Emily wanting a divorce from Cal was one of the film's strongest points. While this has more strengths than weaknesses, I was somewhat disappointed with the film's length being a little too long for my liking, the dialogue being clichéd in parts, particularly within the first half, and the uneven pacing.Further to the film's concept, the acting was well done and mostly subtle. While the script had its clichéd moments and pop culture references to Twilight and Dirty Dancing, it had sound funny parts, especially about a female character's PG-13 life (possibly a fourth-wall joke relating to the film's certification in the USA); the film had some creative cinematography, particularly the shots of Cal's head covering Jacob's privates while they're in a locker room and the close-up shots of Jessica applying her make-up before taking nude selfies; and there was also a decent soundtrack with funky, contemporary and emotive snippets of incidental music and some pleasant if forgettable songs. The best songs for me were Goldfrapp's 'Ooh La La,' 'I've Had the Time of My Life' from Dirty Dancing, Spandau Ballet's 'True (also featured in the 2000 film remake of 'Charlie's Angels') and Middle East's 'Blood' that played into the closing credits. As for the story, I liked how the subplots of certain characters were revealed such as Bernie turning out to be Jessica's father and Hannah being revealed to be Cal and Emily's eldest daughter. The cast includes some well-known stars such as Steve Carell (Cal), Julianne Moore (Emily), Ryan Gosling (Jacob), Zathura's Jonah Bobo (Robbie) and the face of the EE mobile network Kevin Bacon as Emily's work colleague David.All in all this film has some enjoyable, engaging and memorable moments but it also had some aspects that left me slightly dissatisfied. 7/10.",7,0,1,19 June 2014
Madagascar," A fun, adventurous film for children and adults alike
","I first saw this film when I was 18 and I enjoyed it back then. When watching it with my mother recently (she owns all three films in a box set) we both had a laugh and there were a few parts of it I didn't notice first time around, such as the 'Planet of the Apes' reference and recognisable pieces of music (most notably 'Chariots of Fire' that was used in London 2012 Olympics coverage and the 'Hawaii Five-0' theme that plays when Marty surfs towards the beach).This film has witty characters, delightful sight gags (especially when Marty spots a woman wearing a black and white striped top) and luscious backgrounds, particularly the island of Madagascar itself. I also liked the scene where the four main animals were shown inside their boxes whilst being shipped to Madagascar - it was cleverly executed and had a similar style to split screen mode. The 'Who's the cat?' Chase scene between Alex and Marty is hilarious and uses the principle of follow through and overlapping action perfectly. The voice cast is well known as well. While this film is mostly aimed at children, there are parts of it that may go over their heads such as the psychedelic hallucination sequence when Alex is tranquillised and the 'American Beauty' reference. Mort, the baby lemur, is very cute too.Overall, this was a highly enjoyable film. It was no 'Shrek,' but it still had its funny moments. 8/10.",8,1,1,7 July 2013
Ted," A decent comedy that quickly goes from cute to irreverent
","I remember this film being promoted two years ago and in the television advertisement for this, I liked the line, 'My bad! I was sending a Tweet,' which for me is one of the funniest and most memorable lines in this film. One of my housemates rented out this film in the same year it was released but I only watched about the first fifteen minutes of it at that time. More recently I rented it myself and when I watched it the whole way through, I was slightly more satisfied despite the film dragging on from the middle and it was also a little overlong.For a start, Ted was well-animated and comically voiced by Seth MacFarlane who brought us 'Family Guy.' Speaking of which, the irreverent dialogue in this would appeal to fans of the said animated sitcom and Ted's mention of Peter Griffin was a cracking fourth-wall joke and pop culture reference rolled into one. Other pop culture references I noticed were to other films distributed by Universal such as E.T. and Jurassic Park and I figured that they could pay homage to Universal's centenary in 2012. Back to 'Ted,' the titular character's animation was one of the best assets of the production values as were the cinematography and some beautiful uses of scenery, particularly John's snowy childhood neighbourhood (plus also the lens flare effect over it) and the park. While the incidental music was pretty grand for the film's genre, the music accompanying Ted falling down after having been torn in half was simple yet suitably chilling and dramatic. I also liked the song played over the opening credits as well as the use of the Flash Gordon theme, Norah Jones's ' Come Away with Me' that she briefly performed live and Tiffany's 'I Think We're Alone Now.' Both Joneses (Sam from Flash Gordon and Norah) were surprising additions to the cast and what surprised me even more was Norah's dialogue since I never saw her to speak in a tongue-in-cheek way but Sam's appearance was more worthy, especially when he demonstrated his Flash Gordon actions. With regard to the leading human characters, the chemistry between Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis may have been typical rom-com cliché but their bonding with Ted has made this chemistry somewhat new. The narration from Patrick Stewart was engaging and almost as irreverent as the film itself.Overall 'Ted' is a worthwhile comedy that has its cheeky moments but funny ones too, albeit its sluggish pacing and long running time. 7.5/10.",7,1,3,10 May 2014
Spice World," One of my favourites, whether of all-time or from my childhood with great music and laughs
","Between the ages of 9 and 11, the Spice Girls were my favourite pop group, which was a legitimate enough reason to see this film. It was the first film I ever saw at the then-new Virgin Cinema (now a Cineworld) in Spytty Park, Newport, South Wales and I have loved it ever since. Within the following year when the video was released, I was in my now-defunct local Woolworth's with my mother and sister and when my mother asked if I wanted her to buy this movie on video, it was an offer I couldn't refuse. I have watched it several times when I was younger but not in recent years because the video is in my bed drawer with the bed drawer side to the wall (like my 'Charlie's Angels' movie DVD) so I decided to rent the DVD after not having seen the film for as long as I could remember. It's as excellent today as it's always been and upon watching this today, I spotted a few things that I hadn't noticed in previous viewings such as Mel B styling Bob Geldof's hair at a party, Jonathan Ross interviewing the girls early in the film and Barry Humphries playing the hot-headed newspaper editor Kevin McMaxford.While this film has lines that are silly and make no sense (such as Clifford's hair-in-plug holes announcement) and a cheap-looking scene of the Spice Bus jumping over the Tower Bridge as the girls rush to their concert, the dialogue is memorable and funny in parts, the cinematography is suitably varied, the editing is straightforward yet effective, the pacing is swift and the acting is just right with the Spice Girls truly allowing their personalities to shine, particularly Emma and Victoria (who smiles a bit more here than people may think). Despite some of the songs having different instrumentations than one would normally hear, the music is a essential asset to this romp and it was a good idea for the Spice Girls to use their second album Spiceworld as the main soundtrack and there were even some delights from their debut album Spice. The incidental music may be rarely used but it included a groovy piece when we first see the girls' pregnant friend Nicola and creepy, tense music when the bald photographer steps out of the toilet for example. Although the Spice Girls are the main stars here, there was fantastic support from Meat Loaf (who references one of his songs before the girls encounter some aliens) as Dennis the Spice Bus driver, Richard E Grant as Clifford, Naoko Mori as Nicola and Claire Rushbrook as Deborah plus more celebrity cameos from the likes of Elton John as himself, Michael Barrymore as Mr Step and Stephen Fry as the judge.Overall, this is an excellent musical comedy that didn't deserve the Razzie it received. 10/10.",10,3,4,20 May 2014
Finding Nemo," A vibrant underwater adventure with a simple yet engaging story
","As a fan of films and TV shows set underwater, this one appealed to me without doubt. I saw this film at the cinema 10 years ago while I was going through a difficult stage and I enjoyed it then but initially found the jellyfish scene frightening (even though I was 16 at the time). Nowadays I find the film more enjoyable than I did on my first viewing.The underwater scenery is vibrantly coloured as are the majority of sea creature characters that are also realistically designed. A lot of the dialogue is memorable and it has parts that cleverly link to other scenes, have hints of wit and an element of Chinese whispers when the message of Marlin looking for Nemo is passed through several sea creatures and reaches Nigel. I also liked how the story alternated between Marlin's search and Nemo's antics in the fish tank in the dentist. One thing I noticed for the first time today is that Bruce and his shark friends are in a group that is almost like Alcoholics Anonymous and similar groups. The story is straightforward yet captivating with some funny moments such as bubbles rising to the surface upon the explosion of the underwater mines, thus making a pelican thinking another had farted, Dory speaking whale, the seagulls' constant cries of 'Mine! Mine! Mine!' and Marlin's interrupted attempts at telling others the mollusc and sea cucumber joke until he finally succeeds towards the end. I also spotted a couple of pop culture references such as the scene where Bruce chases Marlin and Dory and says, 'Here's Brucie!' that pays homage to 'The Little Mermaid' and 'The Shining' while one fish shown during the message about Nemo being passed on looked like Flounder. The background music was better in the first half than the second half but I liked the use of the screeching violin music from 'Psycho' when Darla enters the dentist and the end- credits song 'Beyond the Sea' by Robbie Williams. As for the voice acting, Albert Brooks played a typical father figure as Marlin, Ellen DeGeneres was comical as Dory while Alexander Gould was cute as Nemo, I liked the late Joe Ranft's French accent for Jacques and John Ratzenberger was recognisable as the School of Fish that direct Marlin and Dory to Sydney (I also liked the shapes they made to form fish, an arrow, the EAC and the Sydney Opera House).Out of all the CGI underwater films I've seen ('Shark Tale,' 'The Reef,' 'A Turtle's Tale: Sammy's Adventure' and this one), 'Finding Nemo' is my favourite and a sheer delight to watch. 9/10.",9,0,1,2 October 2013
Rise of the Guardians," The best Dreamworks film since the Shrek franchise, albeit its confusing title
","When I first heard of this film, I got it confused with 'Legend of the Guardians,' a live-action fantasy film about owls. Due to my passion for animation, this appealed to me more when I saw this trailer, which had the most impressive character designs since those from the 'Shrek' franchise, particularly those of the guardians themselves.The animation quality is on par with that from the 'Shrek' franchise with intricate character designs, pretty special effects and atmospheric backgrounds if some were a little too dark. The musical score is powerful, epic, poignant and magical while the closing credits song is absolutely beautiful. As for the story and dialogue, they both have a fine mix of excitement, sadness and humour while the story is adventurous and uses representations of Jack Frost, Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny in an entirely new and unique way. The funniest characters for me are the elves (they reminded me of the minions in the 'Despicable Me' franchise if they were not quite as humorous), the Easter Bunny and the furry creatures with moustaches. With regard to the main characters, Jack Frost is ambitious, Tooth is bubbly, Sandy is an effective communicator by expressing himself through facial expressions, body language and various sand symbols floating above his head and surprisingly comes back to life towards the end of the film, North is supportive, the Easter Bunny (I love his accent) is cynical yet comical and Pitch, while reminiscent of Voldemort from the Harry Potter series and Maltazard from 'Arthur and the Invisibles,' is threatening yet suave. The child characters are sweet and full of fun, especially Jamie Bennett and his little sister Sophie. Moving on to the voice acting, Chris Pine, Alec Baldwin (despite his Russian accent making his voice as unrecognisable as Steve Carrel's voice for Gru in the 'Despicable Me' films), Isla Fisher and Hugh Jackman all provided a brilliant variety of voices to their characters while Jude Law provided Pitch with a chilling combination of intimidation and menace.To conclude, 'Rise of the Guardians' is a stunning fantastical adventure that is better than 'Shrek the Third' and 'Shrek Forever After' and nearly as good as the first two 'Shrek' films. 9/10.",9,4,6,27 April 2014
Tangled," A beautiful, moving, dark and funny take on Rapunzel
","I first saw this at the cinema two years ago with a temporary support worker at my former care home and we both enjoyed it. Likewise with 'Horton Hears A Who' and 'Igor,' this is another film I found more entertaining than I did on my first viewing.Although the entire film could easily be mistaken for a Pixar film due to its CGI animation, it is beautifully rendered with characters whose styles tend to differ from those of typical Pixar characters, stunning colours and realistic backgrounds. The floating lanterns scene is exceptionally gorgeous as is the glowing effect on Rapunzel's hair. The animation itself is just as good as that of recent Pixar films such as 'Toy Story 3' for example. I also liked the majestic if poignant and tense incidental music with a touch of Celtic authenticity and the songs, especially 'When Will My Life Begin?,' 'Mother Knows Best' and its reprise where Mother Gothel sings about Rapunzel knowing best as a clever twist, 'I've Got A Dream' and 'I See The Light.' While Rapunzel was cute as a baby and a slightly older child, the teenage/young adult version of her is as aspiring as Tiana from 'The Princess and the Frog' and as excitable as Tiana's friend Lottie (the scene of her up-and-down feelings upon leaving the tower is one of the most memorable), Flynn Ryder/Eugene is amusing (especially the joke about his nose being drawn incorrectly on his wanted poster) and suave while Pascal is cute and provides some laughs with his colour changes but the funniest character here has got to be Maximus the horse with his dog-like traits. Mother Gothel is a wicked so-called maternal figure who is reminiscent of the queen in 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,' Malificent from 'Sleeping Beauty' and Lady Tremaine/Cinderella's stepmother - I liked the shocking twist of Rapunzel discovering that she is not her real mother. The writing has a fine mix of humour, emotion and darkness with a hint of intelligence and Mandy Moore was a more than worthy choice to voice Rapunzel since she can both sing and act (I remember her as a singer from my early teenage years) if the other voice actors are not quite as well-known. Another positive aspect is the Steamboat Willie logo to commemorate 'Tangled' as Disney's 50th animated classic. It's not just a Disney Classic, it's a modern Disney Classic. While I have previously mentioned that 'The Princess and The Frog' bridged the gap between 'Bolt' and this one, this bridges the gap between 'The Princess and the Frog' and the 2011 version of 'Winnie the Pooh,' Disney's most recent 2D animated feature length film to date. Not only that but this is one of Disney's best films to come out in recent years and the short follow-up film 'Tangled Ever After' is a must-see as well. 9/10.",9,1,4,16 November 2013
"Monsters, Inc."," A fun and thrilling treat from Pixar
","I saw this film at the cinema with my mum and my sister when I was 14 and we all enjoyed it back then, Surely it's not quite as good as the Toy Story franchise but it is better than its prequel Monsters University and the short film Mike's New Car.Firstly I liked the straightforward concept of monsters scaring children and collecting their screams to power the city. Secondly, the animation is up to Pixar's usual standards, even for 2001, with quirky and colourful character designs for the monsters, fluid movement and imaginative backgrounds. Thirdly the script was engaging with some funny, mildly scary and moving moments; the film's pace is even and the story had some fun, thrilling moments such as the door vault scene (reminds me of the luggage vault scene in Toy Story 2) and Sulley and Mike coming across the Abominable Snowman when they get banished for sneaking Boo to work, although some scenes are not as memorable as the ones that entertained me the most. While the soundtrack sounded somewhat generic, it had some fantastical elements and I liked the opening jazz music as well as the end credits song 'If I Didn't Have You.' Further to the end credits, I liked the company play footage. Sulley and Mike are diligent partners, Boo is sweet and playful, Mr Waternoose is firm, Randall is a scheming villain and Roz is strict but is funny during the outtakes (which are also a great laugh). The voice acting was superb, especially from John Goodman as Sulley, Billy Crystal as Mike, Mary Gibbs as Boo, Bob Peterson as Roz and John Ratzenberger as The Abominable Snowman. Overall, Monsters, Inc. is an amusing and thrilling offering from Pixar that is a sheer delight to watch despite the somewhat genetic soundtrack and a few forgettable moments. 9/10.",9,0,1,14 June 2014
Grease," One of my favourite musicals that was a highlight of my youth
","The first time I saw this film in its entirety (prior to this I saw the musical number clips on VH1) was at the cinema when it was re-released for its 20th anniversary when I was 11 and in my first year at secondary school. Re-visiting this film today brought back many memories, especially my Eisteddfod performance of 'Summer Nights (one of the best songs)' with my form. Before I saw the film in full, I'd listen to the film's soundtrack on tape on 'Wet Play' days (playtime in the classroom on rainy days) with my fellow classmates at primary school.There are plenty of positive aspects of this film such as the majority of musical numbers being memorable (with the exception of There Are Worse Things I Could Do,' Rizzo's second solo performance that I completely forgot about), especially 'Grease Is The Word,' 'Summer Nights,' 'Look At Me I'm Sandra Dee,' 'Hopelessly Devoted To You,' 'Greased Lightning (and the dance to go with it), 'Beauty School Dropout,' 'Sandy (my housemate does a brilliant rendition of this one),' You're The One That I Want (which I also remember from a Shape yoghurt advert from my childhood) and 'We Go Together (which sounds a little like all versions of 'The Tide Is High') as well as a version of 'La Bamba' being played in the background in the first Frosty Palace scene; the costumes and vehicles that were true to the 1950s setting; the impressive choreography (especially the school dance scene) and the odd funny moment, especially the scene where Jan imitates the beaver in the toothpaste commercial at the slumber party at Frenchy's house - I couldn't help myself laughing at that today! I also liked the animated segments consisting of the title sequence, toothpaste commercial and the promotional refreshment animations at the drive-in. After having watched the Nostalgia Chick's review of this film, she helped me notice things I hadn't on previous viewings such as Rizzo feeling like a defective typewriter and her pregnancy rumours, although one thing I noticed for the first time today was product placement (a Reese's Peanut Butter Cups billboard ad in the opening sequence and Jan eating a Twinkie at Frenchy's slumber party). The songs made the film go quickly and they were broken up by the various antics of the T-Birds and the Pink Ladies whether they were hanging out at Frosty Palace or partaking in a car chase. I also remember the up-and-down relationship between the two protagonists very fondly.Overall this is a thoroughly enjoyable musical that has sheer nostalgic value and I'd undoubtedly like to see it time and time again. 10/10.",10,3,5,11 September 2013
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," Just as fun as the first but with more adventure and as many laughs
","I first saw this in the cinema in 2008 and I initially thought it was better than the first but after having watched it for the first time in five years, I actually found it on par with the first.The opening of the film involving the back story of a young Alex (then known as Alakay) was rather unusual for a sequel but I soon found that it linked to Alex re-uniting with his parents after crash-landing in Africa. The penguins were even funnier here than in the first but I wish Mort had more screen time because he's so adorable. Like the majority of sequels I've seen, there are references to the first film such as news reports concerning the disappearance of Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman and the elderly woman beating up Alex as well as the baddie lion towards the end. The red mark she left on his bottom after slapping it was a bit scary because it reminded me of my fear of parents smacking their children in public, an issue I am totally against. In terms of other positive moments, the backgrounds were just as beautifully rendered as in the first and I couldn't help laughing when Alex repeatedly called out the name of his little blanket-thingie and an adult animal covering her cub's ears because it sounded like a slightly rude word (possibly a slang term for female anatomy). I also liked some of the background music, especially the whistly tune that accompanies the shark chasing Mort and the 'Good, the Bad and the Ugly' type music when the elderly woman beats up Alex. The baby versions of the four main animals were as cute as Mort and I also liked the song that played while baby Alex/Alakay was swept away to New York. This film reminded me of 'The Lion King' in parts, especially the opening back story and the main animals seeing several more of their kind. I liked the cut-out- animation segments that played during the first part of the closing credits as well as the CGI animation during the main feature.Overall I found this sequel an engaging watch and I found it more adventurous than the first. 8/10.",8,2,3,31 August 2013
Ratatouille," Not Pixar's best but has its funny moments, great voice acting and is preferable to 'Lifted'
","I've only seen this film a few times so far and while it's not Pixar's best ('Toy Story 3' is) due to being a little overlong and having some slow and forgettable moments, it is preferable to the short film shown before it in the cinema (I didn't see this in the cinema by the way, I rented the DVD once) and has some amusing parts, especially Remy's father telling him to shut up and eat his garbage and another rat spitting grapes at Linguini later in the film.The CGI animation is as good as always for Pixar with some great 2D segments thrown in (the book illustration of Gusteau coming to life and part of the closing sequence) and Paris is realistically rendered. A lot of the characters are intriguingly modelled, the voice acting is exquisite (Skinner and Colette sound the most authentic) if the actors are somewhat lesser-known and the music has some variety to it - the French song by a female singer that plays twice is hard to understand yet lovely. The plot is clever with a lot of 'close shave' parts (especially Skinner thinking he had seen Remy but Linguini denying this) and I like how some of its elements link to the title and the title itself could be a pun on rats. Remy is especially cute and is a talented chef who eventually goes out of his way to assist Linguini. While Linguini is insane at times, he is also ambitious although Colette is sometimes threatening but eventually has a change of heart towards Linguini. Certain parts of the film made me sympathise with Remy, especially when he gets separated from his family, and I liked the earlier scene where Remy is shown flying out of a broken window with a recipe book, which leads to him telling us how it happened. I can see why the moment the food critic has a flashback of eating ratatouille as a child was the inspiration for the Richmond Sausages advert where a man has a flashback of eating them when he was younger but it was an effective scene nonetheless. I also liked the closing shot of the 'La Ratatouille' restaurant sign superimposed over a lovely view of Paris with the Eiffel Tower intact.Overall this isn't my favourite Pixar film but it has a valuable message saying 'anyone can be a chef' and moments that made me giggle. 8/10.",8,0,0,30 November 2013
Enchanted," Truly enchanting with a fine mix of 2D animation, live-action and CGI plus several references to other Disney films
","I've rented this film a few times and have thoroughly enjoyed it. While it's a little overlong for my tastes, it was swiftly paced and had plenty of scenes to enchant me. It was also the first time I'd ever heard of Amy Adams, who was sweet and full of determination as Giselle.The opening animated sequence, which makes up the first 10 minutes of the film, is fluid and brightly-coloured with a style that is reminiscent of Disney Rennaisance films such as 'Beauty and the Beast' and 'The Little Mermaid' and I enjoyed watching the characters from Andalasia in live action form trying to get used to New York. The dialogue is mostly original for a fairytale-themed film with some clever perceptions of certain objects such as Giselle thinking a billboard advertisement is a castle and Prince Edward believing the TV in his hotel room is a mirror. I was amused by spotting the many Disney film references, particularly 'Snow White,' 'Cinderella' and 'Sleeping Beauty' as well as the name of the Italian restaurant being a nod to 'Bella Notte' from 'Lady and the Tramp.' As for the musical score, it is very fitting for the film's theme and beautiful, especially when Pip the chipmunk tries to act out Nathaniel trying to poison Giselle with an apple and the orchestral versions of 'True Love's Kiss', whimsical and has the odd use of haunting choral vocals, particularly during Queen Narissa's live action parts. My favourite songs from the film are 'True Love's Kiss,' 'Happy Working Song (reminiscent of 'Whistle While You Work'),' 'That's How You Know (the catchiest of them all and reminds me of 'Under The Sea')' and Carrie Underwood's 'Ever Ever After' that plays towards the end. The cinematography is creative and I especially like the camera work when Giselle's arm drops to the the floor, the poisoned apple rolls down the stairs and onto the ballroom floor - a very dramatic shot indeed. Further to the apple, I liked the brief running gag of Nathaniel offering Giselle a caramel apple and an apple martini in disguise. The cast did a great job with playing their parts and I liked how they used their actual voices for the voice acting in the animated segments. I also liked the pop-up book segments and it reminded me of a technique used in the 'Longman Video Classic Nursery Rhymes' video I watched a lot as a child.Like 'The Princess and the Frog,' this film uses the Disney fairytale formula with modern twists perfectly and is the best film combining animation and live action since 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' 9/10.",9,1,1,11 December 2013
Inside Out," Not my favourite Pixar film but colourful and thought-provoking nonetheless
","When I first saw this film at the cinema, I found it a little underwhelming due to having already seen certain clips of it on YouTube although the scene where Joy is in the memory dump brought tears to my eyes. The second time I saw it upon purchasing the DVD I enjoyed it even more.The animation is bright, colourful and up to Pixar's usual standards and it is interesting to see how it changes when Joy, Sadness and Bing Bong take a so-called shortcut while the inside of Riley's head is realistically designed. The characters that represent Riley's emotions give more depth to her feelings and this concept is reminiscent of a Beano comic strip called The Numskulls. Joy is playful and optimistic for the most part although it is heartbreaking to see her cry in the memory dump; Sadness is suitably glum and the revelation of her true purpose is a pleasant surprise; Fear, Disgust and Anger all personify the rest of Riley's emotions perfectly and Bing Bong mostly has a similar personality to Joy but he is also fairly naive as well as supportive to her and Sadness. Riley is a headstrong, determined human lead character that all pre-teenagers can relate to and I like how her feelings conflict with her adapting to San Francisco as well as her relationship with her parents. The story is unique for a Pixar film and like the Toy Story franchise it has its fair share of uplifting and poignant moments and the scenes shown during the closing credits of other characters' emotions are hilarious. While most of the music is not particularly memorable there are some effective pieces such as when a very young Riley expresses her anger in response to her dad saying she won't get any dessert if she doesn't eat her broccoli and when Joy shows the rest of the emotion characters how Riley's memories are made and I like the Bing Bong song. While I'm not familiar with the majority of the voice cast they all did a great job with the voice acting particularly Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Lewis Black as Anger and Mindy Kahling (also Taffyta Muttonfudge in Wreck-It Ralph) as Disgust. Bill Hader as fear wasn't quite as up to scratch as the rest of the emotions but he was decent nonetheless. Also this is the first time Poehler and Hader have provided voices in an animated film together since Hoodwinked Too, which I haven't seen in its entirety yet.Overall not on par with other Pixar films such as the Toy Story franchise, A Bug's Life, Brave, Up and WALL-E but it is on par with Ratatouille and The Incredibles and better than Cars what with its colourful animation, thought-provoking story and relateable characters as its best aspects. 8/10.",8,4,26,16 January 2016
Wreck-It Ralph," The best computer game-themed animated film since 'Scooby Doo and the Cyber Chase', although not Disney's finest
","I have wanted to see this film for ages since I like computer games although I do not play them now as much as I did when I was younger. 'Wreck-It Ralph' has a great mixture of characters, fantastic backgrounds, a varied blend of animation styles and a diverse range of music but I found the story confusing in places.While the most prominent animation style is 3D computer-generated, I like the old 2D computer game-style animation whether it was used for the stylised Walt Disney Animation Studios 'Steamboat Willie' logo (the best incarnation since the one used before 'Tangled' to commemorate it as Disney's 50th animated classic feature-length film) accompanied with a vintage video game-style arrangement of Mickey's whistling or used for the Fix-It Felix Jr. arcade game segments. The 3D replica of the world of Fix-It Felix Jr. had some jerky animation on the characters but I guess it was done intentionally to reflect the jerky animation in the original game. Nevertheless the majority of the 3D animation was superb and matched the same standard one would expect in a Pixar film. The backgrounds were imaginative, in particular the inner workings of the arcade machines, their power supply and the sweet pastel-coloured world of Sugar Rush (what a great name for a candy-themed racing game). The latter environment had some clever and witty elements such as Nesquick sand, laughing Laffy Taffy that hung above it, the Diet Coke swamp and the Mentos falling into it, thus putting a new spin on the now-slightly outdated soda-and-Mentos-fountain trend.The best characters in this film are Wreck-It Ralph (albeit having blocky arms and legs yet a more rounded head and body), Fix-It Felix, Calhoun (one of the most realistically-designed characters in the film), Q-Bert (who I remember from an updated version of the game for Sony PlayStation) and Vanellope (sounds like a cross between Vanessa and Penelope) Von Schweetz, who reminded me appearance and personality-wise of Agnes from 'Despicable Me'. John C. Reilly was impeccable as Ralph, Jane Lynch really brought her Sue Sylvester (the harsh cheerleading coach in 'Glee') side to Calhoun; and Q-Bert was amusing with his gobbledygook style of speech with his speech bubbles similar to those used to suggest profanities (which there is little to none of in this film); however I was uncertain about Sarah Silverman's voice for Vanellope to begin with since she made her sound like a cross between a cutesy little girl and a teenager but Vanellope became more likable as the film progressed.The story is mostly original but there are parts of it that were derivative, such as the main character being a villain (a la 'Despicable Me' and 'Megamind') albeit its references to video games that were fun to spot (including Dr Eggman and Sonic the Hedgehog, Q-Bert, Pac-Man and King Koopa/Bowser from the Super Mario games), and complicated, especially in the middle but I liked its dramatic twists such as Ralph destroying Vanellope's new car but Felix fixing it and that during the car race as well as the idea of Ralph and other computer game villains attending an Alcoholics Anonymous-type group and the arcade characters coming to life at closing time in a similar manner to the toys coming to life in the absence of humans in the 'Toy Story' franchise.Although a lot of today's music is not as diverse as it used to be, I found this film's soundtrack very diverse indeed. It consists of electronic old computer game-style music (I liked this style applied to 'Oh, Susanna!'), more-familiar chart hits (Kool and the Gang's 'Celebration' and Rihanna's 'Shut Up and Drive' that played along their corresponding scenes very well) and some lesser-known numbers such as 'Sugar Rush (reminded me of those quirky Japanese pop songs you'd hear in a Cybercandy store)' and Owl City's 'When Will I See You Again?' that played during the end credits. I did, however, find parts of the soundtrack generic since they sounded similar to other musical scores for films of a similar genre and I wasn't too keen on the piece of instrumental modern dance music played during an earlier arcade scene because I usually only like dance music if it has added vocals.Overall 'Wreck-It Ralph' did not meet all of my expectations but it ran at a reasonable length, paid homage to video games in a unique way and above all was the best computer game-themed animated film since 'Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase.' 8/10.",8,0,1,10 January 2014
The Little Mermaid," My first Disney film that still holds up well today
","I fondly remember watching this film as a child alongside other Disney Classics such as 'Peter Pan' and 'Cinderella' and it is still one of my favourites to this day. I will also give it some credit for the first Disney film I remember seeing. I have recently purchased the Diamond Edition of this film on DVD in a triple pack with its sequel and prequel.The animation is not quite as flat or sketchy as it was in earlier Disney Classics such as 'The Jungle Book,' 'The Aristocats,' and 'The Rescuers' since there must have been a slight improvement to it since 'Oliver and Company' (another favourite of mine) and I generally like animated films and TV shows set underwater (this one, the spin-off TV series, 'SpongeBob SquarePants' and 'Finding Nemo' especially) because I find them rather therapeutic. While some of its elements may differ from those in the original Hans Christian Andersen story (for example Ursula's rules regarding Ariel's transformation as a human differing from those in the original story), it has a happy ending that isn't rushed like the one in 'Cinderella.' Other parts of the film that hold up well are the majority of songs, especially 'Part of Your World,' 'Under the Sea,' 'Poor Unfortunate Souls' and 'Kiss the Girl' but the other songs are not quite as memorable. Nevertheless I liked the use of the Can-Can music while Chef Louis chases Sebastian through the kitchen. Despite the song 'Daughters of Triton' being brief and rather forgettable, I can still remember the shock of Ariel's six older sisters discovering that she is not in her giant clam shell as part of the concert and instead collecting human odds and ends. One iconic scene in this film is the one where Ariel leans on a rock with the waves splashing behind her while she sings another portion of 'POYW' after having rescued Eric from the shipwreck. It reminds me very much of the Little Mermaid statue in Denmark.Ursula is one of the most menacing villains I've ever come across while her eel assistants Flotsam and Jetsam are creepy.One slight difference I noticed between the Diamond Edition and the version I remember as a child is that during the first wedding between Eric and 'Vanessa,' the vicar's knobbly knees were removed because they were mistaken for something else that I'd rather not mention...Overall this Disney Classic holds up today as well as 'Peter Pan' did. 9/10.",9,2,3,4 September 2013
Frozen," Not quite as good as 'Tangled' but beautiful visuals and excellent music nonetheless
","I have wanted to see this film since I saw the teaser trailer featuring Olaf, a goofy yet cute and funny snowman and Sven, a dog-like and equally hilarious reindeer. Both my mother and I laughed at the trailer really hard when we saw it at the cinema before 'Monsters, University.' The official trailer was also good and I liked the line, 'That's no blizzard, that's my sister!' that wasn't included in the final cut of the film much to my disappointment because it is funny, clever and as sassy as Anna is. I watched this film on Amazon Prime Instant Video last night and it met some of my expectations, particularly the story, the visuals and the music but I felt certain elements were similar to those from 'Tangled,' particularly Anna and Elsa being modelled in a similar manner to Rapunzel, the horses looking like Maximus, Sven behaving like him, Anna's gingery-brown hair changing colour when Elsa strikes her like Rapunzel's did when her long, golden hair was cut off and the kingdom here looking a little similar to that in 'Tangled.'Other than the similarities to 'Tangled,' this film has many positive aspects such as the animation being as good as that in 'Tangled,' 'Wreck-It Ralph' and recent Pixar films, the stunning visuals with beautiful, cool and rich colours, Anna, Elsa and Kristoff all looking cute as children, the attractive special effects and the excellent soundtrack. My favourite songs are 'For The First Time In Forever,' 'Love Is An Open Door, and 'Let It Go (I didn't like this song too much to begin with because it sounded a bit too shrill for my liking but when I heard it on Heat Radio when they were playing movie songs all day to celebrate the Oscars, it has grown on me since).' While one reviewer wasn't hugely keen on 'Fixer Upper,' the song performed by the trolls, I personally found it the funniest song in the film while 'Do You Want To Build A Snowman?' primarily sung by young Anna is sweet. I also liked the acapella opening music and while the score wasn't quite as memorable, it had its moments of beauty and tension although it became more memorable since I purchased the soundtrack on CD. The film was quite fast-paced and the story and dialogue were dramatic with the odd heartwarming and funny moment and I was happy that the ending used bits of animation from the teaser trailer on Olaf. The voice acting was exceptional, particularly from Kristen Bell as Anna and Idina Menzel (Nancy Tremaine in 'Enchanted') as Elsa. Overall, this film didn't quite impress me as much as 'Tangled' did due to its similarities but it was worth watching thanks to its story, music and visuals. 8.5/10 to round up to IMDb's 9/10 rating.",9,7,11,21 April 2014
The Incredibles," Incredible by name, incredible by nature although not Pixar's best
","I saw this film at the cinema twice when I was 17; once with my mum where we missed the beginning and only saw it from the part where Dash is in the principal's office with Helen/Elastigirl for putting a pin on the teacher's chair; and the second time when I saw it with some fellow college students and support staff as a reward for keeping on top of my work. It is on par with 'Cars' and 'Ratatouille' but it is not quite as enjoyable as the likes of 'Up' and the 'Toy Story' trilogy (my personal favourite Pixar films, especially TS3).The positive points of this film are the action scenes, cool special effects and the futuristic monorail-type pods and Syndrome's long-legged robotic contraptions that looked awesome. I also liked the fact that it avoided certain superhero clichés such as Edna Mode not adding capes to the Parr/Incredible family's suits due to them causing problems with past supeheroes in spite of Elastigirl being similar to Mr Fantastic and Violet being similar to The Invisible Woman/Girl but Syndrome's demise was creative since his cape got caught in a jet engine, thus adding a new spin on a superhero cliché and a villain death. Another part that kept me entertained was the running gag of the little boy on his tricycle waiting for Mr Incredible/Bob to do something amazing, which eventually led to him shouting, 'That was totally wicked!' upon witnessing an explosion. The fact that there were two sides to the Parr/Incredible family was appealing because they were a typical dysfunctional family in some scenes and a cooperative superhero family in others. One part of the film that confused me was Dash's place in his race towards the end of the film because on the first few times I watched this film I thought he came first but when I listened to the audio description (which I enjoyed listening to because I was doing a radio drama course at the time), he had actually come second. I found the film a tad overlong as well, but I thought Frozone was a rather amusing side character and Jack-Jack is a cute member of the family. Although he didn't do much to begin with, I liked him bursting into flames and becoming metallic when trying to defeat Syndrome.Overall this isn't Pixar's best but it is still watchable for its breathtaking action scenes, futuristic elements and its use of superhero clichés in new ways. 8/10.",8,0,0,9 August 2013
The Elephant Man," A dark, scary and poignant biographical drama
","I vaguely remember seeing parts of this film as a child and how dark it seemed. This evening I saw it in full and it had a mixture of moments that scared me and made me smile and an ending that nearly made me cry. Either a scene of John Merrick lying on the floor at the freak show (or something along those lines) or the ending of him lying on his bed made my sister sob her heart out when she was nine because she was worried he would die.Due to its black and white cinematography as well as its old movie style, I initially thought this film was made way before 1980 but that's not the thing that bothered me the most. The film felt slow in places and had some forgettable moments but the beginning (a screaming person rolling back and forth being superimposed over a stampede of elephants, which mistakenly made me think an elephant disfigured Merrick's face by trampling on it) and ending scenes (Merrick dying and a vision of his mother against a starry sky) are two of the most memorable parts of the film as well as the train station scene where Merrick tells a mob that he is a human being and not an animal. Other standout assets were Merrick's distinctive style of speech, a tear falling down Frederick Treves's face, Merrick becoming attracted to a woman who is afraid of him, a female character reciting dialogue from 'Romeo and Juliet (the 'good pilgrim...' part), the play scene, some earlier visions of what looked like a fair complete with a Punch and Judy puppet show and the camera sweeps of Merrick's cathedral model while the London Symphony Orchestra's beautiful rendition of 'Adagio For Strings' plays. John Hurt's make-up accurately resembled the real Elephant Man's disfigurement and all music was old-fashioned with some eerie pieces but the music at the play and 'Adagio For Strings' were more pleasant to the ears.Overall this was a gripping biographical drama with disturbing yet memorable scenes and a couple of well-known cast members (Hurt and Anthony Hopkins). 8/10.",8,0,3,28 December 2013
Ghostbusters," 'Don't cross the streams.'
","I once saw the part of this film where the Ghostbusters hit the headlines while Ray Parker Jr's theme song is played but what made me want to watch this film in full the most was the 'Don't cross the streams' part of the dialogue being used as the sound clip for the 11 Second Club's March 2014 competition, so I decided to rent the DVD. On my first full viewing, I was so tired that I fell asleep for part of it, thus making it harder for me to follow the story, so I paused it and came back to it later. I initially gave this film a 6/10 but after having found the film easier to follow second time around due to being more awake, I upgraded my rating to a 7 because most of the film is engaging with a few minor flaws.First off, I found the acting from Rick Moranis overdone for his character Louis Tully. Secondly, the pacing was uneven with the part between the headline-hitting sequence and the climax with the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man being the slowest despite some effective scenes such as Louis and Dana becoming possessed (the view of Central Park as they embrace is beautiful as is the accompanying orchestral piece) and several ghosts taking over New York. Thirdly, the animation on the horned demons was jerky and a bit slow.Moving onto the positives, the theme song, despite being played three times throughout the film, is catchy and memorable while Elmer Bernstein's musical score is at its best when it is chilling and powerful. The animation on the ghosts, especially Slimer, was better than that on the horned demons and the Marshmallow Man was generally well done and the scanimation used for the proton streams to capture the ghosts was adequate. Moranis's overacting aside, the acting from the rest of the cast was subtly done, especially from Bill Murray and the late Harold Ramis. Annie Potts (who later went on to voice Bo Peep in the first two 'Toy Story' films) as the Ghostbusters receptionist Janine and Sigourney Weaver as Dana were surprising additions to the cast. A lot of the dialogue is memorable, especially the 'Don't cross the streams' part and while the Ghostbusters base is run-down, the hotel dining room when the Ghostbusters catch Slimer is elaborate and the scenery of Central Park is stunning. I also liked the ghostly drone-sounding siren on the Ghostbusters' car, the haunting beginning at the library and the well-paced ending where Slimer surprisingly flies towards the screen.Overall, 'Ghostbusters' is a mostly entertaining horror film with its music, dialogue and the majority of special effects being its best features.",7,1,2,24 May 2014
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Intriguing and original idea but somewhat overlong
","This is one film I wanted to see at the cinema when it came out but didn't get around to although my former friend's niece saw it and probably enjoyed it. I eventually added it to my LoveFilm rental list and got sent it for free last year in the run-up to Christmas because LoveFilm were generous to send me a free rental during that time.Moving on to the film itself, I found the story unusual and engaging for the most part but it was somewhat overlong and it had an element from one of my least favourite film genres (war movies) but I liked the film tying in with major events such as Armistice Day and Hurricane Katrina, both of which coincided with Benjamin's birth and Daisy's death respectively. It was interesting to have the story span across several decades and I liked the fact that the titular character was born on 11th November 1918 (the day World War I ended) since it is also my Nan's birthday, although she was born in 1937. I found parts of the story a tad hard to follow so I ended up reading the synopsis on Wikipedia to help me. The historic costumes were true to their eras up to Benjamin's 'old-on-the-insude-youthful- on-the-outside' stage sometime in the 1990s, which I found surprising, and I liked the cast since Brad Pitt is one of my favourite actors - the only other films of his I've seen are 'Ocean's Eleven (which was forgettable and harder to follow than this one despite its well- known cast)' and 'Happy Feet Two (a decent follow-up to the first).' It also made sense that Benjamin and Daisy were portrayed by different actors to show their varying ages throughout the film such as Pitt and Cate Blanchett playing them in middle age and Elle Fanning (Dakota Fanning's younger sister, both of whom voiced the sisters in 'My Neighbour Totoro') playing Daisy aged about seven, but the actors playing the 'old-on-the- inside-youthful-on-the-outside' Benjamin are lesser known. There are some heart-wrenching moments such as Queenie the nursing home worker having died during Benjamin and Daisy's reunion sailing trip, her funeral and Benjamin dying on screen towards the end, which was implied by his eyes closing in a similar fashion to Marley closing his eyes whilst being put down towards the end of 'Marley and Me.' I nearly bawled my eyes out when Benjamin died because it reminded me of the rarity of babies dying.All in all this film had an intriguing and more original idea than the likes of 'Big' and both versions of 'Freaky Friday' (the 1976 and 2003 versions) albeit its length, but I suppose it had to be over two and a half hours long to depict the various time periods. 8/10.",8,0,1,13 September 2013
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," One of the most inventive and unique animated films I've ever seen
","I first saw this film at the cinema with a member of support staff at my former care home five years ago and we both enjoyed it a lot. Recently my mother purchased the DVD for me when she got it for a special price with another purchase at HMV and when I watched it this evening, I enjoyed it just as much as I did the first time around.The animation is consistent for the most part with some good uses of squash and stretch, especially in the Jell-O scene, but it was sometimes rapid and jarring, particularly on Earl towards the end of the film and while the character designs are cartoonish with a few blocky elements (particularly the nose of Flint's father and Earl's hands) and not as realistic as those in the Shrek franchise, the visuals were inventive, the backgrounds were full of vibrancy, especially the enormous Jell-O 'palace' and when the film's setting was covered in ice cream, and detailed. It was funny when a banana 'boomerang' knocked the Columbia lady out of her spot in the opening logo and this is the most creative use of the logo since 'Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle' (in which the camera zooms into the fire of the lady's torch and links to a real fire in the film itself). I also like the use of hybridity. While the majority of the film is 3D computer-animated, I liked the use of the cute dog film to provide a background for a weather summary, the animated photograph of a cat and the 2D special effects plus also the brightly-coloured 2D end-credits sequence if it was jerky in parts. The story is unique and, as other reviewers have said, full of originality due to using the food theme in a way that has never been thought of in animated film before while the dialogue is witty and smart. Some of the funniest moments included Baby Brent's repeated 'Uh-oh!' line and Flint's monkey Steve (the second animated primate I've heard of with that name, the other one being from childhood favourite 'Spot the Dog') wanting gummy bears and eventually fighting them off during the climax. I did agree with a previous reviewer about Earl's line, 'I love you, son,' being repetitive but it was really sweet nonetheless. Despite the majority of the voice cast being lesser known, the voice acting is one of the best assets of the film and the cast members I seem the most familiar with are Anna Farris as Sam and 'The A Team's' Mr T as Earl. While the music is not the most memorable feature, I liked the song 'Sunshine, Lollipops and Rainbows' by Lesley Gore as well as Miranda Cosgrove's (who went on to voice Margo in the 'Despicable Me' films) 'Raining Sunshine,' the one playing over the 2D-animated portion of the end credits and the incidental music playing while an allergy-swollen Sam tries to pull up Flint with a Twizzler is beautiful. Both Flint and Sam are worthwhile leads while Earl and his son, the mayor, Baby Brent, Flint's father and Steve all provide great support.In spite of the animation being slightly inconsistent in places and a couple of repetitive lines, this film really is a feast for the eyes and is without doubt one of the most creative I've ever seen. 8/10.",8,1,3,22 April 2014
Dumb and Dumber," While not a fan of most road movies, this is a hilariously memorable film if crude and sad at times
","I remember watching this film as a child before I was 12 (which I shouldn't have done because its BBFC rating is 12). I'm not really a fan of road movies (with the exception of 'Rain Man,' 'Little Miss Sunshine,' 'RV' and this one) but I still found it side-splittingly funny.This film has a ton of memorable laugh-out-loud, crude and sad moments such as Harry and Lloyd driving in a dog van, Lloyd peeing in several bottles in the van followed by the 'Pull over' joke ('That's a cardigan!'), an owl being knocked out/killed by a flying cork, a dead bird being given to a blind boy, Harry getting his tongue stuck on an icy lamppost, Harry and Lloyd's makeover-type sequence set to Roy Orbison's 'Pretty Woman (this film was the first time I heard that song)' and Harry suffering from the nasty consequences of laxatives. Upon re-visiting this six years ago, I noticed some innuendo such as when Harry tells Mary she has a nice pair of hooters to which she questions, 'I beg your pardon?' (Because she thought he meant boobs) when Harry means the owls and word play when Lloyd mistakes an Austrian woman for an Australian one as well as the 'pull over' pun I mentioned earlier. The other thing I noticed first time around six years ago was the poor grammar in the opening credits but I soon understood that this was done to reflect the stupidity theme throughout the film. Jim Carrey was the funniest actor here while Jeff Daniels was nearly as humorous. I also remember watching the animated spin-off of this film, which was nearly as good.Overall this is one of the funniest films I have ever seen in spite of its crude and sad moments. 9/10.",9,0,1,10 August 2013
Brave," Pixar's first fairy tale is a winner!
","I love Pixar films, especially the Toy Story franchise. Like WALL-E, this is another Pixar film I never got to see at the cinema but saw for the first time upon renting the DVD. I didn't watch this the whole way through first time around due to a faulty disc but when I reported it, LoveFilm sent me a replacement that played with no trouble throughout. The second viewing made this film thoroughly enjoyable.The concept of this film being set in Scotland is unique for Pixar. The Scottish accents from Emma Thompson and Julie Walters are spot-on and Kelly MacDonald (who I remember vaguely as Evangeline in Nanny McPhee) was perfect as the headstrong Merida - likewise with Billy Connoly as Fergus. I loved the authentic musical score by Patrick Doyle while the songs by Julie Fowlis and Birdy with Mumford and Sons were lovely. The backgrounds were gorgeously and realistically rendered while some of the character designs were reminiscent of those used in The Incredibles (especially Merida and Elinor) but in a good way. Merida is beautiful with distinctive curly red hair and her triplet brothers are cute and comical. The animation is up to Pixar's usual standards - I especially liked Merida's effective archery scene that I remember seeing in an advert for this film.The story stands out from all the others that Pixar used and it had some clever and amusing parts such as Elinor talking to Fergus when he was pretending to be Merida while Merida was cleaning Angus's stable (that scene's intelligent editing made it look as if Elinor and Merida were actually talking to each other), a male character mooning (albeit his bottom not being Shown on screen) whilst saying, ' Feast your eyes!' and the hologram of the witch floating above the cauldron acting as an automated telephone message. There are also some emotionally intense and dark moments in the story such as Merida and Elinor not seeing eye-to-eye with each other and Elinor turning into a bear. My only complaint is that the story was complicated in parts but it still had some standout moments.Overall, this is a highly entertaining and authentically-produced Pixar film that was more enjoyable the whole way through. 9/10.",9,2,5,25 January 2014
Shrek 2," My favourite in the 'Shrek' franchise
","I remember seeing this in the cinema 10 years ago after having already enjoyed the first. When I finished watching this, I found it even better than the first one. At university today while myself and my fellow classmates were getting on with our own work, one of them put on this film as some background noise and we all laughed at it so hard.The animation here is just as good as that in the original while the backgrounds and human character designs are realistic. I also liked the usual designs on Shrek (as well as his transformation into a human), Fiona (who temporarily turns into human form) and Donkey while Puss in Boots was an amusing new supporting character that also looked realistic. The dialogue has a similar formula to that in the original and some similar lines but it is still engaging and hilarious. I liked how the script paid homage not only to various fairy tales some films ('Lord of the Rings' and 'The Wizard of Oz)' and a couple of nursery rhymes ('Jack and Jill' and 'Do You Know the Muffin Man') but also modern culture such as one of the musicians playing the 'Hawaii Five-O' theme on the trumpet (that really cracked me up today), Far, Far Away being based on Hollywood and 'Knights' being a spoof of 'Cops.' This film uses a similar technique to 'The Flintstones' (that combined the 1960s with the Stone Age) by combining the Middle Ages with the early 21st century. Moving onto the voice acting, Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy did as solid a job as voicing their characters in the first while Antonio Banderas as Puss, Julie Andrews as the Queen, John Cleese as the King, Rupert Everett as Prince Charming and Jennifer Saunders as the Fairy Godmother were equally entertaining. The soundtrack is also very good. It consists of a fantastical musical score plus original pop songs such as 'Accidentally In Love' by Counting Crows, 'Funkytown' by Lipps Inc, the Fairy Godmother's song she performs when she is first introduced plus also her rendition of Bonnie Tyler's 'Holding Out For A Hero' and Puss and Donkey's rendition of Ricky Martin's 'Livin' La Vida Loca.'Overall this is a funny and charming second instalment in the 'Shrek' franchise with a cracking soundtrack and great new characters. 10/10.",10,1,2,31 March 2014
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A stunning remake that is more faithful to Roald Dahl's book than the original
","As a child 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' was my favourite Roald Dahl book and 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' was one of my favourite films. When I saw this at the cinema with my mother when I was 18, I was impressed with how this was more faithful to the book than the original, albeit containing flashbacks of Wonka's childhood alongside additional scenes that were not mentioned in the book and leaving out the Lickable Wallpaper for Nurseries that was featured in the original film. Since my cinema viewing, I watched this film several times when I received it on DVD for Christmas and I watched this at my pen friend's house when I visited her for the day and she laughed at it more than I did.The scenery is an improvement over that in the original, which was vibrantly coloured but had a chocolate river that was more like muddy water and oddly-shaped Everlasting Gobstoppers, by being as colourful but having a more realistic chocolate river and round gobstoppers. I liked the Oompa Loompas' musical numbers here as much as those from the original because they had exactly the same lyrics as those in the book; however the song about Mike Teavee (who deviated from the book and original film by playing video games instead of watching TV) is forgettable despite the channel changes including him in every programme, the 1960s boyband spoof and the 'Psycho' parody being my favourites. I also liked the stock footage from '2001: A Space Odyssey' and its music. Further to the songs, the musical score by Danny Elfman (a regular collaborator with Tim Burton) is haunting yet whimsical particularly the opening music that accompanies the opening sequence of the interior of a chocolate factory. Technically this is darker than the original, especially the flashbacks of Wonka's childhood, but the boat ride here is not as scary as that in the original. Moving on to the characters, Charlie and Augustus here had exactly the same personalities as the original and this version's Violet is tougher but Veruca is not as spoilt as she was in the original and instead of watching TV, Mike plays video games. Willy Wonka and the Oompa Loompas were preferable in the original film but I liked the inclusion of Charlie's father here and his job at the toothpaste factory. I also liked the squirrel scene with Veruca being sent down the garbage chute because I love squirrels and this is one part that is more faithful to the book than the original. A lot of the dialogue is similar to that in the book if a little corny and random at times, particularly Grandma Georgina saying she likes grapes and Wonka later telling her she smells of old people and soap, which is stereotypical in a sense. The other part I liked that was close to the book was the story of Prince Pondicherry's chocolate palace.Overall this is a charming if dark remake of a childhood favourite with a satisfying number of scenes that match the narrative of the book. 8/10.",8,3,6,9 October 2013
A Bug's Life," More memorable than 'Antz' but not quite as good as 'Toy Story'
","I first saw this film when my aunt purchased it whilst visiting her. The first part I remember laughing at very hard was P.T. Flea telling his troupe of circus bugs they were fired after a fire at the circus. I've re-visited this film a few more times since my first viewing and whilst watching it on Amazon Prime Instant Video this morning, I laughed at it more than I have done for ages. I know how easy it is for people to compare this to 'Antz' but I find this more memorable than 'Antz' if not quite as entertaining as the 'Toy Story' franchise.The animation is just as good as that in the first 'Toy Story' film with the ants looking more colourful if more cartoonish than those in 'Antz,' the grasshoppers looking more realistic, luscious natural backgrounds and a creative use of junk to make it look like a city. The water droplets were also well-made. It wasn't until today's viewing that I noticed this film was loosely based on Aesop's fable 'The Ant and the Grasshopper' and the story is pretty straightforward in terms of Flik searching for more bugs to help the colony gather more food for the grasshoppers after he accidentally knocks the first batch into the stream. Other parts I found funny were Harry getting zapped by the bug light and one glow-ant telling the other to turn his butt off. The dialogue is memorable for the most part with some funny and clever lines. I liked the use of 'Bug-eat-bug world' as opposed to 'Dog-eat-dog world' as well as a mosquito ordering an O-positive Bloody Mary at the bar. While there were only two songs used in the entire film, I liked Randy Newman's closing credits song but the most memorable piece of incidental music was unfortunately the most repetitive since it was used about four times throughout the film to accompany scenes such as Flik setting out to find more bugs, Flik returning with the circus bugs and the ending. The voice acting is very good. Dave Foley, although lesser known, gave Flik his touch of ambition and determination; Julia Louis-Dreyfus, also lesser known, gave Princess Atta heart; Kevin Spacey was menacing as Hopper; and Hayden Panettiere, who later went on to play Channing in 'Racing Stripes' and cheerleader Claire in television series 'Heroes,' was cute as Dot. I also liked the late Joe Ranft's German accent for Heimlich and John Ratzenberger was virtually unrecognisable as P.T. Flea but did a good job voicing him nonetheless. Overall, this didn't entertain me quite as much as the 'Toy Story' franchise did but it is better than its accompanying short film 'Geri's Game' and 'Antz.' 9/10.",9,0,0,6 July 2014
Toy Story," A nostalgic start to Pixar's best film franchise
","I very fondly remember watching this film as a child and to this day it it still one of Pixar's finest efforts, especially if it's their first feature-length animation.As for the animation, it is pretty impressive for 1995 and the most realistically-modelled toys are Etch-A-Sketch and Mr Potato Head, although the main toys Woody and Buzz are well-designed as well. There are some funny moments such as Mr Potato Head pretending to be a Picasso painting and Sid's sister Hannah dressing Buzz up as a woman and naming him Mrs Nesbitt at a tea party as well as some dark, sinister moments such as Sid making mutant toys that eventually scare him off and the tense moment of Woody and Buzz's rivalry including the memorable, 'You are a toy!' line. Other lines I remember from this film are Buzz's catchphrase 'To infinity and beyond' and Woody's many phrases such as 'You're my favourite deputy' and 'There's a snake in my boots' to name just two. The opening scene involving Andy playing with Woody accompanied by Randy Newman's 'You've Got A Friend In Me' is one of the film's most captivating parts and I liked the product placement of toy manufacturers (Rex being made by Mattel and Mr Potato Head being made by Playskool).Overall, this is a dark and funny start to my favourite trilogy of animated films. 10/10.",10,0,0,10 August 2013
Toy Story 2," Better than the first and nearly as good as the third
","I remember seeing this film in the cinema when I was 12 and I found it hilarious if moving in parts.The animation has improved slightly over that in the first and I like the addition of new characters such as Jessie, Bullseye, Stinky Pete, Wheezy the Penguin, Zurg, Mrs Potato Head, Al and Barbie. I also like Andy's Dachsund Buster, who was briefly mentioned at the end of the first film. My favourite moments of this film include Jessie's poignant back-story about a girl called Emily who loved her and its accompanying song 'When She Loved Me,' Barbie giving a tour around the toy shop in the style of an open-top bus tour and the luggage conveyor belt sequence in the airport, which led to the funny moment of a little girl finding Stinky Pete in her backpack and calling him a 'big ugly man doll.' The out takes at the end were pant-wettingly funny, in fact I laughed so hard at them that I was on the verge of wetting myself. Also keep your eyes peeled for a cameo from Geri from 'Geri's Game' when he fixes Woody in preparation for his shipment to the museum...All in all, this is a funny if heartbreaking addition to the 'Toy Story' franchise. 10/10.",10,0,1,10 August 2013
There's Something About Mary," A funny and gross rom-com where Diaz, Stiller and Dillon well and truly shine
","I first heard of this film when I was in my first year at secondary school, even though I was too young to watch it at that time, upon seeing a promotional poster for this film and it was also the first time I'd ever heard of Cameron Diaz, who is one of my all-time favourite actresses. I finally saw this film when I was 15 when my mum bought the video shortly before Diaz's 30th birthday and I bought the DVD myself a couple of months after.While this film has a lot of funny moments, there are a couple of scenes I didn't like such as the 'frank and beans' in the zipper scene in the 1985 flashback and another scene that had excessive swearing. I did, however, like the infamous 'hair gel' scene that was parodied in the music video to 'Say You'll Be Mine' video by Steps (one of my favourite pop groups) where Claire Richards was Cameron Diaz/Mary and Lee Latchford Evans was Ben Stiller/Ted. The majority of the flashback was watchable with the exception of the 'frank and beans' scene I've already mentioned and the scenes involving the mishaps of Puffy the Border terrier being drugged up by Pat were hilarious if sad and hysterical but the first instance of this ended on a cute note when Pat had him 'wrapped up like a baby' much to Magda's delight. Although Cameron Diaz, Ben Stiller and Matt Dillon are the standouts, I also liked the support from Lee Evans as Tucker, Lin Shaye as Magda and W Earl Brown as Mary's brother Warren.Overall this is a funny film that has its fair share of memorable moments, romance and gross-out humour. 8/10.",8,1,1,10 August 2013
Up," A bittersweet yet adventurous Disney Pixar film
","I have seen this film three times so far; once when my mum rented it, the second time on a plane to Dubai and the third time upon renting it myself. It is one of Pixar's best and it is better than 'Cars,' 'The Incredibles' and 'Ratatouille,' on par with 'A Bug's Life,' 'Finding Nemo,' 'Monsters, Inc.' and 'Wall-E' and nearly as good as the 'Toy Story' franchise.This film has a fine mix of laugh-out-loud funny moments that totally save the film from being too boring (especially the scenes involving the talking dogs) and heartbreaking moments (the passing of Ellie at the end of the montage between her and Carl, which made my mum cry as well as the later scene where Carl looks at pictures of himself and Ellie in her Adventure Book) as well as a great variety of characters, beautifully-rendered backgrounds, in particular the surroundings of South America, and vibrant colours (especially the balloons that lift Carl's house and Kevin). Not only were the surroundings of South America beautifully rendered, but they are also realistic due to some of the film makers visiting Venezuela themselves. While a number of characters were modelled around basic shapes (Carl's square-shaped head and Russell's more rounded physique), they still had their distinct personalities such as Carl's grumpy- old-man yet ambitious nature, Russell's excitable yet assistive traits and Charles Muntz's good-guy-turned-evil character. If I could point out any flaws, they would be the fact that Muntz is still alive when Carl meets him in person, Dug's rather unfunny squirrel joke and Carl throwing the furniture out of his house to make it float again when there are still some balloons tied inside it. This made no sense at first but today I realised he did it since there were fewer balloons. I also found the cut on a man's head a bit too much for a family film after Carl hits him with his walking stick. Other than the flaws, there are some more positive points such as the Easter Egg of Lotso Huggin' Bear from 'Toy Story 3' in the little girl's bedroom during the first house-flight scene, a picture of Dug finally chasing a squirrel during the end credits, the end credits themselves looking like a scrapbook (which I thought were as unique as the end credits of 'Kung-Fu Panda') and the music which was jolly, tense and poignant in different places. I especially liked the incidental music during the Carl and Ellie montage because it is nostalgic-sounding and memorable.On the whole, this is an entertaining film that is adventurous, funny and moving all at the same time. 9/10.",9,0,1,6 August 2013
WALL·E," My second favourite sci-fi film after E.T. with great futuristic visuals, music and touching moments
","While E.T. will always remain my favourite sci-fi film (despite not being a big fan of the genre), I rented 'Wall-E' about four years ago due to not seeing it at the cinema in the summer of 2008 because I spent a lot of time indoors to avoid stressful moments involving families with children. Another reason for seeing this film is because I love Pixar films, especially the 'Toy Story, franchise and I enjoyed 'Robots' that came out three years earlier.The film's set-up that I heard about through its publicity is pretty straightforward in terms of involving WALL-E, a cute litter-compacting robot, doing what he was made for for 700 years and collecting interesting artifacts that he keeps in his home that he shares with his pet cockroach. Another robot, the sleek and attractive EVE, is sent to Earth to search for vegetation in order to bring the stunning ship Axiom back down to Earth. WALL-E falls for her and when he gives her a plant, she stores it inside her, goes into hibernation mode and is taken aboard the ship destined for Axiom. WALL-E clings onto the ship in a desperate attempt to rescue EVE. Upon seeing this film, there was more to the main plot such as seeing a plethora of obese people who hover aboard the Axiom and communicate via holographic screens, the captain learning more about Earth and live-action segments, particularly clips from 'Hello Dolly!' As for the music, I liked the uses of songs from 'Hello Dolly!' the '2001: A Space Odyssey' music and Peter Gabriel's closing song 'Down to Earth' to represent Axiom's return to Earth while the composition played during WALL-E and EVE flying in the starry sky is lovely. The colours are at their brightest aboard the Axiom and the impressionist art-style portion of the end-credits animations, although I liked the metallic textures used to reflect the film's sci-fi theme and the futuristic visuals. There are several heartwarming moments, especially those involving WALL-E trying to get EVE to hold hands, and a few funny moments such as WALL-E needing to recharge upon waking, the singing fish's brief rendition of 'Don't Worry, Be Happy' (the second connection between Bobby McFerrin and Pixar) and the 'beauty-bot' giving WALL-E a makeover, although the idea of growing pizza plants does not make sense because there's no such thing as pizza plants! Maybe it was included to illustrate the captain's misunderstanding of life on Earth. I found the minimal use of dialogue during the first 37 minutes effective since WALL-E and EVE could communicate with their emotions and the closing shot from Earth was just as phenomenal as the opening shot.Overall, this is an engaging sci-fi animation that offers more than I initially expected. 9/10.",9,0,1,1 September 2013
Despicable Me," One of the most creative animated films with an original concept if somewhat similar to 'Megamind'
","I saw this in the cinema three years ago when I could watch it in 3D, the best part with that effect being the roller coaster scene. Re-visiting this film today I had the same feeling about it as 'A Turtle's Tale: Sammy's Adventures' by enjoying the 3D version more but I still found it as creative and funny as ever.The animation standard is on the same level as Pixar and Dreamworks CGI films with oddly-designed yet appealing characters, original weapons, a combination of modern, retro and futuristic backgrounds, some clever uses of colour such as Vector's orange suit matching his couch and other belongings and some realistic elements such as the moon and the pyramids despite the one Vector stole being thinly disguised amongst the sky. The story has an original concept of a villain as a protagonist in a similar manner to 'Megamind,' although the opening scene of the soft pyramid looked as if belonged to a different film altogether. While the girls' names are old-fashioned, they have their own personalities (the smart Margo, the tomboyish Edith and the adorable, unicorn- loving Agnes) and make the film worthwhile. The musical score is powerful and reminds me of the sort of music one would hear in a spy or mystery film. It even includes hints of disco music. Other aspects that made this film worth watching were the minions (they were all funny and in my favourite colour yellow), Dr Nefario's misunderstandings of Gru's demands (boogie robots instead of cookie robots for example), the 'Annie' reference, the use of the famous Wilhelm scream when Gru's mother hits the punch-bag and sends the instructor flying and the hilarity of Agnes puckling her cheeks when she asks if it counts as annoying. There was also an element of visual trickery with Edith briefly becoming trapped inside Gru's iron maiden along with other dark moments such as Miss Hattie keeping girls inside the Box of Shame and Gru leaving out food and water bowls as well as newspaper for a toilet for the girls because he perceives them as animals to begin with. Some parts of the film were slow and initially forgettable but these are balanced by the stronger scenes I have already mentioned. While Steve Carell seemed unrecognisable, he played his most unique role yet as Gru while Russell Brand was superb as Dr Nefario and Julie Andrews was a pleasant surprise as Gru's mother. The voice actresses for the girls did a solid job as well, especially Elsie Fisher as Agnes.In spite of this film being more enjoyable in 3D, it still entertained me and I hope to see the sequel soon. 8/10.",8,1,1,29 November 2013
The Iron Giant," An underrated animated gem from the late 90s
","I fondly remember watching this when I was about 12 or 13 and like 'The Magic Sword: Quest for Camelot,' this is another animated film from my youth I had forgotten about for several years until the Nostalgia Critic reminded me of it by placing it at no. 6 in his 'Top 11 Underrated Classics,' which also included the likes of 'The Prince of Egypt' and 'Babe: Pig in the City' that I had also seen during my pre-teen years.So back to 'The Iron Giant.' The animation was mostly smooth but jarring in places and there seemed to be a continuity error with regard to Hogarth's eyes - in some shots they had pupils in others they didn't. Other than the jarring movements and alleged continuities, the Iron Giant blended with the 2D animation perfectly since he didn't look anything like a CGI character and I liked the black and white animated segments that were used for the televisions and the bombing protection public information film shown at Hogarth's school. The film, although animated, had some realistic elements such as the Iron Giant eating metal that stayed true to the Iron Man eating metal in the Ted Hughes book and reminded me of a task I did at primary school where we were put into pairs and had to create a menu for the Iron Man that included ingredients such as chicken wire and oil. There were also some realistic and effective uses of colour and lighting such as the camera pan from a sunset sky to an autumnal landscape and the pale blue lighting as Hogarth followed the Iron Giant to an electric substation. The incidental music was initially forgettable but I found it fitting to the story when I re-visited the film this evening. As for the story itself, I found it a creative spin on the Hughes book that had a mixture of funny, somewhat crude and touching moments; the funny ones including the squirrel running rampage around the diner; the crude ones including Hogarth pretending to suffer from constipation as he tries to push the Iron Giant's hand out of the bathroom window and later sprinkling 'Coco-Lax' onto Kent's drink; and the touching ones including Hogarth's ever- increasing friendship with the Iron Giant and teaching him about death being a part of life upon witnessing a deer having been shot (it's Bambi all over again albeit less powerful. The story also has some educational value, especially Hogarth teaching the Iron Giant about the human world around him and that killing people or animals is a bad thing. Moving on to the voice acting, Jennifer Aniston as Hogarth's mother Annie and Vin Diesel, who pulled off the Iron Giant's voice as well as Robby Benson did with the Beast's voice in 'Beauty and the Beast,' were the standouts but Harry Connick Jr. as Dean and Eli Marienthal as Hogarth also did a great job with their roles. The ending of the missile destroying the Iron Giant, a statue of him being unveiled in the park and his separate parts moving in Iceland is unforgettable and moving without being too sentimental. I can even remember calling the film's setting Roswell instead of Rockwell as corrected by my then-babysitter and it was thoughtful of the film makers to dedicate this film to the memory of Ted Hughes during the closing credits.To conclude, I originally gave this an 8/10 due to finding some scenes more memorable than others but I upgraded it to a 9 because I enjoyed watching this even more than I did when I was a pre-teen/teenager.",9,1,2,30 December 2013
Mary and Max," A standout animated masterpiece with humorous and moving moments plus a character I could easily relate to
","I first heard of this film when I was doing research for a digital video project at college where I wanted to determine if African care staff had a sound understanding of autism and Asperger syndrome (which I have as well as Max in the film) and I watched the clip where Max reveals his diagnosis of Asperger's to Mary so I could analyse his traits. Two years ago I rented it and found it thoroughly enjoyable apart from being dissatisfied by the ending. Last year I discovered an Internet video review series called 'Jambareeqi Reviews,' which Jambareeqi mentioned on the IMDb message boards. I was intrigued and the first review of his I saw was for this film. Despite his review for this film being somewhat more favourable than mine, I was surprised when he said he had Asperger syndrome himself but reassured as well. When purchasing this DVD this week, I watched it and made notes on it, particularly those about Max's Asperger traits, in preparation for my dissertation on the portrayal of autism and Asperger syndrome in the media when I start back at university this autumn. I found this film slightly more enjoyable second time around despite noticing a flaw that I hadn't noticed first time around.That particular flaw was with the opening music. While it is a beautiful, melodic piano and string-led piece, it was repetitive since it was used more than once throughout the film. Other pieces of music I liked were the same piece used for the theme tune of 'The Apprentice,' the piano-led piece played just before Max informs Mary of his Asperger's, the song 'Que Sera Sera' and the music played over the closing credits. Despite the slight musical weakness, this film has plenty of positive aspects such as its animation, its voice acting and its narrative. The stop-motion animation is similar to that used in Adam Elliot's other work 'Harvie Krumpet (which I saw a short clip of on a DVD I purchased several years ago to raise money for an appeal for the 2004 tsunami) and it is different from the style used for Aardman. There are also some segments of 2D animation that are used for Mary and Max's favourite cartoon 'The Noblets' and pictures accompanying what Mary writes in her first letter to Max. While the colour scheme may be a little on the dull side, I liked Mary's scenes being made in sepia tone and Max's being made in black and white to distinguish the difference between their worlds. There are a few bright red elements as well such as Vera's lips and Max's pom pom that Mary makes him. The narrative was engaging, especially when Mary and Max wrote to each other and the narration from Barry Humphries was simple yet effective. The voice acting was just as good as the narrative. As for the titular characters, I can definitely relate to Max in such ways as disliking crowds and loud, sudden noises and Mary is an adorable young girl who I deeply sympathise with and her adulthood was a nice surprise despite her heartache in terms of losing her parents and her husband leaving her for another man. While I was dissatisfied with the ending on my first viewing, I found it moving the second time around. Not only does the film deal with serious issues such as alcoholism, obesity, loneliness, depression, attempted suicide, bereavement, drug abuse, Asperger syndrome and mental health conditions but there is also the odd humorous moment.In spite of the flaws regarding the music and the ending, 'Mary and Max' is an engaging feature-length stop-motion animation that ran at a steady pace, dealt with serious issues in a realistic and sensitive way, featured a character I could easily relate to and also featured some worthy side-characters such as Ivy and Mary's parents. 9/10.",9,1,3,18 July 2014
Shrek," A funny, feel-good start to Dreamworks' best film franchise
","The first time I'd ever heard of this film was on a bus advertisement when I was 14 and I misread the title as 'Shreik' but upon close inspection, it actually said 'Shrek' and it appealed to me due to its well-known voice cast (Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy). I saw this at the cinema with my volunteer/social worker and we both enjoyed it. The part where Princess Fiona kicked Robin Hood and his Merry Men out of the way was the one that made me laugh the most during my first viewing. The animation style is realistic for a Dreamworks film, particularly the human character designs and the backgrounds. The dialogue is funny and memorable if heartbreaking in places (particularly Fiona revealing to Donkey that she turns into an ogre at sunset) and while the film may not contain original side-characters due to them already existing in other stories, the story is original for a fairytale-themed film due to Shrek rescuing Fiona instead of a prince. While the most memorable piece of incidental music is the one being played while Fiona sings to a bird and makes it explode (it sounds like the Dreamworks logo music), the soundtrack consisting of rock and pop songs was more memorable. My favourite songs on the soundtrack were the opening song 'All Star' by Smash Mouth, Donkey's brief sing-song of Willie Nelson's 'On The Road Again,' the piña colada song played when Lord Farquaad chooses Fiona in the style of a 'Blind Date' spoof, John Cale's version of 'Hallelujah (I mistakenly thought this was Rufus Wainwright's version), Joan Jett's 'Bad Reputation,' the amusing ditty sung by the Duloc puppets, 'I'm On My Way' by the Proclaimers and Smash Mouth's version of 'I'm A Believer' at the end. Shrek is selfish yet endearing and Myers gives him a pretty decent Scottish accent, Murphy is hyper yet comical as Donkey, Diaz is recognisable and heartfelt as Fiona and Lithgow, while not the most well-known of the main cast, is menacing as Farquaad.Overall this is a hilarious, feel-good start to my favourite Dreamworks animated film franchise and is my second favourite in the 'Shrek' quadrilogy with the second one being the best. 10/10.",10,1,2,14 April 2014
Bruce Almighty," One of Carrey's finest
","I've seen this film a few times already. Sure it's not quite as funny as 'Dumb and Dumber' but it still has its laughs and memorable moments.The best-known cast members in this film are Jim Carrey as the titular character, Jennifer Aniston as his girlfriend Grace who is a kindergarten teacher, Morgan Freeman as God (a rather unusual choice but supportive nonetheless) and Steve Carell as Bruce's colleague Evan (who went on to star in his own film as a sequel to this one). As for its memorable moments, these include the giant cookie world record attempt at the beginning, Bruce's dog 'using the bathroom' in the house and Bruce eventually getting him to 'do his thing' outside, Bruce reporting at Niagra Falls whilst wearing an umbrella hat (which I thought he called New York by mistake), a long drawer coming out of a filing cabinet and pushing Bruce along, Grace noticing that her boobs had got bigger overnight, Grace preventing a child from eating paste at kindergarten, another child overhearing Bruce say a** and Bruce telling him he was talking about a donkey, the homeless man holding signs with phrases like 'R EWE BLIND?,' 'THY KINGDUM COME' and 'ARMAGEDDON OUTTA HERE,' and last but not least Bruce causing Evan to mess up during his news report, which was probably the most amusing scene in the entire film.Overall, this is a fine outing from Jim Carrey with a talented supporting cast. 8/10.",8,2,2,19 August 2013
Monsters University," Not as good as 'Monsters, Inc.' but it still has colourful monsters and hilarious moments
","I saw this film at the cinema with my mum today and I enjoyed it but not quite as much as 'Monsters, Inc.' My mum didn't enjoy it as much as I did and she felt that the story got lost halfway through but I didn't notice that.The pros of this film include some of the same colourful monsters as the first film that were fun to spot; their quirky designs, the elaborate surroundings of Monsters University, scenes that took place at Monsters, Inc. itself; the outstanding voice acting, particularly from John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Helen Mirren, Bob Peterson and John Ratzenberger as Sulley, Mike, Hardscrabble, Roz and the Yeti/Abominable Snowman respectively; and some funny moments, especially Sulley trying to catch the pig-monster, Hardscrabble's screamer going haywire (despite its explosion scaring me a bit) and Randall coming out of a scare room covered in hearts. I also liked the support from Hardscrabble, Scott AKA Squishy and his mother. The cons include my mum's view of the story getting lost in the middle, the story not being as engaging or thrilling as that in the original despite having some moments that made me jump and the soundtrack being pretty generic and having a similar structure to musical scores of other films but my mum danced to the jazzy music over the end credits.Overall this didn't offer the same entertainment value as the original but it's not bad for a first Pixar prequel. 8/10.",8,0,0,18 September 2013
Toy Story 3," Best one in the trilogy!
","I've always been a fan of Disney Pixar films, most notably Finding Nemo, the first two Toy Story films, The Incredibles, Wall-E, Up and A Bug's Life, but this one's phenomenal and I've seen it four times so far: once at the cinema in 3D (which was really good); once when my mum rented it while I was staying at her house; once on my flight home from Dubai and just recently when I rented it myself. This film is so amazing I'm seriously considering purchasing it in a triple pack along with the first two.There are several redeeming qualities in this film such as the opening scene involving Andy's toys in a western film scenario, some humorous lines, Buzz Lightyear in Spanish mode, references to the previous two films (such as the aliens pointing out, 'the claw!' and Jessie moaning, 'It's Emily all over again!' when referring to her previous owner she sang about in Toy Story 2) and new characters such as the good-bear-turned-bad Lotso Hugging Bear, the shy but adorable Bonnie and Barbie's new love interest, Ken - that doll's house scene where Ken models his outfits for Barbie is priceless! Although certain characters from the previous films are missing (Bo Peep, Etch-a-Sketch and Weezy) due to having been sold, it still includes my favourite characters of Woody, Buzz and Jessie. I also liked the bittersweet feel of the film due to its inclusion of happy and sad moments. Even though I didn't cry at this film, I found the back story of Lotso Hugging Bear, Big Baby and Bonnie's toy clown Chuckles very moving as well as the ending scene where Andy gives all his toys to Bonnie. In addition to the redeeming qualities I've already mentioned, I liked seeing the teenage Andy, pre-teen Molly and older Buster, who was hilarious when moving slowly inside Andy's room. Also look out for a near-cameo appearance of Totoro from Hayao Miyazaki's masterpiece!Overall, this is a brilliant film that has all the aspects I look for in an animated film. 10/10.",10,0,2,17 June 2013
Cinderella," Another childhood classic from Disney
","Along with 'Peter Pan' and 'The Little Mermaid,' 'Cinderella' was one of my favourite Disney films as a child. This film was engaging for the most part, but I feel that the announcement of the ball took longer than it should have done due to a somewhat overlong segment of Cinderella doing her duties and a couple of the scenes involving the king and the duke were slightly irrelevant to the film's main plot. The mice were hard to understand when I heard them speak for the first time in this film for several years but they were cute, funny and active supporting characters nonetheless. Also the film's location setting (probably a toss-up between France and the Netherlands) and time period are hard to determine. The ending was rushed yet memorable with some twists and turns leading up to it.The best aspects of this film were the prologue that consists of a moving back-story of Cinderella and her step-family; beautiful illustrations; very young versions of Cinderella and her stepsisters and simple animation, which got better as the film progressed; the memorable songs (In particular the opening song, 'A Dream is a Wish,' 'Sing Sweet Nightingale,' the brief song sung by the mice before they made Cinderella's dress, 'Bibbidy Bobbidy Boo' and the song that plays when Cinderella dances with the prince); the bubble sequence during 'Sing Sweet Nightingale;' the dressmaking scene and the Fairy Godmother scene. In conclusion, this film isn't quite as enjoyable as 'Peter Pan' and 'The Little Mermaid,' but it was worth another look after several years. 8/10.",8,1,2,26 May 2013
Aladdin," A mostly memorable Disney Renaissance feature from my childhood with a great soundtrack
","Alongside 'The Little Mermaid,' 'Peter Pan' and 'Cinderella,' I enjoyed watching this film as a child and I can even remember a lady who used to work with my siblings and me when we were younger giving us a copy of the video. I also received the Musical Masterpiece edition on DVD that came with a free lyrics book a few Christmases ago. This film also has one of the best soundtracks that is on par with those from 'The Little Mermaid (my mum's favourite Disney film and one of mine),' 'Pocahontas (my sister's favourite and also one of mine)', and 'The Lion King (one of my housemate's favourite Disney films as well as this one)'. My top three songs here are 'A Whole New World (the version in the film itself and also the closing credits version plus its beautiful matching incidental music version),' 'Friend Like Me' and 'Prince Ali.' The opening song 'Arabian Nights' was the most authentic-sounding of them all. The rest of the incidental music by Alan Menken was tense and poignant at the right moments if somewhat generic. While this film is memorable for the most part, I found certain scenes and the song 'One Jump Ahead' forgettable, which are some of my only complaints.Gripes aside for the time being, this film has many positive aspects such as the animation being fluid, detailed and smooth, some stunning backgrounds such as the Cave of Wonders, the palace and its surrounding garden and a mixture of funny and serious moments, the former including antics from the Genie, Abu and Iago and the latter involving Jasmine disagreeing with the rules about marriage. I also liked the fourth wall joke of the camera coming too close to the man introducing the story at the beginning - that really cracked me up. The climax with Jafar, one of Disney's most menacing villains, turning into a snake was creepy yet outstanding. Further to the rest of the characters, Aladdin is a handsome hero, Jasmine is beautiful, sensitive and a bit tough whilst becoming Disney's first non-white princess, Sultan is a strict yet supportive father figure to Jasmine, Abu is mischievous yet cute and funny while the Genie and Iago are as comical as their antics. I also liked the humanistic animation on the magic carpet when it is first introduced. As for the voice acting, Scott Weigner as Aladdin, Linda Larkin as Jasmine, Jonathan Freeman as Jafar, Gilbert Gottfried as Iago and Douglas Seal as Sultan all did respectable jobs with their roles but the standouts were Robin Williams who was humorous as the Genie and the prolific Frank Welker, who provided realistic vocal effects and minor speech for Abu and a sinister, growly voice for the Cave of Wonders. Like the scenes and songs, most of the script is memorable despite including some clichÃ©d moments such as Jafar yelling, 'No!' when he realises he no longer has the lamp he snatched from Aladdin whilst disguised as an old man (reminds me of the Queen in Snow White disguising herself as an old hag) and the playing of the 'liar revealed' trope when Jafar reveals 'Prince Ali's' true identity to Jasmine; however I like the script including references to other Disney films such as 'The Little Mermaid' when the Genie pulls Sebastian out of a recipe book and possibly 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' (as I already mentioned earlier) and 'The Sword in the Stone' just before Aladdin grabs the magic lamp. The pace is just right as well - the songs just made it fly by.All in all this is a very enjoyable Disney Classic from my childhood with stunning animation, a superb soundtrack and some funny moments. 9/10.",9,1,2,14 March 2014
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," On par with the first two but is probably the funniest with the best soundtrack since the second
","I rented this DVD to see what it was like compared to the first two I had seen at the cinema and it is just as good. The first fifteen minutes were filled with laugh-out loud moments such as Alex imagining himself and the other three main animals as elderly animals, the lemurs jumping out of Alex's birthday cake that had a sense of scatological humour (Mort vomiting pink icing) and the antics in the casino and the possible parody of 'The Matrix' involving the monkeys shooting from 'banana guns,' thus making these the funniest first fifteen minutes in the entire 'Madagascar' franchise. As for the soundtrack, this has the best of all three 'Madagascar' films. Its highlights were the opening African-inspired music; the spy-movie-type music playing as the four main animals swim towards the hotel in Monte Carlo; sing-songs of 'Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now),' 'Wannabe,' 'What's New Pussycat?,' 'New York, New York' from the 1949 film 'On The Town' and 'Hot In Herre (in which King Julien replaces, 'so take off all your clothes' with 'so take off all your fur'); the piece of classical music played over the shot of the Colliseum; Chantal's rendition of Edith Piaf's 'Je Ne Regrette Rien;' the brief Psycho-sounding music playing before the lemurs encounter the bear on the train; Yolanda Be Cool's 'We No Speak Americano;' Katy Perry's 'Firework;' and last but not least, 'I Like To Move It (probably the signature song of the 'Madagascar' franchise)' mixed with typical circus music. The character animation is on par with that in the first two and while the film includes my favourite characters of the main four, the penguins, the monkeys and the lemurs, I also liked the side characters consisting of circus animals (especially Gia and Stefano) and dogs. Chantal was a menacing villain and while I was initially worried when she rolled on the train track in case she got electrocuted or run over by a train she was okay, although her most amusing moments involved shooting various Italian police officers with tranquillisers, getting shot in the bottom with one herself towards the end and being shipped towards Madagascar in crates along with other human characters in a similar manner to the main animals in the original. I must admit I do miss the presence of the elderly woman who called Alex a 'bad Kitty' in the first two films because she was comical. There is a wide variety of backgrounds such as the picturesque surroundings of Monte Carlo and the mountains as well as a lovely flythrough of London at night with Big Ben and the London Eye being beautifully illuminated. The interior circus scenes in the latter half use beautiful fluorescent lighting too.Moving onto the dialogue, it is as smart and witty as that in the first two films, especially Stefano's line 'My tears are real, you're not!' when the four main animals reveal they are zoo animals rather than circus animals, which makes this a typical use of the 'liar revealed' trope. The script also mentions clichés such as Chantal labelling the idea of running away from the circus as one. I also liked Alex mentioning his ancestors (I.e. other lions) used to perform at the Colliseum and one of the circus animals saying, 'That's Bolshevik!' as a play on a profanity. As usual, the voice acting from Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett-Smith, David Schwimmer and Sacha Baron Cohen was superb as was Frances McDormand voicing Chantal with a convincing French accent. I also liked Stefano and Gia's Italian accents.Overall this is an amusing third instalment of the franchise with the creme de la creme consisting of the witty dialogue, the character animation and the soundtrack. 8/10.",8,1,2,5 January 2014
Happy Feet," A realistic and stunning film with a valuable environmental message
","I first saw this film with a staff member from my former care home when it came out in 2006 and we both enjoyed it. I watched this again today when I rented it after having already rented 'Happy Feet Two,' which is just as good with some parts better than others.The penguins, birds, leopard seal, elephant seals, killer whales and backgrounds were realistically modelled and rendered with true-to-life colours. Although the dark scene during 'Somebody To Love' was the least detailed part of the film, it was saved by the beautiful green lighting that resembled the Northern Lights, the lovely singing and the amazing choreography, particularly from Mumble. While he is unable to sing, he can still tap dance very well. He and Gloria were cute as children while Ramón and his Amigos were amusing. Besides 'Somebody To Love,' my favourite musical numbers by the penguins were 'Kiss/Let's Talk About Sex (which was changed to something else to make it more family friendly),' 'Boogie Wonderland,' 'If You Leave Me Now' and 'I Wish.' Further to Ramon and his amigos, it was funny when one of them called the leopard seal, 'rubber butt' and also when they tried to run away from him in a way that played with the slow motion cliché. Another cliché that was played with was 'liar revealed' when Mumble was mouthing to Ramon's Spanish version of 'My Way' in order to impress Gloria. This film has some stunning and thrilling scenes such as Mumble jumping out of the water and saying, 'Watcha waiting for?' (which made me think he initially sang Gwen Stefani's 'What You Waiting For) thus leading to him and the other penguins swimming underwater to the Beach Boy's wonderfully harmonious and underrated 'Do It Again;' the sliding scene with Mumble and the Amigos albeit causing an apparent avalanche; Mumble and the Amigos being flipped and nearly eaten by two killer whales; and the inclusion of live action elements, especially zoo visitors watching Mumble dancing. I loved Mumble's interpretation of them as aliens and his own language as 'plain penguin' as opposed to 'plain English' due to the visitors interpreting his plea to stop overfishing as squawks. The environmental message of not overfishing and polluting the Antarctic are valuable but Lovelace being choked by the six-pack ring may be distressing for very young children and certain parts of the film may be too daunting for them. They may also find the scene of Mumble being washed up on the beach and put in captivity confusing and I can actually remember a child asking his/her parents if Mumble was dead at the cinema. As an adult, I found the elephant seals confusing because I couldn't tell which was which and I saw that they had similar-sounding names in the end credits. I also found the ending rather abrupt and baby Erik, who has a larger role in the sequel, was hard to spot.In spite of the abrupt ending and certain parts being distressing, confusing and daunting for very young children, this film deserves an 8/10 for realistic visuals, beautiful musical numbers, impeccable choreography and a valuable environmental message.",8,1,1,13 September 2013
Pocahontas," Not only a childhood favourite of mine but also my sister's favourite Disney film with good music and beautiful animation
","I remember seeing this in the cinema with my mother and my sister when we visited my grandparents in London back in 1995 when I was eight and my sister was four going on five. While I enjoyed this film for the most part as a child, I didn't like the ending because I was worried that John Smith was going to die and I remember telling my late grandmother how sad the ending was. Last Christmas I was trying to work out what the favourite Disney films of mine and my relatives were and while my top three are 'The Little Mermaid,' 'Oliver and Company' and 'Peter Pan' (this would probably be in my top ten), my mum's favourite is 'The Little Mermaid (in spite of me thinking her favourite was 'Beauty and the Beast')' and as per the summary of this review, my sister's favourite is this one despite me mistaking it was 'Cinderella.' This week, I re-visited this film twice; once with my mother when she recorded it from Channel 5 (although I only watched it from 'Colours of the Wind,' one of the best songs here, on that occasion) and today whilst renting the DVD. When finishing the viewing of this film, it was as good as I remembered albeit some forgettable scenes and songs due to not having seen this for a while.The best aspects of this film are its animation and music. The animation is up to Disney's usual standards with the character designs of the native Americans being completely different from those of the English settlers in this film and any other Disney Renaissance film character; picturesque backgrounds; and some beautiful, warm uses of colour, particularly the leaves that blow around Pocahontas and the sunrise/sunset scenes. As for the music, most of the songs are more memorable than the incidental music. Not only did I like 'Colours of the Wind' but also 'Just Around the River Bend,' 'Mine, Mine, Mine,' 'Steady as the Beating Drum' and 'Savages,' which are also good. While the incidental music was initially forgettable, it had its moments of charm, beauty and tension and I liked the instrumental reprise of 'Colours of the Wind' towards the end. I have just learnt that the song 'If I Never Knew You' was not featured in the original theatrical release of this film but it is lovely nonetheless. The film ran at a fast pace throughout and while a lot of people say the story is historically inaccurate in parts, it is still engaging and carries some valuable messages about cultural diversity and choosing one's own path, although the scene where Pocahontas and John Smith introduced each other didn't go anywhere. I also liked the opening and closing shots looking like sepia tone sketches, which was a new and different way to depict them instead of using the traditional storybook method. Pocahontas and John Smith are both kind-hearted characters, Nakoma, Kocoum and Powhatan are supportive, Grandmother Willow is gentle and encouraging, John Ratcliffe is gluttonous and menacing while Percy, Meeko and Flit are all cute and comical. The voice acting is very good, although I wasn't sure if Mel Gibson as John Smith was meant to sound British or American but I liked Billy Connoly's voice for Ben, David Ogden Stiers as Ratcliffe and Irene Bedard, while not one of the world's best-known voice actresses, as Pocahontas as well as Judy Khun providing her singing voice.To conclude, this is one of Disney's most unique films with a heartfelt story, a good soundtrack on the whole and a valuable message. 9/10.",9,1,3,24 May 2014
The Simpsons Movie," The best animated film of 2007
","As a lifelong fan of 'The Simpsons,' I really wanted to see this film when It was released in the cinema. After having seen it for the first time back in 2007, I didn't regret it.This film has just about everything that was featured in the television series as well as references to other films such as 'Snow White,' 'Titanic' and 'An Inconvenient Truth.' There are tons of sight gags that made me laugh such as the infamous nude skateboarding scene that gained a lot of media attention in the run-up to its release and this film also has clever writing that links scenes very well such as Grampa foreseeing the disasters of Homer polluting the lake with the silo containing Spider-Pig/Plopper's droppings and Springfiled being sealed in a dome; and Homer riding a motorcycle inside a spherical cage and eventually inside the dome during the climax. As well as its humorous moments, this film has touching and tense moments. The backgrounds range from the familiar sights of Springfield to the beautiful surroundings of Alaska. There are also some well-known celebrity cameos such as the rock band Green Day and Tom Hanks. The 20th Century Fox opening logo with Ralph Wiggum was hilarious as well as the post-credit antics of 'The Simpsons' who have appeared to be watching their own movie all along.Overall, this is one of my all time favourite animated films and a brilliant spin-off of my favourite animated television series. 10/10.",10,0,1,1 July 2013
