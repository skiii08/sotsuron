First Man," No controversy here
",Spoiler alert unless you already know the story of the moon landing. I understand this is the biography of Neil Armstrong and not a documentary on the moon landing. There seems to be some controversy about the flag of the United States being shown. And it is correct that they do not show Neil planting the flag on the moon but there are plenty of references throughout the movie that clearly show this is an American achievement on behalf of all mankind. It's a good movie and the story is well told. I'm not a big fan of the many close-ups and the camera shaking all the time during action scenes. At two hours and 22 minutes it's a little long in my opinion. The personal side of the story is very moving. It will help if you know who is who before watching this. If you know the names of the other astronauts for example.,7,0,0,17 October 2018
