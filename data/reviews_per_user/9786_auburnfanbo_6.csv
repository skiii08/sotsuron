Ford v Ferrari," Top 5 Movie of the Year
","What this movie does really well is get you emotionally invested in the characters, due to great acting and strong screenwriting. They built a star studded cast for this movie with Matt Damon, Christian Bale, Jon Bernthal, etc. and it really payed off with them all giving great performances. The racing scenes were exhilirating and excellently shot with great audio editing to make you feel like you're in the car with the great Ken Miles. All of this combined makes this movie easily a top 5 movie of the year for me.",9,4,7,21 November 2019
The Village," An underrated gem
","I wasn't expecting to be blown away by this movie, but surprisingly I kind of was. The monologue in a few particular scenes was so well written, and extremely powerful. Not to mention Bryce Dallas Howard and William Hurt giving fantastic performances. The screenplay was creative and unpredictable, and the motivation behind all of the characters actions was really interesting. I thouroughly enjoyed this movie and think it deserves much more recognition.",8,5,5,21 July 2019
The Conjuring 2," Wan's sequel ups the scare factor
","James Wan is a mastermind when it comes to building suspense, and creating dreadful atmospheres in his movies, which is exactly what he does here in the Conjuring 2. The story was engrossing while simultaneously being unpredictable. The acting performances were terrific all around, with Madison Wolfe giving a great performance as the main target of the powerful demon. This movie is easily one of the most horrifying movies I have ever seen, without losing anything in terms of having a touching and complex story.",10,0,1,12 August 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Pitt and Decaprio shine for QT
","Quinten Tarantino has made a lot of good movies, but this has to be my favorite. The chemistry between Pitt and Decaprio was fantastic, along with each of the actors giving great performances. The screenplay was extremely creative, and the ending was one hell of a final scene to cap off a movie filled with plenty of comedy, and an emersive look into 1960's Hollywood.",9,34,55,26 July 2019
Midsommar," The weirdest movie you will ever enjoy
","This is just hard to rate because of how weird and psychedelic this movie was. I don't know if I could even put it into the horror category, because this movie never really scared me. The cinematography and editing was brilliant, and at no point was I bored. The run time wasn't a problem for me, because I was enjoying how different this movie was from what is usually in theaters. I wouldn't say it's great, but I also wouldn't mind watching it again at all.",7,27,60,6 July 2019
Joker," Phoenix and Phillips craft a masterpiece
","This is the greatest depiction of a comic book charachter in a movie of all time. Phoenix inhabits this man outcast by society and destined to be the greatest villain Gotham has ever known, and puts his all into it. His performance of a man who's been persecuted his whole life for his mental conditions was immaculate. He brings this charachter to life like no one ever has (Ledger included). Another aspect that can't be swept under the rug is how Impressive of a directing job Phillips did. The fact that he is able to move from directing some of the most renound comedies of all time, to crafting this intense character piece is a credit to his unbelievable skill. The Joker has always been depicted as existing in a world outside of ours, but in this dark drama it's accuratley shown what it would be like if this villain actually existed in the real world. An aspect of this film that's likely not going to get as much attention as it should from general audiences is the score. It's brilliant, and elevates this movie to a whole other level. Don't even hesitate if thinking about watching this movie, do yourself a favor and immerse yourself in this expertly conceived world.",10,2,3,4 October 2019
