Captain Phillips," The script has a couple of issues, but it's still good.
","I did like this movie, I suppose. It's pretty well acted, VERY well directed, and I really liked that we get some brief moments of sympathy with our antagonists. The introductory scene showing the Somalian's way of life right after we're shown our main American character's: clever. Some throwaway lines here and there makes you realize what our protagonist is going through is what these people go through on a daily basis and I applaud this movie for humanizing terrorists instead of making them evil for the sake of being evil. AND begin subtle about it. That's not something you see every day in a Hollywood movie.Now, I do have some problems with the script... The story needs the protagonist to be an incompetent genre-blind idiot. Otherwise, HOW THE HELL WOULD 4 PIRATES ON A MOTORBOAT YOU CLEARLY SAW COMING TAKE OVER A CARGO SHIP? You mean to tell me that an American crew, American, you know, the kind of people that would blow up their own buildings as an excuse to justify blowing up other countries, HAVE NO GUNS WHATSOEVER? Knowing that getting attacked by terrorists was a possibility in Somalian waters?And then we have an opportunity to make a hostage exchange and the captain is not smart enough to realize that these people aren't satisfied with 30000 dollars and will try to kidnap someone, so he just jumps into the freaking boat WHILE THEY STILL HAVE LEVERAGE like a moron? If you're dumb enough to fall for that, sir, you DESERVE it.And finally, TWO army ships, with an operation involving at least 70 people and all sorts of fancy military tech, just to rescue ONE GUY? It's not like he's a diplomat or a minister or anyone important, just some guy. Are you kidding me? Children die by thousands in Africa, women all over the world are being kidnapped for human trafficking but we need 70 trained professionals and at least 100000 dollars in fuel and equipment just to take one guy back from some terrorists because he was dumb enough to get caught, against all odds. Oh that's right. Because he's white and American, people care.Again, it isn't a bad film, far from it, but the script needs our main character to be an idiot and the US army to be willing to spend a small fortune to get said idiot back, otherwise the film would end when people did the sensible thing and just didn't let the Somalians board the ship to begin with. It kept bothering me and ruined the experience.",6,0,1,26 May 2014
