Hereditary," Excellent horror movie
","For anyone that likes proper horror films this is for you. If you rely on boring jump scares you will be disappointed. Unlike most horror films this has great acting, Toni Collete is brilliant throughout. Some of the scenes are the most shocking I have even seen. Great horror movie!",10,2,3,22 June 2018
