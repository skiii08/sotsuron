50 First Dates," My Thoughts on 50 First Dates
",I have read many reviews and comments made by members of IMDb.com on the thought that 50 was very or very not similar to Groundhog Day. I myself have to say that the day to day repetition was very similar amongst the two but the romantic aspect was not.True like most romantic films the realism is blown out of proportion resulting in a fairy tale based love story. But Adam Sandlers evergoing effort to strive for Drew Barrymore's love was displayed very differently than I recall in a film of the past. It was very sweet how he in the end threw aside the major issue that she would never remember him the next day but still wanted to be there for her day by day :),8,0,0,26 July 2004
