Sucker Punch," A forty something woman gives you her opinion
","Yesterday's cinema was a surprise in how damn good it was! Just thought it would be an orgy of beautiful images and action, but it had a message that I personally felt was amazing. Hope all the guys and girls, who see this incredible movie, also come to terms with what it was trying to say. Well, it was an orgy of action and great images, with great music. Yes it was very much a young man's fantasies in the women's appearance, but they were strong women, which is why I tolerated the costumes, which actually had to do with the story. And you can't go wrong when they try to say something without trying to force it on you. The girls acting achievement was perhaps not the best, but that was not what was all about. Oscar Isaac, who played nurse / pimp, was by far the most disgusting man on earth in this movie and we just wanted to beat him down. That is what I call good actor effort, to get the audience to hate you so totally, is probably not as easy as you might think. My tributes also need to include the Zack Snyder, who wrote, directed and produced this film. I have seen the movies 300 and Watchmen and I liked then and now there was a third. So I am looking forward to the next. Thanks Zack!'If you don't stand for something, you will fall for anything.'",10,8,15,16 April 2011
