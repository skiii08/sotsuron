Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Disappointed!!!
","Disappointed as there was very little 'substance' and WAY too much 'been there, done that'...Special Effects: 9 out of 10 Story Line: 6 out of 10 Acting: 5 out of 10 (except for the Queen of Naboo, she gets an 8 out of 10)I actually started nodding-off because the 'big' action sequence at the end was so much like 'killing the Death Star'... I'm going to go see it again though (to get another look at some of those special effects... especially for the VERY cool light sabre fight).The 'funny' side-kick was PATHETIC and absolutely ANNOYING, difficult to understand (the race is obviously modelled against Jamaican blacks) and just plain dumb. Young Darth Vader of course is the hero that saves the day... I hate kid-hero shows... shades of Free Willie here... eeeeechh!I would have enjoyed SOME kind of meaning to the plot line, and some thoughtful dialogue... but the film only used 'dialogue' to introduce the next special effects scene.All-in-all: 6 out of 10",6,0,1,19 May 1999
