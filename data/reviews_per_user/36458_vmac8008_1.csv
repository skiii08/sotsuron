Mission: Impossible III," I loved it-
","I was impressed by the acting, action, and passion of the film. The talent was great, and the feeling of camaraderie's amongst the crew was believable. You couldn't help but love them all. For once I loved all the women as well as the men cast. I often don't care for the leading lady WITH the leading man, but these two worked for me. Michelle grew on me as their relationship grew. At first I didn't quite I couldn't quite believe the romantic relationship, and her sitting in the chair crying didn't convince me much..why was she suddenly wearing so much makeup? When was it applied?? I loved the teamwork, clever twists, great acting,and Tom's usual power and passionate flair. I watched it twice and it was as good the second time! I would recommend it to anyone who wants a great time at the movies. I really don't care to hear about anyone's personal views about Tom's personal life. He's still greater than ever.",9,2,4,30 May 2006
