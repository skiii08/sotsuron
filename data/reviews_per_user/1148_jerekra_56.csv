The Avengers," Final piece to the Puzzle.
","Having seen all of the other Marvel films that lead to this film and being a huge Marvel Fan I was very excited to see this movie. I feel that this movie is very good and totally worth the wait.Loki comes to Earth and uses the Tesserect and his magical powers to try to take over mankind. Shield decides to put into action the Avengers plan and recruits Bruce Banner, Iron man, and Captain America to join Black Widow on a team of the best on the Earth. Thor also joins with the team later as the planet is still under his protection.This film has great flow to it. It starts off with Loki coming to Earth and then goes into each member of the Avengers joining the team. It really started strongly and I totally forgot about Thor and then he joins the team too. So a lot going on that I liked early which is important to a film like this.All of the members of the Avengers are very good. Robert Downey Jr is great once again as Stark/Iron man. Chris Evans does a good job as Captain America (but I think he was missing something tho). Hemsworth is amazing as Thor again. I like Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye but I feel that something was missing from that character as well, maybe its cause Im a pretty big Hawkeye fan. I thought Mark Ruffalo was OK, but I really liked the Hulk. And Scarlett Johansen is good and her behind is AMAZING! As far as Acton goes, this may be one of the best films I have ever seen in that regard. Tons of great action scenes in this film that I cant do justice trying to speak about. You'll just have to take my word for it.The only real complaints I have are that Loki and his army he uses to attack Earth aren't well explained. I think Loki is good, but he just doesn't come across as a formidable villain in this film or one that people even fear. I cant really say too much more about this without giving a lot away.Great movie. Great action and characters. Highly recommended.",9,3,7,25 August 2012
Alien 3," Dog Alien?
","I thought both Alien and Aliens were very good films. I had heard many reviewers state that Alien 3 is by far the worst of the entire Alien series and a terrible film. For the most part those reviewers were correct.Basically Ripley winds up a planet that is a prison for criminals. During the ship landing while she was asleep, Newt and Hicks both died. An alien managed to sneak aboard the ship and infects a dog and creates a new dog alien that starts to cause problems for everyone on this planet.First off, I have to say that the story and acting were particularly bad. Why on Earth did this prison planet have NO FREAKING WEOPONS ON IT! It made the conflict somewhat more interesting but that idea is super dumb. Also none of the supporting characters were really that interesting. I did not like how they killed off Hicks and Newt right off the bat. There is no doubt that they just killed them off because they could not get the actors that played them to appear in this film.Sigourney Weaver is pretty good as Ripley in this film, but she always is good. Still, this is her worst performance I think and I blame more of it on a bad director and script then I do on her. It is like Simon Cowell once said to a bad contestant on American Idol, 'Coaching you would be like coaching a one legged person to a gold medal in the one hundred meter dash.' If the script and plot is bad, the acting will often suffer as a result.The Alien is OK. It is kind of cool how it emerged from a different animal, this time a dog. It gets in some good action, but since the rest of the film was so bad, it really was not worth the wait at all. Also the whole alien point of view shots were kind of stupid because it made the alien seem to move much slower than they appear to in the film.So, bad plot and bad characters. Sigourney Weaver is OK and so is the alien, but I do not recommend this film.",3,31,37,20 April 2009
Gremlins," Never feed them after midnight.
","Gremlins is a highly entertaining film from the eighties. It is one of a kind as far as comedy/horror films go.A boy named Billy receives a Mogwai(little furry big eared creature) for Christmas that he names Gizmo. There are three rules for Mogwai, don't feed them after midnight, don't expose to bright lights, and don't get them wet. Gizmo accidentally does get wet and this results in more Mogwai being created. When the new Mogwai eat after midnight they turn into a larger reptilian like state that goes on a rampage and start to wreck havoc.Overall this film has a great overall story. It flows somewhat as a family film, then becomes a sort of horror and comedy film. Very unique in that it has some many genres with it.The cast is pretty good. Phoebe Cates and Zack Galligan play great lead human protagonists. Both are characters that you cheer for and can relate to. Howie Mandel is great as the voice for Gizmo and legendary voice actor Frank Welker is outstanding as he provides for the voice of the villain Stripe.The Gremlins themselves are what makes the film. They are just troublesome creatures that want to have a good time. However I do feel that Stripe and Gizmo are the only mogwai that stand out. But those two are the two that make this film enjoyable. Stripe is one of the better non human villains from a film ever.Overall, a very good film. I recommend it.",8,0,1,6 January 2011
The Incredible Hulk," Not Incredible, but pretty Good.
",Before I start this review I just want to say that I actually liked the hulk film that was made a few years ago in 2003. I liked this one too and it is better in some aspects than the other hulk film and worse than the other hulk film in some ways also.The story is basically involving Bruce Banner and how he must be on the run constantly. THis is because there are some in the military who want to use his mutation into the hulk to aid the military. One soldier in particular is infected by the same type of mutation and becomes a hulk monster whom Banner must battle to save humanity.First I should say that this film tends to try to ignore the other hulk film completely. It is a remake of sorts not a follow up. I guess this is because they felt that the other hulk film was a disappointment.I thought the beginning of the film really lacked in story. THere are some brief scenes during the opening credits that show how Banner became the hulk but for the most part during the whole film Banner is the hulk already and they do not explain how he became the hulk at all. I guess this makes sense but it got me confused. If they wanted to redo the hulk film completely wouldn't they want to show how he became the hulk in the first place? But this does lead to there being more action and I guess the people assumed that most people who are watching this film do not care too much about how Banner became the hulk and just want to see action.THere is a lot of good action in this film. I really like the bad guy in this film and how the main bad guy is another hulk like evil looking creature. The battle between Banner and the other hulk is a pretty good battle.The acting is good. Not outstanding. I liked Edward Norton a lot in 'American History X' and 'Rounders' and I thought he was a good choice to play Banner in this film. He really does an effective job portraying a man who must live with the problem he possesses and must deal with other people who want to find him due to the problem he has.Liv Tyler never has wowed me in any film I have seen her in and it was more of the same in this film. Nothing outstanding and sometimes lacking. COuld have chosen a better leading lady actor.Quickly I would just like to say I thought it was interesting how Robert Downey Jr. appears briefly as Tony Stark. That cameo I thought was awesome as it may lead to more great Marvel Films in the future.So this is a good film. Does not really do a good job explaining how Banner became the hulk but I think they did that on purpose. But the acting by Norton was good and there is a lot of good action. I recommend it.,7,5,9,10 March 2009
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Annoying Skywalker.
","I love the original Star Wars trilogy, it truly is the greatest movie series out there. So when I went to see the Phantom Menace I was expecting something great like the original three films. Soon I learned that my expectations were not to be reached.There is a lot of problems going on. The trade federation and the confederates hope to kidnap Queen Amidala of the Naboo and force her to sign a treaty to make their invasion legal. Qui Gon Jin and Obi Wan Kenobi rescue the Queen and take her to Tatooine where a young boy named Anakin soon becomes their only hope of getting her back to Coruscant.The story and plot of this film for me seemed a little too political. I have to admit that when I first saw this film I had no idea what the conflict was about. It involves taxation and invasion and a lot of political aspects. I think that for the most part the story is not really that exciting, it is more compelling in a sort of way if you understand political concepts.More so than any film I had seen up to the point when I saw this film, this film relied greatly on computer and visual effects. All of the non human characters are created by computer animation and a lot of the settings look computer animated. This film seemed to rely way too much on effects and if they spent one tenth of the time that they spent on Visual effects on the story then this film would have been way greater. If anything this film proved that a film with a great story and decent effects will always be better than a film with a decent story and phenomenal effects. Just saying.I knew that there would be some characters from the previous series as well as new ones as well. I thought that Qui Gon Jin, played by Liam Neesan, was awesome. Truly a great jedi. I thought that Obi Wan Kenobi seemed to be lacking in this film and does not get to say much and is more supporting. I really loved Natalie Portman in this film. She is as talented as an actress as she is beautiful and she is awesome as Queen Amidala.I did not like all of the characters though. Jar Jar Binks is on screen way too much. The way that he is depicted as a clumsy ignorant fool just makes me want to cry. A character like him in Star Wars just did not work for me, sure there were characters in the original series that were comical, but Jar Jar is just a joke. Also Anakin Skywalker, little Annie, just did not cut it for me. Looking at him and how he acts like an obnoxious little kid and how everyone calls him 'Annie' does not make me believe that he could ever become Darth Vader.ANother thing that is lacking in this film is the villains. The main bad guy is Darth Maul, but he only appears here and there and is not consistently felt as a threat throughout the way that Darth Vader was in the other series. Maul was great when on screen, but did not get nearly enough time. The Emperor is in it a little bit, and the Vice Roys of the Trade Federation are there but the villains could have been way better.The pod racing scene was OK. I mean, it basically is like the race in Ben Hur but with pod racers and more visual effects added. Nothing special, but OK.The lightsaber action is awesome. Especially the duel between Darth Maul and Qui Gon and Obi Wan at the end.OVerall, slightly disappointed with it. It relies on visual effects heavily and has an OK at best plot. I love some of the characters but others I can not stand. However, this is a Star Wars film nonetheless, so I will still recommend it.",8,0,1,20 April 2009
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," 'Be (Very) Good.'
","E.T. is easily one of the best movies that I have ever seen in my entire life. The story, acting, and music are all phenomenal. It truly is a masterpiece.The story is about an Extra Terristrial (E.T.) who gets left behind on Earth on accident. Soon he befriends a young boy named Elliot and the two form a friendship that changes both their lives.The story is a pretty good one. This time an alien that comes to Earth is not a bad guy or a threat. Rather it is peaceful and just wants to return home. At the beginning this film is pretty scary, but as soon as you see Elliot and E.T. become friends the film is really touching and moving and highly entertaining.E.T. is a great character. Peaceful and curious, he just wants to go home. Also he has the awesome ability of telekenisis and can heal things with his fingers. One of the greatest non human characters in film history.The children actors in this film are legendary. Drew Barrymore is great as Gertie. Henry Thomas puts forth a legendary performance as Elliot, true that it no doubt will be his most memorable role and one that always will be associated with him. Also the actor who played Elliots brother was good as well.The music, is legendary. John Williams does a phenomenal job putting together a score that perfectly fits the film at the important points.One of the greatest films of all time. Highly recommended, thank you Steven Spielberg for making it.",10,0,1,25 May 2010
Alien: Resurrection," I Did Not Get It.
","I loved the film Alien and Aliens. I thought the film Alien 3 was pretty stupid, maybe not a terrible film, but I hated what happened in the film. Alien Resurrection was nothing special to me and it really did not stand out at all.Basically Ripley gets brought back by some scientific process so that they can remove the Queen Alien from her. The people that remove it then plan to use it to produce more aliens that they can use for research with the military. Ripley then has to help a group escape the complex they are on before it is destroyed and also stop the Aliens from getting to Earth.The story was all over. It seemed simple enough at the beginning, but then it got really complex and scientific. Also it had lots of holes in it. If they used a sample of Ripleys blood to bring her back, why would that contain the Queen Alien that was in her? I know breaking down science fiction films is not a good idea, but come on.The aliens are cool as always, but I think they looked better in other films when they were not just CGI. These CGI aliens just look fake to me, and I strongly prefer the aliens from the other films that were guys in costumes. Those looked way more real. Also, in this film why do the aliens roar like lions? They always made that screeching noise in past films, but not this time.The aliens do get in a lot of violence that is pretty cool, probably the most redeeming factor from the film.Ripley is different in this film, not bad just different. Sigourney Weaver does a decent job with the new form of Ripley, part human and deep down part alien. Very layed back and quiet and just odd in a way. More so the directors idea than Weavers I am sure, but I am not entirely sure what to make of Ripley in this film.The other human characters are just bland and not interesting at all. I did not feel like I could get behind any of them. Pretty much the opposite of the film Aliens where there was a great cast of humans that you could root for and felt you understood. Winona Ryder was OK, but probably over rating her because I think she is hot.The idea of having a human and alien hybrid is an interesting idea, albeit a disturbing result.THis is not a great film. It is not original, exciting, or for the most part memorable. I do not recommend this film, but it is not terrible. Just did not do it for me.",4,0,1,16 January 2010
Rocky V," Terrible movie from a great series.
","Rocky Five is terrible beyond belief. You may think that I am being hard on it but no. It is quite possibly the worst movie ever made and is an embarrassment to be in with the rest of the series, all of which were great movies. But this one, no.After having defeated Drago, Rocky starts experiencing physical problems, mainly shaking beyond belief. After returning home he meets up with his son who seems to have grown by more than five years of age since the last time they saw him. Rocky holds a press conference to announce his retirement but is quickly offered an opportunity to box against a young boxer named Union Caine by a man named George Washington. Rocky says no and returns home. This is where things start to go crazy.Soon it is found out that Paulie gave some guy a blank check signed by Rocky or something and that they lost all their money. So they are forced to move back to Philadelphia. Further issues show up when it is revealed that Rocky has suffered head trauma and further boxing can seriously injure him (watching this movie could also give you head trauma).However Rocky re opens the old boxing gym since Mickey willed it over to Rocky Jr. Now living in the old neighborhood Rocky Jr. begins school and is immediately beaten up by bullies. Rocky meanwhile meets up with a young boxer named Tommy Gunn whom wants Rocky to manage him but Rocky decides he is not a good enough listener. He latter changes his mind and agrees to train Tommy Gunn and begins to spend more time with Tommy than his own son and dissension soon forms between father and son.TOmmy Gunn moves up the ranks. George Washington meanwhile tries to lure Gunn away from Rocky by lavishing wealth and women upon him. Rocky Jr. beats up the bullies that bugged him. Gunn leaves Rocky and immediately battles Union Caine for the heavyweight champion title and wins it. Rocky and Jr. talk and patch things up. After winning the title Gunn is hassled by reporters who argue that him winning the belt is meaningless since he never beat Rocky to obtain it and because Caine was a paper champion.Gunn finds Rocky at a local Bar and challenges him but Rocky says no. Paulie then taunts Gunn but gets beaten up. Rocky then agrees to fight Gunn in the streets. Getting some support from the Spirit of Mickey, Rocky beats Gunn up.The whole concept of Rocky losing everything he got and starting off again where he started from is pretty stupid. Also the way he lost all of his money is really ignorant. And since Paulie is supposedly the reason for them losing so much they STILL LET HIM LIVE WITH THEM!!!! Tommy Gunn is a pretty lame character. ALso a Rocky Movie with no big fight in the ring at the end is a bad idea. Rocky fighting Gunn in the ring at the end would have made this movie a little better, not much, but I guess that idea was not good.If you are a fan of the Rocky movies stay away from this one. I got the box set of Rocky from my sister for Christmas one year but I never watch this one. FOr me Rocky five never happened.",2,4,8,26 August 2008
Hostel," A Little Too Disturbing For Me.
","Hostel is a basic Horror Gore film. I really am not a fan of films like this and after seeing this film I still am not a fan of films like this.Basically the story involves three guys who back pack across Europe. Soon they are each taken to a dungeon where they are tortured to death by people who pay to torture people to death.The idea is pretty scary. I mean people who pay to torture people to death is disturbing. I have heard that stuff like this really goes on but I do not even want to think about that. If this film intended on disturbing people by making them think that it could really happen then it worked on me.The gore is bad at parts and not bad at others. For example they do not really show people as they get tortured, they just show what they look like after they have been tortured. However seeing what they look like basically gets the job done as you do not really have to see the process they go through to see the end result. The weak stomached should stay away from this one. THere is one really really really bad part involving a blow torch and an Asian girl. I'll leave it at that.Basically another problem this film had was transitions. They would go from guys getting high to guys finding out about a place where they could get laid to guys getting hit on by older guys. It just was poorly transitioned. At one part they showed a girl about to have her toe cut off and as it was about to be cut off they cut to a scene of a girl cutting her toe nails. The flow is pretty bad as well. The acting was actually well done though, but sometimes a good script is just as important as good acting.I know that there are people out there who like films like this but I really did not like this film. Bad transitions, disturbing plot, and a little too much gore for me. I do not really recommend it unless you are a fan of horror films.",4,0,2,30 January 2009
Spider-Man 2," Major Flaws in 'Super Hero' Film.
","I really enjoyed the first Spiderman Film. I thought it did a good job establishing Spiderman and had a lot of action. Also it layed a good foundation for future sequels. I thought the second would be an action packed follow up that further developed characters. I was half right.Basically in this film Peter Parker is learning to live his life as both himself and Spiderman. THis leads to him constantly being late which affects his schoolwork, jobs, and most importantly his relationship with MJ. Meanwhile a doctor named Doc Ock is performing a fusion experiment but it goes horribly wrong and he has four metal arms that are really powerful fused to his body and he becomes Doctor Octopus. Parker soon decides that it may be best for him to hang up his Spiderman Costume and live as Peter Parker and not Spiderman. But will his decision be final? Too much of this film drags. For one the first half of the film Peter is still affected by his uncle Ben's death. That was a problem that should have been done after the last film. But through the film the characters are still coping with Bens death and it just would have been nice if that was not still an issue.Also this film deals more with Peter Parker than Spiderman. It should have been called Peter Parker. It is all about his relationship with MJ, his aunt May, and his best friend. The main conflict of the film is not dealing with Spiderman himself then.I thought the villain in this film, Doctor Octopus, was OK. However he does not get to fight with Spiderman enough. In fact after his first encounter with Spiderman you do not see him for a while and I think that all of the conflict concerning Peter Parker takes away from time that should have been with Doctor Octopus and Spiderman fighting.Spiderman could have been in the film more also. The core of the film barely shows Spiderman. I was hoping since they already established Spiderman in the first film that in this one he would get to do a lot more action and fighting but there really is a shortage of great action. SOme of it is good like how Spiderman battles Doctor Octopus on the side of the building, but there is not enough of it.Also what is the deal with Spiderman wanting to take off his mask in this film? That just seemed out of place.The conflict within characters is somewhat interesting though. It does not necessarily make this a bad film, just a boring at times Super Hero film. I came to see this film to see Spiderman get in a lot of action, not see Peter Parker try to work out his life.So this sequel does not have enough action for me. It has an OK villain, but there are a lot of major flaws in this super hero film. I do not recommend it greatly, the first Spiderman Film I think is much better but this is not that bad either. Worth seeing once or twice.",5,3,6,5 April 2009
Superbad," Does Not Exactly Live Up To Its Title.
","Supebad is another in a long list of teen comedy films. It does stand out in some ways, but a few holes in the film hold it back from being a good film instead of merely average.Basic Story involves two guys named Seth and Evan. They have another friend named Fogull who has a fake ID which they plan to use to buy alcohol to take to a party where they hope to have sex before they go to college.The two main characters are good. Seth is your basic loud fat guy who gets worked up pretty easy. PRetty funny character actually. Evan is your typical more easy going goody goody skinny guy who thinks things out more.Now for Fogull. I really could not stand this character. He is a total nerd who when he speaks he makes me want to punch him. Totally obnoxious character and I really truly hate this character and whenever he is on screen.There are some major flaws with this film. For one, these two police men pick up Fogull and then take him around to different bars which does not add anything to the plot in my opinion. Basically they just want to give reasons for Fogull and them to be on screen. These two police officers are not funny at all and they really drag out a lot of lame jokes.Also the ending to this film does not bring everything together. If anything it leaves the door open for a sequel which would not really surprise me if it would be made. However watching this film for me at the end of it did not feel like a complete ending.I must say the highlight of the film as far as being the most funny is when Seth reveals his childhood problem of how he would draw a part of the male anatomy in different styles of pictures. Pretty creative.SO there are some funny parts but a lot of lame and annoying characters which detract from the film. Also the ending is bad. I do not really recommend this film strongly but you may find it funny, I just found only certain parts funny.",5,1,3,26 January 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Eviscerating.
","I just saw 'Wolverine' in theatres. For the most part I thought it was exciting, action packed, and a great comic book movie for the most part. I was not the biggest fan of the X Men films, but I loved this film.Basically the film is about Wolverine(go figure). It shows how he gave up a life of violence to try to live a normal life, only to have to go back to what he wanted to get away from.A lot of credit should be given to Hugh Jackman. He really does an outstanding job as Wolverine in this film. You do not see many performances better than his in a comic book style film.The story is pretty good in this film. There are some flaws though. I think they may have jumped to Wolverine as an adult too quickly, they really did not even scratch the surface of what his childhood was about. But I think that helps the film to get going fast, basically most of the back story is shown in the opening credits. It jumps to the main story right away. I do not think that choosing to not show much of his childhood is necessarily a bad thing, like I said, it helps the film to get going.The action is legendary in this film. Wolverine gets in a lot of action as do many of the other characters. It is a spectacle to behold and some of the better action scenes in a film in a while. Better than anything that was in the other X Men films.I also liked the villains. Sabertooth was great, great background and motives as well as just being a scary guy. I was looking forward to seeing Deadpool and I thought he was portrayed in a unique and interesting way. Also agent Striker was great as the backstabbing U.S. Agent type.Gambit I was looking forward to as well. He was OK, but it seemed that he was there to serve only one purpose and did not do enough. Also I do not understand why Cyclops was in the film.So I liked this film, this is the new best Marvel film in my opinion. I hope that there are more great Origin Films to come. This is a film that I highly recommend.",9,17,42,1 May 2009
Terminator Salvation," Terminate This Film.
","Going into viewing Terminator Salvation, I really had high expectations and possibly too high of expectations. I could see this film being mediocre, but there was no reason for it to be as bad as it was.The plot is very bad in this film. For the most part I was unclear at the beginning what was going to be going on. I thought it was just going to be John Connor leading humanity against the machines. That was happening I guess, but there were a few side stories going on that I think deterred the film off the main purpose.I had no idea what was going on for the early part of this film. The reason that Kyle Reese was in the film is somewhat odd and very unclear. I do not want to keep beating a dead horse, the plot was very stupid and boring.Let me discuss the acting. Christian Bale was OK as John Connor. He did not do anything special. He uttered one extremely bad line that should never be said by anyone who is not named Arnold Schwarzenneggar. If you saw the film you know what I mean.The action was OK at times. The effects were well done, especially for the T 800s. But a lot of the times the action scenes were too fastly paced and it was hard to tell what was going on.Also, there was not a lot of humor in this film. It was too serious. The other Terminator FIlms were not comedy flicks, but they at least had fun moments at times. This one did not have any funny parts really.Towards the end of this film they show the T 800 covered in skin looking like Schwarzenneggar. THat made me remember how great he was in the other films and how great he made those films. Schwarzenneggar was far more important to this series than people realize and his absence from this film for me made me see that without Schwarrzenneggar the Terminator Franchise would not be as great.So, OK action, bad plot, no Schwarzenneggar. Not recommended at all and a huge disappointment for me.",3,15,55,21 May 2009
X-Men," Not Enough Character Development.
","I saw X Men for the first time yesterday. I thought it was OK but it could have been much better. For one thing the only character who really is developed and explained how he came to be is Wolverine for the most part. The other mutants (Cyclops, Jean Grey, Storm) really get no explanation at all as to why they are mutants. THis film was not very long either so they could have taken a minute or two to explain how each mutant got their powers. Did they just expect everyone to know each of their back stories? I knew a little about X Men before seeing this film because I have read some of the comics and also watched the show back in the day but what if someone who had no prior knowledge watched the film? They would be lost a little. ALso there are not nearly enough action scenes. The fight at the end is quick and not spectacular. ALso Wolverine is on screen way more than any of the other X Men, this really is a wolverine film. The scenes with him are nice but they could have shown some other X Men as well, like Cyclops. Cyclops does not have enough dialogue. But I liked the scenes with Wolverine, those were well done. But this is not a film about Just wolverine, it is titled X men and they do not show enough about each X Men. Maybe they will in the sequel which I will see soon. But for the most part this film is too short and should have made more scenes to describe each X Men members back story and the action scenes are OK but there are not enough of them. Not strongly recommended but it is OK. Five out of ten.",5,1,2,25 February 2009
Spider-Man 3," Expected More.
","I really liked the first Spiderman Film, and thought the second one was lacking. If anything I was hoping that the third Spiderman Film would be like the first and not the second and be a great film. I was disappointed big time.A lot is going on in terms of the plot. Harry flies around on a flying disc as the New Goblin and gets his short term memory messed up after Peter Parker throws him into the ground. Parker then decides he wants to propose to Mary Jane. Meanwhile, a runaway jail escapee gets mixed up with sand molecules and becomes the Sand Man. An evil symbiote from Outer Space merges with Parkers Spiderman suit and creates an eviler symbiote version of Spiderman that is all black. Also, Mary Jane has issues with Parker, the true identity of Ben Parkers killer is discovered, and Parker gets sharp competition for his photography job.First of all, I think the plot and story was bad. It had good parts to it, I think it is interesting how the Symbioate merged with Spiderman. ALso I liked how Parker decided to try to propose to Mary Jane. But there seemed to be too much going on. There were too many side stories and lame parts in the film that seemed to not need to be included.In the second SPiderman film I complained that Parker was not Spiderman enough in the film. In this film I think that is an issue once again. Spiderman is not seen enough. It is all about Peter Parker once again, that was OK I guess for one film but it really disappointed me how in this film Spiderman does not show up enough again.The Villains I think were too underdeveloped in this film. The Sandman gets an OK explanation, but not good enough. The Sandman was an interesting choice but I did not think that he had a good portrayal. You hear about his family and his motives resulting because of his family but it just seemed like something was lacking. Also I think that there were too many villains and with no development that is a major issue for me.Venom also appears in this film. I like Venom a lot and he really is one of the greatest villains ever in Marvel History. Actually I think he is the best. But he should not have been second fiddle to any villain let alone THE SANDMAN as he is in this film. Venom should have been a major villain and in this film he is not in it enough. I liked what he looked like, but the guy playing him did a bad job I think also.I did like how the Symbiote infected Spiderman and made him do bad things. But they should have built on that idea more.THe action was OK at times also. Like when Spiderman was fighting the Sandman the first time it was pretty cool. Also I thought the fight with Venom looked cool at times. But nothing too spectacular.So, I think this was a disappointment for the most part. It was OK at times, but should have been so much better. All I can say to finish, is that I hope that Venom gets to be in another film so that he gets the film depiction that he really deserves. I really do not strongly recommend this film, but it is not that bad either. Worth seeing once.",5,1,2,8 April 2009
The Terminator," 'I'll Be Back.'
","The Terminator is the first and best film of the Terminator Films and easily one of the best action films I have seen. Schwarzenneggar makes this film and this is his best performance in a film in my opinion.The Terminator machine is sent back to the year 1984. His purpose, to kill Sarah Conner and prevent her from giving birth to her son who will go on to lead humans to victory over the machines. Kyle Reese, a human, also gets sent back to the same year in order to protect Sarah from The Terminator.The Terminator is one of the greatest villains ever. Relentless, he only has one purpose in this film, to kill Sarah Conner. He has no emotion or care for anything or anyone. Completely cold and evil machine. Schwarrzenneggar does such a great job of portraying him, he really moves and acts like a cybornetic machine would. Awesome villain and portrayal in this film. I like Arnold better in this villain role than in the hero role he plays in the sequels to The Terminator.Also I liked the acting and characters of Kyle Reese and Sarah Conner. Reese is a great character to play the military guy intent on protecting Conner. Linda Hamilton does great as Sara Conner and really does a good job playing the women who goes from being scared and weak to being a strong woman who is able to protect herself.The setting is great. I really like how most of the film takes place during the night, giving it a dark feel. ALso love how whenever The Terminator is on screen there is the sound of a deep drum beating continuously. That just adds to the setting and also makes The Terminator to seem like an evil thing.THe action is great. Car chases, attacks in clubs and police stations, and a chase through a factory at night. It just is great action.To conclude, I think this is easily the best of the Terminator Franchise. Great villain, tone and setting, and acting. Recommended to the highest.",10,1,2,7 April 2009
Cloverfield," Dizzy and Confusing.
","I saw Cloverfield in my film class. I can truly say that this is a movie that I took no enjoyment in seeing. I guess it is a unique idea to have the entire film be filmed from the point of view of someone with a video camera but for me it just got dizzy and bad. I did not like that concept at all, other people may but I hated that point of view and really it made it hard to tell what was going on. The monster in the film was OK, but nothing special. The characters in the film were boring and not interesting. I understand that they all were having a party or something, but the story just seemed rushed or something. BUt overall one of the worst films that I have ever seen. I do not recommend this film.",1,5,10,7 July 2009
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Great Conclusion to the Original Trilogy.
","Return of the Jedi is a great conclusion to the original Star Wars Trilogy. It ties up all the loose ends and also has a lot of memorable outstanding moments.Luke and Leia travel to Tatooine to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, where he is still trapped in carbonite. The Emperor meanwhile is overseeing the construction of a larger and more powerful Death Star. Also he is planning on assisting Darth Vader in turning Luke over to the dark side of the force.The characters are great once again. Luke is great as a true Jedi Knight and really has matured greatly over the films. Leia continues to be a strong female character which pleases feminists all over the world. Solo comes full circle and truly is helping the rebel alliance as well as others and learns to care for others instead of just for himself. Vader also gets to develop more of a good side as he talks with Luke.Once again there are a lot of great new characters as well. Jabba the Hutt appears for the first time. Huge, disgusting, and vile, he really is one of the most memorable characters from Star Wars. Overall I think Jabba may be the most disgusting character from a film and makes for a unique style of villain.The Emperor makes his first physical appearance in a film in this film. (Empire Strikes Back he is in but just as a hologram so this is his first real appearance.) As a bad guy he is legendary. Completely obsessed with the dark side of the force, there is nothing good about him. You do not get characters more evil than this.There are a lot of great scenes in this film. Like the entire sarlacc pit scene, Luke's battle with the Rancor, the speeder bike scene, and tons of other scenes. The effects in this film are great for the time it was made.One complaint though. THe Ewoks show up for the first time. While I think that the one Ewok, Wicket, is cool, I really can not stand the rest of the clan. THey are just little furry bears that I think do not fit in the film. The entire idea of them being able to hold their own against the Empire's troops may seem like a good message of determination and courage, but I think it is a joke. I could have gone without the Ewoks, they make it seem too childish.I do not want to say too much about this film, it is great though. Not as good as The Empire Strikes Back in my opinion but easily the second best from the original trilogy and one that I highly recommend.",9,1,2,22 April 2009
Alien," In Space No One Can Hear You Scream.
","Alien is the first film in the Alien film franchise. It is a very good film that combines aspects of the science fiction film with the Horror Film. The result is a pretty scary film that also has some interesting science fiction in it as well.The story is pretty easy to follow for the most part in this film. A giant space ship with a group of seven people receives an SOS signal from a planet so it lands. On the planet one member of the group gets an alien embryo implanted in him that later turns into an alien that starts to cause problems for the members on the ship.The Alien in this film is a classic. The way it looks with its long head, evil looking mouth with a tongue that can shoot out like a chameleons and also has a separate set of teeth at the end of its tongue is classic. This is the best Alien species in any film in my opinion. The alien gets to do a lot of evil and awesome things in this film. However you do not really get a good view of him. But this works in this film. If you see too much of him then it will not be as scary when it pops out and attacks, which it does a lot in this film. Also he pops out a lot in places where there are distractions that do not allow for a good view of him. This aspect of how the alien is presented makes for a very successful and scary technique that will frighten most audiences. That is why this film is the most scary of all the alien films. In other alien films you know that there are a lot of aliens that are going to come out. In this film there is only one and you never know when he will appear.Sigourney Weaver is awesome in this film. She really is a great actress and this is the film that propelled her to greatness. SHe always plays a convincing role and this is easily one of her best films. The rest of the cast is OK.The setting is great. It takes place mainly on the huge freighter ship that has a lot of places where the alien can hide in. This setting also helps to make the film scary. Being on a huge ship that has an evil alien on it in the middle of space is very scary. In space no one can hear you scream either.This is a great science fiction/horror film that combines elements from each film type to make a great horror film that contains science fiction elements. Recommended strongly.",9,0,1,27 February 2009
Rocky II," Outstanding Sequel.
","'Rocky' is truly one of the greatest films ever made. So a sequel to this film would have a tough time following it. Rocky 2 does a great job following up 'Rocky' and is truly a great film.The story starts up right where 'Rocky' left off. Rocky goes to the hospital and has surgery and it is revealed that further fighting could damage his eye badly and make him go blind possibly. So Rocky settles down, marries Adrian and starts making commercials. Soon Adrian gets pregnant. However soon his ability to not read well costs him his job making commercials and Rocky struggles to find another job. Elsewhere Apollo Creed is furious that so many people are criticizing him for going 15 rounds with a guy who came off that street. So Apollo wants a rematch. Rocky decides that he must fight again, which upsets Adrian due to the health risks he may face.This film succeeds mainly due to the fact that it does a great job continuing the Rocky saga. It starts right up after 'Rocky' and further continues the story. It is an awesome follow up. All of the characters are further developed. Apollo Creed is shown more and his character is expanded the most and you get to see what he is like more. Carl Weathers does a great job with Creed in this episode and really plays the upset athlete at the media well. Paulie takes a back seat in this film for the most part but Adrian is very significant in this film as she is the main reason why Rocky is so reluctant to get back in the ring.Rocky 2 is really funny, more so than the first one. Love how Rocky goes around trying to get a job despite the fact that he has basically no education. Also humorous is how bad Rocky is at reading cue cards and what he chooses to talk about at his press conference with Apollo. For the most part Rocky and Rocky 2 are more funny than the next films mainly because of how Rocky becomes 'civilized' in 'Rocky 3' and loses his sense of humor in some ways.The training that ROcky does in this film is epic. Love the training that he goes through in this film, slamming metal, chasing chickens, and hopping around with lumber on his shoulders. Rocky really works hard training in this film, my personal favorite of his films in how he trains.No film is perfect though. The 'Gonna FLy Now' song is not the same as it is in the first film. It is not sung by the same people who sang it is the first film so it is not nearly as good. However this song is only used when Rocky is running, not when he is doing his other training. They use the 'Going the Distance' song when he is doing his training outside of his running which is fine.Also the fight at the end of the film is not nearly as good as the fight in the first film. It is mainly just Rocky getting pounded relentlessly and having to overcome a superior athlete. Not like in the first film where it is an even fight for the most part.A great sequel that is funny, further expands the story and characters, and has some really great and memorable moments. A must see and easily the second best film of the series.",9,26,28,16 January 2009
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Jango Fett.
","Attack of the Clones is one of the better films I have seen in the last ten years. It is much better than the Phantom Menace and a great second film for the New Star Wars saga.Assassination attempts are made on Queen Amidala. Anakin Skywalker is sent to protect her and act as her personal bodyguard, and he soon finds himself falling in love with her. After examining a dart from an assassination attempt on Amidala, Obi Wan Kenobi is led to the planet Kamino where they reveal that they have been preparing a clone army for the republic.The plot is much better in this film. They do away with a lot of politics and instead deal with the clone army and assassination attempts on Queen Amidala. Much easier to understand what is going on.Characters are great as always. Obi Wan gets to do a lot in this film and really gets to show why he is such a great jedi. Yoda also gets to display his own awesomeness in a great lightsaber duel. Also Mace Windu gets to show why many refer to him as the most powerful jedi by using his special purple lightsaber for the first time in this film. Queen Amidala is super hot in this film and well played once again by Natalie P ortman.Anakin Skywalker is played by Hayden Christensian in this film. Much better portrayal of Anakin in this film as opposed to the first film. While Hayden is not perfect, he does an above average job of playing Anakin and is great at looking angry at several different parts as well as showing how Anakin has issues with being arrogant. The love scenes with Amidala were nothing special and sometimes odd. But overall I would give Hayden a B+ as Anakin Skywalker in this film.The battle scene at the end is much better in this film. You get to see the jedi in an epic battle against the Confederate Droid army. This is a million times better than the Gungan against Droid army battle from The Phantom Menace.The villains I really liked in this film. Count Dooku is much different than Darth Maul as a sith. Rather than just an excellent fighter, Dooku is a well spoken villain. He converses well with people, even his enemies and is really a great tactician and recruiter of different systems to his cause. Also not bad with the lightsaber as well.However the best part of this film is the fact that Jango Fett is in it. I love Boba Fett so I was excited beyond belief that Jango Fett, Boba's father, was going to be in this film. Every bit as awesome as Boba is Jango who is as skilled as a warrior as he is as a bounty hunter. The fight between Jango and Obi Wan is awesome in this film and probably my favorite part of the film. Jango being in this film was awesome and easily the x factor of the film that puts it over the top.So great action, story, and Jango Fett. Highly recommended.",10,1,4,17 April 2009
Captain America: The First Avenger," The Star Spangled Man With the Plan
","I am a huge fan of the Marvel Universe. So when I saw the trailer for this film I was super excited and was hopeful that it would be a great movie. I was not disappointed.Steve Rogers is a brave little guy who cannot get into the army because of his health and such. However a doctor sees his courage and good man qualities and suggests him for the Super Soldier Program which will make his physical abilities match his personality. So he becomes Captain America. Captain America then helps the army in a battle against Hydra and the evil Red Skull.I think this film had a great story. It was not too complicated to follow it. The overall feel of it being set during World War 2 was awesome.Casting was very good as has been the case lately for Marvel Films. I liked Chris Evans in Fantastic Four and had doubts for him in this film but I think he did a really good job. Captain America in this film is a hero that you root for and get to see grow over the film. Tommy Lee Jones was great as always as the general in the army.A major strength this film had was the villain Red Skull. Played by Hugo Heaving I found him to be perfect as Red Skull. Menacing and evil he was an outstanding villain.There is a lot going on in this film as well. Not to much down time and a lot of good action. It starts a little slow with Rogers before he is Captain America but after that it really gets good.Overall, I found this film to be great. Highly recommend it.",Null,1,3,8 November 2011
Predator," Great Action Film.
","Predator is a great action film that combines military action with outer space creatures. A group of top notch military soldiers soon find that they are being hunted by a mysterious being. First off I want to say that the cast is really good in this film. Schwarzenneggar gives one of his best performances in a film and definitely one of his most under rated. He has a lot of great one liners ('stick around', 'knock knock') as well. Carl Weathers also is great in this film and I think he is one of the best supporting actors in the films that he is in notably 'Rocky' and 'Happy Gilmore'. ALso you can not go wrong with Jessie Ventura in an action film. The Predator in this film is pretty cool. I like how they do not give away what he looks like right away to build suspense. The idea of a creature that blends in to the surroundings and kills is pretty cool. The Predator gets to do a lot of killing in this film and is a pretty good bad guy for a film.THere is no shortage of action in this film. Right off the bat there is a great gun fire battle between Schwarrzenneggars crew and some foreign country, I forget who they are. Then you have the Predator going against the entire group and an epic battle between Schwarzenneggar and the Predator one on one. Of all the Predator films this is the best by far and I strongly recommend it.",9,5,6,5 February 2009
Cast Away," All You Need is Hanks.
","I once stated that due to Tom Hanks being such a great actor that a film could be made with him being the only character and it would still be great. This film prooves that theory.Hanks stars as a fedex worker named Chuck. He gets stranded on an island and must survive there, the only possessions he has with him are a few fed ex boxes.This is a great survival film. Stranded on an island with no help makes for a great conflict that someone can relate to as it could happen to anybody.Tom Hanks is phenomenal in this film. He really plays a man stranded on an island well. Shows all of the emotions needed; fear, panic, excitement, anger, and determination. I never thought that anyone could make a volleyball seem like a person but this film did that thanks to Hanks great acting. THis really could be his best performance, but he has so many and I think it is safe to say that he is one of the greatest actors who ever lived.Zemeckis deserves a lot of credit too. THis film obviously had great directing and Zemeckis is a really under rated director in my opinion. Everything seemed perfectly right in this film.Great conflict and legendary acting. Highly recommended and easily one of Tom Hanks's best films and that says a lot.",10,3,4,30 April 2009
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Gets Better Each Time I See It
","Terminator 2 is one of the best sequels ever made and a great action and science fiction movie. It further develops characters and has a great story as well. Each time I see it I like it a little more.Two Terminators are sent back to 1991. One is given the mission to kill John Conner, and the other one has the mission of protecting John Conner. Sarah Conner is currently in a mental institution for trying to destroy the computer that eventually would attack mankind on Judgement Day.The story is a great follow up to the first Terminator film. This time it feels like a lot more is going on. Its fitting how the Terminator did not kill Sarah Conner in the first film so it was sent back this time to kill John Conner as a young man. I like the parts that work from events that happened in the first movie, like how the Terminators hand is in the headquarters of Cyberdyne Industries and how they remember the first Terminators attack on the police station.The action scenes do a good job of complimenting the story. I really like the action scenes in this movie, especially when the T-101 fights the T-1000.Arnold is great as the Terminator again, this time as a heroic defender. I also really liked him as a bad guy in the first movie, but he is just as good as a good guy. He always is great in these films, which are definitely his best films he has made.The T-1000, played by Robert Patrick, is also great as the villain. He is really cool as a liquid metal machine that can make sharp pointed weapons. The special effects for him are really well done and hold up really well. Probably this film and Jurassic Park have the best usage of special effects in a film. I like how the T-1000 is a villain, but also cyberdyne industries and skynet are also a villain too.John Conner is pretty cool for a kid character, and you can see why people will follow him in the future. Sarah Conner is a much more interesting character in this film and gets to do a lot more.Great story, great characters, and great action. Great movie. I recommend it greatly.",10,1,3,11 April 2014
Rocky IV," Odd At Parts, Great At Others.
","Let me start off by saying that I am amazed at how many people do not think this film is great. Hopefully reading this review will help you to see the film the way that I do, AS ONE OF THE GREATEST FILMS EVER MADE!!!!! Russia decides to enter the boxing world. Ivan Drago, an enormous giant guy with super human strength not unlike He Man(the actor who played Drago also played He Man in 'Masters of the Universe'), is the guy the Russians hype up. Punching at extremely high power 'Whatever he hits he destroys'. Apollo gets upset at how the Russians think that they can box so he decides to go against Drago in an exhibition match. Rocky and Adrian both tell Apollo how he should think this decision out more but Apollo decides that he must do this. When Apollo and Drago fight it is a complete disaster and Drago kills Apollo, and I do not mean that Drago beats him bad I mean that he really KILLS HIM! Rocky decides to train over in Russia and then to go against Drago in the ring.One of the main reasons that a movie is great is because of a great villain. Drago is truly a great villain. A boxer that kills somebody in the ring is really scary if you ask me. So the fact that Rocky is going against a guy who can kill you in the ring basically adds a lot more intrigue to this match up than some in the past. Drago is easily the best bad guy in the Rocky Series and one of the best bad guys ever if you ask me.Rocky is a great character in this film. He is not as celebrity like as he was in Rocky 3, but he is not as street like as he was in the first two films. Basically his character in this film is a mature heavy weight champion getting near the end who knows how to handle things. Rocky does some of his best training ever in this film climbing mountains, chopping wood, lifting horse trailers, and doing excruciating looking sit ups. Rocky does not mess around training either and has no lapses like he did in previous films.Apollo dying I think adds a lot to the story in this film. Rocky is fighting against Drago not for money, not for the heavy weight title, but to get revenge for his deceased friend and I think that is a lot more important than money or a title.The music selection is awesome. 'Hearts on Fire', 'Burning Heart', and 'THeres No Easy Way Out' are all played at great times and add to the film greatly. Vince Dicola was the composer of this film and this is the only Rocky film he is the composer for but his background music goes great with this film. Dicola also did the 'Transformers Animated Movie' soundtrack and several of the songs sound similar. 'Gonna Fly Now' is not used at all in this film but to tell you the truth the music was so good in this film that I did not care nor notice.The final fight between Rocky and Drago is great. Not much more to add on that, you just need to see it.There are a few issues I have with this film. Number one, what is the deal with the Robot that Rocky buys Paulie for his birthday? IT just seems out of place and really adds nothing to the film at all. Maybe they just wanted to add some science fiction but the Robot part at the beginning is just odd.The ending is odd too. Rocky is going against Russia's number one boxer and at the beginning Rocky is booed mercilessly. Then towards the end of the fight the crowd starts cheering for ROcky????? That would never happen and given the circumstances I think this may be the most far fetched event in movie history.Great Villain, great music, great plot, and overall just Great Rocky. Probably the third best of the series but still one of the greatest sporting movies ever. Highly recommended.",9,2,3,21 January 2009
Spider-Man," Best Marvel Film I Have Seen So Far.
","Spiderman is the best Marvel Film that I have seen in my life. It does a good job showing how Peter Parker becomes Spiderman and lays a good foundation for the series.Peter Parker is a smart student who is often picked on by other kids at school. However, after he gets bitten by a radioactive spider he becomes Spiderman his life changes. Soon Parker learns that with great power comes great responsibility.I think this film has a great flow to it. Not even ten minutes in Parker gets bitten by the spider that turns him into spiderman. That is good because then the rest of the film consists of Parker learning how to use his powers and get in a lot of great action.The action is great in this film. They really did a good job of using CGI in this film. At times you can tell that spiderman is not real and is computer animated, but for the most part everything looks good.I think Tobey Mcguire does a pretty good job as Spiderman. In the comics Spiderman is really funny, full of a lot of great jokes. However for the most part SPiderman is not that witty in this film and I think that a lot has to do with Mcguire not being a really funny actor. Good actor, but not humorous really. I do think that Mcguire makes a better Peter Parker than he does Spiderman. Overall I would give him a seven out of ten as spiderman.I think that the main villain in this film, the Green Goblin, was actually really good. I wondered who they would use as Spidermans first film villain and I think they made a good choice. Goblin gets to do a lot of fighting with Spiderman and also has a good back story, so he is a deep villain.A few complaints. I did not like how they had Spiderman get the ability to shoot webs from his body. I think it is better how in the comics he made his own web shooters. Just my opinion though. The comics of Spiderman are better than the film but that is the case for most super hero films I think.So this is the best Marvel Film that I have seen. Great action, good flow, and also a good villain. Highly recommended.",9,0,1,4 April 2009
Aliens," Queen of the Aliens.
","Aliens is a very good follow up film to Alien. It is a great science fiction film that also has a lot of action in it.Ripley wakes up 57 years after she went to sleep after getting rid of the alien. She is asked to help provide information regarding the aliens to help a military group that is going after a swarm of the aliens that wiped out a civilization. Reluctantly she agrees to help them. Once there the group encounters problems as the ship that they take to land on the planet is destroyed.James Cameron took over as director of this film. He really did an outstanding job of making an action packed science fiction film that also has a lot of emotion. Great job.The main thing great about this film is the action. There is plenty of weopons going off, explosions constantly, and lots fighting. Indeed the first alien film was part horror and part science fiction, but this one is part action and part science fiction. The combination of those genres works in this film the same way that the other combination worked for the first alien film.The aliens are awesome in this film. Their look is revised a little to make them look more menacing and animal like. They also pop out of the most unsuspecting places. In the first Alien film there was only one alien in it, but this one has countless numbers of them. It almost seems that there is no end to them. Also this film introduces the Queen Alien whom is pretty terrifying. It also is important that she be introduced since she is the source for the alien eggs. A great villain creature that really is impressive.Sigourney Weaver is as good as ever. THe way that Ripley forms a bond with the young girl newt in this film shows just how good of an actress that Weaver is. One scene she is a strong female able to fend for herself, and the next she is a motherly figure who is very loving.Also I liked how Michael Biehn was in this film. I thought he was great in Terminator and he is better in this film in my opinion. The cast as a whole is great.An awesome sequel, just as good as the first if not better. It has great acting, action, and Aliens. Highly recommended.",9,1,2,6 April 2009
Batman Begins," Great New Beginning to Batman.
","Batman Begins marks the beginning of a new Batman Series. Using a different more serious approach it is a very good film that does a good job explaining how Batman came to be.The film starts off explaining how Bruce Wayne endured tragedy and endured through out his life. Wayne is in another country and learns a style of martial arts/ninja from a group. Returning back to Gotham City he takes back control of his families business and decides to do something about all of the crime and corruption in Gotham. Thus is the reason he becomes Batman.Overall I think this film does a good job of showing the intent of Bruce Wayne to become Batman. Crime helped end his parents's life and he wanted to get revenge. However at parts I think the film drags a little, especially prior to Wayne returning back to Gotham. Wayne could have become Batman earlier in the film in my opinion.The action is pretty good and I like the seriousness to this film. Some of the past Batman films were way too cheesy and lame but Batman Begins has a nice serious tone to it.Christian Bale does a good job portraying Batman. OVerall this film had some great actors in it, Liam Neesan, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and even Rutgeur Haeur is in it.I thought the Villains were pretty good. Scarecrow for me was the highlight of the film. I like how he is portrayed as a scientist who wants to control the mind by imposing fear into people by using a toxin that creates fear. Very terrifying indeed. Overall the whole using fear inducing gas against the city is a pretty evil plan that makes you want to see what happens next. Liam Neesan playing the other villain of the film, Rhas Al Guhl, really did not do much for me but I respect Neesan for his work as Qui Gon Jin in Star Wars so it was nice to see him in this film.Interesting I found it how they did not use the batmobile and instead used a vehicle called the tumbler which is like a tank. I kind of give the people who made this film respect for trying to put in new ideas for vehicles.So I like this film in that it has a serious tone, which fits Batman well, has a great villain in Scarecrow, and overall just did a lot of things that seemed to be missing from other Batman films. Definitely the best Batman film yet and one that I highly recommend.",8,0,1,13 January 2009
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Tyrannosaurus Was The Key.
","The Lost World is a sequel that is often said to be vastly inferior to Jurassic Park. While I agree that Jurassic Park is the better film, The Lost World is a very good film as well.Ian Malcolm and three others travel to Isla Sorna. While they are there to just observe the dinosaurs and how they have adapted. A group of hunters/entrepeaneurs travel to the island as well intent on capturing various dinosaurs and putting them into a zoo back in the United States.The story is pretty easy to follow. I like how they expanded the story from the first film and make references to 'Jurassic Park' as well.Acting was very good for the most part. Jeff Goldblum is awesome as always and though many people miss Grant in this film, I think that Malciolm is cool to see as the lead character. I did not really like Julianne Moore as the female lead in this film. NOt anywhere near as good as Laura Dern in 'Jurassic Park'.THe dinosaurs made this film. The velociraptors return and are as scary and terrifying as always. Computer graphics are used a lot for the dinosaurs in this film and for the most part it all looks pretty good and realistic.The Tyrannosaurus returns. For me the Tyrannosaurus made the film and is the main reason it is such a good film. Tyrannosaurus gets in a lot of action going after the hunting party, pushing trailers off cliffs, and going on a rampage through the city. I love how they pay respect to the original Lost World film by bringing the Tyrannosaurus back to the city the same way in the original Lost World they bring back a Brontosaurus. Tyrannosaurus going on a rampage through the city works so well and is the best part of the film. In fact the rampage Tyrannosaurus goes on is better than what the 1997 Godzilla did.The Tyrannosaurus is not just a rampaging monster in this film. Also it is portrayed as being a very loving and caring parent in how it takes care of its baby. Tyrannosaurus takes very good care of its baby in this film and I like how they added these parenting scenes.There also are a few new dinosaurs that appear in this film including Pachysaphalasaurus, Parasaurolophus, and Compsognathus. New dinosaurs are always good to see.I love this film. Jeff Goldblum is great, there is lots of action, but the Tyrannosaurus for me made the film. Highly recommended.",9,2,3,8 February 2009
X-Men: The Last Stand," Best of the Series.
","I thought the first X men film was OK and the second was slightly above average. X Men: The Last Stand I feel is the best of the series and is a pretty good film.Basically in this film a cure is discovered that can cure mutants. Magneto believes this to be the last straw for humans and decides to start a final war against all of them. More trouble occurs when Jean Grey returns in the evil form of the Phoenix and joins Magnetos side.Once again I feel that there is a lack of some character development. Magneto has a bunch of different mutants join his team. Almost all of them are not given much of a backstory, like Juggernaut for example. Angel is in it, but is given a brief explanation how he got his wings and he does not seem to have anything important to add. So it is nice to see him but I am not sure the purpose for him being there.Wolverine and Jean Grey are the most important in this film once again. It is pretty cool how Jean Grey becomes the Phoenix and is more powerful and evil in this form. It is always interesting how good guys become bad guys. I do not want to give too much away but Cyclops does not do much in this film again and I am sort of glad they added other characters to take screen time away from him.I like how they let Ice Man and Colossus do more in this film. Colossus is my favorite and he gets to do some fighting with the other X Men. Also he gets to execute the Fastball Special with Wolverine a few times. And of course he gets to turn into steel which looks awesome. For the most part the special effects in this film are awesome.Ice Man gets to develop more in this film. Also he gets in an awesome duel with Pyro towards the end of the film.The Beast is a new character added for this film. He is played by Kelsey Grammar, an interesting choice. But I think he was well portrayed and is a pretty good character that was added.This film has the most action of all the X men films. THe final twenty minutes or so are spectacular.A few more complaints. I really did not understand why they had to show a young Angel trying to cut off his wings and leaving a bloody mess. That was upsetting. Also I thought at times Rogue seemed lame especially in a scene where she says that Iceman is only after one thing. For the most part there is some confusion as to whether Iceman cheated on ROgue or if he wants to stay with her.Pretty good film. Has some flaws but also has the most action of any X Men film. Recommend this one more than the other two X Men films.",7,0,2,3 March 2009
Back to the Future Part III," Worst of the Trilogy.
","I think that the first two Back to the Future films were awesome. So I thought that when I saw the third installment that I would love that one as well. I was mistaken.Basically Marty has to get help from Doc Brown in 1955 to get back to 1985. After they uncover the time machine they discover that Doc was killed in 1885 by Maddog Tanner. So Marty decides to go back in time to rescue Doc instead. Along the way the delorian experiences problems and Doc Falls in love.I think this film does a good job of continuing the series. The beginning starts off right where Number two left off. When it gets to the Western Part is where the problems start.There is a lack of good jokes and action in this one. The other two were way more funny and had much better action.The whole western setting makes this film seem like a comedic western film rather than a back to the future film. It seems as if there was not as much going on and the main conflict of getting back to 1985 was not as pressing as the conflicts in the other films.Also I did not like the whole Doc falls in love part of this film. Maybe it is because the actress who plays his girlfriend, Mary Steenberg, added nothing to this film. Seems like she is just reading her lines rather than trying to act. Doc did not seem like the character that I knew from the first two films in this one.Michael J. Fox is great though. He always is great as Marty in these films and once again is in top acting form. His performance in this film makes the film worth watching.Definitely the worst of the series. Did not seem as exciting and funny too me and the whole love story made it lame. I recommend it the least of the series and at least this film puts an OK end to the series. Still it should have been better.",6,2,5,4 May 2009
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Power Cosmic?
","I am a fan of the Silver Surfer. I have worked hard to unlock him in Marvel Ultimate Alliance, own the NES game Silver Surfer, and also have read a lot of the comics. I went to see this film because of him, not because I liked the first Fantastic Four Film.I thought that the first Fantastic Four film was average at best. I did not like the actors cast as Mr. Fantastic and Mrs. Fantastic. I think Jessica Alba is very attractive but she can not effectively portray Mrs. Fantastic. Mr. Fantastic's portrayal in the film is bland and not exciting at all. He just adds nothing to the screen and is very uncharismatic.I do like the Human Torch and I think he is the best portrayed of the four. He acts the way he was in the comics and that is good. The Thing is pretty cool also and he is pretty well portrayed also, easily the second best in these films.So I was banking on Silver Surfer helping to raise the film to greatness. Silver Surfer was great, but a few issues. For one, when he does not have his board with him he is able to still use the power cosmic to bring it back to him. He did not need the board to use his power all the time. In this film once he loses his board he is defenseless. They should have stuck to the comics portrayal of him. Surfer gets to do a lot of damage but he really does not fight anyone outside of Galactus and Dr. Doom briefly.I have issues with Dr. Doom. WHy did they decide to put him in this film? The reasoning behind why he was put in the film is so stupid. They should have known not to release him from his prison and choosing to release him just to help out the Fantastic Four borders on retardation.If anything they should have left Dr. Doom out of the film and made Galactus the main bad guy. Galactus is not the way he should be. He is just a huge cloud and looks nothing like how he does in the comics. That was a huge disappointment since he is one of the best Marvel Villains.There also is a lack of solid action. That was also an issue with the first film. A super hero film with a lack of action is bad.Not a very outstanding film. Silver Surfer was cool, but the rest is not.",5,0,1,28 February 2009
Transformers," Great Foundation Set.
","Transformers was a very good film that I enjoyed enough to watch three times when it was in the theater. It is pretty entertaining and also sets a good foundation for future sequels to be made.Sam Whitwicky has a pair of his grandfathers glasses. On these glasses are coordinates to find the cube, the cube is a cube that is able to give life to machines and turns them into transformers. The autobots arrive on Earth and warn Sam and must have the glasses. Unfortunately the Decepticons also arrive on Earth.I think the effects were outstanding in this film. All of the Transformers in this film looked very real. I like how they gave them a new look, and did not just 100 percent give them the same look that they had in the cartoon. This shows that the director and effects people gave new interpretations to characters.The story was good, not great. But I think that at times it gets a little complicated, especially with the military. Not overly confusing, but a little. Also I think that the film tends to drag a lot, I understand the importance of build up, but it takes a while for all of the Transformers to appear.The human characters were OK. However I think there were way too many human characters that speak a lot in this film. I want to see lots of different Transformers, not humans.Now for the Transformers. I think they included most of the ones they needed to in a first film. Optimus Prime was great as were the rest of the autobots (Jazz, Bumblebee, Ratchet, and Ironhide). The Decepticons were awesome as well, however it was interesting how some of the decepticons were not similar to what they were in the television show. Like how Frenzy was a boom box and Bonecrusher was a minesweeper. The decepticons, other than Megatron, did not get to say much of anything nearly as much as the autobots.The action is OK. BUt when the Autobots were fighting the Decepticons it kind of gets hard to tell who is winning and who is losing. Basically the fight scenes are fast and the Transformers blend together and as a result you have no idea what is going on.Megan Fox was great, I love her assets. Not much more to say on that topic.So this film is very good. IF anything this film set the groundwork, so while it may lack in some areas you know that the next films should be great thanks to this film. I recommend this film and also can not wait for the sequel.",8,2,2,7 June 2009
The Dark Knight," This IS NOT the Greatest Film Ever.
","The Dark Knight was the most hyped movie that I have ever gone to see. While I thought it was good, it was nowhere near the hyped that it received and I doubt any movie ever could be.Basically a new villain is around, the Joker. Also a new district attourney named Harvey Dent is helping to end crime in Gotham. Batman also is beginning to have his image tainted and hopes that he will not be needed one day.I once again liked the overall serious tone in this film. That helps to make the conflict seem more real and problamatic. It is great for these new Batman Films to have this tone and hopefully they stick with it.Loved the new character of Harvey Dent. He is great both as Harvey Dent the District Attorney and later as Two Face the coin flipping killer.I think Christian Bale is great as Batman once again. Bale is good at playing Batman and I look forward to seeing him in future films.Heath Ledger plays the Joker. While an interesting performance and one that is memorable, I think that his performance is completely over rated due to his death. If he had not died I do not know how much credit he would have gotten or how much hype the film would have gotten. I do feel bad that he died, but this performance is not as great as people say and somewhat disturbing at times.Scarecrow gets to show up for a little, which is interesting.I think this film dragged at times. It seemed like there are too many things going on and stuff that should have been cut out.Also Batman could have been in this film more. This film is somewhat similar to Spiderman 2 in that Spiderman is absent for much of the film as Batman is absent from this film for a while as well. But when Batman is on screen he is great. I really like Batman.Also I hate the new actress that played Rachel. Why did they change actresses? Katie Holmes was way better and it would have helped if they had found an actress who LOOKED LIKE KATIE HOLMES AT LEAST! Idiots.The action is pretty good. Batman gets to fight dogs, the Joker, and some thugs. Also the effects and music were phenomenal.So I think this film was over hyped more than any film I have ever seen. It was very good, but not a masterpiece. Still, I recommend it.",8,1,5,10 May 2009
Taken," 'Taken' by Surprise.
","Prior to seeing Taken, I had no real expectations. I knew what the plot was about basically, but for the most part I thought it was a great film.Liam Neesan plays a man who once worked for the government in forensics or something. His daughter goes on a trip to Europe and gets kidnapped by a group of guys that put girls on drugs and then use them as prostitutes. Neesan's character then goes off to rescue his daughter using all of his abilities that he possesses.I thought the plot was simple and worked. Neesan loves his daughter and is great at forensic stuff. So him going off to rescue his daughter was interesting and exciting at the same time. Great story, one that is quite similar to that of 'Commando' except this time it is a former forensic guy, not a former military guy.Liam Neesan is great in this film. His calm and composed character fits well in this film and makes him a guy who you can cheer for. I think he was great in both 'Batman Begins', and 'The Phantom Menace' but I think this is easily his best performance in a film now.The action is pretty good too. There are great shooting scenes as well as great hand to hand combat scenes. Some of the better action in a film that has been made in recent years.I also think that the overall message and theme of the film is great. It shows what a father will do for his daughter. Most fathers can probably relate to this film and how a guy will do anything for his daughter.So I really liked this film. It has great action, a great theme, great story, and a great performance by Liam Neesan. I recommend it greatly.",9,1,4,25 May 2009
The Fly," Brundlefly
","The Fly taught me a valuable lesson. It is important for someone to see a film to understand what the film is about and not just take things you hear from other people to form an opinion.Seth Brundle(Jeff Goldblum) is a very smart and different type of scientist. After meeting a reporter named Veronica (Geena Davis) he shows her his latest invention. Brundle has invented a machine that will teleport inanimate objects into another machine. However Brundle has problems when trying to teleport living objects. After much work he finally is able to teleport a living baboon through and then he himself goes through it apparently suffering no problems. However unknown to him a fly was in the teleporting machine with him and as a result it has fused with him and slowly is turning him into a man fly.The main idea and story of this film is great. It is a great science fiction story, teleporting machine that can also fuse organisms together. But there is a lot of Horror in the film as well. So as far as being a good science fiction and horror film this film is quite effective.Jeff Goldblum is pretty good in this film. I really enjoyed his performances in Jurassic Park, The Lost World, and Independence Day. He really plays a good scientist with a little oddness in him in this film. He speaks in a way easy to hear and understand and also has great facial expressions and hand gestures. Also the scenes where he is with Geena Davis were really good and no doubt their real life experiences together help them to have such good chemistry.There are a lot of disturbing scenes in this film. To be honest, I thought this film would be about Jeff Goldblums character turned into a normal fly. However really he starts to turn into a man fly type creature. Very disturbing scenes are in this film. If you are a person weak in the stomach this may not be a good film for you. Brundle has to do a lot of vomiting in his fly form and it really is quite disgusting. But it does a good job of getting the point of the film across to the audience and really gets the mood of the film across as well.A good science fiction and horror film. It is quite disgusting at parts but those parts seem to help the film out. I recommend it to anyone who does not get disgusted easy.",8,1,2,14 April 2009
Rocky," Greatness with a Capital G.
","Rocky is a start to one of the greatest movie series ever in my opinion. While all of the films (except Rocky 5) are very good, the first Rocky film stands above all of them as the best of the series.Rocky Balboa is a boxer who also collects money. He is living in the slums of Philadelphia and is not really achieving what he should be. As luck would have it the heavyweight champion of the world selects Rocky as his next opponent due to the fact that he wants to fight an Italian on independence day in Philadelphia. This opportunity leads to Rocky starting to try to achieve things that he never dreamed of before.Often people refer to Rocky as a boxing film but it is so much more. THe acting in this film is great and so is the tone. There are a lot of scenes where characters are silent and reflecting on things that the audience easily can tell. Like how in the beginning Rocky is looking at himself in the mirror as if to say 'what happened to me?'.The interaction between characters is awesome. Stallone does an awesome job as ROcky and this is his best performance in a film. How he did not win best actor is beyond absurd. THis is acting at its best. Rocky first meets adrian in this film and this is where the relationship starts. Also awesome in this film is Paulie, Adrians brother. The character of Paulie is very important because it shows the side of envy and disappointment that many people relate too.While a few of the later films in the Rocky series are action flicks, this one is drama. THere is a lot of training and a great boxing match at the end but the story really is about Rocky and his relationship with several other characters like Paulie, Adrian, and Mickey. This film does an awesome job of developing characters which helps make the series endure for so long.WHo can resist an underdog story? Rocky working hard in this film is awesome. THe 'Gonna fly now' song is awesome as Rocky is training. THis is easily one of the most motivational films I have ever seen. Just thinking about Rocky training in this film makes me think that I can achieve anything.The boxing match at the end of this film is epic. Nothing quite measures up to it due to how it is set up. THe guy who has no business being in the ring with the heavyweight champion of the world. Rocky holding his own against Creed is spectacular.There are a lot of other emotional scenes but I do not want to give too much away. ALl I can do is recommend this film to everyone.",10,0,0,22 March 2009
Les Misérables," First Movie To Make Me Cry
","Les Miserables is a phenomenal film adaptation of the classic musical of the same name. It has tremendous acting and songs that help to set the mood of the film incredibly.Acting in this film was incredible. I really thought that Russel Crowe was great as Javert and he also was very good at singing which was a pleasant surprise. I thought that Anne Hathaway was very good as Fantine and sang the most famous song 'I dreamed a dream' very well. Maybe not the best I've heard that song but very good nonetheless. Also Sacha Baron Cohen was excellent as Thenardier, that was a character I remember the most from the play growing up and I thought he hit the character spot on.For me Hugh Jackman was the best part of the film. He was outstanding as Jon Valjean and made the movie for me. He really worked hard for this role and I thought it showed a lot. I don't wanna give away what part it was, but there was a scene in which he made me cry for the first time ever during a movie. I was very impressed with him and he moved me.I didn't think all of the cast was strong tho. I have never been a big fan of Helena Bonam Carter and so I didn't find her part that good in this film. Also I thought that Amanda Seyfield was not a strong Cosette as an adult. I did think that young Cosette was very good.I thought that most of the songs were well done in this film. SOme were stronger than others but the really good ones stood out. The whole movie was basically singing and they did a good job with it, but maybe a few of the weaker songs could have been edited. BUt I enjoyed the music in this film.I do say that this is not a film for all viewers. I wouldn't take young kids to go and see as there are a lot of dark parts and some violence.Overall, an amazing film. Acting (especially Hugh Jackman) was incredible and the music was amazing. I think that it should be nominated for best picture.",10,6,11,29 December 2012
Titanic," 'Iceberg Straight Ahead!'
",Titanic is one of the most successful films in recent history. It won a lot of Oscars and really is one of the better films that is based off a historical event.The effects are phenomenal in this film. The Titanic looks as how it should have and looks real. They really got the details down perfectly and it seemed as if each room shown in the film was flawless.Some of the scenes in this film are just awesome. Especially the scene where the Titanic hits the Iceberg. THe whole sinking scene in particular is dramatic and will keep you captivated.Acting is good for the most part. DiCaprio is pretty good in this film and this may be one of his better performances but I really have not seen that many of his films. Same with Kate Winslett. Actually acting may be the biggest weakness of the film but that is just because everything else is outstanding. I thought the captain of the Titanic was well performed as were the entire crew of the Titanic.Music is spectacular. Not much more to add.This is a really good film. Not a ten out of ten for me but a solid nine out of ten and a film that I highly recommend to the likely two people out there that have never seen it.,9,1,3,19 February 2009
Rocky III," Shift In The Series.
","Rocky 3 started a shift in the Rocky series. Instead of dealing with Rocky as an underdog trying to work his way up and establish himself, Rocky 3 has Rocky on top of the world.Rocky starts defending his title and knocks off ten different challengers. A new young vicious boxer, Clubber Lang, challenges Rocky. Mickey tells Rocky not to fight him because of the fact that Lang is a 'wrecking machine' and that all of the people Rocky had beaten previously were nothing like him. Rocky fights him anyways, however tragedy hits prior to the fight and Rocky loses to Lang badly. Apollo Creed then decides to help Rocky train and regain the look he had when he had fought him.Rocky 3 is different in tone than the previous Rocky Films. Rocky himself acts much differently. As Mickey says Rocky becomes 'civilized' and is not acting the role of the underdog who had to work hard to get what he wants. He is a millionaire heavyweight champion of the world, not a guy living in the slums of Philly who gets a chance to go against the heavyweight champion of the world. Rocky seems to be much more civilized and willing to converse in this film than he was in the other two. I can honestly say that I liked the Rocky from Rocky 1 and 2 better but it is interesting to see this change in character.Rocky 3 is an action packed film. Rocky gets in an exciting fight with Hulk Hogan at the beginning of the film for charity. Also Rocky fights against Clubber Lang TWICE in the ring. Rocky 3 has by far the most action of any of the Rocky Films.A few complaints. Number one I do not like the way that they killed off Mickey. I am not disappointed with the fact that Mickey dies, sometimes good characters die. I just do not like the way that he died. He gets pushed down by Lang and suffers heart failure. They could have killed him off in a different way that worked better.Another thing I did not get is how Rocky has the media circus surround him when he is training for his first fight against Lang. It is a complete circus and so unlike Rocky. Maybe this scene just was included to show how Rocky had changed and show how he is losing his edge but I still think it was out of place.Now for things I did like. I like the shift in character for Apollo Creed and how he helped Rocky to train. This is a perfect example of a bad guy becoming a good guy for the better, there are other times where this does not work. When Apollo decided to help Rocky out it completely surprised me and made me like Apollo better.This song has different music as well. Survivor's 'Eye of the Tiger' is the main song of the film and really goes well with the theme of the film, Rocky getting back 'The Eye of the Tiger'. Overall this is one of the best songs in a movie ever, it just goes good with the film. When Rocky trains with Creed at the end they do play 'Gonna Fly Now' but once again it is not the same version as used in the first Rocky film.So this is the most action packed of the Rocky Series, has a great shift in character for Apollo, and has a great theme song. It is not without its flaws but it is a lot of fun so it is worth seeing for that reason alone.",9,0,0,16 January 2009
Thor," As Mighty as Asgard.
","Marvel had been putting together a string of very unmemorable not so good films years ago with Ghostrider, Daredevil, and spiderman 2 and 3. However as of late there have been some great Marvel Films and Thor is one of them.Thor is to be the ruler of Asgard but has himself banished to Earth without his powers due to him going behind his fathers back and starting a war. His mighty Hammer is also sent to Earth and only he can ever possess the ability to use it again some day, but first must prove himself to his father Oden. Thors brother Loki plots to rule Asgard himself after learning secrets about his past.A major reason for this film being so good is the acting. The cast is phenomenal. Chris Hemsworth plays a very good Thor, I really bought his performance as the God of Thunder. Natalie Portman is great as always and Anthony Hopkins is always legendary, one of the best actors ever in my opinion.The story was also good. It starts with a flashback explanation on how Thor got to where he was. Very well done. Also there was a lot of funny parts that I found entertaining. NOthing too lame or anything so that was good.I also really liked the Villain, Loki. He was also well portrayed for his screen adaptation. And Destroyer was also really cool, even if the effects for his laser were really loud.Action was pretty good, Thor could have battled more when he was actually in control of his god like powers. However I am sure he will get to do more in his next films.This was very good film. I recommend it.",8,0,1,10 July 2011
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Disappointing.
","Going into seeing Transformers Revenge of the Fallen I had higher expectations than any film that I had ever seen before. I was disappointed with how many flaws were in this film.Basically the decepticons snatch the all spark and use it to bring Megatron back to life. THey then plan on uncovering a device that is capable of destroying suns. In a nut shell, pretty much that is the main conflict.I was hoping to see a lot of new transformers in this film. Sideswipe was a really cool new autobot in this film, but he is barely in it for more than a minute. Arcee seemed cool, but she is barely in it. The two main new autobots in the film are skids and mudflap who are easily two of the most annoying characters in film history. Seriously, could not stand them. The talked like they were from the hood and did nothing at all except annoy the hell out of me.Most of the main autobots from the first film are not in this film nearly enough. Even Prime has a very small role which is inconceivable. What were they thinking? Also for the most part in this film I think there are way too many human scenes and the humans seem too important. It was never like that on the show, sure there were humans around, but it was the transformers who were most important.Having to watch a film titled tranformers, and have to see humans for the most part was disappointing. I wanted to see a lot of new transformers and lots of transformers scenes and it did not satisfy me enough in either regard.The humor is very lame as well. THere are a lot of weird sexual jokes though out the film. It just made the film seem like a teen comedy and not a transformer film.The action was OK, but once again it was hard to tell at times who was winning and who was who.The film is not all bad though. I loved Soundwave and Ravage in this film. Both were awesome, although not in the film nearly enough. Megatron was cool once again, and so was Starscream. Devastator looked awesome(besides a certain part of his anatomy being present) but he did not do anything that cool.One more thing, the idea of Megatron having to answer to someone else in the Decepticon ranks is pretty impossible and unthinkable if you ask me. Just saying.So, while someone who may enjoy lame humor and pointless action may like this film, a true G1 Transformer Fan like myself did not. I do not recommend this film.",4,0,4,8 August 2009
Rosemary's Baby," Maybe I Missed Something.
","Having just watched Rosemary's Baby for the first time I figured I should write a review right now. FOr the most part I was disappointed and felt that I had missed something and had an empty feeling after finishing seeing it.For one thing the idea of witchcraft being possibly involved was actually a good idea. I just think it was poorly done. THis movie could have been a lot scarier and I thought it would be but it was not scary at all. It got disturbing towards the end to see everyone who worshipped Satin but it was not scary.A lot that goes on is going on inside of Rosemary's head. So it is a supernatural type of thing going on. So this is a supernatural horror film. A lot of people have bad things happen to them because of witchcraft but still this film just seemed to be missing something. It was not the acting, the acting was fine. Just the plot and events that happened just were not exciting and this film dragged too much.So this is a horror film that I felt was too long, not scary, and had a boring plot. I do not recommend it but a lot of other people do.",4,3,15,9 February 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Dark Side of the Force.
","Going into The Revenge of the Sith I knew what was going to happen in it already. However I did not know exactly how it was all going to happen in it. To be honest though, a lot happened in it that I did not expect and that helped out a lot.Anakin and Obi Wan must rescue Senator Palpatine from the trade federation and General Grievous. After doing so Padme reveals to Anakin that she is pregnant. Palpatine starts to develop a unique bond with Anakin. Soon Anakin has bad dreams about Padme dying and learns that the only way to save her may be to join the dark side of the force.I think that this film did a pretty good job of developing the characters. Anakin gets a good explanation on how he decides to join the dark side. However I always thought that he joined the dark side out of impatience and greed rather than out of necsessity to save his wife. Obi Wan is great once again and truly is a great character from this series of films. Yoda is awesome once again.The villains are awesome in this film. Palpatine is so evil and manipulitive and truly one of the most evil people ever in a film. In a way Palpatine really is the star of this film, convincing Anakin to the Dark side and just constantly coming up with one evil plan after another. I also thought that General Grievous was really cool. He is sort of a cyborg droid that has four arms and an evil machine like voice.What made this film so great for me is the action. Grievous's battle with Obi Wan, battle at Kashykk, Dooku against Anakin and Obi wan, and tons of other great scenes. This film in my opinion has the best action of any of the star wars films. Also the most lightsaber action which is spectacular.Once again the settings are great. I especially loved the volcanic Mustafar Planet and the sink hole planet of Polis Mas. Once again the special effects were legendary and I do not think that they went too far with them as they had in the other two films at times.TO be honest, I was sad at the end of this film. It was the end to a great series of films and I wanted to see more. Still, this is a great film though. Easily the second best of the Star Wars franchise and the best from the new series. Highly recommended.",10,1,5,30 April 2009
The Lion King," Tremendously Moving Film.
","The Lion King is one of the best animated films that I have seen along with Aladdin. It is highly moving and one of the most emotional films that I have ever seen.Simba is a young lion who is the heir apparent as King of the pridelands to his father Mufasa. However his evil Uncle Scar wants to be king. When tragedy hits Simba, he leaves the pridelands despite the fact that it is his destiny to be the next king.As far as animation goes, this is legendary. All of the animals look like they do in real life. The scenery is amazing.The songs are good also, not nearly to the level of Aladdins songs, but pretty good. However the non singing music in the background is outstanding.As far as villains go, I think Scar has to be one of the most evil. He is an evil lion who alligns with HYENAS!!!! In case you are not well informed as far as animals go, Hyenas and Lions are bitter enemies who hate each other. The idea of a lion turning his back on lion kind and alligning with hyenas is unthinkable. One of the most evil villains who does help make a great conflict.All of the characters are great. Especially Mufasa, voiced by legendary James Earl Jones. The lessons that he tries to teach his son are phenomenal and ones that envoke a lot of emotion. This film has a lot of moments that are tremondously moving and make me want to cry at parts. Also it has the saddest moment in movie history in my opinion, I wont give it away though.As far as voice acting goes, this film has the best cast to my knowledge. Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Johnathon Taylor Thomas, and many other great voices.Easily one of the best films that I have ever seen. Highly recommended.",10,2,2,4 August 2009
Back to the Future Part II," One of a kind as a sequel.
","Back to the future part two is a pretty good sequel, but it is unique in a few ways. I do not think it is as good a film as the first one, but it still is a lot of fun.After traveling to the future with Doc, Marty and Doc return to 1985. However upon returning they see that the fabric of time has been altered and now Biff is all powerful. So Marty and Doc must find out what went wrong and correct it.This film does a good job of picking up where the last one left off, however with a different actress as Jennifer this time. A lot happens in this film and it never drags ever in the whole film which is pretty cool. It is kind of like how The Empire Strikes Back has a lot happening in it,this film has that as well.Marty and Doc both are great again. The major character who gets more development in this film is Biff, and surprisingly he is a pretty funny character. I love the part where old Biff talks with younger Biff.This film is by far the most confusing of all three of the Back to the Future films. All of the time traveling is cool, but with so much going on and people almost running into themselves from other times it makes the film very unrealistic.This film is unique in that the last third of the film takes place within the first film. I can not think of any other film that does this. So I think that it is mandatory that you see the first film before you see this one.I think this is a great sequel to the first back to the future. It is not quite as good a film, but I recommend it. But make sure that you see the first film first or else you will get really confused.",9,2,4,13 February 2014
X-Men: First Class," Magn(eto)ificient!
","I have watched all of the X Men films that have been made to date. I found them all to be good enjoyable films. However this film, I found to be outstanding! Basic story involves Xavier and Magneto when they were younger. They meet up and recruit other mutants to work with the government and help to prevent war with nuclear missiles. Also another group of mutants led by Sebastian Shaw are trying to start a nuclear war all at the same time.The story of this film is good and easy to follow for the most part. I like the way it was set in the 60s and they do a good job of making it feel like this film took place before the other films did.I do have a few minor complaints. For one, this film does kind of have inconsistencies with the other films as far as continuity, but that also happened in Wolverine Origin. Its a good film, but a few things just seemed to not go together with the other films, but thats OK. For example how Xavier is shown able to walk in Wolverine Origin when he was older and how in this film Xavier uses a wheelchair when he still had hair. And the whole Mystique Xavier growing up together thing as well. This is just a problem that will happen with films at times, Star Wars seemed to have this happen as well.There is some good action, not a lot of great action tho. This is more of a character growth type film, not a constant fighting action flick.I think Xavier was great in this film. He really acts like a young Xavier would, James MaCavoy did a great job as him. Also I liked Mystique in this film as well. The young mutants were all OK, Beast was really good tho and probably the only new young mutant to stand out for me. Kevin Bacon was great as always as the villain Sebastian Shaw. Great casting choice by putting him in. Oh and January Jones was great as Emma Frost with her.....................acting.But what made the film for me was Magneto. I don't want to over rate it too much, but I found Michael Fassbenders performance as Magneto to be OUTSTANDING!!!! Better than Heath Ledger as the Joker in my opinion. Magneto is a deep character in this film, you get to see what his childhood was like and see him grow throughout the film. Easily the best Marvel Character ever in a Marvel Film in my opinion. I loved Magneto in this film, he was almost too awesome.So overall this film has a good story and good acting performances. Magneto made the film for me and was awesome. The best X Men film so far and one of the best Marvel Films too. I recommend it highly.",Null,0,1,22 October 2011
Iron Man," Tony Stark.
","Iron Man is a Marvel Film that is better than many other Marvel Films that I have seen recently.Tony Stark is kidnapped while he is over seas demonstrating some new weapons for the military. Once captured, he is forced to build a bomb but instead he builds a suit that he uses to escape from his kidnappers. As he returns home Stark decides that he must stop his company from manufacturing weapons and also begins to build a new suit that he can use to fight against evil.A major strength to this film is a strong lead character who plays the role greatly. In Spiderman I felt that they could have chosen a better actor to play Spiderman but I think that Robert Downey Jr. is great at portraying Tony Stark. Stark comes off as intelligent, funny, and in complete control in this film. Downey Jr. was a great choice as Iron Man and I look forward to seeing him in the sequel.The Iron Man suit in this film is awesome. The effects are phenomenal and outstanding at the same time. Especially the scenes where Iron Man is flying around. This really is some of the best special effects that I have seen in a film and it makes every scene involving Iron Man marvelous.I think the story is good as well. It is not too complex like another super hero film that came out the same summer. (Dark Knight) THe story picks up right away and the main conflict is upon the audience very soon. Also I like how you do not go through all of Tony Starks life and how he is given a brief back story at the beginning. This helps the story to get going.A few minor problems. For one, you really have to wait a while before Stark makes the real Iron Man suit. However I do understand that this is the film where they needed to show how the suit gets built and so on. You just have to wait a while to see Stark in the final awesome looking suit.Also I think Iron Man could have been in it a little more. It is cool seeing Tony Stark a lot, but it would have been nice to see him in the Iron Man costume more.The action is good in this film, but nothing too special. The final battle at the end is OK, but it left something to be desired.Also the supporting cast was nothing special. TOny Stark was awesome but the rest of the cast was OK. I can see why a lot of the cast is going to be changed for the next film. Sorry Terrance Howard.So this film is a lot better than the Fantastic Four films, X men films, and the Hulk FIlms. ALso I think it is better than SPiderman 2 and 3. It has a great leading actor, great effects, and a strong story and conflict. I recommend it.",8,2,2,11 June 2009
Ben-Hur," 11 Oscars Can't Be Wrong.
","With 11 Oscars Ben Hur proved to be one of the most successful films of all time. It is a masterpiece film that will live forever among the greatest films of all time. In all honesty though this film is perfect in every way and has no flaws.Refusing to go against his people, Judah Ben Hur sees his former childhood friend, Messala, send him to the gallows after an incident that was misunderstood. Separated from his mother and sister Judah vows to see them again as well as get revenge on Messala.The acting in this movie is awesome. Charlton Heston puts forth the best performance of his career and won the Oscar for best actor. Very well deserved and I think this is the best performance by an actor in a film ever. Hugh Griffin won the Oscar for best supporting actor which I think is fine but if anything Jack Hawkins should have won it for his excellent portrayal of Quintos Arrius in this film. Stephen Boyd also gives an outstanding performance as the villain Messala. Messala is in my top ten for the greatest movie villains of all time.The story is one that gets going and develops a great conflict for the protagonist. Watching Judah go through his struggles on his way to the gallows and in search for his family is something that will captivate audiences forever.The music rules as well. Great music is always around in great films it seems.The chariot race in this film is one of the best moments in motion picture history. I will never be tired of that scene and no other race scene in any other film compares with the chariot race. It is intense, exciting, and epic.Also love the scene when Judah is rowing for the Roman Fleet in the bottom of the boat. The intense sea battle is way under rated and nearly as awesome as the chariot race in this film.Perfect in every way including acting, music, and a great plot. One of the greatest movies of all time and one that I recommend to everyone forever.",10,2,6,5 February 2009
X2: X-Men United," A Little Better Than The First One.
","FOr the most part I thought the first X Men film was OK. I thought there could have been more action and a little more character development. I think that 'X 2' did a little better at character development and had a little more action.Wolverine is in this film about as much as the first film. I guess he is the most popular X Men member so he gets the most screen time. Wolverine does get in some more solid action in this film but I wonder with how much he is in these X Men films how much more they can show in the upcoming Wolverine film.Mystique is in this film a lot. She really is pretty important to the film. It is kind of cool how she is completely naked other than having some sharp patches on her and being blue. Magneto is kind of on both sides in this film as far as being both a good guy and a bad guy.I was hoping to see a lot of my two favorite X Men, Colossus and Ice Man. Colossus was awesome as he gets a brief scene where he attacks some guys who break into the X Mansion but that is it. He does not show up really at all after that scene. Ice Man is in this film a marginal amount and he got to show some dramatic scenes where he expresses his love for Rogue as well as how he tells his family that he is a mutant. But I was disappointed with how little he used his abilities. Could have been 'cooler' but at least he was a developed character.Jean Gray is pretty cool in this film also. Storm was OK, but I do not know something seems to be missing with her character. I also liked Nightcrawler and he is very important to the film and is developed correctly. Cyclops once again did not seem as cool as he was in the comics and does not get to do that much.I think the film does a good job of picking up where the last one left off. It has pretty good flow and there is a lot happening. But there is a lot of good action about a half hour into the film in the X Mansion scene but that is the best action part of the film. THere are other action scenes but nothing as good as that part so after the X Mansion scene there is nothing as good as that. I expected a better final showdown at the end of this film against Magneto, better than the one in the first film but there was NO SHOWDOWN with Magneto in this film. The ending I thought was kind of boring.THere could have been more action but what they had was pretty good, not great. THey do a good job with certain characters portrayal though and that is a big improvement from the first film. A little better than the first one but still has some flaws. I recommend it over the first one.",6,3,5,25 February 2009
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Start To Something Great.
","Star Wars (A New Hope) was the first Star Wars film ever made. It is truly a great film and does a great job laying the foundation for future Star Wars Films.Princess Leia has hidden tapes that display plans to the Empires ultimate Weopon, the Death Star. She is captured by Darth Vader but manages to get the tapes into R2D2 and he escapes to the planet Tatooine. There he is bought by Luke Skywalker who learns about Leia being captured after meeting up with Obi Wan Kenobi, whom Princess Leia had hoped R2 would run into. Luke decides to go with Obi Wan to rescue the Princess. In Mos Eisley's spaceport they hire a vessel consisting of Han Solo and Chewbacca and thus begin on an adventure that will change all of their lives.This is a great start to the Star Wars franchise. Star Wars does a great job of introducing all of the characters that are so important to the Star Wars films. Luke Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, Darth Vader, and Han Solo. They all are great. Also it establishes the main conflict of the film right off the get go. Because of how great they do of establishing characters and conflict it allowed the sequels to succeed as well and further continue from this film.Also the story is awesome in this film. Luke Skywalker, a farmer, becoming a jedi knight and going on an adventure to help rescue the princess. This is a great story about how someone who thought they were nothing becomes something that is truly needed.The action is legendary. There is plenty of laser fire in this film and who could forget the epic attack of the death star towards the end of this film. Films like this show that you do not need constant action through the whole film at every part. There is great setting up of events prior to much of the action taking place. This helps establish the conflict and allows for the audience to understand the situation and why the action must take place.Music is awesome as well. Star Wars always had the best music of any film. However Star Wars does not have nearly as good of Music as 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi'. Or even as good of music as was in the three new Star Wars films.A few minor complaints can be attributed to the films budget probably. I do not think that Darth Vader looks nearly as good as he does in the other films. Do not get me wrong though he is great though, just not as cool looking as in the other films. Also at times the blasting back and forth causes problems visually but nothing major.A great start to something great. A legendary film that helped spawn the greatest movie series ever. Highly recommended and it will leave you wanting to see the sequels as well.",9,0,0,29 March 2009
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Greatest of the Star Wars Films.
","I love the Star Wars films as a whole. However I feel that The Empire Strikes Back is easily the greatest film of the series and one of the greatest films ever made.The rebels are forced to flee from the ice planet of Hoth after the Imperials discovered their hideout there. Solo, Leia, Chewbacca, and c 3P0 take off in the Millennium Falcon. Luke meanwhile travels to the Dagobah System to learn from the jedi master Yoda. Darth Vader then puts all his efforts into capturing the Millennium Falcon as to lure Skywalker to him. Vader then plans to turn Skywalker over to the dark side of the force.The main reason for this film being awesome is that there is so much going on. There really is no main setting and instead see various awesome settings. The ice planet hoth, swampy Dagobah system, asteroid field, cloud city of Bespin; it just is great how there are so many different places where action takes place in this film.The action in this film is legendary. Battle of Hoth is awesome and the imperial AT AT walkers are really a spectacle to behold. The asteroid field chase with the millennium falcon is also great. Also who can forget the legendary lightsaber duel at the end between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. I certainly never will forget that duel, to me that is the best moment in Star Wars history.This film does an awesome job developing characters. Solo and Leia develop a romantic relationship that I think fits the film well. Also the character of Chewbacca is portrayed more as a great companion and useful at helping out rather than just as a lumbering brute as he is in the first film. Luke starts to use the force more and develop into a jedi. Darth Vader also goes from being just an evil villain in the first film and becomes a legendary villain also capable of making outstanding strategies. Vader in this film is the greatest villain I have seen in a film and the way that he is portrayed in this film is awesome and the best portrayal of a villain in a film.New characters are added in this film. Lando Calrissen gets his first appearance. I do not really like or dislike Lando that much. Yoda make his first appearance in the Star Wars franchise. Who can not like Yoda? Yoda is easily one of the most powerful presences in a film and a master of the force. Frank Oz does an awesome job portraying Yoda. But to me the best new character in this film is Boba Fett. Fett is a great bounty hunter who will hunt down people in constant pursuit. Fett is my favorite Star Wars character and he adds to the films overall tone of suspense and unease in this film.The music is phenomenal in this film. This is the first film to use the Imperial March song and that film goes great with Darth Vader. When it is played at the same time as when Vader is on screen it is outstanding. Easily one of the best musical scores ever in a film, hats off to John Williams. Deserved to win an award for Composer of the year.Great music, action, lots going on, character development, great new characters, this film is the best sequel ever made and also the best of the Star Wars films. Recommended to the highest.",10,1,2,11 April 2009
Aladdin," Best Disney Film.
","Aladdin is the best of the Disney Films. I love this film and truly consider this one of the best films ever made as well as probably the best animated film I have ever seen.Aladdin is a street rat who must steal in order to make a living. He falls in love with the princess of Agraba, Jasmine. However only a prince can marry a princess. However when the evil sorceress Jafar must use Aladdin to go after a magic lamp, things start to change for Aladdin.Everything about this film is awesome. The artwork is phenomenal, and the music is legendary. 'A Whole New World' has to be one of the best songs ever in a film.Aladdin is a character whom people can get behind. Everybody loves seeing a rags to riches story and this definitely qualifies and makes it that much more enjoyable.Genie, voiced by Robin Williams, is outstanding beyond belief. Williams performance as a voice actor is so epic that the character of Genie actually acts like Robin WIlliams and uses his style of comedy. I have never seen a voice actor perform a character so well that the voice actor actually makes the character act like them. But this is one of those rare instances. I think that is one of the main reasons why this film stands out and it did start the trend of getting big name actors to do voice over work however no celebrity I believe has done it as well as Robin Williams.Jafar is also a great villain. One of the best of Disney and one that really makes the audience hate him.Frank Welker also gets to star in this film both as Abu and the Cave of WOnders. THat is great because he is my favorite voice actors.The action is phenomenal. Comedy is great. Characters are awesome. Highly recommend this film.",10,1,2,4 August 2009
Back to the Future," Timeless Classic.
","Back to the Future is one of the best movies ever made. It has a great stroy, has funny lines, and has great characters as well.Marty travels back in time accidentally by using Doctor Emmett Brown's time machine. There he must figure out a way to get back to the future and also get his parents to fall in love since he accidentally interferes with their first meeting.The story is great in this film. Time travel is a tricky thing but I think that this film does a simple job of explaining it so that general audiences can understand it more. However it still has a lot that confuses me but I guess with time travel in a movie the more that you think about it the more that you will have your mind boggled. So it is best just to accept what happens and not over think it.Marty is a great leading character who people can probably relate to. Michael J. Fox is awesome as him. Also Christopher Lloyd is amazing as Doctor Emmett Brown, this is probably his best acting performance in a film. Overall the relationship between Marty and Doc is believable and well done and it is one of the major things these films have going for them.The main antagonist Biff is also great. He really is just the type of jerk that seems to exist in a lot of 80s movies.The conflict of the story is great and it really keeps you at the edge of your seat. No matter how many times I see it, this film still keeps my attention even though I know what will happen.The score and song selections in this film are also well done.I highly recommend this film. If you have not seen it, do so right away and you will not be disappointed.",10,2,5,13 February 2014
Jurassic Park," Greatest Dinosaur Film Ever.
","Jurassic Park is the greatest dinosaur film I have ever seen. Its great effects, acting, and plot all lead to it being so awesome.Using dna and genetics, dinosaurs are brought back to life. They are put into a giant park called Jurassic Park. The creator of this place calls in several people whom he hopes to convince that this is a good idea for a tour of the Park. However soon problems start to take place and dinosaurs start to make the people on the tour go extinct.The story is awesome in this film. Using dna and old amber, I could really see this happening. I know that it really could not but it really does seem to make sense in a way. In the past dinosaurs in films always seemed to be hiding in a place far away from humans only to be discovered. But I like that this film has a new unique idea on how to bring dinosaurs back. Of all the ways to bring dinosaurs into a film I think this works good.The characters and acting in this film are great as well. Sam Neil is great as the paleontologist Grant, one of the best performances by an actor that I have seen and also one of the most under rated performances of all time. Laura Dern is really good as Dr. Sattler. Also I loved Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm, another great character and performance. Goldblum is hilarious in this film. I will say that I think the two little kids in this film are really annoying, but then again I do not think I have ever seen a film where I liked every character.As good as the people in this film are, the dinosaurs are just as good. They look great, as good as it gets. The Tyrannosaurus is great, has a loud echoing roar and walks without his tail dragging and rather using it for balance. The scene where it breaks out of the electric fence is legendary and really exciting. Easily the best dinosaur in movie history in my opinion.The star dinosaur in this film though is the Velociraptor. For a long time in films the predatory dinosaur was always either the Tyrannosaurus or the Allosaurus, large predatory dinosaurs with power. But Velociraptor in this film instead depends on speed and intelligence as well as sharp teeth, claws, and working in groups. SO this film does great at giving a new predatory dinosaur to the viewing audience. Kind of cool how the smaller Velociraptor can be just as scary as the larger Tyrannosaurus.Another thing I thought was cool was the Dilophosaurus. A really not well known dinosaur, but this film helps people to see it. Pretty interesting how it has a frill pop up from its neck and can spit venom.There are tons of great scenes in this film. You will have to see most of them to understand how great they are. I do not want to spoil it for anyone.The music is awesome as well.SO this film has it all, great acting, plot, action, and most importantly Dinosaurs. There are no films I can recommend more to see than this film.",10,3,5,9 April 2009
