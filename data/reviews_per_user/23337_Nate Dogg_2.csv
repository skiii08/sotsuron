The Blair Witch Project," Whose afraid of the Big 'Blair Witch'?
","First of all, 'The Blair Witch Project' is NOT a horror movie in  the way all these teen slasher movies are these days.  It's way worse than that. After watching these 3 'actors' in the woods for nearly an hour and a half, me and many like me in the theater kinda went, 'So?'  It was different and kind of neat with the first person perspective.  And that's pretty much all it had going for it.The most disturbing thing about the movie is that people think that it's real.  Why would a true story shot with real footage have directors?  Can you imagine the legal implications of releasing this movie if it were real? I heard a comment leaving the theater from a girl who said, 'If it wasn't real, they did a very good job making it look real!'  Of course it looked real! It was shot with a 16mm camera by people running through the woods. But it's not a true story, and the Blair Witch doesn't exist, not even as a legend. It was made up by the directors and fueled by internet sites that the staff of the movie created.As a suspensful artsy flick it was great.  The only problem is not too many people like artsy movies that look this bad.  As 'the scariest movie ever' it sucked and fell way, way short of expectations.  If not for all the profanity (of which there is quite a bit) this movie could have been rated PG, with no gore, no sex, no drug use, no violence to boost it any higher.In August of 1999, I dissapeared into a theater near Escanaba, Michigan while going to see a 'documentary.' One and a half hours later, my money was wasted.",3,0,1,7 August 1999
Scary Movie 2," This is just ridiculous...
","And not in a ridiculously funny kind of way, either.  The pressure to put out a sequel to a movie that is only a year old definitely took it's toll on this film.  As you may have guessed the gross out humor was piled on pretty darn heavy and many times it just looked idiotic. There really is no plot or story to speak of, the movie just runs from parody to parody (some good, some painful to watch.)There were, thankfully, some good parts to this movie.  Kathleen Robertson, first of all, is just gorgeous.  Christopher Masterson 'blew up' (see the freezer scene, you'll understand) in the role of Buddy in my opinion.  Some of the parodies were good, ('The Exorcist', 'Charlie's Angels') but not quite on par with other spoof movies like 'Hot Shots' or, another Keenan Ivory Wayans project, 'Don't Be A Menace.'  Marlon Wayans was good at times as Shorty, but overdid it in spots.There were terrible parts also.  Anna Faris, for as good as she looks, can never get that same goofy look of her face the whole movie.  It really gets under your skin. Chris Elliot and the part he played, Hanson, were an abomination.  Shawn Wayans...oh, nevermind. Although no plot was intended, the choppiness and confusion that the storyline brings is 'nails-on-a-chalkboard' annoying. The list goes on, but I'll spare you.So all together, I wouldn't waste my time to see this movie. And when Scary Movie 3 comes out, I think I'll roll right on past the theater. You've been warned.",5,0,0,4 July 2001
