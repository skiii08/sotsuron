The Blair Witch Project," HIP, SCARY, FUN, BORING...!!!
","Imagine yourself and two other of your close friends, go into an easily looking woods to get out of, but get lost. Now, you are stuck in the Blair Witch Project, where you, the viewer are right up close with the people filming. At night, you hear noises of your friend screaming in the woods, and your tent starts to shake, and before you saw these sticks that looked like people hanging from trees, and you also are running for your life. Viewer beware, this is what happens in the Blair Witch Project.But don't believe it is real. You have to look up for some background information on this hit movie. When I went to see it, I thought it was real, but how could it be when Heather Donahue was on the Tonight Show in mid 99. The movie was said to be filmed in 1994, which is a lie. But this movie does drag just a little when Josh and Heather start to fight over the camera. The ACTING is so life like and superb. I really liked this movie. The ending doesn't really symbolize anything, nor does it make any sense. But I do not want to spoil it for anyone. Let me just say it takes place in an old cabin/house when Heather and her friend hears Josh screaming. The end was just plain dumb.",Null,0,1,21 October 1999
Halloween," CREEPY, FUN, SCARY.....
",This movie is one of the best suspense/horror movies ever made. John Carpenter directed a great film. Halloween 2 is even better than Halloween because it gives the feeling of Halloween night. Jamie Lee Curtis (Laurie Srode) was absolutely magnificent!,Null,0,0,10 October 1999
