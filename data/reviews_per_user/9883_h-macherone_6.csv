Casablanca," Casablanca
","Lovers from the past find each other once again in Casablanca during the early years of World War II. Rick, a tough and seemingly cold American ex pat is reunited with the love of his life Ilsa when she walks into his Cafe, years after she left him waiting for her at the train station in Paris. When Rick comes into possession of two letters of transit the two plan to leave Casablanca together but he instead chooses to make sure Ilsa is safe away from Casablanca and gives her away to her husband.I'm sad to say that Casablanca was not exactly what I expected. Even with a little background information on what was taking place during the film, it was still rather difficult to follow with what seemed like lots of characters thrown into the mix. The flow of the film seemed a bit inconsistent; slow for long periods with small bursts of important information. Being referred to as one of the most romantic screen plays of all time, I was a bit let down to see little romance and was little there was, lacked in true on screen chemistry.Although my first impression of the film was not the best, I believe it is one that deserves to be a watched a few more times in order to understand and follow it better.",6,2,3,9 March 2015

","CLASSIC! A visual masterpiece! The strongest variable of this film, and its over all success is due to its beautiful lights and cinematography. The film contained many interesting and even long shots. the film also had very good sound quality for its time. Even so, I would recommend watching this film with subtitles, as it can get a bit tricky to follow.Orson Welles is charming and impressive, a very good actor. The entire cast was rather impressive and had good on screen chemistry but Welles was the more obvious of the cast that really new how to talk, how to act. Although there are a few short moment in the film that drag through the story line, the cinematography and lighting is there to pick up the pace. Again it is a film that may need more than one look at but is worth the watch! I myself will need to see at again at least one or two more times to get the full appreciation out of the film.Excellent.",9,2,4,13 May 2015
Taxi Driver," Taxi Driver
","This film is quite anxiety filled, at least for me. Robert De Niro ha been a favorite of mine for a long time and has never seemed to let me down. His acting type is very diverse and interesting. Knowing this makes his a threat to any film, for you never what to expect.Robert De Niro plays a rather unstable war veteran who is now a taxi cab driver in New York City. Through his over whelming urges of violence he attempts to save an under aged prostitute. The strongest aspects of this film would have to be the cinematography, editing, and event the sound. Like many films the soundtrack can be key to executing scenes with dramatic build. The editing was most interesting during faster scenes. Not a bad film, also not one that needs to be watched more than once to get the picture the firs time around.",7,0,3,13 May 2015

","Fantastic! Beautiful and charming, a true classic. The on screen chemistry was is was really draws you in. The use of color and sound was fluid and consistent. Not much to mention of editing or cinematography except for a few impressive long takes. could have bee a 10/10 maybe if not for the long and notorious Broadway scene. When the most famous silent film stars are faced with the transition to sound films, there are many obstacles they must over come. Don and Cosmo, old pals, grew up together entertaining making their way to the big screen where they find success as a team. Renowned and loved by many, Don tries to break ties with his on screen lover and their publicized fake relationship to make room for his true interest, Kathy, a beautiful and talented singer and performer who is the perfect match to Don and Cosmo's trio. With Kathy's help they are able to make the transition to sound much smoother.Film contains rich color and sound. There are many fun and fantastic dance and musical numbers that leave you begging for more. The on screen chemistry is a real treat. This is a film everyone needs to see at least once in their life... GO SEE IT!!",9,0,2,12 May 2015
Pulp Fiction," Pulp Fiction
","Very strange film but one to be expected form Quentin Tarantino. I am typically a fan of the majority of QT's films but the film proved to be a little too much for me. It may have been that I was not expecting such content from of film that was this old. Usually when I see a film closer to 'my time' I am pretty confident in what to expect in general terms of filming but also the extent of the content.The collaboration of actors was nice and the on screen chemistry was entertaining. These are all actors I think that work well together.This film to me really interested me in terms of color usage. Not entire why this but I feel that many of these colors were intentional within certain scenes.I enjoyed being taken into 4 different stories of violence and vengeance. Not sure if this is a film id like to see again, at least not for a while.",6,0,1,13 May 2015
Psycho," Psycho
","One of my all time favorites, Hitchcock never fails me. This film is dazzling and suspenseful, brutal and beautiful.This film starts off with out lead women, haunted by guilt when she decides to steal thousands of dollars from her job and decides to leave town. Fate catches up to her at the bates motel where she is murdered. After the death of the main character so early on in the film, her boyfriend and sister come looking for her, hoping to solve the mystery of her disappearance. By doing so, we are brought into the mind of a psychopath.This film, like Hitchcock's other films ,are extremely suspenseful and fun. The cinematography in combination with its editing is lighting is sublime. all of these things support the movie strongly but would be nothing without the soundtrack. The music is what really puts this film over the edge with its dramatic build and loud interruptions. A true classic.",10,1,2,11 May 2015
