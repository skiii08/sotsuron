Requiem for a Dream," Loved it!
","Call me morbid for 'enjoying' this one, but if you see it, I'm sure you'll agree.  Ellen Burstyn should at minimum be considered for an Oscar.  Her scene when she talks to her son on his only visit to her is gut-wrenching - pathetic yet so sincere and real.  A stunner!Louise Lasser (Mary Hartman!  Mary Hartman!) is in this one, but I didn't realize that til the closing credits unfolded.  She was unrecognizable. So keep a lookout for her.All of the performances were very very strong.  This is a stunner of a film.",9,0,0,21 November 2000
