The Monuments Men," Great Story Bad Movie
","This was a lousy film and George Clooney's performance was really 'stupid'. Mr. Slap happy, putting together team of goof balls to save the worlds plundered art? You've got to be kidding me. After reading the book I can't believe that Clooney could come away with this kind of an interpenetration. I'm certain if the original Monuments Men could see this film they'd be rolling over in their graves. The movie was totally dis-respectable to those great hero's. This was a great story that was completely ruined by George Clooney. The National Geo documentary was the real story. I really hate it when they 'hollywoodize' true story films and try and turn them into a comedy. I wouldn't give this film a quarter of a star!!!",1,160,274,15 February 2014
