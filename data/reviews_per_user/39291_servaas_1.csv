Vertigo," Masterpiece of suspense
","When I saw that this movie was 'only ranked' around place 30 I was quite surprised. Not only because this movie is generally viewed as Hitchcock's best (and several other Hitchcock movies are ranked higher on the list) but also because this movie is ranked at number two at the famous 'Sight and Sound'. The plot of the movie is almost incomparable: the viewer is slowly seduced in Scottie's world with all its shortcomings. The music is well chosen: it fits on the one hand the quietness, but one the other hand the tension that can be felt during the whole movie. On his quest for truth the viewer is first mislead on a subtle way. When the movie proceeds the sky becomes clearer. The abrupt end however, leaves the viewer with a 'uncomfortable' feeling: the feeling to put all acts together, to get a better overview. This non Hollywood end makes the film very unique: once out of the cinema one has no possibility not to think/reconsider the movie.",10,2,4,9 December 2003
