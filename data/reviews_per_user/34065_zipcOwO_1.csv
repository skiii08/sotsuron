The Lobster," Comedy? Romance? seriously I don't think I can trust the rating here anymore
","I've created my account for many years and it's my first time writing a review. I was looking for a romance movie from a list provided by IMDb and found this movie ranking at a relatively higher place. The plot was pretty interesting and innovative so I decided to watch this movie. However, the movie is so violent that it was a psychological torture. I couldn't really laugh at anything in the movie even if it is counted as a 'comedy'. Not to mention the romance part. I just hope that a sign could be placed on every movie like this to warn people about the content. This is just too violent and I couldn't stand for that. I might be lack of any sense of art to admire or appreciate this movie. It's just too disappointing.",1,13,17,3 June 2016
