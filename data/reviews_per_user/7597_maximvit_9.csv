Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Yet another exciting pirate adventure, but as expected worse then the previous ones
","The fourth part in the majorly successful saga of Jack Sparrow and fellow & non-pirates fills exactly all of my expectations for this movie: a new swashbuckling adventure, packed with action and fantasy but with a missing lack of hilarious quotes that the first three movies possessed.Johnny Depp is amazing as usual, the technical elements are outstanding as usual and the movie has some funny moments, but still less and some less funny or felicitous as in the previous movies. On a hand, i might even a bit miss Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, since there has to be someone in a movie that you dislike a bit for its particular honesty and general lameness, if you understand what I mean.Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a movie that i enjoyed, since i really like the whole series, but is still yet another proof that there is a low chance of sequels beating the original. Maybe the reason is Rob Marshall, who replaced Gore Verbinski and the screenplay-writers that replaced Stuart Beattie. But actually - i don't really care. I expected this to be worse then its 'ancestors' and it was. But it was still a great movie.",7,1,4,22 May 2011
Spider-Man 3," Visually stunning, stylized, underrated superhero movie
","There is probably going to be lots of disagreement here, but I think this is the best Spider-Man movie out of Sam Raimi's trilogy.Spider-Man 3 picks off where Spider-man 2 ended: with Peter Parker and MJ dating, growth of popularity as Spiderman, but of course, there are some problems. A strange black sludge starts to posses Spiderman, a new villain named Sandman appears and Peter's best friend, Harry gets the Green Goblin's gadgets and becomes the New Goblin in order to avenge his father.This is probably something where we will agree: visually, it is the best. The stunning birth of Sandman, the intense mid-air fight between Spiderman and the New Goblin, the creepy black sludge and the spectacular ending fight scene are all amazing and would have deserved an Visual-effects Oscar more then Spiderman 2.But not just in technicals, I think this movie is better then Spiderman and Spiderman 2. The storyline is well great, even tough there are basically three villains, it is still well put together to go with the relationship between MJ and Peter and the murder of Peter's uncle. The actors all do just as good, (and that is very good) job like in the first two movies and this is probably the funniest movie out of the three as well.",Null,1,1,4 September 2011
Kung Fu Panda 2," Nice, but wearing the curse of the sequel
","Sequels are almost never better then its originals. The Bourne Ultimatum and Kill Bill: Vol. 2 might prove me wrong, but those are more like final parts of a three- or two-part story, so it is true anyway: sequels rarely beat originals. And so it is in Kung Fu Panda 2 as well.The animation is breathtaking, the humor very fun, the kung-fu action extremely stylized, the story fine and morally educating to children as the original Kung Fu Panda, but it is still a tiny bit worse. But it is nothing wrong with that. As i have learned from watching many sequels, i expected it to be worse and Kung Fu Panda 2 is still a very fun, spectacular movie for children and adults of all ages.",7,1,2,11 June 2011
Batman Begins," An action-packed, dark and stylized re-beginning.
","The problem with rating this movie is that i watched it after i already heard for the greatness of its many to be considered better sequel, The Dark Knight (which have i not watched yet).Anyhow, this movie still is a very good action thriller as a re-beginning in the world of Batman. The brilliant director and writer Christopher Nolan outdoes himself once more and even tough this movie is often in the shadow of the Dark Knight, it still deserves some recognition. The acting is okay, the screenplay pretty good, but nothing truly amazing as compared to Inception, for an example and of course the technicals: sound editing, art direction and visual effects make the glorious action even better, especially featuring one of the greatest movie car chases i have ever seen.I think this movie is very good and leads up enough expectations until you have watched its sequel. Because of it, i am incredibly excited to once watch the Dark Knight, as it is a very fine Batman re-run.",9,1,2,13 May 2011
Super 8," The title is not the only super thing in the movie
","Super 8 is a very funny, spectacular and modern-made mix of a science fiction monster-destroying-a-small-town-movie and a family/kids/teen comedy. The main characters are young teens so the film is made for them, but at the same it is a very intense sci-fi mystery thriller.The film begins with a funeral of the main character's mother, which clearly marks him as a tragical parent loss. Four months later, he and his friends are working on an amateur movie with the Super 8 camera. Accidentally, they film a monumental car crash. Soon, the military air force arrives and mysterious events start to happen.The first two thirds of the movie, it is actually just building up suspense and playing with the viewer's expectations. Some scenes are very intense, but in a good way, just making you more and more interested about seeing the monster itself. Aside from the whole monster story, the movie follows the main character's typical and untypical young teen problems.The storyline is interesting and entertaining, the monster scenes intense and a bit frightening, there is lots of amazing suspense, but still on the level, that is okay for older children. The young actors are incredible and the humor is amazing. Super 8 is a great movie, in short.",9,0,0,13 August 2011
Limitless," A very good thriller, ruined by the ending
","Limitless is somehow similar to two other movies i watched: Deja Vu and The Adjustment Bureau. All of these movies are pretty good, but they are ruined by a quick, non-explain, Hollywood-y, happy ending. (If you watched any of these movies, you know what i am talking about.) If you haven't watched any of these movies i can tell you that Limitless is a pretty good thriller that makes you feel thrilled, what a thriller should do. Using the urban legend of humans not using 100% of their brain and a pill that can do so, the story is pretty good, but as again, the ending isn't so. Howewer, there also some other positive points in the movie: interesting action scenes, director's music-video-y scenes, an unexpectedly good performance by Bradley Cooper... but as again, the ending pretty much ruins the whole impression.",7,1,2,4 April 2011
Inception," A simply remarkable movie experience in every meaning of this word
","Inception is truly an unforgettable movie experience. I think the Academy does not like Christopher Nolan, because he hasn't been even nominated for Best Director. Honestly, i think this movie should have been the big winner of the Oscars, but that is just my personal opinion. If not, it would have truly deserved the award for Best Screenplay & Best Score.Inception can be sorted similar as the Matrix. It is one of those movies with a brilliant story that makes you think about yourself, the world and the existence of humanity, while it is also technically incredible. But first, the screenplay: it is simply remarkable and one of the best ever. A very intelligent plot, logical storyline, unexpected ending twist and also one of the best, most non-Hollywood and innovative ending scenes ever.There are also things in the movie, that deserved and have actually won an Oscar: cinematography, sound mixing, sound editing and visual effects. These four things are also amazing. A giant cliff falling into the sea, the streets of Paris bending itself, spectacular shootout at a what seems as an abandoned army base... All these scenes are great to look at, so Inception has both a brilliant screenplay and brilliant technical things.But there is another thing, that was also overlooked by the Academy: the score. A monumental Hans Zimmer soundtrack is an unforgettable piece of music, from the destructive Dream is collapsing, the energy-inducing Mombasa to the emotional masterpiece Time, Inception's soundtrack would have probably won an Oscar, if Hans Zimmer woudn't already had one in his collection.Combining all of these elements, there is nothing less then a perfect whole. And that is exactly what Inception is.",10,1,6,4 April 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A spectacular, melodramatic ending to an epic saga with slight glitches
","Harry Potter has been one of those remarkable franchises, truly comparable to Lord of the Rings or Star Wars. Even tough i am a huge fan, have read and loved all the books and watched and loved all the films, the finale of the finale isn't as it as perfect as it seems.Let's start from the beginning: The screenplay is wonderful as always and a proper ending chapter, just like in the J.K. Rowling books. The main actors are to live with as always and the veteran supporting cast, especially Alan Rickman, excellent as always.Technically, the film is amazing. It is far the visually best of the Harry Potter films and the most filled with spectacle and action. Even the un-action scenes, such as the shore near Bill and Fleur's house is also visually beautiful, while the enchanting Alexandre Desplat score fills out the missing pieces.The movie loyally follows the book, mostlyand will satisfy both the fans and the ones, that haven't read any. Even tough the movie is the most dark, mature and bloody of any in the franchise, it will satisfy a lot of people, because the spectacular action and engaging storyline will suck in even the non-fans.The ending is epic as it should be, explaining all the needed elements. But then comes the epilogue. The epilogue, showing the protagonists 19 years later, is done with some creepy aging effects, so we basically see Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Bonnie Wright and Tom Felton with different haircuts and clothes, some of them slightly reminding of Al Bundy and similar. The incredibly-badly done epilogue completely ruins the truly epic ending and will probably cause nothing but laughter.Harry Potter and the Deathly hallows: part 2 isn't as perfect as it might could be, but it still an incredibly good movie.",9,0,3,17 July 2011
The Social Network," One of the rare movies, that show programming realistic, but far from boring
","Programming doesn't sound very interesting, does it? Maybe with a few fictional twists that make it more appealing and understandable to the general public, but it is really hard to realistically explore the world of computer magic and make it so entertaining as in The Social Network.The plot follows the creation of the social network website Facebook, while also jumping in time forward to the lawsuit against Facebook's creator, Mark Zuckerberg. The Social Network isn't just a drama about programming and lawsuits, but also a story of friendship, love and betrayal.The Social Network has a lot of great points, so it is tough to pick out the best of them. Firstly,it has one of the best acting ensembles ever seen. Not just the Oscar-nominated Jesse Eissenberg, also Andrew Garfield, Armie Hammer and surprisingly Justin Timberlake are all outstanding and add a great plus to the movie.The writing and directing is also amazing, telling the story in an unique, intelligent and entertaining, while the stunning dialogs that simply explode out of the actor's mouths are only even better with the great actors. Of course, there are also te two other Oscar-winning elements: The music and the editing. Both are great, especially the score's main theme and one of the most epic scenes of past years: The Royal Regatta scene.In short, The Social Network, won't entertain only people who use Facebook and are interested in programming, but practically anyone who knows a good drama when he sees one.",Null,0,0,28 August 2011
