The New World," Mind numbingly boring
","I couldn't make it through the entire movie. Of the hour and fifteen minutes I wasted, only about 15 minutes of quality dialog and footage was heard and seen. The rest was filled with clips of treetops, rivers, grass. My wife, a die-hard Christian Bale fan, voted to shut it off before he even appeared in the movie. It wasn't worth her time either. The murmuring of Colin Farrell and Q'orianka Kilcher performed to themselves were incoherent at best. The way the film was shot was also hard to follow at parts. 1 second John Smith is with a group of Englishmen, next he is in a small canoe with 3 other men, then he is in the grass with 1 other man, then is in a swamp alone. The movie was very contextual, and was difficult to follow in many parts and made the film intensely boring. Avoid this film at all costs, unless you have a sleep disorder.",1,1,5,8 June 2006
