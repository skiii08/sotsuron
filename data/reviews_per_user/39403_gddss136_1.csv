The Lobster," This is a horrible movie! Might contain spoilers!
","This was a total waste of 2 hours of my life that I'll NEVER get back. You will be better off watching someone sit on a chair motionless for 2 hours. I cannot stress how incredibly stupid this movie is. I kept hoping that it'll get better, but instead it got progressively worse with each scene. The theme of animal ceuelty is vile. A woman kicks a dog to death and takes pleasure from it, rabbits are skinned alive, donkeys shot...only a psychopath could think of this and enjoy it. I do NOT understand those who gave this train-wreck a high rating. They must be thinking 'if I give a high rating to a non-conventional movie, I'm cool.' No, you're just stupid with odious taste. My dog's poop is more appealing to me to watch than this movie. Just like the protagonist, you'll want to gauge your eyes out by the end of it. I'm just gonna sit back now and wait for the Apocalypse. The human race is doomed.",1,42,73,15 June 2016
