The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Well worth viewing for any Twihards and good romance, action film
","OK Im biased as a Twilight fan I've been awaiting this film forever, but even so it was brilliant, I was most anxious about when Jacob would see and imprint on Renesmee, but it turned out for me the highlight of the film, the only downside i'm sorry to say is that it now seems there's a whole year till part 2 so how many times can i see part 1 again till then yippee seriously though I don't just recommend this film for twi-hards, any fans of vampire films should take a look, its a really deep romance and the action is great too, and admit it guys I've seen quite a few males reading the books now, so obviously vampires hold appeal for both sexes. Highly recommended If you don't like Twilight fine, but I recommend you at least give the film a go",10,0,9,10 December 2011
