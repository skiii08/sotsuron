The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," A Great Film
","Carries on from the previous films as Bella goes through an emotional journey. Recommended by the legal badge-12A. Most twilight fans will enjoy the exiting drama and suspense. Otherwise, the birth scene may be found disturbing for some. There is a lot of blood, so not recommended to those who are squeamish. According to reports the birthing scene in the movie has caused in-theatre seizures known as photosensitive epilepsy. It's believed that the bright flashing of red and black colours is causing the incidents. Personally, I enjoyed this film, due to intense plot and dramatic scenes. But this may not be everyone's cup of tea.",8,0,8,8 January 2012
