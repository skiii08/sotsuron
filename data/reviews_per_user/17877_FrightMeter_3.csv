The Blair Witch Project," Flawless...Intelligent..Terrifying!
","The Blair Witch Project is perhaps the most terrifying film ever to hit the big screen.  This film will only make sense or be enjoyable to you if you have the intelligence to allow it to.  If you are expecting the overdone stalk and slash, blood and guts genre, then please look elsewhere. The Blair Witch Project is an Oscar worthy film that explores the inner fears of the viewer and tugs at them like a freight train.  The final scene of the film is without a doubt the most disturbing ever filmed...Please pay attention to the interviews (specifically the one about the guy who slaughtered the kids in his cabin) or it will not have the same effect.   Excellent film that will redefine what a Horror Film should be!",10,1,3,2 August 1999
The Ring," An intense, intelligent horror film! (For Once!)
","First off, I HAVE to say that the negative reviews for this film seem to be coming from people who won't give it a chance simply because it is an American remake, or who do not have the intelligence to 'get' it and have been spoiled by the typical 'Hollywood' horror film.  This is very apparent by the poster a few reviews down who claims that movie is awful and 'what does Ring have to do with anything?' Well, I for one thought that was very well explained in the film, then again, I consider myself to be somewhat intelligent. 'Before you die, you see the ring' is the tagline for this film, so for those of you who didn't get it, let me explain real quick for you.  The last image that little Samara sees when she finally dies in the well is 'the ring,' the sunlit outline of the well entrance cover. 
Okay, with that explained, this is a GREAT film. The images we are presented with are among the creepiest in the history of film.  The pacing is excellent and the tension remains tight from the opening seen until the end of the film.  Naomi Watts is stunning and gives and exceptional performance as Rachel.  Definitely ranks among one of the creepiest, most vivid horror films of the last 20 years.  9 out 10.",10,0,0,24 October 2002
Halloween," A Classic.
","There is really not much new to say about 'Halloween' that hasn't been said before. Virtually every horror fan has seen this film and Michael Meyers has become somewhat of an icon.The plot is very simple and the film opens with a young Michael Meyers brutally stabbing his sister, Judith, to death on Halloween night. He is committed to an institution under the care of Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) who believe that Michael is pure evil. 15 years after murdering his sister, Michael breaks out of the institution on Halloween and makes his way back to Haddonfield to continue what he started years before by stalking a group of high school girls, including the virginal Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) who happen to be babysitting.The film is crediting for virtually creating the modern day slasher film and all the clich√©s that have come with it (though anyone who has seen 'Black Christmas,' which came out four years before this films knows differently). Still, John Carpenter gives us on hell of a ride with 'Halloween.' The tone of the film is foreboding to begin with and Carpenter does great at capturing the spirit of a small town Halloween. Once night falls in the film, Carpenter is a master us using color and contrasts to create tension and suspense. Michael's white mask is often seen in the background of a dark scene or room. The score is the best and most recognizable of any horror film in history and is an example of a score matching perfectly to the tone and purpose of the film. The final 20 minutes of the film-the confrontation between Laurie and Michael-remains one of the best chase/stalk scenes in film history. The music, the atmosphere, Curtis's acting--everything combines perfectly to create a heart-pounding climax.Often imitated, never duplicated, 'Halloween' remains the paramount example of a slasher film done right.My Grade: A+",10,0,0,6 May 2000
