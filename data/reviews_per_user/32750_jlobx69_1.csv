Scarface," 'TONY MONTANA'
",My favorite movie no matter how many times i see it. Especially knowing that Al' Pacino is in it aka Tony Montana. I love this movie cause it has that gangsta feeling in it. It was all about an American Dream which was gained by killing people and doing whatever it takes. It also relates to the real world of Cuba and Fidel Castro is all interesting. The surprising actions just makes me want to keep on watchin it.,10,2,4,21 April 2002
