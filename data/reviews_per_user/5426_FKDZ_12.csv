Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Still good, even now.
","It's hard to take off your nostalgia glasses when going back to a movie that is such a strong memory from the past, but today, as an adult I went back and watched this movie.It's still good.And most surprisingly, my time watching it flew by. Whereas with TFA and TLJ could drag on. I think a sign of any good movie is how strongly it pulls you in, and makes you forget about the world around you. This movie didn't fail that for me. Even more so, I think the popularization of this movie and the jokes/memes around it made it even more interesting to watch. The quotes, scenes and jokes land so much better now. I could see how anyone who saw the originals would hate this shift in tone in the prequels. But I loved the cheesiness of it, but it didn't lack heart either! Anakin leaving his mother, Qui Gon Jinn's death are great emotional moments.Now the most controversial character in all of star wars, Jar Jar Binks, the epitome of a utterly stupid character. In general I did not hate his antics, my only issue with Jar Jar was the amount of times he was used in intense action scenes, especially where the Gungars face the Droids on Naboo. There would just so many scenes of Binks being clumsy and somehow disabling a ton of droids it took out the emergence of the scene. And the fact many of his own people where being killed. Aside from that he was fine as a comic relief, and it was needed as he was the only one in the movie that wasn't all too serious. He was just edited in a bit too much.Aside from that, yeah some visuals are pretty damn bad and didn't age well. But honestly it didn't at all bother me aside from 2-3 scenes. The Pod Racing cgi is still great to this day. The droids sometimes look great, other times.. not so. And the Gungars... the biggest offenders pretty much look awful..all the time. But then again, it was 2001.The editing at times was a little odd as well, mainly during the main fight with Maul. The flow in that fight was weird in some places, and definitely right before Qui died. The saber effects also show their age. Although I tried pretty hard, I couldn't see many ''phantom'' hits whilst viewing. So even though I sawa those reviews and analysis videos where they show them hitting nothing at certain points.. I didn't see it in realtime.The acting.. is alright, Padmé, Qui and Obi are great, but the others are very much flat and dry. Chancellor Palpatine had some good lines, but the memes around it might have tainted me a bit.TLDR: All in all, I was afraid going into this movie because I thought I would HATE it now as an adult versus me as a little kid loving the fantasy spectacle. But no, its still good to this day, and after seeing TFA and TLJ, this definitely still beats those two in my opinion.",8,8,11,8 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A worthy ending. Well done.
","I think you can't really say this was ended poorly, and its quite the feat to end (the trilogy) such a franchise. And it definitely got me emotional during the ending celebratory festivities. An extremely well done story, with beautifully done characters and in a fantastic fantasy rich world with a exceptional score. What more can you ask for? Harry Potter and Star Wars are the only two franchises in the world that have had such a strong influence, and they deserve it.Now about this movie, now having completed my Star Wars watching journey, viewing all films from 1-6 as an adult, and not just childhood memories (primarily the prequels) I can definitely see that this movie showed a lot more of George Lucas's more ''out there'' ideas and decisions. From Chewbacca yelling the Tarzan call out to the super cute Ewoks. Compared to the previous movies this one felt a lot more ''prequel'' than the others as weird as that sounds.Is that bad? Not really, perhaps having seen the prequels its a little less jarring, but I still found these elements to be enjoyable (albeit the Tarzan yell was a bit of an eye roll).First this movie starts off in jabba's palace and I love that entire sequence, such a fun starter and with some nice twists to get everyone together again. Boba's demise was a bit awkward I think could've been handled more elegantly because he had quite a significant role in both films (mostly in the ROTJ). Him just rolling in the sarlacc pit was..eh. And this is honestly where another critique of my lays, Palpatine's death was incredibly underwhelming in my opinion, Vader just throws him into another endless pit (they should stop building those ;). Ofcourse before the prequels Palpatine had very little screen time so I guess they didn't care to give him a longer death scene.Another thing I had with this movie that I felt that it moved a bit slow around the midsection, before/during the ewok scenes. The other 2 films never had a real slow moment in them for me, the witty dialog would keep me busy or something else. In this movie I also found myself laughing a lot less and not enjoying the dialog as much, there are some odd scenes where characters feel a bit robotic. A notable one for was where Han and Lando say goodbye and Han lets Lando use his MF to attack the new death star. The dialog there felt edited oddly and very wooden.The directing was fine, I wasn't as amazed by the cinematography in this movie, I still think ANH has the best cinematography of the prequels and sequels.Also, I loved the twist of the death star actually being operational, did not see that coming. Too bad they only use it once though and is never really seen being used again.The fight between Luke and Vader when luke comes out of the shadows is amazing, the soundtrack there and how its shot gave me goosebumps, my favorite scene of the film, the entire confrontation with Vader and Luke are my favorite parts really.Now what about the Ewoks? I loved them, I mean.. I succumbed to the cuteness of them, so that wasn't the issue, but fact like I mentioned before is that they should've shortened the Ewok sections a lot more. Also now that I remember it, the speeder section suffered from the same issue of just dragging on for a little too long.All in all, I finished my journey watching all Star Wars movies and am super happy with how I feel about them, I was afraid I'd hate the prequels, and be overhyped for the OT.. But both of that didn't happen. Did the prequels have issues, yes.. a lot, were they still extremely enjoyable though, yes! Moving on to the OT from them just elevates that with better characters and better writing! If the OT has one thing its actor synergy/compatibility, thet mesh so well together and it just feels real.My full rating for all six movies go like this:1: 7.52: 63: 84: 105: 96: 9
For the sequels.. I fill need to see the finale for that but I don't think it will top either the OT or Prequels for me.SIDENOTE: Regarding the OT I watched the 2011 editions, with added CGI and slightly edited scenes. Some added CGI was a little too much, especially the stuff on Tatooine, but regarding the rest I felt perfectly fine with it. I think it helped watching 1-6 in order because you are already adjusted to the standard of CGI in the prequels, thus there isn't really a visible transition to the CGI in the OT.I definitely think some edits were needed and really good as well though compared to the original versions.",9,1,3,12 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Better but not great: 7.3
","First off wow, this movie is chaos, not persé in a bad way. But so much happens, and I shared this thought with the others I went to see this with in theaters.Do I think this was a decent ending to the ST? I do, it stays in theme of the ST, good and bad. But once again it tries to connect with the OT (and ignore PT) but it fails to do so for me.Things I liked:
1. Toned down the ridiculous amount of (bad) comedy and silly stuff in TLJ.
2. Rose, the ''crazed finn stalker fan'' has been toned down and is pretty much friendzoned in the movie.
3. Kylo dies, although personally still is an irredeemable character and his death was too ''good''.
4. Finn finally doesn't feel utterly useless, but the suggested love plot with the other deserter FO trooper is a bit weird with Rose still ''in the picture''.
5. Visuals, just stunning all around.
6. Rey and Kylo's relation and struggle, yes it has many faults, but it was good...before the kiss, let's forget about that.What I did not like:
1. May be surprising but the MUSIC, felt... weak. The only emotion throughout this movie I got was adventure and *star wars*. The entire movie felt so lighthearted, even though it had a lot of dark moments. I felt so much more sadness during Padmé's funeral than I did at Leia, nor Kylo.. And that was the prequels, and Padmé wasn't as instrumental as Leia, nor as charismatic/lovable. Rey's theme and Palpatine's theme were the only ones that stuck out, because they are amazing, but for the rest...not much.2. Kylo dies, of course he climbs out of the endless pit, used his ''lightside'' to heal Rey, give his life and die. (Darth Plagueis reveal? ;)... I guess thats fine, personally I'm not sure on this yet.3. Palpatine.... he's back, ofcourse. No I did not like this, and I felt like his voice didn't match up either. So what we are to assume is that he cloned himself, (as we see a snoke clone(?) in some fluid tank) and then raised an army from...somewhere. Like how does this work, did force palpatine clone himself? But how can you then ever kill the sith? He can just do this again?4. In the end the story felt weaker, it was more about the personal individual journey of each character, but they never had a focused pay off, why does Rey fail training at the start of the movie, but minutes later gets handed the lightsaber back (with some odd dialog from Leia) and thats it..she's good I guess?5. Rey and Kylo kiss, hmm. For someone that killed Han, Luke, Leia (indirectly) and countless rebels + planets he seems easily forgiven, he should have faded away before the kiss.6. I don't know why they try to keep making unique characters and troopers if they don't differentiate them. Zori Bliss, badass looking bounty hunter type, nope, just a cheesy love plot. Okay. What about these badass looking red stormtroopers? Exactly, they are storm troopers....but RED! Cool right?! (+extra sith jet troopers). Seriously I was so looking forward to a unique stormtrooper(s) and we got actually nothing! + Deserter horse girl wit bow and arrow, she was okay, but again, love-ish plot. Where are just the downright bad characters.7. Knights of ''who cares'', so Kylo trained these guys I guess by the name? Elite warriors, who.. walk around, always one step behind, and get killed by Kylo at the end because for some reason they are on Palp's planet.8. Almost FORGET, WTF HUX?! This plot twist is so damn weird. I feel like he just wanted out, and the writers had no clue what to do with him.9. Personally too much goddamn nostalgia callbacks. And I'm happy this saga is over so that they can CREATE the future nostalgia because half of this movie is OT characters doing their OT thing.
Well.. thats it so far. More negative things than I thought but all in all I stand by my 7.3, for what I expected, it managed to surprise me in some good, and bad ways, but it was fun.",7,0,6,22 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The weakest of the prequels.
","Overall I enjoyed this movie but much less than the Phantom Menace. What this movie suffers from is weak writing and CGI. The fact that Anakin gets so much character development is essential to his story, but the way that it is done is slow, flat and sometimes straight up weird.The acting in general in this movie is nothing to write home about, but really how can you blame the actors when all they are looking at are green screens for the most part? the abundance of CGI was detrimental to the entire movie. And must've been awful for the actors.The saber duels, especially the ones during the big battle also are just sloppy. Much more sloppy than the Phantom Menace where even though that had its shortcomings.. it at least didn't make using a lightsaber look clumsy and unguided.In general though, I was pretty shocked at how much my memory told me that certain events in the *next* movie revenge of the sith were in *this* movie. I was like ''when is this/that gonna happen'' So its pretty interesting that in my memory these two movies almost merged together. But it makes a little sense as this movie does end on a bit of a non-ending.In the end, this movie suffered from its CGI, weak writing and poor portrayal of the Jedi's and their skill. That said, I still enjoyed most of my time watching it, and certainly isn't ''revolting'' like some others may say.As a side note, the popularization/memes of the bad writing in this film actually made it much more fun to view. And it says something about taking the movie less seriously. I can still understand the hate from the older star wars fans though.",6,1,5,9 November 2019
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Decent.
","A decent Harry Potter movie that started strong but ultimately long winded and a tendency to drag on. Perhaps because this is the buildup to part 2, part 1 is a bit slow. But throughout the movie I found myself glancing away at times, not interested in the temporary teenage drama which seemingly is a recurring theme in all later Harry Potter movies, Harry, Hermione and Ron all run away from the group at one point in time, this movie no different.Secondly I found the directing a bit messy with odd cuts and extremely shaky and zoomed in shots during actons scenes, particularly during the forest snatcher scene. Also during the first escape scene where Harry meets Voldemort for like 5 seconds and boom its over, next scene, they were almost instantly both using their wands playing ''tug of war''.Thirdly there were some weird character inserts imo, Dobby felt forced in out of nowhere and *spoiler* let off in the finale just to give the movie some stakes.So in general I still enjoyed it, especially the start, but sadly it did tend to drag on, most likely because its the build up but alas, its still a standalone movie.",6,0,1,18 October 2019
1917," Nice visuals but thats just it.
","It really disappoints me this movie had nothing beyond fantastic cinematography, some decent acting and some great visuals.The movie lacks story, it lacks depth, it lacks emotional investment in the characters, and it failed at keeping my attention throughout.Now let's get this out of the way I'm not some guy who needs an action scene ever 5 minutes, good dialog would be enough for me but the writing barely even there.So far it seems like 99% of the reviews are about the cinematography and ''1 take'' filming style.This movie ultimately failed to make the audience care for the characters they had in front of them. It failed to show the absolute horror of world war 1. It failed to show the grime and dirt, the desperation in the men, of fighting this war of attrition.This is going to be a bit of rant review, because I was intensely excited for a WW1 movie, and general reviews (I didn't really want to spoil myself with more in depth stuff) were very positive.First of the grit, it seems like they didn't want to show the true horror of this war except through either some dead bodies or injured people in the medical bay. The full last ''action'' scene in particular was something that almost felt PG rated. I'm not asking to see legs flying everywhere, but gore is a part of war, especially the first one. And it missed the mark, why I take the biggest offense from because WW1 was ****** horrific. One of the worst wars in history.But that aside, the characters, William, a soldier that a care about why? They added a little personality to his mate that died, and that was a emotional and unexpected scene for sure. But then we just travel around with this empty shell of a human being. Which I guess, his journey was wanting to die in the war but after telling that brother and seeing his mate die, he realized he didn't want to. But It felt so unsatisfying.With the other people I went with we all agreed we didn't care for the character at all. We just weren't invested in what'll happen to him. And to be honest, I really was expecting him to die, to make fulfill that empty feeling and show the true side of war, but it ended with a happy ending..I guess.Another thing, those germans must be really stupid. A british soldier avoiding multipule german encampments, being spotted by flares. With that flare scene just being a ''cool visuals'' scene in the end. They never chased him down, we barely even saw them for that matter. Seemed like no one really cared for this one enemy soldier, even though everytime we meet a german they want to skin these guys alive seemingly.This leads to the scene with the woman and the baby, he gives food, and leaves, but again.. character development? What was the point of that scene?And wow, just the final scene once he delivers the orders, first he was told to get out, but being persistent he reads them, and okay.. call the men back. That's it? That's what I watched this journey for? No view of the germany's response or from the brits?Pfff.. I can go on, I'll leave it at this.6/10 for cinematography and visuals. The rest is mediocre and I would not recommend friends to spend money on this movie.",6,6,15,28 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Just sad.
","I don't know how we got here. It smells like greed and politics. And it ransacked this franchise. Went form a copy of ANH with TFA, and now we have ..this, pointless scenes, social commentary, and abominable writing. The only memorable scene I have from this movie is the fully silent space ship suicide.. only because it was something new. The other memories I try to supress because how Luke.. the casino scenes.. the asian girl saving finn in the most ridiculous manar, they are not jedi's, they don't have this force plot armor that allows them to do some unrealistic stuff.Lack of focus and a tight script is just what this movie screams to me. How could it go so wrong.Once again I caught myself just waiting of the action, the visuals, the spectacle, but honestly what else is there? Charismatic and well written dialog? A meaningful story? Characters I care about that have something to lose? NONE of that is here. And these problems already showed in TFA but I hoped we atleast saw them being weak for once in part 2.I will finish this trilogy and watch TROS but I can't help but not go in waiting to be disappointed and saddened with the direction this trilogy has gone.For me its final. The Prequels stand far above the Sequels. Even with the cheesy, wooden dialog, it atleast was interesting and I didn't find myself only watching it just for the action scenes.Let's hope their SW TV Show(s) can gain some trust back from us.5/10 , start making stories and characters we care about.",5,5,7,12 November 2019
Scream 2," Fun
","Definitely not as enticing as the original Scream, but it held my attention and kept its pace, even though towards the end the story became more comical than anything..The motive was also a lot weaker, and sadly the movie wasn't able to live up or get near the intensity of the opening in Scream.Is it a bad sequel, not really, but did it go beyond or try to be a little more interesting? Definitely not.",6,1,2,4 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A great finale.
","Just as the other 2 in the prequel trilogy this movie had its fair share of shortcomings, the directing isn't amazing, the writing falls completely flat sometimes and the saber duels and combat have gotten more and more ridiculous. But that doesn't mean the story doesn't wrap up nicely. Even though I do think Anakin makes the decision to go full evil a tiny bit to quickly he is still very well built up through the prequels.Aside from that Kenobi got a little too comedic, as there was a lack of comic relief in any other characters Kenobi throws out some now iconic/infamous phrases well known in the mind of star wars fans. It didnt ruin him for me personally.As well as Sidious, it seems like he became so evil he could not stop laughing. And at times he was just so clumsy, his expressions just cracked me up.One thing though that felt so much better was the dialog between Anakin and PadmÃ©, in Episode 2 it was simply put ...terrible. But here the writing was much better and the synergy was also much stronger.Like I said before I still am a little conflicted on Anakin's development. I think they really did a good job at showing him turning, slowly, event by event. You can only take so many setbacks and hardships, and combine that with his rebellious and arrogant nature set in from the first episode it makes sense for him to turn. But the speed at which he does horrible things namely the killing of innocent children was a bit too quick for me. I wish there was at least some resistance before performing the act, maybe they gave him no choice.. or something that forced him at the least, instead of simple orders.That being said I still really like this movie. And now having seen all 3 again as an adult I can say that what I liked as a child wasn't just because I lacked experience in movies or had no sense of quality. It was because all in all the Prequels were still an encapsulating story with yes.. huge spectacle with questionable CGI. But also a solid story in the end and some very memorable moments.",8,0,1,9 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Can I copy your homework? I'll be sure to change it so they can't recognize it.
","It saddens me that this sequel dips lower than the prequels in originality. The directors and writers were so insecure and scared that the only way they thought they could make this a success was to copy ANH. As a result, character become imitations of greater characters in the past.This movie had its moments, mostly visual. The acting and cast lacks charm and synergy that the OT had, The PT had the same issues, although it being a little more severe, the sequels still suffer from this to a certain extend. It's a combination of taking itself too seriously, and trying to squeeze in some funny moments. In addition the actors are too strong and fast learning, especially the main character. Where is the development?Because the formula is practically the same as ANH, I can't rate it a 1, or 3, or 5.. The acting from some is still decent, the visuals and cinematography are fantastic, it certainly stands above the PT and at times above the OT. Soundtrack is still good. Action scenes are well done.At the end, I wasn't bored throughout, but it left a bland taste in my mouth afterwards. Because it was so uninspired.Is it in many ways better than the PT's TPM? Yes. Is it original in the slightest? No. Is it better than ANH? Not even close.",7,1,8,12 November 2019
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Excellent.
","The task of concluding a series like Harry Potter is immense and scary at that, but without doubt it has succeeded in concluding it with utter satisfaction. A great finale wrapping up many loose ends and completing characters.I enjoyed this movie a lot more than Part 1, which at times dragged on and in general was paced extremely slowly, with some choices here and there.But in general I loved part 2, faithful and with much better pacing. Sure, at some times predictable like Neville chopping off the snakes head which made the scenes with Hermione and Ron a lot less suspenseful, but I was alright with that for the character.My last point would be that I would've liked some more focus and time on the actual death of Voldemort, the build up is excellent and extremely exciting but his death was quick and fleeting. I guess I wanted a little more focus on the actual death of the antagonist we've been fighting since day one.The 19 years later scene was nice, even if it was a bit cheesy, but it was needed to really close off the storyline and show that the characters now life peacefully, and *can* life peacefully.Definlity did not let down even though part 1 gave me doubts. Well done.",8,0,1,19 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The beginning.
","Pretty much flawless, in my little journey watching all the 6 star wars movie in a row as an adult this one as of writing this review is almost flawless. A perfect introduction into the Star Wars universe, with so much universe exploration, droids, all the different types of creatures and races, characters, the design of the world and most not to be forgotten the music. From the addicting music in the Cantina to the epicness of the destruction of the death star.That said the movies has a few shortcomings. Namely the very underwhelming saber duel and combat between Kenobi and Darth Vader, it is especially underwhelming when you've seen the prequels and their story. Aside from that Darth Vader's escape was a bit odd, it happens so fast if you blinked you might've missed him ''bouncing'' off the death star. Old Ben's sneaking through the death star also went on for a little longer than needed, it didn't really manage to build up the confrontation at all with his old apprentice. Also Luke's response to seeing his step-parents burned to a crisp should've evoked a much more visceral response in my opinion, it's almost as he's more letdown than sad.But really, besides the positives mentioned above, the movie just works so well because the acting is grounded, its so well done, and the characters have such a great synergy with each other, something that was completely missing in the prequels besides a few isolated moments. It made it so much more enjoyable to watch, the snarky responses, the banter. Whereas in the prequels this comes over as cheesy, it comes over as quirky and fun here. And this is me saying as someone who is in his twenties, not having been at the original release. I grew up with the prequels and I still like them to this day.In addition I found the directing and cinematography much, much better than any of the 3 prequels. ANH has some gorgeous shots. The CGI as well, how does ANH manage to have better CGI the 20+ year older prequels. There's obviously a lot more practical use in the OT, but the CGI that there was wasn't offputting. The only one that pushed it a bit too much was where Han was talking with Jabba. Because you get the sense of him just talking to nothing.The droids were fantastic in this as well, I never remember them having this much focus in the movie, especially the start. And I forget how mean C-3PO was to R2 all the time heh, loved the snarky responses.All in all I was a bit afraid the hype and influence of this film would kill this movie for me, I only saw snippets of it as a kid and never really fully watched it until now. I grew up with the prequels and those were just amazing for a young viewer. But I can't wait to continue the OT and finish it. This was a fantastic start.",10,1,2,10 November 2019
