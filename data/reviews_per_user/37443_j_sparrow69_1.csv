Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The scenes depicting Roamnia are far from reality
","For all those people who have not seen Romania, I must say that those images are completely not realistic. I know many can't even locate Romania on a map, not to mention having visited it. Those images show extremes, misery that may only rarely be seen in the poorest villages. And, to be honest, that can also be found in far richer countries, I'd rather not give names as I'd be making the same mistake this movie made. I don't believe it's fair to see that as the image of Romania, especially since if you see the country, you would definitely see the difference. Evereyone who's seen it has definitely changed their mind. I believe this movie creates stereotypes. It's OK to laugh, but this kind of generalizations can be harmful. I heard SBC apologized to Kazahstan for associating the image of an entire country with the scenes in the movie, when is he going to apologize to Romania?",Null,2,5,23 January 2007
