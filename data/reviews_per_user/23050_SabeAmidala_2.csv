The Ring," Good old-fashioned scary movie with just a few bumps
","First off, I must say that I really enjoyed this movie. Overall, I found this a very frightening movie.  It masters the technique of scaring people. The plot's absolutely brilliant.I'll just get the faults over as quickly as I can:Some stuff just doesn't make sense.  There's a fairly good conclusion, but there are a few ropes here and there that just dangle loosely. I heard a rumor that this is part of a trilogy, so maybe I should just shutup and wait hopefully more explanation.  But even then, there were occasionaly bits that just didn't really fit with the movie, were a painful attempt to be scary, and just should have been left out.If you can ignore those, however, you will find this a scary and enjoyable movie.",7,0,0,4 December 2002
Lilo & Stitch," Indeed, Disney has leaped from its deathbed in a fresh burst of life
","I've always been a fan of animated Disney families.  But even my stubborn attachment has not blinded me from the harsh fact that the films have been going downhill for sometime now with only a very few pleasant surprises.When I first saw trailors for this movies, I wanted to see, despite the nagging voice in my head that said it might not be that great.  When it came out, I was met with plenty of great reviews.  Unfortunately, my little college town is not known for a plethera of movie theatres, so summer passed and so did this film from theatre to video/DVD.  When a friend purchased the DVD, only then did I get to see it.What a gem! This twisted and poignant little tale is truly worthy of the name of Disney.The story itself is surprisingly clever and original.  That imagination alone is enough to love this movie.  Then the makers go throw in a bunch of delightfully varying and quirky characters, plenty of humor, and more charm and heart than should be legal.  You are able to understand the characters, know them, and, most of all, love them.This isn't just quality entertainment.  There are several great messages on the importance of family, no matter the kind, and redemption. That's something Disney rarely shows: Most of its heros are heroic at the beginning.  Yeah, the learn something and grow a little bit, but not to the extent of Stitch, Lilo, and Nani.  Stitch begins the movie as an evil and chaotic little alien.  Lilo is a twisted little child who could have grown up to be the next Carrie.  Nani is hardly the typical Disney female with her temper, frustration, and disorganization.  But even as the characters learn and grow, you love them for exactly who they are.The animation is to be appreciated.  It's a tribute to classic Disney hand-drawn animation, with just a touch of computer to give it that nice edge and finish.  Add plenty of Hawian color, and you got a film that is just great to stare at.I don't know where Disney's been hiding for so long, but I'm glad it decided to crawl out and start actually working under its reputation.This movie is with Disney's finest.(I'm also happy to say that this film was not a one-time thing. I had the pleasant opportunity to see 'Treasure Planet' last week. It's also top-notch.)",9,1,1,7 December 2002
