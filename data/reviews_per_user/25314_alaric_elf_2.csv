The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Wonderful!
","It is a wonderful movie. It has so much emotion, so much reality in it that it gets overwhelming sometimes (in a good way) Cast is wonderfully chosen and acted superbly. Well Done. I will watch it again time to time just to experience this beauty one more time. I already suggested, even enforced, it to all of my friends. So lines like 'I didn't think anyone would notice me' is an emotional arrow into the heart. This is the primary reason I have an IMDb account now. I really wanted to share a review about this movie being one of the best movies I have ever seen. I would suggest 'Don't even bother with the Trailer, just jump right into the movie and enjoy' You will not be disappointed.",9,0,1,16 May 2014
Captain Marvel," Oven vs Microwave
","So I don't like to movie then I am a hater? Of what exactly? Justice League sucked but Wonder Woman was awesome, Aquaman was great but Batman vs Superman was dull.Captain Marvel has minimum character development. Director Fury, goose, and skrulls were definitely good highlights. BUT, pretty much all of the major MCU characters have story arcs, big ones have multiple movies for character build up. Captain Marvel's story arc is super rushed, 'microwave cooked' to be serviced for Infinity War End Game.Also stop saying first female superhero lead movie, why does that matter? It doesn't make it a good or bad movie...",3,1,3,10 March 2019
