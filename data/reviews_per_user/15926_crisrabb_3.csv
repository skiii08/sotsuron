The Ring," Well... the horse was cool
","***small spoilers***Take a bunch of freaked out teens, a creepy kid, and a bizarre myth that turns out to be true, and what you have is Urban Legend, Sixth Sense, Nightmare on Elm St, and many others we've already seen.  However, if you add a psychotic horse... well now you have my attention!  I'm not a sadistic animal hater, please believe, but the mad horse on the ferry was AWESOME! I'm sure every necessary precaution was taken to to safegard the horses well being.The perpetually dismal, rainy setting was a nice touch too, but beyond that, the movie was nothing new.  The false ending was an interesting move, however, it made you expect more from the actual ending, and THAT'S where you got disappointed.  It's almost as if they weren't sure how to wrap it up.Just watch the horse a few times.  You won't be sorry.  Also, freeze frame on the teen girls face after she opens her bedroom door and sees the tv. One of the best scenes, and it's on screen for all of one nanosecond.",Null,2,3,20 June 2003
The Others," not too impressed
","This movie wasn't as good as I'd hoped it would be.  It did all the things I don't like a movie to do.  The first 30 minutes were full of false scares and unfulfilled suspense.  In the middle, there was a VERY long patch where not much of anything was going on.  Finally, an eight year old could have predicted the 'big exciting TWIST' at the end.One good point: The creators didn't use a lot of gore to make up for the lack of imagination.  I've always believed that what you don't see can be far scarier than what you do see (example, Blair Witch). Sorry to say I cannot recommend this one.",4,3,6,18 July 2002
The Sixth Sense," Hardly worth all the raves...
","This is a classic case of excessive hype building the viewers up for a let down.  I'm not saying this was a bad movie... just terribly over-rated. The ending was raise-one-eyebrow 'interesting', but hardly a shocking twist. Rent Primal Fear if you want a jaw-dropping TWIST!  The movie was ok, but I could have watched it on tv.  I'm sour enough over the $4.00 spent on the rental, but would have been in a REAL bad mood, had I plunked down $8.00 to drag through it in the theater.  To summarize: With the exception of the child, it was moderately acted.  Unoriginal plot.  Horribly slow paced. Sadly un-scary.  Terribly over-rated.",Null,0,0,1 April 2000
