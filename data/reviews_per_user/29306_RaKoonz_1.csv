Spartacus," The story of a slave fighting for freedom.
","This is by far the best movie that Kirk Douglas ever made. Douglas plays the part of Spartacus, a Roman slave on death row who is sold to a gladiator school. At the school, he is put through many exercises to turn him and the other misfortanat slaves into gladiators who will have to fight to the death when they are  finished with their training. But before they could get sold to the statium there is a fight in the mess hall and soon the gladiators have broken out. Spartacus has a plan to go and free all the slaves in Rome and fight back against it until things are the way they should be. Another face in this film is Tony Curtus who plays another slave who escapes and becomes a warrior for the gladiators in the war for freedom against Rome. The film was directed by the one and only Stanely Kubrick. This was one of his first films but still one of his best. The film also being executive by Douglas was a way to get back at Ben-Hur for not giving him the main role but merely offering him the role of Charlton Heston's enemy, Messala. Not being allowed the main spot light Kirk found a way to hit back at Ben-Hur with Spartacus.Over all I give this film a 4 out of five.",10,1,3,30 April 2002
